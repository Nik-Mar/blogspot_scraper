We went thrifting and to Starbucks.  They went along with my (crazy) idea to bring them lunch at the Nubble (in 20 degree weather, nonetheless).  And before I returned home for our evening routine, I snuck a quick walk in Ogunquit (and only crossed one other person on my walk).

Not even close.  When you're a grown up, you'll absolutely have more. You thrive on routine but crave new things. A sticky place to be at times, but audiobooks help you out of these valleys along with your fave sports (swimming and ice skating lately).  You're also excited about the book series you're working through: Swallows and Amazons.  Crafting has always been your passion and you always have new things you're enjoying.  Lately it's the intricate color books, weaving, making gnomes and pompoms, diamond art and jewelry. You care deeply about your friends and people in general. You care what they think of you and work your hardest to be at your best when you're with them. You were elected president of our 4-H club by your peers, what an honor! Day to day life is hard, hard, hard for you, but you keep keeping on. Someday I hope you can look back and say 'I persevered and it is worth it!'.  I'm front and center for all accomplishments and will always be your biggest cheerleader.  Happy 11.5 Audra!

{"title": "Snow", "date": null, "text": "We had our first 'more than a dusting' snowstorm of the year. Oddly I wasn't involved much with snow removal. That's because we have Adrian. He's seriously the world's best shoveler. Justin did the snowblower, but I took no photos to prove it. Audra spent some time outdoors.And then mass produced these. Anna-Kate was served snacks as she played outside. She also did some sledding.She certainly got her wish for snow, but it's definitely not snowman snow.I did some housework and rearranging. And made  A LOT of food. Trying to use what we have put away and what we've been gifted. I made a double batch of corn chowder, processed a homegrown hubbard squash, made a stew, two loaves of bread, two carrot cakes (one for the freezer) and cream cheese frosting and BLTs.  At the end of the day, it seems like there's not much left to show my efforts, as we're feeding a shoveling teenager now. I think one of the most favorite parts of living in Maine is days like today when we're stuck at home. We had time for good food, playing outside, a movie, board games and read alouds.  We had two fires going inside, so it was nice and toasty all day.  When it was bed time, we changed out of yesterday's pajamas into fresh pajamas. 10 out of 10!"},

We did read Christmas books. Not as much as I had planned. I got behind in blogging and way behind in housework. It's easy for me to get wrapped up on what I did not accomplish.

Let's see if I remember: 1) Festival of Fostering Trees: we donated the tree and ornaments and one of our fantastic 4-Hers set it up.  This reportedly raised almost $60,000 for youth aging out of Foster Care. 2) We did a winter gear swap for a week and a half and the leftover coats went to a coat drive. 3) We collected with local churches and the big kids help wrap and package food items for the food pantry. 4) Thanks our neighbor's tree farm(they let us trim away anything folks left and collect scraps), we prepped and hosted an evergreen centerpiece arrangement session and made over 75 arrangements.  We, along with 4-Hers and then community members distributed to various 'helpers' or people who could use some cheer.  We also made DIY kits and opened up our home for a make your own centerpiece arrangements to share.  We had several who participated in that.  5) We then packaged the remaining greenery and distributed 3 different types of greens to three different nursing homes, along with DIY packets so they could make centerpieces.  Before Covid, we used to do this with the residents, but now we just drop off. 6) We made and gave presents to a family our church adopted and then participated in the wrapping party to wrap all those gifts. 7) I've planned and hosted Friday Lighthouse Art and Boardgames at the library. 8) We were wrappers at the Kids Shop event at our local thrift store.   I loved watching the kids pick out their perfect selections for their loved ones. Oh, to be a fly on the wall Christmas morning with some of the unique purchases! 9) Our BIG Country Kids party at our house on Thursday/Winter Solstice. We'll be collecting donations for the special needs preschool in our area (craft supplies and monetary) and have a very festive time.  Everyone is invited, so do come!  10) Our family has some speaking parts in the Christmas Eve service at our church. 11) Usually around Christmas or after, our family tries to make a big batch of bread or biscuits to share with the neighbors. I think I got them all! It has been a BUSY month of serving, thankful for the opportunity to be a helper.

Tabouleh with the parsley, green onions, mint and garlic I grew. Cranberries from the Maine cranberries I picked with the kids.  And stovetop stuffing I had on hand and chicken I had marinated and frozen enough when they were on sale a few weeks ago. Then I made apple pie with apples we picked. And we had apple juice I made from said apples too. I had homemade rolls that I made and froze, but forgot to pull.  Plus homemade whipped cream.

We share our seeds, plants and produce. We help one another, we support and encourage one another.  We do monthly classes, teaching each other. We also have work days helping each other. Here's a pic of our stone soup meeting.  Everyone contributed things they grew and we combined it into a soup.  SO GOOD. Because I'm the best at helping and the worst at asking for help, I was reminded several times that I needed to schedule a work meeting at my house. Finally did and am thankful for the help I had mulching my ridiculously large for a family of 5 orchard. This was my before Thanksgiving garden list.

The rose of the unexpected start was that other friends were in the same boat, so we were oceanbound with friends.  The thorn from one of my kids was there was fear that the killer would shoot us while walking along the beach. How is this the world we live in now?!  Thankfully, I asserted that people who do heinous crimes are cowards who enter buildings and they aren't walking the coast identifying at the various species of ducks. The other unexpected was allllll those apples I was going to take to co-op ended up at my house.  We ended up being an apple pickup zone and the apples all have homes in treats and in bellies now, thankfully! Before bed, I learned that the suspect at large was located not alive, thus not a threat. While all of Maine exhaled a relieved sigh, there are so many pieces to pick up, things will never be the same.  In our farmhouse, the horrific events were probably brought up a dozen times this morning. Such small apple problems compared to what some are experiencing. A negative impact to varying degrees widespread. And so, what do we do as caregivers to these wee ones who have questions we do not understand and cannot answer?  We do the same thing we always do. We reassure and reassure.  We make food. We go outside.  We read aloud.  We give hugs and be the steady constant they need to calm their minds."},

The personal stories are rolling out from a 'friend of a friend', simply horrifying. Schools were all closed here today and likely will be tomorrow.What did we do? We served our community.  Because the helpers should be more active than the destroyers.  We gleaned nearly 300 pounds of apples (again) and had our homeschooling pals over to study slugs in our backyard.Praying for those navigating their life after this tragedy."},

It's all aloud, all the live long day, and at night. You begin and end your day with books, and sometimes books in between.  You love to read and read everything you see. You love anything academic and are a quick learner. You love people, are eager to socialize and bring gifts. You also talk to your animals and bring them gifts.  Your pretend play is quite elaborate and all the little figures talk when you play. Even the flowers have opinions. You much prefer staff than to get anything for yourself.  You'd rather have help than do any sort of physical exercise on your own.  You leave stuff hanging around and assume 'someone' will just take care of it for you. You've always loved colorful foods and still do! You'd eat a salad before tacos.  Fruits, vegetables, colored popsicles or lollipops are always preferred over something boring colored. You have definite options about clothing. You dress yourself and do quite well. You're usually the first one to the car.  You don't like scary Halloween, especially creepy ladies. You have elaborate ideas for costumes. but usually you end up as a princess.  This year, you claim it's pirate time.  We'll see! You're full of energy, fun and noise.  You give the best hugs and compliments.  It's such a joy to be your mama. I love you Anna-Kate.  Love, Mama"},

Impressive, huh?! I've been helping you get some odd jobs doing landscaping and wood stacking and you have a nice business going with your vehicle paintings. You are very, very responsible. You avoid your sisters, but don't avoid your mom (unless I have the camera) and you love talking with your dad.  You're a true introvert, but can play the extrovert part very well (like both your parents). You have a desire to grow up to be a man of character and your efforts show everyday.  I'm just so blessed to have you organizing me and helping me out everychance you get (often when I don't even ask).  You're a joy to raise, I'm blessed to have you as my son! Love, Mom, formerly mama  This is the only other picture you let me take of you, so I'm posting it!"},

Four birds, four adventures (and we did see what we set out to see each week, phew!). This time I ended the class with a 'Draw and Paint Along with Me', which the kids did really well with and enjoyed. It was tricky for me because not only had I not done it, I'm not a confident artist and I had to make the drawings simple enough that I could explain how to do it. They not only enjoyed it, but asked for more. (phew!)  My favorite classes to lead are these wander and wonder sort of classes.  They are a lot of work, but worth it.

Your fave meal! Your most favorite thing in all the world are two things: People and animals. You love your people with your whole heart. You are thoughtful, giving and try to be really good friend.  Day to day life is so very hard for you, but you will push every single ounce of you to put your best foot forward when you are with friends.  Your animals are your love. They comfort you, motivate you and organize you.  You are never, ever mean to your animals. You love them so. You are very creative when you decide to create.  You have a variety of craft interests and tend to hyperfocus for a time and then take a long pause before returning. That's generally how you tend to do things: either a lot or not at all, but you like audiobooks consistently. One of your most favorite foods is eggs.  You would eat scrambled eggs for breakfast, lunch and dinner if we let you. Your most fave activity is swimming. It's so organizing for you. You could care less what the temp is.  You're ready to jump in even if it's frigid.  Your other new activity is disc golfing with dad.When life is a mess, your new go to is piano. I love how you fill the house with hymns. With birthday money, you plan on buying new 'old fashioned' clothes for reenactment. I suspect you'll also buy gum and maybe some clip on earrings and gingerale. Girl, there is no one more in your court than me. I am committed to help you through your day to day and pray one day things will get easier for you. I'm eager to see the great things this next year will bring you. Love, Mama"},

Here are some highlights. 1) Bushes for the birds: When we moved in, we basically had two long hedges and a large field.  The birds stayed on the hedges.  Now that we have an orchard, I'm delighted how many birds hang out in the trees.  I thought if this empty corner of the property had some bushes then the birds would circle around our property. I put in 9 quince, 6 azalea and 3 viburnum. All from friends or marketplace. (Thank you!) I still have that big mess of perennials in pots to plant and deal with. Still working on it.2) Peonies!I've wanted peonies here for a long, long time.  There's a plant here that has never flowered. I cleared around it and waited. Nothing. I moved it and waited. Nothing. I found all these for 50% to 90% off last year and boom!  Peonies!3) This blasted rock garden. I tell you, this will be the death of me.  SO MUCH of this has turned to weeds.  We've had such hot summers that most everything on the rock garden has died and basically turned to weeds.  I am not done yet, but have logged SO MANY hours out here.  Hopefull you can see progress here.Most everything is stuff that I either dug and potted before they mowed the lawn (below) or moved from elsewhere. Getting there.  Still a lot to do. Other random gems: I love growing lettuce around annuals in our out front boxes.  By the time it bolts, the annual will probably fill the bin. This is lettuce I sowed in March in the jugs.  Still eating it now.The Jerusalem artichokes are everywhere and apparently love the rain we've been getting. We ate some this spring for the first time.

{"title": "My White Farmhouse Homesteads ", "date": null, "text": "My dad just sent this proof to me.  I didn't recognize at first glance, but now I see it, clear as day. This is the farmhouse that I grew up in, circa 1984. This home, this yard, this homestead has the most joyous memories for me.  In 1984, I was three and had a one year old brother.  My mom wasn't sick and my dad kept the homestead full of animals.  In this picture I see the barn with the hayloft I enjoyed having tea parties in.  I think of the pigpen and lambing quarters.  I think of the winter days with the cows all in their scansions, my short dad standing in the gutters to clean them, with the radio blasting.  I see the chicken coop, with the nesting area that is in my barn now. I see the rock that my mom planted tulips around. I used to pick those tulips to bring to my teachers.  I see the big garden, the one I picked all the miniature unripe tomatoes for my dad one year.  I see my swingset and my mom's clothesline. I see the place we played wiffle ball and the driveway I jumped rope in.  I remember having popsicles on that picnic table. I see the garage that was always full of sawdust and housed the electric fence box that we had to turn off for a show, so our one station on TV wasn't static. I see the pole barn that smelled like tractor oil and sounded like peeping baby birds.  I see my beloved trees and remember playing under them.  Of course there's my beloved farmhouse.  I'd enter with a swing and a slam of the screen door, get asked a 2nd time to leave my boots in the shed.  I was read to, fed, played with, comforted and was loved within these walls.  It's a bittersweet thing, remembering my childhood that was so lovely but also grieving that those years were short before my mom got sick (and subsequently went to be with Jesus). I will always love this homestead and the memories made there.Thankfully my heart is big enough for one more farmhouse love. This is where we live now, this picture is circa 1969.  It's so fun to compare and contrast.  My current garden is is opposite their main garden. All the hedges are so overgrown now.  Flowerbeds have obviously expanded. It's sad to see the white fence and the two attachments to the main barn were removed last year with our barn saving process, although a good thing that the barn is surviving. The house is basically the same. It's a lot more to clean compared to my first farmhouse above, that's for sure!  I work so hard maintaining this homestead, I hope and pray my kids will look back at their childhood farmhouse with the same amount of fond memories I recall about my own childhood home."},

Raised beds are the plan for direct sow rooty veggies with tiny seeds that are harder to start in wood chips.  In my Back to Eden garden the garlic is looking great. My first winter over of lavender was successful.  Trees have all been pruned and I did a bunch of grafting. Eager to see if the grafts are successful.

I dug up more burning bush and barberry, finally circled the house and have re-done all the gardens around the house edges. Only took me 10 years. Now to decide where to put the raised beds and to fill them. Leaning towards lining them up like a fence perpendicular to the house. We're putting chives in everything we eat and trying to use up last year's stash (pumpkin bread from pumpkin I froze last year). I still have a gallon and a half of raspberries, this is the most we preserved ever.  Someone eats raspberries just about everyday, all that we picked last year.  I'm also almost half the way through selling raspberry sucker plants.  This year I will likely sell out with just my facebook friends and not even post on marketplace.  It's a busy time of year, but a good time to be a homesteader."},

I had no idea.  It has lots of iris cousins, but not all iris flowers are native (such as the bearded iris have been introduced from Europe and the Mediterranean area). They grow best in full sun, rich soil with moderate moisture, but at this farm, they were in lots of nooks and crannies, but not the nooks and crannies that I could really enjoy them. They were stuck along the house and not really blooming (picture above shows the bittersweet intermingling, ugh), stuck in brush and within brambles, under trees and in a swampy area in the field.  I spent a good part of the fall moving lots of them into organized clumps and paths in spaces we frequent where we'll be able to SEE them.  As in I'll be able to look out my kitchen window and see them instead of having to go on a scavenger hunt to find them. I put a whole row along our back walkway and I put big clumps next to the front steps. The seeds probably spread and the rhizomes multiplied and it was HARD to dig them up, they were so thick. A lot of effort and sore muscles, but I did it.   I'm so excited for them to pop up and hope the move doesn't mean the blooms will skip this year. I'm ready to see them and see the bees, butterflies and hummingbirds enjoy the blooms. Plus you know they will end up in bouquets."},
{"title": "Garden Talk: Mexican Bean Beetles", "date": null, "text": "Today is a day for a grumble. First about the foot of snow, then about Mexican Bean Beetles.  It's because I'm thinking gardens and organizing seeds. Do you have them? I have a horrendous problem with them. They totally decimate my bean plants.  In latin Epilachna varivestis mulsant....which must mean little beastly beetles that make me want to holler words I shouldn't say.  It starts with little yellow eggs under the leaves of the plants, then these little black and yellow fuzzy things that just crawl around and eat the plant. Then BIG FUZZY yellow that stink and make a mess when you squish them and then finally these orange spotted beetley thing that just wants to lay eggs and start the whole thing again.  They make the leaves skeletons and reduce the production immensely. 2-3 hatchings a year and then overwintering in the soil. Beastly they are. You can learn more about them and see their pic here.I probably could take a pause in growing beans in hopes the over wintered beetles would find a better home.  Don't want to do that. I do try to do crop rotation, but they always come back. I am against using an insecticide.  I don't have the capacity to pick each one of things things off by hand.  I found a way to combat these.  Know what I do?  Plant A LOT. As in 5x what we need.  When the beans come in, I pick and pick and pick.  I can pick enough for us to have daily beans and plenty to preserve before the beetles have their feast.  It doesn't cost me any more than space because I am still able to save beans from the plants every year to plant the next year.  This has been my strategy for the last few years and it has worked beautifully.  I wish the Mexican Bean Beetles would just go away and I'd not have to strategize, but at least the strategy has been working.Now if only I could only solve other dilemmas in my life with such declaration..."},
{"title": "Engineering ", "date": null, "text": "Big kids took a 6 week virtual engineering class through 4-H. It was really well done. They enjoyed it and learned a lot. My gardening adventures have taken on a whole new path with our long summer absence.  I leave my husband here and the kids and I spend a good chunk of the summer with family on the St. Lawrence River. My husband isn't an enthusiastic gardener, so I try to leave him with minimal care.  I plan my garden differently, putting in more that will ripen before we leave, less varieties that ripen during our absence and a bunch that will ripen upon our return. I'm also doing more long term plantings rather than just annuals.  Plus, mulch, mulch, mulch. There is certainly a learning curve, but my yield, although different if we're here all summer, is steadily increasing. My orchard is at 17 trees strong.  I think there are 4 from 2013 (there were 5, I lost one plum), 7 from 2015, 1 I transplanted in 2016 or 17 and 5 from 2022. 4 are pits, 13 are pomes.  With the cost of some store bought bagged apples over $1 per apple and me having alllll this field I'm itching to plant, I figured apples are a sure way I could expand.  It would be great to someday have plenty to share with friends, malus domestica for all!  So, what goes into apple grafting? That I'm learning.  I bought scion wood to add gala (girls' fave), baldwin (winter ripening) and freedom (disease resistant) apples, but am also planning on saving some scion as I prune this month. I bought 10 rootstock I plan to graft it onto.  Plus I have five apple trees on this property that are full sized and healthy, but the apples are not good.  I plan to graft both rootstock and established trees this spring. I'll pot up the rootstock apple trees for a few weeks before getting them into the ground. Haven't decided if I'll plant in my garden for a year to strengthen and make sure they are watered or plant directly in their forever location. I also have plans to do a soil test. Apples need slightly acidic and I really want to work to maximize the soil to have the best product I can. It's a lot of work now, but hopefully 4-5 years from now I will be glad I put in the effort.  Someday when all is producing, I will have late summer apples, fall apples and winter apples (which will be stored in the basement for winter ripening/use). Thankful for the confidence I gained in giving this a whirl from my Master Gardener Volunteer coursework and my dad for giving me birthday money to buy all things grafting."},

{"title": "Estuaries", "date": null, "text": "My Master Gardener Volunteer assignment is to select a Maine Natural Area and reflect on it. I got to wondering, what has been a huge part of my life as a Mainer that is much different from my rural NY upbringing?  One of my favorite places to go is where the tide meets the stream, the tidal marsh estuaries around us. We have SO many options in Maine and I love to go to them year round.  The wildlife we see is more than anywhere else around us. You are practically guaranteed to see something if there's nice-ish weather. The birds and waterfowl I could watch all day.  I love counting egrets, watching herons toss up fish and eat them head first, watch the nesting gander turn her eggs, count the number of ducklings and the list goes on.  We've seen eagles and osprey.  Once we saw otters play. The flora fascinates me.  The amount of ferns, mosses, skunk cabbage, cat tails and reeds and the birds these all attract holds my attention. I love hearing my neighbor talking about how they used to harvest the saltgrass for cattle. Maine blueberries are abundant in some places. We enjoyed the red dogwood display in Scarborough recently and enjoy the cottongrass beauties of the Wells Reserve.  Bushes and brambles are so important, but it is really frustrating to see the expansion of barberry, multiflora rose and bittersweet along the estuary edges. Maybe someday I'll be able to help with efforts to reduce the invasive species.  Until then, I'll continue to explore and learn as much as I can with my kids and their pals. If you've not spent much time hanging out in estuaries, I'd encourage you to do so.  We just so happened to visit two different estuaries in a week: Scarborough and Wells.  Pictures follow.  If you're a long time follower, you've seen many, many other estuary pics.  It's just a habitat worth visiting again and again.Scarborough, MaineWells, Maine"},

Whatever you decide, you do it with your whole heart.  And then all of a sudden, it's no longer fun and it will sit awaiting your return, no matter how many months it takes for you to circle back.  Next up is piano lessons, which you're fully on board for.  You are a mover and a shaker.  Cartwheels all the time. Standing on your head, upside down. Twisted this way and that.  Never a dull moment. Ever.You'd almost always prefer a normal day to a holiday. Holidays are fun and exciting, but very stressful and emotional.  You are very, very generous.  I think you spent all your money getting me gifts for Christmas.  You also spent all your time making all the girls you know braided bracelets.  You probably made 50.  And if you have a friend with pierced ears, they will get a dozen new homemade earrings from you at a time.  You love people so much and work your absolute hardest to always be an excellent friend. Although you often take the really really long way around to get started, once you get going with your school work, you're a whiz, picking up things quickly and remembering everything. Your half birthday dessert pick was ice cream in between two chocolate chip cookies.  What a great idea.My girl, you are the hardest worker at life that I know.  You keep on keeping on, even when the going gets tough.  I'll always, always be your #1 supporter because I know you can do anything you set your mind to. Love, Mama"},

All not permitted! 45 minutes later, a visit inside two different customs buildings, we got papers and were permitted back in the United States. Such an adventure. We kept on moving and arrived finally at my home sweet home. We arrived to a snow covered cabin. All the cooking and baking is required to be done on the woodstove. The hot water is only on at certain times of the day. Apparel is t shirts because the woodstove cooks us too. Every knife is super sharp. A full view of the stars from my bedroom window. Morning walks with no vehicles. Wildlife outnumbers the people. Deer all over. Partridges drumming. Geese honking. Woodpeckers tapping. Owls hooting. Frozen frogs to thaw. Where there's nothing to do by wordly standards, but yet there is everything to do. Projects aplenty.  It's the town where some of my most favoritest people live, memories and stories get told wherever we go and the St. Lawrence River paints the most beautiful picture in my soul.  While I love my current house in Maine, a part of me will always love the very rural north country. (The tree I planted with my mom at the school)"},

{"title": "MGV:  Food Insecurity and Volunteerism", "date": null, "text": "I've been accepted to and have commenced my training as a Master Gardener Volunteer.  As a part of my training, I'm required to keep journal entries. I figured I'd just add them here, thinking my readers may enjoy hearing what the program entails.  The first module focused on food insecurity.  I must admit that I am very removed from this topic, having never experienced food insecurity myself.  I'm so fortunate that I grew up having plenty and also learned how to grow and raise my own.  My kids have had a similar childhood.  As a part of the assignment, we had to look up our county's status at Map the Meal Gap. You can look up your area.  In the county I live in (York County ,Maine), there were 19,670 people who experienced food insecurity in 2020, which is 9.5% of the population. In the county I grew up in (St. Lawrence County, New York), there were 14,660 people who experienced food insecurity in 2020, which is 13.5% of the population.  Food insecurity for our country is 11.8%. These are just alarming rates, especially considering all the food we waste.  These numbers are our neighbors! There are many things going on already to combat this. I was unaware of gleaning efforts in our town (Spillers Farm) that Master Gardener Volunteers participate in.  While I have purchased things for the food pantry here and there for a number of years, I have only dropped a load of produce I grew once and dropped off seedlings I started once. Once I led my 4-Hers to make cookies and donate.  I've also dropped off pumpkin bread at a homeless shelter a couple of times. I volunteered in a soup kitchen with my kids once. Tiny small things that are something, but not enough. I'm inspired to do more and do so regularly. I could do a much better job gleaning from my own garden. Before Covid, we had signed up to help at our local food pantry and no one showed up for that shift to put us to work. We did have a random person who gave us a tour, but I must admit that I was discouraged from that one non successful visit. I think it's time to try again. I have a personal goal for our family to do better this year in helping this food insecurity problem.  Something each month seems attainable.  I had the kids fill a bag at the grocery store this week and we just donated that.  Small things to spark a series of doing more to help in 2023.  If many of us work at this, we can make a difference."},

I don't even have to ask. That's how he starts his day everyday.  He takes care of all his things and his room is always tidy.You think that's great?  It's just as good at the end of the day too.  When it's bedtime, he tidily does his nightime chores.

You talk to yourself, you talk to others, you've never met a stranger. You sing, recite poems and narrate all you do. We can leave you in the bath and be far away and not worry, because we can HEAR you. Sometimes your dad offers to pay you for a bit of silence.  You'd rather talk than have money. You are so independent in so many ways (such as choosing your wardrobe, tidying up your toys, choosing what order you wish to put the letters of your name in) and so 'little' in other ways (such as you'd like to be carried places and have someone buckle you in, even though you are plenty capable). You love books-being read to, looking at pictures on your own, listening to audio and the animated books on Kanopy. You have many mostly memorized, such as Smart Little Mouse is a fave.  You are eager to learn, love to 'do school' (provided you can do it your own way, of course). Other than books, I'd say your next fave would be Spanish. You are quick to pick up everything and have some poetry, songs and books memorized in Spanish.  You also love nature, especially edible plants. While you are perfectly happy playing alone, you love how Adrian has made a special nook for you in his room to come play.  You love how Audra dresses you up and plays old fashioned with you. You love people of all ages.  I mentioned that you talk to everyone, but you also have a skill in getting other people to talk to you. You ask questions, give compliments and remember things. People of all ages love you. So far you're not competitive at all. Playing games with others is about connection, not winning (which is like your mama!).  Out of all people in the world, I know I'm your most favorite.  I worked a lot of hours when your siblings were your age and work much fewer hours now.  Whenever I am away from you for an hour or two, you think it's forever and express your love for me with a giant hug.  I'm so thankful I got you, my 'one more' that I begged for.  You are a perfect grand finale for our little family and we love you so. Love, Mama"},

Tidy room. Wash glasses. Get dressed. Brush teeth. Take care of animals. Find another chore that needs to be done.  ALLLLLLL that is done and I don't tell you a thing.Then you go about your day.  Drawing. Painting. Riding bikes, swimming or hiking.  X country ski or ice skating in winter. Making dioramas.  Learning about trucks.  Waving at trucks and getting them to beep to you. You do all that with gusto until you are called to eat a ginormous amount of food and then claim that you are still hungry two seconds later. You love listening to me read and have been getting a bit more into reading yourself. But, you only read to yourself during the appointed times.  Afternoon quiet independent reading for 20 minutes (you set your watch). And bed time reading. I should mention your evening routine.  Pajamas, clothes in laundry, brush teeth, turn back covers, devotions and reading.  Like clockwork. It's glorious. While you still love your mama and plan to live with me for always, you are also seeking out time with dad more. You enjoy people of all ages and have no problem striking up conversation with anyone.  You are an introvert though, and need time alone to recharge (which is hard to get with two sisters who never want to be alone). All in all, you'd say that your life is pretty grand, but would be better if you didn't have to do math.I am proud of your heart and how you desired to be a good friend to all. I'm impressed by your close attention to detail. Thankful for your dependability.

{"title": "July day", "date": null, "text": "Today as we were picking raspberries, Audra was asking about what life was like when I was her age. Flashback to a typical day in July in 1990. I'd wake up in my room and fly downstairs.  There would be a dog or two to greet me.  I'd head outside to take care of my bunnies and perhaps pick a snack or two from the garden. I might pump my legs on the swings a few times before going in for breakfast.  After breakfast, which was likely an English muffin with peanutbutter, my mom would send us to get our bathing suits on to get ready for swimming lessons at the beach (on the St. Lawrence River).  If we got our suits on, we could watch Zoobilee Zoo until it was time to go. (I am 100% sure this was for my brother, who did not want to swim, but always wanted to watch a show!).  We never were able to finish the whole Zoobilee Zoo show, as we had to get to lessons. We'd hop in the blue stationwagon, that was already starting to heat up from the day. We'd get to the beach and I'd sprint to my swim instructor, eager to get started. My brother would harrumph all the way, stand there shivering, declaring he's never going in.  He'd eventually end up going in and we'd have a jolly time diving for tin foiled rocks after our lesson was finished.  The moms would sit under the pavilion, snapping peas or beans, laughing away. Sometimes we'd stay at the beach and have picnics with friends.  Then we'd take one slide down the metal slide that would practically burn our bottoms before we'd get the car and manually crank our windows down as quickly as humanly possible.  Then we'd pray and pray it was a day we'd stop at Parkway to get a slushie. If it was a slushie day, I'd make that thing last until we got home and did afternoon books with the slushie.  Then we'd pray it would not be a haying day, but instead a day that we could swing on the swings and forage in the garden until we were called for dinner. Audra quipped, \"Wow, that sounds a lot like our day!  Do you do our days like your mom did your days because she was such a good mom.\"  You know, I hadn't thought of that. I guess so. Audra claims that she will do everything I do because I'm such a good mom.  And that comment right there pretty much made my summer.  In case you're wondering, here was our July day, which just happens to be quite typical to our everyday summer day. The kids basically woke up and ran outside. They tended their animals and helped me pick raspberries. I pulled a few weeds and they went on some adventure with butterfly nets in each of their hands. A couple readings and then shooed off to get swimsuits on.  We rode those ocean waves, got them a little french fry treat, came home just in time for their 4-H classes (Adrian is taking watercolor painting and Audra is taking Fiber Arts).  Free time followed until dinner.

You keep us on our toes allllllll the time. My most favorite thing about you is how you love others.  You love your friends so much. You make things for people, buy things for people with your own money, you focus your free time energy on your animals.  You have a heart for serving. You are a mover and a shaker.  Cartwheels everywhere.  You see a hill and think it would be fun to roll down it. You build ramps to have a better sledding adventure. You body surf waves like no one I know. If you have to go from point A to B, walking in a straight line to reach your destination is not even considered. You are crafty, crafty, crafty!  You pick one craft and spend all your energy on it.  Then you decide it's enough and abandon it for months.  In the meantime you pick up a new craft for a spell and the cycle continues.  When you do finish something, it's always most impressive. You've enjoyed sewing, carving, flower arranging, crochet, needlepoint, weaving, carving, paper crafts, embossing, quilling, needle felting, hooking, friendship bracelets, beading, plaster of paris, painting, baking, adult coloring books and the list goes on and on on and on. Now, picking up the mess that that craft project made...well, that's a work in progress! You are as quick as a whip and absorb everything. When we think you're not listening, you always are.  You remember everything, love books and use a very expansive vocabulary in everyday language. The one hobby that comes in phases and you keep going back to (which I love) is your old fashioned dressing up. You love to watch youtube videos about dressing in various time periods. You enjoy dressing up and playing the role. You wear all the layers and get Anna-Kate to join in. You're spicy and sweet all in one. You wake up everyday and do the hardest things you don't want to do. I know you have to work harder than most to stay regulated. You're doing it though and learning and growing at such a rapid rate. I'm so proud of all your efforts and I will always and 100% be the one who believes you can do anything!  Happy birthday my 10 year old! Love, Mama"},

The bookends of our day are read alouds. They bring us together and anchor our days. I read a little each morning and a little each night. Consistency adds up! Some days our read alouds did go like this, lol.  Anna-Kate was mad that she is never the middle child and she wants a chance and she never gets a chance. Adrian's faves: Kerplunk and Phantom Toll Booth.  Both are humorous. He'd probably add the four book series 'The Saturdays\" and four book series the \"Moffats\" to his favorite list too. I read them aloud and he went back and re-read them on his own. Anna-Kate loved Chatterer the Red Squirrel and basically Thornton Burgess in general and Brambly Hedge. She also listened intently to White Bird by Bulla. Audra about had a meltdown when I told her to pick two, so she narrowed it down to 8.  She loved Ocean Born Mary (set in Strawbery Banke), Lucy Whipple, the 4th book in the Lily Lapp series and Abbie Burgess (Maine book).  Plus she loved (well, we all loved) Canadian author Shirley Woods' animal books. We read four and are eager to get our hands on more. I'll mention a few great books that weren't already listed. I loved the Birds' Christmas Carol by Kate Douglas Wiggin, Emily's Runaway Imagination by Beverly Cleary (never read it before, it's my top Cleary book now!), The War that Saved my Life and sequel The War I Finally won and Old Fashioned Girl by Louisa May Alcott. Plus, I cannot tell you how many times I've read or listened to Anne of Green Gables, but decided I'd read it to us even though we're all very familiar.  It was my first time reading it aloud and I literally cried through the whole ending. Now it's time to pull next year's books so I have room to reshelve these. Any recommendations? Books 2020-2021Books 2019-2020"},

{"title": "A Literary Day", "date": null, "text": "We have been long time fans of Chris Van Dusen (author & illustrator). I found out he was giving an art class not too far from us. There were only 20 slots, we were lucky enough to get three.  It was only $20 total for my three kids to attend, I would have paid oodles more. It was so good! After the class, a couple families lingered for book signings.  We had a long time with the book signing and got to chat. We left the event room feeling so lucky.Then we were wandering around the short term feature Children's Literature Gallery of Illustrators (I made up the title, not sure what it's officially called, but it is FANTASTIC). Chris Van Dusen did a lot of work to get it set up, which was why he was there. We were the ONLY ones in the art gallery and noticed that he was there touring it for the first time too.  We were able to do part of the museum with him!  He stopped at all his paintings and told the kids how he did it, what went wrong, his thoughts of why he did xyz.  He knows Adrian is an artist and gave him some tips. At the end of the day, Adrian said that this day was a 10/10.  Audra said today is a day she will remember for the rest of her life. I will remember how Anna-Kate raised her hand during the class and said \"I don't think your drawing looks like much Mercy Watson\", to which he kept telling her he's going to practice his drawings so he'll get better (LOL).  Before today, his books were a big part of my kids' childhood.  They are even more beloved now.And then the gallery....we LOVED it.  The kids found original art of so many of their fave books.Some matching.This is another illustrator they have met and chatted with.  Matt Travers.  I traded a loaf of bread for a signed copy of one of his book a couple years ago. Kids talked his ear off.And back to more Chris Van Dusen.Definitely a day to remember! Pleased to report my week ended better than it started! The barn project phase 1 is done for now, phase 2 next week.  I'm currently working on massive peony planting (yay!) parallel to our walkway.

No more old fashioned homes staged in there. No more, no more. I'm someone who has always, always hated change. Even when the change is necessary and good.Next step will be lifting this barn and I am praying it all goes as planned. In order to drown out the noise in my head, I garden.

The barn is being lifted, excavated with a new concrete foundation. As a part of this project, the back addition of the barn and cattle lean needs to be removed (the people we have working for us are going to do the best they can at keeping what is not too far gone, but it's mostly in really rough shape). I'm also losing all my elderberries (sob).  Trying to transplant what I can, but they do not like to be transplanted. I had wanted to remove the newish floor in the addition before they knocked it down, so basically today was the day to do that. It was MUCH more work than I anticipated.  The hugest deck screws were randomly placed and very hard to find. Once I found them, I needed to clean out the dirt to even unscrew them. Plus they either required a starbit or a phillips, little rhyme or reason as to what went where. I had to take a break to work this afternoon, and that break was MUCH needed. I was back out after dark and finished before bed.  I'm sore, sore, sore. Somehow I single handedly removed 95% of the new floor.  (I left a couple boards because I was and am just done.)I did have my supervisor keep me company for some of it. He's also a supervisor who delivers water.  He thinks I'm out of my mind crazy for saving all this wood, but I don't care.  I could have a heck of a lot of raised beds with it! Or use it to repair barn flooring in other areas. Or bookshelves!  Okay, probably not bookshelves with it, but something! I'm just so glad it's done. It was NOT on my to do list today, but it is on my DONE list, finally!  And my kids had a fine day and all talk at once once they get home.I think I'm not the only one who enjoys the reprieve.  (Chickens too).I'm REALLY hoping tomorrow has less unexpecteds.

Except for my work hours, I have all the time that I am usually homeschooling  to myself for housework and projects, so the plan goes. I only got a small fraction of that list accomplished.  So many unexpecteds happened today. I'm habitually someone who reminds myself of all that I don't do, but I'm trying to shift that narrative and be glad for what I did do.Four loads of laundry, some gardening, some wood stripping and homemade sour dough pizza is not nothing. Not what I expected, but still not nothing. The best part of the day was definitely them coming home, ironically. They were so excited to tell the fun they had. This was Anna-Kate's first time away alone. She was super excited. I asked her if she missed me and she said, \"No. I didn't even think of you all day.\"  Well, I'm glad she had fun! Hoping tomorrow brings less unexpected, but either way, I aim to be kinder to myself and focus on the good instead of the undone. The started a fire today and made hot cocoa. Then the girls were inspired to make it an extended outdoor cookery experience in their matching mama made dresses with aprons.  I love when they get into pretend mode, I could listen to them all day!  Today they were poor, too poor for shoes.

There is no one more critical of myself than me. This picture, though, embodies what I hope to be from the lens of my child. The mama who always, always, always tries.  The results may be imperfect but the intent consistent.  Here's the other pic of the day.  My trio with leftover take out pizza (thank you to my husband for a meal off from cooking), with that same shabby old sweatshirt from high school that I finally ditched. Motherhood is the least glamorous activity of my lifetime, but I'm praying it's the one that reaps the most fruits."},

The kids always seem to have an activity, a virtual class, a service project, a playdate...something.  And I still do my regular job as a speech language pathologist and have regular meetings and commitments for all my volunteer gigs.  Sometimes it's hard to fit in the homesteading that I also try to keep to.  Yesterday, we had nothing on the calendar.  At first my kids were trying to get me to add something to the calendar.  The tide shifted as the girls remembered their old fashioned dresses. They suddenly had loads of ideas and found plenty to do at home sweet home. I suspect these two prefer the days our calendar is filled."},

He gets out of work at 4:30 and then walks to his car and drives the 2.5 miles home. He gets out and comes home like clockwork. We can expect him at the same time everyday, he's very consistent (unlike me, I never arrive home from work at the same time). We were finishing up a book, expecting him to be home and my phone went off.  It was a text that said, \"Running late, leaving now.\"  That was at 4:39.  I popped on facebook quickly right after and the top story was posted at 4:36 that an accident direct center between our house and my husband's work had just occurred.  A head on collision to be exact.  Had my husband not been grabbing his employee of the month swag and talking a wee bit more to one co-worker, he would have either been in the accident or have seen it. He arrived just before/as the rescue crews were arriving. He was just minutes behind a head on collision that ended up being fatal.  Today I grieve for the families who are experiencing devastation while simultaneously praising God that the steady predictable timeline was disrupted for my employee of the month.  Let us not take today for granted.

You give 4-H type presentations for fun (and actually presented at the local competition, even though you aren't old enough). You are an enthusiastic gardener and a connoisseur of wild edibles. You smell like a sub from all the green onions you gather and consume. You like to help cook and pretty much eat anything.

I kept each method covered in old salad containers for mini greenhouses. Paper towel on clay balls, stonewool and good old soil. I actually really liked the ease of just dumping pepper seeds on the clay balls and you can easily see which germinates. The germination seems best on the clay balls.  Whatever didn't germinate in the soil, I could easily fill the cells in the packs that were empty from whatever germinated on the clay balls.. Sometimes the roots got stuck in the papertowel, so that was harder to transfer. Pinching off the bit that was growing from the stonewool was easy and I kept a bit of the fiber with the roots for better transplant. Not the best pics, but the three methods:Using the grow table my dad made me.Zippy is thrilled.My soil blocker is my new favorite toy.Some things have been planted, some are already are up.  Some indoor things grown and consumed.Some outdoor things grown and consumed.And this one is starting some preserving.Five new apple trees have been planted.And a whole bunch more is planned!  We are eager for gardening 2022!"},

Happy Resurrection Day! Our day began with 4-H, included bread baking, a lot of cleaning and laundry and we also got started on getting things ready to plant the fruit trees. But, we also made some time for family time.  When we have nothing in particular scheduled for family time, we tend to do a trio of activities: 1) A family hike.  2) A visit to a library in the area that we hiked (Maine has a reciprocal borrowing program in that we are able to visit and borrow from dozens of libraries across the state that are a part of the consortium.) 3) A thrift store local to where we hiked. It's our fabulous trio that costs us next to nothing and we all enjoy our time together.  Here are pics from our trio of activities: 1) HikeFirstborn: First one ready. All put together, with water bottle filled. Second born: Free spirited.  One just never knows.Third born: No we will not carry you.

A pile of wool, flannel, Christmas and bug fabric and some whites and navy blue. Audra brought home yarn.This library had all sorts of activities set up and each kid got a whole gift bag for Easter full of activities.  We have a few books we borrowed (that we can return at our own library if we so choose!). The activities kept her busy for quite a while at home too.It's was a weekend day like so many others, but we just love family time with a hike-thrifting-library combo.

You like what you like and you don't care if no one else likes it.  You are STILL into farming and most of all trucks.  You love Greenlight die cast 1:64 reproductions and would collect them all if you could.  You love setting up scenes and making supplies for your scenes.  ALLLLLLL the glue and the modpodge and the tape and the mess. When you have computer time, you research this sort of thing. When you have spare time, you draw or paint this sort of thing. You like what you like.You are a boy who loves a routine.  You get up, make your bed, get dressed, put your dirty clothes where they go, brush your teeth and start morning chores. It's like clockwork.  You love a morning when I read to you so you can draw. You like to take a walk in the field and then spend your spare time doing truck stuff. Then you faithfully put your clean laundry away, journal about your day, read your devotions and then read whatever series you are working on (right now it's Happy Hollisters), listen to your audiobook and go to bed.  Although you're not upset if the routine changes, you'd prefer the steadiness of the familiar. Although you say you're not a sports dude, you love hiking, archery, swimming, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, ice skating and biking.  You are friendly and can talk to anyone, especially if they are willing to listen to you talk about trucks. You always say \"It doesn't cost a thing to wave\".  If you are outside, you are waving at whoever is driving. People honk at you even when you aren't outside. People call you \"the boy who always waves\".  You have a hearty appetite and love all food but mushrooms and eggs. I never have to ask you to clear your plate, you always do. If you could pick any dessert, it would always be a fruity dessert.You still plan on being a game warden and sometimes you get your sisters to play game warden. You are a rule follower through and through and have quite an interest in nature. You've long been a mama's boy only, but now you're switching from being mama's boy, to being Mr. Independent to having only eyes for daddy.  Your sisters drive you bonkers.  You are unique, responsible, driven and almost always all business.  What a joy it is to see you blossom before my very eyes.  Proud of who you are growing to be. Love, Mama"},

It's more the figurative quicksand that has been getting me, like the quicksand of parenting and life. The other day I went to buckle Anna-Kate in the car seat and then ran back to lock the house door. As I came to the house, I noticed the doors were WIDE open. Both of the doors swaying in the wind.  Inside relaxing were my two dogs.  They could have easily have had a jolly frolic, a dig in the mud, a roll in some dung, a lively game of 'you can't find me!'.  But, they did not.

It's our everyday and so enjoyable and comforting to us. After school and cleaning, we managed a trip to the library, sledding, virtual 4-H tree club and the promised Dr. Quinn episode we never got to this past weekend before more books before bed. Three more perks of the day: 1)I used my birthday money (thank you!) for upgrading my baking cupboard flours/oats/sugar storage. I bought my old set 18 years ago and it was just so tired looking. I wanted to change to glass, but dimensions wouldn't allow me to store as much in this space.   I measured to maximize space and am thrilled. They fit, they are huge, they are functional and sort of pretty. Yay! The canning jars in the front are topped with flip/shake tops from Parmesan cheese that I have saved over the years.  Did you know they fit standard canning jars?  Save those tops, they are useful! 2) I'm trying to have an exciting new meal for Mondays since Mondays are the only weekday that I do not work. Creamy Cajun Chicken with zucchini. So good.  I sauteed shallots, colored peppers, hot pepper and garlic and added orzo.  I cooked the orzo in just enough broth to cover it (adding more as needed).  I dumped some half and half in there to make it creamy with salt, paprika and cumin. Topped with chicken, zucchini, parm cheese and parsley.  It was a hit, everyone loved it! You could easily make this with rice.   3) Audra took this pic.  He's wearing a wool vest I made him.  She's wearing pajamas I made her and slippers Nam knitted her. Bangs she cut herself (sigh). Life is always sunshine and roses, but reflecting on the good before I retire for the night leaves such a warm feeling in my heart.  Tuesday, I am ready for you!"},

I restored a couple of pieces of cast iron we had (link here), freshly seasoned my existing cast iron and purchased this 6qt:.And this campfire swing:Today I had no problems getting them to stay outside after getting some exercise.  Four hours outside on January 13th in Maine is pretty darn good.  (And we only came in because I had an appointment).  The kids made the fire on their own. We boiled water in the tea kettle Audra gave me that I restored (I think she paid $3 for it!). Hot cocoa.Then I popped blueberry rhubarb crisp on the hook. I was going to have them make it, but we ran out of time and I just made it.  It is rhubarb they picked and froze last spring, however.Since we had to wrap it up before it was done, I did finish the crisp in our gas oven inside (because a 6 qt. dutch oven will not fit in our wood cookstove), it was mighty tasty!  The first of many more outdoor cooking adventures with our new supplies.  Thanks to the grandpas!"},

Not perfect, but it is now functional! And the hard work on the kettle here:Two non functional pieces now functional!

We have good days and exhausting days and we keep plodding forward, with your mama as your champion cheerleader encouraging you every step of the way.  You, my girl, can do hard things and brave things. You already have and you will again and again.  I'm right here to help you along.What you love most in the whole wide world are your people. Your friends and family are everything to you. You think of loved ones when they aren't around and make them pictures and write stories about them. You even turn your math problems into tea party planning with your friends (15x3 : I can have three friends over for tea and each can have 15 different cookies, how many will I need?). You've never met a stranger, you make friends wherever you go. Conversation is never lacking!  You also would spend all your money on gifts for other people. You are just that generous. Your next favorite thing are your animals. You have such a way with all animals and spend lots of your time with them. You have never really played with toys, you much prefer playing with your animals. You also love books. You like to get up with the sun to read, then listen to an audio during breakfast, then you listen to me read to you in the morning, followed by audiobooks in the afternoon, with me reading to you again in the evening, with you reading to yourself thenafter and then you listening to audioboks before you fall asleep.  Whenever you are lost in a book, life is spectacular in your eyes. You spend your time when listening to books doing something crafty: weaving, crocheting, embroidery, painting, baking, coloring, anything crafty. I love that you are still into your old fashioned dress up fun. You really like dressing Anna-Kate up (she's so willing too!).  You go on adventures, have elaborate tea parties, pack your valises, set up house. I just never know what you are up to, but it's mighty engaging!   You most definitely would not play dress up when going places, you are very particular about looking sharp in your jeans and boots when we go places (and shopping is where you like going best!).Academically you are a whiz.  You pick up on everything quickly, remember things with ease and perform without a problem. Last year we did the standardized testing and you got almost every question on the test right.  One thing we're learning about you is you have a lovely singing voice.  I really love listening to you sing Christmas carols.  You have been loving winter sports: x country skiing, skating, sledding.There's an adventure happening? You're the girl who definitely wants in. Always up to try something new and exciting!  You have so much spunk and spice, I often ponder what will you be when you are a grown up?  Alas, that's a surprise in the making, my unpredictable and spirited one.  I love you so very much and I will forever be the one who believes in you. Love, Mama (Lace up shoes you wanted for Old Fashioned play)"},

{"title": "9th Annual Country Kids Re-Cap", "date": null, "text": "Usually I do our annual Country Kids Party during the warmer months.  However, I just didn't organize my brain full of ideas to make it happen.  In effort to squeeze it in before 2021 was over, I suggested to the kids a Winter Solstice Country Kids party, which they enthusiastically agreed. My kids loved it so much that they want it an annual tradition, so I will write what we did in effort to remember. The party started at 4pm, just before sunset.  Instead of having our typical ice cream stand, we had a hot chocolate and homemade pumpkin bread stand until all our guests arrived. We gave everyone glowsticks, which froze, so we will have to think of a better idea for next year!Then we played games I mostly made up: \"What time is it Papa Elf?\", Santa Sack relay (which the kids were confused, lol) and then some package tossing competitions with Team Fed Ex and Team UPS (had the adults help, much more successful!), followed by Reindeer Tag. I have kind neighbors who tolerate my megaphone.We then gathered around the toasty fire and I read Night before Christmas and had Christmas Mad Gabs for the adults while my elves (Thank you Justin and Ella!) spread candycanes all over. Then the kids took their flashlights to find all the candycanes. Festivities were over at 5:30.The kids chose 3 Dogs Rescue (where we got our dog, Copper) for the charity and we were able to give them a nice donation. I dare say that this may have been my favorite Country Kids party yet. Super easy to set up, less materials than usual. Only drawback is the snow made us have to limit how many could come because we had less room to park vehicles with the snow.  Anyway, thank you to all of our friends who came, I think my kids will remember it forever! I wish I got more photos, but some is better than none! I make sure my kids work, since this is a service project and not just a free for all fun project. Adrian had check in and Audra was the barista. Check in:Snack standGames, which look like they are on top of Anna-Kate's head.FriendsAnd fire.Kids say we should do a summer solstice party too.

But, I'm leaving those behind and focusing on how wonderful Christmas eve with friends (thank you W. family!) and Christmas day with family was. I am so thankful for these reusable cloth bags, they make wrapping a snap.   The kids opened their stockings first while dad slept in.  They love how Santa supplies them with snacks mom never buys.  And as a bonus, it's breakfast, thanks Santa! Apparently Santa left a couple of brand new things, daddy is the most surprised.After the Santa is all wrapped up, Audra always insists mom has her coffee and opens the first gifts, which is just the sweetest ever.Audra got me this bowl that I said I liked, but didn't buy. She swung in and bought it for me and I didn't know! Anna-Kate got me owl socks, candy and a little gnome she made last month and kept a surprise.  Adrian got me a John Deere hat so we can match. And my husband was surprised by all the great books he bought me. Then the kids gift each other the things they bought for each other. Even Anna-Kate did shopping this year.  I can't remember everything, but I will try to remember a few. Audra got Adrian a John Deere mug and she got Anna-Kate some fancy jewelry.  Adrian got Audra a bike bell and Anna-Kate a box of miniature animals. Pictured below is what Anna-Kate got her siblings: A builders kit and a crazy headband. Fitting. She was so proud!After that, we opened presents from parents, our wonderful Mary, my dear aunt and uncle and a surprise package from Justin's high school friend (thank you!!!).  It was all a delightful mix of books, crafts, vintage, homemade, personalized and just exactly what everyone loved.And then daddy.  Well, he's just the easiest to shop for. He got lots and lots of food. Plus the worst movie on the planet that he quotes from (Audra found it for $1 at a yard sale). And I can't believe it...I gave him a book and he dove right in and started reading it (he's not so into the rest of our bookish ways)!Here is Adrian (the one who organized all the gifts, trash and recycleables as we opened and cleaned up all the mess after...his idea). And his loot.Audra Grace.And her loot.Anna-Katherine and her chocolate face from the yummy homemade donuts our neighbors delivered (thank you!).And her loot.Then after Christmas, everyone was enjoying their new gifts and I got to just relax for a bit....other than the turkey feast I decided to make (why do I make more work for myself on Christmas, who knows?!)."},

I am not a minimalist when it comes to books.  This library is dedicated mostly to picture books....because I have other places for my chapter books and still more places for my vintage books and still more places for my personal encouragement books and still more places for my craft books and still more places for our school books and of course the kids have shelves in their room.  A run on sentence because that parallels to my book storage.  It runs on and on and on...What can I say?  We read a lot when we are home.  If we are not home, we are listening to audiobooks in the car.  I read to my kids for an hour at the beginning of the day and an hour at the end of the day.  We take a rest in the middle of the day to read on our own.  Plus the kids and I all read on our own before we go to bed.  Books are a big part of our lives.The budget for furniture for this little library was $0...because I prefer to be thrifty. Someday we may invest in better shelves, but right now, I used what we have or could locate for free.  Many, many thanks to my neighbor who gave us the couch and chicken lamp. I still need to decide what I will put on the wall over the couch, but anyway, this is what it is for now (suggestions welcome!).Without further ado, do come to my favorite spot in our house, our (mostly) picture book library. These are mostly picture books, with some historical nonfiction on top. The cabinet holds games.The other side of this shelf has more picture books and our audiobooks in bins.This shelf holds activity books and picture books below. The far shelf holds some classic works, Spanish books and games (I keep meaning to stitch a curtain for the game cabinet.The far left is the science shelf (and also a shelf I found on the side of the road for free and painted up. Picture books for history on the left, picture books for science on the right.This is the science shelf i got for free on the side of the road. This is history, the shelf I found in the house and painted. The end shelf is mine as a kid and it has some chapter book biographies.The red shelf has some story puppets on it.  I also found that shelf in our house, fixed and painted it. It holds puzzles mostly. Still wondering what to put over the couch. Horsehair plaster makes me want to be 100% certain what I add before making holes.This concludes our library tour. I have shown you the chapter book library space, pic below.  I suppose I could take more pictures of the various book nooks around our house if there are any other book nerds out there.  Thanks in advance for not telling me I have too many books, for can one ever have too many books?

I have found that this is the best time of year to plant parsnips. They start growing as the ground is thawing!  100% of this garlic I planted, I grew last year.  I have plenty in the pantry to hopefully last us the year.  The parsnip and cilantro seeds are also saved from previous years.  My library card catalog is filled with seeds. I still have piles on the counter to sort and file away too.I dug the rest of my annual bulbs (dahilas, glads, canna).  I need to do this earlier because I am wheeling them in the garage overnight and back out to fresh air to dry out for winter storage. Not working smarter, definitely harder. I did plant the 200 bulbs I got for spring. I have a few more perennials I was hoping to move. I have barely put my perennials to bed, I still have cranberries to plant and a few more strawberries I hope to pop in. They may or may not take, it's an experiment.  I am trying to get some of the rhizomes of the quackgrass weeds, those are so invasive. I also have two loads of woodchips I'd like to get spread.

The house had been vacant for a while so I was trying to clean it too.I remember when my dad came for Thanksgiving and moved us all over here from our other house, only a half mile away.  I just cried and cried, I was so thankful.  But then everything kept breaking and I'd be cloth diapering without a washing machine. Then no dishwasher. Then the water pump broke. And the furnace. Somehow we moved in and didn't shut all the storm windows and were freezing.  And then of course we still needed to sell our other house. It was a year of surviving, I barely remember it.  Would I do it all over again?

You could spend hours looking at books, cutting things out with scissors, building things, creating things, arranging tiny pieces.  Everything is interesting to you and you can entertain yourself quite well when provided with just about anything that's a manipulative.  You are a great eater and enjoy a variety of tastes.  You're the only one who cheers for mushrooms.  You also get excited about things like asparagus.  You told me you didn't really like Halloween candy, and instead went out to snack on collard greens. You still love colorful.  And yogrit. (AKA Yogurt).  You have so many cute little sayings.  Gloves aren't glubs anymore, but we still have things like katennas (for antennas), underbrella (for umbrella), broth for bra and so many more I can't think of at the moment.When outside, you're not a fan of bikes or balls. You would prefer to collect eggs (checking every few minutes for a new one), tote the rooster around, boss the dogs around, forage for food or garden. You also do quite a bit of singing to yourself. Did I mention you are never quiet?  Never ever.You miss me when I'm gone just for a couple hours and when you see me again, you holler MAMAS!!!! and run for a hug. You give the best snuggles.  You especially like to crawl in bed with me and read books.  You would do that anytime, you are always up for books and snuggles.  You bring so much joy to our family, we are so thankful for you, Anna-Kate. Love you bunches, Mama Funfetti cake topped with frosting and sprinkles for our colorful girl."},

{"title": "Lost and Found", "date": null, "text": "When we bought this house, it had a cast iron dinner bell outside. It was taken off when we did some replacements of rotted parts of our mudroom years ago.  Ever since, I have not been able to find it. I looked in the barn, garage, cellar way, cellar.  No one remembered moving it. No one knew where it went. I honestly had assumed it was accidentally thrown away. Today I just so happened to move a piece of wood in the woodshed and lo and behold, I found it!!!  I am over the moon!!!  I cleaned it up and am planning a fresh coat of paint.  It was a bit more of a search, but I also found the cast iron stick to ding it with (not picture). All was located and is ready to use.To be honest, life as of late has had numerous trials. The work of the mama of the house is one that is forever going, always trying and struggling to not grow weary. It seems three steps ahead and maybe five steps back lately. Will I ever complete anything?  Am I doing the right things? Will the 'to do' list ever get shorter?  How can I even do the things I ought to do for me? Is my best enough? I'd like to say this isn't my internal dialogue, but it is.  It's hard to keep the energy when it feels like life is a treadmill going a few clicks too fast and the dial to turn down the speed is missing.The turning up of the dinner bell came at a time when my self doubting was rambling on. It made me stop in my tracks and turn the tide. The dinner bell is a story of hope.  Something I had lost was to be found. Something missing was located. The problem worked itself out.  It was right here, all these years under my nose.  Certainly not the timeline I expected, but it all worked out in the end. Sometimes the day to day overwhelms. Planting one seed at a time, awaiting the harvest is tiring work that requires patience. I have faith the harvest will be grand. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. (Galations 6:9)."},

But they do not complain. This is 100% from my husband. The first time any of my kids have complained (because what kid doesn't try that out?), he had a talk with them.  \"Your mom has worked hard to make this meal for us.  You are not to complain, ever. You say 'thank you' and eat what she has prepared\".   That's the same way my husband (who went to Culinary Institute of America, so could do plenty of critiquing) has always treated me around meals.

There are some things I learned that I will do better and some things I am thrilled with...just like any year with gardening. Always learning and growing. This year I grew the very best array of cherry tomatoes. Something enjoys ripe tomatoes in the garden, so I pick them just as they turn to finish ripening in my window.  I have been getting perfect tomatoes this way, no blemishes! We have had a steady stream of tomato sauces and salsas.  No one is complaining...yet!I think my favorite thing I grew this year was this mystery squash that came from the compost. It is basically the perfect squash ever.  When small, it's like a zucchini, except its lighter in color so it's easier to pick.  When it gets huge, it gets a hard outer shell like a winter squash, in which I can scoop the seeds and puree for a side dish or to make into pumpkin bread. I did both and they are so good!  The bonus is it grows as a trailing squash, like pumpkins do, so it's been producing steadily all year.  It is the very best all purpose squash!!! I saved some seeds, but don't have much hope that if I planted them it will be as perfect as this mystery variety has been.Seed saving.  I do a ton of seed saving. It takes up most of my fall. I actually bought seed envelopes last year, so they look all official stored in my library card catalog. Very little of what I grow comes from new seed packets.Tri colored beans, tri colored seeds. Apples. This is about a third of what we've done.More to do, and we have been enjoying apple baked goods too. Scones below.Flowers.  I am thrilled I popped in some glads before we went away late July. I am getting a steady stream of glads now in Sept.I am also a big fan of this variety pack of annuals I ordered from Fedco.  Plus my dahilas and I'm hauling in pumpkin after pumpkin.  We do smaller sugar pumpkins for baking. I have a big box full now and more are turning orange in the field.Basically I am still hauling in a little of everything and anything.  Greens, herbs, garlic, turnips, carrots, parsnips, potatoes, peppers, etc.  Pretty much every meal has something homegrown. Thankful for my helpers, I have steady help and I am thankful for that!

Okay, so the literary value leaves a lot to be desired, but here I am, 40 years old and finding what would have made my dreams come true 30 years ago. At first my big kids thought, \"This is weird, it's like Elmo.  We're too big for Elmo.\"  (Totally not Elmo).  And poor Anna-Kate was terrified and had nightmares. The bigs would say 'I HEAR A FRAGGLE' and she'd hide behind my leg. But they thought, \"Mom doesn't do TV, but we get TV time if we give Fraggles a chance.\" Well, friends...we've made progress. They are now fans, sing the theme song and ask for \"Just one more episode\", even though they know I'll say no. They would like to whip through this entire lot of DVDs, but that's not how mom rolls.

{"title": "Old House Transformation: Mud Room", "date": null, "text": "In our 1880s home, at some point a tiny little mudroom was added off the kitchen. It had windows on all sides, so it was really only a narrow bench when we first moved in (which basically became a dumping ground.  A few years ago we found out one of the windows was rotted through and needed to be replaced. I suggested we instead just sheetrock it and put in cubbies. My father in law made that happen on the inside (thank you!) and my dad put wooden siding on the outside (thank you!).  For no good reason, I never finished what was started on the inside. So, what did I finally do? A shelf was moved up to make room for hooks, I mudded, spackled and turned the eggshell color to a crisp white. I painted the door red. Hooks we found in our attic went up.  I pulled up the carpet and found wood floors (YES!) that I sanded and finished.  Then I bought some baskets and a rug and found other random things around the house. It is totally different from before, much more functional. It cost us next to nothing, because we already had almost all the supplies.  I am so happy with it (although all the bins are empty because I still have a box of random stuff I need to determine where it goes).

Pretty much the same as 10 year old Adrian, 9,8,7,6,5,4,3 or 2 year old Adrian. You have liked what you like your whole entire life. Tractors. Cows. Trucks. Related machinery. You still collect all these things with wheels and love setting up farms and quarries outside. You sometimes let your sisters join. Sometimes. You always have a truck in your pocket.You also love to eat.  You've barely started eating a meal before you ask if there are seconds or what's for dessert or what's the next meal.  You pretty much eat anything, except you cannot stand eggs. You ask 10,000 questions every minute.  Okay, that's an exaggeration, but that's what it feels like sometimes! You enjoy routine and are very responsible. You keep your room just so. You know what your jobs are and you usually do them without being asked. Often you will step up and do a job you know needs to be done, just to help.  I think your favorite job is hanging clothes on the line in the summer and shoveling in the winter. You are an amazing artist. I have given you prompts each week over the last year challenging you to take your drawings to the next level and they keep on getting more intricate.  Your trucks in particular are so detailed, 3D and now have all these shadows. You enjoy swimming, horseback riding, biking, x country skiing and nature walks. You are excited to take up archery lessons this fall. You plan on being a game warden. Your newest hobby this past year has driven me crazy. You love to get trucks to beep at you. You wave to everyone.  People are constantly beeping driving by...which you love.School would be much better, in your opinion, if you were just read to and you could draw simultaneously all the live long day.  But, writing and math, and you are doing better coping with those things you want to go away. You love being homeschooled and frequently say that you want to be homeschooled your whole life.I think my favorite thing about you is your heart. You get along with people of all ages and try to say and do kind things for everyone.  You try to stay on the right path, but when you fall off, you are good about apologizing and working to do better. Your quote today is noteworthy: \"I don't really want to be a teenager, I don't want to grow up. I just want to be 11 forever.\"  11 is that fabulous.  I am looking forward to a full year with you as an 11 year old, Adrian!  Love, MamaAdrian requested a photo of all of them.Nicknames: AdriHow old are you? 11What is your favorite color?

We counted how long the cormorants stayed under water (about 23 seconds is what we decided), perfected replication of the mourning dove call, we made habitats for toads and frogs, we caught minnows with a net, counted the legs on a crayfish (10), tried to see if there was a difference between freshwater muscles and salt water muscles, we tried to decide if the inland marshy wetland kingfisher was the same as the one that frequented our dock, noticed the seagulls all head upriver at dusk, but are spread back out by the time we awake in the morning, we noticed the great blue heron tends to swoop in after the seagulls have departed, we watched the heron flip the fish to swallow it whole (always head first!), we watched the mink slither away (Holly helping with some barking), noticed the trees that are dead on the islands from the acidity of the cormorants' poop, snorkeled for underwater flora and fauna in action, noticed the fish who had a fused dorsal fin and which had split, we looked for beaver activity and noticed the habitat change from the beaver activity, counted ducklings (and unfortunately noticed a steady subtraction in numbers), were intrigued by osprey babies and enjoyed watching mama feed them, stopped in our tracks and looked up when Anna-Kate yelled \"Bird of prey\", we dealt with more earwigs than we ever would like (did you know the moms guard their eggs?), found cicada exoskeletons,  collected more insects, moths, butterflies than I could tally (so many more black tiger swallowtails in NY, more Easter tiger swallowtails in Maine), we know about plants to stay away from (we do not want the wild parsnips...even if they provide more back tiger swallowtails!...but we would gladly take some roadside chicory, not any on our roadside in Maine), we're working on developing our weather prediction skills/cloud reading and we count our blessings everytime we avoid a collision with deer on the roadway. I could go on and on and on...Daily we read about nature and recorded our entries in our nature journals. Kids kept a steady supply of mandalas with current finds. Flowers always on the table. Buckets always full of something. We school year round because summer nature is too good to miss...none of us want to pause our nature interests.  So few pictures, but we have pages upon pages of nature journal entries from our time at camp.

I personally don't like having five thousand layers when it's 90 degrees, but they apparently don't mind. I have been gone w/ my littles out of state at our camp since July 30th. My husband joined us for some of the time, but he was mostly holding the fort down in Maine, hanging w/ our chickens (Thank you Justin!). There were a couple weeks of blog posts that I scheduled ahead of time, but I haven't written a blog post since well before we left.   We were at camp, not only our typical mostly media free lifestyle, but also internet free.  A glorious break with family, immersed in books, a wee bit of sewing and painting, frequent nature spotting and multiple times a day fully submerged in the St. Lawrence River.  And food.  Lots and lots of cooking and eating. Riverfront dining daily. Rest assured, my blogging pause is over and I'm back at it!  Vacation photos will be forthcoming.  The funny thing is, although I absolutely love photography and taking pictures in my spare time, I have relatively few pictures from our time on vacation. Once I get with my loved ones, my photography goes out the window, as I seem to love being with my family more than I like taking pictures! I got to see my beloved family and quite a few of my late mom's friends. My mom died 25 years ago this August, but her memory was so alive as I remembered her with many of my mom's siblings' families and my mom's friends (who have also been a source of support and encouragement for me). On the anniversary of her death, we were dining as a family with our tremendous view of the river, my heart so joyful of all that she has taught me and of the 15 years of memories I have to share with my beloved littles (who seem to be not so little these days). Projects here at the farm are carrying on.  I am branching into new gardening with my woodchips and there are parts that were successful and parts I want to tweak for next year. I remain confident that this method will work for our family, even with me being gone almost all of August and not tending it.  I am working on what to plant when and what to skip.  I want enough to freeze before we leave and some to freeze when we return, but not such an abundance that my husband has to deal with when we are gone. But, I want enough to feed him when we are gone.  It's sort of like starting brand new, planning and preparing a whole way of gardening.  My apple trees are finally producing quite a big and the deer have taken notice. Hopefully the return of our dog scent will deter them.  Zippy (our cat) is over the moon thrilled to have us back.Now what? Well, laundry to start. Piles of it. The Speed Queen is earning her keep! The chicken coop needs attention, there are weeds that need pulling, produce that needs collecting.  On a larger scale, we need to do some barn work and I have plans to create a laundry room (get that laundry out of the kitchen), finally getting my vintage farmhouse sink installed and new flooring in the kitchen. We have been working on a bathroom renovation that I cannot wait to be completed.  It's finally in working order, but we are awaiting a few specific things as I try to keep some things that will match the character of the rest of our house in our brand new modern bathroom. As we dance around the bigger projects, you will find us outside or curled up with a good book or taking another dip in the ocean while we still can.  I will be purging, organizing and excitedly preparing as we spend another year of homeschooling at home sweet home. Oh, and the fair.  Of course the fair.  Kids insist we return in time for the fair. Thank you for coming along for the ride with us, I appreciate my growing number of readers who enjoy following our journey on my little ol' blog.

No tears.  I hugged her and told her again how sorry I was.  Wise beyond her years, she said, \"I know these things happen, but it's still sad.\"  Audra went to grab a pullet to snuggle.

They can read as much as they'd like, in as many books as they'd like. I asked them to at least work on two books during our afternoon book time.  If they finish a book, they can feel free to search for a replacement. Although they complained at first (we are too old for naps, this seems like a nap!), it has been marvelous.  We get time apart with no sibling squabbles. We get quiet. We relax wherever it feels most relaxing. (Screen porch, hammock or hammock swings have been hits.) We pick a pet to snuggle (thankful we have plenty). They are picking up books (and enjoying) ones they haven't picked up before.  I have been making a point of joining them with my own stack. I am thinking that this afternoon book rest is not just for summer reading. I am thinking this is a new addition to our life when we are home sweet home. It just might be my favorite part of the day."},

You keeps us on our toes every hour, every minute, every second.  100% of the time we keep tabs on you because we just never know what you are up to! Your loves are your animals.  You spend lots of time with them, caring for them, talking to them, snuggling them. You are eager to meet other animals out and about and love to watch and catch animals in nature. You love, love, love books. You enjoy reading on your own, you enjoy being read to. You could listen to audiobooks by the hour. Sometimes you read to Anna-Kate, which is precious. You are never, ever alone. You don't want to be alone. You like to be within whoever's bubble you are with.  You enjoy playing with Anna-Kate and Adrian and never understand when they need a break. You like to lean on us, hold our hands, you still try to sit on our laps (which doesn't last too long anymore). There is no such thing as being too close to the ones you love! You enjoy dressing up and pretend playing in different time periods. You have quite the collection of old fashioned apparel, but you are also apt to whip something up with playsilks, grain bags, fabric scraps, whatever! Your first choice when you get screen time is watch youtube videos about clothing in different time periods. Your favorite athletic adventure is swimming.  The Atlantic Ocean is too cold for most of the world, but not to you!  You spend hours submerged. Your first full dip of the year was in April this year.  You just love swimming underwater. You are a smart shopper and a great gift giver. You make the best cards, crafts and paintings for others.  You really love your friends and are on your best behavior when you have a playdate. You do not like things that you view boring or hard.  But once you try, you are very capable, a quick learner, athletic and excellent at remembering.You have a hearty appetite and love all sorts of things, especially eggs and potatoes. You love things that will make a meal fancy, such as frilly toothpicks, fancy napkins, ice cubes, the best plates. Organization isn't your strong suit and we laugh that we always know where you are because we can follow your trail. You are hilarious. Your vocabulary is strong, your wit is quick.  You say the funniest things sometimes! You, my girl, are a one in a million.  You take every ounce of energy I have most days, but it's worth it. You have a great heart, you desire to learn and grow, you love deeply and are going to do great things in your future years. There is no one in this world who loves you more than me.  Happy birthday, my nine year old. Love, Mama  Questions:Nicknames: I don't have a nickname.

I knew the girls were asleep, but I suspected my oldest wasn't yet asleep.  I called him down. He was so confused. I assured him he wasn't in trouble, but we were heading outside.  \"What?  Why, mama?\" he asked. \"Just come,\" I urged.  He came barefoot, in his pjs that are getting a wee bit too small, clutching his favorite stuffed animal, a puppy named Lucky. Once he was out there, he quickly realized why I dragged him out of bed. He exclaimed his awe a number of times as the sky lit up hither and thither. We huddled together watching the spectacular nature fireworks show. I am pretty sure he smiled the whole time.  He told me his bucket was full. Mine was overflowing. It's hard to believe that he's nearly 11.  Whenever I think that, I automatically start thinking of the newborn bundle who only wanted mama, the two year old who called me 'seet mama' (sweet mama) and wore tails wherever we went, the five year old who was still sobbing when I went to work, but would sit for hours reading books with me when home, the 10 year old collector of John Deere who likes when I hug him until he decides that's enough hugging (minutes can go by).  How is my time with him home more than halfway up?  I need to shut that voice down and turn that voice into \"I get to\". \"I get to watch the fireflies with him.\" \"I get to help him with what's tricky.\"  \"I get to celebrate with him when things go well.\"  \"I get to coach him when he needs support.\"  \"I get to be the one who he loves most of all.\" I think he'll remember tonight forever.  I suspect I will as well."},

He did not want his picture taken, but I will enjoy that memory forever.  Love my history lovers. I am realizing that I document our homeschool journey so little, which is odd because it not only takes the most time out of all that I do, but I also spend a significant amount of brain power learning, planning, deciding and executing.  I am not someone who follows a boxed curriculum, so my mental energy is often in homeschool mode figuring out the who, what, when, where, why and hows about things. For our family, I believe homeschooling is a lifestyle, so we homeschool year round, each season having a different pattern, rhythm, purpose and plan.We've been enjoying our slow starts to these spring days with read alouds with simultaneous painting/drawing and then planting/gardening the rest of the day. Adrian said:  \"This is just the relaxing morning that I was hoping. I can't think of anything more perfect than listening to books while painting and then doing a little big of gardening.\"  I love his thoughts and I also love his truck paintings and drawings (drawing/painting trucks is his favorite hobby).I just invested in these watercolors, which I highly recommend. We just finished this book, which I highly recommend too. It's basically a nature journal/nature diary of an owl and the man who worked to rehabilitate him set between Maine and Vermont. It was written for 9-12 year olds, we read it as a family read aloud. I was as excited as the kids to get back to find out what happened.We've all kept nature journals for years.  These are different faces from Owls inspired by book, drawn by Audra. I cannot pretend the rest of our day is successful and smooth (although I wish it was so), but our mornings have at least been off to a good start with our spring morning rhythm. I don't know if my readers out there are interested in our homeschool journey, but perhaps I should document our homeschool days a wee bit more.

I told them I'm more thankful than sad.  I never felt unloved. I was always cared for.

I set it up between two maples that I have been fertilizing and caring for, hoping they'd grow enough for shade in our all sun backyard. One is a source of shade, finally (hallelujah) and the other is on its way. We ate outside for just about every meal these last 10 days.  Plus I bought stuff for ice cream sundaes and stuff for s'mores. Lilacs are in full bloom and our secret garden (which was garden for decades and is so overgrown) is gradually having the layers peeled back (will I ever get it back to a non overgrown state?!).  The kids pretty much spent a heck of a lot of time outside the last 10 days. I dare say we have an amazing place to quarantine. Can you see the maple on the left of the picture below?  That was a random seedling when we moved and I said, \"Please grow and provide shade for us, have heaps of manure to help.\" Look at the picture above on the right.  That's the next tree I'm giving growing pep talks to."},

I kept a picnic basket in the car with napkins, tin cups, tin plates, utensils and a blanket. I would make big batches of min muffins and individually package them in the freezer for grab and go. When it was picnic day, I'd grab some muffins, a cucumber, some fruit and cheese sticks and we'd be off someplace new.  Most of the time I did the picnics alone, but sometimes our schedules worked so Justin joined us. Such good memories.I was going old photos and it just so happened that the place we randomly selected May 2021 was the same place we went together for a picnic in May 2014.  The last time we were at this fort, Adrian was 3 and Audra was 1 1/2.  See here: http://www.bornimaginative.com/2014/05/forts.html .I have a mission to reinstate my old picnic idea. A new picnic spot every week.  A lofty, but fantastic goal.  Only now, I'm not making mini muffins to feed my crew. I've decided a hearty meal in the roasting pot, wrapped in a towel, tossed in an LL Bean giant bag with paper plates, utensils and a serving spoon is the better way to go with these big eaters. 2021-bringing back the picnic.

Had fresh eggs and homemade toast for breakfast. Then we read. We drew in our nature journals. Played outside. Had a delicious picnic. Read in the hammock. Made some paper. Hosted 4-H.  More outside play. Had a delicious dinner. Read more books. (With a bunch of laundry and household chores sprinkled in).  A day that's not so different from other days. When I pause and look at our life from a bird's eye view, I'm thankful our everyday has such beauty in what it is. I'm thankful my husband and I have collaborated and sacrificed to create a lifestyle with a routine that helps our littles thrive. The fact that I get to be home with them more than I'm away (which has gradually shifted to be this way over our parenthood journey) is a gift I'm thankful for. Today was awesome.Thankful to my husband for putting this up. I notice my kids wearing lots of mama mades. I notice they are getting along and laughing, hallelujah. I also notice my gripe about this yard 9 years ago was that there was no shade out back. This maple had self seeded. I cleared around it by hand (this entire picture used to be brush), fertilized the maple with heaps of manure and hoped it would take off.  I asked my husband to put this swingset on the north side of this tree last fall (which let's be honest, he looked at me like I had three heads when I said this, but did it anyway).  See that afternoon sun?  See the north side of the tree? Afternoon shade! Specifically designed shady place to play, visualized by mama, built by daddy.  And to see the littles enjoying it is the best Mother's Day gift!"},

She loves them because she can just wear them all day and be ready to go outside to play whenever the mood strikes her.Part 3: Both girls love their new mama made pants, only they aren't just wearing them for outside pants, they are wearing them for all the time wear.

It's the same vintage pattern that I used to make this dress  (which Audra wore a lot and Anna-Kate wears now).  All of the fabric was thrifted or gifted, so this Christmas present was practically free.  I hope she loves it!"},

{"title": "Our sitter", "date": null, "text": "Adrian had his very first babysitting experience.  Audra had an appointment bright and early, so I asked Adrian to care for Anna-Kate.  He was very worried how he was going to manage to entertain a puppy and a little sister, but decided (with trepidation) to try. (He wasn't truly alone, his dad was upstairs sleeping). Clearly, Adrian not only managed, but did well.  I came home after an hour and twenty minutes to this:Once we returned home, he announced he needed a break and retreated to his room. I might just call on him again for another babysitting job.Justin and I realized that the kids hadn't been out of the house for nearly 2 weeks.  He brought them for a McDonalds cone just to do something. They do not complain at all about being home and I think a lot of that is because of our critters. The girls spend a ton of time with the animals, which frees up time for Adrian to draw without interruptions! All three kids take such good care of all the animals daily.  Copper is growing so fast!(For the record, this was her idea. Copper is so good that he is hardly ever in there.)Today's post comes along with a story. For years we had a swingset out back, which the kids did enjoy.  However, in the heat of summer, it was in direct sun with no shade for any reprieve.  They didn't go out there much when it was hot.  In the winter the way the snow drifts, it was hard to get to it with a lot of snow.  It didn't get used much in the winter either. We received it second hand from a friend and had been reinforcing it and replacing boards steadily trying to get it to last one more year.  When we were in Florida a few years ago, it blew over and was too broken to be worth it to fix. Here's a pic below, with little Audra swinging, wearing an apron I made her.Believe it or not, I somehow found a 'swingset in the box' kit at the thrift store for $15, all the hardware and swings included, just add the wood. This project has been on our to do list for a few years and I struggled thinking where we should put it. I knew I wanted it to be on the north side of a tree for summer shade but I also wanted it to be visible from the kitchen.  I dreamed a little dream a few years back when this maple self seeded. I trimmed around it, added manure and spent hours after hours removing the multiflora rose from this site (and have scars to prove it). I said \"Someday this could be the shade tree I was hoping for.\"  Well, look at my tree below!  Coddled and tended by me, finally taking off to be the shade for their swingset. I can see them while I hang my laundry. I can see them from my kitchen sink. I can see them from the barn.  It's close enough that it's not hard to get to. It's right by the barn for chicken fun. Many thanks to my husband and his friend for making this happen!They are so happy!I think we might try to put some woodchips or something down next summer, but for now, they are enjoying it as is."},

I'm going to try to cook a bag down to sauce once a week on the woodstove for a bit.  In this picture below was just ONE bag of the several I have.   Nothing like summer tomatoes when there's snow on the ground!  Eggplant parm was today, with our summer tomatoes."},

I've always been committed to rescue dogs, so everytime I considered adopting from a breeder, I reconsidered.  Somehow we have been blessed to adopt this sweet rescue (many thanks to Lish and Amanda).  He's our third rescue (the late Kammie was from Alabama, Holly is from Arkansas and this puppy from Mississippi).  We cannot figure out what to call him, but we have already figured out we love him. My husband took a long weekend so all five of us can be together for four days.  Kids are excited beyond believe.  Holly (lab) loves him.

Thankfully I got out there and cleared right away, as I got a call from our arbor man hookup.  I feed him and he delivers woodchips.  Such a great barter. He dumped this pile right on my garden.  This is year four of a Back to Eden permaculture garden, and I dare say I'm never going back to tilling.  Time to spread some wood chips and there's garlic and parsnips that I'm going to plant!"},

(Plus a couple dozen or so that are either missing in our house or on loan to friends or have been returned to the library or we read on the kindle). This doesn't count their daily independent reading selections, poetry, or all the pictures books we read (which we read picture books everyday for at least a half hour in addition to all this). Almost all I read aloud, but some were done partially or all on audio and a few were \"family book clubs\" (we each took a turn reading and then talked about).This is what (mostly) media free looks like. This is the joy of homeschooling using literature. They beg for book time. My favorite time of the day is reading to them too.  I can't help but smile looking at all the hours well spent on these books together."},

You definitely prefer it when we are all home, home, home. You don't have any issue at all with going less places due to the pandemic. In fact, I think you would be happy if we just continued to be at home indefinitely. You are a rule follower. You like to know the plan. You like all your ducks in a row.  And if the plan stinks in your eyes, you always know the 'best' way to do things.  You can't be in charge now, but you will be a leader someday. You're usually all business, but sometimes there is some humor that creeps in.How you can eat!  Adult like portions and then ask for more! You love soups, stews, homemade bread, fruity desserts, anything!  Except you think eggs are best in a cake, you loathe scrambled or fried eggs.You love swimming and riding your bike. A morning isn't complete without a morning walk in your eyes.Your artistic ability is more and more impressing each year. You have been working on trucks from different perspectives lately. Lots of 3D art with loads of detail. You have a hot and cold relationship with your sisters. Either you're super flexible and participate in all their 'old fashioned' ideas. Or you want to be alone.You've never met a stranger. You are super social and can talk and entertain folks of all different ages. You know what every single person we know drives.  Color, makes and models. You pay very close attention to detail. You remember past conversations with people and will bring up facts you remember from long ago.  You still love tractors and trucks.  Still.  We're getting you the same things we got for your birthday when you were 2 and each year after. Tractors and trucks.  On repeat. Adrian, you are inquisitive, a helper and kind.  I'm very thankful we had our time together with you as our first born, thankful for the last decade together.

Our skin is sun kissed, our swimming muscles are strong and I totally counted river dips as baths more often than I should have.  I don't think my hair ever dried the whole month.  I'd like to say that our time at camp was glorious, like the last few years when we'd swim, read, craft and repeat.  This time, although there were some really good parts and I got to see some people we love, the single parenting was not easy. I don't know why it was different this time, but it wasn't an easy going and relaxing time like I was looking forward to. I feel as though I did character development the entire time.  And throw in some heartache in there too. It's so hard looking back and not knowing what I'd do differently, but I suppose it doesn't matter, for I cannot change the past.  I really missed blogging in this space, it always helps me find the bright lights and I really appreciate the encouragement I get from readers.   Anyway, we're home and I am determined to get our transition home off to a good start. I told my husband I want to clean and organize and purge.  I usually get organized when my kids are at summer camp, but camps didn't happen this year.  Our house is in such disarray. We school year round, but we're on a little break while I organize. I was listening to a podcast today and it talked about parents of children who attend school outside of the home being busy gathering the supplies needed for school. The podcaster talked about how when homeschooling, the home is the classroom and usually all the supplies are already handy. She talked about instead of gathering supplies, to set the home up to run smoothly so schooling time can be undistracted.  That's just what I was thinking, although my thoughts are more like hail coming in the summer months instead of an eloquently worded message of encouragement.  And so, I clean, purge, organize and rearrange.My girls didn't take long to get into their old fashioned apparel.  A whole month living in 2020 is not their usual!  Thankful for my Back to Eden garden, which held up really well with minimal tending. And Adrian and my husband are busy whipping up quick projects to help me organize. This week I'll be posting some highs of our trip. I think doing so will be just what I need to keep my brain focused on the good."},

{"title": "Making it through", "date": null, "text": "The hardest day of my year is always the day before.Let me go back four years.  I was visiting my dad and was wishing I didn't have to return after a week.  I thought about my vacation bank from work. It was plenty full. I ended up deciding to use that time and stay another week.  The next year, I saved my vacation time from work the entire year and stayed two weeks.  After that, I had an opportunity at my job to forfeit any benefits to have the flexibility to take even more time at camp.  Last year we stayed three weeks at camp.  This year we're staying a solid month. (We being the kids and me. My husband stays back and works, thank you, Justin).While we are there, it's a good, good thing. It's just my littles and me the majority of the time.  We go for a morning walk. We swim. We read. We paint and draw.  We go for boat rides. We keep nature journals.  We see family.  We relax.  There is no internet, no phone.  No distractions. I keep meals so incredibly simple. It's the most peaceful time out of the whole year.  The kids cannot wait. It's the highlight of their year.But the day before all this?  SO hard.  To pack what we need for school, recreation and necessities for a month, PLUS to get the barn, yard, house, animals, gardens in 'good to go' status, WHILE managing kids who are SO excited that they cannot find anything functional to do and they are either fighting or trying to help in a way that is not very helpful at all, AND deal with my emotions (I always cry leaving my beloved gardens and farmhouse).  The day before was today. And it was hard. I just put the kids in bed and I was thinking, did I even smile today?  Did I enjoy any of it?  Did I just bark orders and referee?  I am certain I was not at my best.Just as I was finding myself spiraling down 'I'm a failure' lane, I spotted drawings my kids left for me.The first is Adrian's. He drew me (in my glasses) with my wheelbarrow.  I had the dog following me and my shovel.  I was out to mulch the gardens, he said.  He drew me smiling. The next is Audra's.  She drew me laying in my hammock under the maple tree.  I was reading to the big kids, who were in their lawn chairs drawing. THere's a cat on the porch.  She drew me smiling. Anna-Kate keeps drawing me boyfriends. I know I smile at those.Noticing their drawings brought me right to tears.  Even though my day was not the easiest, when they go to think about the day, they think of the times I was smiling.  My view of myself is that I'm never measuring up.  Their view of me is the opposite. My mind may be going at a speed that is too rapid for my liking, my to do list is way too long, the hours I have been sleeping have been way too few, but it will be worth it. This time tomorrow night, I shall be exhaling here, and I cannot wait."},

Pair that with having no family local and a husband who works a lot, I'm almost always flying solo with the crew. Usually our summer for the kids is filled with camps and activities.  Each week from when public schools are out until August, we are running kids here and there.  While some of the summer activities I am present at, there are also many that my kids are dropped off at. Dropping off the kids isn't something we typically do during the year since I help run most of their activities throughout the year.  The July drop offs feel like a real treat not only to the kids, but this weary mama too. But there are no places to be dropped off at.  I can't even remember how many weeks? months? since I've been alone for a spell. There are moments lately when I wish I could find a quiet space where no one would find me, like a cat.I'm trying to find ways to give myself  a little break at home. The kids took a cardboard challenge through 4-H and got along for a good portion of the day creating.  And I got them little surprise treasures, which isn't something that I do except for birthdays/holidays. That inspired a bit of uninterrupted time, too.But the truth of the matter is anything I try to do to get a bit of space is only a temporary fix. I don't really need my own space, I need a different headspace. A change of mindset. Changing those \"I'm struggling\" thoughts that creep into my mind to \"I can do this.\" I need to nip the negativity in the bud before it starts overtaking my brain. Positive thoughts will give way to more positive thoughts. With a change in of mindset, I can and will feel encouraged.  I know I can tackle whatever is in my path, I just need to keep my eyes on what's important and what matters."},

We record in our nature journal almost daily over the summer.  The live animals keep coming in.  We raised a bunch of tadpoles this spring.  We now have black swallowtail caterpillars inside.  Watching the changes of a black swallowtail is something new for us (we mostly have done monarchs). This was really cool.  Audra found a spider laying eggs on a maple leaf.  We brought that in and put in a jar.  She laid the rest of her eggs, covered them and the spiders have hatched and are growing. We just released them in the field.Summer in Maine, there are so many things to explore outside.  Love my miniature scientists."},

You have more spunk than anyone I know. Everything with you is an adventure. You are hilarious. The stuff you say, your vocabulary, your ideas. You keep us in stitches.  You spend most of your life moving, cartwheeling, biking fast, swimming underwater, being upside down or toting an animal around with you. You have much more energy than your parents. You are always up for an adventure. Things you hate:  Waiting. Things that are boring. Tidying. Anything you feel the effort isn't worth it. Being alone. Certainly keeps life interesting!You love books. You will always stop everything to listen to me read to you, to read yourself or to listen to an audio book. You also love crafts. Dressing up old fashioned. But most of all, you really love your animals. One really great quality about you is you don't worry about a thing.  You don't really care about anything tangible.  You could lose all your money and that would be fine.  You could have nothing but the same outfit to wear on repeat. That would be fine. You could permanently lose one shoe, but have the other. That would be fine.  You typically live in the moment and are happy with whatever is present. You love people, family, siblings. You're a talker. Love to be around people. Love your friends. Love to write, especially in cursive.  Spelling things correctly is a waste of time in your book, but your creative spelling gets a smile out of us.  You are incredibly generous. We know the sure way to get your face to light up with delight.  Compliments. You radiate when you hear someone pour on the love.  Audra, I think you are a mighty special girl and I am so thankful for the spunk you bring to our life.  I forgot to ask you the typical questions I ask every year about your future (favorites, what you want to be when you grow up, etc). Check back later, I will be sure to post them."},

We end up homeschooling here mostly, so this is where all our homeschool piles end up.  I cannot even tell you how many times I've talked about creating my dream kitchen and how many times I've grumbled about this space.. (See what it was like when we moved in). Over the years we've dabbled with some paint, rustoleum and tiny upgrades. My favorite of which being my wood cookstove addition.Of course each appliance has broke in succession.  I got the range of my dreams. I love this work horse.We've been here nearly 8 years and my husband and I were enthusiastically talking about my long list of upgrades that I've dreamed about over the years and all those pinterest ideas.  But then I think about all the things we could do and was thinking that I don't really want to do all I thought I wanted to do in this space. Is it a show kitchen? No.  It's not perfect, it's not magazine worthy, but it's functional for us. After 8 years of thinking, I think all I want to do now is install my vintage cast iron sink. get some new countertops and some new flooring.  Maybe someday we'll do all my other ideas, but for now, I've grown more content with the way things are. I'm even used to the washer and dryer being there, after complaining about it for many years. I need to find my way to contentedness more often. It's a good place to be."},

Now there's an orchard, a blueberry patch, raspberry hedge, strawberry patch, asparagus patch, lots of rhubarb, a 40x40 garden (majority of it grown from seeds I've saved over the years) and some raised beds. I've got stains, scrapes, tan lines, dirt under my fingernails, barn boots, a messy bun and 3 kids following me around who can identify weeds, grow their own food, forage for wild edibles and not just survive, but thrive during a pandemic and beyond. I've never been and never will be a fancy girl, rugged is and always will be my style. Perhaps rugged can be the 'in style' during a pandemic?  Hard to believe most of this I started from seed, most of the seeds I have saved over the year.  This garden cost next to nothing! Working towards a Back to Eden garden But also doing some Ruth Stout method. Thankful for volunteers in the compost. Thinking I need another patch. Best I ever took care of my blueberries. 7 years ago, this was field. I even started to weed my raspberries this year. I grew most of this. I grew all of this. Homemade buns, homemade veggies burgers, some homegrown lettuce too.So thankful for the bounty from my backyard."},

The couch is long gone, but the size and fluffiness of these pillows has worked perfect on our daybed.  Only the number of stains really bothered me.  Beyond bleaching it out, I decided to make new ones.But then I had a little flashback to my high school days and rit dye.  I figured it wouldn't hurt to try to dye them. An overnight soak and they look brand new! (I also dyed the curtains in the girls' room that were a bit sun bleached). Now I want to make some quilted pillows to add in, which I will probably get to in the next decade. Anyway, the new color makes me happy.

{"title": "Dreams coming true.", "date": null, "text": "This picture is so much to me. It looks like an ordinary picture, but there's so much behind it.  We bought this homestead on Halloween in 2012.  Adrian had just turned 2, Audra was 3 months. What a crazy, crazy time that was.  I had just gone back to work from maternity leave, opposite shifts from my husband. My husband had all this mandatory overtime and was working near 60 hours a week.  Then we bought this house. Neither of the kids slept at the same time.  I remember getting one to sleep and I'd try to pack the car with just one asleep. Then when they'd wake up, I'd shuffle to the other house (1/2 mile away), feed them both and try to pack the car during the next kid's nap.  I can't remember how many hours I was working. Three or four days, I think.  It was so exhausting. I cried so much.  I remember when my dad came to visit for Thanksgiving, he spent so much time taking our stuff from one house and depositing it in the garage of our farmhouse.  I cried and cried. He was so helpful.   Then once we were settling in, everything broke. EVERYTHING. In both houses.  The washing machine broke at our old house.  Then within the same week the washing machine broke at the farmhouse. I was a cloth diapering mama with no washing machine (thankful for kind neighbors and rapid delivery).  Then the dishwasher broke at the old house, but worked at the new house.  I ended up bringing laundry baskets of dishes to the farmhouse to wash.  But all of our food was still at the old house. The water pump broke at the farmhouse, during a long weekend (hello emergency service fee).  We still owned the other house, were paying two mortgages, and eating rice and beans. Then the furnace at the old house broke.  Months later the furnace at the farmhouse broke.  I hardly remember that first year.  Having two kids under the age of two, half settled, everything breaking, trying to work, functioning mostly as a single parent with being opposite shifts, moving, two mortgages....I could go on and on.  But I also was so so so happy, living in my dream house with my two kids and husband, chickens, a garden. Oh memory lane...Head to Mother's day (2013) and I told my husband what I really wanted was fruit trees.   Historically he has not been the gardening type, so I'm sure he was thinking that it was a waste of money, we barely had time at home together, one more thing, etc.  I don't really remember what he said, but I distinctly remember what I said.  \"I know you think I'm crazy, but years from now, we will be happy we did. Years from now when life is not so crazy, they will be established and providing fruit. We'll be so thankful.  Someday our kids will sit under these apple trees and play and we'll look back and think how glad we are that we started an orchard first thing.\"The other day, I looked outside my kitchen window and saw in our very very sunny backyard that our kids found shade.  Shade none other than the very apple trees I planted 7 years ago. Shade under an apple tree that had more flowers and growing apples than ever before. That someday I dreamed about is today.  I dreamed of apple trees providing for us a harvest. I dreamed of an orchard providing some shade for my littles to play.  And here I am, experiencing the dream I dreamed. My bucket is filled to the brim with thankfulness.Here's our orchard in 2013 (with only two kids and our late dog, Kammie) And our 2020 orchard, with twice as many trees now much taller, now with three kids.

I wrote about how I was going to look for and find the joy on Mother's Day.Well, I tried.  It started off great with my first time sleeping in in 10 years, reading books with Anna-Kate in bed whiles the bigs and their dad made me breakfast in bed (which I haven't had since slumber parties at my grams when I was a kid!).  The kids made lovely cards and homemade posters were plastered all over the kitchen. Plus I have up the special Mother's Day cards from my aunt up (thank you!). It started out so good. I even got a long dreamed about Mother's Day gift for a steal from facebook marketplace. To me, from me, vintage old high back kitchen sink love.  It's going to clean up nicely. Hope to get it installed this decade.Then it went downhill fast. Looking back, I cannot even think of the how or whys, but it was rough. I think it was probably my hardest day of motherhood ever. I somehow stayed remarkably patient, am thankful for my husband's help, but ended up with a pounding headache.  And a sleep number bed with a broken pump.  Felt like that last one was a 'hit her while she's down' moment. I cried that day. A lot.I'm blown away from what happened next. Everything changed. In came the messages rolling in of support, of prayers and offers to help. My tears of thankfulness began flowing when were showered with delicious food and gifts (Thank you Karlene, best chicken pot pie EVER). The milkman gave us three extra quarts of milk and said that we made him smile (Thank you Jimmy!).The day was really starting to turn around!  Only the bread I meant to have ready for Karlene and the milkman didn't rise enough, so it wasn't done in time.  I put some out front to sell it instead (for we both have been mostly without work). I had Emailed my regular buyers that fresh bread was out there.  A gust of wind came and blew all my hard work tumbling across the driveway.  Had to Email them back to say 'nevermind, bread has been blown away'. So disappointing, but I was determined to not it get me down.Fast forward to today, I received a surprise gift from long time bread customers (who I have only met once!).  He said he made it from odds and ends so my bread no longer blows away. I cannot even tell you how special this is! (Thank you, neighbors!)Know what Adrian said?

{"title": "Reading", "date": null, "text": "If you've been around these parts long enough, you know I am a homeschooling mom and book lover, raising my kids mostly media free.  If you've visited here before, it's easy to see that I am an advocate of raising kids surrounded with books. (And I take many pictures of my kids caught reading, this time my baby with her daddy. Melt my heart!)I'm a big fan of the advocacy to read to the littles.  In Maine, we have a program called Raising Readers that gives parents an entire bag of books to keep in the hospital and a quality hardcover at well visits. I absolutely love our library, library programs and story hours. I have been to most of the libraries in the county. I'm a fan of Dolly Parton's goals with her imagination library. I love little free libraries. Book sales. Used book stores.  Online shopping for books.  Books. Books. Books. I love them.At least where I live, reading to the littles is encouraged greatly, which I'm thrilled about.  The next trend, however, I'm not entirely loving.  We read to kids regularly until they get enough skills to read on their own.  Then we encourage/recommend/require them to begin reading to themselves for \"at least twenty minutes a day\".  I hear often from friends how their kids 'hate' their 20 minute reading and how sad it is that they have a kid who hates to read. Now, I'm all for teaching kids to read on their own and encouraging them to read independently, but I recommend this independent reading to be in addition to shared reading with an adult, not instead of it.The benefits of reading to/reading with your older kids are many. When kids start to learn to read, their skills aren't fluent enough to read to match their ability to understand.  It can be discouraging and less interesting to be stuck in those early readers. When reading is an assignment, the joy sometimes can lessen.  On the flip side, reading to your kids, even when they are independent readers, is great bonding time as you experience the joy of the adventure the story brings together.  Sometimes as kids get older, they may be less interested in sharing a story or chapter book with their parent, but are there other things you can read together?  Poetry?  Riddles? Jokes? Books about a shared hobby?  Cookbooks?  Current events? Or perhaps you can read the same text on your own and discuss together at designated times, like a book club or a Bible study.We all get busy, distracted and time flies before we even know it. I believe the power of a good shared book helps my family slow down and enjoy our time together.If you find yourself schooling your littles at home right now, I highly recommend finding time to dig into a good book together daily. Doesn't need to be a long period of time, just a tiny bit of time daily. A few pages. A chapter.  If you need recommendations on what to pick, I can help out. This time at home together is a good time to start new family traditions. I guarantee you won't regret the habit of reading together.If you a parent, what have you been reading with your family lately? Or what did you enjoy reading to your littles back in the day?  We've been really enjoying the Dimwood Forest series by Avi lately. 2nd time through it, just as joyful as the first.My other homeschool posts (click to read):Homeschooling, a wee bit of adviceSchool at home #2#3 Choosing activities#4 Schedules# 5 Lookback#6 HistoryHomeschool PEHOmeschool science"},

Am I here, there and everywhere? No. I'm home.  I'm so confused, my brain is in a haze and do I really know the last time I showered or brushed my hair?  (The answer is no.) I watch the news, read the updates then my shoulders get tense.  I have a long list of things that I always said that I would do if I had time at home. I finally have time at home, but in any spare moment I get, I'm here: My sewing machine has been buzzing for weeks making masks. I don't really mind doing them to help out friends and relations and whoever else needs one, but how are we here?  It wasn't that long ago that life was normal. And how is it my two year old comes up to me and says \"You making more masks for the virus, mama?\" My 2 year old talks about the virus as if it's a common thing to talk about it. How is it that we are here? And when are we going to get out of here? If I could get all this jabber out of my head and get out of my own way, there's much beauty about this stay at home thing.  Our washer broke and the local handyman came to help us out.  The picture of his 1948 Ford hanging in our driveway is just perfection. Things are growing here.Our family has expanded by four legs (but no warts yet). They insist it's a girl and her name is 'Ellie\".

Nothing to worry about at all. May I be that sort of mama. May I be the mama who catches my littles no matter what, even when the catch seems unlikely. May I be that type of mama who doesn't worry in the middle of this chaos we are living in. Even if the world crashes down, may I be their strong and steady, helping them steer through this fog, with confidence we will be on the other side soon.

I notice left and right how folks are helping one another along on facebook groups too. People are asking, receiving and getting blessed. I've been trying to be a giver as much as possible. Our granite steps have become the pickup location for all sorts of things!  The theme items that have been shared the most from our home include toys, fabric, eggs, yeast, homemade fabric masks and lots and lots of BOOKS!  I've become an actual lending library and I absolutely love it! Plus we have our \"Little Free Library\" out front. When I give, I never expect anything in return, but I have been blessed by hand written notes and gifts in return. I'm just so impressed on how much we are all helping one another!  I anticipate I will be leaving plants out front for perennial pickup in the near future too. Today, my neighbors invited my kids over to their front yard to find eggs. My kids were delighted! (Strict no contact.  Wave from the barn type interactions.

The Milkman has been leaving chocolate milks for them. We try to leave little notes and gifts for them. It's so weird that this is how we greet and talk to anyone who stops by to pick something up or drop something off, but we are thankful and encouraged how much we can still do for others and how much others have done for us, even though we are going no where but home, home home.  My challenge to myself this week is what else can I do from home to be a helper? Home sweet home, the obligatory backyard Easter photo, the girls in Mama mades, celebrating Easter, thankful He is Risen. ["},

Possibly.I'm going to take a minute to encourage you to stop those thoughts.  Our minds have a tendency to race, worry, stress about the future and we have a tendency to feel frustration, guilt, defeat about the past.  It's so easy for our minds to be rushing and not at rest.I'm going to encourage you to take a pause at some point in your day and reflect on the good.  Even a very terrible day likely has at least an ounce of good. All this fretting will quickly empty our cup. It's important to fill it back up again with those celebrations, as they help us remember what really matters.The first bit of good is you are still there and you accomplished what felt impossible. I've been a homeschooling mom for years now and cannot imagine how stressful a shift to homeschooling must be all of a sudden. But you did it.The other gems, what are they from your day/week?I'll give you mine.First part of the day, I was greeted by my Audra (age 7 1/2) with a thank you. She said she knows I'm a had working mama and she is thankful for me.We enjoyed a long walk together before the rain was really bad and threw a bunch of rocks in the stream.Kids cooperated and stayed focused for their individual work.Our book time ended with \"More, more, please more!\" before lunch.No time outs today.I kept (mostly) calm.Homemade turkey soup rfor lunch.We played \"Uno\" as a family after lunch.  Anna-Kate (our little clown, pictured above, age 2 1/2) was on my husband's \"team\". They never forgot to say \"Uno\" as every card they played, she affirmed \"NUNO\" each time.I snuck in a wee bit of sewing.Adrian (age 9 1/2) said at the last part of the day today \"Mama, today was a really good homeschooling day.\"Were there hard moments int here? Absolutely.  But those I will not think about again, I'll just think of the good.  Somedays there will be a list of good like I was able to above. Somedays it might just be \"We had food for lunch\".  Point is, look for the good.What was the good in your day today? Write it down. Share it with a friend. Share it with me. Let's not forget to celebrate the joy within our day, today and everyday.My other homeschool posts:Homeschooling, a wee bit of adviceSchool at home #2#3 Choosing activities#4 Schedules"},
{"title": "School at home #4:  Schedules", "date": null, "text": "All of you new homeschoolers are on my heart lately.  I wanted to write a little bit today about schedules.  I see a lot of schedules floating around in which every hour of typical school day is scheduled with parent led activities for a homeschool day. Basically, these types of homeschool days have 9am-3pm scheduled.Now, if you are finding this is working beautifully for your family, carry on!  You have found your groove and are off to great things!However, if you are one of those who is overwhelmed and exhausted at the end of the day, it's you who I want to talk to today.Can I let you in on a secret?  Schooling at home does not need to mirror a typical public school day. I've been homeschooling for many years and I have tried a bit of everything for schedule. I can tell you this, to schedule our homeschool with an every hour activity between 9-3 would lead to homeschool burnout for me and likely frustrations coming from my kids. If you are feeling the same, you are not alone.Can I let you in on another secret? The majority of homeschooling families I know do not schedule their homeschool day like a public school day.  What works for a school with a class full of children isn't necessarily what works best for families.The great thing about homeschooling is you can do what works for you. You can do what works for your children. You can do what works for your family.  It's flexible.  Flexibility is a beautiful thing.I've always been a working and homeschooling mom, which has required that flexibility that I talk about. I've done a bit of everything. I started with early morning lessons, break while I work, followed up with afternoon and evening lessons. I've done a 3 day a week schedule year round with a couple vacations thrown in to get enough days in the early years. I then reduced my work hours and did a 4 day a week homeschool schedule, year round. Saturdays have regularly been homeschool days and we always do some homeschool days in the summer (the very best time for hands on science is summer!).  Long and short of it, school does not need to be a 9-3 if you don't want it to be.Furthermore, when you are doing your lessons with just a couple of students, things can be accomplished faster. You may not need the entire day for focused formal learning.Currently, my work is shut down and I am home with my children full time for the near future. What will our days look like?  They will look like our favorite way to do school.  What is our favorite way to do school?  Here's the schedule that we all love best. (Times are approximate, we don't go by the clock).Morning chores and outside. Breakfast with our audiobook.9ish the start of our morning lessons.  Each child grabs the pile of what they know they ought to do and they get to work. I grab my pile of readings I will lead them in. We spend about 20 minutes per subject. The kids know they must focus and give full attention, for they know that full attention and accomplishing their pile means an afternoon to look forward to.12ish Lunch12:30 until dinner: Outside (I aim for minimum of 3 hours a day outside) and any of the following: Nature Walks, Special projects led by me, Personal hobbies, Play. (Field trips when we're not isolating ourselves).5:30 dinner followed by chores7:00-8:30 family read alouds, followed by quiet independent reading.While of course at the end of the day I am sometimes tired, but not the type of tired that I am feeling burnt out and dread the next day.  This schedule to us is sustainable, which is what we need to maintain sanity and homeschool. Our schedule may or may not work for you.  That's okay. The trick is to find what works for YOUR family. It's okay to create what works for you.My other homeschool posts:Homeschooling, a wee bit of adviceSchool at home #2#3 Choosing activities"},
{"title": "School at home #3", "date": null, "text": "There are SO many great ideas, activities, video clips, tutorials, etc. out there right now. New ones every moment!  I find myself enthusiastic about so many of them! In the middle of my bookmarking and list making, I started to feel overwhelmed with the sheer volume of ideas.  Even though there are a million good things to do online, I don't need to do them all. Today, I shut the computer. We made muffins. We read many books. We took a long walk in the misty rain. We did some seed starting. The internet is grand, but it's not the most important.  When I look back on our day today, the parts we connected best of all had nothing to do with screens. Although I admire and encourage those who organize and plan great activities, I don't need to pressure myself to keep up.  Sometimes just being available for non scripted dialogue leads to the best lessons. Homeschooling, a wee bit of adviceSchool at home #2"},
{"title": "School from Home #2", "date": null, "text": "To my friends who just survived their first day of schooling at home (day one click here), I bring you another day of encouragement. This is largely spurred by Emails and questions I'm receiving (If you have something specific you'd like me to address, I'll try my best to answer in another blog post).  It's also the same encouragement I give myself, for although I have been homeschooling for years, I am still a work in progress.  Perhaps it will be useful to you.1) You did it.You made it through. You didn't think you could, but you did it.  Was it perfect? Probably not.  And that's okay. But you did the best you could, and because of that, feel accomplished.  It is NOT easy to dive into this with limited time to think/prepare.  Feel encouraged, you did it.2) Day 2 will be better.No day is flawless.  Day 2 is a new chance.  Now you know what went well and what didn't.  What will you change about tomorrow? Now that you know what was tricky, you have a chance to improve.  These struggles are opportunities for connecting with your kids. This is where character development happens.  First thing day two, talk with them about what happened day one. Get a plan together on how today will be different from yesterday. Write it down.  Commit to working together to make day two different. I once had a professor say \"If you do nothing between one negative behavior episode and the next behavior episode, how can those negative behaviors be expected to change?\" These stumbles are great opportunities to help them grow their character.3) Do everyday.Read everyday.  Read to them, regardless of age.Go outside everyday.  Go out there with them.When you get stuck, it's okay to stop and change it up. Reading something you mutually enjoy or going outside together are great resets. We are currently enjoying the Poppy and Ragweed series as our family read aloud. On our nature walk today we followed a porcupine until he climbed up a tree.  We kept our dog at bay, thankfully.  What are you reading together? Did you have any memorable experiences outside today?4)You are capable.You made it through today, you have a fresh start day two. What a gift it is to have this time with your students. They will remember that you showed up and gave it your best.  You are more than capable. Onward to day two, I am cheering for you!  (Day one click here)"},
{"title": "Home Education, a wee bit of advice ", "date": null, "text": "Tomorrow many of my friends will find themselves thrusted into a role they didn't sign up for as their kids' home educator. I'm certainly not an expert homeschooler, but have some experience having homeschooled my kids for all their schooling thus far (my oldest is just about finished with third grade).Here's a bit of advice from me. It's the same sort of self talk I give myself when needed. Perhaps you may find it useful.1) You are enough. I know you may feel like you're not adequately planned or prepared or ready. You may not feel equipped. You may feel frustrated that you did not sign up for this. Put all those worries aside.  You have what it takes to do a good job because you love these kids so much that you are willing to give it your best. You are enough.2) Atmosphere is important.It matters less how much you accomplish in a day, it matters more how you accomplish it.  Think less about the end goal. Think more about the process of discovering, enjoying and connecting with one another.  If not everything gets done today, that's okay. There is tomorrow. Keeping the atmosphere of the home peaceful is a more important than accomplishing the list.3) Do everyday.Read everyday.  Read to the them, regardless of their age.Go outside everyday.  Explore with them, regardless of their age. Consistently doing these two things helps establish a connection with one another and joy in learning. It often makes it more likely that other things on the list will be checked off with greater ease as well.4) Give yourself grace.This whole homeschooling thing is new to everyone. It may go well at some moments and others it may not. One step at a time. Give yourself grace.  These weeks of schooling at home will be forever memorable to your children. Keep working at making this experience a time together you will both forever treasure. You can do this!"},

You still almost always have something tractor related you are wearing. This hasn't changed one bit. Your favorite hobby is still cutting tractors out of magazines.You remember everything.  You collect books, enjoy reading them and love to be read to.  You enjoy 'working' around the farm. You eat everything and anything, in big quantities. You finish it all and say you are still hungry.  You enjoy shoveling, swimming, biking and nature walks.  Your favorite pets are our dog (Holly) and Zoom the cat (who often sleeps with you).  You love routine and order and predictability.  You find our family too busy and you'd like to stay home more. You bring such a stable presence to our family.  We can't imagine where we would be without you to keep us on track.

Your loving daughter, Audra. PS. You are the best mom. I hope you have the best birthday ever.\"So it happened, I celebrated my 39th.  It started with a morning walk before sunup, pancakes for the littles, notes of appreciation, books, and more books. Midmorning I realized I forgot to drink the coffee I brewed.  Coffee with lunch, then a trip to the library, a dip in the pool, a spin through the local thrift shop. Home to find fun birthday mail (thank you!) and make some seafood as a birthday treat. My dear husband called and said he was close to Walmart and I could have whatever I wanted from there for my birthday if I told him what I wanted quickly. I pleaded him to leave the crisco cake there and we'd make a good one the next day. He listened and brought me some yummy dark chocolate home instead, plus guinea pig food. Next, dinner as a family and books before bed. Mostly ordinary, yes, but I find such comfort, beauty and love in our ordinary.Our ordinary wouldn't be complete without wide eyes and a chuckle. Paired with the lovely note above, I received an additional wrapped gift from Audra. The gift contained the exact item she handmade and gave my husband for Christmas.  He unwrapped it just a couple weeks ago, expressed his appreciation for it.  It was unknowingly whisked away from him and regifted to me.  So bad, so sad, dear husband of mine. The homemade potholder is mine now! Living the good life, that's for sure.  Thankful for my 39 years."},

When we are not going places, you create your own adventure at home. Most often your adventures are 'old fashioned' adventures (in period clothing) and you end up at the cracked rock in the woods, pine stream village out back, the secret garden or the hundred acrewood, all landmarks that you have named on our property. You also enjoy traveling via bike on your adventures. Even in the winter. Even taking a bath is an adventure in your entertaining pretend world!While you aren't always eager to try things that look different, you almost always do and then you decide you like it. Eggs are your favorite. You can eat more eggs than a grown man. You also are  a big fan of salads and any crisp, ripe fruit. Your favorite cake is coffee cake. Favorite ice cream is Mint Chip. You love animals and are a true animal whisperer. You love all sorts of crafty things (drawing, crochet, painting, weaving, sewing, needlepoint), gardening and cooking. You like to write and read. You love to be read to and listen to audio books. In fact, we can't go anyplace in the car without you saying \"Can you turn the audiobook on?\" Your favorite Audio Book is Mrs. Piggle Wiggle lately.  You listen to it over and over. The books we've read lately that you love most are Hattie and Hudson, Mandy, Adventures of Lily Lapp and Green Smoke.Although you sometimes need help staying focused, you're a quick learner and catch onto things quickly.  This year you have been fantastic at all extracurricular activities, teachers enjoy having you in class.   You quip the most entertaining quotes and can sputter scripture out with ease.While you keep us on our toes, your daddy and I know that our lives would never be as exciting without you in them.I love you dearly, my Audra Grace!Love, Mama"},

The smell of freshly cleaned stall, the vinegar I'd use to disinfect her udder/teats, the hay, grain, bag balm and sweet milk smells.  I'd sit on my stool, lean my head into the warmth of the cow's belly and get my rhythmic milking going. Swish swish, ping ping, into the milk bucket.  I tried machine milking a number of times and came to conclusion that I'm a hand milker. Nothing like it. Such a great time to think, to plan, to pray, to be still.  No longer am I milking, but we still have the habit of throwing outerwear over our sleepwear and heading out.

I listened to a podcat on parenting. I made a nice dinner for my family.  I took a walk by myself.  I welcomed my babies back home with opened arms as they ran to me for hugs. I truly did miss them. Now after this reset, I am more than ready to tackle my week of kids, kids and more kids. Even though life gets overwhelming at times, I'm really blessed to be living this amazing life.Plenty to read.Plenty to eat Enough to keep us warm and to cook on Handmade woolens and diaper covers drying (hung by the littles) Coffee and my most loyal girl Beautiful to do listsCollections that spark joyA homestead and home filled with so many living thingsAnd reminders here there and everywhere that my feelings of inadequacy are superfluous.  I am more than enough for all this.  I believe just as my Gram used to say, that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. This week is going to be a good one."},

Walking to my first of the day college class, going by the TV in the MUB noticed folks glued to the screen.  Was in a hurry to be on time.

Then we had another professor pop their head in the classroom. \"There's been another hit.\"  The whole department piled into a center classroom where the TV on a moving cart was located and we stared in horror.  Classes were cancelled for the day.  I walked back to my dorm shaking. I changed out of my green 3/4 length sweater, tan pants, tan doc martin sandals into comfy clothes.  We turned on the tiny little TV and were paralyzed watching.  Know where my husband was? (I didn't know him at the time.)   He was ON a plane in BOSTON waiting to take off to visit his Aunt in Tampa, FL. He was wondering what was taking so darn long. They eventually deboarded and he was a lucky one. He got to go home.It's 2019 and I certainly haven't forgotten the horrific feeling of that day. As I stood here on the beach in Ogunquit with just my 2 year old (big kids at their drama club), an impromptu dip, watching her do her favorite thing on the beach (collect seaweed...eww), I became incredibly thankful that day to day I don't feel petrified to go anywhere, as I did after that horrific day.  I'm thankful for the freedom I have because others have sacrificed everything.  Thankful to live in the land of the free and the home of the brave.  Thankful to be an American."},

The same things you have loved your whole life. Tractors. Trucks. Repeat.  Your John Deere collection is immense. You don't care. You want more.You absolutely love having your own money and shopping-both in store and online.  What do you look for when you are shopping?  Tractors. Carhart. Construction. Camouflage. Repeat.You have grown quite fond of biking this year.  And of course you love swimming. You rocked your overnight camping experience. You have a deep love for books and for your artwork.  The details you add to your pictures are exquisite. One of the biggest growths you have made this year is your ability to public speak.  You went from the kid who refused to say anything to a kid who needs no notes and talks well beyond the allotted time. You look at the audience, talk loudly and connect with them. You even crack jokes on stage! It's been so fun watching your confidence soar.One of the things I love about you most is how you relate to other people. You are kind to everyone (except sometimes your sisters drive your nuts, of course). In a nursing home, you can go strike up a conversation with a resident. You relate well with adults. You can talk to kids older than you and the same age as you.  You adapt your play to play with younger kids. You are very helpful with babies.  You have been consistently respectful to your teachers this last year at church, 4-H and homeschool co-op. The person you are becoming makes me very proud. You are expensive to feed.  The other day your dad watched you eat 5 pancakes, a full glass of milk, a plum, an apple, a bowl of yogurt and you were still hungry so I gave you cereal.  That was just breakfast.  You are an adventurous eater (except you loathe scrambled eggs) and will try anything.  You are a big fan of soups, homemade bread, any fruit and your dessert of choice would be a fruity dessert or a fruity ice cream. My most favorite part about you is how much you love me. You are with me when the sun rises and with me when the sun sets and like to spend every minute in between at my hip.  You are STILL upset when I go to work.  We have a huge house, 30 acres and if you had your choice, you'd never leave my side.  In fact, you said that I'm going to homeschool you college so you can stay here with me.  At one point you were afraid to spread your wings. It's not like that now...you are happy to do new things. But you remember your roots vividly and show me how important I am through your love and affection.Adrian, I am so happy to be your mama.

He said he didn't bother to read most of them, but he knew they were special notes from me.  (And I made him read a couple...he can totally read them. He just didn't bother, lol).His head counselor informed us that he has learned a lot over the last week about farming and farm equipment.Adrian couldn't wait to talk about the food.  He said he could eat as much as he wanted there and pick whatever he wanted.  He said he got to have candy cereal with Xs in them for breakfast (Lucky Charms, never had he seen those before, lol) and that he could eat as many sandwiches as he wanted. Apparently there were vegetables available but he skipped those and ate more of the treats instead. (Sigh.)His favorite part was his skill class, which he picked Riflery. He spent his free time there playing tractors which he brought from home and found a group of boys to play with him too.I also asked him what he missed most and is eager to get to at home.  \"Books,\" he said.  He missed getting read to!  His next question was what was our next chapter book.  (He missed homeschooling!

He has no qualms about bringing the trio places alone-from errands to hiking a mountain (which he did both this week). He is super involved in their lives and would do anything for them.Case in point.  Justin was just commenting/laughing about living in a house with all these books. He said \"Twenty years ago, if you would have told me I'd be living in a big farm house without TV, but with piles of books around, I would have laughed aloud.\" Adrian quipped, \"Well, you are just a part of a family who loves books, dad. It's just the way it is.\"Because he loves them so, the kids talked him into reading a couple of chapters of our new copy of Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle aloud to them.  He is not an independent reader. Definitely does not volunteer to read aloud. Graciously tolerates the racket of audio books in the cars when he'd much prefer music.  But if his kids ask him to read, he'll do it.  (Psst....I think they all enjoyed Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle too.) I call him a heluva good dad and we're all thankful for him.

I've had some who have come once or twice and some who have been sewing just about weekly.  Each child has gained skills, and that makes my heart happy.

Mulched the orchard and still in the process of mulching the blueberries. Added some blackberries.-Started a strawberry raised bed an asparagus bed (which the cats have been tearing apart the asparagus. Sigh).-Moved A LOT of manure-Husband helped me screw together a compost in a new location (thank you).-Cleaned out our onion and chive raised bed...which I never did last year at all.-Planted a garden full of everything you can imagine and then some.-Given away A LOT of plants-And I've been working on taking away and managing this overgrown mess.  Believe me, this is WAY better than it was (but I have hopes of continually improving it. On my to do list:-Mulch, mulch, mulch.  And water.-I want to get some wheelbarrows full of pine needles to mulch the blueberries again (They love acidic soil).-The raspberries are a mess.-Someday I'd like to move my elderberries.-I have cherry bushes that I'm nursing inside, hoping to get them strong enough to plant outside.-Weeding. And mulching. And watering.ParsnipsCilantroChivesThis year I also worked VERY hard on the house.  I have always tried to keep up with what the previous owners had planted, but truth to be told, I have no idea what their vision was so it just ends up looking a mess.  I gave myself permission to dig up, move, purge and add.  I mulched for the first time here.  It looks much better! When we first bought this house, there was a maple tree in the middle of this mess of perennials and weeds.  I said \"Someday this will be a fun tree to play under\" and I threw a  ton of cow manure around it. Well, it's a perfect shade tree now!  I gave away all the perennials during the perennial swap and mowed the rest. Now there's a play space in the shade. I dug up HUGE HUGE HUGE barberry bushes. I loathed those things. Each one took an hour. I have more to go, but not this year.  I plan to put little gardens like this instead of those junky barberry. These are all plants I brought from our old house and now have divided. And I actually am coordinated enough that I did annuals this year.  Go me.Enough chicken waterers for planters now!That's a wrap for update 1.  Hours of work into one post.  Progress is progress!  How is YOUR gardening going?"},

Did you know that many nursing homes keep a cabinet of empty flower vases and many love it when folks swing in and fill those vases?  It's so nice to go from an empty dining room to leaving with a fresh bouquet on each table!

Your most favorite is any fruit crisp, but you are always looking for any and all desserts.

{"title": "Re-set", "date": null, "text": "This week was rough.  I'm not sure why, but I could use a do-over.  Since that's not possible, my husband granted me a re-set instead today. I took some time for me. I started a once a week 4 week acrylic class. I got to go all by myself and just be present with other adults. No kids anywhere. It was really quite fun and relaxing. My only job was to create and organize color. The instructor said at the end that it's really great we all got together to paint because it's much better than being alone.  I don't know whose voice it was, but I heard something that sounded like my voice and it came out of my mouth. I heard a tense, disgruntled tone a wee bit too loudly say:  \"I AM NEVER ALONE!\".  Everyone turned to look at me. Oops.  I guess I just said that aloud.  They all laughed. I did too. I'm pretty sure my cheeks turned red. Alone, that's what I needed. After painting class, I was supposed to go grocery shopping, but I instead bought myself a treat and drove to the ocean.  I just sat there in my car in silence, watching the waves and ate it slowly. Alone.  No interruptions. No sharing. No arguing. Peace.  I then spent entirely too much money on groceries but saved a bundle on some great scores at the thrift shop.  It's all about balance, right?  I then came home to children overjoyed to see me, as I was to see them.  Then we had a marvelous afternoon.  Well, with the exception of children biting each other before going up stairs for bed.  Can't win them all, I suppose.Truth of the matter, parenthood is hard.  Really hard sometimes.  These tiny humans come and it just so happens that every bit of mama's body, soul, mind and energy is given to them.  And then what's left? Not much.  I feel my best when I have made time to exercise, read and create in a day.  How often does all that happen? Not enough.  Definitely not enough. Goodness, not enough is not good enough!  Just because it's hard doesn't mean I'm not going to stop trying.  I need to take time to take better care of me. Because I'm worth it.  And you are too. Let's keep on keeping on, together."},

Then I brought my kids to buy Lunchables (which they always wanted, but then decided that they looked gross and would rather have the hot corn chowder for sale in the front of the grocery store...parenting win!).

And of course that was one of many time sensitive hats I was juggling on 3 1/2 hours of sleep. You know the books Caps for Sale by Esphyr Slobodkina? This past week I felt like the peddler with all those caps, with many monkeys keeping me off course but never with the opportunity to fully rest and lose these hats that I've been working so hard to wear.  It's been like all my hats have been teetering to and fro and I'm in a constant state of trying to catch them.The good part about this past week is that reading to my kids and reading to myself were still accomplished.  Those books? Well, they spoke right to my soul.In our family read aloud, this quote popped up. \"We cannot expect to keep our children forever.  Motherhood has great joys, but great sorrows too. We must accept things as they are.\" -Flossie and Bossie by Eva Le Gallienne.Goodness, didn't that quote right there start to turn my mind around.  Sure, moments were stressful, but the joy far surpasses the sorrows.  My brain and calendar are clogged with good things I want to be doing. I was mostly home the whole time my children were sick and when I wasn't, my husband was caring for them. I never worry when he cares for them, he's such a good dad. The fire is warm, the books are aplenty and there's always a pet ready to snuggle.  And the list goes on...That wee bit of text from a children's book reminded me that even when the road gets rocky that an accepting heart calms the internal dialogue.Literary teachings didn't stop there.Today the book that I just finished reading had this text: \"And me? I just sit there, smile, my heart so full I think I'll burst, knowing what a lucky girl I am.\" -Penny From Heaven\" by Jennifer HolmHow can I not read that quote and think about how my cup overflowth?!   Husband. Three kids. Living in my dream home. Homeschooling mama. Pets a plenty. And the list goes on...Remembering the thick split pea fog of one whopper of a week, looking back...what I see is joy for all I have.After that joy filled my heart, I grabbed my camera and took a few pics of the 'right now' of \"Livin' Lipsky\".  We had a market set up with any delicious food we could want for free. At the same time we had a live art show. Plus the sizzle on the woodstove of 'easy and cheaper than take out' Chinese food (thank you Birdseye frozen veggies) We also had a little girl sweeping the floor in her tap shoes.  Tap. Tap.

Counting down the days, planning the celebration, telling everyone you see that it's coming up.  As a \"grown-up\", my own birthday not at all resembles those childhood milestone birthdays.  For some reason, I have a bad habit of seeing these important dates coming up and immediately going to the place of feeling inadequate.  I start mentally listing all the things I have meant to have done or mean to be doing and just haven't. It's unfortunate, truly, that those negative thoughts just sneak in there before I even know it.  And then they just cycle around in my brain before I even realize what I'm thinking. Then my thoughts are monopolized with criticisms.  I need to realize sooner than later that I have the power to stop those encroaching thoughts. I have the power to choose joy.  I have blessings abound and that's the lens I want to and need to use to look at my life.  Much of my birthday was the same old everyday type of thing (right down to the same gifts my kids regularly make to give me, lol)...but my life through that perspective contains such beauty and immeasurable joy.  I'm so thankful for this blog, as life through my camera lens and sorting out my thoughts with words keeps me marching forward with love, joy and peace in my heart.

You are either keeping us in stitches or challenging every ounce of our patience and there is no in between!  You keep us on our toes. You think fast, move fast. By the time we've caught up with you, you've moved on to the next.Unless...there are three things that you will always slow down and focus on.1) Books. How you love to be read to. You can go from 100mph to snuggled up and peacefully anticipating what will happen next. You prefer to have an audio book blaring at you throughout your entire day, especially in the car. Your vocabulary is exquisite. I love when you tell me to make haste or you prefer the dainty variety or whatever else random you say.2) Animals. You are the animal whisperer.  You pretty much don't play with toys, you play with your animals. You create these elaborate schemes and set up these bedrooms, living rooms and castles for them. You snuggle them, talk to them, soothe them, feed them, brush them, take care of them.  All of them.  In a single day, it wouldn't be unusual for you to spend your free time shifting between the dogs, cats, guinea pigs, chickens and goats. 3) Art. You, my girl, are quite the artist. You love to draw. And most giving to boot. The old mail messenger bag that I made years ago is constantly stuffed with your creations you will readily give out to whoever. You tape pictures and notes in random places. You slip them in pockets. You made ~30 miniature hand drawn ornaments just last week and they are now hung from every doorknob, light switch and handle in the kitchen. They are everywhere. But...does your art stop with pencil and paper? Goodness. NO.  Our whole house is decorated with crocheted chains. You paint on wood scraps and hoist them up here and there. You have this fabric scrap blanket that you are hand stitching and it's getting quite big. You love to find holes to mend. You like embroidery. And knot tying.  We find baling twine knotted creations everywhere. You also have quite the knack for cooking. And you're really taking to learning the art of music. A couple years back, I never thought I'd be able to say that you are a good sleeper, but you are, indeed!  You sing yourself to sleep and then rise with the sun. Throughout the day, you are alone pretty much never. You love to have company and to talk. You make friends wherever we go.  We joke that you will live in the city someday and be thriving with the hustle and bustle. You'll probably have lost your shoes, lost your money and lost your keys, but you'll find someone to buy you lunch!Audra Grace, you have more spunk and energy than anyone I know.  I'm so thankful my days include you. Love, MamaHer gifts: Which she is already mass producing potholders."},

Justin does like snacking.  He also got this button he made for him. It has a John Deere tractor he drew in it. And a mug with a train on it.  I suppose Justin must have been dreaming about a mug from Seattle, Washington, lol. From Audra, Justin got the sweatshirt he's wearing, a spatula/flipper thingy (??), a santa lollipop and a picture Audra drew of her heart. They are so good at getting each other gifts too, and they spend most of their money on each other! Audra got Adrian tractors, an airplane, miniature soldiers, books he'd like, camouflage shirt, an orange hunting sweatshirt.  Adrian gave Audra a ceramic horse, Jan Brett books she didn't have, a Northface coat and a sheriff badge (???).  Anna-Kate got snacks, books, a pretty dress and babies from them...which is right on.The \"after\"And Audra writing recipes in the middle of the chaos. Here's there loot.  They are so fortunate to have grandparents and family friends who know them so well and get gifts they truly love. She's still holding on to her cookies!Very thankful for a wonderful Christmas day."},

The chickens eat them as treats. Anna-Kate too (sigh).  A friend told me I should make some corn bags with them ( you know the ones you heat and bring to bed with you) or we need some bags for a cornhole game the kids have been making. We'll save some to plant next year if we so decide. So many uses!  This process has occupied a good amount of their time thus far.  Hopefully we'll have a successful finished broom at some point.This is where I become inspired originally to make brooms-our 2016 visit to Upper Canada Village.

Look how you tip your little head in pics, just as I used to do when I was a kid. You are my mini me!To start with, you are a talker.  Non stop.  You have mama, dada, bubba (brother) and ahwah (Audra). You imitate anything and everything we say and come up with your own 2-3 word sentences all day long. You say things you think are funny and crack yourself up. You love music, dancing, stacking blocks. You love your babies and rock them and tell them \"shh\".  You hate for any of your babies to be dressed and holler OFF OFF OFF if they are clothed. You also love organizing. You bring adults every piece of whatever you find or you love filling buckets. You're most helpful in the garden, collecting seeds and bulbs. Your biggest love is reading books, which you bring us books all the time and tell us \"Readabook\". At nursery, a friend told me you play nicely alone. Well, that NEVER happens at home because your big brother and sister never leave you alone.  In fact, I think your dad and I say \"LEAVE HER ALONE\" more times a day than anything else. You love them, though.  You give oodles of hugs and kisses to all your loved ones. You are always gentle with the animals. Always. They flock to you. However, you're not very gentle with babies younger than you. In nursery, you steal pacifiers and push the new walkers down. Not good, Anna-Kate! You (clearly) are an excellent eater, but still prefer anything colorful.  If we plopped a pile of spinach leaves and a piece of homemade buttered bread on your plate, you'd chuck the boring looking bread and eat all the spinach. All fruits and all vegetables are preferred to anything a bland color, fine with us! It's hard to believe you have only been walking for a few months.  And now you're running. Fast. You grab our hands and tell us \"outside\" frequently. That's your favorite place to be!We're so thankful you have been an easy going and portable baby. You're the perfect addition to our family and we love you oodles.Love, Mama"},

A fantastic vintage one. I remember giving it a whirl with my dad.Onto this vintage bike. I spotted this beauty and asked how much.  They said \"It's taking up too much room, five bucks.\"  Sold. Somehow crammed it in our Subaru. Rod iron baby seat in the back, I need to get Anna-Kate a helmet.  I also think it needs a bicycle basket in the front.  Until then, the kids and I have been having fun biking in the yard together. Five bucks well spent.(And look, I'm finally in a picture, thanks Justin!)"},

However, due to paperwork problems, he wasn't able to come this year (we are still disappointed).  We were blessed with a second week at camp with the change of plans.So, what did we do?  A full two weeks with no phone, no internet and the days with mama bear and her three cubs. We went for daily roll out of bed walks, we read the morning away, spent afternoon time in/on the water as well as painting in our nature journals and we ended our day with family dinners.  My husband got plenty of fishing time in. I tried to go no where.  As a working mama, I am running more than I would like when we are home, vacation certainly provided us with much needed downtime.Because I love to talk books, the outcome of our vacation time:The following Laura Ingalls Wilder books (for the 2nd time)Little House in the Big WoodsLittle House on the PrairieOn the Banks of Plum CreekBy the Shores of Silver LakePlus, new ones to usUnderstood BetseyGreen EmberThornton Burgess books (Blacky the Crow and Old Mother West Wind Whys)Abe (Lincoln) Grows UpAnd I re-read Gone with the Wind. It's just as captivating/upsetting/surprising/interesting as it was the first time I read it 20 years ago.We're back now and with happy memories I'm working to get things organized to get back in gear for our day to day life.  Back in Maine, as I was elbow deep in tomatoes, my husband asked me why I do all I do. Why not just quit all these busy projects, do less and live life like the rest of the world?I took a quick 360 scan-laundry on the line, free ranging roaming chickens, color needing harvest in the gardens, bouquet of flowers on the table, zucchini cake in the oven, tomato sauce simmering, children lost in pretend play, baby at my feet.  I patted the cute fluffy cloth diapered bottom in front of me and asserted that I will just always be busy with my projects, for although lovely vacations make my heart feel full, the hustle bustle of homelife makes my heart even fuller."},

You have plenty of energy and don't need much sleep to recharge. You make friends wherever you go and make folks smile along the way. You're so crafty, clever and such a natural at baking and cooking. You are amazingly athletic, a natural at whatever you try. You are amazing with animals, so gentle and interactive with them.

You love fairy tales, but as you say, definitely NOT Disney fairy tales, but the real ones.  Old writings you love, and you regularly use the advanced vocabulary you hear.You love BLTs, salads, lettuce sandwiches, grazing in the garden and finding edible weeds. You also love eggs. You have eaten up to FIVE in one serving, although usually it's 3-4!  Really you eat anything and everything. For being a tiny little girl, you eat man sized portions. Pretty much the only things you don't like are transitioning from something fun and waiting.  As long as we keep the adventures rolling, you're at your best. Although you test our patience daily, we are forever grateful for your spontaneity, spunk and loving nature. I imagine someday you really will live in the city and wear \"up shoes\".

But, hallelujah.  A month of working on it, it's mostly in.Now, the weeds. Ugh. Weeds.  Can't see those from a distance, so here ya go: Hard to believe that this was field when we moved in 5 1/2 years ago.  There's our orchard, berries, herb beds, rhubarb, main garden.And then on the other side of the barn, we are trying a brand new garden, hoping the squash bugs won't take it over as rapidly as they have in the other garden. Every year, the squash bugs ruin things before plants even have a chance. Thanks to my husband for helping with this.A few happenings:Potatoes still going strong from the seed potatoes I got 5 years ago.  Free potatoes year after year. Kale from seed.  Grew these under the growlights and transplanted. Cilantro I let self seed. We're eating cilantro in everything. I need to keep working on thinning my parsnips.  Look how tall these that I thinned are!  Hope to have one area of parsnips for this fall, the other for next spring. Last year, even with not watering at all, my pepper yield was double thanks to planting in black plastic. Peppers like hot weather, this helps keep those temps up. Also, I figured out a great way to grow peppers indoors.  I planted them in their starter pots and put the starter pot in a store bought plastic garden container. Closed the lid. It was like the peppers had a little greenhouse under teh growlights. Took less time to germinate that way. THis year we planted our tomatoes around feedbags.  Hopefully that will help with moisture retention, and of course the weeds. Last year we had an infant at this time and I pretty much didn't water at all.  This year I bought an automatic shut off, which is life changing.  I set the dial for how long I want it watered and then it shuts off automatically. Life changing!The most food I have grown in this space was 800lbs. of produce.  Curious what this year's harvest will bring.Just this year I was peeking at garden carts online, wanting to take the plunge and purchase one. But, I didn't. Good thing, for I found one for 1/3 the price at a yardsale.  I foresee this cart being useful carrying grain bags, wood, plants and children."},

{"title": "Hannafords Love", "date": null, "text": "I love Hannafords.  For those of you who are not local, it's a grocery store. A couple years back one went in in a location that I drive by on my way home from work. LIFE CHANGING, this popping in quickly to the grocery store.  While Hannafords is a big chain, this particular Hannafords is small and quaint.  It has just what you need. I reminds me of Eddys from my hometown back in the day. Staff are always friendly and helpful.  They regularly ask if you found everything you needed.  Once I did not. They didn't have canning lids. Next time I went in there, they had a display out front of canning stuff.With one other fabulous mom, we have led three months of cooking, food and nutrition classes for our 4-H club.  We decided to end our cooking block with a field trip to the grocery store. I *still* remember touring the grocery store when I was a 4-Her, and trying freshly sliced pineapple with my fellow 4-Hers. Thought it would be fun for our current 4-Hers. The store manager had a reusable bag with a paper hat for the kids.  They were instructed to use their star system to find two healthy things.  Adrian found grapefruit and multigrain sub rolls. Audra found a potato and garlic hummus.  Next they presented the kids with a healthy snack to enjoy in the store. Then they toured the bakery, more of the store and the meat department. Then they GAVE each kid the healthy items they picked. BUT, that's not all!  Our club was then doing some shopping for charity after. Hannafords FILLED a shopping cart with more items to donate to the charity we chose. We didn't ask them to double the kids' efforts, but they did. And now we have subs for dinner, grapefruit for breakfast, hummus for snack and a lot of potato holding.  Audra  just loves her potato and there are so many great things to make with potatoes that she cannot decide.  Perhaps the potato may be our new pet.Hannafords not only for the win, but the ultimate trophy.  I'm proudly a Hannafords girl."},

And then Audra told him how she loves the Blue Fairy and Red Fairy books by Andrew Lang. She wants more old fairy tales, not Disney ones.The owner said, \"We never have kids interested in old books. Pick something, anything you'd like. I'm going to give it to you for free.\"Both kids picked perfectly. She has a big book of original (and likely very dark) fairy tales. And he got a book about a boy growing up on a New England farm. And I got a couple of gems too. We have been loving poetry of all kinds (and Adrian has been composing poetry too for fun!), Famous Explorer stories, Mark Twain, Fairy tales, and Adrian's story about the New England Farmer.  This would be $60+ worth of books. He said $10. I said, take $20.  He said here's you change.  He gave me a $10 bill back.  So $10 for all these books.  I think he knew that we're the type of folks who actually read the books instead of sell them.

I have fond memories of them waking up and meeting me outside when I was hand milking or coming inside in time for bed after a summer sunset, dirty from head to toe. I'm so fortunate that I have panoramic windows in the kitchen so I can see them playing. In those warmer weather months, a seamless outside/inside transition is occurring almost hourly. However, in winter, although we go outside, the time we are outside is usually less. Maybe it's the cold temps or the ice. Maybe it's because it takes an hour just to get all the winter gear on, (okay, maybe not an hour, but a long time) and by the time they are out there they are hungry/thirsty/have to go to the bathroom.  Maybe we just enjoy the fire inside.Long and short of it, regardless of weather, kids NEED to be outside.  Since we have the right gear for them, it is possible for them to be comfortable in just about all elements.  We have found that one short winter outdoor play time is not enough.  We've been helping get that snowgear on again and again in a day, sending our kids out twice, even three times a day. We're aiming for a minimum total of 3 hours a day outside.It tell you, it helps. It helps with focus, learning, cooperation, appetite and sleep. They play better together, are more creative, they are kinder to one another and listen more attentively. They are more regulated, calmer and happier.My husband and I are working on joining in their outside time as much as possible. We had a family walk today tracking turkeys. I cleared the ice out of our driveway with Adrian and Anna-Kate on my back. Justin brought the big kids sledding.  Tomorrow we are planning on ice skating. Regardless of age, we ALL could use some more outside time.Three hours total outside a day regardless of weather for the kids, that's our goal.

You'd never refuse a Snickers. You love to cook and bake, and in fact you are quite natural at it.  No matter how active you are during the day (which is VERY active or VERY VERY active or VERY VERY VERY active), you'll just about always stop for a book.  Picture book, short story, chapter books, audio books.

(Weird? Different? Whatever fits.) I've enjoyed books, working with my hands and learning my entire life. I mass produced potholders and had my chapter books alphabetized as a kid.  I could cook an entire meal for my family at a young age.  I was not afraid of hard work. I got in trouble for reading during class. I'd wear my handmade clothes with pride.  I'd be stitching while waiting for afternoon activities. My friends had first friendship bracelets and scrunches made by me, and then prom dresses and quilts for their dorm rooms.  I never had a hard time fitting in growing up. I had friends who loved me for who I was. When it was time to go to college, I was worried.  I felt different from others. I had no attention span for TV, had hardly seen any movies, was clueless about fashion and didn't even know who the stars even were. In my plight to fit in, I left all my handcrafts at home, hours away from my dorm room.It didn't take me long to realize that I couldn't and really didn't want to pretend to be someone I wasn't.  I went back to being myself, brought my sewing machine back to college, and found friends who embraced me as I was. When I started this blog, the main reason I started it was twofold. I wanted to document my kids' childhood and all that we were up to and I wanted to supply a steady supply of pictures to their grandparents. Once I set up the blog, I discovered that it filled another purpose.  It's a space that I can un-apologetically post the things I love on repeat. In this space, there are plenty of folks who share my homemade/homegrown/slowed down pace of life goals and plenty of folks who do not.  All the folks who read are not \"just like me\".  But all the folks who read have been consistently kind, caring and encouraging of my journey.  It's so nice to have a place where folks join me in whatever random thing I'm working on and give me support and keep me company. For that, I thank you.And 2018? I'm going to keep on keeping on with my homemade/homegrown/slowed down lifestyle. Hoping for more of these 2017 images to creep into 2018.  Thank you, dear readers, for coming along with me on this journey."},

Modern books.  My husband wants me to read more books so we can do what he loves-watch the movie that corresponds with the book.That being said, I also have strong feelings that children do not need to know how to read themselves in those early years. I've felt this way for a long time and am now living my soap box.  In my mind, those early years are to fall in love with books and fall in love with being read to. It's time for the imagination to soar and ideas to be developing. It's not time to make reading 'work'.Of course even with strong convictions, one always hopes their views measure up when it really counts.Age seven, he's a reader now and doing quite fine. Even more, he loves books.  Picture books, chapter books, audio books. All books.My decision to wait until he was ready ended up being a good decision.  Phew.Now it's his turn to read to his sisters.

{"title": "Ramblings", "date": null, "text": "I am in deep, deep, deep into this paleontology project.  Probably over my head.I asked. I received. I'm teaching sewing at a county wide 4-H event this weekend. I need to have these sewing machines working and ready to go.  I tell you, this is probably impossible. Especially since my day tomorrow is taken up with a whole host of other volunteer gigs.5 donated sewing machines were dropped off at my house for me to get into working order by this weekend.  I just spent two hours taking apart a non working Pfaff from 1986.  Working now! (go me!) She's a beauty, a great sewing machine for learning since she has speed controls.  She's won a place in my heart.I got to the next one. No bobbin.  I do not have that size bobbin.  Great.And then I go onto the next one.  I did a little \"oof\" when I picked it up. It's heavy. Really heavy. It's a dinosaur.  Probably a brontosaurus.  I'm pretty sure it's from well before my grandmother's time. I opened it and may have gasped.  I think that's more than a two hour project.  Good bye brontosaurs.  Not today. Reminds me of the sewing machine I learned on.  My grandmother's knee control one. I bet that was an allosaurus. I loved that thing.And then the good ol' singer. The one she got for her anniversary. Probably a brachiosaurus.  I used to use that thing until it overheated, smoked. Had to pace myself with that one. It's still at my dad's house. So many good memories. I stitched a number of outfits for the 4-H fashion shows back in the day.  It was the 80s. You can imagine the interesting creations I came up with.  I also had a scrunchie business.  Remember scrunchies?  One to match every outfit. That was the goal.Because my machine kept overheating, I then borrowed a machine.Then for my sweet 16, my dad got me not a car, but something that I wanted even more.  My loyal, faithful and dependable companion. My sweet Janome.  We have spent hours upon hours together. I love her so.Truth is, even if I don't get all of these sewing machines fixed up before the weekend, my faithful and true Janome never lets me down. I'll bring her along and another child can learn on her.  Guessing nearly 40 kids have learned to so on her thus far. Although I have (*cough*cough*) 4 Janomes now, this one pictured below, the one my dad gave me, may always be my BFF.As for those other dinosaurs of sewing machines? Wish me luck.  Maybe one of these days I'll get them all up and running."},

That was hand raised and home grown and homemade.  I did that. This is what keeps me going.I have a love/hate relationship with gardening. Initial attempts gardening on this farm yielded a sparse production due to soil quality. I hauled loads of manure and made heaps of compost.  Soil now is top notch. However, the insects.  Those nasty little creatures. I cannot even deal with the destruction so rapidly. What I really need to do is start another whole garden so I can rotate. I'm pretty certain there are eggs from pests laid in the garden all ready for next year. I just want to squash them all!I keep on keeping on.Looking back, it is amazing that I had a baby on April 24th and planted my 40ft x 40ft garden almost immediately after. I don't know how I did that! While I did plant the garden, I didn't weed much and I didn't water at all.  Yield was about half of what the previous years were. I lost track of the exact number, but I grew ~400 pounds of food.  Not my top year by far, but not so bad either, especially since most was done with an infant in my arms.  Something is better than nothing!Pictured above are the last flowers before frost and broom corn (my first go with that). We've still been eating salads with fresh homegrown greens.I have a bowl of parsley on my counter now, ready to be made into tabbouleh. I've canned and frozen and dried as much as life with a newborn allows.  While the stuff I grew won't tide is over until next year like last year's harvest did, we still will have some home grown goodness mid winter.  To me, that's cause for celebration."},

Back at work, there's a ridiculous foul odor and come to find out a rodent died right over the ceiling tiles in the room I use.  Back at home the goats will NOT stay in their darn fence. And there's a dead rodent smell in MY kitchen that has taken me forever to locate. I've been sniffing all around my kitchen. It's the dishwasher.  Which we hired someone to install. And something is dead behind it.  I cannot make this stuff up. I fed my kids apple slices, carrot sticks and cheese and called that dinner. Know how many times I've fed them oatmeal this last week? A lot. The dryer is in regular motion because I cannot organize myself to hang out on the clothesline.  I have errands that need to be run, commitments I made and need to follow through on and my house is a disaster, especially the floors. Just tonight all at the same time, I had one kid cold and crying trying to get into the shower, the other was about dropping the dog water all over the floor and the baby was screaming and hungry.

In school back in the day, I used to say I hated group work and would request just doing the project on my own.  Was it the group work I hated or the fact that some members were not pulling their weight? Decidedly, it was the latter.So not the case now! Every team I am on, the others not only pull their own, but also go above and beyond.  Lots of new ideas, thinking outside the box and working together to make things better.  It's fun teaming up with folks who are likeminded and growing alongside of one another.Sure, homegrown tomatoes taste mighty good on their own.  But, when everyone brings their best looking tomatoes and extra fixings to the table, the salsa becomes the most amazing experience.Thankful for these incredible women I've been working with and looking forward to a big and bright future with them!"},

I worry about my husband's aunt and cousins who are in Florida waiting out the storm. There are so many who are scared right now. It's so hard to have no control.

While you are big enough to ask big questions, do things by yourself and be responsible, you are also small enough to want to play and spend your time with your parents.Your most favorite person in the world is me, your mama.  Your dad says you live, eat and breathe for me. You would be so happy to spend all day/everyday by my side.  You are my helper, keep me company, are always watching out for me and expressing your appreciation. You also love your dad and Anna-Kate. Your love for Audra goes moment by moment.  You and Audra mostly play nicely, but sometimes can be oil and water.Adrian, what I admire about you most is how you at such a young age have known what you like and who you are...and you stick to it.  I asked you the questions below and I don't think they have changed in years.  You love tractors, farming and cows. You never go anywhere without wearing something farming related.  Your play would be considered work to passerbys.  While you can join in and play doing other things,  your favorite is all things farming related.In the last year, I have been so impressed with your advancements in your drawings.  You spend a long time drawing trucks and tractors, including lots of detail.  Your favorite activity is \"crafts with scissors\", so you say. You have volumes of composition notebooks with all the tiny tractors you have cut out throughout the years. You are observant. You notice anything. If we mention the name of someone you know, you can rattle off the make and color of their vehicle.  You also notice what people are wearing and the things they like. More than I ever notice.You love books. You have organized three shelves in your room to be your 'library'. You put all your favorite books there, far out of your sister's reach. You appreciate literature that is advanced for your age and can't stand things like Junie B Jones.You are a great eater, with the exception of scrambled eggs. You loathe scrambled eggs.  So, for breakfast on your birthday, I have boiled eggs for you as well as some freshly baked muffins. If I was a betting woman, I'd guess you will be scarfing down three banana muffins first thing tomorrow morning.Adrian, you are a joy and I love you even more than you love me, which is a whole bunch.Love, MamaAnd his questions:Nicknames: AdriHow old are you? 7What is your favorite color?

I just put it on his bed when he was in the other room one day. He was so surprised. He kept it on his bed and never slept under it. He didn't want to ruin it. Every night he folded it back down. Every morning he pulled it back up. When he passed away, my dear Aunt Harriett knew how happy that quilt made him and she asked if she could keep it to remember him.  I agreed.  After she passed away, my dad one day came home with the quilt.  I am so happy to have it back, not just because I love it, but I love the journey it had gone on.

I'll make doughnuts.  Mmm.Look at the air they have here! Adrian just cannot believe this day has come.Haying day isn't really a day, it's a few days.  In those few days, all else has to be cancelled, as my kids NEED to be outside watching \"The Farming Show\".  They pretty much do nothing else but catch the show from dawn to dusk.  This year Farm Rick let both kids 'help' by riding the tractor.  It's Audra's first year 'helping'.   I am told she had plenty to say. No one minds the tractors left in the yard overnight either.  Didn't grab the camera while the big ones were awake, but at least got Anna-Kate.  Here she celebrates her first \"Haying Day\" holiday.

{"title": "Tucking it away", "date": null, "text": "Adjustment to life at home with two big kiddos and a newborn has been quite seamless for the most part. However, the last 3 or so days, everything has been more challenging.  I couldn't figure out what was happening, we were in such a good groove.  The last three days, my 2 big ones have been having so many more behaviors and just yesterday, my baby was the fussiest she has ever been.  I kept asking myself \"Why?\" and \"What changed?\"Then I figured it out.  Or at least I thought I did.It has been a super exciting last few days because my brother and sister-in-law had a baby! I'm an aunt to this adorable little nephew!  With all this excitement, I brought the computer downstairs, not wanting to miss the updates.  Usually I try to check my computer at the bookends of my day and leave it tucked away the rest of the day. Or if I do check during the day, it's just once for a recipe or something. I do not own a cell phone, so I do not check messages on that mid day either. We also do not have a TV hooked up. However, I didn't want to miss anything so the computer ended up being the front and center of my day.  My brother had been sending me all these pictures and video and we're chatting parenthood...all really good stuff I didn't want to miss. However, although I intended to only check quickly to see my brother's last message, I got sucked into this or that.  Instead of just going to the computer to see the good stuff I intended to see, there I'd go, trailing off. Without even realizing it, my quick checks were sucking up my valuable time and attention. And my kids were noticing. At least that was my theory. Today I put it to the test.  I left my computer upstairs.  I promised myself I would not check it for anything, even cute pictures of my new nephew.  Those pictures would be there at the end of the day after my kids went to bed. If my brother really had something he needed, he could and would call. He wouldn't be mad if I didn't message him right back. I didn't NEED to check the computer.  I decided to be fully present with my kids and not be distracted by the screen.I'm just in tears writing this because I have to say that today was truly one of my very best days of parenthood ever. Before kids, I'd dream of what it would be like to having a family and I'd picture everything being \"just so\".  Today that dream was reality. And more. We started the day with morning chores and we all made homemade banana muffins.  We gobbled  up yogurt with our homegrown raspberries. It was raining, so we did our morning readings on the screen porch. We've been really enjoying the Beatrix Potter Treasury, such simple and sweet stories.  Anna-Kate slept on my lap.  Audra created with (lots and lots) of glitter. Adrian made a Viking ship and treasure chest out of wood and nails.We had a nice lunch with everyone working together to prepare it and clean it up. We did chores. No one complained about said chores. The big kids helped chop for dinner prep. The sun came out and I hung the clothes out on the line. The kids played with the ducklings.  I read a chapter in the book I'm reading (!!!).  I picked raspberries the size of my thumb (we have more than we can eat now, filling the freezer!!) and the kids held a 'car wash' for their dump trucks. Anna-Kate fell asleep and napped under the grapevines.  Adrian and Audra dressed head to toe in their cowboy/cowgirl gear and had some adventure they spent a lot of time on. I don't know what it was, but it seemed serious. I picked veggies in the garden for dinner (zucchini, summer squash, beans and peas...quite the medley!).  We had a family dinner and finished evening chores. They surprised me and cleaned the bathroom. They were so cooperative that I rewarded them an extra bedtime book AND an extra chapter of Pippi Longstocking.  Bedtime for the big ones and then wide awake time with smiles and coos with Anna-Kate.The difference between today and yesterday was huge for everyone.  You can bet I'll be leaving my computer tucked away tomorrow.  They are only little once, I don't want to miss it."},

Quick thinking.  His sketch was just so darling.  I asked him if he'd recreate that sketch with sharpies on fabric. He thought it was a fantastic idea. So, he drew her this and backed it with cooking fabric (since she likes to cook), sewed it up, stuffed it and hand stitched it closed.  I was just about all hands off for this project, with the exception of guiding the sewing machine around those curves. He's just so proud of it.  As am I. Fitting he's wearing his 4-H shirt doing sewing projects.  Probably planned on his part.He actually gave her to her the morning of her birthday. Her reaction was so precious.  She loves it. No, that's absolutely not a tear in my eye.  Absolutely not. Okay, it is.

So I just haven't watered it.  Nevertheless, things are growing.  I thank all the work I've done on the soil and that it must be retaining more moisture.  We've been eating out of it for a while now, but now we're at the point where we're getting a little more variety.  Finally picked our first pepper. Tomorrow might be the day for summer squash and zucchini.  Peas and greenbeans will likely be next week.  And the berries...oh the berries.  We forage all day and still find ones we missed at the end of the day.  I cannot believe I planted all this WITH a baby, but it's there and growing.  My raspberries and grapes...can you believe all this was haying field the year we moved in!? Hello basil. I now am proud to have perpetual cilantro. It just keeps reseeding itself. I actually weeded (some) of the carrots.  Hopefully my efforts paid off. Peas were in late this year, but nevertheless, they are coming. Buckwheat is my fave thing to grow lately. If something doesn't come or I don't know what to put there, I just throw some buckwheat down. It grows with no effort, the bees love it, it keeps the weeds down, adds nutrients to the soil and I can just pull with little effort and give it to the chickens when I'm done. Looking forward to seeing what this year's harvest will bring. I imagine it won't be as high as last year (800 pounds), but we shall see. At 50 pounds so far for this year.  How are your gardens coming?Garden Update 1Garden Update 2"},

We have full freezers, full pantries, oodles of eggs and a booming garden.  We have been together for 13 years, and in those 13 years I have worked to make us more self sufficient. I had planned for this emergency.  Nothing to fear.I had a whole plan. We'd use our stores.

I was set for a great learning opportunity.But, as luck would have it, we don't need my grand master plan. The Maine State Budget passed.  My husband WILL get paid. Life will carry on. All is well. Through all this stress, I am reminded how blessed we are.  We live on this great farm and if there was a true emergency, we have the knowledge and skills to survive. Although we don't need to survive off our stores and our stores alone now, I think we shall anyway.Because this is how we do spaghetti night. Fresh greens, canned roasted tomatoes from last year, oregano, parsley, basil, garlic scapes.

Nearly every weekend, I request online what we're interested in (we have access to oodles of libraries in the state through this).  I then get an Email when it's delivered and go pick it up at our local library.The library is such a huge part of our family that I knew it was a matter of time before my kids played library.Which is exactly why I saved this fab library play set for the right time. My 8 year old self would have swooned over this! (Confession, all my books were alphabetized and I had an elaborate checkout system during my childhood days.)Audra worked checkout.  Warning-overdue books have steep fines. Adrian was chief shelver. Books in his library are organized in sections by subject...all over the house. He also has these \"For Reference Only\" stickers, which are for important books such as this informational book \"Bees Help Farmers\", written and illustrated by Adrian.We've actually been hard at work creating an elaborate library with our own books in a nook of our home. I moved all these bookshelves and they helped shelve the books.  Once it's finished, this library play will take a more serious turn, I predict. I'll try to get some pics. How fun!Meanwhile, I have been keeping track of the chapter books we've read/listened to this last year. If I got them all, 144 Chapter Books, phew! Below is our final list.

It's the name of the game.  Always learningThis year I didn't start as much from seed as I usually do. Gave myself a little break given the baby was coming. I did buy some started seedlings from the nursery, which is just fine in my book for this year. The majority of everything else is from seeds I saved (including tomatoes, bush and pole beans, peas, cilantro, greens, pumpkins and flowers to name a few), plus my own potatoes I sprouted. It's crazy to think of how many years I have been just saving seeds and re-growing from seed packets years ago.  I think the only seed packets I bought this year were broccoli, parsnips, corn and broom corn (kids want to make a broom, so we are trying something new!).  We shall see what this growing year brings us. Over the last couple of years, I have been trying to pay special attention to what sort of crops are ready to go early spring with little effort.  I noticed no matter how harsh the winter, the collard green plants from last year re-grow before going to seed.  I have been letting them grow, eating a ton early spring, then letting a few go to seed every year so volunteer plants just randomly grow. I let these volunteer plants continue to grow when I weed throughout summer and we end up with more plants and more food in the spring from their reseeding. I did the same thing last year with cilantro, letting it go to seed. This spring we have had a steady supply of cilantro from volunteer plants sprouting.  I'll let them grow and go to seed again this year so we have early cilantro next spring. In thinking about spring veggies, parsnips are another I'm focusing on.  They are an early spring food.  I have a patch I planted that will hopefully go to seed and provide us with more volunteer plants for next spring.  I'm at the point with year round garden veggies and am trying to get the maximum yield for springtime with little effort.So far, we've taken in 27 pounds of food so far from the garden.  I have harvested hardly any rhubarb and need to make it a priority to get some in the freezer for jam making this winter. I hope it will be a good growing year.The only rhubarb I have picked is what they 'surprised' me with when I least expected it.And this his how my kitchen looked in the middle of all the 'help' I received. Love them...so happy and carefree."},

Then you adjust to the new normal and get in a groove.  Now we have three and having just one or just two seems easy peasy, but the three is overwhelming.  Of course, once we find our groove, three will be just fine. It's just the adjustment. That's the tricky part.And my, is it an adjustment without Justin. He was super, super helpful all month.  Thankful I had him here when my body wasn't feeling back to normal.

This time last week, I was still pregnant and gearing up for the hardest labor and delivery I have had. So very worth it though, we've ended up with such a dream baby! This last week, I've been trying to dig my way out of a mess of a house. I seem to keep moving piles and somehow no matter how much I work at the organization, things keep piling. It's a hard balance tackling the piles, caring for a newborn and the rest of my family while also pacing myself as my body heals.  I'm thankful to have my husband home to help with the animal care and big brother and big sister. This picture truly captures life this last week. Chaos all around, but such peace gazing into these newborn eyes.My husband has been super helpful with meal planning and grocery shopping. Not that he needs to cook eggs. We have a chef who does that.  At only four, she can crack all those eggs and not get shells. Would you believe her eggs are perfectly yellow, no burn marks...always?!  It's good she likes to cook eggs, as she will eat 4 (!!!) on her own.It's nice how the weather has been such that outdoors is the preferred place to be. The green grass is making a comeback. Chickens are definitely laying. I'm running to the garden to grab fresh greens for dinners again. Spring is definitely in the air. Our three season porch still has the windows, but it won't be long before they come out and the screens go back in.  For now, it's nice and warm in the afternoon, a perfect place for an afternoon snooze/snuggle tiny squish. All in all, it's been a good week of adjusting to the new while keeping much of our day to day 'same old, same old'.  It's been quite nice to just be home sweet home."},

Constantly. Aside from snuggles, we've been reading a lot, spending time with our animals, being outside, getting dirty and trying to do some teamwork to make some good food.   Our house is a disaster, but better than yesterday, so that's progress.  My body is definitely in recovery mode, so pacing myself with baby snuggles is just perfect to make sure I don't do too much.  Sometimes I think about all I usually do this time of year with the gardens around this property, but this year I won't be doing it \"all\".  And that's okay.  I've asked for another baby for 4 years now.  Having her close to me is how I want to be spending my days, the garden will be there next year.  These infant days...I'm loving them."},

While the kids loved all three, the Secret Garden is definitely their favorite. In fact, Adrian said that on his scale of favorites that it comes right after \"Where the Red Fern Grows\" (which is his ultimate favorite). I also love the Secret Garden...especially given that we've been blessed with our own Secret Gardens here on this 1880s Maine farm. It's such a dream come true! When I saw a bucket and a granite bench through this dense and thick brush, I (and I alone) removed 7 truckloads of brush to find many perennials and the outskirts of an old goldfish pond. I have scars on my arms, but have located and brought back to life some concord grapes that are decades upon decades old. Plus there's another area the goats have helped pull back the nasty brush to see more things planted. Plus another that has so many irises and phlox interspersed with thick wild raspberries. It's truly a treasure having our own secret gardens here, although to bring all these gardens back, it will take a lifetime.  We've only been here 4 years so far, all of those years with little ones (when we first bought, two kids under the age of two)...and I'm the lone gardener...but progress has been made. I am eager to get out there, but I know this year will not be the year for big changes. Lots of our 'work' still looks like a work in progress out there.

Animal and farming stories, of course he does! I just ordered more James Herriot picture books off of interlibrary loan and some James Herriot audio. Plus I have a treasury put aside for the next holiday.I must say, I am LOVING this stage with his interest in longer books.  We just finished \"Where the Red Fern Grows\", which he has declared is his most favorite ever.  We're reading Mountain Born and Lord Fauntleroy now...both which I have never read.  He is so incredibly interested in them and I hear \"More, more!\".  He just loves the classics. We go through books so fast as of late, as I am feeling the same \"more, more!\" pull he is. While he certainly is well on his way to reading books on his own, I am truly hoping he will not tire of reading/listening to books with me anytime soon. I truly could share this love for literature with him forever and ever!His sister is really getting into the audio books too. I'm thankful I have her and another on the way, as I am looking forward to another decade (at least) of book reading together.  It might be my very favorite part of parenting....sharing books together."},

Truth is, although I missed today, I certainly didn't miss out when she was alive.  I did a lot of living with her, spent lots of time with her, took her on vacations for 7 years, had who knows how many weekly lunch dates, phone conversations and letters and I have so, so many memories. I'm lucky, lucky, lucky. Thankful I made it there for her 90th birthday, thankful she met Adrian and Audra, thankful she loved me and glad she knew that I loved her a bushel and a peck back.  I'm so blessed to have had such a great grandmother all these years.  She will be missed, but the memories are mine to hold on to forever. When she met Adrian When she met Audra"},

Farming. Tractors.  You still hardly go a day without wearing some \"John Deere\" apparel. Even though you love farming, you spend just as much time drawing and creating as you do farming.  Your art has more details than even a few months ago.  We find homemade books upon books and you could use a whole pack of paper in a week.  You also cut your favorite stuff out and paste it in scrapbooks still. Mostly tractors, but occasionally other random things. You are definitely not a sports guy and you'll tell anyone that.  You love to 'work' around the farm. Any job-plowing, shoveling, collecting eggs, tending animals, taking out the compost...you want to do it.  You're such a handy helper to have around!You are such an eager learner.  You keep these nature displays with all the random things you find. You've been interested in learning about birds, plants you can eat and predators. You could listen to anything on audio all day long. Your most recent love is the Boxcar children. You're also becoming quite the reader yourself!While you do enjoy going places, home is your most favorite place to be. You are never, ever bored. You always have plenty of ideas to fill your time.  You still are a mama's boy though.  Anywhere I go, you're right there. You're mature beyond your years with your seriousness, your memory, your thoughtfulness, kindness and your honesty, but I love how you're not too old to snuggle your stuffed animals or show affection to your parents wherever we go. You are such a fun 6 and a half year old, I am lucky to call you mine. Love, mamaAnd his questions:Nicknames: AdriHow old are you? 6 1/2What is your favorite color?

{"title": "January Days", "date": null, "text": "One of my most favorite months of the year is January. I know, it's a month many are not a fan of, especially those who live in winter climates.  I love when all the holiday business dies down and it's too cold/snowy to get things done outside.  Obligations are fewer, calendars are more sparse. We can be home sweet home for days, in pajamas if we want to be!  This January has been awesome so far.  In 4 days we have only been to the library and church. And we get home and change back into our pajamas, naturally.  The projects, the play, the crafts, extended reading time, the togetherness... I'm enjoying every minute.Here's a bit of what we've been up to....She's been doing glitter.  All the glitter.  It's all over our house. And painting nails. She painted mine. And hers. And Holly's. And Kammie's. Plus Ms. Mother Hen is practicing to be a sister....with her mama made dolls and Zip. Lucky Zip. He's been doing Legos. All the legos! And a lot of drawing. Plus making books.  This is his animal book we finally put into a binder. There's likely 100+ animals he has written a fact and drawn a picture about. He's been working on it for months. He's mighty proud of this book. But he also has been making books with stories...a rescue adventure and one about going to the doctor.I'm so excited that there's still a lot left to January....which means we have lots more time at home and lots more time to do what we love best."},

Audra cannot wait to pick outfits out and help dress the baby. I have a feeling I will not get to play 'dress up' too often with Audra around helping.  I'm so excited for both of my kids to be big silblings to a newborn!"},
{"title": "Winter Rhythm", "date": null, "text": "If you've been around these parts long enough, you know I'm a huge advocate for rhythm with kids. Not schedule with a timeline, but a rhythm or a pattern in how we do things. A 'first, then, next' type of approach instead of a 9:00, 10:00, 11:00 approach. I swear having a strong and consistent rhythm makes a huge difference with behavior and cooperation.  Things flow better with a good rhythm.Living in Maine, our rhythm always seems to change with the seasons. I'm reflecting back on the rhythms of past winters.  I recall beginning our mornings starting a fire and snuggling until we got warm one winter.  Another winter I remember Adrian crawling into bed with me and we'd read a chapter of a book before we had breakfast. Last year my kids would meet me in the barn and sit with me as I finished morning milking. Such fond memories.This year?  Not such a gentle peaceful start to the day as we were used to years past.  My kids are all hyped up in the morning lately. I have gotten into the pattern of rolling out of bed and sending them outside.  We throw snowpants over their pajamas and off they go. In a way, it doesn't make sense to bundle them up and send them out the coldest part of the day, when the sun has just barely peeked it's way up, but I tell you, when they come in the house, it's been awesome.  Energy is gone, appetite is up. By the time they come back in, I've finished morning chores, I have a fire going and their breakfast is on the table.  We then can dive into our morning readings and projects that I do with them each day (regardless of whether I'm working or not).It fascinates me how different our rhythm is from one season to the next and from one winter to the next.  What I am thankful for is that we find that rhythm, the rhythm that grounds us, sets up our days for success and keeps us plenty busy and motivated."},

I wish I had a fraction of your energy!You biggest loves are your animals.  You tote Hop and our cats around like they are stuffed animals. You painted our dogs' toenails. You are the chicken and goat whisperer.  You hardly have a need for stuffed animal toys as you more frequently play with the real versions.You have a loving heart, make up worship songs and pray for people regularly.  You would give anything you own (except your animals) to anyone.

You can work scissors like a grown up. Your writing is so very tiny.  Art projects hold your attention for quite some time.

Sobbed for the 2 hours a week when he'd be at my neighbors every week, even though we saw them almost daily, up until he was over 2 years of age. Every activity has had such an elaborate transition, even though we'd always be right there.  Since his sister was doing dance, we told him he could sign up for something.  No interest in dance.  Claims he hates sports. Our local animal shelter hosted a \"camp day\" entitled \"Pizza and Pets\".  Learn about pets, do crafts, eat pizza, snuggle animals.  Read him what it was all about and he wanted to be signed up, so he said. We fully expected him to either ask to not go or ask for a parent to be there with him.  But nope. Not the case. Although he knew no one and has never been to a daycamp, he marched right in.  Upon pickup, when he saw me, he gave me the grumpiest face ever.  I thought he was mad that we left him, but instead, he was mad that it was time to go!  Look how proud he is up there with the print he made at the program!Just what we, as his parents, had a feeling about all along.  In time, through supporting him and not pushing him, he'd grow his wings. He's all ready to be signed up for the next camp there.  We couldn't be prouder!"},

Here's the previous years.20112012201320142015This year, I was trying to think of what I want to re-cap, or what I want to remember about 2016. In past years, I included a lot of stuff I made and the highlight photos of the year.This year, I am sort of focusing on something different, specifically the homesteading lifestyle I have been shooting for. I want to be as self sufficient as possible. I want my kids to be free ranging kids who are able to roam. I want them to learn what sparks their interest in a way and at a pace that feels good to them. I want to keep them from being overly exposed to media. I want to be home. I want to let them get dirty. I want to be together.  I want a good rhythm that grounds our days. I want them to look back at their childhood and think that although it was different from most kids' childhoods....that it couldn't have been better.There are some days I fall short.  Lately, being pregnant with my 3rd, I lose a lot of steam at night. Things don't get done. There's clutter. There's challenges with cooperation. There's defeat. Lingering to do lists. Things breaking. Feelings of discouragement. What I want to remember is those moments of frustration are just that...moments. They clearly don't define the success of this past year. I have my health, my family, my two (soon to be 3 kids), a plethora of animals and my dream home.  I have learned even more this year than years past with all my homesteading adventures. Our kids have been kept home another year and I feel they have truly reaped the benefits of living this lifestyle. Those moments of challenge are distant memories, in the forefront of my thoughts are the blissful times we have shared this year, evidenced by this collection of photos.

My dad stayed at our house.  While he was at our house, a woman arrived with gifts she made for the kids. She said that we wouldn't know her, but she was a friend of a friend and had made a special gift for our kids. My dad said he noticed right away that the mittens were specifically made for them...given the John Deere ones for Adrian and the Rabbit ones for Audra. The kind woman met my kids at the draft horse plow day we went to (which if you haven't seen the pics from that day, they are here...and they are some of my most favorite pictures of the year!) and as my kids were visiting person to person gathering treats, she had traced their hands on a paper plate so she knew the sizes to make.

It was so funny when they were praising him, he just shrugged and said \"I'm just into birds.\"  Which is totally true, he's even wrote some 'books' on the subject (how I love the 'books' he writes!). They loaded him up with all these color sheets to bring home and he knocked my socks off by coloring all these black and white images true to their actual markings...by memory.  Glad I finally stitched this patch onto a shirt.

It was okay, but not how I pictured my ideal living room in this old house. I wanted old things with a fresh look and multiple different pieces to make this room multipurpose.So, what did I do? First, I took almost everything out.  I took apart our broken couch. I gave away the braided rug. I gave away our huge chair and ottoman. I took all the art down that I had up.I kept the TV Cabinet I painted ages ago (which the TV hasn't been on since Christmas movies last year, I'm totally debating just getting rid of it), my antique china cabinet, the free chair I already reupholstered, a couple of antique/vintage tables, the antique/vintage lamps and a rug I bought last winter.Now, for the re-do.  I cannot believe how I have a new room for such a small investment.  First is the reupholstered couch I paid $35 for off of craigslist and spent about $25 to reupholster it.  I love this solid piece!  Then the $30 100% wool 9x14  rug I scored at the thrift store.  Then the table and chairs, which I haven't posted before.  Nice old set. $40 at a yard sale.  Then the art is from my dad, his old vintage bird posters. I also swiped some clippings from my dad's succulents and house plants to add. So, some patience, some searching, and some hard work, $130 it's out with the old and in with the new.       It was so freeing to pass on the stuff that worked well enough, but I didn't love. Now I have the living room I wanted and I'm very happy about it.  The table for projects and board games, the comfy spots for books, the space to play, the warm fireplace.  It's just what I was hoping for.

Cannot wait for baby #3!I just realized I never shared the re-cap of our country kids party. If you've been around these parts, you know that we forgo big birthday parties in favor of one HUGE Country Kids Party for the benefit of a charity. We've done this for 4 years.This year's charity came about after the challenges we've had in getting approved as foster parents, a process that was started in February 2016. While our 1880s home is perfectly fine for us, the banister height doesn't meet the minimum regulations for the state to place a child in our home. Once this was discovered, we were told we needed to pay for a new banister (>$1000 of work) or end the application process. Given our extra $$ is earmarked for parts of the barn so it doesn't fall down, extra money to fix a working banister wasn't in the cards.   I learned that it is common for appropriate foster parents to be turned down because of the hefty requirements of the state, window size being the biggest challenge.  So, we decided our party would be to help raise money for good families to make the state regulated changes to host foster kids.This year we had 89 folks come to our party and raised almost $400.  Hopefully that money will help a family get set up to take foster kids.As for us, the fostering process has taken SO long that now we are in a different boat with expecting a baby.  While now isn't the time, we aren't giving up! I have contacted local state reps about the challenges with meeting state regulations and proposed my idea of a forgivable loan through the state to make the necessary changes, to be repaid by family fostering in service. This has never been proposed before and I have a sponsor and a co sponsor for a bill hoped to debut next month.  They have asked me to be a part in helping tell our story, so I will see what's in store with me for that. Exciting!Insofar as the Country Kids party, it was a blast!

After drooling over this wood cookstove for 3 years, we finally got it. It's so nice to be able to cook and heat simultaneously. And is there a better place to listen to our audiobooks?  (We just loved the entire Kit Kitridge American Girl Series.  All 8.5 hours of the audio book we loved.

Adrian kept her company. 3) The bleeding finally slowed down.4) Once Audra put Serena back in the pasture, Serena immediately peed.

It's a well kept place with thriving gardens, knowledgeable staff and interesting things.  Transportation is horse and buggy.  We had a horse drawn boat ride.  We spent oodles of time in the working mills-the woolen mill, saw mill and flour mill. All run on water power. We toured many homes, many had workers in the homes tending fires, making meals and going about day to day business.  We saw a school session, many animals and the horse and buggy hauling hand cut hay. We checked out the dressmaker's house, the quilting house, the fiber dying house, the print shop, the blacksmith, the tin maker, the cabinet maker, the bread maker, the tinsmith, the shoe maker, the broom maker, the cheesemaker, and I know I must be forgetting some. There's the tavern and the church and the hotel. Oh, and the general store-with the post office, fabric for sale, sweets, transferware, cast iron, tin cups, flour and sugar, etc. It's so neat to go back to a fave childhood memory and see that the good got even better.  My kids loved, as did my husband, which is saying a lot, as this type of stuff isn't his thing usually.And now I share with you oodles of pictures.

Why not? 11pm, I cut out the dress and by 1am that night, I had already basted and altered the dress.  I was anxious to hear my husband's opinion the next morning. If he liked it, I'd finish it instead of basting it.  If he didn't think it looked right, I'd go shopping.  Verdict? My husband not only liked it, but loved it too.  That night, I took a pic to show some girlfriends and got the thumbs up from them too.I was so relieved.  I think it takes me less time to make a good fit dress than it is for me to shop for it. I hate shopping. Anyway, I had may compliments, it's comfortable and I definitely will wear it again.  I really ought to make more clothes.

If you're local, please come and bring your friends. If you are not local, supporting us with a good old thumbs up is helpful too! What?  A simple, country kids festival to celebrate the country in our kids. There might be simple games, perhaps a craft, you can pick some wildflowers, take a walk in the field, feed the goats, hold a tiny goat, snuggle a chicken, catch the train going by, help us clear out the secret garden, etc.  Sept. 2nd 4:00-6:30 at our house in Wells, Maine.  Cost? This is our annual party for charity. This year the donations we collect  will go towards foster care. My husband and I have been working on becoming foster parents since February.  We have not been able to become foster parents because (although functional) our stairway railing in this historic home is not tall enough for us to be approved by the state to be a suitable placement. The change is costly. During this process, we have discovered it is not atypical for a family to be denied because of railing heights or window sizes or other state regulations.  Currently there are not funds to help families meet state regulations.  If a family, who otherwise is an excellent fit for fostering, cannot front the cost for the changes, they are not able to become foster parents.  Funding has been a stumbling block for us given our extra funds are all going towards fixing serious foundation problems with the barn. We cannot afford to do both. Funds collected will go to people like us...people who have the heart to help children in foster care, but cannot until costly changes are made to their home. What to wear?  Overalls, plaid shirts, blue jean dresses, cowboy boots, barn boots,  straw hats.  Or whatever suits your fancy.  Food?  We'll have lemonade, light snacks, as well as a couple desserts.  Bring your own drink and sandwich and plan to have a picnic with us.  Come anytime 4:00 and after (not before please). Stop by for a quick visit or stay for a bit.

My mom would bring us to swim lessons at the local beach, the moms used to huddle under the small pavilion shelling peas/snapping beans/chatting while simultaneously urging us to plunge into the frigid waters for lessons, followed by an occasional stop at the store for a slush puppy (are all those flavors still around? Watermelon...yum!), home to have a swig from our outside water fountain (at our own house...it was a really neat thing to have at home!) with a daily picnic outside on our red picnic table.  We then would huddle on the couch and my mom would read us afternoon books on the couch...as many as we wanted. Then we were outside playing or helping in the garden until my dad came home for evening chores/dinner.Fond memories of just the special day to day.  We sort of do some of the same summer traditions as my childhood today, only  in what seems to be reverse.  We do not have an outside water fountain, but after telling my kids about that today, I think I have one on my 'want' list.  Regular summer days at home here start with chores, garden work/time for them to play or help, lunch on the screen porch, then as many books as they want on the picnic blanket outside (today I read 20, Twenty!), then either a dip in the kiddie pool or a dip in the ocean (we go, swim and come back all within the hour, how lucky are we!), followed by dinner.  I wonder if these are the types of things they'll tell their children when they hear \"Tell me more!\"?There's a little tradition we do here that was not a childhood tradition for me.  An hour before bed, it's no clothes, just underwear time.  Don't worry, just the kids, not me.

You do everything big. You run fast. You go forever. You love big. You can climb walls, pull yourself wherever you want and never ever tire. For books, you love reading the same book over and over and over again. Your brother always says what the rest of us are thinking \"Not that again!\" The older books like \"Make Way for Ducklings\" are ones that really capture your attention. You are quite the artist, especially with watercolors. You love a project...sewing, crafty, baking and you thoroughly enjoy the whole process.  Somehow you learned not only your letters by recognition, but how to write them on your own.You dive so deep into your pretend world at times. Lately, you've been playing a lot of caretaker with all of your children. You love dressing them up again and again.When we can't find you, you're in the garden eating.  Green onions, raw greens, herbs and peas. Soon it will be raspberries...and you'll leave none for us.You can do everything yourself.  Everything. At least that is what you say to us all the time.You love your mama and daddy equally and still have plenty of love to give others. You can hold a conversation on the phone better than any teenager. You have such an amazing love for your brother. You are a mother hen to all the baby chicks and also spend a lot of time with the 'smaller' animals on our farm.  You love all things tiny, the tiny chicks the best.Your birthday menu per request (which makes me want to cringe!): hotdogs, cheese balls, corn on the cob and cantaloupe. You want to know if you can eat all the hotdogs you want on your birthday (no). Although you have your favorites, you'll eat anything really.  Especially meat. You are a carnivore! Your days are best when you sleep....which is a rarity.  We're all hoping this coming year will be the year you turn into a sleeper.All in all, you are a girl with fierce loves, tons of spunk and the drive to be independent.  You can melt our heart and drive us mad in the same 5 minute time period.  Life with you certainly is entertaining. Age four is going to be fantastic, I'm sure of it!I loves you sweet girl, MamaI asked you a list of questions that I hope to repeat every year. (Find your copy here).

They've been so magical as of late.  The blooms, sunsets, awesome evening temps, we've been loving it.  Plus finishing it off with homemade ice cream has been pretty awesome too.My kids wanted to invite friends (new and old) to another OPEN FARM TIME!We'll be home and outside 5:30-7:30 pm Thursday June 16th.  I'll be planting another round of corn and doing evening animal chores (cows, rabbit, goats, chickens and collecting eggs) and kids are welcome to help.  My kids will be picking wildflowers, playing in their hedge they call the \"Hundred Acrewood\" or running round.  After chores are done, we'll have some ice cream.  You're welcome to come, bring your picnic dinner, bring more ice cream (if we have the turnout like last time, the ice cream I have won't be enough!) or toppings or spoons or bowls.  The train goes by around 6:45, so plan to see that.  If you need directions, send me a message (and I'll plan to check messages around lunchtime ...I'm trying so hard to be screen free during the day, but I'll make an exception).  All are welcome to come. Feel free to share with friends.  Even if you're not local, could you help friends out by 'liking' this on facebook so more than 2 people see the post?  Facebook only shows other people if it has 'likes'. Annoying, huh?  Hope to see some of you soon!"},
{"title": "Summer Picnics", "date": null, "text": "Last year I made it my goal to go on a picnic every week. That I did, and shared many of those picnics with you in this space. I don't really have a goal to have a certain number of picnics this year, but definitely think picnics deserve a place of importance during summer. Trying to simplify things, I made a bunch of muffins and put them in the freezer.  Now if I am feeling like it's a picnic day, I can grab a few muffins, some fruit, some peanuts and whatever is fresh a the moment in the garden for a veggie.  Add a quart of milk makes it complete picnic at a moment's notice. I'm sort of excited about my pre planning success and we did a picnic last minute here. I don't know why I have never been to the local community garden space.  I really should have rented a spot way back before we had our farm. I've never grown vegetables overlooking the ocean before!This is what it looked like last month.  I think I need to go back mid summer to see everything at peak. I love that we've been on so many picnics over the last couple of years but still are discovering new places to picnic."},

One day, I sort of had enough.

{"title": "Gardening 2016: Update 2", "date": null, "text": "Somehow over a  month slipped by without a gardening update.  It's not because I haven't been out there. I assure you, I have been.  In fact, it was in April that I did way too much and my tendonitis flared right up.  From that point forward, I decided I wasn't going to do but a mere 20-40 minutes at a time.  So that's what I've been up to for the last 5 weeks.  Bookends of the day, I've been out there, getting dirty.  A 40x40 garden is certainly time consuming and feels even more so since I've only been able to plant in small bursts.  It's a relief today was a rainy day...a fantastic respite from planting.Here's what our garden looked like in April: (Click link below)Garden Update #1Speaking of soil, I am so proud of myself. It's the darkest it's ever been and it's all due to all the manure hauling I've been doing. Hopeful the yield will beat last year's yield with this improved soil quality. Last year I had >700 pounds.  This year is at 28.5 pounds thus far. Not a bad job since it's been mostly greens. Speaking of greens, I thought I'd take a quick minute to give my views about them. While my whole family loves greens, the amount of lettuce I grow is hardly any. I get so frustrated with all that work and it bolting before we even get into it much.  Who can stand bitter lettuce? Not me. While do grow some short lived greens, the greens I focus on are kale, swiss chard and collard greens. Those don't bolt.  They stay green and tasty up until frost and beyond.  You can sautee, use for salads or put in sandwiches. I've had this little system going with my collards. They grow like crazy through the year. I pick them up until frost. I don't pull them over winter. Come spring, they pop up and grow. We enjoy fresh collards until they flower out. They flower out (about now), die and dry out.  The seeds spread, which end up being my next round of collards.  We've had so many the last couple of weeks due to this system. Only now, we've had collard greens so much, we're all ready to move onto the next veggie.The majority of the garden is from seeds, although I did buy peppers, eggplant and basil.  I didn't bother starting peppers and eggplants this year and my basil failed 2x. I also bought a few tomatoes since theirs were much farther along than mine. A great way to extend the harvest. I did the same with cukes, I have some I grew and some I got already started, just to extend the harvest.   So what's planted other than those I just mentioned?  Cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage.  3 kinds of beans and peas. Zucchini, yellow squash. Tons of tomatoes.  Parsnips, carrots.  Sugar pumpkins, spaghetti squash, butternut squash and acorn squash. Red and white potatoes. Onions. I planted more annual flowers than I have ever planted before. I'm sure there's more than what I listed, I just can't remember. I keep tucking something else in.  I still have another round of corn to plant, but wanted to wait a couple weeks, hoping to stagger when it's ready.  I didn't grow corn last year and it didn't do  well the year before that. My kids are really hoping for a good harvest. So far something seems to be eating the tops of my tomatoes.  Or it's the cat rolling on them.  Definitely could be the latter.  We have more grubs than I've ever had before, I hope they don't bother things. The kids are so much older now that they are much better at not stepping on things.  It's usually the cats and kids who threaten the plants the most.  Those cabbage butterflies have been out, hoping two cute kids with butterfly nets (thank you grampy and grammy!) will fix that situation. Even though I haven't been giving you the garden play by play updates, I've been taking pictures.  Hopefully you can see the transformation. It's been five weeks since the end of April, here's the week by week. I promise the next update won't have 5 weeks worth of updates. Week one: Week 2Week 3Week 4:Week 5Although I complain about the planting, it is mighty magical how the three of us come together (my littles and me) to plant that which we need for the year.  It's something they'll remember as an adult, just as I remember planting the garden with my parents 30+ years ago.  Now that it's all in, we're hoping and praying for a good harvest. And my husband is particularly praying the potatoes do better than the squash this year. After all the squash we've had last winter, I don't blame him one bit.And you? What do you have in the works? I'd love a little garden chatter to keep me motivated.  I sort of get a little down about the garden here and there, so a little garden talk is good to keep me on track."},

Did that on Saturday. Checked on Sunday.  Worked 11 hours and then attended a 4-H meeting on Monday, with the bookends of my day being tending the animals and children....I just didn't check. First thing Tuesday morning, cold incubator. Cold eggs.  The entire outlet stopped working.  I felt so defeated. On the way out the door on Tuesday, I asked my husband to dispose of the eggs. Instead, he just plugged them back in to a different outlet.  Glad he did!  On Saturday, we had two chicks hatch.  Stone cold eggs into chicks....what a miracle!  Certainly not the up to 35 that I was expecting, but it was something at least!I noticed that this tiny little black chick wasn't doing well.  His little toes were all curled in and he couldn't stand on his feet.  I've had this happen before and the chick ended up dying.  Last time around, we tried an intervention, but we were too late.  This time, I recognized the need straight away and decided to jump into some habilitation.  Especially since if that one died, the lone chick might also die from being alone (those chicks love flocks). I made tiny sandals and taped them to the chick's toes/feet with painter's tape.  After 16 hours of having splinted legs, that baby chick was able to stand up.

Do a little, rest that arm a little.  So hard to do when my entire to do list requires hand movements.  At least the soil is better now from all that cow manure and things will grow better anyway. Hopefully we'll have the outside water working again soon and goodness.....it's not even memorial day, so I have time.Why do I garden if it feels like a chore?  I garden because I want to give my family homegrown. Sure the growing process can seem arduous, but having our own food to consume?  That's something amazing. Last year I preserved 700 pounds of my homegrown fruits and veggies (as well as lots of quarts of apple/pear sauce from friends' trees) and this is the very first year the produce has lasted a whole year.  Except for a handful of meals in this last year, each meal has revolved around something I was trying to use us up.  A whole year of cooking like  this, I can hardly believe it! Just yesterday, our dinner was Cajun fish (using my own herbs), squash soufflé (own squash), canned pears (picked fresh) and my own frozen green beans.  Each item on the menu used something homegrown.  How about that?  It's just about rhubarb season and I still have rhubarb in the freezer. Summer is right around the corner and  I still have lots of canned fruit, tomatoes, jam and sauces.  I still have squashes, pumpkins and green beans as well as peppers and basil frozen.  I have plenty of dried herbs still left and lots of dried kale.  And here I am in May with garden fresh parsnips, collards, green onions and herbs dominating our meals.  Never have we gone without a homegrown one day in the last year.  So yes, I sort of groan about the gardening portion, but I am celebrating our homegrowns...for that's the whole reason why I garden.  I feel mighty successful about that.I am trying to gear myself up to being  little more enthusiastic.  I organized my garden tools to have a single caddy with all my necessities.  Grab and go garden caddy....it certainly has come in handy! Kids have theirs set...with whatever random stuff they found.   I bought all those caddies at thrift shops for $2-3 a piece for a few dollars, we are garden ready.

I shift my mind right to the happiness, where I want those memories to be. I'm thankful.  I'm thankful to have been inspired by an amazing, loving, energetic, giving and social woman. She spent her days giving all she had to my brother and me and her influence runs deep.  Every picture I have of her, her love radiates.  I am one lucky girl to have had a mom like her.My very first wedding (Uncle Randy and Aunt Di) My very first trip to Maine...who would have guessed I'd make Maine home sweet home?!Wasn't she lovely?I'm thankful to still have my gram alive.  My mom's mom.  I don't know anyone more loving, complimentary and positive than her.   She was definitely a strong maternal figure in my life, especially when my mom was ill and after she passed. I'm so thankful that once I was in college, I decided to make a point to take my gram on a vacation every year.  For seven years, we gallivanted together and I have oodles of pics to remember our travels by. Thankful that although she cannot travel any longer, I'm still able to visit her every summer.And so it goes, we're onto the next generation.  I get to ring in the new year with this little lady who is not a fan of sleeping.  She's talked about chickens and sheep. She's fixed my hair, rubbed my back, given me a dozen kisses, explained how much she loves me and given my shoulders a quick massage. Seems as though she's handing out the Mother's Day presents early... and apparently sleeping isn't one of them! She is mighty cute....so that makes up the no sleep. Sorta.Wishing you a very special Mother's Day."},

{"title": "Farming Failures", "date": null, "text": "I am a woman who runs this little farm.  At one point, I had >80 animals here, so some don't consider this homestead small.  But regardless of size...tiny, small, medium sized, it's a farm.  And I run it.  I am a woman who runs a farm. I raise and tend chickens, goats, cows, our rabbit, dogs and cats. I milk the cow, make butter, yogurt and cheese. I collect and sell our eggs.  I tend our garden and preserve so much food that each day we are still eating mostly homegrown.  I am also a part time working mom and a homeschooling mama of two.  Pair my schedule with my husband's, we get only two days a month that we co parent.  If I ask, he does help when he can, but mostly, especially because of our schedules, I'm flying solo.You know, I have gotten some unsolicited feedback from time to time, mostly about the schedule I keep and all I'm trying to do. I've been told before that no one can manage all that and that it's just a matter of time before I fail.  In the last two weeks, I've really questioned whether or not I can do this without failing.With farming, there's bound to be deaths and it's so hard when there's a wave of them. I was planning on drying up our milkcow in prep for her August calf. I've been the only one who has been milking...I was looking forward to a couple months of a break.  I've even been working on the freezer stash, prepping for that milk hiatus. Instead, I went out the other night to find a dead calf. And just when I was feeling comfortable and not overwhelmed with the volume of milk coming in each day, more milk started coming.  So.much.milk.Nearly three weeks ago, I had the kids fill the incubator with eggs.  I had 35 viable, took them out of the egg turner and locked them down in prep for hatching.   All was working fine.  The next day, the outlet stopped working. Cold eggs. We lost them all.  And then there was a chicken who was dying in the coop. The last time this happened, I couldn't bring myself to put her out of her misery and she died such a sad death.  I felt so guilty that I couldn't humanely take her life. I.just.couldn't.do.it.   This time around, I knew I had to suck it up and do it.  I don't know how I mustered up the courage, but I did it. I killed a hen for the very first time.  And then our rabbit ran away.Who am I? Who have I become?  Why do I keep failing at everything I touch?  Is this who I want to be?I totally caught myself thinking that. I made a conscious decision to not wallow in the failure.  I say 'the', because it's not like it's anything \"I\" did.  Just circumstantial.  And really, are they failures or learning opportunities? This old house living...something is always breaking. You better bet I'll be choosing a different outlet next time.  And about the cow?  I figured out how to read her heats, called the breeder at the appropriate time and she actually did get pregnant.  That's certainly not something I knew about a year ago! And that chicken? While I don't want to do have to do that again, I imagine I will at some point. It comes with the territory.  Thinking about that chicken's death being so much quicker than the last who died, I know I did the right thing.  And our rabbit, Hop?  He came back days later and with the help of friends, I caught him.All my rebuttals have *I* in them. Because *I* am learning, growing and becoming more self sufficient and independent.  I used to count on my husband to do the rototilling...but I know I can do that now.  I put up a good portion of the last fence by myself. I know how to fix things. I stacked nearly all of the wood outside last year and now I split wood with an ax. I am turning into one tough chick....one who will not let all these failures rattler her. In fact, I had such an interesting compliment from my husband.  He said \"I see you handle that cow. You're much smaller than that cow, but she knows you're boss.\" That's right. I am in control. The majority of our animals are still alive, so I must be doing *something* right, yes? I hope so.I remember earlier in our marriage, a visitor, who was a man, offered to start a fire for me. \"No thanks, I've got this\", I said.  His response?  \"You know how to start fires?\"  I absolutely do.   Sure, not every fire I start is lit in one match.  Sometimes they might take 2 or 3 or 4 matches.  I don't give up until it's lit.  That's right. I've got this.  This farm? I'm not giving up on it either. I've got this.One day at a time...tomorrow will be better!"},

{"title": "For Me.", "date": null, "text": "The last couple of months, I've faced challenges I never thought I'd be up against and experienced a wide range of emotions. Stress really gets a mind thinking, doesn't it?   I've thought a lot about and reflect on who I am.  I've done all sorts of different things throughout my life...traveled, explored, volunteered, tried, read about, participated in, etc. Some things I participated in because I wanted to, some because I thought I should, sometimes I felt obligated and some I just went with the flow.My interests have always been....well....quirky compared to my peers.  I'm thankful during my elementary, middle and high school years I had peers who embraced me even if they weren't into the stuff I was interested in.  I was the kid who got a sewing machine and a serger for my sweet 16 and 18th birthdays (perfect gifts still in use from my dad!).  I made a bunch of friends their prom dresses and graduation dresses.  Many of my high school friends still have the quilts I made them.  The home ec. teacher used to let me stay after school in her room to stitch while I was waiting for whatever extracurricular I had signed up for at the time.  For all that, I was thankful.  Going to college, I was scared I wouldn't fit in.  I had a really rough first semester figuring out my place and making friends. I had left all my sewing at home, for fear I'd be the odd one.  I cried alligator tears when I told my dad I didn't want to go back at Christmas time. I did go back and I brought my sewing and could finally unwind.  What do you know, I made some great friends....who loved my quirkiness. And each semester was better than the rest. I ended up having a blast during those college days. And then onto grad school.  I brought all my sewing, my recipes and my crafts.  I decided that I was going to do what I wanted and what I loved.  That was when I started my plight to self sufficiency.  Just the other day, I was talking with a friend about obligations.  You know the kind...the kind when someone signs you or your group up and then pressures you into following through.  Or the kind that you'll either make yourself feel or someone else will make you feel awful if you pass. This sort of stuff used to always bother me and I was definitely the habitual 'yes' attendee.  I've come a long way from those days of guilt.  I say no to a lot.  We stay home more often than many. \"Not this time.\"  \"I'm going to decline.\" I tell you, what an empowering power to exercise...the strength of that word 'no' can be so freeing. My little family had a family meeting a bit ago.  We decided to define our family.  We decided that our little Lipsky family are three things:  We have faith.  We choose to be together.  We want to always be kind.  Faith, kindness, togetherness.  There's lots of good things to do in the area we live in...but if it doesn't fit our vision of living our faith, being kind to others and being together, we pass.  It's been such a helpful tool in steering our activities according to who we want to be.  It's funny.  35 year old or 35 years young (however you look at it), I've learned so much and still have so much more to learn.  As I grow and learn, I'm without doubt going to try to keep being me.  And who am I exactly? Still figuring that out. So far, I've got:  I'm a lover of Christ, mother and wife.  There's so much need out there, I want to keep expanding my giving.  I love children, animals and being home.  I love handmade, homemade, homegrown and hand milked.    I love wool blankets, fancy transferware, comfortable skirts and vintage aprons.  I love line dried clothes, a warm fire, a beautifully set table and fresh flowers.  I love walks in the field, dirt beneath my fingernails and picking hay from my hair. I love the perfect cup of coffee,  melty chocolaty baked goods paired with cold milk, taking a frame worthy picture and stitching in natural light. I love my support network, taking care of my family and I love hearing my littles call me \"Mama\".In reflecting about all things happy, I randomly decided to funnel my happy energy into stitches...for me this time. It's been years since I've made something for myself....I just might do so more often."},

You think of others, you are thoughtful and generous.  You are the most responsible kid ever. You keep things tidy and you always clear your plate at the table without even being asked. You love staying home and you say you'll be homeschooled forever. You spend a lot of your day doing art. You love to create things and cut tractors out of magazines. While you were nervous to start, you really have enjoyed your friends at homeschool co-op.  In fact, you claim you've found your bride.  You have a yellow bat ring in a plastic box with pink lace in your room, awaiting the right time to ask.You remember everything. As in the truck you got in the hospital when you were 21 months old when your sister was born (there's not even any pictures of that to remind you!). You have an amazing memory and you are always truthful.  If you say it happened, it did. You love to eat pancakes any dessert with fruit and cold raw milk. You also love honey roasted peanuts and corn. Such a random variety.  But no beef. You tell people you don't eat cow.Speaking of cows, you love love love cows. Talk about them daily. And tractors. You are going to work in a John Deere dealership someday.  You are a very, very hard worker in the barn and care for your animals regularly.  Never do  you go a day or night without John Deere apparel.  Most days you wear John Deere Overalls, a John Deere undershirt, a John Deere long sleeved shirt, a John Deere hat and John Deere socks. You sleep in John Deere pajamas.  Intense, I tell you. I actually took all your other clothes away because you never wear them.  You're growing your hair long for winter, but will have it short for summer, so you say. How practical. Every single day, I count my blessings that I have you in my life. You are very serious and oh so loving and such a great kid to have around.  Adrian, happy 5 and a HALF.  Have a good day, buddy."},

Indoor/outdoor cats. Not by our choice, but because that's the way they were when they became a part of our family.  Zip and Zoom are the best of friends.  They are everywhere we are, super loveable and friendly.  They also are fantastic mousers when the weather is right. Just today when we pulled into the driveway, we saw Zoom laying on the porch steps.  This morning, Zip kept me company in the barn during milking. I just love being outside and then all of a sudden one of these cats arrive out of nowhere for a random pat or snuggle.  I love just looking and appreciating our farm and have a cat jump into my panoramic view.     Having cats certainly turns a house into a home.  ﻿"},

It's waaaay too cold. The chickens have their huge run right now and the goats and our milk cow are together.  Last month, we passed the calf on to a new family.  I don't think I mentioned that here. We loved Oliver and he was a good calf, but I never set out to have a herd. Having less 5 gallon buckets of water to bring out, less manure to scoop, one less mouth to feed was a good choice for us. Oliver is still ours though, we're sharing him with the new family.  Come butcher time, we'll split him.  This will be interesting for me, as I have only bought beef for our table once in the last 12 years we've been together and it was a birthday meal for my husband. My husband is super excited to have beef. As for me?  Well, I don't know what I think about all that.  Back to those frigid temps.  Call me crazy, I don't care.  I have been treating them with warmness for treats.  Molasses water, warm oats. Most animals seemed okay, except for our goat Katy.  She's always been the shy/nervous goat. She's spent a lot of time quivering or shivering in this cold.  Not sure if she's nervous or if she's freezing, but I decided to do a little something about it. I upcycled a wool sweater and upcycled the elastic ties from my husband's old (broken) coat.  I made a mini turnout blanket.   A coat. For a goat.  I'd say she looks mighty fine in it.

I always dreamed of having children who enjoyed reading, would listen to the stories and snuggle in.  My obsession collection of books proves my vision. I totally have books from my childhood and books that I purchased in high school for my 'someday' kids. I have hundreds, maybe even thousands (and no, I'm not exaggerating) of books.  Shelves upon shelves, the attic and my work storing more.  Plus we frequent the library.  I'm so not a minimalist with books.  We read them though, I promise!  I am so thankful I have kids who enjoy reading with me. I don't think there's been a single day since either of their births that hasn't involved books. The days we're home, it's not unusual for us to spend 2 hours reading together. It's my favorite part of the day. No matter how busy we are, I try so hard to make lots of time for books. It's when I try to pinch myself and remember how lucky I am. It's the stuff I smile about as I drift off to sleep at night.  Thankful my husband snapped a couple cell phone pics of me doing my favorite part of parenting.  Our reading sessions won't last forever, so I'm going to remember to enjoy them each day."},

That's the honeycomb. And all those striped ones are the bees he cut out and drew.  100% his idea.  He spent three days making this.  You know, I'm a wee bit of a crafty gal. I used to bring my babysitting tote when I was a teen with all these craft ideas. I'd create with all the little kiddos I'd babysit.  I thought I would be the pinterest type mom, but I've come to a different realization as of late.  For me, what's even better than an adorable project from pinterest is the project that is planned and executed by little ones and their tiny hands.  It's actually not that fun doing pre-made ideas with Adrian in particular.  He gets so obsessed with the model and how his must look precisely like the model.  Then when each meticulous detail isn't a carbon copy of the original, he bursts into tears.  (Audra just does her own thing anyway....so she's no problem with anything structured).  On the flip side, when I just leave the art supplies out and let them create with no provided models by me, the creations are SO much better than planned projects.  For real. I have pictures of cows, mosquitos, Jesus on the cross and a lovely picture of Audra picking flowers from Adrian. Audra fills entire papers full of tiny brushstrokes of watercolors.  She also does tiny spirals and circles and then colors them in (on the wall too, sigh). I have all these Valentines with red hearts drawn on them in piles to make me feel cheerful. I have this house with bears in all the windows.  I have these hidden picture designs that you have to search to find the stickers hidden with all the elaborate pictures around them.  I have creations, creations and more creations.I sort of love my decision to just let them create. Multiple times a day, they head to their craft area I leave set up in the kitchen to create. Which is really the best way to go about things, yes?It's really a good lesson for me. When I feel like I need my mind to be a little better organized, I really ought to escape to my creative world, even for 5 minutes or so. When I feel my mind is cluttered (which is the case lately!), I tend to abandon my crafting stuff, which is the opposite of what I should do. I'm betting a little art interspersed into my day would do wonders for my tired brain.  Must get on that. More crafting.A good goal indeed."},

The deal of the century!  Or something like that. So, there's quite a story behind this.  At our homeschool co-op, there's a presentation day when kids get the chance to present whatever they want in front of a pretty big audience.  Adrian never has done any public speaking before, so I suggested a 'show and tell' of maybe his feed bag. As in \"Look what I made, any questions?\".  \"No mama. I'm a farmer. I want to teach everyone about cows.\" I tried to convince him otherwise, suggest other ideas. You know, a smaller project to start out.\"Mama. People need to know about cows. I'm a farmer. I'm going to teach them so they know.\" \"Okay, but if I sign you up for this, it's important that you work hard and practice. If you are going to pick something hard, you are signing up for hard work.  We're not going to sign up and quit.\" \"It's okay mama, I'm going to do it.\"Hard work he did do.  He spent an ENTIRE week making this elaborate poster. He was cutting things out right and left, gluing things here and there. The poster was mostly him, although I did guide him in labeling categories so it was more organized. He did practice too. For four days before the presentation, I encouraged him to practice.  He had different (family) audiences at the time, which was trickier than practicing just for his parents and sister. On go-day, he was nervous in the morning, but so excited.  He was super enthusiastic about setting up and loved standing up there...until it was go-time. And he didn't say a thing. I reviewed what he worked on and he stood next to me.  Of course told him that everyone loved his poster.Then when we got home, he was so sad. \"But mama, I just got scared and now no one even knows about farming.\"  I assured him it was okay.  It's hard to wrap my brain around what a mama should do in that circumstance.  I mean, it was his idea, he wanted to work hard and although I felt he was successful with making the poster and practicing,  it was hard on me that he didn't feel successful on presentation day.  But, we had an idea and made up for it.  He was stressed that no one knew about cows and I suggested we video and share the it so many can learn about cows. That was even better than presentation day sharing, as more could learn.  Turns out, he loved that idea.  You can watch that video here.  Also, on Thanksgiving, he did give the presentation in front of a big crew. They had a long question and answer session and Adrian knew almost all the answers!  They couldn't believe he could spout off the names of the cow's stomachs.  His interest is so intense. Anyway, here's the shirt I made for the big day.  Here he is with the outfit he chose for presentation day. Mama made cow undershirt, cow buttondown shirt and cow hat. He was rockin' the homemades.  And here he is ready for the presentation. Click HERE for the youtube video of his presentation.  ."},

Foster a community who enjoy spending time together enjoying simple pleasures. Even before we lived here, I always had this vision that this house would be a perfect gathering spot. A great place for kids to frolic, learn and grow and for people to come together. The necessity of using up this milk before it spoils encourages me to say \"Come\".  (Which happens to be my resolution anyway, read about that here.)And when I say \"Come\" and we gather here, my heart feels so full.  This place is meant to gather.  These are the memories children will have for an eternity.  And so it goes, no one minds being force fed homemade chocolate chip cookies anyway, so the milk is used up mighty quickly.

Any experience out there? Hints would be good!  Recipes appreciated!  Encouragement may be needed! I can learn this craft, right?!  The most overwhelming part is finding all the stuff I need without spending hundreds of dollars (which would totally be possible if buying new). I have no deadline in getting the ball rolling, but sometime before summer would be nice to get started. Might take me that long to collect all the thrifted stuff I need to get the job done.  Which is okay, as this homesteading thing is a process I've been committed to for over a decade now.  Learning the homesteading art is definitely at crockpot speech, not microwave speed, for sure."},

He was outside all summer long (This pic is from warmer days).  When it got cooler out, Miss Audra started toting Zip inside. This fall, we had that scare that he could hardly breathe.  We took him to the vet, inconclusive results. Verdict was he probably wasn't going to make it. Well, he made it, much to the vet's surprise.  The best guess is he was hit by a car.  A miracle cat.Today, he scooted outside first thing. He snuck right around the waters I was carrying out to the animals (No running water in our barn. Boo...) The wind was howling and catching momentum from all that open field, snow was being whipped this way and that. Bitter cold.  Zip definitely prefers to go to the bathroom outside, but he was no where to be found to come in after chores.  I hollered and hollered. Nothing. Usually my husband is home with the kids while I work on Wednesday mornings.  However, due to an uncooperative snowblower, my family had to go to buy a part.  If Zip came to the door to try to get inside, there was no one. When I got home from work, I hollered again and again for Zip. Nothing. So cold, so windy and a tiny little cat who didn't even have breakfast out there.  A cat who already had breathing problems.  Got me feeling guilty for being frustrated with the little guy for breaking two of my eggs this morning before chores. Knocked them clear off the counter. (Dogs were happy!)9:30pm, thought I'd try again. Said a little prayer. I went out to the barn and hollered.  I found him. Oh goodness, relief. I scooped him right up, popped him in my coat and snuggled for a few moments before bringing him inside. He probably couldn't hear all my cries for him with the noisy wind blowing my voice in the wrong direction.  He's home now. Safe and sound. Having his 3rd dinner, happy as can be.  He'll be snuggled in the most inconvenient spot momentarily. Hope that wasn't another of his 9 lives.  He's going through those lives too quickly, my heart needs a rest."},

However, it's not the New Year that gets me making resolutions. It's not even turning the big 3-5 that brings on the resolutions either. It's an anyday/everyday thing, this making resolutions business.  I'm always working on doing a little better than yesterday and learning a little more. Once I feel I've got a little room in my brain for one more resolution, off I go.  My previous resolutions in the past year were to become better at embroidery, improve the soil quality in the garden, figure out a good bbq sauce recipe for canning, use a broody hen to hatch chicks, figure out hand milking, make cheese/butter and create a homemakers group.  I've totally made progress in all of these areas! Not perfection, but progress.  Onto the next resolution.  I'll continue the others, but I'm adding.  I'll first share my weakness.  Our house is never up to my standards in clutter or in cleanliness.  Yes, I have kids. Yes, I have a big house.  Yes, I work outside the home too.  I'm not balancing it all well.  I'm just not measuring up to my own standards in this area.When we moved to this home, I saw such potential for it to be a gathering place.  I want a home open to all.  I want folks over for dinner, meetings to be held, playdates to be had.  I want this house to be more than just our house, but a place for our friends.  I've hosted a number of events here and had a lot of out of town company.  Through it all, I'm always working myself up trying to get things \"just so\".  I had a realization the last couple of weeks. Well, two actually.  I realized that no one  ever has said anything about the canning lids on the counter, the cob webs in the corners, the dust bunnies under the table.  Because they are just trying to be nice?  Likely not.  Likely they don't care. Because they didn't come to see my housekeeping skills.  They come to see us.  I also realized that it is me standing in my own way.  I want to have a gathering house.  But, if I get so wrapped up in the physical appearance of our home, I miss out on the PEOPLE.  People who never even notice the meticulous details I cannot ignore.   It's not worth the stress I cause myself.  So my resolution is to change.  Instead of saying in my head \"I'd invite if xyz was finished, but I just cannot until we finish\", I am instead saying \"Just come\".  Come to our home, we welcome you with open arms.  Come learn, play, grow, eat and have fun with us.  I know you don't even notice my imperfections, but I absolutely do, and I will choose to ignore them so we can have fun together at our home.  I'm so excited to say that between my husband, my kids and me, we've had 21 people over to our house since Tuesday.  And we'll have a big crew next weekend, it's already planned. Our home wasn't perfectly tidy, dusted or mopped.  But...it's warm by the fire. We have toys. We always have food. We have a comfortable place to sit and would love good conversation.  So just come.  My new resolution: I'm going to try my best to have a tidy guest welcoming area, but I'm not going to obsess over everything being just so.  I will have cookies.  I will have a smile.  I will turn off that voice in my head that says \"You can't\" and I'm going to replace it with \"You can\".  And I can, I'm sure I can. I can stop my focus of having a home 'just so' for the sake of sharing this space with friends.And so I say, Welcome."},

{"title": "So Long 2015", "date": null, "text": "As I was going through and reading yesterday's post, I noticed I made an error. It's not been four years of blogging but FIVE (!).  That's five years of me documenting just about daily.  You know what's crazy?  Blogging is a hobby I still enjoy.  I suppose I'm off to start year SIX (!) of blogging. Welcome 2016!  I'll be up, but not watching the ball drop, likely wrapping up whatever project of the evening I decide to focus on.  And putting the butter away, the buttermilk is dripping from it as I type. Fresh butter, mmm.Anyway, I also decided to include the recaps of years prior. Each year should be clicky if you want to stroll down memory lane with me.  Here's the previous years:2011201220132014And onto 2015: This would be year FIVE (!) of blogging for me.  It was FIVE (!) years ago when a friend suggested to me \"You should start a blog\".  So I did, with the intensions of documenting my children's childhood. My mom died when I was 15 and she left behind suitcases of pictures and oodles of notes of memories.  She meant to have them all organized, but got caught up in living the good life.  I'm so thankful she lived her life to the fullest, as I'm left with so many great memories.  This little blog of mine was a challenge  to myself.   A challenge to live the good life and document as I go.  A challenge I'm so glad I accepted.  I print my blog into fancy blog books, so my kids have these memories in a tangible way.  But, this blog has turned into so much more for me.   There are some days that are just....well....hard.  As it goes with marriage, children, jobs, house, barn, animals and life in general, some days it's hard to see the light. I'm not invincible to that, although I'd like to be. It's so easy for anyone to wallow in the negativity of the day.  That's not who I want to be.  Just keeping this blog helps me focus on the good in our life. I can begin and end my day with the celebrations instead of what went wrong. It helps keep me positive.  It helps me focus on who I want to be as a wife, mother, therapist , etc.  I do feel that I'm better in those roles often because I blog.  And also, this blog has turned into a such a support for me.  This desire to homestead has pushed me out of my comfort zone more times than I care to admit.  It has brought me to tears and tempted me to give up.  Many of you have seen my pregnancy announcements, know I am always begging my husband for just one more (he's not caving), seen me move to the farm, met all the animal additions,  watched my kids grow and made the recipes I've shared along with me.   I shared my celebrations and you have encouraged me.  I've gone out on a limb and shared my challenges and you've encouraged even more.  My soon to be sister in law asked me if I had community where we live.  Although I answered 'yes', we do indeed have local people who we could call in a pickle for help, it also made me think of how fortunate I am that I have a blogging community who are also my support. So, I thank you, dear readers for being on this journey with me. I thank you for looking for the good. I thank you for inspiring me and encouraging me.  I thank you for always wanting tomorrow to be better than yesterday.  I thank you for that desire to learn.  In a busy world, you could get sucked into any other media you so choose, but instead, you join me to enjoy the simple pleasure in life.  Because really, isn't that what life is all about? I encourage you to share this blog with someone who you think might enjoy it.  Not because I get anything tangible out of it (I most definitely do not get paid to blog, maybe someday?!), but because I have this vision of the simple life and the joy it brings encompassing thoughts more frequently than keeping up with the Joneses.  So please share, I will do my best to bring more joyous smiles and stoiries.In the year 2016, as I blog about my joys, accomplishments and goals, I challenge you to do the same.   Begin and end your day with thinking of the good in your life.  In fact, I think that's the perfect resolution to have for 2016. May it be the year of endless goodness in your lives, minds and hearts. And now, I bring you (a few too many pictures of)  the happiness of 2015."},

He has passed away.).  Both indoor cats back in the day.  We wanted to do something about the mouse situation in the barn and set off to get a barn cat.  Then we got Zoom. Zoom was always an indoor/outdoor cat at his previous foster care home and is the same here. (Can't keep him in!). And then Zip found us. He just moved into the barn and Audra ended up bringing him inside.  So now we have two cats who do everything possible to get outside by day and do everything possible to get in at night.  I must say that I love having them around outside. We randomly find them in places as they run up to us for a little scratch or snuggle.  Just seeing one sprawled and sunning himself makes our place seem so much like home. And Audra, our cat lover.  Where there's a cat, there's our Audra. A good chunk of her day is spent smothering...err....snuggling the cats.  (I cannot believe they do not run from her!).Shall we play a little game of \"I spy?\".  Or \"Can you find the cat?\" Oh, and that kitty dress.  I posted a pic when I finished making it, but never posted one with my model.

We were a part of the \"Golden Starts\" club.  I started as soon as I was old enough and was in the club until my mom was too sick to keep it going.  It's where I developed friendships, learned my skills, found my passions and gained confidence.  I put all my fair money in the bank as a kid and that money paid for us to elope and get married nearly 10 years ago!  I always knew I wanted to get our kids involved in 4-H. I'm so thankful for the 'Nature Kids' club and the awesome crew, who let us come aboard before we could officially be registered. We've had 2 years of attending and participating and now gearing up for year 3, Adrian can finally officially join.  What's really neat is our kids are 3rd generation 4-Hers, as my mom was a 4-Her as a kid as well. We just had the annual 4-H achievement night, which is so different from the achievement nights we had as a kid ( swimming and ice skating...in the same night).  I really like the event for our local group...they got to choose three classes, then pizza and then awards.  Fun times with our 4-H 'family'. So here's my little plug for 4-H.  If you haven't looked into it for your kids/grandkids, I recommend doing so. It's not just a 'club', it's a way of life. It's about learning the skills that are no longer taught in schools. It's about finding passions, learning new things, working with your hands and falling in love with learning. It's a big piece of what has made me who I am today. And now I bring you pine pillows, paper snowflakes, penny auction winnings, the randomness and silliness that comes from a little sister heading up on stage with big brother (which at least she looks cute in her mama made dress) and his achievement.Long story short. We love 4-H."},

Happy to report that today was not only an excellent animal day (everyone cooperated and stayed where they were supposed to be), but also the best milk day for her ever. I feel like I just used 4 gallons of milk to make cheese and there's 4 more gallons in there. Challenge accepted, Ophelia.  (Recommendations anyone?)Oh, and about this homesteading thing, the good is winning.  Farm on....Truth.Today I cried.  My night last night was later than I had planned, little ones up in the middle of the night and I was up before the sun for chores.  Not that that scenario is atypical for me. It's actually quite typical.  It's what happened next that turned my day into a not so great one.I put Ophelia, our milk cow, out to pasture like usual and turned around to get the calf.  By the time I was back, she had already pushed her way out of the fence.  This has happened twice before and I should have known to put her right in the barn. But no, I was trying to hurry to get to work and I just put her back in the fence. Shortly after, she escaped again and broke the fence in the process. ( I think she's mad that I didn't move the fence to new grass today. I did move it yesterday before work, but didn't have the daylight to move it again after a 10 hour workday. The newer pasture isn't bare either, Ophelia just had other plans.)  This time though, she thought she'd sprint around our yard. I hollered to the kids to get their dad, praying and sprinting from here to there after those cows by myself. And then TO THE ROAD they thought they'd go. Its an absolute miracle I got them both from the near road to the barn by myself.  I came in the house crying. I was part relieved, part releasing my fear, part upset at my husband because he never came to help, part because I don't know if having them is too much. It's a love/hate thing, doing it all on my own.  To be honest, although most days I love this lifestyle, there are other days that I feel so incredibly defeated.  Regardless,  I somehow managed to not be late to work.  I don't' think my heart has recovered from that scare. Ophelia spent the day in the barn. She earned herself a time out, that's for sure.  It was at the end of the day and I was doing a half of a dozen household tasks in the kitchen when I heard my little guy say, \"Mama, I know you had a hard day. I'm going to help.\"  He decided to do the rabbit cage. There was rabbit bedding everywhere.  Just what I needed...another mess. \"Don't worry mama, I'll take care of it. I'm a farmer.\"You know, he did clean it all up. He actually did a fantastic job.  No matter what obstacles Adrian faces, he keeps farming on.Moments like this makes me do a 180. It's so easy to get down in the dumps when problems arise. I need to pick myself up and remind myself that we sometimes have bad days.  But bad days are just a day with a beginning and end, they don't need to define future.  Do I want to continue this homesteading life? Absolutely  One bad day won't stand in my way.  We may or may not always have a cow,  but I imagine I'll keep going with the from scratch food.  Today I'm not discouraged, I won't let myself.  Onward I go. (And if you could keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I am so hopeful those cows will stay in the fence)."},

It is so crazy that this garden looked like this August 8th. And now, slipping into the Maine tundra time, it looks a bit more barren. Every couple of days, I've been adding another wheelbarrow of manure to it.  Plus I let the cows out there to graze.   No gardening year is without it's share of headaches/trials, but all in all, it was a pretty good year.  Last year with the junky soil and not dedicating too much time, I stopped weighing the produce when fall hit, at 250 pounds.  This year, after 7 truckloads of horse manure and four truckloads of grass clippings as mulch, I more than doubled the yield.  I stopped counting at 700 pounds.  That's 700 pounds of food that I have brought from the garden to my kitchen for preserving/canning/consuming.  Might not seem like a lot to some folks, but it is a celebration to me.  I'm a day job working, farming, hand milking, homeschooling mom of two and I managed to grow (mostly from seed!) 700 pounds of food that directly feeds my family.  Feels a bit victorious.   Still growing out there are collard greens, a whole bunch of volunteer plants. Plus volunteer peas.  Probably won't end up with any peas before the snow, but it's fun watching something grow out there.  Plus lots of kale. And parsnips. I love parsnips. Brussel Sprouts too. Most things have been pulled. It's crazy that the compost on the left looked exactly like the one on the right last year. That whole pile broke down to just that much soil.  Pretty remarkable, isn't it.Oh, and there's Zip. He seems to be doing AOK. I love his company in the garden. Another project is the hedge. I want to clear it back so I can put a permanent fence along the line.  There's years of growth.

{"title": "Home Sweet Home", "date": null, "text": "To think that yesterday, I was so frustrated with this homestead that I cried my eyes out. Today I think home sweet home is the most relaxing place to be. What  a range of emotions over the weekend. I'm up too late, cleaning a kitchen that is bound to be a disaster in no time tomorrow.  The to do list to get ready for winter is longer than my brain can be at peace with. Given commitments and work schedules, it feels unlikely to be completed anytime soon.  My kids' cooperation (or lack thereof) tells me they have been too scheduled as of late. I have so many sewing projects I really want to finish. Clutter is accumulating faster than I get at it. I had a really rough day with the menagerie of animals living on our farm.  These thoughts, they really pile up, don't they? I'm usually the eternal optimist, but sometimes it's unfortunate those gloomy thoughts sneak up and multiply. And so, in my moments of weakness, I bought a frozen pizza.  My mind was on rapid fire as I gave myself the guilt trip for such an unnecessary purchase.   It's not healthy.  We just had Halloween, we don't need more junk. I can make it for cheap and it would be healthy if I made it. We have so much homemade cheese that needs to be used up... Yet I put that pizza into the cart.Why do I put so much pressure on myself? Why do I allow that guilt to set in?  A pizza is such a silly thing to feel guilt over. But no matter who you are, the feelings of negativity and guilt surface at times and are hard to squelch.  They just creep up and linger.Sometimes I forget my mind is stronger than all that negativity. So tomorrow, I'm going to decide to change it up. I'm changing everything, starting with my thoughts. We're staying home. We're only doing the to do list if we feel like it. We're going to craft. We're going to eat frozen pizza, maybe even on paper plates (gasp).  I'm staying out of the kitchen. We're going to use that extra hour to make us feel more grounded, a peace and content.   Sometimes my bounty is 100% homemade/homegrown.  Sometimes it's not.  Sometimes the bittersweet from our woods and the other half gorgeous store bought daisies blend together perfectly. .

{"title": "On Having a Milk Cow, Part 5", "date": null, "text": "A bunch of you have asked me to tell more about having a milk cow. If you missed part one, here it is.  Part two is here, part three here, Part 4.So, what's it really like day to day?  It's a big responsibility and commitment.  One needs to rise early and milk at the same time, 7 days a week. No skipping. There's manure, fencing, money, feed, hay and gallons upon gallons of water. There's vets and breeders and all this extra stuff that I never even thought about. Plus time. Very time consuming. Definitely ties you down.There's been some people, family and friends, who have voiced their opinions about my choice about having a milk cow and really a homestead in general. Some not so supportive comments. Those comments stem from only thinking about the work.  Let me offer another side...I wake in the morning, before the sunrise.  I gather my upcycled wipes, washing water and buckets and open the door to breathe the morning air. There may be dew on the ground or frost on the ground, it may be hot and sticky or below freezing. Regardless, I roll out of my bed and start my day outside. It's a new day and I greet the new day with a deep breath of fresh air in the stillness of a new morning. Most often, I have little 'helpers' accompanying me. On the rare occasion, I somehow glide down the creaky old stairs unnoticed, and face the morning alone.I enter the barn and the chickens are just waking, scurrying around. Hop, the bunny is hopping about the barn. A cat may be strutting his prized catch. The goats are still huddled in the corner, resting.  But the cows? They are up and eagerly awaiting a morning forehead scratch.  It's like a non verbal morning announcement: \"So glad you're here\". After the other animals are tended ,my muscles get a morning workout scooping manure. When all is clean, I sit in my 'office space', my milking stool, and begin my morning milking.  Most often, I have one or both of my littles with me. Occasionally, it's just me, all alone.When it's just me, I have the most awesome time of thinking.  My mind is clear, it's so quiet as I am stuck in one place, filling a bucket.  I think, I pray, I plan, I organize, I dream.  I unclutter my mind, sort things out and become a better mother/wife. It's only happened a few times, that I've been alone for an entire milking, but I remember those times fondly.Most of the time, if my littles didn't join me first thing, they bust into the barn while I'm still milking.  They roll out of bed, throw on boots and perhaps a coat and go from their bed to outside to find me.  I tell you, there's nothing like being mid milking and a messy hair kid with pajamas and barn boots bursts into the barn with a big smile, looking for a hug.  Even though it's great to have morning alone time, I love when they join me.  When they do, they get an extended period of time of me sitting right at their level.  They hang on me, sit with me, hug me, talk to me. I answer questions, have conversation, plan for today and dream about tomorrow.  I participate in their elaborate pretend play schemas while milking, as of late it's been 'playing entering animals into the county fair'.  Prior to the milk cow, I didn't find it easy to give uninterrupted time to my kids consistently daily for an extended period of time. Chores, the kitchen timer, the phone or an animal always distracted me.  It's now built into the rhythm of our morning.   They know the can count on me to be their listening ear, play partner, question answerer, mama with nothing interrupting that time.  I swear they are better kids when it comes to cooperating with one another and with me when they spend the morning with me in the barn. It just is working so well for us.Long story short, I'm thankful. I'm thankful for this milk cow and how she ties me down and keeps me home. It keeps me grounded.  I'm thankful my kids roll out of bed and head outside everyday, no matter the weather. How awesome of a childhood is that?!  I'm thankful for time for me and time for my kids having a milk cow provides.  I'm thankful for the manure for my garden and milk for our family. I'm thankful to just look outside and see them grazing. Having them makes this homestead complete. It's really so much more than the work and the milk. It's the lifestyle, the slower rhythm, the time to breathe while doing the work. It's the happy memories that we are creating that my kids will hopefully one day lovingly recall as \"their childhood\". It's really quite good having them."},

He meant 1:1 time.  When he gets home from these events sans mama, he needs time to do one of two things: Set up his play farm or do his farming art.  Today was his farming art. Have I ever told you about his farming art?  He saves everything. Everything. Well, everything that has a tractor, cow, barn, windmill, antique car, barbed wire, grain hoppers, etc.  Clippings from butter containers.

He says these books are to go through when we want to feel happy because he gets happy looking at them. Today I left the kitchen a mess and made a little time to do his art with him.

I've made grape a bunch of times before.  Grr. Just as I was going to break the seal and try again, my kids asked if it could be for pancakes. Grape syrup for pancakes? Why not?  So, that's what we did.  And that's what we shall do for all 14 pints, so they declare.  Homegrown goodness.  We all love it.Oh, the pumpkins. Glad I grew so many sugar pumpkins, I am.  But now to use them up.  Adapted this recipe from here.  I basically am in love with the outcome of this recipe. So good.  Make a double batch, I recommend!  Pumpkin Chocolate Brownies1/2 cup butter, softened1 1/4 c. sugar1 tsp vanilla3 eggs1/2 tsp baking powder1/2 tsp salt3/4 c. flour 1/4 C. cocoa powder1/2 C. choc chips1/2 C. pumpkin puree1 tsp cinnamonpinch ground clovespinch nutmeg                                        1) Mix butter, sugar, vanilla. Add eggs. Add baking powder, salt and flour.  2) Divide batter in 2 bowls. In one bowl, add the cocoa powder and chocolate chips. In the other batter, add pumpkin, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.3) Pour a layer of chocolate in greased 8x8 pan,  keeping 1/3 of batter in bowl. Pour all pumpkin on top of chocolate. Dot the rest of the chocolate on top of the pumpkin.  Even the top and/or swirl the batter with a knife or spatula. 4) Bake at 350 for 40-45 min."},

Thankful that there's more trees on this old farm to play with. This one is closest to our house out of all the apple trees I've found on the property. I think I've found 6 so far.  I spent a good chunk of the day in February 2014 and a good chunk of the day February 2015 pruning, trying to keep from freezing, sporting a pair of snowshoes.It was a gamble at the time.  \"Am I wasting my time?\" I recall saying to my husband.  In August, Audra tried an apple. Gross. We tried again just last week. Totally edible now!  Not super sweet, but sweet enough! They are small, but there's TONS of them. I barely touched the bounty, bringing in 49 pounds. I let the chickens have a go too, they've been loving it. I've also seen the deer come by.  I need to make time to go out there and get more.  (Working on the grapes now. Hard to find time for everything!)Regardless, seeing the apples galore feels like a victory. We have more apple butter than we'll use this year and we have some applesauce too.It's a little deceiving to post this series of pictures. You can scroll through and see the pruning, the spring blossoms, the bounty, the prep, the kitchen time and the result in less than 30 seconds.  The fun and the glorious moments.  But what you miss is the oodles and oodles of hours in between.  Certainly not a quick hobby by any means, but it's one that gives my family oodles of homegrown/homemade/organic goodness.

{"title": "Extension Homemakers", "date": null, "text": "I randomly stumbled upon the \"Main Extension Homemakers\" page. What's that?! A club for those interested in homemaking type stuff!  I found out there was a club in our town.  Word was they were all two generations older than me, but that isn't something that would bother me (it was the same when I was a member of quilt club years ago). I contacted them and they unfortunately meet while I work. It got me thinking...how neat would it be to have a club with members of my generation?   Support, advice, mentorship, encouragement, inspiration and knowledge other than google...how awesome could that be? Last week, an overseer of the program met with me at my house to outline what it entails. The more I know, the more I want to do it.  Plus, the entire group as a whole is an aging population.  Getting the younger ones in will make sure some of these arts aren't dying.So, what's a homemaker?  A person, especially a housewife, who manages a home. (Google)What's a house wife? A housewife is a woman whose main occupation is running or managing her family's home—caring for and educating her children, cooking and storing food, buying goods the family needs in day-to-day life, cleaning and maintaining the home, making clothes for the family, etc.—and who is generally not employed outside the home. (Wikipedia)Yes, it sounds very back in the day type thing, but I am going to assert it doesn't have to be that way.  Because getting together, we'd be not yesterday's homemakers, but \"Modern Day Homemakers\". Who are Modern Day Homemakers? Maybe working moms who want to make healthy meals in the crockpot. Or maybe stay at home moms who want to start a garden. Perhaps women who want to learn how to sew, knit, crochet or hook rugs.  Maybe women who want to do some woodworking and build some furniture. Could be women who tend animals and can their produce. Could be single women who are interested in making their own soap or household cleaners. Or the married woman who wants to learn how to bake bread.Modern Day Homemakers are all inclusive. All types of people are welcome to join. From the single apartment dweller to the one who is fully engaged in a running farm. What we all have in common is the desire to learn in order to do just a bit better for ourselves and families. It's not a competition. It's a place where asking questions is okay.  A place where we all can help one another along.Can't you see it?  Canning parties. Seedling swaps. Sharing perennials.  Chicken keeping 101.  Quilting bees. Fiber groups. Classes, learning, mentorships.  So many possibilities..  So, tell me local Southern Mainers...would you like to attend an informational meeting?  I was thinking for those who are interested, we could take a poll to see when would be best.  I also don't want this to be 'one more thing', I want it to be fun for all of us!  Usually groups meet 8-10 times in a year, so not super overwhelming.  Please share with a friend who also might be interested. Send me a message to let me know if you'd be interested in learning more.If you're not local, might you consider starting one too? We can be sister clubs!  I think it's about time we let google rest a bit and go back to learning from each other."},

Talked about tails all the time.  He'd talk himself to sleep like this \"Mama no no tail. Kamkam tail es (yes). Dada no no tail. Pap no no tail. Harley tail es (yes)...and on he'd go through all his favorite people/animals, saying \"no no tail\" or \"es\" for \"yes\".  And then he'd repeat. It was the cutest thing ever.  He'd see people and check to be sure they didn't have a tail.  Adorable.  Back then, I made him a tail. He LOVED it and wore it all the time. So I made him a set. Four tails. After he got dressed, he'd pick a tail. Everyday. It was his fave accessory. He had four tails but would only wear 3/4 of the tails.  He made me wear the elephant.  Which I suppose was a tad fitting, as I was very pregnant at the time. I did go to the grocery store during that time with an elephant tail.  Sleep deprived a weee bit and wearing tails to random stores.  Cute when you're 19 months, not so cute when you're 30+. Anyway, it made me supper happy to get that tail picture. I went searching for more.  I'd love for them to make a comeback.

Most often with my littles coming along for the ride, one very helpful, the other climbing something dangerous.  At the end of the day today, I have my fridge full of milk and eggs, feta setting on the counter, leftovers of a homemade/homegrown meal for dinner, homemade cookies for dessert and lots of poundage of food to preserve when I have a minute.  It's a busy life, yes.

He keeps saying' I can do that, I'm five'.  He has told our neighbors no less than a dozen times that he's five. They know. Out of town family happen to call and he tells them too, \"I'm' five.\"  They know. We all know. He keeps reminding us. We know. If this is what age 5 brings, I love it.True to his very favorite things, he got a John Deere pickup with cows to haul, a combine, 2 John Deere tractors, John Deere puzzles, some John Deere shirts and cow shirts that are bigger than size 4, so will fit for a bit.  Plus overalls. He loves overalls.  Most talked about gifts? John Deere sheets and a \"just my size\" pitchfork.  So he can scoop manure, of course. He tells everyone about those two gifts in particular.  Thankful for grandparents who embrace who he is and get him the farming stuff that makes him smile so so so big.  And thankful for his menu. Easier than it could be. PBJ. Chips and dip. Grapes. Apple cider. Apple crisp (no cake, just crisp.  Just his favorites. Most of all, we're thankful he's five and will be for a whole year. Happy age 5, Adrian."},
{"title": "Lucky.", "date": null, "text": "Right about now is about that time of year that I start to feel like I've really had enough of this preserving thing.  So much to do day after day. So many messes, jars, scraps. Plus I'm trying to figure out this surplus milk management. It's taking over my \"spare\" time. I think I spend more time in the kitchen than I do in my bed! I went to add some more applesauce into my canning storage and just looked at what I've done thus far.  No wonder I'm tired.  There's a lot down there. I never really looked at what I did, I just fired up the canner and then shoved on a shelf.  Really, I'm not trying to complain. I feel blessed, really blessed!  This is what I want too.....all this homegrown love that my littles can grow up on.  It's just that I won't be sad when there's nothing left to process and I can just sit at my sewing machine and hum away during my spare minutes. And someday I hope to carve out a little time to use all these 4 leaf clovers.  A random 'talent' I have is spotting 4 leaf clovers.  Ever since I was young, I spot them right and left, not even looking for them!  If  I do find one, I sometimes look right and left to see if it's a lucky spot. Usually not, though. Usually there's just one four leaf clover. Not today though.  I looked and hit the jackpot. I got all of these in just a couple minutes.  It's been since I was a kid that I'd have a haul like this.  Mostly in my cookbooks, you'd find hundreds of four, five and six leave clovers, pressed and waiting for a project.  Tell me, what would you create with a surplus of 4-leaf clovers?!  And tell me you're a little bit tired of canning, freezing and dehydrating too."},

{"title": "On Having a Milk Cow: Part Three", "date": null, "text": "A bunch of you have asked me to tell more about having a milk cow. If you missed part one, here it is.  Part two is here.Part three. Milking. I grew up in a farming community. My mom grew up on a dairy farm. I have family members earning their livelihood as farmers. My dad is a large animal veterinarian. I lived on a hobby farm with cows. I learned a lot about how to judge a quality cow through 4-H. All that and I somehow made it my whole childhood without filling a bucket hand milking. Sure, I tried it a time or two. Just a squirt or two to figure out how to make the milk come out.  But I never hand milked for real.Hand milking is one of those things that you cannot learn from books, internet searches, youtube videos or advice from others. You learn it through your own struggles.That first day I don't think I'll ever forget. It was hot, humid. I was up early with our two kids and a fresh air kid. Everyone wanted to help. Everyone was loud and going crazy, likely from the excitement of the whole hullabaloo.  I was trying to not get kicked or stepped on as the cow moved constantly. I was trying to not squirt myself in the face and trying to get the milk in the actual bucket. I was trying to prevent the bucket from being tipped over too, all while monitoring kids' behavior and dealing with the switch of the cow's tail smacking me in the face every second.  I was out there an hour and a half. An HOUR and  A HALF. And I had hardly anything to show for it. \"Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.\"  That was my mantra I said to myself. \"You WILL get this.\"  I mean I adopted a milk cow, for crying out loud. I HAD to get this.  Next day, I was thinking I was doing better. And then she kicked the bucket. Whoever said \"Don't cry over spilled milk\" surely wasn't the one out there hand milking as the sun rises, watching as your hard work runs rapidly out of the bucket, a steady stream right into the gutter.  I did cry a bit in those early days. Not just because of the milk situation but also because my kids totally weren't themselves. They are so used to getting up with me, regardless of when I wake. The second my foot hits the stair, I hear \"mama!\".  I had to leave for work at 7:30 am and was getting up at 5:30am.  They weren't going to be any earlier. We were all exhausted.I never really got discouraged. I have this eternal optimism quality (which can be annoying at times). I always believe it would work out.  Slowly, I figured things out.I don't have to get up every few minutes now, my body is used to sitting cramped on that little milking stool.  My hands are so much stronger, I have milking muscles now. And I've got the rhythm of milking.I now tie her tail to her leg so I'm not smacked in the head constantly with that switch.I can aim like you wouldn't believe now.  That bucket can be half way across the barn and I can squirt the milk right in there. I now know what true letdown feels like (which I didn't before, I think my struggles in the early days were because she never fully let down).  Probably controversial, but I let the calf on to give me that letdown quickly.  I still dump the bucket everytime I have a quart or so in case she kicks the bucket, but she really doesn't anymore.  (Knock on wood). Having the kids in there talking to me helps too. Calms us all. The hour and a half of milking has turned into well over a gallon in 30-40 minutes (That's with getting up a time or two to check on my littles). I've only been at this for 2 months now, so I still have room to grow.I have also tried simple, non expensive machine milker.  While a tricky beginning, I have gotten it to work now. Only it isn't really my thing, the machine milker. Nor does Ophelia prefer it.  It's good to have a backup in the event I am unable to milk for a day.Do I dread milking? No. I don't.  I really don't mind getting up early and heading out during the crisp air with the new sunrise to that warm barn to spend my morning.  Is it my absolute favorite thing to do? No. (That would be sewing!).  It's sort of like doing laundry or washing dishes or cooking or gardening to me. Not how I'd spend my whole day if I had the choice, but something that I enjoy enough to do for my family because I love them. I'm just glad she has her calf still, as I think I would be overwhelmed with milking more than once a day with all other commitments (work in particular). So am I glad we have a milk cow now? Yes, I am.  I enjoy looking out my kitchen window and seeing the duo grazing.  I love when I come home, she bellows for me. I love that she turns to her name. I love that my kids have this experience.  I love that she runs for me as I approach the fence. I love that I have halter trained them. I love that having them makes our homestead feel complete. I have been learning so much about using milk to make things with all my excess. But that?  That's another post entirely. Be watching for that one."},

You know what you like. You know what you want. You are unwavering. All these are such strong points for you and also the tricky parts of parenting you sometimes. You love, love, love farming. Some thought it was a phase when you were young. It's no phase. You live, eat, breathe and sleep farming. Literally. Tractors and cows mostly.  You sleep with a John Deere stuffed cow. You wake up, roll out of bed and go directly to the barn.  You put on some sort of farming apparel to begin your day, you never go a day without wearing something farming related. Your play is emulating farming scenes with your play tractors and cows or doing some sort of job you create for yourself around the farm (moving sticks, gathering grass, etc.). The things you want to do are farming related. You are forever striking farming conversations up with whoever will listen.  Work and play are the same to you, as work is your play. It's really quite entertaining listening to the stuff you rattle on about.You are the most helpful and dependable little boy. You do chores without being asked (empty the clothes line, for example) and always clear your plate. If there is work to be done, you are there. You never lie. You are always truthful.You love PBJ and apple crisp. Any fruit dessert is up your alley. You love carbs, especially the end piece of homemade bread.  You appreciate anything that is homemade. You'll usually try anything. You love to help make anything and everything. You are not a fan of sports.  You hate doing anything without your mama.  You love your mom and your dad, but your mama is your world. You see little point in playing with toys that are not farming. You love the Tractor Supply and the Feed Store. You are usually good at including and playing with new friends. You love your sister and get along really well with her.You love to be homeschooled.  You hope you're always homeschooled. Your academics are coming although there's plenty of time for that later. Right now, you don't mind being home all day, just playing and helping your mama. You are never bored and seem to love your childhood. You, sweet boy, are a joy each and every day to us. We love you oodles and are excited to have a five year old in  our farmhouse. So much love we have for you! Happy Birthday, Adrian! Love, mama.

I'm \"Farmer Superhero\", I can do superhero things around this farm! I have to go and be the Farmer Superhero! There's so much to do!\"Off he went. I  have no idea what sorts of things require a Farmer Superhero around these parts, but he is most convinced we need one.  It's quite time consuming stuff, there must be lots of work.  It involves lots of running and hollering. I heard the word \"save\" muttered a few times too.  Oh, and this work required a sidekick.   He got the closest thing to his cape for her, a zebra silk.  We can all just pretend it's a cow, so I told him. He liked that idea. It seems that there is no farming scenario that is too big for this duo! They are brave, fast and helpful for the farmers! There's so much to do!I really ought to hire them out.  Everyone could use a superhero to help them out (and perhaps a little entertainment from them as well). Let's chat about housewives. Definition: A housewife is a woman whose main occupation is running or managing her family's home—caring for and educating her children, cooking and storing food, buying goods the family needs in day-to-day life, cleaning and maintaining the home, making clothes for the family, etc.—and who is generally not employed outside the home. (Wikipedia)All this is what I do...well except I do work outside the home too.  It's stuff that no one asks/makes/requests me to do , it's what I enjoy. It's so sad to me that this term has sometimes become a condescending label. \"Just a housewife.\"  Pft. In my eyes, \"a housewife\" should be celebrated.  Keeping those 'old fashioned' arts alive-very important. Caring for one's family? What could be more important?I'm celebrating the housewife in me by shopping, apparently. I've been trying to keep my eyes out for fun aprons.  Exhibit one: Two flip top jars, a vintage pyrex, an apron and Born shoes. $10.00Exhibit two:Two vintage books, a mug for morning goodness, an apron and Born shoes. $10.00(Totally not related to housewifeness, Born shoes...what a love I have for them. They are well over $100 shoes and fit oh-so-perfect after they are broken in. I currently have 8 pairs, all thrifted in like new condition. Do I need 8 pairs? Absolutely.  Well, maybe not, but I do love them. I don't think most understand you have to break them in around the house before you wear them for a day.  I've spent $60 on 8 pairs total.  How about that?!  Plus, I found another pair for a dollar for my neighbor two weeks ago.  Love me some Born shoes.)Back to the Housewife in me... shall I bake you something?  Now, that being said, the second someone said it's 'woman's work', I'd be storming off in a huff and saying \"You do it\". Because I get to choose what I want to be, I will happily embrace that entire definition of being a housewife.  There's no better thing, really."},

I remember playing like this with my brother when we were  kids. I remember mostly when we were in these little islands of trees in the fields. We'd move rocks, organize sticks, clear paths. We had our whole life planned and in motion. Well, right up until we'd hear \"Jacqueline Marie, Matthew John....dinner!\"  That would be my mom, who used our full names when she hollered for us. While I usually opt to do something I need to do sans kids when they are playing so nicely, I really need to just stop and listen to them more often.  It is quite nice losing one's thoughts while becoming so engrossed with their life like pretend play. It's really too good to miss. Goodness, how did it get to be midnight?  It seems that the days just are zooming past.

{"title": "On having a milk cow... Part Two", "date": null, "text": "A bunch of you have asked me to tell more about having a milk cow. If you missed part one, here it is.We decided we definitely wanted the duo we met.  Ophelia and her calf, who we called Oliver.  Next step was getting the duo 2 hours south to us. We asked a bunch of friends, random strangers, the feed store. In the end the folks who we bought them from found us a driver.  You know, there's nothing like the flurry of excitement and nervousness floating around in our belly with these beginning stages. Am I crazy? When will we get them here? Where will we put them? Will I like having them? Are we capable of keeping them alive and thriving? Can I really milk everyday?  Do I have what it takes?  I thought I was working through the to do list in getting ready for them.  Only it all came crashing together the weekend of. I had brought my two kids and our fresh air kid to the store to get the materials needed for fencing. I had no idea what was needed to put a fence up. No one was available to help me, so I'm trying to read and figure out what I needed with overtired kids distracting me at 7pm. I did end up finding what I needed and had planned on putting up the fence that weekend. Only it also happened to be the same weekend that the farmer who hays our field decided to do his haying. Oh, it also happened to be just about the hottest day of the year. My husband hadn't slept in a full 24 hours (due to his job) and we were trying to figure out this fencing thing with our kids and  an extra little boy distracting us every 3 seconds.  I wanted to cry.  As it turns out, we just left the cows in the barn the first day and my husband did a great job putting up a small area for them to graze the next day. I guess this was my first lesson in the \"It's all going to work out\" book that we've been writing in our minds living in this farmhouse.  Anyway, the duo arrived and we all were just so happy.  Let me share with you my tidbits. -I about had a heart attack when the calf got out. -I got really good at lassoing a calf. -There's many parts to a fence and it's beyond frustrating when there's no electricity and you cannot figure out why.  -It's quite interesting leading a cow to pasture who doesn't have regular practice being led. -Hungry cows go through our little corralled pasture sooo quickly that the movable fence needs to be moved daily. (Cannot wait for a permanent fence!)-A woman can really surprise her husband, even after being together over a decade ,as he utters in disbelief \"I had no idea you could handle an animal like that.\"  -A certain three year old thinks the calf is her chair. -A certain 4 1/2 year old was caught a number of times that first week just looking at them and smiling. -I get home from work and they come running to the edge of the fence to greet me, often with a moooo. -I no longer have to lasso a calf.  He comes to me willingly now. (success!)-It's been me and only me who has taught these two to walk halter led. (And they both do beautifully now!)-My 2 kids roll out of bed and head directly to the barn, which how neat of a childhood is that?! Overall, their transition to our home has been a good one.  It really feels nice having this duo on this farm. In fact, there's a special place in our heart for this bovine love.Stay tuned for next time, I'll talk about milking."},

{"title": "His sewing projects and an Epic Picnic", "date": null, "text": "I tell you, this kid, he always has something up his sleeve. I was turning the cows out to pasture the other day. While I was doing that, he collected a massive amount of grain bags. 18 of them to be exact.  He decided he was going to make grocery store bags with them. He had plans to do 18 of them that day. Now, I'm beyond thrilled to do sewing projects with my kids and love to encourage any creativity. But, I don't even sew much myself this time of year! Harvest time we're out in the garden and kitchen.   Now as in today? Are you serious? Oh, so  serious.  And how cute is it?  He is thinking of making more and selling them for four bucks.

Doing pretty good so far! One down and 17 to go according to him.  After that work, it's time for a picnic/concert break anyway. Not my recipe, not my idea. It's just one of those recipes floating around facebook. Since I try to keep all the recipes I like here in this space so I can find them, I'm posting this here.  Recipe is from here. By the way, if there's a recipe that is posted here and you can't find it in the \"Recipe\" tab, it's because I stink at updating that tab.  To find one the recipes listed on this blog, go to \" google.com \" and type in my blog name and what you are looking for (ex \" born imaginative cookie cake\").  It will pop right up.The one thing I did change in this recipe here is I didn't put two sticks of butter for the frosting. That's a LOT of butter. One stick, confectionary's sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and vanilla and it worked fine. I listed the original recipe below, so you can choose. Blueberry Zucchini Cake with Lemon Buttercream3 eggs, lightly beaten 1 cup vegetable oil 3 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 1/4 cups white sugar 2 cups finely shredded and drained zucchini 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 pint fresh blueberries (you can reserve a few for garnish if so desired) Lemon Buttercream 1 cup butter, room temperature 3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 1 lemon, juice and zest of (about 2 tablespoons) 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon salt   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare two 8-inch round cake pans. Grate a large zucchini (or two small zucchini) and place in a clean dish towel.  Squeeze until most of the liquid comes out.  You will want to have 2 total cups of shredded zucchini after it has been drained.  Set aside. In a large bowl and using a hand mixer, beat together the eggs, oil, vanilla, and sugar. Fold in the zucchini.  Slowly add in the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Gently fold in the blueberries. Divide batter evenly between prepared cake pans.   Bake 35-40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean. Cool 20 minutes in pans, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely. Lemon Buttercream Combine butter, sugar and salt and beat till well combined. Add lemon juice and vanilla and continue to beat for another 3 to 5 minute or until creamy. Fold in zest*. *If you are piping this buttercream, I recommend leaving out the zest."},

{"title": "On having a milk cow... Part ONE", "date": null, "text": "It's been about a month and a half of having a family milk cow at this point.  I wasn't planning on going into the play by play of our experiences, but I have heard so many of you loud and clear. You want to know what it's like having a family milk cow. You want the play by play, the day by day. You want to know what it's really like. I'm still not sure what to say or even if I really feel like journaling our experience.  You see, this is all completely new territory for me.  It's already been a huge learning curve and the story really exposes my inadequacies. It's hard putting myself out there for things that I am feeling like a beginner. But this is life. This is homesteading. This is what I wanted and signed myself up for. So, I shall start the story of owning a milk cow. It will likely be in a gazillion rambling thoughts type of post/posts, so hang in there! Growing up, we had cows. Many beef cows.  I helped here and there with the grain, hay and sometimes the manure situation. I watched the breeder, attended births, helped with bovine escapees.  They were always fenced in adjacent to our farmhouse, I was comfortable with them, used to their gentle spirit and liked their mooing.  My dad was a large animal veterinarian growing up and we always went to the fairs. I did cattle judging as a part of 4-H. I have uncles, aunts, cousins who are dairy farmers.  I've been to their milking parlors a number of times.  While I tried out hand milking for a couple squirts, fact is, I never learned how to hand milk.  Never filled a bucket. My city boy husband had not a lick of experience with cows in general.  So I get the idea we'll buy a milking cow.  But then I think cows are big, let's try goats.  Repeated attempts of breeding our goats didn't lead to kiddings.  I didn't want to wait and try again with the goats, thinking that it would be another whole year of hopefulness and no kids and no milk. Every couple months, I would browse craiglist, looking for a cow.  Nothing felt right. I didn't want just any cow.  I  wanted another family pet. A cow that would be gentle and patient around kids. I came across an ad for this milk cow and her calf. This family was looking to rehome the mama/ calf duo. Something about that post just tugged at me.  I contacted sellers and they said they had other offers, but were holding out for the right match.  They suggested a meet and greet. We traveled a couple hours north for the grand introduction.  We arrived at the loveliest homestead. A homestead bursting with animals, surrounded with the loveliest of plants, with the three most wonderful homesteaders.  We met the couple and their son (who is the same age as Adrian) and had such a peaceful morning playing, chatting and meeting the bovine crew.  I left their house happy, hopeful and totally smitten. I was convinced the duo belonged with us."},
{"title": "Thoughts", "date": null, "text": "Sometimes readers asked me how I do it all. Let me tell you. I don't.I just cannot keep up. I am barely hanging on. Each time I use a bowl of tomatoes, I bring two more bowls in. I meant to use all that milk in the fridge, but I just haven't.  There's nearly five gallons of milk and over a gallon of cream. I spent an entire hour calling around looking for rennent and no one around here carries it. I'm laying on the couch and there's clutter everywhere.I've meant to make bread for the last five days and just haven't.The laundry is heaped. My husband asked me if I had plans for dinner and I hadn't a clue (which he was very good at helping with this!).  The garden is not even close to a show garden. There's more weeds than flowers in the flower beds. The fix it projects that I meant to do this summer haven't even been started. I feel guilty because my pets are overdue for the vet. Our dentist doesn't take our new insurance and we haven't been able to locate a local dentist who will take us.There's way too much clutter in the kitchen. And to top it off, my computer broke.I told you I don't do it all. I'm not usually someone who has the woes, but I do tonight. The truth is my woes have nothing to do with what I'm complaining about.  It has everything to do with this empty hole in my heart.  Our fresh air kid went back with her family and it feels so lonely here without her.  We grew to love her, she fit in perfectly and I miss that girl terribly.  Our week together was magical and there's always the possibility that we may never see one another again. That little girl is someone who anyone would be lucky to spend time with. She is the sweetest, most caring, thoughtful, kind and patient girl there is.  Just as I was thinking about her, she called to check in.  She just wanted to chat.  Yes, she has a mom who loves her, but she also has a summer family who cannot wait for her return.  Just hearing her voice, my heart smiles again.  No matter what, that girl will always have a piece of my heart."},

Or whatever suits your fancy.    Cost? This is our annual party for charity. Last year we helped set up some families in Africa with chickens. Year before we focused on helping foster kids. This year, my little farmers want to \"Help people who don't have good water or milk.\" So, we found that it takes $5000 to drill a well in a less fortunate country.  You can buy shares to contribute at $50.00 intervals.  We hope to contribute a share or two to help drill a community well.   Food?  We'll have lemonade, light snacks, as well as a couple desserts.  Bring your own drink and sandwich and plan to have a picnic with us.  Come anytime 3:30 and after. Stop by for a quick visit or stay for a bit. Come young, come old, and plan to have some fun!  It's a family event.  You can invite your friends! To see some fun from last year and year before, look here:  http://www.bornimaginative.com/2014/08/country-lovin-kids-2014-re-cap.html  http://bornambitous-bornimaginative.blogspot.com/2013/08/country-lovin-kids-2013.html  (If you could let me know you might stop by, that would help us plan.  Thanks!  And if you do come, please don't park on the road. In the driveway or drive around back of our house to the field.

{"title": "Corn", "date": null, "text": "I'm sort of a broken record. Every year, I always like to mark the beginning of corn season with some photos. I could go all the way back to finding their first ear of corn. It's a silly tradition in a way, but in another way, it feels like a good one. It celebrates the full, delicious and abundant gardens of August.  It's not our corn this year, but it's off the tractor with the full wagon of corn that goes by every morning while I'm out milking. Now the ideas are rolling-corn chowder, corn fritters, corn casserole...  Such a great part of August. The cows don't mind the scraps one bit, that's for sure. I really ought to keep the past years linked all together.  But that would require searching. I did find 2014 with ease, see it here. My, how they have grown! The blueberries are ripe. The ones in our yard are about gone (Audra), which is okay, as that's what they are for, right?  Alas, there's places to pick.  Look for the yellow balloons for the best picking they say. Big delicious handfuls of blueberries at those yellow balloons.  Adrian picked more than his dad.  Audra had an empty bucket, per usual.  Really, can you blame her? Why save for later when you can eat right now.  Blueberry rhubarb jam fresh out of the canner at 11:30 pm (some fresh salsa too!).  It sounded like something good to try. Mmm. It's good. I suspect a little fresh jam will be a welcome surprise come morning.  There's still oodles of blueberries left to gobble up. I suspect there will be some baking in the near future."},

{"title": "Mama Made: Tractor Collared Shirt", "date": null, "text": "My little Adrian seriously only wears clothes that are farming related.  He dresses himself 100% of the time and he pretty much never wears something that's not farming. He's so consistent on what he wears that I actually boxed and tucked into the closet many of his non farming shirts.  We are regular weekly church goers and my rule is no tractor shirts to church.  He knows he has to wear a collared shirt. He hates when he can't wear tractors. Enter a $2/yard bin while we were on vacation and the discovery of Blue Ford fabric. \"Mama, I have nothing that's Blue Ford!\"  And then enter this really great book I found for $6 at the tractor supply (and it includes all the tissue paper patterns!). And you end up with a blue ford tractor collared shirt.  Which is perfect for church, so he says.Would you look at that fabric? My. You must know that I really love him, given that I let him pick out that fabric AND made him a shirt with it.  That shirt? It's his new favorite. He wore it 3 days straight before taking it off.  Glad I can make him happy."},

I'm confident we'll surpass that given we haven't brought in all the tomatoes, potatoes, squash and pumpkins as of yet, and they can add the poundage! Each day I'm trying to make a homemade meal and preserve something. Lots of drying of kale and herbs and then canning and freezing whatever else I can do. My cabbage have always been so small previous years, much bigger this year! Although the tomato plants have blight, the majority of my tomatoes have been without much of a blemish.   Basil pesto is in the plan.  So far, the plants on the growing the potatoes in a box are bigger than the ones growing in the ground soil.  Not the best pic, but you see the mysteries we have.  All the squash seems like we've developed a new variety.  Kale. Our backyard. She does a lot of wandering and exploring.  He's still mulching. Bless his heart. They are mighty helpful.  My son is me. He organizes, has uniform cuts and saves the seeds for next year. The discovery of cucumbers and the pretend play that is inspired. Entertaining.  It was a baby here. But then a phone.  How I dried the oregano. I have a lovely jar filled with it dried in the kitchen now.  And the meals! (Yes, my kids eat this stuff.) It's not perfect, there's room to grow (pun...hehe), but I'm getting there. One year of improvements at a time. And you, how is your garden doing?"},

And truth be told, it's just unsweetened apple or pear juice I made in the fall.  I guess having it frozen makes it extra exciting. \"You want a popsicle?  Find a place to sit.  Sit down and eat it. If you get up, you're telling me you are all done. Find a cozy place to sit so you can enjoy it!\"Frequently I use the popsicle trick so that we all sit down and take in the summertime together.  It's always a great time to chat about our day, enjoy our time and have a few snuggles.Sometimes, it's popsicles that give me the extra 10 minutes to get that item crossed off the to do list.  I think I shall be using the popsicle trick today for the latter, not the former.  I'm so eager to be settled back into home sweet home."},

{"title": "More animals", "date": null, "text": "Remember when I said we were all done adding animals? Well, apparently I lied. I found this yesterday afternoon. You know, I'm never quite sure that the stuff we do will work. Apparently we have gotten down the hatching our own business.  We've done the incubator (even this year), but I have decided I much prefer a broody hen.  These are the ones born almost 2 weeks ago. They are already integrated into the flock, their mama as their protector.  They are super friendly and love to be held. Mama lets us with no troubles. The ones above are the 'older' ones. This one below isn't quite a day old yet.It's much, much, much easier having a broody. Some of these below are incubator chicks, so we have them in a separate pen.  I think I'm done with the incubator. It's nice having everyone all together. So, as of bedtime, there were 5 baby chicks peeping in this nesting box. It may not be the final count. We shall see tomorrow.    All together, I have 78 mouths to feed at current count (including all animals and people on this homestead). That's a lot.  And now, I'm done adding animals. (I think.) If you haven't noticed already, it's just a part of me to always have a table cleared off and topped with fresh flowers.  I always feel our place is a home with a clear table, a bouquet and transferware. I also love to tuck them into random nooks. I just about always have 2 vases, at minimum. Gathering the bouquets is something that I frequently do with my littles.  You know what's neat?  This guy has been noticing when they need to be freshened up.  He is the one who lets me know we need new flowers. He often picks some to display for me.  He always compliments my fresh bouquets. I just love that my hobby has become something he loves too. How special is that?!"},

It's so much harder for me to get the drive to get things done. And so, it's well after dark when the temperature cools when I finally get moving. Two loaves of pumpkin bread tonight and a frittata both out of the oven.  The pumpkin bread made with our own pumpkin, own eggs, own pears. The frittata our own milk, own eggs, own veggies, own herbs. And then I just snapped 10 pounds of beans.  It's nearly midnight when I sit down to blog and I have to get up at 5:30am tomorrow to milk.  Sometimes I wonder what my husband frequently wonders: \"What ARE you doing?\" And \"WHY?\"But, my family eats homemade/homegrown. I'm sitting on our screen porch listening to the crickets as I blog. My boots will get 'washed' on the way to the barn tomorrow morning as I step through the dew.  The first conversations I have will be first with our beloved dog, Kammie and then with Ophelia, our milk cow.  The kiddos will join me in the barn as they awake.  I'll eat my breakfast, already feeling like I accomplished something for the day.It's certainly a lot of work, even more so this time of year. But the work tends to lead to little snippets of joy that I may not have experience had I purchased our goods at the grocery store. And I get to smile when my kids say \"Mmm, this is so good!\"  And the good part of the heat?  We get to stop and relax for homemade popsicles midday.  That's something special that we don't do year round."},
{"title": "He Cooks", "date": null, "text": "Recently, Adrian said to me, \"Mama, can I go fill a bowl up for dinner?\"  What he meant was he wanted to gather a medley of finds from the garden to concoct into a dinner masterpiece.  Certainly, by all means.

Summer squash, kale, herbs, white beans, homemade cream of mushroom soup (I store that in the freezer for quick meal starters), rice, our own broth and our own milk. You know...it was really really delicious.  Who would have thought of that combo?  I guess Adrian. He also wanted to pick some flowers. PLus he helped make the bread.  Voila. A meal. Made (mostly) by a four year old.  He's really the best chopper out there.  He was so proud, he kept wanting his picture taken. He never wants his picture taken.  His dad said he thought this was the best soup ever.  And you know what? I don't think he was just being nice.

{"title": "Flea Market Love", "date": null, "text": "I fondly remember the days I'd venture to the Brimfield Flea Market. Certainly a trek from our home in Maine, but we'd meet my uncle and we'd all head there together.  I'd browse, search, ponder....and sure enough head home with stuff, stuff and more stuff. It's too long of a day for my littles to head to Brimfield, but we can at least pop into smaller/local flea markets.  There's still a lot of love there. Our loot: A four dollar big metal tub. The wooden tool box.  Vintage toys. Wool, lots of wool.   There's yards of wool here. You know how expensive that is? Wicked expensive. Pretty proud of myself. I found all the stuff I loved and asked her \"Would you take $15 for this?\"  It was a lot less than if I had tallied the price that she tagged.  I'm trying not to be scared to ask. Getting better at asking, which is good, as she agreed. And look at these vintage toys.  Adrian always loves 'rusty old'. He'd much rather go to the flea market for toys than a department store. That makes my heart soar!  She just loves tiny tiny, no matter where you get it. A quarter a piece makes me happy.  Who knows what this rusty bin was for, but I say it's good for keeping children. Not bad for $4.00   I was pretty stoked to find the tool box. It's because I've already started a wooden tool box collection.  This is round 3 of them.  $2.00 for the last one I bought. The cost of all  was $5.50.  I filled them with the garden necessities (thanks for grammy and grampy for the shoves, glaves and the like).  One box for me and each of my littles.I'd say they approve."},

A job with many steps and close attention to detail. Onto the next task...It's not us who is in charge of the haying, but the bigger farm operation seems to parallel our little farm life. So much to do in not enough time. The changes as of late are sort of like having a newborn with no maternity leave from work.  A hired hand would be useful.Such is the summer season and the season of new beginnings.  There will be a time when things settle a bit.

And the learning curve. The big learning curve.  I guess I wasn't sure how much the world wants to hear about our adventures of owning a family cow. While I continue deciding how much to write on this adventure, I can at least show some pictures. The heart on Oliver's head is something special. They are settling into their new space quite nicely (thankful this barn was made for cows!).  I've been up bright and early to milk. I've been trying to figure out how to use all this milk. I've been thankful, overwhelmed, happy and stressed. All the emotions, surely. But mostly? The decision to add these to our farm feels right. She's quite happy. As is he. Although he's mostly all business.  There's a lot to do owning a milking cow and calf.

They are a perennial. they get heavy at the tip, bend over and replant themselves.  So neat! A friend gave some last year.Sure, there's weeds that need to be cleared an a to do list every time you turn around. I'm at 67 pounds of food that have been harvested from here.

He said I could clean them up. \"It's childhood, why can't they get dirty when they are just home?\" I said to him.  My friend was getting rid of the metal potato bin for free. I found the typewriter cart for $3.00. My uncle gave me the wire hanging basket. My dad cut the stump table and chairs a while ago. I have been collecting free or cheap metal things for them to use.  Most were a quarter or less!  In the metal fruit basket, there's potato mashers, whisks, pots, pans, cups, pitchers, buckets, meatball maker, hand crank mixer, bundt cake pan, etc.  Add a watering can and an empty container? Mud is what you get. Lots of it. Know how much I spent? $6.00 for the entire setup! You know, they don't even get that dirty. My husband doesn't even mind them playing there one bit when they are under his watch.  It's actually a great way to get things done in our real kitchen, as the kitchen window opens out to this area.  Although our guest was confused at first (\"You're going to let me make mud?

Always love his work. Keep his passions regardless of what others think.  I want him to be confident, love what he loves and be himself. That's what inspired this shirt.  It's okay with me if his interest changes in the future..I just hope it's his choice and not a choice he feels he must make to fit in. Find people who accept who you are, little guy. Don't change to meet their criteria. Keep being you."},

(freshair.org).  Our real life 'city mouse/country mouse' story. We're so happy to have our little city guy back. We're so thankful his mom shared him with us again.Practically the first thing he said was \"I can't wait to run in the wide open field.\"  You know, that's just what he did straight away.  On the ride home, I asked him what he remembered most about coming.  We did all sorts of things last time around-beach, tide pools, canoeing, water park, fire pit, picnics, picking berries, gator ride, horse drawn wagon ride, etc. You know what he loved most? Besides the wide open fields, he said he loved the chickens, the two goats, making bread and making desserts from vegetables. That last one stumped me and he said \"Mom, carrot cake!\"  Why yes, we did pull some carrots from our neighbor's farm and made carrot cake. And we made zucchini cake. And yes he calls me \"Mom\".  I get to be his summer mom. I was feeling a little pressure, trying to think of what else we can do to one-up from last year.  Hearing what he remembered most and loved the best reminds me that he likes just being home with us.  Which is just fine, as it's where we all like to be best too. I told him we were so lucky to have him again. He seemed surprised/taken aback. \"You? No. I'm the lucky one.\"  We could argue the point or we can agree to disagree.  Or just decide that we're both lucky. I think that could be the truth.  We're so glad to have him back. Knowing we've already done many of his favorite things in the first hour he arrived...well, we can just relax and do them all over again each day he's here. That will make us all happy. Quite happy, indeed.﻿"},

Today, though, we'll get to all be together all day. Not sure what today will entail, but one thing I know for sure...whatever it is, we'll be doing it together.  My goodness, we have a growing girl!  Our little 4th of July firecracker is THREE! (Remembering: 2 1/2 years, 2 years 18 months,  12 months,  9 months?  6 months?  3 months?  Just being born ) My letter to Audra:  Audra Grace, In one sense, it's hard to believe you are three already, in another, you seem so much older sometimes. You fill our lives with conversation, constant conversation. And questions. Plus energy. Lots of energy.  And spunk. Neverending spunk. You love so many things. Animals. All of them. Especially tiny tiny ones and your cats.  You tell the animals, \"I am your mama, I take care of you.\"  You sometimes hug them too tight. You love to run, everywhere. You pretty much never walk from point a to point b. It's always a full out sprint.You could swing for hours.  You 'tirl\" (twirl) in dresses.  You jump on the mini trampoline over and over again.  You climb. You hang. You do flips (somersaults) down the hill. Your favorite exercise is swimming. As in jumping in, going under water and diving. You are fearless and pretty much never get hurt. You fall down and bleed, but jump up and keep going. You do also enjoy some sitting activities. Mostly art. You love to paint.  You spent a long time on your paintings and they are so colorful. You also love books.  Your favorite books are Richard Scarry and any book with a wolf/fox. Little Red Riding hood, Henny Penny, Gingerbreadman, Three little pigs.  You play 'bad animals' and sometimes pretend to be a wolf or a fox.   You take the time to notice little things. Bugs, flowers, details. Every single berry in our raspberry/strawberry patch with the slightest hint of red-gone. You also eat raw rhubarb, green onions and kale in the garden too. You frequently smell like a sub from all your snacking. You also like to chop, cook and bake. You love people. You love to chat on the phone. You ask about people you haven't seen and remember lots of names.  You talk about people who are \"spesh\" to you (special).  You freely give hugs and kisses.  You love your mom and dad equally and love to 'nuggle' (snuggle) us.  You love your brother. He is truly your best friend and you get along with him so well.  When he does bother you, you sometimes say \"Whatever Adri\" and walk away.  You love lots of food, but definitely love meat. And Cheetos. And bananas, eggs, cheese, homemade bread and celery. In fact, you'd eat all that stuff and call it a perfect meal.  Today though, you get your choice of meal and have chosen rice and beans. You don't sleep through the night still, nor have you ever just about. You have done so a handful of times your whole life I guess, but that's it.  You hardly take naps anymore.  Maybe this will be the year of more sleeping, but I doubt it. You just function on little sleep (sort of like your mama).  Other than your hugs and kisses, it is really the cutest thing seeing you 'wink' at me.  It's really not much of a wink, more a blink, but it's totally adorable. You are confident in what you do. You are independent. You are loving and you are loved by so many. Really, you add so much joy to our life. You keep us on our toes!  You are so much fun to parent and we love you oodles and oodles and oodles.  The many faces of Audra Grace (And yes, that's a mama made dress...more on that dress soon!):   I asked you a list of questions that I hope to repeat every year.

In the summer, the walls and windows come out and it turns into a floor to celling screened porch. It's the best place in the house, without doubt.

When we have company, we tend to just drift to the porch.  This is where life happens.  On a whim, I completely rearranged the whole porch.  The little nook that I created is where I sit and relax at night.

Apparently not close enough for him (she is miss independent).  He pulled himself together.  He went in the water without me. I was the only parent walking the perimeter of the pool and sitting on the sidelines to start. But he did it.  And by the end of the session, he was comfortable enough for me to sit on the bleachers. What a relief! As a reward, I pulled into the farm. They immediately recognized it and squealed \"STRAWBERRY PICKING!\"  Which is funny, because I am the only one who picked. They just ate strawberries. I even caught them taking the strawberries I picked OUT of the containers to snack on them. I guess they thought it was personal chef service?

It's grown since then, but I just didn't have a chance to get out there and take pics.Forgive me if I pat myself on the back a little bit. This is the best my garden has EVER looked.  I tried to work smarter instead of harder. 7 truckloads of manure. 4 truckloads of grass clipping mulch. 7 packed as much as possible giant grain bags of leaves for mulch.  The weeds are the least they have ever been. Hoping the yield will be the best yet this year!  So far, I've harvested and consumed/prepared 48.5 pounds of produce from our garden to date.  Well, that's what hasn't been consumed on spot. I am eager to know the final amount!  There's flowers on peas, peppers, tomatoes, cukes, different squashes, pumpkins.  There's mini summer squashes.  There's greens, oh the greens!  Garlic scrapes, green onions, fresh herbs.  This garden is feeding us now, for sure.beanstomatoes.  I planted them facing east, with the majority of the stem base underground so it had a chance to grow a strong root system. These are so sturdy. It pays to ask the farmers how they plant them!Squash of some sortTomatoes. Grown from seed, by me.I made a \"pea house\".

Wait..does that apply to sunflowers?broccoliI wrote zucchini, but it appears they are summer squash.PotatoesCelery and glads.   I think what has me most excited are the fruits.  This is the first year we're really getting a variety. Strawberries, cherries.  We have our first plum!  We'll have blueberries. Elderberries times a million. My husband helped me elevate the grapes and it looks like it has made a world of difference.  And apples. Not in our just planted orchard, but the trees I spent a cold day in February pruning a ton.  That tree is loaded with apples now! Not one last year, oodles this year. I sure hope they are good!  Most fruits are consumed on site. Which is just fine with me. First success at cherries!First plum﻿﻿Apples﻿Heirloom RaspberriesI decided to try a little experiment.  Did you read about growing 100 lbs of potatoes in a four foot space?  I have been wanting to try. Took some sprouted potatoes and an old wooden duckblind I found in the barn. Figured I'd give it a try.  Put it next to the compost out there. My husband helped with this project. :) We have potatoes in the garden too. We'll see which one yields more.﻿ You see our visitor?  Not a shy one. I think a rabbit has visited too. Even with the visitors, we've been bringing quite a bit in. We now have more radishes in our house than I've ever had before.  I'm not sure I'm a fan of radishes, to be honest.  But they are easy to grow and fun to harvest.  I think I'll just put them in soups and such.  I did put them with cous cous, olive oil, green onions, garlic scrapes and fresh herbs and we all loved it though.  My family loves kale. Goodness, we eat a lot of it. Glad it's back.Our meals have been looking like this: Homegrown/homemade for everything. Homemade hamburger buns, venison burgers, kale chips, that cous cous salad I listed above and canned pears.  Or mashed potato soup with fresh chives and homemade biscuits (must blog that recipe!). All in all, so good so far.  How is your garden doing?"},

So many good places with great scenery that we can go to for free. Since our newly wed days, I've kept a picnic blanket and collapasable table in the car. My thrifting has found some fantastic enamel camping ware, so I've tried to have that live in the car at anytime.  Last year, I decided it would be the summer of picnics. I committed to going on a picnic once a week, every week, for the entire summer. Although I only shared in this space a couple of our picnics last year, I can proudly say I kept it up. It was so worth it. A chance to unwind, enjoy new places, appreciate where we live, be together and all the while enjoying yummy food. With summer approaching, I all of a sudden remember that great summer tradition of last year and decided to keep it alive.  Picnic destination? The Hamilton House. Just about 3 years exactly we were there, with a very very very pregnant me.  Here's the link to that post. It's about time we returned to this beautiful location.

He's not the one who get up in the middle of the night. He's not the one who rises early with the littles. He's not the one who pays the bills or does the shopping or keeps up with the laundry. He calls these perks of marriage. (It's in a light hearted way....there's a lot of laughter and fun between us, so don't get the wrong idea! I don't mind those chores anyway).But can I tell you what he is? An awesome, awesome, awesome dad.  I cannot say that enough. We've worked (mostly) opposite shifts for their entire lives so we could keep them home. He does such a good job caring for them. He knows what they need and can take care of them just as well as me.  He's so gentle and kind, especially in the tiny little infant stage. He takes the time to teach them, listen to them and talk with them.  He has a great imagination, it's so much fun watching them play. By himself, he brings them on hikes, library story time, swimming and out anywhere they all so choose and has done so their whole lives (2 kids under age 2 he did in stride). He enjoys their company and would much rather be together as a family with the four of us than do just about anything else. I couldn't ask for a better parenting partner. These kids are so lucky to have him.  In fact, I think he does so well, that we need a few more kids for him to enjoy.  What a marvelous idea!

{"title": "My \"Other\" White Farmhouse", "date": null, "text": "My love of white farmhouses isn't a new thing. In fact, I've been crushing on white farm houses for as long as I remember. It may just be because I grew up living in the original \"Pray\" house on the \"Pray Road\".  A white farmhouse filled with memories.  In the barn we had cows, a horse, pigs, sheep, chickens, my 4-H rabbits, barn cats, golden retrievers and beagles. We had tractors, wagons, a rake baler, manure spreader and other various 'hitches' (as Adrian calls them). We had a garden with rhubarb, corn, peas, beans, tomatoes, onions, peppers, beets (yuck), zucchini, different squashes and different pumpkins.  We had a clothes line, a tractor tire sandbox, a swingset and a burning barrel. We had fences to climb, fields to roam, woods to explore and a pond to fish in/ice skate on. The house had a kitchen/dining room that was attached. My mom would talk on the rotary phone with a cord that stretched across the kitchen. My brother and I would sit on the heater. My mom would roll the dishwasher on wheels over to the sink after dinner to use it. My mom (a kindergarten teacher) had a huge shelf of books and she'd read to us by the hour in the living room or we'd crank the records and dance away. Or I'd mass produce friendship bracelets. We did have a wooden TV with a dial to turn by hand that had an antenna.  We sometimes got CBS and PBS, although it was sometimes fuzzy (it went in and out with the electric fence). French stations came in clearly (living so close to Canada).  We hardly turned that thing on, as we spent our time outside.  At age 12, when my mom was sick, we moved to an accessible house that my dad built for her. A log cabin set back off a dirt road with lots of acreage. I had the very large loft to myself-a large bedroom, another large room that became my sewing room, a library and my own bathroom.  Every teenager's dream, right? Not me. I longed for the farmhouse.  I remember a month or two after my mom passed away when I was age 15, I asked my dad if we could move back to the farmhouse, given we didn't need an accessible house any longer.  I had oodles of space in the new house, but that small bedroom in that small white farmhouse was what I so wanted to return to.  We didn't move back. However, my dad has kept it and rented it all these years. My dad just retired last year and has decided his retirement project is to fix up that old farmhouse. He did many improvements when I was a kid, but never was able to finish.  He has time now.My husband has never really explored the property because in the 11 years that I've known my husband, it's always been rented.  He wanted to see for himself the place I have told him all about.  It's only a walk in the field from the farmhouse to the cabin. Or about a mile walk on the quiet roads.  It made me so happy to be able to share the walk, the homestead and the memories with my little family.  Won't you come along?"},

It's almost time to go, I burst into sobs, say I hate leaving our homestead, that nothing is done, I'm so disorganized, etc. He just hugs me, tells me that I'm doing a good job and that we will have fun.  You know, I do have fun when I go away.But...I have the most fun coming home.  I came home tonight, went around to all the animals, gathered the eggs, met some baby chicks I hadn't seen before, visited the garden, smelled the fresh air. There were cats under my feet, a dog running laps, roosters crowing, goats bleating, hens squawking, children squealing, trains blowing their whistles.  There were new blooms in the garden (irises!), radishes ready, mini zucchinis growing and tomatoes flowering.  So many good new things. So many old familiar things.This vacation, I not only cried when I left, but I also cried when I came home.  Because there's nothing that makes me more happy than being home."},

But, tennis elbow for the first time tells me my goals may be too lofty to do alone.  I did enlist my kids to help more than ever, though. They are at a stage when their help is actually starting to help.  So, here was my garden May 23rd, 2015.And here's my garden today. It's officially all planted. There's no more room. I totally worked smarter and harder thus far. 7 loads of manure in the fall. 8 grain sized bags of leaves I bagged last fall to mulch and two truckloads of grass clippings. My husband helped with getting the manure, but the rest was my littles and me. The only areas that aren't mulched are the areas that were directly sowed. Just waiting for the stuff to come up before I mulch.  Just about all this stuff?  Planted from seed.  My littles and I started these seeds in the cold of March. Look where they are now.Some of the seeds we started were even saved from years prior. How's that for self sufficiency?! This year, I set up a pea house. When the peas are grown, hopefully this will be a fun place to play.And the random compost surprise growing... The orchard looks promising and my husband helped me increase our blueberry bushes. I think we have 16 now.  I started to put some pine needles as mulch (they love the acidic), but haven't finished yet.  I'm usually a bit embarrassed that I haven't measured up when I post these garden posts, but I do feel a wee bit proud thus far. I'm at 21 pounds of harvest processed/gobbled up thus far in the year. Hopefully my yield this year will be higher than last year's with all this soil improvement and mulching.As Audra was wandering and singing in the garden with me...Adrian was working. What a great place to watch the sun set."},

{"title": "Tiny tiny chicks", "date": null, "text": "So, here we have it. Year two and our own chicken eggs and chicks hatched out of our own incubator. I sort of get the giggles when I think about all this DIY stuff we've accomplished. As I type this, there are 12 chicks. Maybe more, not sure yet. We've had some loss and I am much less emotional dealing with the loss compared to last year. Folks who do this hatching thing a lot probably would think I'm a bit silly getting emotional about these little chicks, but last year my heart felt heavy when we lost some. This year, I understand more that it's a part of the process.  I don't know if it's good or not so good that I'm at the \"it is what it is\" point now.  Well, I guess \"it is what it is\".  I don't think my heart could keep getting into this farming thing without coping a little better with loss.  Anyway, onto the celebration. Audra is in \"tiny tiny\" heaven. She'd seriously hold a chick all.day.long. Adrian wants to push them around in his dump truck or tractor, but it's not time for that yet. When my kids aren't holding the chicks, they are watching them. In fact, I got little checked off my to do list since they hatched because with chicks is where we are at. Just the littles and me some of the time and we were lucky to share these chicks with some good friends.  We're currently at 59 chickens (layers, roosters and chicks), plus we have a broody hen with 11 viable eggs. And then my husband asks if we're collecting eggs for the next round in the incubator.  Goodness, he's got the bug now too.  Onto the pictures. They mostly are of her, as she's so 'motherly', talking to them, whispering to them, assuring them that all is going to be okay. So stinking cute! Here's our babies, some with overalls and some with beaks and wings. Some clean and fluffy, brand new. Some completely dirty, bumped, scratched and bruised from warm weather fun.  These chicks are well loved already.If you have a minute in your day today, I'd ask for some thoughts and prayers for my husband's family. Justin lost his dear \"Nana\" today. We just celebrated her 94th birthday last month. I have been lucky to love this woman for 11 years. When I think of nana, I think of food. She introduced me to a bunch of new foods, particularly Jewish foods, including matzo ball soup and kugel, as well as her random loves: crab ragoons and Boston marble coffee cake. She'd always eat her meals 15 minutes at least before the hour, which was stressful when ordering Chinese as the restaurant didn't open until 12.  She'd start calling at 11:30, hoping they'd answer before they officially opened. She also loved her dessert.  You'd always find a few milky ways in her secret drawer that wasn't so secret. You'd leave her house a few pounds heavier as she'd feed, feed and feed you. I couldn't arrive at her house empty handed either. She'd see me and get excited about what I might have baked her. Her fave? Homemade donuts. Once I arrived and the first thing she said to me, even before a greeting, was \"Good, you brought the donuts! My neighbor doesn't believe you make your own donuts. I'm going to call her right now and have her come over to try one.\"  She actually made me bring all my donut making supplies once so she could watch me make them. She never knew anyone who could make donuts! We always left her house with random stuff too. She had a tendency to give oodles to random charities and such charities would send gifts....like mounds of notepads, greeting cards and slipper socks. She hated throwing things away. Once we received a year's worth of wrapped plastic forks from her take out meals. I also remember spending the night at her house and she'd randomly check on my husband and me in the middle of the night =. She loved our dog Kammie and was super thrilled to have a chance to meet my kids. She loved to give them kisses (and they *mostly* let her!). When we visited, I'd have my kids pack a bag. We'd bring our nursery rhyme books and favorite books and read them all together.  Back in 2007, I made her a quilt. She used that quilt daily ever since. So many special memories, we're so lucky to have known her.  It's sad to say goodbye, but 94 years of age is such a full life. So much to celebrate.  Thankful to have had a chance to get to know her."},

As he's been getting older, his time attached to me has obviously been less and less. Partly because his sister is usually the one I (still) wear, but also because he's busy farming most of his day.  It's rare now that he asks. Each time he does so, I wonder....\"Will this be the last time I wear him?\"  Yes, he's older and heavier now, and no, it doesn't hurt me to wear him (I've worked up to it).  Instead, it makes my heart feel so full that his happiest place is still with me.  I know the day will end soon that he wants to be worn. So, I cherish each and every chance he wants to be my kangaroo.And just for fun, I pulled a few shots of my little roo growing up close to his mama.

We dropped thousands on a new furnace. which meant nothing new for couches in the budget. We just had to deal. I stopped by the thrift store and saw this cute little loveseat couch that was practically new. For $25.  Is it what I'd pick out if it was new? Probably not. Could it work in our space? I thought so. Although the husband was grumbling when I sent him to look at it, he was thrilled to bring it home. The broken couch is now in the playroom for the kids to jump on and do whatever with and this one is in our new living space.  Which of course prompted me to change things up. I moved furniture, rugs, the like from other rooms to gather new collections. It's probably not the way things will stay forever (insert husband grumble yet again), but it works for now! Here's the corners of the room. It's such a huge room.   There's a little nook for the rug hooking I started experimenting with.  Well, before the garden took over. And a little craft space for my littles. The chair on the left I did the seat. The chair at the desk I just scored a couple days ago for FREE on the side of the road.

PLus some other random seed packets, glads, dahlias and pole beans to put in. Plus we are adding more blueberries and 2 plum trees too. Speaking of fruit, we have blossoms on the fruit trees we added 1-2 yrs ago. Clearly, it's a place for bugs to get busy....  I wanted to make a more inviting porch, so I give it a little love and attention. (Those are $6/piece thrifted rod iron chairs, thrifted naturally.)  All in all, home sweet home is looking more summer like.  It will be mighty special when all is boasting with color and produce, we're looking forward to those days!   Now tell me, how are your gardens shaping up?"},
{"title": "Remembering", "date": null, "text": "May 20th. It's the day that would have been my mother's birthday. It's a special day for us. We'll make a cake...I'm thinking this one...given she loved loved loved chocolate:  and I'll tell my kids stories about her. How she was the most kind, loving, gentle mother ever. How she'd read piles of stories to us, I'd pick Bernstein bears and my brother would pick Dr. Seuss. How we were the champion 4-H club for oodles of years under her leadership. How she'd sing the watermelon song. How she'd talk to her mother on the rotary dial phone with the cord that stretched from the dining room to the kitchen. How she'd organize parties at the beach and invite dozens of friends. How my dad would give her money to buy something for herself and she'd come back with gifts for half the town. How she kept coupons from 1983. How she surprised us with hot crossed buns one day, right after I learned the lovely tune on the recorder. How she was always there for us, 24/7, her children her #1 priority. It's been 19 years since I lost her, but there's not a day that goes by that I don't think of her. My kids haven't met her, but they know all about her.  Always around her birthday, the lilacs bloom. Even with this past winter that went on and on, the lilacs are right on schedule. At this farm, we're lucky to have an abundance. So, we decided this year to do what she'd do. We'll just give them away. He made a sign, we filled the bucket and we waved to cars.   Car after car stopped...many folks we caught to wish them a happy day. (Adrian's mad because I made him stop waving for a picture...he really loved doing this).  The bucket has just enough left for me to bring into work. I'm smiling because spreading the goodness reminds me of all the good I was given having such an amazing mom.  If you were lucky enough to know Debbie, feel free and spread the love with a little pay it forward today too.    I tell you, it's been such an amazing journey thus far parenting this little girl. I have learned so much from her already, even though she's only 2 1/2. My son is 110% a miniature version of me. Work is his play and he goes-goes-goes during each moment of his awake time until he crashes. Then he wakes up and starts it all over again. Sound familiar?  He's a mini me in his personality, without doubt.  Muss Audra is entirely different. She's so much of what I'm not and what I want to be. She goes at her own pace. She balances \"work\" and play. Sure, she loves doing projects, but she also changes course and just spends time snuggling with the cats or watching a bug.  She's always content with what she has. She never needs new things. A tiny scrap of paper and a random pencil make her just as happy as a new package. She'll gladly read the same book for weeks on end. She would peacefully wear the same three items of clothing until they were in tatters. She also cares for others first, animals or people. She'll stop what she's doing to brush a strand of hair out of my face, to hug a chicken or to feed the cats.  She also knows exactly what she wants and isn't afraid to ask for it. (Frequently that is being in the gray carrier, close to mama lately...nice to have those snuggles.) Sometimes she will just pace back and forth in the yard, singing and swinging her hands. She's carefree, lives in the moment and is always happy. She's so much of what I want to be.   It's because of her we even veer to the swings.  And when we do, we really enjoy the marvelous sunsets in the backyard. It's because of her that he tries things other than farming.  It's because of her that we take a break to be silly. It's amazing that a little 2 1/2 year old has already taught me so much about the good things in life. She's also the very best example of how to really enjoy each day.  Everyone could use an Audra in their lives. It's one way to make the happy in your life even happier."},

We are all born with different strengths and challenges. The participants face so many more obstacles and challenges in life than their neighbors and peers. But...the day of Special Olympics is about celebrating abilities.  Everyone participates, gets cheered for and wins ribbons. There's a way for everyone to join. Everyone has something to offer.  Everyone is included.  It's really quite marvelous and the way life should be, all inclusive. 2) The smiles.  The smile of the one who won that sprint. The smile from the one who tried the long jump for the first time. The smile from the child in the wheelchair as they whiz past the finish line. The smile of the child receiving the ribbon. The smile of the police officer giving that ribbon. The parents and teachers beaming with pride. Classmates smiling proudly as they hold their signs up to cheer for their friends.  So much joy.  It's days like the Special Olympics when I really am thankful that there's a whole lot of people out there who think like I do.

Everyone is born with abilities and with some patient and encouraging coaching and teaching, the sky is the limit. So much potential and so much to celebrate. Special Olympics is just one day of the year, but I pray the smiles continue the other 364 days for the kids and parents of every child, regardless of their challenges, for abilities ought to be celebrated daily."},

Beautiful weather, sun setting, all of us together with a fire... What a frazzled mess...but just to prove I was there... And seedlings...oh those seedlings. My old tomato seeds certainly came.  I transplanted them and now have 22 6-packs or 132 seedlings of just tomatoes. Hoping for a bumper crop!I also have peppers, basil, parsley, eggplant, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, onions and greens up thus far. I have more cells filled with soil and plan to start a few more things. And soil! We've been improving it. Only my kids organize that which we add to the garden. Rabbit droppings, ashes, horse manure, chicken manure. We're getting there!  I don't remember how many truckloads of manure we added, but it's a start. And that compost is all turned and ready to go for next year. I also cleared out a path to the back tree in this picture. It's sort of like the Hundred Acrewood, which is a perfect place for pretending.

{"title": "More signs of spring...", "date": null, "text": "One of the very first purchases we made in this house was a wood burning insert. There's a fantastic woodshed attached to the house, but when we first arrived, there was nothing that took wood. Plus, a very old house without a secondary source made me nervous. Wise investment was the woodburning option, given we were without a furnace from October until January. Plus, there's no other heat like wood heat.Using wood as pretty much the exclusive source for the majority of the house (we have a small useless propane decorative stove in the kitchen that costs a bundle to run), we found out exactly how much wood we'd go through.  It was about one 'row' in the woodshed. You can fit 6 rows in the woodshed.  We need heat for about 6 months of the year. Coincidence? I doubt it. I suspect the folks who lived here added the woodshed as an addition. I suspect they tallied how much wood they would need and built a shed to accommodate a winter's worth. Pretty neat, huh?Most folks are winding down their heating season, but this is when it winds up for us! Since we're boring adults, a tax return means next year's firewood.  I'm thankful last year I ordered double what we would need on purpose.  Now, it's April and all of our wood for the winter of 2015/16 is dry and entering the woodshed. In fact, with my dad's help (first by fixing the wheelbarrow and then by throwing wood...thanks BOG!), we have 3 1/2 months worth already in there, most already stacked. It's so comforting to know that we have what we need for the next winter and it's going to be put away before the garden is at it's peak and my attention is needed for preserving. It's comforting to be planned ahead and ready.Now that we have empty pallets, the first round of the 2016-2017 has arrived. You can guess what we will be up to in the near future!(Bonus points if you can find the littles in this bottom pic.)We're getting into the seasonal rhythm in this house, given this our 3rd spring here.

{"title": "Thankful.", "date": null, "text": "I had two kids under the age of two. While I was on maternity leave, we made an offer on this farm. A month after I went back to work, we started the long process of moving. My husband was working all these 16 hour shifts, some overnight, at the time.  It was just my littles and me. I remember getting him to sleep in the car, wearing her while I packed the car, trying to drive over to the other house before he woke. Then I'd unpack the car at the farm, head back to the other house and get her to sleep while he helped me repack the car. Repeat.Then in this house, it was one thing breaking after another. Frozen pipes. No washer. No dryer. No dishwasher. Broken freezer (with all contents thawing on a 90 degree day in July). Broken fridge. No water pump. No furnace. I remember getting up for work 19 times the winter before last and thawing pipes with a hairdryer, with a kid on my back.  It always seems like it's been something these last 2 years. Whenever something is going on, that's when the biting, kicking, screaming, pulling hair commences. Every emergency wouldn't be complete without the ultimate brawl or meltdown. I share all this not for pity, not for competition sake and not to complain. These are real struggles that I face and I imagine I am not alone. I strive for peacefulness and calmness at home. There's been quite a few days that I've fallen short. Some days I have worn that stress on my face, body and spirit.  And that totally leads to my kids feeling unbalanced too.  I've been working on this.  Usually anything 'extra' can set me off, perhaps a bathroom construction project in particular could set me into a panic. As of late, this construction we have going in our house now is for the (hopeful) future goodness of our farm. Not because something is broken.  I am relaxed and happy thinking about the next steps.  I am thankful for the help we are receiving. I am overlooking the messy floors and clutter. I smile dreaming of good things to come. I think they can sense my peaceful thoughts, as they have been getting along famously as of late, playing together by the hour.There's two ways to go about the days we have with our littles.

So, as our family and our company sat on the porch for the first time this season, enjoying a meal together, we found ourselves talking about and dreaming about what's next. Bees?

Here's the etsy description: Meet \"Squeaks\".Squeaks is a cute little bookworm, who enjoys snuggling with a homemade quilt, eagerly awaiting adoption. Squeaks is hand crafted by a crafty mama and is inspired by my little girl who loves playing with things tiny.  Each mouse has at least some part of her upcycled (such as fabric/felt scraps, thrifted clothing, ribbons from gift bags, the interiors from laundered pillows, etc.), and therefore each may be a slight variation from the picture shown. They are upcycled to be environmentally conscious and to keep the prices down for the adoptive caretakers. Each comes with one tiny mouse (3 inches long), an upcycled origami box (from paper bags), a miniature quilt, a small pillow and a book with actual pages! This little mouse likes to be awake during the day, going on adventures with the caretaker is what Squeaks is looking forward to most.Come nighttime, Squeaks loves to be read to before being tucked into bed. It's the perfect set for tiny hands to enjoy. Imaginative play, simple toys and creativity are such joys of childhood. Adorable moments of play are sure to be in your future with these little gems.

All are in the living room.I never mark what I grow. Which is ridiculous because then things sprout and I have no idea. What's planted:Five types of tomatoes. Two types of peppers. Eggplant. Parsley. Basil. Onion. Greens. Another round of cantaloupe that will probably lead to nothing, like usual. (I think that's it? I can't remember since I never bother to label. Really foolish of me.)Anyway, come along and see our 'garden' thus far. (What, it doesn't look like gardening weather outside?)What a difference a few days makes!"},

Such a great project for a beginner.  It's a $2.99 piece of denim from the thrift store and an old pillow for the stuffing. That's it. So proud of his project he is...now to think of the next sewing project that is fun, but not too challenging. Suggestions?

{"title": "Our little chef", "date": null, "text": "Now, he gets quite worked up when we call him a chef. He's a farmer, you know.  He's going to drive John Deere tractors and have cows. Not be a cook.Let me back up a bit. It was grocery shopping day. I tend to wait as long as I possibly can. I couldn't wait any longer, I had to go.  \"But I just want to stay home and farm.\" That was the peanut gallery. I suggested while I was writing my list that they peruse the cookbooks. She got distracted. He was hooked. He went page by page. \"Mama, look at all the choices!\"  How he has never flipped through cookbooks before, I'm not sure. I told him he could pick whatever he wanted. Choices, choices. He settled on this fancy dish. \"Mama what kind of pasta is that?  And look at all this delicious begetables.\"  Now, the pasta was just \"bow tie\", but he apparently hadn't had that before. And begetables are usually called vegetables, and as a speech therapist, I should be fixing that. But \"begetables\" is much cuter (never mind the face he loves begetables, that's certainly a bonus).  He decided to write a list. \"Mama, how do you spell 'peppers'?\" At the grocery store, he was so serious, picking out the very best begetables. He showed the cashier, she could even read the list! She helped him make sure he had gotten everything on it. He even gifted her that treasured list. I'm sure she appreciated that lovely gift. When we got home, he was quiet. I asked him what he was thinking of. He decided he wanted to \"inbite\" (aka invite) our neighbors, as it was Nam's birthday earlier in the week. He wanted to give her a special birthday dinner. (Plus he made a gift, which the gift he made was a tractor bag-a paper bag with tractors on it. He was sure she'd enjoy that.) This kid chopped ALL the begetables. Zucchini, summer squash, five colorful peppers. He did it ALL.  He was so proud! He also sautéed them. He was so serious and so careful. It's a big job, you know..this cooking thing. He dumped them all into a huge mixing bowl and mixed it all up too...and helped scoop some into the serving bowl. Pair that with a salad and homemade breadsticks his sister and I made..yum.I should have taken pictures of him grinning his big grin. He was so proud to make this meal and share it with our neighbors. The recipients LOVED the dish and even asked for the recipe. Which, of course, had Adrian grinning ear to ear. Adrian loved it as well, as he ate FOUR huge bowls. (I think he ate more than his father ate!).The whole scenario unfolding was heart warming.  Him choosing what to make, planning, purchasing, prepping, cooking and serving. He took such pride in doing it on his own and such joy in sharing the fruits of his labor (should I say begetables of his labor?) with loved ones.  When I was in college, I recall a neighbor in the dorms who never had a chance to be in the kitchen. She desperately wanted to learn how to make something, even from a box. She had no idea. I volunteered to teach her how to make pasta from the can/box. She was elated. She really hoped I could teach her how to make deviled eggs, her favorite. She was astonished that I knew a 'recipe' for deviled eggs. I happily taught her some basics. This memory sticks in my mind.  18 year olds heading to college should have some basic kitchen knowledge. In my opinion, it isn't something that should have to be taught.  Little ones can grow up in the kitchen. The ring sling was necessary when cooking with both my littles when they were tiny. Now I pop them on the counter, a stool or a chair (or if you have a learning tower, that's even more fab).  They learn not because I'm teaching them, they learn because they are allowed to be in the kitchen, next to me, watching and perhaps helping. It's the way it was years ago. They way that it should be.Sure, sometimes it's more work, it's definitely more messy and often takes longer. But when your four year old plans, cooks and serves a meal for you...it promises many years of returned in-house dining. In fact, Adrian quietly told me just today, \"Mama, maybe I can be a farmer and a chef. Maybe I can have my restaurant next to my farm.\"  Farm to table?  Well, that sounds like the restaurant I will be frequenting.  Perhaps you'll join us?  Knowing Adrian, I'm sure all are \"inbited\". I think one of my very favorite family traditions is their half birthday celebrations. I never did this as a kid, just something I thought I'd try out.  What's not to love? A day to look forward to. The birthday banner comes out (make yours here). A day to wear your mama made crown. An extra special day when we celebrate the special kiddo. The very favorite dessert (apple crisp here, home canned apples!). A couple gifts (which the book was a quarter and the truck and puzzle were hand-me-downs). It costs next to nothing and it's a memory that I treasure and hope they will too. It's never too late to start a half birthday celebration...you'll be glad you did!"},

You are mostly a vegetarian, by choice. No way will you ever ever eat cow. Carbs and desserts are your fave. But you do love your salads and your fave fruit is grapefruit. You love books. I'll read to you for hours. You'll read to yourself. You have decided you want to learn how to read, so you learned your letters without teaching from me. I imagine your determination will pay off soon.You love Audra and play nicely with her. When daddy is gone, you say \"I'll be the man and take care of my girls.\" That you do!  You, sweet boy, are a joy to us.

Must remedy that.I whipped these mini backpacks up for them. 100% of the fabric was either thrifted or gifted. I actually used a pattern for these. I bought this pattern, Simplicity 5284, for fifty cents at the thrift store. (Given that it comes with sizes 3-8, and you could make a dress, a shirt, pants, a coat and a backpack from the same pattern, it's a good one to have).

I should just go to bed, but typing out a little something is something I look forward to, so I shall blog a few words before bed. What a week it has been, and it's only Wednesday.  We had a busy weekend and had little time at home to devote to weekend chores.  Given our no furnace situation, work and snowstorms, we haven't had a day that we have been away from our home for more than a couple hours.  A much needed family day, indeed.After that busy weekend, it's been time to kick it into gear. Since Monday, I have logged 25 hours of work at my day job, I've made 12 loaves of bread, washed 11 dozen eggs, I'm on my 10th load of laundry (where does all that laundry come from?), packed 3 hennies sold on etsy to go and live on their forever farms, visited 2 sets of neighbors, made 1 1/2 gallons of yogurt, ran a bunch of errands, made no bake cookies, brought my kids to story hour and read countless books to them there, went to the thrift shop, tended animals, loaded the woodbox more times than I can count, did a bit of sewing and read an entire novel (I just couldn't put it down). Too busy. Sometimes I have a hard time finding the balance and that was today. I've kept myself so busy that I've hardly slept!  But Thursday is a whole new day. I'm not working, I'm home. And I'm going to plan on doing a little less, which in turn will make all of our hearts feel much fuller. Nearly 9 years ago, I ran off and married my husband in Antiqua. When we returned, we were blessed with many wedding gifts, including two flannel sheet sets. The two sets have been rotated for 9 years and both have bit the dust this month. We have fantastic new LLBean flannel sheets on the bed now, but I just couldn't throw away the sets with holes. Sure it had holes, but the rest was usable. So, I made unpaper towels with just the fitted sheet of one of the sets.  All I did was take two 12 1/2 inch squares, sew them right sides together, leaving a 2 inch gap. I then turned them right side out, pressed the seams and edge stitched the whole square (which happened to seal the 2 inch gap). Lastly, I zig zag stitched from one corner to the next to seal the layers. Easy, although repetitive and a bit time consuming. Even with the holes, I was able to piece and make 20 different flannel squares that fit perfectly on a paper towel roll.  This nice papertowel holder my dad made has been empty for years (I cannot even tell you how many years it has been since I bought paper towels). Now, it's filled.  So, there you have it. An old sheet that I couldn't throw away, turned into something much more useful.   Zoom approved. One down, three to go. What can you make with an old sheet? Ideas? I still have 3 to use up. Oh, the possibilities..."},

It hitches and it's Farmall, which he didn't have.  I'm very very very appreciated right now in his book.I have the pattern that I will post (for free!) if anyone is interested, I just haven't gotten around to publishing that yet.

No. We cannot. He could care less about what he was making, provided it had the perfect fabric.I couldn't find John Deere fabric in my stash, but I did find some cows and barns.  Imagine how happy he was!We got to work. I found a pillow to cover, I measured the pillow, added an inch for seam allowances, he drew the chalk lines and cut out the whole thing with my fabric scissors. So exciting. I helped him pin the sides. Then he sat on my lap, raised and lowered the presserfoot and pushed the petal. As I helped him stitch away, I was so thankful for that turtle setting on the sewing machine my dad gave me for my sweet 16 (yes, I got a sewing machine when I turned 16. Best gift ever!). Slow, steady and carefully he stitched. Then we turned it right side out, pressed and he hand stitched the final opening closed himself.  Really, the most perfect project ever.

{"title": "Remembering", "date": null, "text": "Never in a million years would I guess I'd be sitting here today, not posting that which I planned, but something entirely different. It's with a very heavy heart and tears that I write this.  Our family is devastated by very unexpected loss of a close friend who we have known for the last 10 years. I usually don't post pictures in this space of anyone else other than family, but Sara felt like family, so it feels only fitting to have a post all about our dear Sara.Way back when I was set up on a blind date with mystery man who I ended up marrying, my husband worked with Sara.  When we moved to Maine, Sara let us know that we were practically neighbors. She was the first local person in Maine who extended greetings to us in our new home.  She was the one who took care of our pets anytime we went away.  She loved all animals. Our dog, Kammie, always knew to check her pockets, as there would almost always be a dog bone for her.Sara worked in restaurants and always talked about the food scraps tossed in the garbage and how she hated to just throw them away when she knew they would be useful. When we lived at the other house, she asked if we wanted them to compost. At that point, we weren't set up for that, so I declined.  Once we moved and got settled in, I asked if the offer was still good. She was so happy to put those food scraps to good use!Usually about 3 times a week, we'd have a visitor. Sara would come and leave treats for us. She never wanted to disturb us, so if we didn't catch her, we'd find secret packages for the pets, topped with a couple dog treats, so each of our kids could give a bone to Kammie.  My kids were always disappointed when we missed her.  When we caught her leaving those surprise packages, they'd holler \"Sara\" and sprint towards her, offering the biggest of hugs. They loved showing her what they were up to and Sara would go with them to give the treats to the animals. The kids weren't the only ones who looked forward to the visits. I did too. We'd talk about food, gardening, homesteading...all of which Sara was interested.  We talked about turning the 2nd floor of our garage into an apartment someday and renting it to Sara. She loved that idea. Sara enjoyed the simple pleasures of life and would have been so happy living here.While gifts to the animals were plentiful, she also had gifts for us too. Audra has these little shoes that Sara gave her that she wears frequently. She calls them \"Sara shoes\".  She gave my kids her entire Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer figurine collection for Christmas, as she knew they enjoyed that movie as much as she did.  Through the years there were also gifts here and there for me too. An ice cream maker, various kitchen utensils, vintage things she knew I would love. Just last month she brought me a shortbread pan that she had and never used as well as some vintage dishes she knew I'd love. Such a giver. Sara followed this blog daily, probably since my very first posts. Although she likely would not be impressed with me doing a post just for her.  In fact, it's a wonder I have any pictures of her at all!  She always showed up at our community Country Livin' parties, but stayed on the outskirts, pitching in if needed or smiling and enjoying all the children squealing in excitement. She showed up when I was taking my kids' Christmas pictures. Per usual, they sprinted to welcome her. I had my camera in hand and encouraged her to get in on a picture with them. \"Oh, not me! Just your kids. I just got out of work, I don't look picture ready.\"  I made her get in the picture anyway. So glad I did. My Adrian has spent much of the evening tonight just looking at this picture and remembering.It's hard to believe our dear Sara is gone.  She gave the kids little sponges for the tub just last week. She was here the day before she died. I was afraid something was wrong when she didn't respond to my Email, I actually said to my husband, \"Sara always responds, I hope everything is alright.\" I never expected a goodbye. The last Email she sent was a couple days before she died and it said \"Hugs to all!!!!\".  Sara will be missed dearly. We're so blessed to have known her."},

It's quite fun catching their after Christmas 50% of sales.  Certainly a bit more $$ than thrift shops, but it's so much fun! There are sooo many antique shops around us. Rte 1 Southern Coastal Maine....there's one about every mile in some parts! I recently read that you can tell a lot about a person's loves the most by how they spend their money. Well, I spent mine on my family and my home. Fitting, I'd say.For me: Another Robinson Ransbottom blue striped pottery. Sure, I have 30 of them. I absolutely need another.  Besides, the resale value is high. I don't know why I tell myself this, as I most definitely not selling any of them.For the husband:  Another blue hand blown glass. For my son: A bunch of quilt squares that are vintage men's dress shirts. There's a ton of these, I cannot wait to finish the quilt. For my daughter:  I made my son a train table for table top play in his room. I was thinking of making her something. But then, I found this darling little dresser that is just her size.  I love it.So there you have it, my perfect Christmas present. Who else loves going antiquing?"},

Only lately, not so many pictures. It's because we've been sort of out of commission. Well, not really sort of, definitely.  We've been sick, the sickest my family has ever been. In two and a half weeks, my kids have gone somewhere exactly three days. And one of those three days was to the doctor.  You know my kids are sick when Adrian hasn't farmed all day with his play farm and Audra has spent most the day on the couch. Plus neither of them have held a chicken in days. So not our typical. The flu was suspected, but thankfully that's not the case. Never thought I'd be relieved for \"just\" sinus infections, but we are. Everyone is still so sick and we are having a hard time shaking it. Nighttime is like having an infant again with everyone up hour after hour. I know I'm a wee bit exhausted when I see that I have so few pictures. Perhaps walking into the doorframe of the bathroom just a few minutes ago and breaking my glasses might be a sign that I really ought to go to bed. I'm heading that way now, but not before I post a little something. I've been trying to get them outside for fresh air as much as possible, but their energy and the Maine winters don't always coincide. Anyway, I do have these pictures. I snuck up on them while they were playing. Our four legged pal, Kammie, is really the best dog ever.  I'm hoping shortly we can get back into our regular groove."},

Little did Sue know that I would take the challenge and actually complete it. It's really not a lofty goal, I promise.  Just making a little time for that which you want to do every month is totally do-able if you're interested!  Just working 15 minutes here and there for a whole month and you'll end up with a finished product in no time.  It's easy to let life, family, other hobbies and work get in the way, but it doesn't have to be the case if you wiggle a little time here and there.I'm super excited how many homemade dresses my little girl has now. She had a couple I made before this challenge, but now she has even more!  I love making little girl dresses, as they are forgiving and will fit for some time, and they can turn into a shirt later on.  All of these dresses were made from patterns I was gifted or bought at the thrift store.  There's only one dress that I bought the fabric new-the rest are either upcycled (many from wool) or from fabric from a thrift store.  My little girl has a bigger wardrobe now and it cost next to nothing.  Anyway, here's the challenge and the link to all the dresses.Dress one: Here.Dress two: Here.Dress three: HereDress four: Here.Dress five: Here.Dress six: Here.Dress seven: Here.Dress eight: Here.Dress 9Dress 10Dress 11Dress 12And here they are, all 12 of them!Dress 1, 2, 3, 4 Dress 5, 6, 7, 8Dress 9, 10, 11, 12 I think it's pretty neat to watch her grow. 12 dresses, 12 months...she's growing up in mama mades.12 months, 12 completed projects.  Now this project is complete, I ponder another 12 month project.  What should I commit doing every month for the next year?  What would you pick?

At least the house is better suited for our needs right now.  I posted some of the spaces the last week and a half, so do scroll back if you missed some posts.  Anyway, here is her room, decluttered.  (So many mama mades: quilts, rabbit family, most all the dolls, etc.) The highlight? This \"couch\" I made her for book reading. She was sooo happy and spent a ton of time here. I can't help but smile at the vintage book love she has...for the some of the same books I had as a kid. Sometimes it's good to host story hour too. Her room looks especially magical at night. It's mighty fun decorating for a little girl."},

It doesn't really matter.  Needless pressure I put on myself. Since I don't like unfinished projects, I had to finish. I looked up the date I finished my first dress of 2015, it was February 5th. So it is technically 12 dresses less than  a year. But really, it doesn't matter.

{"title": "(More!) Organizing and wall art", "date": null, "text": "I'm still at it, this organizing thing.  Our bedroom tends to be the dumping ground for books, even though there's book storage in each of their rooms.  We read to the kids before bed and naps in our bed, sometimes in between, and then for whatever reason, I find piles of books everywhere. Well, 'pile' is a generous term, as it implies neatly stacked. Not so. Thrown haphazard would be more descriptive. Plus all my magazines all mixed in the mess. Drove me bonkers. Needed to do something about it.I moved this bookshelf in to stack the books on it.  I thought a shelf for kid books and then the rest could be for whatever else might look nice there.  Well, that was a short lived fantasy as Adrian hauled box after box of books to store in our room. Alas, they are not on the floor, so it's fine.  I think it was this time last year that I talked about getting wall art. I printed some of my own photos for myself for Christmas last year and never showed you.  The print over our bed is one I took. It was printed something like 3ftx5ft on engineering print. I think it only cost ~$10.00 with a deal staples was having.  It's just up there with poster tack, but it makes me smile. Plus I printed that big pic of my kids with the chickens, the same shot that had a 2 page spread in the From Scratch: Modern Homesteading Magazine a couple months ago.  I think that image will forever be my fave. (The photo above you can see it better).   This is what I wake up to every morning. I look up and see my the little baby pictures I took of my kids in the hospital. Plus our wedding picture.  Nothing like starting my day with a happy memories. And the hats. This is art and storage wrapped into one. These chicken lamps were a Christmas gift to myself last year too.  Of course, when everything is organized well, the kids find it to be the exact perfect spot to make a big mess.   It's okay though. Home is for living anyway.  Do tell me, what have you been organizing?"},

Only it's not a pencil holder. He decided that from square one.  He said it was a wagon to hitch up to his tractor. He talked about going to Lowe's and getting wheels.  Well, over a month later....maybe even it's been 2 months...he was still talking about those wheels. I finally brought him to Lowe's.  He interrupted a sales person. \"Excuse me, I need some wheels to fix up my tractor wagon. You have any? Thank you, those will work.  You got any hitches so I can hitch it up?\"And just like that, his little project turned into just what he 'needed' on his farm. With a hitch, naturally. Happy kid. I tell you, this beauty has been mighty busy.Busy doing what, you wonder? Well, today it was hauling all the Holsteins and black Angus to new pastures.  He's also hauled horses, hay, logs and duck pools. Important work, I tell you.    And this mama? I'm beaming from ear to ear that he had this little crafting vision and it turned out a great project that he uses daily now.  I'm eager to support his next crafting ideas.

{"title": "Revamping and Organizing. ", "date": null, "text": "You didn't think that I had forgotten, did you? I did promise that I was going to be tidying and organizing.  I'm still at it! I completely moved everything around in the living room, making some more play zones.  We have lived in this big house long enough to have a little rhythm down as to which rooms we spend our time in based on the season. Not on purpose, mind you.  There's just certain rooms that are more comfortable during some seasons than others.  We have a play room, but right now it is the coldest room in the house (especially since we do not currently have a furnace and have not all winter thus far...sigh). Come fall and spring, when the temperatures are mild, we spend our days in the playroom. Come winter, we tend to gravitate to the room that's the warmest, which is the living room.  It's funny how we spend so much time in the living room now, as come summer, we hardly enter this room. It is then when we shift to screen porch living.  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is I now know that all of my kids' stuff will be gravitating toward the living room for the next couple months. I decided it was a good room to focus on adapting, as for the next couple of months, it is their play room.  So, I moved the couch and chairs waaaay over, opening up a whole bunch of space.   Space for farming, naturally.   I showed you the music corner on Monday. And I also made doll house/garage/machinery shop/horse barn and the castle they use as a zoo zone.  Thinking back to my childhood days, this is where I'd spend forever playing. It took zero time before it got some use. Use by him, that is. She spends more time doing stuff like this. Although she'll occasionally take care of her babies.I made her a little fine motor zone, right in front of a sunny window. This is where she could spend her day.  Crafting like her mama. So there you have it. Our living room revamped for us to live in it fully over winter. Tell me, have you been organizing too? What have you revamped? Or what are you planning?"},

{"title": "Community Thankfulness", "date": null, "text": "I grew up in small town Northern New York. No, not NYC, Northern NY. My husband first described it as \"Drive into the middle of nowhere and then keep going for a couple more hours.\"  Middle of nowhere towns=everyone knows everyone. There's such a community there, it's mighty special.  In 2003, my brother and I picked up our lives and moved to separate apartments in adjacent towns in New Hampshire. I was starting graduate school and he was transferring his credits to continue his undergraduate degree. We knew no one but each other. I tell you, it was soooo odd going grocery shopping. I'd go for an hour and recognize no one. No one greeted me, asked how my dad was doing, asked what my brother was up to or asked if I had been making any quilts lately.  No one, other than the cashier, said anything to me.  It was so foreign being anonymous in a grocery store. Even more weird was being anonymous in that great river front apartment.  I came a couple weeks before my brother to get settled in, and I didn't know anyone.  I spent my days exercising, sewing and reading an entire book when I first moved.  No one greeted me or welcome me to the neighborhood/apartment complex.  Where is that community?, I wondered.  Given I was very lonely and not a patient person, I decided to create my own community.  I baked for all my neighbors and welcomed myself to the neighborhood.  What do you know...marvelous neighbors....many who I am still in touch with today! One couple set me up on this random blind date (which has led to a nearly 9 year marriage).  As much as we loved the community in that NH apartment, nothing gold can stay. We ended up purchasing a cute little home in the woods in Maine in 2006.  \"Here we go again, starting over\", I thought. Another place where we knew no one. I waited for the welcome to the neighborhood, nothing. No longer a rookie at welcoming myself to a neighborhood, I got straight to work.  Over 8 years we have lived in this neighborhood now. As I was driving home the other day, I had an epiphany.  I left the community I grew up in, but years later, although I will always have that old community, I now have a new community.  The neighbors wave. We trade animal care. We have playdates. Some watch our kids. We stop to chat. We share eggs. We make plans. People call/stop by looking for the 'bread lady'.  We open our home and have a house full.  Our place has become a gathering place.  I'm thankful this sense of community has blossomed, as the community we built have been such an integral part of my children's childhood already. I must say, I have a particular love for the relationships between little ones.  These are just a few of the shots I captured in the last month that melt my heart.  In addition to these pictures below, there's another dozen or so children who have walked through our doors in the last month and I've had similar feelings of joy watching all the little ones interact (I just need to remember my camera more often).  I am confident that this sense of community will continue to be fostered and it is my hope that our home will always be a welcoming place for that community.  And now, I've rambled on enough...here's the pictures that I hold near and dear to my heart.  Lots of friendships right here. <3"},

Another Hanukkah arrives and still unfinished.  I finally bit the bullet and completed it. A couple days late, but not too late this year. I actually had this whole pattern that I was going to post so you can make your own, but I never got there. Background. I don't know much about Hanukkah.  Although my husband's religious affiliation isn't Jewish any longer, he comes from a Jewish family. I thought it would be good if we kept some of the traditions he was familiar with as a child for our own children. We had a menorah that broke in the move.  I've kept my eyes open at thrift stores, but haven't found one.  I know I *could* go to a store that would sell them, but just thinking about going to any store where there might be too many holiday shoppers at once in the middle of December gives me anxiety.  (Plus, candles and cats=fire hazard.)Anyway, I apparently would rather craft my own menorah at home than go shopping in December.  Perhaps not normal, but if you've been around long enough, you aren't surprised.  The 'flames' snap on and off. There's a tiny pocket on the bottom to store them. It serves the purpose quite well. I didn't plan to put it here for good... But, you know, it works.  I was pretty proud of myself, giving my son the history lesson and the background about Hanukkah.  All he got from the story?  He wants to get to day 8, as I might have uttered the word 'present' in that breath. Well, I tried.  This pic was taken a couple days ago, it's more filled up now. Who knows, maybe by day 8, I'll dig out the pack of Jewish cookbooks I was given from my husband's grandmother and prepare us a feast. More accurately, given my record, the feast will be ready in exactly one year's time. Oh well. Happy Hanukkah, friends!"},

Click here for the pattern. 2) Place right sides together. Start at bottom, backstitch. Stitch along two sides. Stitch in last side, leaving a 1 1/2 inch gap in the middle. Backstitch.3)  Snip the ends off so they are not pointy. Turn right side out. Stuff with your stuffing of choice. 4) For trunk piece, place on ironing board so shorter sides are at top/bottom. Fold in 1/2 inch and press.5) Fold in half so the two pressed sides are together.  Fold again, so the two raw edges are together. Stitch sides. 6) Pin the trunk into the opening. Hand stitch to close. Stitch onto burlap or ribbon before hanging. They are so fun to make, you might find yourself mass producing.

Along comes stealthy wife, with a great ad from craiglist. Only used a couple times for a HUGE chunk off the original price. Brand new vs. slightly used.  Used, hands down. And then boom....the next day...no more grass and just this.  Green vs. white. The white won. While our little guy spent more than an hour shoveling a path to his animals and a path to our garage (his own idea!), he petered out when he hit the driveway. Rightly so...there was a lot of snow. After they went to bed, attempts were made to use the snowblower, unsuccessfully. Power went out. We were feeling defeated.  We gave up and went to bed.  Adult calmness vs. Adult temper tantrum.  Well, it wasn't quite a temper tantrum, but basically the beginnings of one, yeah that's what won.  But then, the beauty of the morning...so stunning. Inside or outside? Stay inside by the fire or enjoy the beauty? Finally outside won. Thankful I did, it was so beautiful.  Although I must admit...pajamas vs. actually getting dressed...  Pajamas won.  (And how about my brand new boots? ...Never even worn, perfect tread.... thrifted for $5.00. Much cheaper than the LL Bean ones I was planning on getting. Score.) Complete failures vs. success.  With a little less stress, prayers and a whole lot of patience, success won in the end.﻿I realize this post is scattered.  But that's how we were feeling with this storm.  With the snow, the power, the learning curve of something new, a house to worry about, two kids to look after and a Thanksgiving meal to make.... we weren't ready for all these curves. Every decision felt like we were contemplating and we felt conflicted. Which is silly, as we do live in Maine and we should be more prepared. Sometimes it's good to take a deep breath, step away and then try again.  When we do that, things really do change lots of time. And when they do, things are wrapped up before you even know it sometimes.Which is good, as less anxiety, frustrations and impatience leads to more time to just enjoy and be thankful for the day.  I guess our little bout of bad day blues was good, as once it turned around, we really saw how thankful we are.    I still have a few days off of work.I'm going to remind myself to push aside those adult decisions so I can fully embrace being where I it matters, home with my littles.﻿"},

{"title": "Tidying ", "date": null, "text": "Well, I guess tidying isn't the word. It's more like emptying.  I'm going room by room and just taking things away. Not that anyone is in trouble, but just to simplify.  Sometimes our stuff gets messy and no one wants to clean it up. I think that's because we have too much stuff out that it doesn't seem manageable. So I've been going room by room. Boxing things up, putting things away. No more than 3 stuffed animals in the bedrooms. 90% of the toys away with just a few options out. Taking away 3/4 of the clothes.  Simplifying. At first, Adrian was furious with me. He hates change.  But then he said \"Mama, thank you for putting all my clothes away so I can always shut my dresser drawer now easy.\"  And he knows about trading: \"Mama, I'm done with these, let's switch it up.\"Although he was hesitant, he totally is starting to see the value of less.  And playing. They are playing so nicely now. Much deeper play. Behavior has been better.  It's really such a good switch. Here's their art area. I took everything away except for crayons, a pencil, stencils and a few pieces of paper available. That's it. Better play, more focused, beautiful art.  I'm going to keep going, room by room. And by the time I'm done, I'll probably have to do it all over again.  It's hard work simplifying, but the results are well worth the effort.Starting out the morning with oatmeal in his fave cow bowl, warmed juice (which is really just the water I boiled the pears in) in his fave mug as of late, and his favorite type of pleasure reading.  When you start your day with all your favorites, how can it not be a fantastic day?"},

{"title": "Three Season Porch", "date": null, "text": "So...this three season porch.  It's marvelous.  For warm weather living, there's floor to ceiling screens.  It's no longer warm weather living in Maine....so it's been on the to do list for some time to get the screens out and the walls and the windows in. Now, this set up is likely a century old.  It's heavy, labor intensive and has to be just perfect to fit. Lots of shimmying, pushing and squeezing to get it to fit.  The first time we did it, my dad and husband spent the entire day on it. Last year, my husband and I did it and it took more than half the day (and I shall never forget that time...for I was climbing ladders, holding windows, fastening hooks, with a baby on my back).  This year, with the help of our farm truck, amazing husband/wife teamwork and shoving snacks at the kids to keep them back, we did the whole thing in just over 2 hours.  I'd say that deserves cake. I may or may not have made cake to celebrate.  Totally justified, don't you think?Anyway, I have so many ideas for out here and haven't taken the time or made the effort to complete my vision for the porch.It's not done, there's more I want to do, but it's comfortable, a great space to play and used now the screens are gone. It's amazing, as on sunny days, the temperature is often warmer than in our house.  Perfect spot to get a little warmth in the winter and it will serve as our greenhouse to start our seedlings come spring.  It's a huge area. Big enough for a living space...And a dining space.Oh this wooden tray! I was so excited when I found it.  It was this summer, I think it was $10.00. Thrifted, naturally. A little splurge for myself. It's huge (as in my kids wanted to pretend it was their boat), wooden and even more important than collecting  miscellaneous things, it's a marvelous serving tray to carry the plates and such from the kitchen to the porch.More than anything...this space is so great to play in.(She doesn't mind living on the dangerous side. She was trying to hold onto the horse and jump with it up and down.)So, in your travels, plan to meet us on this porch. It will keep us warm on sunny winter days and we can enjoy a spot of tea as our children try to give us heart attacks doing dangerous things on the trampoline.

I've been looking for an inexpensive hutch for the craft area to improve the storage and hopefully give another table top surface.  I've looked every couple of weeks for the last year, but hadn't found anything reasonable or local.  Finally,  something popped up. A hutch close enough to home for only $60.  Storage, I love thee...And organization. I love walking into this space and seeing less mess. I just collected some random things to organize.   Not perfect, but better than it was. It's soo much easier to find things. I'm not sure if I'll paint it or leave it as is.  Thoughts? And of course, like all things, my littles were 'helpful'. He was fabric shopping. They were drafting patterns.  And this chair is their house, which you should know in case you want to come over. And something else I organized through this process....PATTERNS....SQUEEE!!   A dear blog reader generously sent me a HUGE box of patterns (THANK YOU!). Not just any patterns, but little girl dress patterns!!!! I think she gifted me 53 of them (many vintage!)....and each pattern has 4 or so options, so many choices! I'm excited just writing this!   I totally squealed when I got them and I spent hours just holding them and looking at them.  And then another blog reader left a pile at our breadstand. And then add those to the all the ones I have. I have a lot. Okay, that's an understatement. I have a pattern shop right in my craft area.  How lucky am I?  While I do have the skills to create patterns, it's soooo much less time consuming to have printed ones. And there's so many options. I'm a lucky duck.  This reorganization of the craft zone has lead to a delay in making/posting the monthly dress. I know it's only my personal deadline and not a big deal, but rest assured, I'll have that post for you soon.  And now....the choice, which pattern will be dress # 10 of the year for sweet girl?

{"title": "Name that Chicken", "date": null, "text": "That's right, name that chicken.  I tried to look them up, but I got overwhelmed. Which is why I'm hoping you will help me!  Let me give you some background.  Last year, we ordered baby chicks.  There was a surprise rooster in there.  I decided to keep him, hoping to incubate our own. Fast forward to this spring, we got our incubator all set up. Many eggs were viable. One pipped and hatched but didn't make it. We waited for the others, to no avail. I thought I did something wrong with the humidity.  Tried again.This time around, same thing happened. Many were viable but we waited, waited and waited some more. One pipped, hatched, but didn't make it.Checked the temperature.  BOTH thermometers were off. BOTH of them!  Used the fancy LL Bean thermometer and BOOM. Chickens hatching right and left! Some we got into the incubator, some more were pipping, all so exciting! And then while I was out and about with the kids...the *^& cat turned up the incubator to 117 degrees and cooked the rest.  I cried.  I was so defeated that I ordered 25 baby chicks online. But then, the next day, I decided to give it one last whirl. Eggs are only supposed to be hatchable if collected 10 days prior to incubating. I had many more collected from days prior to the 10 day mark.  I decided, why not try?  I filled the incubator. Two days before the baby chicks were supposed to arrive, the incubator was bursting with excitement. Long story short, we ended up with 47 baby chicks.  In a brooder in our play room. Plus the 13 layers in the barn.  We turned into a crazy chicken family overnight with 60 chickens.  Oops.Oh my.  Alas, most all have made it and they are pullets now!!  I think we have 7 roosters that we must do something with. And our mail orders...we need help figuring out what they are. I ordered 'assorted brown egg layers\" and they threw in an extra 'rare breed'. So....what we have now...Mostly Rhode Island Reds. That's what we hatched. Plus some of the mail order ones were Rhode Island Reds too. Goodness, the roosters are huge. And they scare me around the kids, but the kids are not afraid.  These kids are not without me with these 7 roosters, I tell you.And then we got Buff Orpingtons, (yellow) which we have as layers already.  And we also have Australorp (black), which we have not had before.And then (1) we have what I think are White Orpingtons (?).(2) Then we have this one, which is lighter than the Australorp but darker than the Rhode Island Red.  The head feathers are different from the body feathers. Guesses?(3) Then we have four of these. These are lighter than the Rhode Island Reds, but darker than the yellow Buff Orpingtons.  (4) Then this is the rare breed. We call her fuzzy feet.  She's really interesting. So there you have it. The ones we don't know for sure, 1, 2, 3, 4. When I look them up, I get overwhelmed, so all of you chicken lovers must help me out.In case you're wondering, the layers....we have Barred Rock, Buff Orpington and Rhode Island Reds. We used to have Aracanas, but not any longer. Here's one of our beloved Barred Rocks.   These chickens are used to being hugged. <3Do you notice the vintage nesting boxes?  They were in the coop I used to have as a child. My dad brought them to me (squee!!!).  Only they don't lay in them, they lay in the troughs.  Maybe someday they'll learn to appreciate vintage nesting boxes. I'll have to have a talk with them.Anyway, how about a warm egg?...how we love thee.  And I love how they both are wearing a mama made-his shirt and the overalls I made for him, but now fit here. Many thanks in advance for helping us with labeling these chicken breeds!"},

I do love fall.So, 2014, not the best gardening year for us. It started off grand! Then deer helped themselves at the beginning of the year.  And then we had company for one week with a two week vacation after that, which means a whole month of things not tended and going wild.

Weeds will surely be the death of me, I tell you. And the soil, this is my biggest challenge right now. When we first moved, they did some work and deposited one foot of sandy soil on top of the soil that held a garden for 100 years.

We now have a farm trucks (SQUEEE), even with Maine Farm plates on it. (SQUEEE! And thanks BOG!).  Manure is in our near future.

Being the good wife I strive to be, after the kids went to bed, I made him his favorite meal to take to work tomorrow, and brownies topped with hazelnut cream cheese buttercream frosting.  I had to use up some eggs, you know.  It's nearly midnight here and I just don't have it in me tonight. So, if you do want to make one, tell me, and I'll upload a pattern. All he wanted to do was take a picture of the two of them together.  She wasn't very cooperative, the lighting was way too bright, but I totally appreciated how he wanted me to take his picture for once."},

I'm a (25 hour a week) working mama and I took the first week off of 'school' off of work to be with them at camp.You know, it was the best decision.  A whole week going at their pace. Sure, the days were filled, but they were filled with what they wanted to do, following their lead of what they wanted to learn about, following their interests. I didn't squeeze in as many visits as I wanted to, craft as much as I wanted or read as much as I wanted.  But I was with them, embracing their first week of 'school at home', learning from far away, giving them my full focus. Although it looks like I carried the camera around, I didn't take as many pictures as I could have. We have so many memories from that week that live in our heads...a great way to set the pace of a new school year.  That's what keeping them home is all about, embracing and enjoying this learning process....together.  At the end of the day, when my camp bed was full of them (with obviously no room for me!),  or when I just smiled at the early sleepers snuggling,  I couldn't help but smile too. I don't know how long they will be homeschooled, but perhaps as long as I do, vacation plans ought to start out our non-traditional first week of schooling. I do hope we're easing into a great year of learning together."},
{"title": "Vacation Highlights #7", "date": null, "text": "A visit to Almanzo Wilder's Farm.  I've been a long time fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder. They were my very first chapter books, and I was hooked. Just ask my cousins, we all were. Instead of fairy houses, I'd recreate the whole homestead with sticks. We'd get dressed up and play Little House on the Prairie in the woods.  Our books would become tattered from re-reading.Back in the day, it was just chapter books. Now? They have a whole series \"My First Littehouse Books\" that tell the story of Laura and Almanzo, with pictures that are so intricate and intriguing that we take forever to turn the page.  We have a bunch of books and have interlibrary loaned the ones we do not have.  Our copies have been read so many times that the corners are tattered. Really, an awesome series. Well, my little guy has gotten so into the series that he thinks these are current day stories.  I guess having a mother who is an intense homesteader, the books don't really convey 'the olden days' to him.  Anyway, Adrian was really looking forward to going to Almanzo's house, as he wanted to meet him. He wanted to invite Almanzo to his birthday party.  He wanted to ask him questions about his cows, Star and Bright. He wanted to help Almanzo with barn chores. He wanted to see his pumpkin from the county fair. He wanted to sit by the fire and eat apples and popcorn with him too.  For a bit, I started to tell him that Almanzo was long gone, this was a story about long ago, and on and on.  But then, I stopped.  Really, what purpose would that serve?  Visiting Almanzo's house was magical to him, why take away the magic?  Why take away his fun?  And you know what was extra special? This one man who worked there introduced himself as Almanzo's dad. He said Almanzo wasn't home.  Adrian's eyes sparkled with delight.  \"Almanzo's dad\" asked for Adrian's address. You shall see at the end of this post what a special and generous thing he did for my little guy.But first, the visit.  He arrived with his fave book. And when we bought tickets, they were super enthusiastic to pick out the ones they have and the ones they want. So serious, taking it all in. And excited to see it all (sorry to the folks who had to tour with us). That which we were seeing matched the book, to his delight. Same in the house (we weren't allowed to take pictures in the house, but it matched the book very nicely too.) And the barn matched the book too. We had permission to take these, oh, they loved to pump water!   And to play in the same yard as Almanzo. And eat apples just like Almanzo did (these they pilfered off the lawn...resourceful.) Magical.   I so wanted to get some good pics of them together. They had enough of me, but I tried my best. This tree was Almazno's, look how old it is! Restoration and preservation-remarkable. I could have spent all day here. He could have too. And the special treat?  A few days later, my Adrian turned 4. The day before his birthday, he received a surprise package from \"Almanzo's dad\". We didn't have this one. Totally made his day. (And to 'Almanzo's dad', Thank you sooo much for the generous and thoughtful gift and for making my son's day.)Such magical memories. A marvelous family day, indeed."},

This is his scene, without doubt.Miss Audra? She'd play caregiver to kittens all day long.  She's a mighty good sister tolerating her brother's obsession.  Our dog, Kammie?  Well, she had a mighty fine time rolling in manure, repetitively.  Lucky me.Anyway, thank you so much to my cousins, who took this little farmer under their wing.

You're serious, always serious.  Focused, hardworking, determined and kind hearted.You farm all.the.time. As in 24/7. You wake up with an agenda and get straight to work. Everyday, the BOG calls to see what you're up to and you always have something farming related to tell him. Baling hay, hauling logs, milking cows, tending chickens, planting corn, fixing machinery, dumping dirt, putting up fencing for pastures, getting ready for the county fair, mucking out the barn, harvesting corn, the breeder is coming, there's something that needs hauling....I could go on and on. We have a video of you just over age one talking about tractors.  Tractors were some of the first things you talked about as a new talker, and you haven't stopped since. The things you wanted for your birthday are:  a cow (a real one), John Deere Tractors (real ones and play ones), hitches for your tractors, a wheelbarrow, a wishing well, a weathervane and a boot scrubber.  You're smart, super smart. You are very social and intuitive and remember everything.  Try as we might, you typically have zero interest in playing ball, riding a bike, climbing on the playground. However, you'll sprint to feed scraps to the chickens or to check on your goats. You'll climb fences and pretend to mow the lawn.  Whatever you do must be of working nature and must serve a purpose. You do enjoy making pictures for other people. All forms of art, you do enjoy.  You spend a lot of time cutting tractors from magazines and gluing them to make your own tractor books.You are a foodie. Without doubt. On vacation, we had to eat store bought bread and you whined about it, called it gross.  When we came home, you said \"I'm so glad we finally can have homemade bread again.\"  You also ate soup from a can for the first time while we were on vacation. You said, \"Mama, will this be like lentil soup?\"  Although you have your moments, you do have quite the adventurous palate. Your dream meal would be cinnamon toast (made with homemade bread, naturally), cantaloupe, strawberry ice cream and apple pie.You love to read books and will listen to books/\"read\" to yourself for hours. You like all sorts of books, although books about farm animals/tractors, Richard Scarry books and Berenstain Bears are your tops.Most of the time, you are an excellent big brother to Audra. You take care of her, keep her safe, talk to her, play with her. You have such opinions about clothes. You love things your mama makes. You like jeans and you like John Deere shirts and flannels. Everything else hardly gets worn. Although you definitely love your dad, you are 110% a mama's boy. You *still* cry when I have to leave sometimes.  You will carry on even when I jet out for 20-30 minutes of exercise. You want to go on a bus someday, but only to school if mama can come too.  You want me to be your only teacher.  You still enjoy being carried in a carrier and you sometimes still crawl in bed to snuggle mama. You say that you're never going to get married, you're just going to live with mama forever. You, dear Adrian, bring us so many smiles and so much joy. There's nothing more I enjoy in this life than parenting you and your sister.  I love you and that cute little dimple of yours oodles and oodles.

Hopefully you'll either forgive me for such a silly post or perhaps embrace in the simple beauty along with me. I don't imagine I'll mind pressing these one bit. My little helper opened the door for me as I brought them in.  He didn't want me to spill the basket.  How thoughtful."},

What an event!  I had a good friend try to count people. She said it was well above 50 people, but the little people kept moving, so she lost count. Reminds me of trying to count our baby chicks. ImpossibleTo see last year's event, when we raised money and toys for \"Bags of Love\" to help foster kids, click here: 2013Lots different from last year, but lots the same.  Different games, different treats, different décor, different friends (some of the same too!) and a different charity. But that which was the same is the core of this type of get together.  Outside. Simple play. Animals. Fresh air. Wagon rides. Running. Picking flowers. New friends. Strolls through the field. Laughing. Being a kid.  Dessert. (Okay, so maybe that last one is my personal focus). We were so pleased to have old friends and new friends join us. Friends from afar, friends close by too.  Big kids, little kids. All with smiles, eager to have fun.  And perfect weather with 0% chance of rain. That was a bonus.Best part?  My Adrian wanted to help get chickens for people who want chickens, but can't buy them. Friends who came helped us raise $175.00!  All that money will help people in 3rd world countries start a livelihood of chickens. I took a pictures of the before. And to those of you who wanted recipes:Carrot cake here.Chocolate Zucchini Cake here.Oatmeal Raisin cookie here.Cookie Cake here. I failed to get pictures of the crew, but you can find pictures of the event in motion and a great recap here: http://themommystories-friends.blogspot.com/2014/08/farm-frenzy-special-night-of-simple-play.htmlHere's our farm kids. She picked her outfit. Right down to the boots. And Adrian?  John Deere, naturally.I just love the some of the beautiful creations friends did to decorate our party.  Thankful for the time we had. Thankful for good friends.Thankful for the kind hearts who donated. As the sun set, I said a little prayer, hoping that I'd be able to keep this annual tradition going and keep using our home for the benefit of others. There's just the four of us, but with friends like you helping, we can do big things. Thanks for coming locals, and for the words of encouragement from those unable/too far away to come."},

Not every beautiful picture is actually tasty.  So, I headed to my pal, Staci, from Life at Cobble Hill Farm. I've tried her recipes before...good stuff.  I asked her to give me her top three favorites to try.The first up is \"The Best Chocolate Zucchini Cake\". While I was enthusiastic to try it, I was wondering how she'd top this Chocolate Zucchini cake that is soooo delicious too. I didn't need to worry, they are both completely different cakes once finished and both absolutely, 100% perfection.  There's something about the zucchini that keeps cake from drying out and it brings out the chocolaty flavor.  Highly recommend this. And, you know, in case you have ample zucchini hanging around your house, it's a good way to use it up.  Totally counts as a vegetable too, bonus. It's super easy too.The Best Chocolate Zucchini cake recipe, click here. And tell Staci I sent you!"},

She picked for the whole hour, plus, while we were there.  But her loot at the end of the hour was the top picture posted below.  However, by the time we got to the checkout, all that was left in her bucket was what's pictured in the second bucket below. She proudly presented her bucket up to be weighted alongside ours.

(And I just realized she's wearing a dress I made. <3) And then I spotted all these vintage art prints. Add that to the John Deere puzzle, a couple yards of tulle and some sort of twine for the wedding girl, $6.00 well spent.  A sweet and pretty little feminine room for our little goofball is in the works, just looking for the perfect frames for those prints now."},

Pair that with a little self dressing on his part (always interesting)... and I just can't help but smile at my kids wearing mama mades.   I'm thankful she likes them. He liked them for the first time he wore them, then he decided he hated them.   She liked them so much, she decided to take a 'picture'.  Which she does often (where does she learn that from?). She likes to tote that 'camera' around.  And I'm thankful for my camera loving, flower picking little girl, who also love her mama mades. She might not love what I love forever, but she does right now, which I will embrace, enjoy and remember. This post may seem silly, in a way.  I didn't change much, it's still the same living room. But, I decided I want to record the progression of our living space over the years. My cousin posted a picture a bit ago, asking if I could identify the carpet in a picture as being in the living room of the farmhouse I grew up in.  You know, I couldn't because I didn't remember what we had back then.  Then I felt sad that I couldn't remember, as I want to remember such specifics. So, I decided that I want to take more regular pictures of the spaces we live in, since I just re-arranged it, for no other reason but to remember.  Since this blog is the space I record such memories, I suppose you might just have to bear with me today.  Here is the living space as we love it today, my best shot at a 360. Well, I guess some is new, as I added curtains and tiebacks recently. I found those tiebacks a thrift store for a whopping $5.00 for the set. I put them too high on purpose, to let more light in. And a little thrifted rave.  This new light.  Which obviously isn't new. She wanted $15 at the garage sale. I said $8. She said sold. I still cannot believe I know how to barter.And I love how the nooks in our home are coming about. Lots of homemade and refinished, pretty much in every corner. And a selfie in the living room I created, since I'm not usually the one in pictures.  I think I like this little challenge to myself of documenting the changes in our living space. I think it's pretty neat how spaces grow, change and adapt depending on phases of life.  Perhaps you might join me and take pictures of your living space. You've worked hard to get it to where it is. Might as well snap a few shots to remember it."},

So, Adrian, being the good farmer he is, called the breeder. The breeder came and Bluebell is going to have a calf, but not for a long time. You have to wait a long time for a calf, you know. So, while we're waiting, it's best to make a pasture.  The fencing has to be good fencing, because farmers do what is best.  Meanwhile, Audra's baby is crying. So she bounces her to make her happy.Once baby is happy, Audra is sent off to collect white clover. White clover is Bluebell's favorite. This went on for most of the afternoon, this business of pretending together.  Well, until Audra got a call on her calculator....errr...cell phone.

{"title": "Gardening 2014: Take five.", "date": null, "text": "Gardening 2014Take One here.  Take two.Take three. Take four.Garden, oh garden, you bring about such range of emotions for me.  I go out there and want to feel success. But instead, all I feel is inadequate. All I see is weeds, weeds and more weeds. In hindsight, I think we should have bought the smaller rototiller so I could handle it. I wish I dragged my husband out there to rototill.  I wish I made more time for weeding. I wish I spaced this better. I wish I tended this better.  I wish I started this earlier. I wish I planted more of that. I wish I kept better tabs of little feet in the garden. I wish these weeds were gone. I wish I had a show garden.The fact is, I don't have a show garden. Not even close to it.  It is not pretty, well maintained or impressive.  It's far from what I wanted.  I want to do well at that which I set out to do, it's so easy for me to feel defeated in that garden space.   I don't know why I concentrate on the negative when I enter that space, for there's far more positive.I bought a scale this year, thus far, we have harvested, consumed or preserved 111 pounds of our own produce.  Each meal now, 3x a day, has something from the garden.  Home grown, fresh picked=beyond delicious.   And my kids know where their food comes from.  They can identify the plants. They know when to pick and how to pick. They carry the produce in.   They get out their little kid safe knives and chop.  They know these foods are good for their body and they actually eat it.   The other day, I had a salad with kale, collard greens, green onion, peas, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers....and my kids ate the whole thing.  I'm bringing in food regularly and we have enough to eat and we've even had a little extra to share.   I've been avoiding a gardening post for a whole month now, as it's not really something I want to share in the state it's in. But, I'm glad I did, for the last paragraph reminds me that even though the journey getting this produce hasn't resulted in anything show worthy in an aesthetic manner, but it has produced something award worthy in the form of the knowledge in my kids' little noggins.  And flowers, how can I forget those?  So many perennials and my first go around with dahlias and gladiolas.  Always a fresh bouquet around this place. I guess there's more to celebrate right there. Bottom line, message to self-You're doing fine. Just fine.  Yes, your garden might not be perfect, but you read 12 books to your kids yesterday, played 7 rounds of 'going on a bear hunt', dressed baby dolls and hitched tractors to their wagons.  There's plenty of time for a show garden, but just right now to be the best mama to a 2 and 3 year old.  Keep on keeping on.  You can't give up now. The elderberries will be ripening anyday now."},

And during all this, they both had the sounds going.....brrrrrrrr. A simple wooden toy, a few silks and a whole world of imagination.  It wasn't just this day either, it's been a frequently used piece of equipment.  I tell you, I'll be most delighted if this isn't 'just a phase' for either of them.  I'll happily sew along with you, little ones."},
{"title": "Rain..Rainbow. Sunshine.", "date": null, "text": "There's been passing rain in Maine.  The skies open, buckets drop. Warm rain for our garden, and for littles to play in.I grew up in a close knit town. I went to the same K-12 school with the same 41 other kids. Coincidentally, my parents and all my aunts and uncles as well as most of my cousins are graduates from the same school. Almost all my family lives there.  We pop into each others houses unannounced. Sometimes we leave treats and notes even if the other isn't home. We borrow, we help.  We snack on each other's food.  We run into dozens of people we know in the grocery store.  We wave to the cars that pass.  We depend on each other. We count on each other. We care about one another. When I was first pregnant, I remember panicking.  Not because I didn't want to have a child, we wanted a child with our whole hearts.  I was nervous, really nervous, because I felt very isolated.We had just moved into a cute little house in the Maine woods. A new state for both of us to live in.  We were ecstatic and loved living here. Problem was, it was so secluded that no one even knew the place changed hands. No one welcomed us to the neighborhood. No one waved when they went by. No one knew our names.  We were living in this little house in the woods, alone.  I remember thinking, \"I'm bringing a child into this world without any supports.\"  My family a day's worth of travel, my husband's a plane ride away in the winter. And I was having a September baby.  It felt a little overwhelming.Sometimes when one goes into a mode of feeling inadequate, the panic continues.  Not only were we living in a new town, in a new state and knew no one, but our social life was, well, nonexistent. I was newly out of graduate school and pouring every ounce of my energy into work.  I was helping many kids, working 10-12 hour days five days a week. We both had 2nd jobs on the weekends because we were very driven to be debt free (except the mortgage) before kids.  Other than spending time with each other, at home, we didn't do much. Thinking of all this, I felt so inadequate. I am a social person, but didn't know anyone locally yet, how was I going to socialize my kid?!I guess it's good that I had all those feelings back then. It motivated me to welcome myself to the neighborhood. I baked for all the neighbors, and what do you know, we have fantastic neighbors!  I befriended many, I'd visit and bring treats.  Cars started waving when they saw me on my daily runs.  We got invites to dinner.  If I met someone interesting, I invited them over. I got brave and joined a Maine moms group-and many, many of those fabulous ladies are my good friends now. Four years later, just yesterday, I was reminded how blessed I am.  Set of neighbors #1 came over with dessert bars (thank you!), then two fantastic Maine families came over for a morning playdate. Then neighbor #2 came over, delivering scraps to feed our chickens (thank you!) and then a friend from college and her family were in the area and came for a playdate that afternoon too.  And all that went on, I totally ran out of time to walk neighbor #3's cookbook back to her (oops, sorry!).  Not only that, as I'm getting the mail, neighbor #4 waves.  We're eating dinner and we holler 'hello' at neighbor #5 as he runs past.  And with all that, we also chatted it up with new neighbors who bought bread (sold out again!).  And, did you see about our next event?  We're having our annual Country Lovin' Kids charity next Monday, with simple games, good snacks and friends to help a charity. Last year we had over 50 people come, this year there's 13 families coming thus far!  My panic four years ago was over nothing.  Isn't that how most stressful times end up?  Frivolous worry. Sort of like when the rains, sometimes it rains hard. But the rain always dwindles and then disappears.  And if you're lucky, you can see the rainbow straight away. We've been blessed with multiple rainbows just this year.Worry not, friends, there's many more rainbows in our futures.  And when the rainbow is gone, there's little snippets of reminders here of the beautiful things in live, as long as we notice.  Like the remnants of summer juxtaposed in the picture below. Toys and music from good times spent and a bee balm plot started: red from neighbor #1, pink from neighbor #3 and purple from neighbor #6.  It's a good life, it really is. Nothing to worry about. I'm quite happy here. We live in vacationland, after all. It's Maine, the way life should be."},

I knew it was a temporary solution, but come on now, little chicks. Give your farmer a break.Yeah, so not going to happen.  The lucky part about this farm is we have plenty of space. I had options. I could move the chicks to the coop above the garage.  Dangerous flight of stairs multiple times a day and too hot up there.  Or I could make better walls where they were.  Except we would have to buy materials. I finally looked at my husband and said \"We have a perfectly good room with four walls IN the barn that's filled with junk. Let's clean that out.\" Umm....my enthusiasm was not contagious at all. In fact, I think he thought it was a terrible idea. I know for a fact he thought I was crazy.  Thing about me, I ignore him and do my own thing. Which meant a mask, garbage bags and a TON of work.  You see, this room was so jam packed with junk that you couldn't step foot in it. As in the whole entire room.  Broken glass everywhere. Lots of beer bottles. Lots of old grain bags the mice had a ball in. Lots of hay and dust and grossness.  This took days to complete.  Mostly because the glass meant I had to go slow.  And I tell you, I was sore for a couple days. It looks like it's not a big deal, but it was, trust me. And now, insert the chimes, we have this: It looks like it might have been a milking parlor at some point.   It even has a hatch that opens to the underside of the barn. Perfect for dumping manure.And the task of catching 47 baby chicks? Really, not a big deal with Audra. She's the quickest of us all at catching them. And now, they have two windows and a whole bunch of space to roam. All 47 of them.Bonus? Well, when we were cleaning everything out, there were treasures. Old papers with notes, old tin cans that held coffee and the like, lots of harvest baskets, a couple other random wooden boxes.  I hollered for my husband to help when I found couple things that were whole. Imagine my delight to find these:A duckblind (I ripped off most of the burlap) A HUGE solid table. Guessing they used to use it for slaughter?  Not sure, but it's the appropriate height. And...squeee....a HUGE grain bin!  I mean, it's huge and marvelous!  I need my dad to help me fix the top and a compartment or two.  But it's huge and awesome!  Like everything else we've found here, the mice have had a field day.  I need to do some major cleaning, but how fun is this?! There's also two of these.  They are adjustable.  Any idea what they are? Now our chicks are happy in their home. And I'm pretty happy that it is a perfectly good place for them to grow in. There is no emergency to get them into better quarters now. Phew.Although they are happy at home, they still are the luckiest chicks around given the great adventures they go on."},

I remember playing with annual friends at the beach as a kid. I didn't realize that I could do this program in Maine.  When I found out we could, I knew it was for me, particularly when my husband said \"sure\" straight away.  We have the perfect place for a city mouse to experience the country mouse lifestyle.  At least that was my hope.To be honest, all the conversations I've had about this program haven't ended up positive and that makes me sad. There's nothing but positives about this program in my eyes. I debated on whether or not to share anything, but, I did share a little with some friends. And that little bit of sharing resulted in 3, yes THREE, families who have already signed up online. That's not all, another few have sent me messages asking for further information, as they are potentially considering. So, I decided to share our experience in hopes that perhaps one more person/family may consider helping out.  Perhaps by hosting, financially or even prayers...however you see fit if it's in your heart.So I share, although I will not share all.  For it's not my story to share. It's his.  And although we love him dearly, he has a family who loves him in NYC.  His face isn't ours to share with you. It's theirs.  I can promise you that we have oodles of pictures with his big toothless grin. Pictures that your heart would melt at if you saw.  Regardless, we are so incredibly grateful to provide him with an experience that we all felt was wonderful. And he will always hold a special place in our heart.  Having him here was marvelous, truly marvelous. This was his first time to the country and watching him experience it was heart warming. We will indeed be opening our home to more children (later this summer, perhaps?).  My heart has plenty of room for more love, I'm hopeful we can keep offering our home and unconditional love. From this point forward, I think the pictures tell the story of the experience. I hope your heart is as full as mine looking at them. <3  Although we did all this fun stuff, his favorite part of the week was making bread.  Oh, little boy, next year when we return, we will make all the bread you want. <3  (Mud puddle stomping)"},

Well, that picture went all around facebook and got a lot of love.  And I got a ton of Emails asking if I sold them. Selling coops isn't in the cards, it's a heavy item to mail.  But, I wondered if I could create something else that was a simple, marvelous chicken play item, that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg to mail. So, here you have it, something that I've been working on for the last 2 months-a simple play toy that invites imagination and encourages pretend play, made by me, just for you and your little farmer (s).  You can find them at etsy at https://www.etsy.com/shop/bornimaginative or you can just click the \"for sale\" tab above. Here they are!Introducing:  Hennies.  Hennies are sweet chickens with gentle dispositions, fresh from the brooder, and eagerly awaiting you to adopt.  These girls are hand crafted by a chicken loving mama.  Each hen has at least some part of her upcycled (such as fabric/felt scraps, thrifted  clothing, ribbons from gift bags, the interiors from laundered pillows,  etc.), and therefore each may be a slight variation from the picture  shown. They are upcycled to be environmentally conscious and to keep the prices down for the adoptive farmers.  Meet Bloom!Bloom is one of many. Each comes with one hen (first picture shown Height 3in, Width 1 3/4in Depth 4 in.), an upcycled origami nesting box (from paper bags), wool hay and a wooden egg. They also come with a birth certificate detailing their date of birth, their breed and the unique and special details specific to their breed. Certificate is as follows:Name: _______________Date of Birth: _____________Breed: BloomLikes: Watermelon and flower topsFavorite Season: SpringLays: Light brown eggsThese chickens fit perfectly in the palm of your hand and are perfect for little boys or girls. (Small parts, not for children under 3). You can buy just one (it fits perfect in one's purse for restaurants/doctor visits) or you can collect more of the same breed or one of each breed to fill your coop.  Stop by again, as more breeds may become available. If you see one you like, make sure to purchase it straight away, as some breeds are endangered of becoming extinct. Collecting is best, as hens do prefer living in a flock.Imaginative play, simple toys and creativity are such joys of childhood. Adorable moments of play are sure to be in your future with these little gems.

Our toes are sandy sometimes daily.  I loathe crowds and we do live in vacationland, so noontime swimming is not my thing.  But, something magical happens here around 4pm.  People pack up. Be it back to the hotel, campsite, out to dinner, evening shopping, tourists are gone. Which leaves empty beaches, just the way I like to enjoy the coast. Similarly, I grew up with quick evening dips at our camp on the St. Lawrence River.  This is from last year, but worth viewing again. So peaceful, serene. Can't get a better sunset.  There's something magical about an evening along the water.  Especially on hot/humid days, a quick dip cools your body down, sometime making the air conditioner at home unnecessary.  Being outside during those longer days makes one appreciate the gifts of summer.  The relaxed pace invites more conversation.  I am always glad I went upon returning those evenings.  I fondly remember my evening dips as a child, I hope my children will remember their evening dips.I rarely bring my camera when I go, but I decided to this once, and I'm glad I did."},

{"title": "Gardening 2014: Take Four", "date": null, "text": "Gardening 2014Take One here.  Take two.Take three.  Goodness, here we are at take four.  The garden, oh that garden. You know what I'm growing? Weeds, that's what.  Let me tell you what's frustrating about gardening for me.  1) I want to have a picture perfect garden. I want no weeds, a cute little fence, my raspberry hedge just so, more raised stone beds, a gardening shed with perennials. I want my soil to be fantastic and not the mess it is right now. I want beautiful mulch. And I want to grow enough to share with everyone. There's a lot that I want. But, the truth of the matter is it's just me taking care of this garden. And I just cannot do it all.  2) I like success. I feel triumphant when I know how to do something and defeated when I fail.  I have grown peas a number of years successfully. Only the deer have come and dined on every.single.pea plant. They nibbled the tops off, which of course ruined the entire thing. They also came and ate 14 of my cauliflower plants.  Those are the cauliflower plants I started in March. Cauliflower and peas are two vegetables I KNOW how to grow, and yet I failed. And because of said weeds, I really stink at growing carrots and leafy greens this year. I've grown them successfully before, sure. But there's problems now. Because, well, you need to weed those. I know how to grow those, but I'm not getting in there as fast as the weeds.  Goodness, this happens every year, this feeling of defeat.  Again, I need to remind myself to step back.  Because I again find myself concentrating on my failures.  And truth be told, a gardener who has been gardening for decades still has failures depending on the year.  There's pests and critters and weather that you cannot control.  So it's okay if everything isn't coming as planned. I need to remind myself of why I am gardening.  Am I gardening for show garden purposes? Clearly not.  I'm gardening to feed my family. I could have a smaller garden that is more manageable and would look prettier, but then I'd have less for my family. Last year my preserved herbs lasted me all year and my frozen veggies lasted until March.  There is still a plethora of food coming our way from said garden. I just need to be patient. I need to remind myself of my priorities.  I try to do everything in moderation, which, as life has it, includes gardening. I haven't spent my entire evenings gardening, but I get out there when possible.  My kids still eat homemade meals 3x a day.  I have been getting a few more runs in lately. I made a sweet little gift for Miss Audra's 2nd birthday.  Two sweet flour girl dresses are hung in my kitchen now.  I've read to my kids daily.  I've pushed them on the swings and I've gone down the slide with them. I skipped weeding in favor of family beach time. Moderation.  I need to remind myself that I'm doing okay.  Things are growing and my kids are thriving. Not counting what we consumed out there, I have brought 17 pounds of produce into the house thus far. So it's not a failure.  There will always be another weed, but there won't always be two little kids asking for one more book. And so, I will read that one more book, I will let the weeds grow.  And I will celebrate all that is growing instead of wallowing in what is not. And here's the garden as of now.  (There's blossoms, do you see?!) They are coming! Not a hornworm yet, knock on wood. Snacks. And beauty. And dreams in (another) secret garden that I hope to get to one of these days. And harvesting. So much goodness. (Two gallons of these flash freezed in trays for the winter. Mmm!) Meals have been grand, even if 100% of the contents aren't grown by us...yet.  Just a bit of garden fresh makes any meal better though.  So there you have it, the good of our garden.

Lots of them!  In a moment of defeat last month when our cat turned our incubator up to 117 and cooked our baby chicks, I ordered. And then in our incubator, I wasn't assuming I'd get many.  They say eggs are only viable for 10 days, I had up to 20 day old fertilized eggs that hatched just fine.  Don't believe what they say about not being viable is the lesson I learned.  And then we have some from our last hatch.And then a friend had one lone chick that hatched in their last incubator fail that we took in.And then we, of course, have our adult chicks.

We do have a second coop that we kept for the purebreds to breed, but I've been cleaning that out, getting ready for moving them all. It will all be happening soon, they grow so fast!  And goodness, they eat so much!But being a chicken farmer is quite fun, I'd say.  We love our girls. Especially Audra.  She would love to be holding onto a chick 24/7. She'd sleep with them if we let her. She's always hugging them and talking to them. Adrian loves them too, but he likes to care for their needs, and then he's on to his other 'farming' responsibilities that he creates for himself (latest is he's been fixing his 'machinery'). Okay, so onto the fluffy chick pictures: Our babies, part from our own incubator, part from mail order:And our next born:  And our teens, goodness, they are funny looking at this stage: And then our well loved layers. And our best egg collector.  And one crazy chick, and her hen. Never thought I'd turn into a chicken lady.But here I am, with quite the flock.  And I must say, I like the chicken life quite a bit."},

Not 20 questions, 2000 questions.  All in a row. Goodness, I don't even know half the answers to his questions, but he just keeps going.  Needs all the info he can gather about farming, that's for sure. Alas, the questions stop...and off we go. Off to get his sister, who just *must* come see. Well, I guess she was dragged. And let me tell you, she got her own lesson on what was happening on the way. She was excited to get on. And he, of course, couldn't let her get on by herself.  Now that wouldn't be right, she's so little and all.

Adrian asked her if her children would be coming home now. He was worried to enter the Three Little Bears' House.  He was afraid they would come back from their walk soon. He didn't want them to catch him.He asked Mother Goose if she'd read \"Wee Wee Winkie.\"  The 2nd day we went, he really wanted to bring his own book to read with Mother Goose.He told Little Bo Peep that he hopes she finds her sheep.  He told Peter Rabbit he needs to listen.He scolded every wolf statue/figurine he saw. It was all so real, he was so serious and so concerned.  He totally loved the magic of Storyland. Until, of course, he saw a cow that you could pretend to milk.  And then nursery rhymes went by the wayside and he returned to his farming roots.  He 'milked' that pretend cow for a half hour before we dragged him away.Our Audra? She enjoyed it all too.  She didn't get the nursery rhyme part, but she does love seeing animals. Our 'mother hen'. \"Hi goose!  You okay? I Audra. I take care of you.

My most vivid memories of flower picking are going for walks with my grandmother.  She always had wildflower bouquets on her table, most often picked by her grandkids.  I would also pick with my mom. We'd fill entire baskets when daisies were in bloom and then deliver them to nursing home residents.  I remember my mom helping me make dandelion crowns, that I would sport with pride. I remember picking a favorite flower to tuck behind my ear as I was walking back to our pond to catch frogs. I remember going on walks along side of the road or in the pasture with my dad and he'd help me label the wildflowers.  I loved picking flowers with all of them and I have always loved a bouquet on the table. Just about 365 days a year, there's a bouquet resting in the middle of our dining table.  Most often, home grown and hand picked from our yard, but I tend to splurge on flowers mid winter.  A little color and scent has always made a house a home. So many of these spring days, my littles are drawn to hand picked beauty.  They collect and I help them label.  Right now, we have daisies, dandelions, buttercups, vetch, red and white clover, all of which they know. Naturally, there's always a bit of hay in such vases as well, seeing as I birthed a little farmer.  Their arrangements fill vases upon vases. Little bits of beauty pop up in every room. Just last week, there were 8 cups filled with dandelions in the upstairs bathroom.  \"They are for you to enjoy, mama.\" And that I do.           Are there flowers on your table?

Those weeds do want to grow. We have been harvesting.  Thus far, six pounds of produce have entered our home.  The majority of it has been kale. Breakfast and dinner have been kale all week. Kale frittatas or fruit smoothies with kale for breakfast. Dinner has included kale chips, sautéed kale, salad and lots of kale tossed in a marinara sauce. No one is complaining (yet). In fact, they even eat the kale just plain from the garden.  Case in point, right here. Rhubarb is what else has been plentiful, particularly with seven patches of rhubarb on the property (oh my). Lots of rhubarb desserts and four batches of strawberry rhubarb jam all canned.We've traded our lilacs for daisies and phlox.  And more flowers are sprouting each day. So much color! And the lawn is growing, well, like a weed. My biggest accomplishment as of late is the ginormous secret garden I'm digging out. Six heaping truckloads of brush.  Thick thick brush that one could hardly move through. Yards and yards of said brush.

Not sure if it's different brands or if this is an oops, but it's snugger than I had intentioned. Anyway, your free pattern is HERE. Never mind that, he's super happy with it.Which ensued a dance party. The entire tugboat is made with upcycled cotton knit clothing. The beauty of applique with knits is they don't fray. So you don't need a zig zag to secure it. Just a straight stitch will suffice. Makes for a quick applique (although do get ball point needles, they make a world of difference with jersey type fabrics).He was so happy that he posed.

He's always concerned if someone's not fixing it up. He worries about old structures falling.  He talks about how he's going to help. Usually, we see these dilapidated structures in passing in our car. However, this one, we saw on foot.He noticed it and wanted to walk over to it.  There he stood, minutes upon minutes, just inspecting.  He spoke of his concern, he wondered why no one was helping it.  Mostly, though, he just stood there quietly. Possibly sizing up the situation? Perhaps dreaming of what it used to be?  Perhaps dreaming of what it could be? Finally, he shared his solution.  \"BOG is going to come and help him fix it up so it won't fall to pieces.\" Nevermind we don't know the owners, this isn't for sale...and there's dozen of other logistic and financial obstacles that make a project as such impossible for us.

I know, I know, I do it to myself.  I don't really 'need' to do it all, but I want to.  I want to feed my family homegrown and from scratch. I want to get my hands dirty, be tired at the end of the day from hard work, have a full root cellar and all my mason jars full.  I want a big bountiful garden that will give us delicious fresh meals over the summer. I want to have enough to share. I want fresh colorful bouquets on my table at all times. I want it to be big and beautiful and prolific. Only planting takes an eternity with helpers. I pretty much planted for an hour or two every.single.day. that I wasn't working the month.And today, I'm celebrating because I'm planted. What's planted?Herbs: Cilantro, Dill, Basil (lots!), Oregano, Chives, Parsley, Mint, Lemon Mint, Thyme, Rosemary.Veggies: Peas, Cauliflower, Broccoli, Cabbage, Kale, Greens, Carrots, Parsnips, Asparagus, Garlic, 5 different kinds of tomatoes (one being cherry)-65 plants planted in all!, peppers, eggplant, 4 different kinds of onions, red and white potatoes, 3  different kinds of beans, swiss chard, collard greens, more random  greens, brussel sprouts, 2 different kinds of cukes, zuke, summer squash, spaghetti  squash, butternut squash, acorn squash, 2 diff. kinds of corn, sugar  pumpkins.Fruits:  Five different kinds of apples planted, blueberries, heirloom raspberries, two different kinds of grapes and elderberries, strawberries, peach, pear, plum, cherry.  And 7 different rhubarb patches. Is rhubarb a fruit or veggie?  Who knows.Annual flowers: Cosmos, glads, morning glory, sunflowers, marigolds, dahlias (traded friend eggs for dahlias....thank you!). Perennial flowers: Too many to list! All veggies were started from seed except I randomly picked up brussel sprouts (forgot about them), parsley (rototilled under by accident) and peppers (seedlings were small).I tried saving seeds from last year and I had success with beans, peas, cilantro, 4 tomato, cherry tomato, 3 squashes,  pumpkins.  No luck with peppers, broccoli, zucchini, summer squash, eggplant and some flowers.Overall, now that things are in, it's so exciting to see growth!  Such great promise.  My tomato seedlings are the perfect size for planting.  (Oh, and I got new Wellies!  She thinks they are fab too!)Above:  Beans are coming, peas promising, lots of onions and the tomatoes are already so high!Above: Lots of basil, kale, broccoli (I think!), direct seed pumpkin sprouts.As I go through pictures, I'm surprised that I really didn't take any of my little planters. I think I was so nervous that their little feet would stomp where they didn't belong that I forgot to capture the beautiful moments-particularly when they were planting the corn and beans with me one by one, as they were digging their holes with their little shovels next to me, or when they filled their dump trucks to haul rocks away.  Although I was on guard, it really is nice having me interested. Yes, a few seedlings may be lost in the way, but they are learning right along with me, and for that I am thankful.And the view from upstairs in our home, a view they see from both of their bedrooms.  A marvelous view, I'd say. Random tidbit: My other new purchase is that fancy scale.  I'm hoping to weigh my produce and see how many pounds I produce.  A great way to compare year to year.  All these dirty boots lined up also makes me happy.And onto the other gardens.  This place is over run with secret gardens, which is fab and overwhelming.This particular one looked like this: Arching over our driveway, the whole length of it. Hours and hours and numerous scratches later, it looks like this: I can't even tell you how many hours this was in work. But, do you see the marvelous wall uncovered?!You wouldn't even have known it was there!This is where the concord grapes grow...do you see the size of the vines?!Which they haven't had much space.  Hopefully they will do better. Most of the blackberries (planted, not wild) were woody. I totally cut them back and they are improving. Progress here, for sure! Now I'm going to sit and wait. See how it does this year. See what else I will cut back and what I will leave. It's so nice to see the wall though!And now...to this secret garden.  Feet and feet and feet and feet of overgrown forsythia.  You should see the piles I already have gone through. Do you see the white lilacs? Can't get to them, but want to!  That's the goal.At the very end, this is the granite bench I want to get out.  But first, I must clear that forsythia.  Lots of projects, indeed.  But also, we have a plethora of color to enjoy too.  Our black chestnut trees are in full bloom. You can hear the bees buzzing under them from afar.  Lilac and lily of the valley. Best smells ever.  And the \"Pig squeak\" is so beautiful now.I'm tucking vases of color everywhere around here.  After the long Maine winters, a bunch of colorful cheer is just what we needed.Goodness, I've rambled along enough. What is going on in your garden?"},

I followed her, doing what she wanted to do, at the pace she wanted. You know what we did?  We spent much of our time in the craft station, coloring construction paper with markers.  ﻿ And then I went back in my mind to think about her interests.  She DOES like to create. Back in winter, she was the one who wanted to sew fireside.The papermaking class that we took was for age 3 and up, but she was the one who was most interested. Stickers. Markers, with these tiny intricate detailed pictures. Beadwork.  I'm sure I could go on if I went through the picture archives. In fact, when I think of it, I purposely placed my hope chest and, paper and crayons on the other side of my sewing machine. She creates along with me.  And she loves to reorganize my pin cushions. Although she's not supposed to go through my sewing machine, I found her like this the other day, removing and piling all contents after inspecting each one.And she's the one who is eager to show me what she made at the library each week.  Now, if she continues this creative interest, you can guess there will be one mama who will be beyond thrilled.Creating together sounds like a bright future to me! ﻿"},

Silly, perhaps, to be elated about a clothesline, but I love it. I love the rhythmic motion so early in the morning. I love talking with my kids about their plans for the day when there's still dew on the ground. I love the quietness of the morning, filled only by little voices, a cockadoodledoo or the squawking from a chicken laying an egg. A full line swaying in the breeze makes a house feel like home.  The scent of line dried clothes in our home is a scent that promises summer. Sunned diapers always look so fresh and white.  Not to mention cheaper and eco friendly.Oh, the memories of my littles underfoot as I hung the clothes. (First him, then her.)I remember mentioning once to an acquaintance, \"I hope it doesn't rain, my clothes are out.\"  She said \"Oh, that's too bad you don't have a dryer, they are expensive.\"  \"Umm, I have a dryer and I like to hang my clothes out.\"  You can imagine her quizzical look. (Last spring)Yes, I hang my clothes because I enjoy it. Why am I talking about this today? Because there's four cord of wood sitting right in the way of my clothes line and there's more wood on the way, dumping in that exact spot. Beautiful weather in Maine and I cannot hang out my clothes until the wood is stacked.  And so I find myself out there stacking wood as the sun is rising and sneaking in a little more stacking as the sun sets.  Two kids underfoot, naturally.  I will move this wood and get my clothesline back! The freshly line dried scent is apparently good motivation.

But, there's a lot of heartache on others. It was one of those days of heartache yesterday, one that I just felt defeated.  Such days are when I question what we're doing.  I am supposed to be the adult in charge, but I sometimes feel so helpless and clueless. I wonder if I really am cut out for this lifestyle. Sometimes there's a lot of work with little or no gain or a big loss.  Sometimes things happen beyond my control. I'm not only thinking of recent events on our farm, but also our dear friends who are saying goodbye to such a faithful and loving companion today. I come to you today with such a heavy heart. Life really would be much simpler if it wasn't filled with feathered and furry critters.  But then I look at pictures such as these:Pictures of not just any kid having fun,   but pictures of MY kids having fun.Yes, they experience heartache too, but they also have such remarkable strength to just bounce back.  They spend much more time enjoying what they have  and they spend much less time focusing on what they lost. There are moments of heartache, yes, but the moments to treasure far outweigh the sad times.  Then I feel mighty silly questioning whether this lifestyle is for us. Of course it is. We have big hearts capable of loving and we also have the strength to let go. What's more is we are willing to give a little love to critters again and again, knowing that our hearts will become saddened again. With the amount of love in this family, we simply must share it.  Sending virtual hugs to our dear friends saying goodbye to such a special furry friend.

Seriously, how is a farmer to decide? We ended up with the cows. He was pumped. BOG was with us, a treat for us. (Although given he's a large animal veterinarian, it likely felt like another day of work for him, but whatever).  Somebody was mighty excited. Not only do they have Holsteins (his 2nd favorite), but they had Jerseys too (his first favorite). And they had this scavenger hunt where you had to go and find the answers to cow trivia at various parts of the farm. This little guy can sputter off the fast facts about these cows. Holsteins give the most milk because of their big udders and Jerseys have milk that's good for butter making and cheese. Cows have four stomachs. They eat corn silage and hay silage. Heifer means they haven't given milk yet. Dry means their milk is all dried up and gone. This kid is up on his cow trivia, let me tell you.    Sweet girl is getting a little less intimidated by cows the more she sees them. Kind and gentle creatures, yes ,but they look giant to her. This kid? He's a home in the barn. Always. And the calves. Sweet girl likes the calves. They are more her size.  He wanted to take this one home.And this? You see this pile of manure? Well, after seeing it, he found a farmer and told the farmer that he had a manure spreader at home and next time he came, he was going to bring that manure spreader and help them spread all that manure. He's helpful this one, I tell you. Here he is telling me all that he's planning on doing to help. And then they had this little pretend to milk cow.Which she thought was fabulous.  She probably spent a good 20 minutes milking. We all sat and relaxed while she got busy. Which was a nice break, as the majority of the time, wherever she goes, she's like this picture below. In full sprint. Notice how neither foot is touching the ground.  And the other thing they love? Boot cleaner things with brushes. I don't know what it's called. But Adrian has put it on his Christmas list. Whenever we see them, the kids spend a good 10 minutes making sure their shoes are mighty clean.   He finished his scavenger hunt and got a nice little prize pack. And we scooted over to watch the horses next.  Which she says \"Mama, I want ride horse. Please mama?\"And he says he's just going to have draft horses, doesn't she want draft horses with him?  She's not swayed. She wants to ride a horse. Someday you will ride, sweet girl.

Love having my own herbs.I am thrilled that my hired hand (who works for cookies) helped me rototill.  I'm lucky enough to get a ladybug and a dog to help me.     Last year I was asked by a few people the dimensions of my garden. I actually measured this year. This is the garden area-bordered by raspberry bushes, rhubarb, apple trees and blueberry bushes.   To the left is the 4x6  herb garden I just showed you and the strawberries.The main garden is 46x46feet.   This is the side garden is 28x28 inches.  I haven't planted much ouside. Just some peas, greens, carrots, swiss chard and parsnips thus far. But I'm itching to plant more. Cauliflower, Broccoli, Kale and Cabbage seedlings are the next to plant.  Sometimes I worry I'm not doing enough, how great the results will be, if I'm missing a step or a page from the Farmer's Almanac.  Really, I shouldn't worry.  There's plenty of time to plant. The lilacs haven't even bloomed. It's not so pressing that I can't enjoy precious sites of my tiny gardeners. The process really quite fun in and of itself, especially when you have two littles in costumes.     As I did last year, I'll try to update you on progress. I can't wait to create some delicious meals with freshly home grown produce. Summer meals are the best."},

The faded wall paper looked so dingy in real life.It looked like this to start.  Honestly, I hadn't done much of anything with it. It was that room that we tossed things in when we moved.  Finally, I cleared it out and lost motivation.  Perhaps two months ago now, I painted it and again lost motivation.  I don't know why I was having such a hard time motivating myself.  Redid some chairs (told you about it  Here ) and then quit again.One day, I discovered a TON of black frames at my fave thrift store.  I bought a whole bag full of frames (13 of them for $17!) and thought this was the writing on the wall that I needed to finish the room.  Again, the art sat piled in the room.

{"title": "Easter Reveal & New playset. Random thoughts. Oodles of Thrifteds. ", "date": null, "text": "It occurred today that I meant to post their Easter baskets, but I did not. It's still April, so totally not too late (I hope). Today's post totally comes with a warning. It's crunchy granola-eco friendly, cheap and simple. But, I am who I am, so here's my ramblings.  1) Easter Baskets.  Except for a couple crafty type things, they were 100% homemade, thrifted or upcycled. Even the big Easter baskets. Except for the small encapsulated sponges, the rest was all non-plastic.  And this little created playset certainly was the showcase. Zoom clearly thought all this stuff was his.Verdict? They loved it.  2) Random Thoughts. Yes, almost all of their baskets were filled with thrifted stuff. Why do I do that?a) They are equally as excited about the stuff that I get them used as they would be if I filled my cart at Walmart. I like teaching them that we don't need expensive or fancy to be thankful. b) Cost. Reducing outcome has given me the ability to reduce my hours at work to part time. We also had a whole year (last year) when we owned two houses.  With paying for two homes (and all the things that have gone wrong in both houses), I was unsure if we would be able to afford to give our kids anything for Christmas. I began going to Thrift Stores more often to make sure our kids would have something to open for Birthdays and Christmas. (And now I'm more hooked than before.)c) The types of toys. I aim for simple, eco friendly toys and books that develop the imagination.  You can often find things in the thrift store that you can no longer find in department stores.d) Many thrift shops do good things with the money they earn. I'd rather give my $ to a charity shop than a department store.e) I'm into eco friendly. Saving things from the dump, less packaging, etc. f) The hunt is fun!Many people often tell me that I find marvelous things at thrift shops. What are my secrets?a) You need to frequent them. Stop by a couple times a month at least if you can.  It only takes ~5-10 minutes to scan the shelves to see if there's anything you've been looking for. Things are changed up often, keep checking back if you have the time.b) Keep a mental list of what you're looking for. It will help you narrow down your search.c) Patience. Don't be disappointed if you don't find anything on that list when you're shopping. Sometimes I leave thrift stores with nothing. d) If you love it, buy it. If not, carry it around the store and put it back at the very end if you're undecided.  You don't want someone else to snatch it up before you decide.e) Start shopping a long time before you actually need something.  Certain items take a long time to find sometimes. A quick clean when you get home and you can pack it away with your other treasures for future holidays.  It's so worth it, I tell you. I only spent $15/kid on the Easter Baskets posted above...and the kids loved them!I currently have enough stuff for all holidays between now and the Christmas after next in my attic.  This is the loot I got from our PTSA consignment fundraiser this year. These sales happen 2x a year and they are often some of my biggest source of gifts for the later holidays. All of these lots cost between $5.00-$7.50.  Richard scary books. Melissa and Doug tool set add on, Melisss and Doug sewing cards. Sunglasses.  Drum. Wooden refrigerator magnets, preschool game, Paperdolls. fun books.  Wooden play clock. Melissa and Doug puzzle, a John Deere lot. Peter Rabbit stuff. A vintage fire truck, frog family, movies, books. Two puzzles, John Deere tractors, rhyming puzzles, lacing numbers, the book Otis (a fave!). I know some of you might be rolling your eyes at me, as I do get a little intense about thrifting.  But, think of the good stuff and the savings you could be missing out on!  Next time you drive by your local thrift shop, pull in!  And if you aren't lucky enough to have a thrift shop, check craigslist.  If I could convince even one of you to become a thrift shopper, you won't be sorry!"},

{"title": "Cows, cows and more cows. Moo.", "date": null, "text": "I took a vacation day when my husband was in between jobs.  We debated over what fun thing to do.  Many of our options, we concluded would not be as exciting to our kids as it would be to us.  So, what did we end up deciding? A farm, naturally. Given that's 99% of Adrian's interest, we knew he'd be happy. The goal was a farm, with cows. We ended up at Pineland Farm, aka Adrian's Disney.And this is how magical pulling into the farm was for him:We started off with a papermaking class, which I thought would be so fun. He was annoyed. He wanted to see cows. He participated minimally, before needing to inspect the posters on cow breeds. On the other hand, she LOVED it. She did multiple pages. She just kept on creating.A brief tangent...there was this felt board that asked you to classify vegetables if they grew in or above the ground. This kid remembers from our gardening adventure last year. He got them all with no help. (!!) Back to the farm life. She like the chickens. They had hundreds inside. He wanted to go to the cows. Watching cow transports might be equivalent to Splash Mountain in excitement. And then what did we do after that? Cows, cows and more cows.He wanted to greet and feed each one. The farmers kept coming back. You still here, they'd say? Um yes. And after that barn, We went to another barn... And another and another. He held her hand for much of the excitement. He wanted to teach her all about cows. Because they are his favorite, you know. He likes Jersey cows best, but Holsteins are his second best.  Which is good, as they only had Holsteins here. I asked my husband if 10 years ago, I told him he'd be spending all his vacations on farms, what he would think?  He just smiled.  He doesn't mind...because no farms, no food. And goodness, that husband of mine loves food. Onto the horses.But alas, back to the cows.  More cows because it was milking time.  We waited all.day.long for milking.  My husband and I were tired of being there, but not him. He'd move in if they let him.Not sure if this is her thing or not, but she didn't mind being dragged along, so it seemed.He was enthralled with the milking. I think the farmers thought that we were the family who just wouldn't leave.  Which we were, obviously. This, by far, is my fave pic. He's just like his BOG here (who is a large animal veterinarian), hands behind his back, with his baseball cap on, work boots on, walking back and forth along the livestock, silently watching, inspecting and taking notice. (And Audra, being the excellent imitator she is, joined in.)  We finally said we were leaving. He was furious. But alas, we spent hours looking at cows. Hours and hours.  We needed to pull him away at some point. And I can just imagine he had the sweetest of dreams when he crashed on the way home. Dreams of black and white spots, round bales and square bales, udders and silage, gutters and manure. He's a farmer through and through, that Adrian.  To say he loves this stuff would be a gross understatement. And to us? We'll do what he enjoys most, as there's nothing better than giving your child the best day of his life."},

{"title": "Open Farm Days", "date": null, "text": "So...I'm going to try something new. I have had a lot of interest of local parents/kids interested in coming to our little 'farm'.  I am so busy that time just ticks by before I can schedule as many playdates/visits that I'd like.But, I want to share this place and our animals. Our animals are very socialized with kids in particular that it's a great opportunity for kids to enjoy and get used to animals. We have a great piece of property to run in, chase butterflies or spot the train going by. We have dirt to dig, flowers to pick, eggs to collect and giggles to share.I've been collecting a whole bunch of used farm boots.  I have quite a collection. I'm hoping you and your littles will come and pull those farm boots on, get dirty and make memories with us.The first open farm date is Tuesday April 8th from 4-6pm.  What will we do?  Hopefully we will have some baby chicks hatched/hatching from our incubator (they're scheduled for that day to hatch). We'll have the rabbit bouncing around, goats and chickens will be around, our dog will want her belly rubbed, of course.  There's sticks everywhere, so perhaps a fairy house or two can be built, if the weather is nice.  If it's rainy, we have a 3 seasons porch or the barn to keep us dry.I'm also going to have a donation jar out. My kids work to earn the money needed to feed these animals. When the weather is nice, they sell bread roadside. They have sold hundreds of loaves of bread (with my help, of course) to tend their animals. It's really quite fantastic-they go to the feed store with their own little pouch of money. If we have an open farm day, then we won't be able to make bread that day. So, if you have a couple extra dollars, perhaps you can donate to their cause?  Helping to fund the feed for these animals possibly can ensure we can continue to have open farm days for all to enjoy this little piece of country life.  That being said, I don't want to turn anyone away if funds are tight. This is a place where all are welcome, regardless of finances or abilities.I do hope you come. It will be a lot of fun, I promise. And you might want to bring your camera to catch the smiles that will radiate.And future open farm days, (which I hope to have) may include some farm stories, farm songs, fun activities. Who knows? We shall see.  They also may include some of this:Looks fun to me! I hope you can come. (And since this is the first one, could you let us know if you're planning on coming? Thanks!)"},

The dog...well...tolerating the chaos.And I just loved the whole scene.  The two of them, having a blast together.  Making their own game out of nothing in particular. Involving their most favorite pets. Being creative. Having lots of simple fun that doesn't involve technology. Learning, playing, growing together.  It's the good stuff that happens when we give kids unscheduled time to just be.This weekend, I'm going to make sure we're not so busy that we don't have time to just play. Perhaps you'll join me, shut off the technology and make playing an activity of choice this weekend. Let the good times roll."},

And then I thought I needed some accessories. Which I started. And then I thought I needed some wall art. Which is now in a huge pile on the bed.  Progress perhaps, but I seem to be spinning my gears.A sneak peek is better than nothing, I am hoping. I painted the room white, I found this 1910 craft table to park in that spot and (hopefully hide the cords) and the rocker is from a family member. Lots of vintage. Pretty much in line with the rest of the rooms.And a bit more of a sneak peek. That which isn't a disaster.I'll get around to finishing it in the near future, I hope. Until then, snuggles and kisses will take precedence, as it should be.  You won't mind the wait, right readers?"},

Only with Katy's super shy personality, I needed to give her a little time to warm up before presenting her with the paparazzi and her crew. The first day my kids met her, they sized her up...And simultaneously gave her a ginormous hug. Only I'm not sure she was a fan quite yet.  Our friends wanted to re-home her, as she was the bottom of the totem pole at their farm. All the other does were boss and she was so shy and submissive.But now?  Here? She's a perfect fit. Our other goats have let her step in and be the lead. She seems quite happy and has gotten the routine down just fine.And my kids love her. As in really love her. She just stands there and lets them hug her. Forever and ever.Both of them could hug her all day long. Our other goats don't mind quick hugs, but they must have stuff to do, as they move along quickly after their hugs.  But Katy? She just stays there. Our kids tire of the hugs before she tires of hugging. She's a great match for us.So now, we have 2 two-legged kids and 3 four-legged kids.  But, Katy is expecting. She's due May 20th (which would be my mom's birthday if she was living).  I'm nervous, excited, overwhelmed and more about that.

And sprouted. It's marvelous to watch spring sprout right in our very own house. It's that time of year when there's not just herbs on my windowsill (which I have year round). Pile on the re-sprouted celery and green onions. And save those seeds for a matching game. Perfect for your 4-H pals.And while you're at it, start celebrating spring with friends.

In fact, we stayed for hours. You see, they had little lambs, which we do not have at our farm.  The farmers at Wolfe Neck were kind, patient and allowed our little ones to help. Help! Squee! Adrian made it his job to teach Audra about farming and he tried to keep her back from the tractors when necessary. They had so much fun. Adrian proclaimed he could farm their farm as well as his own.  Back to our farm close to home, Farmer Rick heard Adrian wants to farm at Wolfe Neck....and he told Adrian that he belongs at Chase's Farm.  Adrian didn't dispute, he does love Chase's Farm best.But that doesn't mean we still can't have a blast at Wolfe Neck Farm. And a farm, with coastal views. Love. The ram who made all these lambs happen. Welding is fascinating. He was allowed in the brooder.  The farmers were impressed with how slow and gentle he was. Certainly not his first time in the hen house. Nor hers. He marched up to the farmers and asked them where the grill was for the Massey Ferguson. They were surprised he knows his tractors. Keeping her safe. The tractor was coming. Just a snack. He helped.  For about a half hour straight. Of course, keeping close watch on his sister when the tractors were close by. Really, watching them enjoy the lambs were magical. We were tempted to put a couple in our trunk and bring them to our farm. Maybe someday."},

{"title": "Maine Maple Sunday 2014", "date": null, "text": "Oh Maine Maple Sunday...we love you so.This year was quite different from years past.  We started with friends over for a pancake brunch. And then the kids enjoyed our farm animals and collected the sap from our buckets and inspected what we have been boiling down. Just us, no crowds.And then we took off to a new Maple Sunday festival-one at our fave farm only half mile from our home.There were crowds everywhere.  A bit overwhelming, but also exciting that so many people were out to celebrate agriculture and farming.There were dozens of kids in the barn.  We're lucky that our favorite farmers regularly let us hang in the barn, with no crowds.  My kids seem know the drill there, but of course they needed to see the farm animals again. You know, the neatest thing happened.  One of the draft horses recognized my kids in the crowd.  When good old \"Bill\" saw them, he lowered his nose directly to them, ignoring everyone else.  He just stayed there with them for a long time, letting them pet him.  The girl who was holding him said \"You can tell he knows your kids.\" It was really neat.There's a new calf since last week.Who doesn't love an adorable calf?!The line for the horse drawn wagon rides was long, so I convinced everyone to go inside.I am still in awe of their brand new evaporator.  And I might be just a tad jealous. Okay, I am very envious. Audra had popcorn. Adrian refused. He did not want his face painted. He did not want to get popcorn. All he wanted to do was find the farmers and I was ruining his fun.He did quit pouting long enough to have Maine Made ice cream and maple syrup. But as soon as it was done, you know where he wanted to go. One track mind, that kid.We finally got back out to the farm and Adrian was determined to wait in one spot for his favorite farmer. I tried to persuade him to do something else, but he wasn't going to budge. I told him his favorite farmer likely would give him a ride another time. He wasn't going to move. We waited a long, long, long time for a wagon ride.  I am *still* cold from that wait, but he did not complain and would not budge.We even waited through a change up of the team (which was very exciting for him).  Sweet girl was so tired that her daddy brought her for a nap, but Farmer Adrian was not going to budge.When it was finally his turn to go on the wagon, he cut in front of all these people so he could sit right behind his favorite farmer.  Goodness, he loved that ride-seeing all the machinery parked, seeing the different fields and the 750 trees that are tapped.So all of that was exciting. Very exciting.  When we got off the wagon, the crowds dissipated. Not my farmer. He had to watch them unhitch the horses.  And he was planning on sticking around for chores, \"In case the need him.\"  His favorite farmer summoned him for the most exciting part of the weekend.  For this: He got to RIDE the draft horse as they put them back into their stables.  Can you imagine how thrilled he was?! And still is. He just can't believe it.And he even got to brush him after.All in all, it was a marvelous day. Many thanks to our friends who put on a great event.  It also was especially nice staying close to home and doing maple things before braving the crowds.  In fact, that part was such fun that we're thinking of opening it up and having a pancake breakfast/experience our animals and sugaring next year for a few more friends. Not a ton, but a few more. Do let us know if your'e interested!It's a tradition, this Maine Maple Sunday. Here's last year's. I'm sure there will be more adventures next year.  Maple syrup is worth celebrating, perhaps you agree?"},

He didn't mind.And he welcomed both of our babies into the world.He loved all our animals.And was essentially a part of both of my kids' lives as they grew.Always close by, that Harley.He really was a loyal cat who kept us really good company. Cats aren't in our lives forever, surely.  But it's still hard to lose a pet.  I am thankful that Harley had a good life with us.  Now it has been 8 months since we said our goodbyes and I think back of him and smile.  Losing a pet is hard, but the joy they bring us and the memories they leave us with outweigh the heartache, without doubt.  Thankful for the time we had."},

It's cold, sure, but not as bad as that wind whipping across the field. Anyway, here's some progress:I probably spent 20 hours or so removing hay, cleaning stuff up and moving things thus far. And how I did that?  Installed these swings.  Sweet girl likes to spend time in the swing by the hour.  I'd do a couple swipes with the pitchfork, push her.  Then repeat.  The toddler swing was a gift (thank you!) but the monkey bars and the two other swings were from the thrift store.  True!  I found a whole swingset in a box at the thrift store. The plans and the swings and all the hardware to make it-brackets, hooks, etc. For $15. Just needed to buy 4x4s to complete the swingset.  Or have a barn with fabulous beams to use some of the stuff. I also have a big slide that a friend got for us (thank you!). I hope to configure a way to set that up too.This is her *trying* to not fall asleep.  A half \"cheese\".  And the goats keep us company. They're kept in the back.Remember our terracotta pots that I set up at our other house?  A fab, inexpensive shelving unit to store their outdoor treasures? That way every stick, stone, leaf, shell, rock, twig, blade of grass, etc. doesn't need to enter our house.  It can be proudly displayed here. And if it's something yucky and slimy, I don't say you can't keep it. I can just say \"Oh, this would look spectacular on your shelves in the barn!\"  Win-win. Really it is.And our collection of outdoor trucks are easily assessed here.A John Deere calendar, given to us by our friends at the feed store, is the perfect decoration, according to a little farmer I know.He likes John Deere, you know.So the goats are right there and the coop door is right here.Their faves are right there to play with us.Here and there, when she's not swinging...she digs in too.I do have quite a bit to sort through still.This milking parlor could use some work.  I'll get to it, I promise.But for now, I'm going to celebrate the little things.  This barn isn't completely fixed up quite yet, but it's fixed up enough for running, learning, growing and playing.  For now, that's good enough."},

I'll show you what I've been working on tomorrow. Or rather what we've been working on.  Because I seem to do nothing without my helpers.  I wouldn't want it any other way."},

These pictures sum up their personalities perfectly.Since I was in charge of her, all pictures from this point forward are because I was following her.Which is quite fine, as I had fun capturing the mutual love between her and her pup.Nevertheless, the trees are tapped.The sap is running slowly thus far, but we have boiled enough down to have a sample.

{"title": "Mama Made: Fox Shirt (Free Pattern)", "date": null, "text": "A fox shirt. For my 3 1/2 year old.It started from his love of the Gingerbread Man. Goodness, we have read that story dozens of times. I was going to make a fox shirt and add a gingerbread man for him. But then he discovered Chicken Little and fell for Foxy Loxy.  And we've been reading that.  Truth be told, foxes are naughty creatures, but they're so intriguing....and they're cute.  So a fox shirt is what I whipped up. Upcycled too. It was a hand-me-down shirt that had a sticker on the front that peeled off. No longer. It's a fox shirt now.Get your free pattern HERE.And someone had to admire himself. He just couldn't believe it!(She has her own style too, noticeably.) She, of course, wants one too. But I have a dress in the works for you, sweet girl. He's quite happy with his fox shirt. And I'm happy he loves another mama made."},
{"title": "Happy 3 and a HALF!", "date": null, "text": "He's 3 and a HALF!  How fun is 3 1/2?!  Such an exciting time.In case you missed,Here's 3.Here's 2 1/2,  Here he was at 2. Here he was at 18 months.(And before that, I wasn't a blogger).And now to celebrate 3 1/2!Oh, Adrian...what a kid you are.You are so incredibly smart, and serious. So focused and hardworking.  Always a project, always busy, very creative, never bored.You're most serious about farming. You're going to be a farmer, a veterinarian and someone who fixes up old farms, farmhouses, silos and tractors so they don't fall to pieces when you grow up.Everything you do is farming related.  EVERYTHING.  You have been planting corn, haying and plowing all winter long. You love hitches for your tractors.  You love cows. Not just any cows, but you love Jerseys as your favorite, Holsteins as your second favorite and you also like Herefords and Texas Longhorns too. You can rattle off chicken breeds as well. And you take excellent care of ALL of your animals, each and everyday. You're very keen about adding \"lotsa\" animals to our farm.  Because in your eyes, we clearly don't' have enough.  When you ask the children's librarian for any books about cows or tractors, he responds: \"I think you read all the books we have about those topics many times, Adrian. But you can check them out again.\"  Even when you talk about colors, you think about farming. Someone you see at church is wearing green and you assume they must be wearing green for John Deere or red because they must like Farmalls.  When we drive anywhere, your eyes are always peeled for livestock and tractors.  You tell us about your farming dreams when you wake in the morning. You've even had nightmares about wild animals getting your farm animals. Everything, EVERYTHING is farming with you.It's hard to get you to do any gross motor activities. Sports, bike riding, ice skating and the like are all boring to you. But, you'll climb any ladder to get hay. And you'll shovel your goats.  We have to trick you into exercise.Same with fine motor. You could care less about letters and numbers. You will do letters if we spell tractor manufacturers and you want to be able to write not your name-but the word cow. You will count if it's eggs you're counting.  You do like to paint and draw, and you can guess the types of things you always draw. (More farming anyone?!)You love love love Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes.  And your versions are adorable.\"Yankee doodle went to town, riding on a pony. Stuck a feather in a hat and called it macaroni and cheese and went to the county fair.\"You also do 3 Blind Mice, Humpty Dumpty, Little Boy Blue, Ba Ba Black Sheep, among others.  You love books in general and read oodles everyday.You're sometimes a bit picky eating now, but the majority of the time, if we tell you that you grew it, you'll eat it. You are a bread boy. You'd eat an entire loaf. And you love your fruit. Any and all fruits, you'll even eat a whole grapefruit and ask for more!  Your fave dessert is apple pie and you love strawberry shakes. You do love to help in the kitchen, along with many other household tasks.You still hate to be anywhere separate from me. Which is okay, really it is. Because I don't like to be separated from you, either. I love you so incredibly much and am so thankful to be your mama.And just for fun..as you grow... Keep growing and learning, little one.  Continue your love for learning.  I am confident you already are the best farmer out there."},

His farming paraphernalia starts in one room and spills across the whole house. Tractors, cows, bales of hay, etc. Our play room had this magnificent kitchen area, that has been unused for some time due to the farm expansion project.  He's in charge, that's for sure. This little girl has been told her favorite tractors are Farmalls. She can't like John Deere tractors because only he can like John Deere. She's not allowed to like cows because cows are his favorite.  Two people in the same house couldn't both like cows. It's not allowed, apparently.  She's also either the menace who 'ruins' everything or she's the hired help who has to follow orders.  Not that she minds, usually.  She just goes with the flow and does what she's told most often.I wondered...if I got all the farming stuff out and left her with a clean slate, would she go find the farming stuff?  Is she farming because she wants to or because she is told to?  What's her favorite?Out went all the farming stuff. And practically everything else too. Back to basics. A simple stage set.... Four our sweet little girl. It just so happened that he napped (not a usual occurrence anymore) and she woke up early.  She had the playroom to herself. She was most excited.From that point forward, she filled the 'dog' water bowls.   She made coffee. She made soup. She made more coffee. She made pancakes.  She made coffee again.  And she washed all the dishes too.There is something being said for the 'less is more' approach. Take much of it all away, and see what they will play. I do love to watch pretend play.She's been at kitchen play much more often lately.  And he has his elaborate county fair scene in the other room that he's hard at work building.  A farmer never rests, you see.(This is the entrance, naturally).Now there's much going on at the county fair and there's a whole lot of cooking going on in the play kitchen.Lots of good pretend play. That's what childhood is all about. Perhaps you agree?"},

It talks about all the 'projects' daddy does and how the kids help them.  The mom waves from the kitchen. My oldest says \"We help you do stuff like this, mama.\" Indeed you do. Such gender roles are long gone.  I love the pictures though. There's still a tear out in the back, advertising this set...which I picked up at the thirft store a bit ago. Only, I didn't have to mail in four easy payments.  I frequently find my kids curled up and reading this set. It's a quite marvelous collection, if you ever do find it out and about during your travels. And the stamp book. It's filled with loads of old stamps, some from the 1800s.  And Dalmatian came to our super quick lunch.  Updates.I'm on a granola kick again.

Truthfully, I'm not really a fan of painting. However, I do enjoy admiring freshly painted walls. I won't be sad when all is painted, that's for sure. I'm on vacation this week and have grand plans.  Grand plans of balancing being home and going out and about.  Grand plans of squeezing in a bit of time for projects and creativity if able.  Grand plans of meals to make and desserts to enjoy.  We shall see how much I accomplish. It might be a lot, might be hardly anything.  What I can tell you is I am worried about nothing this week and am going to take each new sunrise as a chance to breathe deeply and enjoy this life I'm blessed with."},

If he's having a hard day, he still wants to be a \"roo\" (kangaroo in my pouch). 3 1/2 is definitely not too big to be a roo.You know, I'm happy to be his safe zone. I'm where he feels grounded, centered and happy. Yes, he's quite heavy now, but it doesn't bother me.  I like having him there. If he's having a rough day, popping him on my back for a half hour changes things immensely. Even if he's not in his \"roo pouch\", he's just about always in the same room as me. He hardly lets me out of his sight and he still sometimes cries when I go to work.Just the other day, something big happened.  It might not seem big to everyone else, but it was big to us.Adrian announced, \"Mama, I'm going to go take a walk.\" I just so happened to have my camera handy.I could tell by his face that he meant by himself. Which doesn't happen....going on adventures without his mama.I replied \"Okay, have fun!\"He stood there for a second, not really knowing what to do. But then he turned, and took off. Taking big strides.As he kept going, every few steps, he'd turn around and wave at me. I'd smile and wave back.He must have gotten his confidence up, as he turned around to go the other way. And he walked, walked and walked, out of my sight.  Which has never happened before.  He just kept going.And finally appeared at the other side of the barn.  Happy, yet very serious.  \"Mama, I got some exercise. I it was good exercise. I went on a walk by myself and fell once, but got up by myself and kept getting some more exercise. It was a nice walk, mama.\"Oh goodness, how he radiated with pride! He couldn't wait to tell others about his adventure.  I must say, I was beaming with pride. tpp.  He chose to walk out to the wide open by himself.  He couldn't always see me on that adventure, but he kept going with confidence. It makes me think of the other adventures he's bound to have.  His roots will forever will be planted with me, yes. And he knows that.  But watching him just beginning to grow wings, setting out on his own, exploring uncharted territory-well that's just so exciting to watch.  Particularly since he can't wait to get home to tell me about it.Grow wings, little one. It's okay. Really it is.  Just always come back to where you're rooted.  I'll want to hear all about it."},

Nothing rocket science ranked, but enough changes so that the grown ups are doing all the kitchen work.  These kids really do pull their weight in the kitchen...often without reminders too!  Thankful for that.We took a five week class. At this class, they had miniature placemats and child sized napkins for snack.  My kids loved them, and they contained dinner mess beautifully as an added bonus.  And a table set with fancy placemats?  Why not? I always do enjoy dining in style anyway.  Since his current fave book is Big Red Barn and hers is Barncat (at the red barn door), a red barn it was. They loved them.And I cleared out a drawer so they can have easy access to their special table linens when setting the table.Breakfast in style.Mmm.And just for fun, here's my miniature pitcher set, perfect for little hands pouring their own milk.  (Many given to us by friends...thank you!  Others bought for a dollar or less at thrift stores).Bon appetit!"},

(Okay, not happening, since I'm the only one shouting this from the rooftops!)- Improving the soil in the garden- Improving our sugaring experience.-Improving the watering situation-Using all these elderberries. - Possibly purchasing some sort of tractor to help us with moving, snow removal and rototilling.  We have been looking. My kid told the Kubota guy that he doesn't like Kubota, he just likes John Deere. (Sigh.)-Possibly adding either a milking goat or bees. Bigger pastures.-Fix the barn door, fence pasture for the goats, make chicken run so they can be outside more.-I'm in the planning phases of our \"Farm Time Story Hour.\"  Once it's nice, I'm planning on offering a drop in family story time. Perhaps once? Perhaps monthly or weekly if folks like it?  Just getting the groove and knowing I'll decide what's right for us/others when the time comes.  The plan is Farm books, farm songs, farm trivia and then watching the train go by followed by a projects and/or animal time and/or picnic time.  I'm hoping to put a donation jar out, so folks can contribute to our animal fund.  Hopefully this would be enough so that I'm not making and selling bread nearly as much as last year.  (Our goal is for the farm to support the farm.  Our salaries do not go towards animals, our kids are expected to help us earn money to keep them.  They are great helpers and are proud to count their dollars to buy food.).  -Cont. the tradition started last year of having an annual party to fund raise/ have a toy drive for the Bags of Love ministry. -Expand the orchard. Add a vineyard. -Get the barn fixed up for a play zone. -Fixing things so our pipes no longer freeze.-She wants a barn cat.Long term (in the next 5 or so years):-Get the washer/dryer out of our kitchen.  -Update the bedroom and add a full bath attached to that room.  - Possible broiler chickens.-My son wants a team of oxen.Longer term (one can dream, right?!):-More regular times for others to explore the outdoors here.-Setting up a bed and breakfast?-Solar panels?-Digging a pond (that's my husband's idea).-They both want horses.  And a giraffe.  Mostly, we'll just keep on keeping on.  Loving and living our dream.  And I hope you'll stick around through the years.

And I didn't want to make pasta after they go to bed.  What's the point in making it if you can't enjoy it ASAP?  I really wanted to try it. I just hadn't made it a priority.A good friend was talking about making pasta at our \"Never Need to Read the Book Bookclub\".  She knows me well, as evidenced by: \"Jackie, I can't believe you haven't done it.

That and shoveling snow has been time consuming.I had meant to make some more rice bags.  The cow rice bag pattern I published was a hit.  I had wanted to design and make patterns for more animals.But I've been running out of time, doing that which I mentioned above.  But we use rice bags regularly around these parts.  I wanted more.As I was tidying our puppet bin (that was sprawled across multiple rooms-those kids!), I came across these wash cloth puppets that I got in the target dollar bin maybe 10 years ago?   I'm likely not exaggerating 10 years ago. Here's a pic of me at work with the duck from 7 1/2 years ago.  They have no metal (which is of course important if you're microwaving).  I stuffed them with rice, sewed the bottom.  Voila.  Instant rice bags.Heat in the microwave for 3-4 minutes, place in your bed and it's toasty warm.Useful for Maine winters, for sure.Before-puppets propped on canning jars.After: Useful rice bags.I was going to get a picture of my kids sleeping with their fave puppet rice bags.

", "date": null, "text": "I'm a wee bit excited to show you this project.  I will definitely not tell you how many hours I put into this project, as you never will want to sign up to do your own. But I did it!!!  I re-upholstered not a tiny project, but a big project!  I've done some upholstery before.  A seat on a rocking chair, a set of four dining chairs and two other random chairs. But never a full out major project like this. So, the story behind it.  It was my neighbor's chair. They were cleaning out their old barn and it was slated for the dump.  I have zero need for another project, particularly one of this magnitude, but somehow, I hear my voice pipe \"Don't throw that away! I'll take it!\"  Before I could slap myself silly, I found it in my garage. Although he kept quiet, I'm sure my husband would have had plenty to say about that chair being plopped in our garage. This, apparently, wasn't the first time this chair was destined for the dump.  A decade or two ago, someone would take it as trash for free if it was broken down.  A few sift wallops from a hammer indicated this chair was too solid for an easy breakdown. And so it sat in their big old barn, gathering dust.Who did it belong to?  My neighbor (who is a grandfather himself), his grandmother.  She sat in it by the hour, so I've been told. Rocked and rocked.So back to my garage.. It's sat there for a few months. Finally, I said to myself, \"Self. Listen up. If you don't do this in the long winter months, it will sit for another year.\"That's when my husband found himself doing this:  And here you have the \"before\" pic. During.  The frame is really as solid as can be. The springs are in excellent shape.  A great piece. Drumroll please....the after! It fits in with our regular living room set pretty well, I'd say. (photobombed!)I spent a whopping $15 on this rocker chair.  Painter's canvas and some upholstery tacks. It's already a fave spot. For all. I've found the two of them curled up in it a number of times.So there you have it, a very, very time intensive project. You know what?  I'd do it again. I'm pleased with the results and I really did enjoy working on it.  Do tell me...have you upholstered anything before?"},

{"title": "Homesteading Where You Are:  Save", "date": null, "text": "Week five in the series: Week one: Intro Week two: Make Week three:  GrowWeek four: PreserveThis week is \"Save\".There's no real rules around this series. Just a one word prompt that we each reflect on. Where I go first with the word \"Save\" is money.  I could talk to you all day long about saving money and debt free living. I already bombard you with my thrifted deals all the time.  We walked the walk before we had kids-paying cash, cutting costs, making our own, dumping debt.  We followed Dave Ramsey's plan and met our goal and became debt free (except the mortgage) before we had kids. (Random tidbit: We were even on Dave Ramsey's show on the Fox Business network to tell our story!).  Saving money, although grand, isn't what I'm thinking about today.\"Save\" also makes me think of saving seeds and such. I have a whole box saved for next year.  But saving seeds isn't want I'm thinking about today either.When I think of the word \"Save\", I think of that which is most important to me.  Time. That's right, Time. I want to save more time.  Life is busy, surely, but I work at saving time for that which is most important to me.   What is most important to me?  What are the things I do focus on carving out time for every week?God and my church.My husband and children and family. Good, healthy, homegrown and homemade food for my loved ones.Exercise for me. (I currently squeeze in ~3 days, would love to save some more time for more).This blog and connecting with my readers. (Would like to save more time for responding to my readers.)Time to create.Time to read. (Although it tends to be more magazines lately, but I hope to save more time for books.)Notice on this list, I don't have errands listed.  No grocery shopping, post office, bank and the like.  Because those are things that I try to NOT carve out time for every week.  In fact, those are the types of things I try to skip as much as possible. (No judging if errands are the types of things you enjoy, though! Everyone's list will be different-there will likely be things you enjoy and things that you don't as much.)Why are errands not my thing? Because these are the types of things that take away from that which I really want to be doing. Think of this.  Say you grocery shop weekly.  Say it takes about an hour to write a list, go to the store, shop, come home and put the groceries away.  If that takes you an hour every week, you spend 52 hours a year just going to the grocery store. But, if you can go every other week, eating fresh the first week, frozen the second, you'd go to the store 26 hours a year.  This gives you an extra 26 hours that you can spend doing that which you like!  That's a pretty good chunk of time.I think like this for all my errands.  Do I really NEED to go?  Is it something that HAS to be done straight away?  Can it be done electronically or remotely? I find that I run errands so much less than before now that I'm mindful of how I want my time to be spent.  I don't want to waste hours of my year doing needless things when I could be saving those hours for that which is on my list above.  Saving those hours for that which is important to me.What else do I do to \"save\" time for that list?  Going to grocery store every 2 1/2-3 weeks.  Pharmacy/toiletry type runs only a few times a year. Not scheduling my family/kids with too many activities/social events. Making double batches and freezing. Stocking up on staples. Create something from nothing by looking through the pantry. Elicit my family to help do the chores that need to be done. Sometimes, even ignoring the to do list all together.Point is- time goes quickly.  Make a list of that which really matters.  Can you save some time for that list every week?  If not, can you shorten your errand list to make time for your personal loves? Or what else can you do?Although I work hard at saving time for that which I love, I know I could always do better.  Without doubt though, I am thankful for each minute I save to spend with them. Because this is what I want to save my time for. This is what matters to me.And do check out these other fantastic Homesteaders.  They will surely have lots to tell you.Daisy, at MapleHill101, currently homesteads with her family in the suburbs of Central Florida.  Her vision is to move to a more rural property in North Carolina later this year and continue fostering a self-sufficient lifestyle, which includes chickens, a large garden and a permanent clothesline.  Mary, at Homegrown on the Hill, lives in Southwestern Ohio with her family on a 5 acre homestead.

{"title": "Finding the perfect buttons.", "date": null, "text": "I've had a couple projects as of late that have needed buttons.  I have multiple jars of miscellaneous buttons and finding buttons used to be an activity I enjoyed.  But now, the time when both kids are sleeping is very fleeting. Spending an hour sifting through hundreds of buttons didn't seem like the best use of time given there's laundry, dishes and the like needing attention too. Night after night went by and I just hadn't gotten those buttons out.  The other day I had an epiphany.  Why was I wanting for them to sleep to check it off my list?  Wouldn't they enjoy it too?  I've let them play with my buttons before. Why did I forget that?Sometimes I get so focused sometimes on the end goal that I forget how marvelous the process is for new learners.  Of course they'd enjoy organizing buttons!  And likely they'd enjoy other items on my to do list.  Sure, I try to involve them in as much as possible, but sometimes it's so tempting to get things done quickly while they sleep.  It takes half the time, as you can imagine, doing things alone.  But, you know what's magical?  It was a task I needed to check off my list.  But when I slow myself down and do such a task with the kids, I end up enjoying the process as well as the result.   End result?  I narrowed my selection.  And did so with a smile, in good company.  A win all around.  My pal, Jennifer, over at The Deliberate Mom, just wrote a list of \"Real Learning Activities\" for toddlers (Check out her list here.).  Real learning really is the best type of learning, let us not forget."},

Okay no 'sort of' about it at all.  I'm through with mice. They need to stay our of our house/barn...thankyouverymuch.  I may have sang a little \"Another one bites the dust...\" when I found the last one and was busting a couple moves when my sweet Adrian looked up at me and said, \"Why do we want mice to die, mama?\"    Nothing like a 3 year old to snap me out of celebration mode.  I don't really want them to die.  I just want them to communicate amongst their community about safe and not safe zones and abide by the rules I set.  Stay out of my house, barn and garage are the only simple rules I have.  And since they have not been successful at getting the message across, I need to take charge when they cross the line into our living zones. Okay, I'm not winning any argument here.  Mama fail.And so I create this little playset.  Now one mouse is allowed in our house and it is this one.  If you can get past their obnoxiousness, they really are a little bit cute, I guess.This one is perfect for us, because we can read him little books, tuck him in bed, snap the lid shut and there he sleeps until we're ready to play again.  Nothing is damaged in the process.And so I introduce to you:  The only acceptable mouse in our house:  He's got a house, quilt, pillow and two books.  The box is a jewelry box.  The books are scraps of leather from an old leather coat.The tail is a hair elastic that broke.   Snap him shut and he sleeps all night.  Perfect type of mouse to have. She loves him best.And she reads them little books. So cute.  And so there you have it.  A mouse and his little house.

I'm aiming to make a dress a month for the next 12 months for my 18 month old girl.  I do love a gorgeous little dress, especially a mama made one, on my little girl.  So, that's the plan.The last Monday of the month is when I'm supposed to post.  It's February, I know, but I can't just jump to February without giving January a dress.  (Type A much?!).  I'll still hope to have one for February.  This one counts for January.It's the Oliver & S Tea Party dress.  Much of the dress is upcycled from corduroy scraps/skirts.Vintage buttons.  I made it long enough that it will hopefully last a bit.And the first try, those teeth were bothering her and she was furious I put her down. I still think she looks cute, even though she's mad. That's all it too, a scoop up from mama and she was happy. We were out and about later in the day, so I tried again.  Here's the back. And the front. One dress down. 11 to go.  Challenge on!(And please, join us!  Won't you sew along with us? And share what you've completed!)"},

{"title": "Thrifted. Randoms. Updates.", "date": null, "text": "1) Thrifted and Randoms Pics.  First I want to say how delightful I find it that so many of you appreciate all the junk I find when thrifting.  It's fun for me to spot these deals and it's double the fun to share it with people who find these scores equally as exciting.  Here's another round.Brand new pack of erasers. Binoculars. Spot book and a Barefoot books book.  A brand new number puzzle (that I will be giving away), a magnadoodle that is the perfect size for Handwriting without tears.  A vintage number/peg game.  A box of sponges for painting. $5.50.And...a pair of skates, a Thomas the train puzzle, three straw hats, stencils, four miniature baskets, a tiny metal pitcher, a vintage dish, stencils and the suit coat shown in the next picture: $7.50. Goodness, we have fun with those hats. And just so you can see how long my hair was before I cut it... Those miniature baskets are perfect for feeding horses. 2) Updates.I've still been working at trying new things with the starter.  Here's a sour dough pizza crust. It's almost February.  February means time to prune these fruit trees.  It's sort of the start of the gardening season in a way.I have one chicken moulting right now.  She's bare.  Poor planning on her part. It's cold out there.Although insulating the kitchen floor hasn't helped our frozen pipe issue (they have frozen 12 times thus far), it's much warmer to walk in there.  And the dog water on the floor doesn't freeze. My oldest had a little bread that was store bought.  \"Mama, what is this?  It's not good at all. I only like your bread.\"  Either I created a monster or I should celebrate he appreciates mama made. I could use a month of staying home just to finish all these crafty projects I have in my head.  My friend let me borrow a couple Ottobre and a stack of paper Oliver & S patterns.  I want to dive in. I'm not the most patient person out there.I'm joining my friend Sue from Little Acre that Could in her recent challenge to herself. She's going to make 12 skirts, one a month, for herself this year.  Read about her pledge here. I am jumping on board with her and my goal is making a dress for sweet girl every month.In case you haven't noticed, 9/10 times, she's wearing a dress.  For no other reason other than I like to dress her up. She won't want to be my live doll forever, so I want to dress her in cute little mama made dresses for as long as possible.  So this year, I'm going to focus on playing dress up.How about you? Do you have a crafty project that you are working on? Or you want to work on?  If you do, finish it before the last Monday of the month and Email me a pic. I'll include it in my post.  So look for the next dress the last Monday of the month, every month. (Although I likely will post January's next week. Just about finished and need to take a pic.)Because creating is where the fun's at.  Won't you join?"},

{"title": "Homesteading Where You Are:  Grow", "date": null, "text": "Week three in the series.Week one: Intro Week two: Make This week: Grow. (Some of this I had written a couple months back, so if you're a reader, you might have read some bits and pieces...but there will be more that you haven't read too.) Grow.  Some look at that word and think or say \"I can't\".  You've heard someone talk about their brown thumb, how everything dies, how they just weren't born a gardener. I look at that word and think the opposite. I say \"I can grow that!\"  and \"You can totally grow that!\"Now, my 'can do' attitude about growing things hasn't always panned out to be successful.  Every year, I have huge aspirations and no matter what I do, something I am trying to grow just doesn't..well...grow.  Even the experienced gardener has great years and not so great years.  That's the thing about gardening.  Sometimes it's bountiful, sometimes not so much.  The unfortunate part is that so many focus on their gardening failures and give up. Well, here I am to tell you that even if you haven't had success in the past, you CAN have success going forward.  Sure, not everything in my garden grew this year, but the majority did.  And we've been enjoying the harvest all summer long. Switching gears, I'll give you the background on how I became a gardener.I was raised on a 50 acre hobby farm. My parents planted a garden every year.  I can still see the rectangular plot all plowed and waiting for tiny seeds.  I see the large patch of rhubarb on the end.  I picture the vegetables we always planted thriving.  Corn, onions, peppers, peas, green and yellow beans, carrots, beets (NOT my fave), zucchini, summer squash, cucumbers, brussel sprouts, broccoli, potatoes, squash, pumpkins. I must be forgetting some. The part of the garden closest to the house was always relatively weed free, with the jungle of weeds at the end of the garden closest to the chickens. I entered some of our produce in the county fair, earning numerous blue ribbons.  Summer living included fresh produce, home picked. That's just how it was.I did have a gardening hiatus come college.  I did try once in an apartment building, but our patio wasn't lucky enough to receive any southern sun exposure.  Not much happened. When we bought our first house, my one requirement was enough land to have a garden.  We did buy that, but I underestimated how many trees needed to be removed for enough light our woody plot.  I did put some tomatoes in five gallon buckets and tried to enlist my husband to follow this tomato bucket moving schedule to \"catch\" the sun as best possible.  Yeah, so, he didn't play that game long.  Although I couldn't vegetable garden, I really dove into perennials.  It's amazing what you can grow in part shade to full shade!  I think I counted 60+ varieties I planted/maintained in a lot that really didn't have anything other than weeds before I started.  Although I couldn't grow vegetables, it was those years early in my marriage that I concentrated on perennials.  I see now how awesome it was that I couldn't grow veggies, as it was my opportunity to learn about perennials.My dear neighbors, who had become like-family knew how much I wanted to garden.  They offered up their farm, walking distance from our home.  I was over the moon excited.  The neighborhood team of horses plowed the land and I got started.  Years after proved to be quite interesting, especially given I'm the one who does planting in our household.  I planted very pregnant one year, harvested full term and preserved as a first time mom with a newborn.  Then I planted a large garden with a not quite one year old who was entirely too helpful.  Then I planted with a not quite two year old ready to pop.  And then preserved with my two helpers.  Given our garden wasn't such that I could tend it when my children were sleeping, it was quite the adventure.Fast forward to 2013, It was our first summer living in the home of my dreams.  For the first time in a long time, I could walk out my door and be harvesting dinner. We had a garden where the original owners tended a garden for 100+ years.  It's a spot that fed a family of 7. Although a recent septic project led to sandy soil being deposited right on top of the beautiful soil (pft), it still produced a lot. A lot in that every single day from June 2013 until Jan 2014, we have consumed good from our garden.   I'll give you the run down of what I grew last year. Find more detailed previous gardening 2013 posts through linking here.  I'm also reviewing what I hope to add. Fruits:Started 5 apple trees, 67 raspberry bushes, 4 blueberry bushes and lots of strawberries.  I found a half a dozen elderberries mature plants that I wasn't able to get to because of wild raspberry brush. A path is now cleared to them. I hope to use those elderberries this year. I found 4 apple trees on the property that I hope to prune and fertilize next month. Hoping to bring them back to better productions. And hoping the apples aren't yucky!  I also found some concord grapes and some green grapes.  I would like to better organize how they grow so I can get better yield.  I saved a few peach pits from my friends' tree.  I hope to start those.  I am thinking of adding golden delicious apple trees (best for pollination, I learned) and maybe pear and cherry trees.  Herbs: Basil, parsley, oregano, cilantro, chives.  Right now, I have mint, lemon mint, rosemary and thyme that I'm growing and will transplant outside.  I also want to grow some dill for pickles.Veggies:Tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, broccoli, onions, garlic, kale, swisschard, different types of lettuce, cucumbers, zucchini, summer squash, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, cabbage, green and yellow beans, peas, corn, butternut squash, acorn squash, spaghetti squash, sugar pumpkins. I'm going to add hot peppers and different potato varieties.  I also found 2 rows of asparagus that I want to bring back to life.    I may be forgetting some, but all in all, it's a lot, but it gives us a great variety, year round. Most all was from seeds, not bought as seedlings.  I also started some cosmos, sunflowers, marigolds and morning glories. And more perennials than I can count.  I gathered and dried around 20 packets of seeds from the plants what I grew last year. Often, I hear that it's best to start fresh with new seeds rather than saving your own.  I would like to do a little experiment and plant mine adjacent to newly purchased seeds this year, just to see if there would be a difference. All in all, I'm thankful for not only the bounty we harvest, but also the days spent enjoying the work in the garden-solo and with the family, the knowledge my kids have gained, the variety of foods my kids eat, the fact my husband appreciates all the work I do to make sure we all eat healthy (he's not into gardening, but he's a great cheerleader!).   I'm eager for the 2014 growing season to commence. I think improving our soil will have massive returns.   Have you planned your garden?  Are you thinking of giving gardening a shot?  What are your 2014 plans? I do love to talk about growing things. And do check out these other fantastic Homesteaders.  They will surely have lots to tell you about growing things too.Daisy, at MapleHill101, currently homesteads with her family in the suburbs of Central Florida.  Her vision is to move to a more rural property in North Carolina later this year and continue fostering a self-sufficient lifestyle, which includes chickens, a large garden and a permanent clothesline.  Mary, at Homegrown on the Hill, lives in Southwestern Ohio with her family on a 5 acre homestead. Their goal is to be as much self sufficient as possible. In helping with this goal, they raise a big garden and keep chickens, rabbits, and cattle for food.Staci, at Life At Cobble Hill Farm, was bitten by the homestead bug in 2006 and although she began her homesteading ventures in a rented condo, is now homesteading on less than an acre in Upstate NY. Sue– at The Little Acre that Could, shares her body with an auto-immune disease, and life with her husband. They live in aonce-working Victorian farm cottage now bordered by a modern subdivision. She has dreamed of homesteading as long as she canremember and continues to strive toward that goal in rural Atlantic Canada."},

It's not good enough to share, but I am anyway, because my kids loved it.  Kids are forgiving, not even criticizing the total non-artist that created them.  All I did was color, cut, glue onto thicker paper and cut/hotglue old magnets on the back.  Done.Find the free patterns/printables here.  And they love the set, they really do. I hope you'll make a set too!"},
{"title": "Outside. ", "date": null, "text": "Yes, we live in Maine.  Maine is code for \"long, cold winter\".  Cold as in really cold. As in negative temperatures cold. That lasts forever and causes our pipes to freeze a dozen times so far (grr). But, you know what?  As long as you have the right gear, cold isn't really that bad. We know.  Because we're outside daily, regardless of the weather.  Winter is too beautiful to enjoy from inside.  Getting out in it, smelling the fresh air, hearing the stillness matched with the crunch of the snow beneath your feet just opens your mind to open-ended thoughts.  How I love to let my mind travel. And all that exercise totally earns you an extra dessert.  As I mentioned, we're out in it daily. In our boots, on snowshoes on sleds, sometimes skis or skates. Sometimes snowpants and sometimes impromptu play that we never even properly dressed for.  Something fun, yes, but nothing with any motor other than what our own two feet can power us to do.  I hardly take the camera, as there's no suitable place to set it when I want to be having fun. So I most often choose fun over the camera.  But, I decided to bring you along on just one of our adventures. This was just before I cut my hair, but we've been several times since.  Perhaps, just maybe, those anti-snow pals of mine may see the beauty of winter the way I see it.No matter how cold, bitter and annoying winter gets, a little bit of winter is quite good, if nothing else but for beautiful pictures."},

{"title": "Homesteading Where You Are:  Make", "date": null, "text": "Week 2 in the seven part series is today.If you missed last week, check here for the introduction.This week's prompt is \"Make\".  Oh, I love that word. \"Make\".  If you're a regular reader around these parts, you know \"making\" is what I do.  Food, lots of food. Desserts, lots of desserts.  (AND lots more food stuff....I'll get into that next week!) But also clothes hats, diapers, outerwear, toys, stuffed animals,  games, home furnishing , patterns (click here), quilts. Goodness, that's just the start.  Look at the tabs above to see more of that which I have created.  Making is what I do.Now, let me take this chance to knock out a couple misconceptions/questions I seem to get regularly.1) \"Wow, you're so talented.\" I am not.  I always fire back that I'm without doubt not more talented than others.   I have been at this creating gig for a number of years, I just keep learning and adding my knowledge.  Most of what I do is self taught and not hard.  Nothing I do is so challenging that you can't do it too.  I always say be brave enough to try and have the patience to complete. That's it. Totally do-able.2) \"Where do you find the time?\"  I always find time for making things because that's what I enjoy.  Yes, life is busy with work, two littles and the critters to care for.  But, I don't watch TV.  Instead, I try to carve out a little chunk of time every week to create. Sometimes it's naptime. Sometimes it's evening. Sometimes it's in the passenger seat of the car as we go someplace.  Sometimes it's with my kids participating.  Sometimes it's 10 minutes. Sometimes an hour.  Rarely more than that at this point in my life.  Even just a few minutes here and there adds up and projects do eventually become completed.3) \"Are you making that for the blog?\"  No.  I do not \"make\" anything for my blog.  I do take pictures of things I do for my blog, but I don't make anything specifically to post.  I live my life and create as I am inspired.  If it's something I want to remember or I think others might enjoy, I do post it.  But if I spent my time thinking of things for my blog, blogging wouldn't be fun any longer.4) \"Don't you get sick of making bread/making yogurt/sewing little quilt squares again and again, sanding, etc?\"  Most of the time, I don't get sick of making things. Even if it's the same thing again and again.  To me, there's nothing like the excitement of an idea, the process of doing, the admiration of what was completed and the enjoyment of using/consuming that what was made.  It's exciting to learn something new and it's comforting and peaceful to work on something familiar. I like each part of the process of making most things, so I don't get tired of making.  If I did, I might take a break from doing it, but I'd soon return.5) What are you working on next?  Oh goodness, I have a list. As always.  I have two more pieces of furniture I want to refinish in the near future, as well as others in the distant future. I want to repaint our guest room. I want to create something spectacular to spice up the look of our new and improved bedroom. I have a chair that needs to be reupholstered. I have a few more toy ideas for my kids.  He wants his own apron.  I want to make her more dresses.  If she ever gets hair, I want to make bows. I'm working on making our barn into a kid friendly play zone (slowly).  I want to make cold frames out of old windows.  I want to create something with my pictures to give the hallway a pop.  I want to make some more cinnamon raisin bread (hey, I never posted that, did I?!).  I want to get over the fear of dunking bagels in water before baking them (it gives me the heebie geebies!).  I want to make soap with the milking goat we hope to get. I want to make a programmed conveyor belt that delivers laundry to drawers so I don't have to lift a finger.  Hey, a girl can dream, right?  No shortage of making on my end.Let me hear from you now, what are you making? And what are you hoping to give a whirl?And my dad makes lots and lots of great stuff too.  I'll be posting more of his creations tomorrow.  Don't miss it! :)And do check out these other fantastic Homesteaders.  They will surely have lots to tell you.Daisy, at MapleHill101, currently homesteads with her family in the suburbs of Central Florida.  Her vision is to move to a more rural property in North Carolina later this year and continue fostering a self-sufficient lifestyle, which includes chickens, a large garden and a permanent clothesline.  Mary, at Homegrown on the Hill, lives in Southwestern Ohio with her family on a 5 acre homestead.

So squishy and snuggly and warm. I love her little baby already, and I haven't even met him yet.  And what I must do for those I love is create.  And that's what I have been doing a lot of.  The theme I was going for: \"My love for you is BIGGER than an ELEPHANT.\" First up, I made this elephant. The pattern is from Soft Animals A to Z by Carolyn Vosburg Hall.  I bought it for a dollar some time ago at a thrift shop (naturally), and just dove in. He has a sweet matching tail, that I failed to capture.  He's made of fleece and is oh-so-soft. I love him.I made a fabric basket (basket pattern here, if you want the elephant templates, ask and I can post).  And I busted out my watercolors for a card.  Haven't done that in forever.And then I made a cozy little pillow (I have the elephant templates if you want them, just ask!) I added matching fabric to the top and painted elephants on a magazine rack/book holder. And added this great book \"Meet me at the moon\", about Mamas always coming back.  And then bought this little rug that ties it all together.  I usually don't photograph something like this to share, but I did take a picture of the finished gift.  It really was a special couple of weeks, spending hours upon hours creating, while simultaneously thinking about that sweet boy.   I do love giving homemade gifts.  I hope that sweet baby will love his cozy little nook, created by someone afar who loves him already."},

If you're new here, meet the four of us.  Justin, Jackie, Adrian, Audra and dog Kammie. Jackie is the blogger.   The word \"homesteading\" was a somewhat unfamiliar word to me some time ago.  I always thought of it as a \"Little House on the Prairie\" type of term.  You know, something back in the olden days, building a house and property out of nothing, because that's what they had to do.  Someone said something to me about my 'homesteading' journey.  I thought, \"Oh no, I'm not a homesteader.  We have electricity and I use the computer.  We have running water and I drive a car.\"  But then, a second person called me a homesteader.  I looked up the definition of 'homesteading' on the great researching source-Wikipedia.It said:\"Broadly defined, homesteading is a lifestyle of self-sufficiency. It is characterized by subsistence agriculture, home preservation of foodstuffs, and it may or may not also involve the small scale production of textiles, clothing, and craftwork for household use or sale.\"Goodness, that is me.  I never had the goal of being termed a homesteader, I was just trying to about my business living the homemade-home grown-from-scratch life.  Why? Because I only get one shot at this life and I want to do the best I can.  Because I enjoy it.  Because I think that's what's best for my family.  Because it keeps us home and fosters together time.  Because I like learning new things.  Because I am cheap.  Because seeing the smile on their faces and a genuine 'thank you' makes my heart sing.  Because I want to give everything I can to those I love.I guess I am a homesteader. Without realizing it.  And I bet you are too...given you're reading this.  Getting back to our roots, simplifying, getting dirty, learning new things, exploring, unplugging, and/or living life outside.  You're likely doing some of that too. Whether you live with your parents, in an apartment, in the city, suburbs or country, you are a homesteader. Whether you are thinking about learning to cook your own dinners, grow a garden or raise cattle, you are a hoemsteader. And the great thing about being a homesteader is it's a club.  A non exclusive club.  A whole variety of people who have walked the walk and are talking the talk.  And you're invited to join, because this homesteading adventure is too good to go at alone.There's a few of us who will be talking about our homesteading journey every Wednesday for 7 weeks, links at the bottom.  Inspiring women, all of them!Here's my journey.I grew up on a 50 acre hobby farm.  My parents worked to grow/raise and preserve quite a bit.  We had a large garden and my mom did a lot of freezing.  My dad raised beef cows, sheep, pigs and chickens for food.  He also hunted and had bees.  I was an avid 4-Her, diving into all sorts of 'back to basics' projects (sewing/quilting being my biggest love) and I had a few rabbits that I tended.After I graduated graduate school, I was living in an apartment.  I made it my goal to always have a project I was working on learning something new.  Sewing, crafting, cooking, baking, etc.  I was forever setting goals and working towards completing them. Might take a few days, month or a year, but I was always trying to learn how to do things myself. I've kept that going...always having something new to learn.We moved to a fantastic little cape in Maine. I spent a lot of time in the kitchen and my crafting studio, but I was unable to grow anything but shade loving perennials. While we loved our last place, it didn't have enough acreage to support much livestock, nor did it have enough light to support vegetable gardening. My generous neighbors let me garden at their farm.  I wrote about that here. One year ago, we signed papers and this is the marvelous place became our forever home. We're in a coastal town in Southern Maine.  Just a few miles from the beaches, but far enough away to enjoy the peace of country living at its finest. I recently gave quite the tour of our place and the progress we have made. Plus our entourage of animals.  Find that post here.  Now we have the opportunity to have our own, large garden. I'll talk about that garden in weeks to come.  I try to make, grow, raise as much as possible of what we eat.  I'm getting more successful each year.And of course, I have little helpers along the way.What else do I do?  Well, I like photography and I am quite the paparazzi when it comes to my kids.  I do a lot of sewing and dabble in woodworking.  I do some pattern creating, check out the tabs at the top to see my creations. I work part time as a speech language pathologist doing outpatient rehab for a local hospital.  Without doubt, my biggest passion is my children.  I homestead because of them and for them. I'm appreciate all of you who have come along for the ride thus far, and I'm thankful you keep checking in on us.  For those who are stopping by for the first time, I invite you to stay.  We do have a lot of fun, and we're happy to have you join us. And tell me...your turn readers...what makes YOU a homesteader? What do you on your own? I'm sure it's something.  Do tell.  Also, remember, I'm not the only homesteader out there.  Join these other fantastic women on their journeys.  Find us all every Wednesday...and of course many days in between.  It will take us a seven weeks to detail that which we do, so do stick around. Daisy, at MapleHill101, currently homesteads with her family in the suburbs of Central Florida.  Her vision is to move to a more rural property in North Carolina later this year and continue fostering a self-sufficient lifestyle, which includes chickens, a large garden and a permanent clothesline.  Mary, at Homegrown on the Hill, lives in Southwestern Ohio with her family on a 5 acre homestead. Their goal is to be as much self sufficient as possible. In helping with this goal, they raise a big garden and keep chickens, rabbits, and cattle for food.Staci, at Life At Cobble Hill Farm, was bitten by the homestead bug in 2006 and although she began her homesteading ventures in a rented condo, is now homesteading on less than an acre in Upstate NY. Sue– at The Little Acre that Could, shares her body with an auto-immune disease, and life with her husband. They live in aonce-working Victorian farm cottage now bordered by a modern subdivision. She has dreamed of homesteading as long as she canremember and continues to strive toward that goal in rural Atlantic Canada."},

And then, of course, petting, hugging and feeding treats to those beautiful draft horses.  Thank you, friends.  - My husband was a rockstar on my birthday...made a gorgeous cake and dinner.- My kids have been getting along better than they ever have.  I usually need to constantly supervise the little one, but she has been staying right with her big brother.  I've been able to do some tasks that their 'helpfulness' is too helpful, like move things around in the barn, with them playing together on their own. -The BOG spoiled them with some more homemade toys.  I can't wait to show you.- There is no homemade dessert in this house.  That problem will be rectified tomorrow.3) I've given myself a little challenge.

{"title": "Stepping Stumps. And thrifted Tonka love.", "date": null, "text": "It was just about dark yesterday when we realized our amazing stepping stumps were no longer under a blanket of snow.  How marvelous it was to re-discover them!  And in case you're wondering what I'm talking about, it's because I never told you about them.  Oops.  They came before Thanksgiving and I, apparently, talked about lots of other things and glossed right over the marvelous stepping stumps.  Better late than never, right? Stepping stumps. That's just what they are.I know, without doubt that the BOG (Bald Old Grandpa if you're a new reader) thought I was nuts when I requested them. He had the chainsaw out, helping cut firewood.  We were all cold, but I insisted he make different sized stepping stumps.  He didn't agree right away, but I think he finally agreed to get me to keep my mouth shut.  They are just different sized stumps...simple toys that can be moved around as needed.But to them, they are so much more.The bridge to get over the water.  Boats to stay afloat.  Different farms to visit. Stairs to climb.  Buildings to jump off of.  Endless possibilities. I know he thought I was crazy. But they are some of the best outdoor toys ever. While going through pictures, I found a few more that I never shared and randomly decided I would. Tonka love.My father in law saved my husband's Tonka dump truck.  It has been used so much.  Metal toys hold up so much better than plastic. Only problem?  Two kids, one Tonka truck.  I spotted one at an antique store for $8.00.  That's less than buying a new plastic one that won't last more than a couple years.  Resale for those right now are $60 and up.  But, of course, we won't be selling ours.There's far too many important jobs to complete. Well, there you have it.  Two marvelous toys we added to our outdoor play recently.  Inspired by a bit of thawing in warmer temperatures in Maine.  For that, we are thankful."},

{"title": "All I ever wanted.", "date": null, "text": "25 years ago or so, if you would have asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I'd say a mama. I'd say I'd want to marry a good boy. I'd say I wanted to go to school first and be married a few years before I had kids.  I'd say I wouldn't want to work too much so I could enjoy my kids.  I'd say I would want to raise my kids in the Pray Road farmhouse I grew up in.  I'd probably say I wanted a sewing machine and a few animals.I distinctly remember blowing out candles, closing my eyes to make a wish, and wishing I'd have a family someday.  Goodness, I must have been 9 or 10.  Those wishes...sometimes they do come true.  And sometimes not just one wish, but sometimes a whole bunch of wishes really do come true.  I'm living my fantasy almost exactly.Only I'm not in the Pray Road farmhouse. I live in the home of my dreams-an even more amazing house in a coastal town in Maine.Even during these cold winter months when the days are short and our time spent outside is brief, there's so much light and sunshine in my heart.  Dreams really do come true.  Today in particular, I'm so incredibly thankful for another year living my fantasy.  And cake. I'm thankful for cake too (hint hint, dear husband of mine.)  And we can just gloss over how high that number called 'age' really is now.  Yikes.  Back to the thankfulness...that's much more fun to think about.

{"title": "Pancakes and Pancake Mix in a Jar (Free printable labels)", "date": null, "text": "How is it possible that I have not shared the recipe we use for pancakes before? Years back, I ditched Bisquick.  Goodness, I love that stuff. I grew up having it.  I could just eat the batter and be happy.  But do you know how much junk is in Bisquick?  Lots of words I don't know.  That's when I ditched it, for good. This is our go to pancake recipe now. I have no idea where it's from....used for a while and it's written on a note card.  It makes light and fluffy pancakes that my family devours. There's two parts of this post.  First is the recipe. Second is about making the mix ahead to keep in your pantry for those days when you need pancakes ASAP.  Those days do happen in our house...needing pancakes. Part One: Recipe Pancakes1 1/2 cup flour (I usually do 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour)3 1/2 tsp baking powder1 tsp salt1T sugar1 1/4 cup milk1 egg3 T butter, melted.Toss all ingredients in mixer. Mix.  Cook on the griddle..and drop a few blueberries in them while they're cooking upMakes enough for a family of four. If you want them fluffier, you can add more flour too.Part two: Mixes in your pantry.It seems somewhat regularly, when we have someplace to be in the morning, someone in my family requests pancakes.  I like to reserve my 'nos' for important things, so I figured I needed to get a better way to go about this pancake thing so I can say 'yes' and make them in a jiffy.  You know what's marvelous? - It takes no time to premeasure and fill a bunch of jars.- A single batch fits in a pint size jar.  A double batch fits in a quart sized jar. -You don't have to find the recipe because it's listed right on the canning lid. - A small batch is perfect for those quick mornings.  A double batch is great when we don't have anywhere to be. I just cook the entire amount and put in the freezer for toaster pancakes.  -It's super quick to make them when it's premeasured.  I dump the contents of the jar in the mixing bowl. I put the butter in the canning jar to melt.  After the butter is dumped in the mixing bowl, I use the canning jar to crack the egg in.  Dump that in the mixing bowl and I can use the canning jar to measure the milk.  Hardly any dishes.It's quicker than pouring cereal, mixing it this way.Just the dry ingredients go in the jars.  The wet ones are done later and are listed on the lid.Single Batch Dry Ingredients: Pint size jar. 1 1/2 cup flour (I usually do 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour)3 1/2 tsp baking powder1 tsp salt1T sugarDouble Batch Dry Ingredients: Quart sized jar.3 cup flour (I usually do 2 cups white flour, 1 cup white whole wheat flour)7 tsp baking powder2 tsp salt2T sugarAnd to get your own fancy printable labels, click here.And now I want pancakes. An a random...best photobomb ever.  Everyone wants to get their pancake on.  Won't you join?"},

Now that we own *only* one house, I decided I can afford the more expensive thrift store.  More expensive, yes...but still very reasonable.Three brand new tin boxes.  Not sure for what, but I had to have them.  A fox hat, a baseball glove and an entire set of vintage Richard Scary books (love!).  $10.Two doll chars.  A bud vase.  A metal pitcher (which I put my kids' drinks in and they pour them into their own cups), a set of 6 kid sized pottery mugs, a cute little bell, four vintage plates. $12.And since I'm on a spending spree...on another trip, I also hit the jackpot for good condition used kids' outdoor/sports equipment.  Ice skates, helmet, soccer cleats, shinguards, another baseball glove and a beach umbrella.  All for $22.00. It's amazing what you can get if you're patient, keep your eyes open and frequent a thrift store ~3x a month.2) And those fox hats.  Love.Yeah, I think they're related.Those books are a hit too.3) Updates* I'm not painting this week. Not at all.* I feel foolish that I complained at the sparse harvest.  Every meal I have made since June has incorporated something we grew.  That feels amazing. * I wish I could wave a magic wand and all the housework would disappear. Because all I really want to do is wear wool, have a warmed rice bag on my lap and be raising and lowering the presser foot on that sewing machine.*The pipes have froze 6x so far this year.  Not fun.  We have had 3 quotes for replacement windows.  Decision time.  I hope it makes a difference. * I had the most glorious snowshoe adventure, by myself, this weekend.  Sun shining bright.  A balmy 19 degrees=no need for hats/gloves. (Thick blood, I tell you.) Snow crunching under my toes.  Dog running along beside me. Sun shining between the trees.  My heart pumping.  There's no better way to recharge.*I scheduled myself too much at work today.  Seeing the kids is the fun part of the job.  The mound of the aftermath paperwork will not be fun.  I CAN do today and do it well.

The second a little one fell asleep, I painted. And now I'm sick of painting.  Same thing happened last time, I painted until I wanted to paint no longer.  A couple months went by and I'm at it again. It might be a few more months before I get another spurt.  But, alas...progress has been made.  I have only taken pictures of the bedroom and headboard/footboard.  I don't even want to look at the other things I painted to take pictures just yet.  I'm that sick of painting.Although I love and appreciate all the wall paper in this house and imagine the story behind it, all this wall paper makes me feel like a guest.  I didn't pick it, it isn't what I would have picked, and while I do appreciate it, it's not 'us'.  Soooo....another room on the list...and a three year old who sobs big sobs that I'm ruining the beautiful flowers on the wall.  Goodness, he's dramatic.This time, our room.  We've been at this room for a while (see here and here).Just as a refresher, here's a before:And here's now.And the headboard and foot board I painted with milk paint and waxed.  Just like they did back in the day, before they had all the fancy paints.  It's so cool, you paint it and it comes off in random places, just because.  This is what 'red' turns out as.   I love it (along with my Merry-Christmas to me Chicken lamps...love those too). Now there's a blank white slate everywhere.  Which gets me excited, as I get to dream, play and perhaps create to decorate these walls. Even though we lived here over a year, now that it's painted, I finally feel like it's mine.  And my husband loves it so much, too.  Really, it's the room we all gravitate towards, which I love. Suggestions from all you readers?  We're blessed with lots of wall space in this room.

Lots to celebrate, for sure.And my letter to Audra Grace.You add such spice to our life.  You are always moving and rarely doing that what you're supposed to do.  You're curious, inquisitive and don't take 'no' for an answer. You keep us on our toes!  And you know what you want and you're not afraid to ask...err...demand your requests. You are the welcome wagon.  In the car, you say \"Hi dada, Hi dada..\" until daddy says 'hi'.  And then you say \"Hi mama, Hi mama...\" until I say 'hi'.  And then you say \"Hi brother, hi brother...\" until he says 'hi'. And then you start the entire process over again. And again. And again. You do the same thing when you talk on the phone.  You also say 'hi' to whatever random stranger you find. Anyone you can greet, you will.  Again and again.Your favorite joke is 'knock knock'.  You come up to whoever will listen and say \"Knock, knock\".  When they say \"Who's there?\", you say \"Audra\" and laugh hysterically.  And then you do it again. And again.Whatever we give you, you always refuse and choose something else. \"No, this.\", you say.  You ask \"Why\" all the time...even with your hand on your hip as you drag the word out to a two syllable phrase. You can say that with quite the punch.  You love accessories-Uncle Matt's racing medals in particular.  Socks, shoes, hats, boots.  You have more style than your mama.  Although you spend the majority of your life moving, talking and getting into trouble, you do like a few toys that you'll occasionally play by yourself.  Horses, in particular. Books.  And art stuff-coloring/painting.  You love your brother.  You follow him around and want to do whatever he is doing.  You also love all the animals and are always gentle with them.  You can do about a dozen different animal sounds on command.  You also are a fan of the word 'udder' and everytime you see a picture of a cow with an udder, you are quick to point that udder out to us.You are great at winking...which is really blinking.  Sometimes you wink at everyone at the table.Your favorite things to eat are chips, eggs (you can eat 4!), homemade applesauce/pearsauce and shepherd's pie.  You're not a fan of going anywhere in the car after it's dark.  During the day, fine, but not after dark.  And you're still not a big fan of sleeping.  Oh well. All in all, you are a firecracker.  You have spunk. You make us laugh.  You still love to snuggle.  We cannot imagine our life without you.  We love oodles and oodles and oodles. This is a dress that I wore as a child.

Cold.The last couple days, I've left the kids inside and done morning chores alone.  This never happens, and they weren't happy about it. I haven't had many toys in the living room, but moved a bunch in.  It's just too cold elsewhere.  I figured we'd all want to be huddled around the fire.  And snow.  We've got some of that and more coming.  In Maine, we measure snow not by inches this year, but by feet of snow.  It's a good time to cozy up and find fun things to do inside.But they wanted to play in the snow.  Who am I to say no?  I figured it would take me longer to bundle them than the time we spent outside in this weather. A lot of effort for nothing, so I thought.   Especially they love to lay in the snow to eat it.  But I did it anyway.And you know what? It took 20 minutes to bundle them up, we were outside for 45 minutes.   And this three year old, let me tell you, cannot do anything without farming.  He HAD to bring a cow with him.  That cow shoveled with him, trudged through the snow, made snow angels and went on numerous sledding rides.  And here's where mama gets in trouble.  We went into the barn and it was his job to feed grain to the goats.  He set the cow in a safe place (unannounced to me), loaded grain in his dumptruck and fed those goats. While he did that, I was raking hay (starting to prep that indoor playyard in the barn I hope to complete).  Apparently that cow was raked into a pile of hay.  It's not a needle in a haystack, there's a miniature cow in the haystack.  And I'm in trouble.Thankfully, he agreed to just try to look again tomorrow.  He won't forget, let me tell you.  This farmer takes care of every one of his animals.

To heading to the Christmas tree.  (FAST!) To finding a note from Santa. To some pleasure reading.To getting into trouble.  To accessorizing with items we have around the house? And then, finally stockings.  Which Santa buys pre packaged food mama never buys.  So that's when everything stopped.  And we spent an hour eating. And we sat in front of the tree, eating.Finally, we dug into the presents.   Then more presents (marvelous and generous ones that I failed to take pictures of them opening) on Skype with their grandparents.  And the tunnel, they love the tunnel.  They call it the worm.  They like to play in the worm. And do farming, naturally. Not counting the presents from his grandparents and the prepackaged snacks, the toy presents to my kids from Santa/us generated this much waste. (Cloth bags on left, paper recyclable on top, plastic waste on bottom).  Keeping things simple, reusable wrapping and thrift shopping=much less to clean up.  Good stuff if you're neurotic like me, and have heart palpitations when thinking of wasting.   Anyway, once we finished opening, I lined up all their loot and made them sit in front of it.  They were cooperative, because, you know, there were more snacks involved.  It was a marvelous day for them, totally tuckered her out. Hope your loved ones brought some joy in your heart too.  Merry Christmas to all!"},
{"title": "Those goats....", "date": null, "text": "Sure, sometimes they drive me absolutely nuts.  They love to either follow me when I don't want them to and get into mischief or to ignore me when I want them to come.  Although never funny to me in the moment, it would be comical for you to watch me trying to get them grain. Both of them jump up on the old freezer we store the grain in, by the time I get them down and open the freezer, one has already jumped in. By the time I get him out, the other one has likely jumped in.  Lifting goats with a kid simultaneously on my back.  It's a form of exercise.  It must be.But seeing the goats around this old farm, hearing them call to us, watching my kids give them ginormous hugs...  They're meant to be here, they really are.  And you know, sometimes they knock on our door.  Seriously, it's a real knock that we think is a human.  And to open the door, expecting company, and then you find a little goat staring at you?  How could you not smile?  Really, they're welcome company around these parts.  Glad we have them."},
{"title": "Christmas Eve", "date": null, "text": "Christmas Eve night arrived before I was even aware.  A too-late dinner paired with a too-late bedtime paired with a sick mama who was doing her best at flying solo=an overwhelmed mama. Once I got them dressed, I was ready to tuck them in bed to begin the monumental task of preparing that Christmas tree for Christmas morning.  But, something stopped me from thinking \"What's next?\" for just a moment.  It was my kids.  Squealing in excitement over their new mama made jammies.  I didn't feel like trucking down those stairs once again to grab the camera, but I'm very glad I did. They were playing \"One Potato, Two Potato, Three Potato, Four\".And talking and laughing about who knows what.And this wasn't my idea, it was his.This year they look so big.  Next Christmas Eve, I'll look back at these pictures and they'll look so tiny.  Grabbing that camera helped me slow down.They *finally* fell asleep.  Somehow, I pulled the strength to get the tree ready. It's no fun being sick on Christmas, let me tell you.  But I managed. And in my eyes, it looked striking. (Can you spy the cat?) I wrapped all ours in fabric bags/wooden boxes.   My in laws sent several generous packages and asked us to wrap them. I used the packing paper that came with their amazon orders and tied a bow.  That look is my favorite type of look for holiday packages. Thankful I pulled it together, despite not feeling well.   I promise to show you Christmas pictures as soon as I have more energy to go through them (hope to feel 100% soon!)  Thankful my kids had a marvelous Christmas."},

{"title": "Gingerbread Men", "date": null, "text": "My little guy has been asking to make Gingerbread Men for some time.  He's a big fan of \"Run, run, as fast as you can, you can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man\" story.  How fitting that Gingerbread Men are a perfect Christmas Cookie as well?  Win-win.We had some of our dearest friends over for an ornament making/gingerbread man making party.  We made the cookies and they left with the baked cookies, some frosting and a few sweet things to decorate them at home. Such a fun time. Win-win-win.The idea for a Gingerbread Family Kit came from a fantastic book- FamilyFun Homemade Holidays.  They suggested a tin with gingerbread men, frosting and a few decorated mini bags of toppings.  The recipe also came from there too.  It was so yummy-soft, and tasty.Confession.  I really don't like cake and cookie decorating.  Don't get me wrong, I love a beautiful cake/cookie...I just don't have the patience for doing so. Or maybe I'd rather just eat what I'm baking rather than drool while decorating?  I even took a cake decorating class a few years back, thinking if I learned that I'd fall in love with cookie decorating.  Nope.  I still am not a fan. My favorite way to have gingerbread men is with a coat of buttercream, which I did for some of these.  But, I also wanted my kids to see how neat royal icing is.  I made some and did a (hopefully) passable job decorating. It must have been good enough, as the cookies are long gone.Gingerbread Men (Adapted from FamilyFun)1/2 cup butter, room temperature1/2 cup packed brown sugar2 eggs3/4 cup molasses1 tablespoon cinnamon2 teaspoons ground gingerPinch nutmeg 1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour1) Combine butter, bwn sugar, eggs and molasses.  Add cinn, ginger, nutmeg, baking soda and 3 cups flour.  Mix in the remaining flower/enough flour to form the dough into a ball that doesn't stick to your hands. 2) On flouered surface, roll to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut cookies with cookie cutters, transferring to greased cookie sheet with a spatula/pastry scraper.3) Bake 350 for 10ish minutes or until the cookie is just set and turning just a tad brown. 4) Cool on .  Frost with your favorite butter cream/royal icing recipe.  Decorate.Enjoy!  They didn't last long. My kids and my cookie monster husband gobbled them up.  Might have to make them again...you know....for Santa."},

I think that quote was just a bit of foreshadowing.I had a whole container of the best looking ones made.  26 of them to be precise.  You see, I was going to take pictures for you and bring them to a Christmas Cookie swap party. I had a few flops I told my husband he could eat, but the rest were for the party.  The next day, I burst into tears when I discovered that he got confused which he could eat and consumed 17 of my best made cookies.  Not only were the ones I was going to photograph gone, but also I didn't have these to bring to my swap party.It's hard to be married to the cookie monster sometimes.  He does love my desserts, but he won't be doing something like that again.   Anyway, although they are a little time consuming, they are good.  It's more like a pastry than a super sweet dessert.  Which means they would be perfect for breakfast (and lunch, dinner and dessert).  There you have it, another dessert that would be tasty all day long.It joins this other series I've been working on, recipes from my fave childhood baker's Christmas spread: Christmas Casserole Cookies Danish Chocolate Orange CookiesBuckeyesMexican Wedding Cakes  It's originally called \"Fudge Filled Turnovers\" and it's from Good Housekeeping 1983.  I sort of turned them into tarts because it was less work.  I adapted a bit, as always.  Fudge Filled Tarts1 1/4 cup flour3 oz cream cheese, softened1/2 cup butter, softened1/2 cup sugar1/3 cup cocoa1/2 tsp vanilla1/2 tsp salt1 egg yolk4 T softened1/2 C. pecans, finely chopped1) Combine flour, cream cheese, 1/2 c. softened butter in mixer or food processor.  Shape into a ball and roll out into pie crust consistency.  Cut into 2 inch squares, place squares into a mini muffin pan holes. 2) Beat sugar, cocoa, vanilla, salt, yolk and 4T butter.  Mix in pecans.

We even let our little guy chop a smaller one so he could drag one too.  Memories, oh, sweet memories.Grab your coffee/tea, sit back and see if you can feel the relaxation and enjoyment we felt as we took deep breaths of the cold air, felt the crunch snow under the boots and heard the squeals of excitement from our two legged kids and the subtle \"maas\" of our four legged kids.  Blissful.  Won't you come along?  This is exactly how I wanted my kids to grow up.  Thankful.

Why facebook must complicate matters is beyond me.  Anyway...In the blink of an eye, my family came to visit.  That's how long their stay always seems to last.  Minutes...even though it's really days.  The BOG came.  In some ways, I'm just like my dad.  Driven, busy, multitasker, umm...overwhelming at times.  In classic BOG fashion, he came with an agenda.  What most would do in a month, he does in 4 days.He's been gradually working on insulating our icebox/aka kitchen.  There's zero insulation the kitchen.  Big drafty windows catch the strong winds from the fields.  Pipes freeze.  There's dirt right under the thin floors.  The floor is much too cold to walk on with just socks.  And the our bonus room above the kitchen had just about all of the insulation displaced from a critter ages ago.  Pretty much we spent last year heating the outdoors when we tried to heat it.  And it is the kitchen...which is such a necessary room.  As the BOG said, the first year is just survival.  It will get better in time.  Last year, he insulated the attic.  Big difference.  This year, he insulated the wall and door in between the wood shed and kitchen.  Big difference already.   Not the best pictures, but this is all insulated now, thanks BOG. And he cleared it out and added shelves and pegs.  Love.And he helped with more firewood. It's mighty handy having the woodshed attached to the house. He covered this trap door: Which was the back door to this neat little cut out for storing wood. You could fill it from the wood shed and then walk into the house and get it from the cubby.  Pretty neat, although we don't need to store the wood there.  Because there was such a draft, I had this cubby filled with pillows. No more draft=a big cleanout=great storage.Or a drive through window.  Certainly a fun place for them to play!The BOG has also been working on windows.  These pics are from when we just moved in.  As you can see, they were in rough shape.Garage: Barn The BOG brought these windows home, preserved the old glass and made pressure treated windows using the old glass.  This isn't a little job, it's a huge job. And he did great work.  Looks marvelous, thank you!

{"title": "Thanksgiving Recap 2013", "date": null, "text": "You know, I almost didn't \"do\" the traditional Thanksgiving.  My family all came and left before the actual holiday.  Their visits were so quick that they came and went before the turkey thawed.  And then my husband had to work on Thanksgiving. It's *just* the four of us.  Do we need all the hoopla for just us?Silly me, of course we should \"do\" the traditional Thanksgiving.  Why not?You know what's funny?  When all was said and done, I looked at my husband and said, \"I used to feel like Thanksgiving was a big job in the kitchen, but after my days of canning craziness, Thanksgiving is a really not as much work as it seems.\"  We have a lot to be thankful for, which means we really should \"do\" Thanksgiving more often.  Plus, it's delicious. A few highlights: Helpers.  Three of them. The tallest took care of the bird. The two shorter ones seriously helped with every part.  From putting carrots into the roasting pan to putting potato peels in the compost to basting the turkey to mixing the dessert.  So thankful they love to be in the kitchen. The 1911 roasting pan that I got for a dollar (best dollar spent ever) and fresh herbs dried from our garden. My favorite dish:  Butternut squash and cranberry dressing.Serving on my antique dish set with hand embroidered napkins. Our sweet three year old said he'd get forks, we all wound up with lobster forks.  We do live in Maine, ya know. The temperature was warm enough for the 3 season porch.  The critters had their thanksgiving. And sweet girl stayed out of trouble (mostly).  Let me tell you, this is monumental.  The marvelous spread.  And they ate a lot. And by far, my favorite, she held her daddy's hand through a good portion of the meal.  Just because.Thankfulness abundant here."},

I let it lapse when we flew someplace, didn't know if we'd make it on a plane with sourdough starter.  It's going strong now.  We got our advent calendar up tonight and the kids made sourdough pretzels with me.  I think that sounds like a tradition to keep.  -I put new curtains up in the living room. It only took me 2 hours to decide what I wanted.  I *think* I like them.  It's really the biggest small decision that I can't stop overthinking.  My husband doesn't get why I even think about this for more than a half a second. -I'm excited about this \"Cookie Tag\"game.  I do love my desserts.  (And psst...I'm posting a cookie recipe for you tomorrow.).3) Randoms-Not the best pictures in quality (those kids move fast!), but it's sibling togetherness...which I love to see."},

{"title": "Mama Made: \"New\" Wool Dress", "date": null, "text": "We live in an 1880s farmhouse.  Fabulous to look at, but it's rather cold.  The kitchen, in particular, has no insulation under it. Just dirt.  And it's freezing down there, literally.  I always have something on my feet during the winter in this house and I also frequently wear wool to keep me warm.  Although sweet girl never seems cold, I wanted to make her some warmer dresses out of wool.  But you know how expensive wool is at the fabric store?  Expensive. So, I thrifted.  I bought the skirt on the left for $2.00.  I thought it would make an adorable and warm dress. And then I had this set of jammies she wore so much when she was crawling that there's a giant hole in one of the feet. I removed the hot pink zipper to put in the back of the dress.  And then this little gift bag provided me with the perfect color bow.  And with all these repurposed items, I found myself with a dress. For me?  She couldn't believe it! And dare I say I love it? And I love this sweet girl too. I used a McCallsl pattern that I bought for a whopping quarter at a thrift shop for the bodice.  And then I sort of made the bottom of the dress above fit the bodice.I put my hand on her belly after she was wearing it for a couple hours...toasty warm!Now I've completely caught the wool dress making bug.  I promise you, there will surely be another soon. It's...umm...already in the works.  You see, I told you I caught the wool dress making bug. And just for fun, a few \"selfie\" shots with sweet girl.  So thankful to have her.  It's also the Homemade Living Series Wednesday.  Check out these blogs!Today is:  Staci - http://lifeatcobblehillfarm.com/   Daisy - http://mymaplehillfarm.blogspot.com   Sue-The Little Acre That Could Next Wednesday is:Me!

{"title": "Apple Cider Vinegar", "date": null, "text": "This post is a continuation from apple picking (click here).  That's right, snow's starting to fly and I'm still chatting about apple picking.Way back after I had made oodles of goodies from said apples, I looked at the pile of peels and cores and couldn't toss them.  I was planning on giving them to the rabbit and chickens, but I decided to do something else.  Apple cider vinegar.  And I didn't tell you because I wasn't sure it was going to work.It totally worked. Seriously, this is likely the easiest thing I made ever.  I know I always say that about making yogurt, but this is even easier than making yogurt.Apple Cider Vinegar1) Toss cores and peels into large glass jar. 2) Fill jar with water.3) Cover with cloth and rubber band.4) Store in dark place (our pantry) for a few weeks (I did almost two months).5) Drain, strain and store.After a few weeks, you can smell it.  I dare say that I loved smelling the fermenting apples everytime I opened the pantry door.  They started looking like this:But of course, ended looking like this: I ended up with a gallon.  It tastes oh so good.  And it was free.  And it's good for you. A marvelous combination of pluses, if you ask me.  I like yummy and free, and good for you is a bonus.  It's a little different from the store, because there's this thing called the 'mother' that is a glob of stuff that is totally normal, but store apple cider vinegar doesn't have that 'mother' because it's pasteurized.  Oodles of info on that online, just google. What to do with it?We'll mostly do salad dressings-we're getting back to making all our own again.  I might try to clean with it.  I clean with white vinegar that I buy, but I'd totally switch to free that I make if it works.  Also, my friend told me adding a small amount to rabbits' water helps their urine smell less potent.  Might try that.Now your turn-tell me if you've given it a try before.  Or tell me if you think you'll use your scraps next apple season to give it a whirl."},

We loved living there. It was our first home, the home we brought our babies home to.  Our favorite place to be when life elsewhere was overwhelming.  Our favorite place to be together.  So many memories there. But you know, when your dream farmhouse comes on the market, things change. Everything happened as it was supposed to.  I had no reason to worry.  Nevertheless, I feel elated today.  Elated not only because we have only one home now, but because we are so happy with who ended up with that house, and we're excited for them to begin their journey.Goodbye, our dear cape.  We loved you so.   It's not ours any longer, but these memories will forever be mine.      Really, there's many sweet memories that I'll always hold.  But there's also oodles more to make on our farm.  So thankful.  Thankful, indeed."},

The backing and insert are made from an old sheet.Given someone I know has an intense love for cows, I thought I'd make him a custom rice bag.He loves it.Three page pattern to print here. Cow Rice Bag InstructionsOptions:A) Make a rice bag insert and a separate cow patterned slip cover to go over the rice bag (easiest for washing).ORb) Make the cow pattern into a beanbag (fewest # of steps).NOTE: Seam allowances 1/4 inch for cover, 5/8 inch for rice bag insert. 1) Cut out your pieces-cow print face and two ear pieces- pink nose and two ear pieces-two white eyes-backing-an old sheet is perfect (two pieces for option A, one piece for option B) 2) Pin and applique nose onto face. 3)  Use a satin stitch (long zig zag with short length) to applique nose and mouth. 4) Place pink and cow print ears right sides together.  Stitch two lateral sides of triangle together.  Turn right side out, press.  Make an accordion fold along the ear, baste along edge.5) Pin ears to cow face.  Baste in place.6) Baste along edges of both circles.  Pull loose threads so the edges pucker to form a circle.Pin to cow face. Hand stitch in place.  Use satin stitch to make eyeballs in the white's center.7) For option A finish straight edges of backing pieces.  (Skip for Option B) 8) Pin both pieces of backing to cow face, overlapping folds for option A.  Stitch along entire outer edge for option A.  For option B, pin face to the backing, right sides together.  Stitch along edge, leaving a two inch gap.  For both options, turn inside out and press. For option B, finish by filling with rice and hand stitch to close.10) For option A, make the rice bag by placing two pieces right sides together.  Stitch with 5/8 seam allowance all except 2 inches along outside seam.  Turn right side out, fill with rice, hand stitch to close. 11) How to insert ricebag into cover for Option A. Finished! I hope you'll make one too!

{"title": "Thrifted. Updates. Randoms. ", "date": null, "text": "Fair warning: Today is another miscellaneous round. A) A couple more rounds of thrifting.I drove past an antique store that said \"Entire Store, 50%+ off\".  It might as well have said \"Jackie, you KNOW you NEED to stop.\"Anyway, I have this unspoken list of things that I am always looking for when I thrift.  I've been looking for a plate rack that would fit my counter tops.  This is a fab vintage one that I got for $5.00.  Plus two vintage plates for a dollar a piece. Plus this little hand stitched number for two dollars.  Can't buy all this new for $9.00.Did I need art work? Nope.  But it totally belongs here.And then a thrift shop.LL Bean 100% wool sweater, brand new book with pages that slide, four puzzles, boots for baby girl, LL Bean boots for my big boy, a hat that says \"exercise\" and a wooden puzzle.   $6.00. B) Updates.1) I am sitting down after a very busy day of work and then coming home and making 6 loaves of bread, finishing 13 quarts of pears, another fabulous batch of brownies with hazelnut drizzle and folding 6 loads of laundry. Kitchen is only semi clean and laundry is half put away. But I'm calling it good enough.  I'm thankful my little ones love doing chores with me, such special times we share.2) I totally linger in the kitchen after the jars are pulled from the canner, just to hear the pop.3) My brother and his girlfriend are flying in tomorrow.  I'm pumped.4) My husband commented that he knows what season it is by how much I sew.  It's sewing season now.5) I was asked to be a guest speaker at the Annual Maine Down Syndrome Conference this past weekend, wearing my professional hat. Such remarkable families I had the pleasure of meeting.  It was in Portland, Maine.  Not far from us, but we don't do urban stuff too often.  Not that Portland is *that* urban, but it's more urban than we usually do. My husband and kids came too-he brought them for a run in the jogging stroller while I was speaking. Goodness, my kids LOVED the city.  It was sort of like a giant outing to them. So much to see and do.  I forget that sort of thing is stuff they haven't experienced and they really ought to, given we live so close.  C) Random pics of said \"urban\" outing.    When all was said and done, that night before bed, my Adrian said \"Mama, I loved the city so much, but I love being a farmer best.\"  Oh, I understand you completely, sweet boy.  I really do."},

{"title": "Apple Cider Doughnuts", "date": null, "text": "Mmm.  Apple cider doughnuts (which I'll always spell doughnuts that way, the way my mom did).  This isn't the first time I've tried to get these right.  This is the first worthy recipe to share. They're good.  It's originally an Ina Garten recipe that was adapted. Did I ever tell you my husband had a chance to cook with Ina?  We have a framed picture of the two of them together.  That's back when he was in the cooking business.  He quit all that cooking stuff once we got married, professionally and at home.  Oh well.Anyway, he totally approved of these.  I made a huge batch with my littles and they are stored cut out and uncooked in freezer bags lined with wax paper in the freezer.  Most every weekend, I have been taking out *just* enough for us to have a sample when I waked up.  By the time morning animal chores are done, they're thawed enough to fry.  Although the husband would much prefer to indulge in the whole batch at once, this little weekend treat has become a hit. Anyway, they're really good. Apple Cider Doughnuts (adapted recipe from here).1 1/2 cup of apple cider1 1/2 cups sugar1 egg3/4 cups milk2 tablespoons butter, melted2 teaspoons vanilla1 teaspoon baking powder1 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon cinnamon1/2 teaspoon nutmeg1/2 teaspoon salt4-5 cups all-purpose flour 1) Pour apple cider into saucepan.  Let simmer until it's reduced to 3/4 cup. Cool to luke warm.2) Pour into mixing bowl. Add sugar, mix.  Add egg, milk, butter and vanilla. Mix.  Add baking powder, baking soda, cinn., nutmeg and half the flour.  Mix.  Gradually knead in the remaining flour to form a somewhat stiff dough.3) Roll 1/2 inch thick on floured surface.  Use doughnut cutter to cut out doughnuts.4) Fry for 2 minutes on each side.5) Dip in sugar and enjoy.The best part about making these?  The help I get.  Always eager, always willing.  It's a little slice of heaven baking with my kids."},

I finished this at night and almost woke my kids up to give it to them.  Thankfully, their enthusiasm matched mine.It all started out with my son's love for turnout blankets.  He was using washcloths.  I decided to make him his own for his little horse.  And then, I got carried away. (Surprising, right?!)Anyway, here it is.  I remember my pretend play days as a kid, and this just makes me giddy with excitement.  So, what's in it...A \"Ty\" beanie baby horse that a friend gave us. A lightweight and a heavyweight turnout blanket that I made. Bridle/reins that I made (with my new clever snap apparatus!) Miniature blocks for making fences and horse jumps (thrifted...paid a buck). Two metal buckets.A baby brush that I have never had to use since my babies are bald.A homemade felt apple and carrot (not sewn to size because I have learned that little pieces get lost). And perhaps his favorite part...little hair ties that are perfect for bandaging up the legs on the horse. I threw in one of our dollhouse people...and we have a set. They fit perfectly into this wooden thrifted box that I couldn't pass up. It's so easy to travel with.  All of this, I pretty much had around the house or got for a dollar or two at a thrift shop.  And now it's a marvelous set for next to nothing.  Goodness, he loves it. Hours of fun. Fun for the whole family.And in case you missed my other playsets...Here's the puppy playset:And here's the bear playset: And now the horse playset.  And I can't wait to dream up of another."},
{"title": "One Year Ago.", "date": null, "text": "I was sitting here thinking about what was going on in our life one year ago.  We a 4 month old and a 2 year old. I had just gone back to work a couple weeks prior from maternity leave and was dealing with all the crazy emotions that went along with that.  And we had just closed on the house of our dreams.  It was a \"that house\"/\"this house\" period in our life.  And everything was breaking and all that could go wrong, well, was.  We were half living in one house and half living in the other house.  My husband was working a lot of overtime, not by choice. No one was sleeping hardly at all. Our two year old was still adjusting to all the changes. I could barely pull together the typical meals I'd usually make and we resorted to much store bought, which the change in diet I don't think helped.  All between all this, I was trying so hard to be the mama I wanted to be-there emotionally and physically, playing and teaching all the way.Goodness, the mix of emotions at that point.  Elated.  Excited. Appreciative.  Overwhelmed.  Worried.  Exhausted beyond belief.  Feeling like everything in my life at that point I wasn't able to give 100%.  Feeling scattered, disorganized, dare I say, a failure?  It's true, I felt all those feelings.   I know if you were a reader back then that you probably didn't know the extent to which I was struggling, but I was.  I cried a lot.  I didn't know if we would ever be fully moved.Looking back, I should have insisted on time off from work to move.  I was feeling so guilty from leaving my families for the full maternity leave that I didn't feel right leaving them to move.  We shouldn't have taken it upon ourselves to move.  I stink at asking for help, so I didn't.  We should have hired movers.   I remember when my dad came after we were 3 weeks in and still very much living in between the two houses, he took it upon himself to just load and unload as much as he could for a couple days. He did soooo much work.  And I remember crying big sobs as I tried to thank him.  He took such a load off of my back.Well, it is now one year later and I almost forget those times when we were back and forth between the two homes.  That home, this home and back again.  But you know, we did it.  Those feelings are a distant memory. But I want to think of them again because, you know, there's a lesson in there.  It seemed like the bottom of the bottom in the moment.  But I was on the cusp of something so much bigger.  I am living my dream now.  Yes, the transition could have been smother, but that was just temporary (Last year up, this year down).  Would I go through it all to be where we are at today?  Absolutely.  Things really do work out as they should, it really was quite needless to worry so.  Must remember that...note to self.  There is no need to worry."},

Mix on low until dry ingredients are thoroughly combined. Add eggs, buttermilk, coffee, oil and vanilla. Beat on medium speed for about two minutes; the batter will be thin. Pour batter evenly into prepared pans.3. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes for round pans, 35 to 40 minutes for rectangular pan or until wooden toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks. Cool completely.Second, Make the Middle Snickers peanut butter frosting -no source, made up by me.3T butter, softened.1/8 cup smooth peanut butter2 cups powdered sugar (and I always cut some of the powdered sugar with flour to cut sweetness, this I did a half a cup)1/2 tsp vanillaSplash of milk8 'fun sized' snickers, chopped.Whip butter and peanut butter.  Add powdered sugar and vanilla.

And now that the introductions are out of the way, I bring you my latest obsession.  Dry goods canning, in the oven. Stay with me, I promise I'm not signing you up for something crazy.1) The goods.It's no secret that I'm a little...well...intense about preserving.  You remember that I make all of our own bread. Well, the pieces that don't get consumed, I just can't toss.  For ages, I've been letting them dry and then storing them until I have enough to process them.What to do with dried bread? Some ideas:-Toss in the food processor for bread crumbs.  -Use for stuffing (My particular favorites: broccoli-cauliflower casserole and butternut squash cranberry stuffing).-Use for bread pudding.-Make it croutons.-Toss in French Onion Soup. Not so crazy, right?  Making a little something out of nothing.There is a part right here that you'll think I lost my marbles.  I live with hungry hippos who eat entire loaves.  There has been a serious lacking of bread scraps.  So I....gulp....made 4 loaves of bread with the intention of dehydrating them.  I know...I know....crazy.After they were cooked, I cubed and put in the oven until they dehydrated.  I left them cubed so once we open a jar, we can make whatever we need with it.Helpers filled the jars.2) Now, how to can dried goods.  It's seriously the easiest thing ever. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Place jars in oven without tops. (I placed them in a deep dish pan so they wouldn't spill). Bake for one hour.  When they come out, place canning tops on the jars and then screw lid down tight. (I re-used tops that had been sealed before).  And you'll hear the popping/sealing.Worked great!  Even with used tops.Although this technique isn't good for items that could spoil, it works great to keep the dried goods air tight.  Much longer shelf life, for sure.I was super happy with the results. I did a lot of dehydrating early summer (due to having a broken chest freezer).  I went through and sealed those jars too.  And some stuff that was store bought (nothing that I suspected would be ruined through the process, though.)Safe to say, I sort of went crazy. Anyway, I'm hooked. Now it's your turn.  Have you done this before?  Do tell!  If not, go ahead and give a whril! :)Did you notice today is Homemade Living Series day?  I'm posting today with some other fabulous ladies.  Do check them out.

{"title": "Letter Fun/Play", "date": null, "text": "Oodles of thanks to my father in law/grampy for making us these pieces to create letters.  They're similar to those that come with a popular writing program.  So happy to have them.  My approach to 'teaching' letters is not teaching at all. I honestly don't care if they know their letters or not at their ages, but if they want to learn, I'll play along. I try to set up a 'literacy rich' environment, with books, of course, but also various letter type games.  They can play if they want, do something else if they'd rather.  Most often, since I hide things and pull them back out periodically, they tend to gravitate towards that which hasn't been available recently.  They have been loving doing letters lately.Which is exactly the type of fun I love catching them having.On the other hand, I have mixed feelings about this type of play that I caught them doing.  Come and see what I mean. He calls it 'the dump'.  How you play is combining every.single.puzzle piece with dollhouse furniture and whatever toy you can find.  Let me tell you, this picture is just the beginning of what they did.  Creative, yes.  Were they getting along? Yes.  Gave mama heart papalations?  Absolutely.  I tried to tell them the transfer station is ORGANIZED.  Paper here.  Metal here.  Trashbags here.  Compost here.  ORGANIZED dump play is good, don't you think? Maybe this could be the paper section and you could pretend all the stacking rings are paper...and over here could be the plastics... No, I was the only one who thought organized play was a good idea.I had to tell myself to look away.  I couldn't watch. Couldn't look at the disorganized mess. But...they were having fun.  They were being good.  They were getting along.  They were working together.  Listening from the next room made me smile.  Memories in the making.  I let them play dump.  And wow, they had a dump that was larger than our town's.I guess I'm just lucky all that mess got there via a steer and a wagon. Just think of how much bigger the mess would have been if he used a tractor trailer to do the hauling.  I I managed to make a game out of the cleaning up....and they did help.  Turns out, I had no reason to worry.  Playing dump isn't so bad after all."},

Get thrifting.  I have so much new and like new stuff for my kiddos for Christmas.B)Updates. -I'm *still* not done preserving.  30 qt. of pear sauce last week.  14 qt. of apple sauce this week.  Parsley drying.  Oregano drying.  Cabbage and carrots waiting on the counter.  Still a few lingering things I need to do something with.  But in the meantime, there's been a bit of time for some yummy treats (apple turnovers, anyone?!).- I was talking with my husband today that I am amazed how helpful our kids are.  Yes, one is 3 and the other is just shy of 16 months, but they are really, really helpful.   All I did was dig and they found the carrots and put them in the bucket.  They hand me items to be line dried one by one.  He helped me plant garlic, handing me each bulb.  I made a stew today (all ingredients but one onion from us!) and my 3 year old washed all the carrots.  My 15 month old put each scrap into the bowl for chicken treats.  They load their plates into the dishwasher.  I moved the plates and such down low, so they can unload the dishwasher. They wipe the table. Unload the dryer. We stacked wood today and both of them worked for an entire hour, taking smaller pieces and putting them in the woodshed one by one.  They do so much of the animal care.  They each have a new broom and they are really getting good at sweeping. Surely, there are sometimes that they are less than helpful (wanting to dig back up the strawberries I *just* transplanted), but the majority of the time, I not only enjoy their company, but I appreciate their help, too.  Here he is retrieving kale from the garden all by himself, as requested.  I just love that I can send him to the garden to get kale and he knows exactly what to do. -Wood fires make me happy.-She's *still* asking to read about horses, daily.-Farmer Rick arranged a deal with my little farmer.  If Adrian helps with haying next year, Farmer Rick will give Adrian enough hay for his goats.  \"Wow, that's so cool.  Good idea.\" Was the verdict.-There's much I had in mind to do this Halloween.  However, a little boy who hasn't napped in days paired with multiple Halloween events= behavior that was out of character.  I cancelled our plans.  At first I felt like a mean mama.  But then I remember, behavior is a communication and he was clearly communicating he needed some 1:1 time with his mama.  Missing out one one event didn't mean he was losing Halloween. Sometimes it takes a little thinking to separate the 'have to' with the 'like to'.   It was a chance for us to get re-balanced as a mama with her littles.  We were outside with the animals, working in the garden, having some timeless time together.  It was just what we needed.  C) And some random pictures that I took a bit ago of us out and about, but like.  Thought I'd share.Everything must stop with a chainsaw sighting.This is the exact sound the chainsaws make.  Can't you hear it?   Yeah, she's not participating in the 'make a chainsaw noise' game. And a random stoop where I just stopped and watched my kiddos.  A chance to slow down time and smile.Happy Friday, all!"},
{"title": "One year.", "date": null, "text": "One year ago today, we signed.  We were handed the keys.  I shed tears of happiness.  We unlocked the door for the very first time.  We walked around by ourselves, not visiting the previous owner, not paired with our real estate agent, assessors or inspectors.  Just the two of us 'grown-ups' and our 2 year old and 3 1/2 month old.  It was beyond surreal. We had a picnic on the living room floor.  Our voices echoed in a home that was completely empty.  I was dreaming of what it would look like filled with our stuff.  I was visualizing my two precious children growing up here, making memories.  This would be the place they would always call 'home'. After I went back to our other house, our original home, I wrote you this and posted this picture as tears were just running down my cheek. One year later, oh my, it's been quite the year.  A year of many ups and downs (in particular every appliance breaking), we're definitely settled in.  This last year will without doubt be the most challenging of all years.  So much that needed to be done, so much that I've wanted to do.  One year later, I can look back and see the progress.  So much has happened in a year, it's hard to put our first year on the farm into one post.  I'll try to sum it up.  The long and short of it?  It's ours.  And it finally feels like ours.  It feels like home.  Through winter,Spring. Summer   And fall.It's been a fabulous year of projects and memories. So, what have I done around this place?  Painting. Lots of it.  A bit of outdoor painting  and a lot of indoor painting. Remember wall paper, lots of it?  A lot of it is gone now. On my own, I have painted 7 rooms, two hallways and a stairway, just on the inside of our house.  My dad and husband helped refinish a wooden floor.  I stripped some linoleum. Oh my.  That does seem like a lot.  Here's the rundown. You can find links to lots of what we did under the \"Our Farmhouse\" subtitle on the right hand side.Living room painted.His room painted. Bathroom painted. Hallways painted.Playroom painted.   Three season porch painted.  Kitchen painted. Craft area painted. Carpets removed on porch, braided rug instead. Carpets ripped in bedroom.Sanded and sealed floors.  Linoleum ripped up in dining area, floors painted.Renovations have started in the majority of rooms.  There's still another bathroom, her room, guest room, entryway and another hallway that haven't been touched.  Maybe if my kids would actually sleep (ha!) I might have checked some more off the to do list.  With the exception of the hardwood floors above, all that was me and only me. Smaller projects have also been completed with help.  Such as woodfire insert,  Clothesline addedGetting this root cellar back in working order (which this picture is before it was filled...it's filled now..oh my!)  Filling this woodshed.  Lots of this barn cleaned out. And my dad has been working on restoring old windows.(...amazing work!)Plus, some things that don't photograph well, such as insulation.  Started that, but lots more to do, and many windows to replace.And gardens. Lots of cutting back and the goats clearing. We worked the garden that hasn't been worked in some time.  And raspberry hedges, the beginnings of an orchard, blueberry bushes.And we added animals.Layers.A bunny.Goats.My, when I look back on all that has been done in a year, it has been a lot.  Pair that with my desire to feed my family homemade and provide them with handmades, it's been busy.  Oh yea, and my 25hr a week day job.  Busy, yes, but never too busy to not appreciate the little moments that make us smile.  My, there's been many of those.  A year of memories, for sure.  So many more in store for us as we settle in deeper into our forever home.  Thanks for coming along with us.  We're so glad you are a part of this ride, too.Don't forget Wednesday Homemade Living series. Which I didn't forget yesterday, I just thought it was Tuesday yesterday.  I took a little time off this week and I'm all confused. It's not too late.

{"title": "Fall leaves.", "date": null, "text": "Fall leaves paired with little ones.  A perfect match, yes?  We really don't need to rake, as the wind just blows them away.  But I took advantage of the littered lawn and raked before they were gone.  Besides, I wanted to keep some for mulch next year anyway. Onto the pictures. Take 1:  Scene is early evening before nap.  He's an expert.  Most all my pictures are blurry of him, as he just kept going. Baby girl? She wasn't going near those leaves. I sort of put her in them.  She sat for 10 seconds and then stood up.  That was a terrible idea, communicated very clearly. Someone didn't notice and kept going. After watching him a bit, she thought there must be something to this leaf thing. She joined in by organizing them.  She removed them by hand time and time again and made a new pile. But when the dog entered the scene, she was *finally* brave enough. I could watch them all day. But wait, someone is coming.  Who could that be? And then this happened.Round one was quite memorable.  Scene 2:  The next morning, after breakfast.So not scary anymore.    I could totally watch them all day.  But I did for just a few...and then I jumped in and played too.  Raking leaves.  One of the very best parts of fall.  For sure."},

Climbing ladders, getting things to fit.  Old house love.  Much of that time I had a baby on my back and was trying to involve a 3 year old with as much 'appropriate' helping jobs.  Or I was trying to involved two littles.  Goodness, they were good.-A marvelous Halloween party with my Maine Besties and our families. Brought along some pumpkin whoopie pies (yes, I'll share the recipe).

She sprints to him when he comes home. When asked, she always says her best part of the day is \"Dada maaa\"....when dada brings her to the goats. Anytime he has a frown, her sweet demeanor always turns his frown upside down. Yes, today was a busy day, indeed.  But I didn't go so fast that I missed tiny special moments.  And there were so many of them today. I can't tell you how many times my husband and I locked our eyes, both of us emerging into a big smile, both of us communicating the same nonverbal message. \"Did you see that?  Couldn't your heart just explode? Is this the life you always wanted to have?  Can you believe we're so blessed?\" No words needed, just a look between two loving parents, silently communicating how grateful we are.  Doesn't get any better than that.  I really am blessed."},

{"title": "Homemade Living Take 4: Live. ", "date": null, "text": "So, this is the final four to wrap up my Homemade Living introduction.  (Don't worry, I will still have plenty to chat about with you on Wednesdays during my Homemade Living stay, this isn't an end, it's a beginning). For the 3rd post, \"Eat\", click here.For the 2nd post, \"Grow\", click here.For the 1st post, \"Stitch\", click here.By now, you know more about me and what I love.  Handmade, homegrown, DIY.  And now for the last installment: \"Live.\"  I thought I'd talk a little about how I try to live out the homemade lifestyle I love. I have to say, I get asked again and again \"How do you do it all?\"  Short answer.  I don't.  I know to some, I seem put together. But I'm not all the time.  I tend to show you my celebrations because that's what I have this blog for.  But balancing it all-the lifestyle I want to live, husband/young kids, and professional life can be challenging.  But it's what I want to do.  And therefore, I find ways to make my ideas come to fruition. Do you have things you'd like to do?  Learn a craft?  Grow something?  Make something a little more healthy?  I bet you do.  I bet there's something that you'd like to do or learn.  Here are my tips in getting going.1) Feeling settled.I admit it.  I am living my dream.  I am living in not just any farm house, but the farmhouse I fell in love with 7 years ago.  I have a great husband and two great kids.  I have the life.  I feel so blessed.But, before I had this house, I had an great home in the Maine woods.  Nothing wrong with it, we loved it and thought we'd retire there.  Before that? Apartments. I mentioned in other posts that I started this homesteading journey before we were homeowners.  In kitchens that were not my own, I baked.  Portable sewing machines went anywhere.  Small plants were grown in windowsills.   Small beginnings were happening.Point is, no matter where you are, you can start.  It's easy to say \"When I xyz, I will be able to xyz.\"  If we're always wishing away our tomorrows, it's hard to be settled in our todays. True, you might not be set up for cattle, but you might be set up to do something on a smaller scale in your kitchen.  Or you may be able to learn about something that you are not able to do yet. Feel settled where you are and know you can start to reach your dreams today. 2) Simplify.Simplify means something different to everyone. -For us, it meant omitting TV, cell phones and other similar forms of entertainment.-Fewer trips to the grocery store (we go every 3ish weeks-first week and a half fresh, 2nd frozen frequently) in favor of more time at home (just think of the hours we've gained weekly doing errands less often).-Toiletry runs are no more than monthly, we try to stretch to every other month.-We plan to be home.  Our outings are peaceful in nature whenever possible.   -Although I do frequently post on my thrifted finds, I do believe in less is more.  We don't have toys with batteries, hardly any out of plastic and we stick to the basics.  We do have stuff, but I am careful about what type of stuff we have. -Saying \"No thank you\" is okay. Many things we 'think' we have to do aren't really 'have to's' at at all. Although I do over-schedule myself at work, my kids are not over-scheduled.  We try to balance days at home with days that we are out and about.Now, do I expect you to do all of this?  No.  This is what we do that helps us have time at home paired with clear minds that are available to take on new challenges.   Simplifying might mean something different to you than it does here, but try to make your life more simple so you feel less distracted and have more energy for the things you want to do.3) Routine.So many of us thrive on routine, we are no exceptions.  Morning chores, breakfasts together, preparing meals together, evening routines.  Exercise and faith are big routines for us as well.The predictability helps us know what's to come.  We fall in rhythm, in sync with one another.  When my kids are feeling connected to me, they are very willing, interested and excited to branch out to do something different.  Everything I do is a willing new adventure to them, that they are equally as enthusiastic about, provided they feel balanced.See if setting up a more rhythmic pace to your time together helps you focus your intentions to where you'd like them to be.  4) Perspective. Sometimes I get caught up in the \"But I really was hoping to do XYZ\" or \"I can't believe I had the opportunity and I missed it.\" I have to remind myself that everything I do is a learning opportunity, a brief pause or a step in the right direction.  No matter what I do, it's something that happens along the process of doing what I'm hoping to do.  It's not all or nothing, big or small.  It's the best I can do, which is good enough, no matter how tiny the success is. Don't expect yourself to move mountains overnight.  Be realistic and manageable with your ideas.  That way you'll keep doing what you are hoping to do for yourself and your family.5) Vision.I have a list.  An extensive list that keeps playing in my brain.  I have an idea of where I'd want to be next year, five years and ten years from now in my journey.   I believe that as long as I keep plugging away, each celebration is me conquering my to do list.Brainstorm your own set of goals.  And believe you can do it.  I know you can.Now your turn.  Do you have things you're working on to have yourself a more homemade life?  Or are you interested in getting started, one small step at a time, in having a more homemade life?  Looking for some more inspiration?  These ladies have it.  Each one of them is trying to better their homemade lifestyle.  Inspiring.  Do check them out.  Although I'll be a regular blogger in between, I'll be joining the Homemade Living Series again in 2 weeks time.  This time, sharing something homemade.

In John Deere apparel, naturally.  Goodness, they both love looking at the feed, the wood shavings, the hay, the forklift. They both talk about it long after we've been.  Adrian really wants to take cow feed home (ummm....we have now cow) and Audra loves to point to all the sheep (her fave).  They were having a little festival and they invited Adrian to sell his bread to earn money for his cow.  (Thank you to everyone's kindness!) And there was a blue grass band. But that which was most exciting were the steers. Two teams.  And you'd think we gave our kids the moon.  Audra kept saying \"I want moo. I want moo.\" And we'd try to slow her down from sprinting back and forth between them.  It's hard to get good pictures of her because she moves so fast!  But I tried.  And Adrian spent his time grinning, and dreaming of having his own.  They were a little scared of sweet girl, but she had no fear. He also has no fear.  Instead, such admiration and longing. And this grin didn't leave his face. I may have went *slightly* overboard with the pictures, but come on now...isn't this grin irresistible? And this picture?  I think I need to frame it.And you know what he got to do?  He got to lead these guys.  Probably the highlight of his life. He already has the yoke, he just needs steers.  Come spring, little guy.  We hope to get you your own team.   I never imagined I would be raising a pair farmers.

I love making outerwear for my kids best, as there's nothing that will get more use than a coat living in Maine.  (Note: I used a too big hanger to take this pic, which makes it look like the collars are uneven.  They are not in real life, it's bugging me in the picture.) I made it big, hoping to let the seams out as she grows.  Here's the details.  Vintage thrifted buttons.  Thrifted fabric. Thrifted pattern. A little puff to the sleeves, Anne of Green Gables would be envious. Some mama embroidery. It's lined with my husbands old coat.  He was going to toss because the zipper was broken and it wasn't his favorite coat anyway.  Can't have that. It's really warm. I gave you a sneak peek of the pattern when I showed you my craft room. And I love the finished product.  I'll take you through the steps of trying to get a little model to actually model.  She was busy.  With the bunny. With buckets she found inside (ash buckets to be exact).  But then she ventured outside. And found her outside buckets.  (She loves buckets, talks about them regularly.)   But then there was a dog to chase. It's tiring trying to catch this one!  Like her brother's coat, I want this one to serve as a Halloween costume too.  I'm thinking of what to do to make it into a costume.  If you have any ideas, run them by me."},

Balancing it all is sometimes hard.  Some days are just hard.  Today was hard.But, I write you...why???Because when I write, I look back and shake my head.  I think, why on earth am I focusing on what's hard when I have so many blessings?I am confident that I helped kids today at work.  Today in particular, I know I helped a lot.  The paperwork is annoying, but I gave my time for the benefit of others.  And they're thankful and we're all celebrating.  And my kids had a great day with their dad and grampy and couldn't wait to tell me about it.  That's a celebration right there.I have the most marvelous home to come home to.  Filled with good food (although leftovers), fantastic animals and amazing kids.When I got home, I came home to cheers from my littles.  I hear from one, \"Mama, I'm so happy you're home. I love you, mama!  You're my best mama in my world.\"  And I hear from the other, \"Up, mama\". And then I hear \"Mama, I want to read oodles of farm books.\" And just like that, we're snuggled in early, learning about saddles and pastures and Holsteins. And when she's not feeling well, she wants me. I can make everything all better for her. And I get a warm body, a fuzzy head and those rhythmic breaths against me.  And then I wonder what what was hard today?  I've forgotten.2) More thrifted posts.  My $5.00 weekly splurge. That's all I allow myself with the owning two homes thing.  Saving for Christmas an the like. Again, backed up with much I haven't shown you.  Vintage microscope, giant puzzle and vintage dishes.  $5.00.Two games for when they're older, two like new pairs of shoes for them to grow into, a pair of baby shoes that I couldn't refuse and a whole magic kit, book included.  $4.75.3) And for the randoms.-The frost still hasn't been tough enough to get the garden completely. I thought the peppers were done, and went out to pick a five gallon bucket. -But we did bid farewell to the last of the cucumbers in the fridge.   (Goat cheese, dates and fresh basil-yum!).  -I thought I had a huge patch of Japanese Lanterns.  Instead they're tomatillos.   They're all over out there. How marvelous is that? Next year hope to pick them before they pass. -And potatoes.  Haven't grown them since I was a kid.  I randomly threw in some red bliss. Cutting two potatoes at the beginning of the season and planting them yielded a five gallon bucket.  Adrian said digging tatos was the happiest part of his day.   We will be planting more potatoes next year, I've forgotten how delicious they are.  And easy too.  I mean, we do live in Maine and potatoes are a Maine thing. Next year... And these kids loooooved digging them. And preserving.  And collecting squash.  Yup, a bit of that here and there. And some pumpkins.  And the last of the sunflowers. And eggs. Goodness, eggs.  Those girls are laying up a storm. -I've been trying to keep a steady supply of mini muffins for on the go snacks.  Sometimes we have had crackers, and I'm trying to eliminate that when we're on the road.  I have containers filled with mini muffins in the freezer.  I grab an assortment before we leave and they're unthawed by the time we need them. Zucchini and banana muffins here.  Cranberry orange and pumpkin muffins coming up this week, I hope. (Recipes above). Fall is so lovely here. I mentioned to my husband that I haven't noticed the leaves enough this year.  So, I snapped a quick picture in transit as a reminder.  Don't let time go so fast that you miss the little things, Jackie.  So now that I have written a book, I shall go to bed and remember all that's grand.  That right there is why blogging is so good for me.  If you made it through all that, thank you for being a reader and tolerating my stream of consciousness. :)  So, our goats \"John Deere\" and \"McCormick Farmall\" have been here a month now. (Did you miss their grand arrival?  Look here.) It's like we've always had them.  We all love having them so much.  If there's a kid missing, they can be found with the goats.  Audra says \"I want maaaa\".   Adrian says \"I'm a good farmer. I take care of my goats.\"  Even my husband is smitten.  They're kind, gentle, spirited and fun.  Did I mention we love them?  Here's some shots of our goats the first month on the farm.  They even help him with his new favorite pastime, collecting 'wood' for our fireplace.   We got them as pets for our little Adrian and also to clear land.  They have done an amazing job!The old 'mothering' pasture is next to the barn. The mama cows would calve here, so the previous owners could keep tabs on them.  It is still so overgrown that you can't even walk through there.  It's all raspberries and wild roses too-thorny messes. I've been following the goats daily to clip with hedge sheers what's left after they eat the leaves. Lots has been cleared, but goodness, there's much to go.  This is what the pasture looks like.  Probably a couple acres of this.  And this is what goats do to that jungle. Amazing, huh?! (Also take note the new windows in the barn on the left.  The BOG made pressure treated windows to fit the spaces.  He used old glass that was here before.  He's done finished the rest, just waiting to install. How awesome is that?!).  This run right here will be for the chickens.  We haven't been letting them out because a couple got stuck in that thick brush.  As soon as we can figure out how to get that door open (it won't budge), we'll have a chicken run.  How marvelous is that?!This is what it looked like the beginning of summer. I wish I would have taken a picture of the end of the summer mess before the goats took charge.  Thankful they're still up for the job. It's a mighty big one.I have a feeling we will always have goats on this farm now.  We're hooked.  Every picture I post of them, I think \"Wow, they really belong here.\"  As for my little farmers, they're thrilled, indeed. (Note the magazine he's reading, given to him by our friends at the local feed store.)But of course, this one still has his mind on what's next to come.  All in time, little guy.  All in time. Don't forget to check out the Homemade Living Series.  Staci, Daisy will be returning with fabulous posts and we welcome my personal pal, Sue to the mix.  Check them out!  Today is:   Staci - http://lifeatcobblehillfarm.com/   Daisy - http://mymaplehillfarm.blogspot.com   Sue-The Little Acre That Could!  Next Wednesday is: Me!

{"title": "(Another) County Fair", "date": null, "text": "On a whim, we ended up at (another) county fair.  My little farmers cannot get enough.  You should have seen his face when we told we were going to the fair.  Oh my goodness.  It's his Disney.  He said 'Mama, do you think Almanzo will be there?\"  Bless his heart, he wanted to see Almanzo from the Little House on the Prairie book Farmer Boy. It's funny...we read the \"My Little House\" books and he loves Almanzo.  He really wants to meet him.  He doesn't understand that the books about Almanzo are from a long time ago.  When we read them, he thinks we're just like Almanzo.  'Mama, we do a garden too!'  'We have chickens too!'  'We tap trees for sap too!'  'Mama, we make pickles too!'  'We go to the county fair too!'  'We have a fire in our fireplace too!' And so forth.  I guess he doesn't know what 'old fashioned' is, as we sort of play old fashioned daily. Anyway, this fair was a bit too busy for my taste.  But the animals.  Oh the animals.  Five draft horse barns.  Three barns just for oxen.  A playground for the goats.  And tractors. And french fries. Cows for him.  Sheep for her (they make her giggle).  My kids loved it.  Although my camera came out much less than usual, that which I did take came out as winners in my book.  Perhaps you agree? (And you know, my Adrian has a yoke.  He's going to hitch up his cows to his yoke soon. Don't believe him?  He'll tell you the same story a dozen times.)  I'm tuckered out just looking at these shots.  What a day!  I'd brave the crowds again and again for these two little farmers."},

{"title": "Her boots.", "date": null, "text": "It's too late...again...that I'm sitting down to blog.  I've done a lot of things, but nothing very well today (which will be yesterday by the time you read this).  Things started, not completed.  Making bigger messes in the process.  You know what I mean.  And then I have an awake baby who just fell asleep in my arms...and I'm not brave enough to put her down yet.  And...you know...I sort of like that she wants to cuddle me.  Okay, not sort of.  I like it a lot.  Someday she won't want to snuggle me.  But she wants to be in my arms now. Her little warm body, the rhythmic breaths, her fuzzy little head nestled under my chin.  You see... I can't refuse. So, instead of bringing you what I had planned to bring you, I'll instead share with you her boots. She has wanted to wear them for some time, but each time she has taken a step with them on, the boots either fell off or she toppled over.  Frustrating for her.But just the other day, she discovered they *finally* fit!  Oh, she was so happy.  She kept bending over, pointing to them and saying \"boots\". And that little girl just wanted to march everywhere, now that those boots fit. She had a hard time taking her eyes off of them. Here she's giving her boots a round of applause.  Happy the boots made your day, sweet girl.  Watching you celebrate made mine."},
{"title": "Mama Made: Puppy Coat (Upcycled)", "date": null, "text": "Halloween.  A holiday I could take or leave. We'll do a bit of trick or treating for UNICEF. I grew up wearing lots of homemade costumes, hand me downs from my dad's cousin. Lovely stuff.  I'd love for my kids to sport handmade costumes too.  Only, if I go through all that work to make something for them, I want it to be worn more than once.  So, I decided to take a basic pattern and make it into a costume.Pattern is Oliver & S, link here. Fleece was thrifted for a dollar.  Buttons were thrifted and a part of a huge tin of buttons.  Lining was upcycled from two receiving blankets from his childhood.  And a friend gave me this bone fabric, fit perfectly. And I love it. I love that these receiving blankets used to keep him warm all swaddled up. Now they keep him warm in a different way.And here is my model.  He told me once it was finished that he was never going to wear it.  Thankful he's coming around. Did you know this puppy can pant? Roll over.And beg?   It's been popping up random places...getting a little use. A Halloween costume, yes.  But a coat to last all winter? Even better. Particularly since Halloween in Maine always feels like mid winter anyway. And really, who can resist a little puppy anyway?"},
{"title": "Homemade Living Take 3: Eat.", "date": null, "text": "For last week's post, \"Grow\", click here.For the week's prior, \"Stitch\", click here.Is it Post three in this series already?  My how time flies. I guess it's a little more \"getting to know me\"...today's subject being \"Eat\".Warning.  There will be a lot of talk about food.  Many recipes are listed above in the \"recipe\" tab. If there's something you'd like to know just ask.I'm sitting here beginning to compose at 11:11pm.  Why so late?  Because I just completed a double batch of oatmeal raisin cookies.  I like for my husband to have a homemade treat when he comes home.  I also have everything prepped for the crockpot for tomorrow.  A ginormous batch of potato, cabbage and carrot soup. All grown here.  Our garden to table, that's how I like it best.  Yes, I ought to be sleeping, as I am working tomorrow.  But food is something I'm passionate about.  So it's worth the lost sleep, I hope.If you've been a reader long enough, you know that I am a bit..well...intense about that which we eat.  I try to grow and prepare as much as we're able.  Although I would gladly be a vegetarian if it wasn't for my husband's love of meat, we do consume some meat and that meat doesn't usually come from the supermarket.  We don't usually eat from boxes or packages, with the exception of a monthly pasta meal or crackers with a spread around the holidays.  I've even cut out cereal for breakfast.  I'm not saying the way we eat is what fits for everyone.  But for us, I aim to grow/raise or for each thing I buy to have only one ingredient.If you would have told me we would be where we are at today with most everything made from scratch, I would have said 'yeah right'.  Because we weren't even close when we first got married-7 1/2 years ago.  I remember looking in my grocery cart after our weekly trip and thinking...do I really need to buy all this stuff?!  I set a little challenge to myself.  I decided to pick one thing from the cart and see if I could work towards doing without it.  No time frame, just working at my own pace to reduce my weekly spending. Lots of trial and error, but working towards a goal.I started with eliminating paper napkins and heading the cloth route.  And then paper towels.  And then I was hooked. From that point forward, I have been picking something and working at it.  7 1/2 years later, I am still at it.  I have a ways to go, but I'm gradually becoming more homemade and more self sufficient.Here's the kinds of things I've worked on eliminating and making my own.  Dessert is my ultimate fave, so of course that's in the mix.  But, these are all things I've gotten rid of and I now make on our own.Many frozen/canned fruits/veggies.  We eat a lot of fruits/veggies..so we try our best to grow/preserve/eat our own throughout the year.  And eggs.  And meat mostly from my dad (who is a hunter).  That's the bulk of our diet.  Here's what else we eat:Brownie mixes Soups in a can (I used to eat Campbell's chunky regularly) Pie crusts in a boxCake mixesFrostingStore bought bread Holiday rollsCinnamon rolls Store bought English MuffinsPackaged rice mixes Hamburger helpers (my husband loves these!) Salad DressingsJams Yogurt Bisquick for waffles/pancakesReplacements for breakfast cerealsNutrigrain barsGranola barsBread crumbsHamburger buns  CroutonsDoughnutsVanillaChocolate sauceGranolaAnd non food items:-All household cleaners-Laundry soap/fabric softener/dryer sheets Pizza saucePizza crustRelishApplesauceWorking on:Coffee Creamer (we still occasionally buy/occasionally make) Vinegar (my first round is going so awesome!)Ketchup (first time, kids approved)More variety of salad dressingsIn the future I want to work on:BagelsMayo Sweetened condensed milkI'm sure there's more to all categories...and the list goes on...So, you see, I haven't always been crazy. It's been a gradual process of eliminating something and working towards more from scratch living.  And now the challenge...can you do the same?  Can you look in your shopping cart the next time you are at the store and identify one thing to work on eliminating?  I know you can do it!  I'm posting today, along with:Tammy- http://www.ourneckofthewoods.net/Mary - http://homegrownonthehill.blogspot.comNext Wednesday is:Staci - http://lifeatcobblehillfarm.com/   Daisy - http://mymaplehillfarm.blogspot.com   Sue- http://thelittleacrethatcould.blogspot.com/"},
{"title": "At play", "date": null, "text": "So, I guess this post is a continuation from yesterday's.  I started to talk about their play and that got me thinking some more.  Goodness, I love watching kids at play.  It's even more remarkable watching one's own little ones at play.The subject of their play is what I find most entertaining.  Kids most often play that which they see.  Except for when we were moving (which was almost a year ago), my kids really haven't watched TV on my watch.  Their ideas are either from books or from the people around them.  I find them acting out the things I do regularly.  Which I find entertaining.My favorite thing that he does is babywear.  If I have a baby on my back, he wants the same.  If I have a front carry, he wants the same. Cuteness.  I found another clothes drying rack (thrifted for $5.00).  We didn't need it, but I was thinking of how fun they'd have 'helping' with laundry.   They love it.  One for each of them. He spends a lot of time farming.  Building fences, haying, stacking hay, feeding animals.  He had to get this fence done to keep that horse in. And stacking wood.  He loves to stack wood. I mentioned that yesterday.  We're outside and he's taken it upon himself to get ready for winter. Here's what he found and stacked, all on his own. This has been an ongoing process all week.  And here he is, trimming the dog's nails. And canning. He loves to play canning. Here he is driving to the store to get more canning lids.  In a John Deere, of course.Canning is a big job, you know.It's stored for winter here.And while I did put a stop to this play, the thought of him doing it makes me smile.  He was putting away our real eggs in his play kitchen.  He was going to make cupcakes.He's so much like his mama. He found this picture of a drum in a book. Focused for a whole hour putting stickers on it.  And made a fantastic drum.Sweet girl, although isn't quite at the pretend stage, definitely busies herself doing chores like mama.  She loves to organize laundry. And transfer laundry from washer to dryer, dryer to basket.Give her a wet cloth and she will wash anything in sight.She also enjoys feeding the animals, multiple times a day.It seems that I've rambled along enough about my kids and their play.  I don't even know how many of you have read this far.  Every kid has their own play interests, so I'm not telling you anything new.  I think the point I'm trying to make is I feel blessed.  Blessed to have had the time to teach, show and be with them.  Blessed that they love to be around me and love to do what I do.  Blessed that I have had yesterday and blessed to have today.  We're never sure what our future holds.  But I do know that right now, I have this minute of being with them, watching them, enjoying them.  So I'm going to soak it all in, love every minute, and keep my babies close in all that I do.  And today, I'm going to join in and play too."},

{"title": "Family days.", "date": null, "text": "Just a family day, with the four of us. Not much of an agenda.  We just drove.And stopped at the Shaker Museum.  They were having an apple festival.  Beautiful handmades, lots of antiques, great demonstrations of lost arts.  Usually I bring out my camera to help me slow time since I have a hard time slowing myself down on my own.  But on this day, we were already going at a nice, slow pace.  And I didn't take too many pictures. But I did bust out the camera for their first bounce house.  You know, I thought they'd love it.  They both went in there briefly, and were all set. But then, tucked away in a corner, we found horse rides. And my husband took the camera.  (Before I tell you this story, I should note that Adrian picked out his own outfit this day.  And no, it wasn't his birthday.  But with that 'Happy Birthday' tag, he got birthday wishes all day from strangers.)Anyway, Adrian wasn't sure at first. And no way would he do any of this without his mama.But he built his confidence up.   And goodness, he ended up loving it! He kept saying, even for days afterwards, \"I can't believe I rode a horse.  I just can't believe it.\"  He wants a horse now. Of course. But then, as we were all set with the hustle bustle of the festival, we were pulled in this direction. And I pulled that camera out.  I just wanted these images to last in my mind forever. As we were heading down that path, we spotted something. We didn't try to talk him out of marching over to see the John Deere.  He just *had* to go see that John Deere. I don't know where she ran off to, her dad chased her.   But I did let him climb on this random tractor in a random field, which of course, he was in his glory.  She eventually found us, gave the tractor a very brief whirl...and off she went.   He could have hung out there all day, just watching the stationary tractors. That quiet path led us to come cows.  Which they both love (and want).  Back down that beautiful path.    Such a beautiful family day, in more ways than one. We did pick apples thenafter, but I'm just as tuckered out going through the pictures now as he was then.  I'll show you those pictures when I get a chance.  All in all, this slower country living pace is what makes my heart smile."},

I say \"I can grow that!\"  and \"You can totally grow that!\"Now, my 'can do' attitude about growing things hasn't always panned out to be successful.  Every year, I have huge aspirations and no matter what I do, something I am trying to grow just doesn't..well...grow.  Even the experienced gardener has great years and not so great years.  That's the thing about gardening.  Sometimes it's bountiful, sometimes not so much.  The unfortunate part is that so many focus on their gardening failures and give up. Well, here I am to tell you that even if you haven't had success in the past, you CAN have success going forward.  Sure, not everything in my garden grew this year, but the majority did.  And we've been enjoying the harvest all summer long.Switching gears, I'll give you the background on how I became a gardener.I was raised on a 50 acre hobby farm. My parents planted a garden every year.  I can still see the rectangular plot all plowed and waiting for tiny seeds.  I see the large patch of rhubarb on the end.  I picture the vegetables we always planted thriving.  Corn, onions, peppers, peas, green and yellow beans, carrots, beets (NOT my fave), zucchini, summer squash, cucumbers, brussel sprouts, broccoli, potatoes, squash, pumpkins. I must be forgetting some. The part of the garden closest to the house was always relatively weed free, with the jungle of weeds at the end of the garden closest to the chickens. I entered some of our produce in the county fair, earning numerous blue ribbons.  Summer living included fresh produce, home picked. That's just how it was.I did have a gardening hiatus come college.  I did try once in an apartment building, but our patio wasn't lucky enough to receive any southern sun exposure.  Not much happened. When we bought our first house, my one requirement was enough land to have a garden.  We did buy that, but I underestimated how many trees needed to be removed for enough light our woody plot.  I did put some tomatoes in five gallon buckets and tried to enlist my husband to follow this tomato bucket moving schedule to \"catch\" the sun as best possible.  Yeah, so, he didn't play that game long.  Although I couldn't vegetable garden, I really dove into perennials.  It's amazing what you can grow in part shade to full shade!  I think I counted 60+ varieties I planted/maintained in a lot that really didn't have anything other than weeds before I started.  Although I couldn't grow vegetables, it was those years early in my marriage that I concentrated on perennials.  I see now how awesome it was that I couldn't grow veggies, as it was my opportunity to learn about perennials.My dear neighbors, who had become like-family knew how much I wanted to garden.  They offered up their farm, walking distance from our home.  I was over the moon excited.  The neighborhood team of horses plowed the land and I got started.  Years after proved to be quite interesting, especially given I'm the one who does planting in our household.  I planted very pregnant one year, harvested full term and preserved as a first time mom with a newborn.  Then I planted a large garden with a not quite one year old who was entirely too helpful.  Then I planted with a not quite two year old ready to pop.  And then preserved with my two helpers.  Given our garden wasn't such that I could tend it when my children were sleeping, it was quite the adventure.Fast forward to this year, I am living in the home of my dreams and have a garden where the original owners tended a garden for 100+ years.  It's a spot that fed a family of 7. This is the first year it has been worked in a number of years. Although a recent septic project led to sandy soil being deposited right on top of the beautiful soil (pft), it still produced a lot. It has been so nice to finally have our garden at my fingertips. And a greenhouse type setup facing south for seedlings (squee!). I can see the garden from my kitchen window. I can just go outside and harvest what I need for dinner.  It's been marvelous.So, what have I grown this year?  You can find previous gardening posts through linking here.  I'll try to remember what I planted.Fruits:Started apple trees, raspberry bushes, blueberry bushes and strawberries.Herbs: Basil, parsley, oregano, chives.Veggies:Tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, broccoli, onions, garlic, kale, swisschard, different types of lettuce, cucumbers, zucchini, summer squash, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, cabbage, green and yellow beans, peas, corn, butternut squash, acorn squash, spaghetti squash, sugar pumpkins.  I may be forgetting some, but all in all, a lot. Most all was from seeds, not bought as seedlings.  I also started some cosmos, sunflowers, marigolds and morning glories. And more perennials than I can count.As growing up, every meal this summer has been driven from garden harvests.  And there's always home grown flowers on the table. And I couldn't be happier.My challenge to you is to start thinking now what you can grow next year. If you're new, pick one thing and give it a whirl.  Keep at it.  I'm sure you'll develop your green thumb.And if you got through all that, make sure you pay attention to the next part.  A giveaway.  Yes, that's right.  Details here. Pretty much all you have to do is share my blog and tell me.  I keep my giveaway chance of winning fantastic (I've been known to make more if I have lots of entries).  So enter!  And thanks for reading along. I'm posting today, along with:Tammy- http://www.ourneckofthewoods.net/Mary - http://homegrownonthehill.blogspot.comNext Wednesday is:Staci - http://lifeatcobblehillfarm.com/   Daisy - http://mymaplehillfarm.blogspot.com   Amber - http://makingahome-pa.blogspot.com/"},
{"title": "Upcycled Mini Teddy Bear Playset", "date": null, "text": "My dad, who is notorious for bring crap I don't want, sometimes ends up bringing me a treasure.  He brought a bag of stuffed animals (who wants all those?!) and in it was this fab little mini vintage bear.  I was excited.  Nobody cared. Nobody played with the tiny bear.  I am pretty sure that tiny bear was feeling sad. So...I made this playset. I must say I am pretty excited about it!Some cute, simple little skirts out of scraps and elastic.Some flowered headbands out of elastic and felt. A cute sleeping bag out of vintage fabric. And then the rocking horse and the push cart I got at the thrift store for next to nothing. (I wrote about that here). Pop it in a fab wooden box and you've got a set!  And I'm excited!  It's the second play set I made.  Remember the last one? Link to puppy playset here.And the horse playset? It really gets played with a lot.  I hope this Mini Teddy Bear playset gets used a lot too.  I won't know until Christmas, as I'm saving it for then.  But maybe I'll just play with it a little by myself for a bit...because it is fun and all. I had so much fun making mine, I whipped up a second for my friend who is due with her baby girl anyday now.  I included a labeled drawstring bag as the gift bag.  Anyway, I totally recommend making a little playset.  It can be no sew.  Just gather a stuffed animal, washcloth, receiving blanket, small pillow, spoon, bowl, cup, toothbrush, etc.  Pop in a basket and you have your own playset.  The best part of having these playsets all together for little hands?  Watching and see what they come up with.  There's so much learning power to imaginary play.  And so much entertainment value watching them as adults.  Won't you join me and either make  stitch or stitch free playset?"},

There's still plenty of bug watching.  I could spend hours watching bugs.  Did I ever tell you I was big into entomology as a kid?   I caught, mounted and labeled oodles.  My shadowbox display even made it all the way to the great New York State Fair.  Blue ribbons all the way.  Anyway, I love insects.  I haven't seen a praying mantis in quite some time.  This one posed for me.  I could watch them all day.  Do you see the bright blob?  There it is flying away.  And some dragonfly love. There's still a bit of summer-like weather, but we know the weather is changing gears before our own eyes.  It's officially fall now by the calendar and by our activities. Work gloves have been sported.  We're getting ourselves ready for what's next. Wood is being stacked, things buttoned up and painted. I've dug the fall books out.  The windows are closed at night and we're wearing socks to bed. Halloween costumes are in the works and pumpkin baked goods are coming soon. The changing of seasons is always an exciting time, this one is no exception.  Tell me, readers...how are you changing gears?"},

And I think it dressed up our morning pancakes, don't you?And now for the randoms:1) Tomorrow will be the end of two weeks of flying solo.  I don't mind single parenting at all insofar as the work load, but I have missed having my husband here.2) The out of routine has not had a great impact on my kids' behavior.  So today, I brought them outside and I sat with some sunflowers.  I picked sunflower seeds with both of them helping.  Time stopped.  We talked.  They were sprawled out across me.  We relaxed. And just like that, our balance with the three of us returned.  Thankful for that.3) All of our meals are still based from garden items.  I love watching my kids eat-and enjoy- their veggies.  Even salads are scarfed up. I've been working on preserving.  Although we have less than we've had in years past, I am still working hard. Freezing broccoli, basil, beans.  Dehydrating kale and herbs.  Canning tomatoes, apple juice, apple sauce and apple butter.4) I find myself looking at my perennials, overwhelmed.  I go through thinking \"I did the best I could...this first year in this farmhouse\" to thinking \"Come on now, you didn't make the dent you wanted to this year, Jackie.\"  It is what it is.  And it's a mess.  But at least it's less of a mess than it was 10 months ago. (On a side note-you locals who would like perennials, let me know!)5) We've been getting 8-11 eggs a day.  Which is great!  More than we need right now, which is a blessing.  The kids would eat eggs for breakfast daily (especially paired with banana bread). I am eager to use up the eggs making important things-like brownies. 6) My dad asked if the novelty of having goats has petered off.  Umm...nope.  Nor has having chickens...and we've had them for years.  Long and short of it, I birthed two farmers.  This is their thing.  Even baby girl wakes up and busts out an animal sound or two, requesting to go out to see her pals.7)  I'm reminding you all of the giveaway that I'm doing right now.  Details here.   I'm more grateful for you readers these last two weeks. So many of you have been my company as I missed my husband.8) Happy weekend!  What's in store for you?"},

I made that and he changed his mind again.  Too late-Zucchini cake it was, which was plenty exciting.And a little cheering from a three year old-birthday surprises are good.   But, the very best surprise, by far was the arrival of a certain pair.  He didn't know they arrived.  I can't tell you as well as I could show you, so here the picture story...Oh, and the shirt is mama made.  Link and pattern here.  It was so magical watching him discover the goats he had worked so hard for.  All summer long he sold bread (recipe here), saved his money and talked about getting his goats.  And to see the five men in his life that he loves the most just light up to his reaction? Well, this picture makes my heart smile.Goodness was he excited!Such a sweet pair.   He was having some reservations earlier in the week.\"Mama, I don't want goats anymore\".\"What, why?!\"\"Mama, I know I'm a good chicken farmer, but I just don't know if I can be a good goat farmer too.\" He had nothing to worry about.  He's a natural goat farmer.Baby girl?  She loves them too.  She's also a natural with them.  Their names will be \"McCormick Farmall\" and \"John Deere\".  After tractors, naturally.  I had a bazillion other suggestions, but he said his goats are the best.  The best goats need the best names, naturally. A perfect fit.   (And a thank you shout out to who we got them from:  http://smallfarminwoods.blogspot.com/) He's most assuredly smitten with them.

{"title": "Homemade Living: Take 1.  Stitch.", "date": null, "text": "Today's post is a change from the usual posting.  I've been asked and graciously accepted joining in on some fun with some lovely ladies, posting about homemade living every other week.   I'm posting today, along with: Tammy- http://www.ourneckofthewoods.net/Mary - http://homegrownonthehill.blogspot.com Next Wednesday is:Staci - http://lifeatcobblehillfarm.com/   Daisy - http://mymaplehillfarm.blogspot.com   Amber - http://makingahome-pa.blogspot.com/  Separate from this series, I've been questioned a time or two how I got into this or that.  I guess I just got nipped by the homesteading bug and haven't stopped.  I thought I'd use this series to try to bring you along on my journey thus far and maybe give you some ideas on how you can get started/encourage your little ones to climb aboard the homemade life.  I'm planning of diving into my interests in a few categories:  Stitch. Grow.  Eat.  Live. Four simple words that are packed with so much 'doing'.  These four little words are what \"Homemade Living\" means to me.   I always picture a little bit of homemade is like adding an extra hug to your loved ones. Who doesn't love hugs?  Give the homemade kind.  What can you create?Take one is today.  Stitch.My Early love.Stitching was my earliest form of homemade love. I learned on my grandmother's treadle sewing machine, eventually graduating to the Singer she bought with her wedding money.  I remember sitting in her back room, feeling the piles of fabrics, letting the buttons trickle between my fingers, stacking the wooden spools and organizing the boxes of notions.  We'd sew doll clothes and I'd mass produce pillowcase dolls.  I don't know how old I was when I ordered and received my very first sewing machine. It was a purple Singer.  It had a straight stitch and a zig zag stitch. I was confident that I could create anything.  And I did. I sold scrunchies (remember those?). I learned through 4-H, making outfits that I loved in true 1980 fashion.  These early experiences gave me confidence. Your Early Love.It's never too early or too late to learn.  Sewing takes patience and determination.  If you have a sprinkle of those qualities, you, too can create.  For little ones, don't underestimate the power of lacing cards or a blank hoop with a needle and thread.  Learning how to use your hands in different ways through needlework, knitting, crocheting or loom work helps set the beginning grounds of creativity.  Experiencing different options will help to find a true love.For the older one, who is still a beginner, pick a project and dive in.  The less cutting and seams are the best for beginning projects, particularly if you can just measure without needing a distinct pattern..  Try these pillowcase dolls, pillowcase dresses or pillow cases.  Stitch curtains, napkins, placemats or dish towels.  Find a mentor, believe you can do it.  Before long, you won't believe what you whipped up. Pick something easy to start off with (there are ideas on top).My stitching love grows.As some teens get older, interests shift.  I was quite the contrary.  As a highschooler, I signed up for extra home ec, just for fun.  I convinced my home ec. teacher to let me stay after school so I could sneak in some more sewing before sports. I got a serger for my sweet 16 and my own beautiful Janome sewing machine for my 18th.  I made oodles of things.  My friends had custom made prom and graduation dresses.  I wore my own dresses out and about.  I found a great deal of contentment in those rocky years, just creating.Your growing stitching love.Once you tackle basic projects, dive into a pattern. There's oodles free online.  Buy a paper copy.  Some enjoy the digital version (me less so).  Most patterns have explicit directions, including a glossary of terms.  You CAN do it!Pick a pattern and go for it!There's even some free patterns linked above, this included. Getting intricate.I found my quilting love when I was 15.  It hasn't stopped.  There's something magical in the rhythm of methodologically creating something so beautiful out of sewing tiny pieces.  Quilting is not hard, not in the least.  I find having a few items (rotary cutter, clear rulers, a cutting mat, a walking foot) makes it easier to do.  I had some rough teenage years due to losing my mom and quilting became my therapy.  There's nothing like looking back at something you create after it's just finished.  There's such a sense of accomplishment and it's a bonus that it decorates your home. Give quilting a try!I learned from books.  Try small projects first-squares are much easier than triangles. It really is amazing what you can accomplish from sewing little squares together.  My first try.My latest. The great thing is, once you get started, you'll build your confidence to keep going.  I'll end this with a few snapshots of some homemade items in my life.  Where we are right now leads way to mostly things for my children. But your creating doesn't have to be geared towards little ones.  That's the beautiful part of being creative.  It can be whatever you want it to be.  There's oodles of links above detailing a lot of what I've done in the last few years.  Please, be inspired! Do explore, do create, and I'd love to see where your imagination takes you.  Loving stitches:  Remember, these are a few examples.  Continue your searches at the top tabs. Go ahead and be imaginative, create something spectacular.  I can't wait to see the results."},

You spent all summer selling bread and saving your money for a goat.  You spent an hour the other day decorating a box with stickers to make a drum.  You spent more than an hour moving sawdust into the chicken coop.  You have a long attention span for activities of your choice.  You always like to be busy.You eat most everything.  If you had to choose, you'd pick Nam bars (peanutbutter/chocolate bars), for sure.  You also love popsicles and bread fresh out of the oven.  Your favorite flavor of ice cream is strawberry.You're learning all sorts of things that interest you. You can rattle off the names of different tractor manufactures, chicken breeds, identifying garden produce and the names of wildflowers.  Just the other day, a friend gave you a flower and you told her \"That's golden rod\".  Makes us chuckle.Although you say you want to get rid of your sister, you really do love her.  You have been working hard and doing such a good job playing with her or trading her so she doesn't take yours.  You would read books all day long. Although tractors and trucks are your favorites, you have really been enjoying Bernstein Bears lately.  You're eager to learn about so much.You enjoy creating real baked goods for others with mama, as well as pretend play in your kitchen.  I marvel at the great spreads you whip up for your stuffed animals.  Sometimes you do some 'canning' in your play kitchen.  And you've been saving seeds to plant next year.  You are your mama's son, that's for sure.You have a special way of making people feel special.  You say kind things and do kind things.  You offer to help and you offer to share.  It's hard not to smile with much of what you say.  Below is your questions that I will repeat each year.  But before you read that, I will wrap this up by saying we love you more than we could ever imagine.  You are the most special little boy.  I know you hate when I have to leave you-I must admit I miss you every minute I'm gone.  I love that we are together always when we are home. I love having you by my side, chatting with you and snuggling with you.  I am thankful that we have had so many memories, have such a strong bond.

{"title": "Start a Tradition...", "date": null, "text": "Baked goods.  They're definitely a love of mine.  Without doubt.They bring happy, happy memories to my mind.  As a child, I remember pulling the yellow flip top stool over to the counter.  I'd crawl up, help measure, leveling the measuring cup with a knife.  I'd dump ingredients in the bowl carefully.  Grab that wooden spoon to help stir.  Taste test a little.  I'd be right next to my mom, talking continually at her, for sure.Although I usually helped her, sometimes I didn't.  Every now and then when my dad was home playing with us, we thought my mom was inside making/cleaning up after dinner.  She'd come out and surprise us with something fantastic. I distinctly remember her serving us Hot Crossed Buns when I was learning that delightful sound on the recorder.  Or sometimes we arrive home from a long day of school to find a plate of warm chocolate chip cookies.  Enjoying a seemingly spontaneous sweet treat with the sweetest mom ever was special beyond belief.Sometimes, I like to do the same.  My husband and I are so rarely home together that when we are, I usually have the kids as he does lawnmowing/something of that nature.  But this particular day, he had them both.  And I completed this scrumptious surprise for them.  It was well received, I'm telling you. Recipe HERE.   I'm hoping to keep that tradition alive-surprising my loved ones with sweet treats when they least expect it.  Won't you join me this week/day/month/year and make some goodies to surprise your loved ones when they least expect it?"},
{"title": "In reflection...Gardening 2013 Take 6", "date": null, "text": "Here's notes from the last garden go around.  So...gardening 2013.  Instead of telling you how I did, let me shift gears and tell me about those who have been more successful.There's these three women I know, two of which I've had the pleasure of visiting their farm the last couple weeks, the other friend although I'm too far to visit, we keep in touch.  Let me tell you, they are amazing women/moms providing for their families. Their husbands are pretty swell too.  You'd marvel at what they do and wonder how they do it all.One has a homestead of chickens, ducks, goats, turkeys, rabbits and pigs.  They have a marvelous garden and really have figured out which veggies they eat most and grow enough of those to last all winter. They're working on being self sustaining with reproduction their critters and saving seeds. Canning, freezing, the root cellar! The majority of what they eat, they raise or grow. Inspiring! The next friend has cows, chickens, bees and draft horses, complete with a wagon and sleigh.  They have a ginormous garden with tomatoes the size of my head! They have fruit trees that are plentiful.  You should see the size plot of cosmos she has.  She works full time and cans oodles. They're also fixing up their house. Amazing!My far away friend has a more urban plot far from Maine.  In the last year, she's added chickens and they built a coop that looks like a hotel.  They're gradually trying to increase what they can grow and are doing an awesome job starting from scratch!  Even with a toddler and being pregnant, she did lots of work spreading out this whole dumptruck full of mulch. And she's learning about dehydrating.  I'm motivated just seeing the great things they do!Well, there you have it.  The gurus to learn from and be inspired by. I know these three women are readers...and I'm giving you two thumbs up.Knowing these women, \"Really?\" is the answer I likely would get.  \"But we had a slow start.\"  \"We got it in late.\"  \"We didn't water enough.\"  \"We couldn't keep up with the weeds.\"  \"Everything didn't come.\"  \"We didn't get as much as a variety as we hoped.\" \"I wish we could have done better.\"That certainly isn't how I see their gardening year.  I see all the highlights and only the highlights. Truth be told, I didn't even notice any of the areas they thought were not perfect.  I look at their success with awe!I must admit, when I set out to write this post, I was going to list my soil woes, critter problems, failures.  But, I'm hoping that perhaps others can overlook that which isn't perfect and see my successes instead. I'm going to share my celebrations and skip my list of what I would do over.  It was our first year here and overall, the celebrations do triumph.I pick about this much every other day. Sometimes more, sometimes less. But always something.The majority of what we have consumed this summer has been from our garden.  I have home grown flowers in many rooms and have had so for months. I've never before started so many from seed indoors, to have them produce successfully outside.  I only bought a couple plants already started.I've never had much success with cauliflower.  But I've grown a few heads that are as big as mine.There's been a bit of extra to preserve.  And my kitchen has had/is still having a workout.  I've spent countless hours planting, watering, weeding and harvesting.  It's been my favorite place to be, for sure. It's been a place where my children have snacked, my family bonded and my kids have learned. It's all a matter of perspective.  I'm thankful I didn't write about my woes.  They're still there, but are much more cloudy after listing my celebrations.  And you, my dear readers, try to do the same.  That which you are doing to help your family isn't just a beginning, but a huge celebration for a job well done. And in other news...I'm excited to share with you that I've been asked and have agreed to join some super talented and energetic group of ladies in their Homemade Living Series.  Every other week on Wednesday, I'll be documenting what Homemade Living means to me.  Today, you can read homemade living tips and ideas from: Staci - http://lifeatcobblehillfarm.com/  Daisy - http://mymaplehillfarm.blogspot.com  Amber - http://makingahome-pa.blogspot.com/  Next Wednesday, I'll be joining and posting my own Tammy- http://www.ourneckofthewoods.net/Mary - http://homegrownonthehill.blogspot.com Good stuff to come your way!"},

Of course, I decided to grab that camera. My husband may have tried keep secret when he rolled his eyes at me, but I saw him. I ignored him and decided to spend a bit of time capturing some of our meals recently.  I'm no expert in the kitchen (although said husband is genius in the kitchen, he quit cooking when we married...I guess I can say whatever I want here, since I found out he just looks at the pictures and doesn't read what I say on the blog...ha!), but I try my best to make new meals all the time.  I seldom repeat within the year.  Here's some of what's in our summer rotation (except I left out the many many salad posts...I could do a whole post on salads one of these days!). If you want more info there may be the recipe up in the index on top, or just ask.  And I think I have a camera card full of more food pictures.  If you are interested in more garden fresh meal photos, I can go ahead and upload more next week. :)Get hungry.  Ready, set, go! Cucumber sticks with basil aoili.  Grilled cheese with tomatoes and avocado on homemade bread.Lemon basil fish, corn, kale chips and fresh bread.   Good old pasta salad with homemade Italian dressing. Summer veggie risotto and tabbouleh. Lots of garden veggies and herbs here. Stuffed summer squash with more tabbouleh. Homemade bread. Frittata with our eggs and veggies. Garden veggie fried rice with our eggs and homemade sauce.  Oh, and of course zucchini bread.(And yes, without doubt, my kids eat this stuff.  All of it.  They're so used to seeing different things that they hardly ever flinch when they see something they don't recognize.  If they're not a fan at first, we say, \"That's okay, you're not used to it yet.  Keep trying and you'll be used to it soon.\"  Thankful to have two healthy eaters.)   And we also do eat somethings that are semi homemade and not home grown.  Because, really, what type of mama would I be without letting my kids sample banana cream pie and s'mores.

He obviously didn't read that price tag.  I admit, I got a little teary eyed when I entered the 4-H building.  This is where I spent my childhood at the fair.  Exhibit upon exhibit. Ribbon upon ribbons. Some even earning the way to state fair.    We totally had this sign in our yard. And I totally salute my mom for what she did for us through 4-H.And they had these homestead stands, where you could submit an array of what you do around your homestead.  I totally want to do one of these!  And we let her out.  Which means we took a significant break from picture taking...When we caught her, the camera did come back out.   But we did see baby chicks.  Even some being born. And we had some delicious snacks.  These were from Adrian's favorite farmer-Farmer Rick.  He happened to be there and treated Adrian to french fries. There also was a whole building dedicated to flower arrangements.  And a building dedicated to antique stuff...it's crazy to see how much of the stuff in that building that either I own or the BOG owns.And I want this for canning: I also got a little nostalgic (should that be embarrassing?) when I walked into the rabbit barn.  I used to show my rabbits.   We were brave and let her out again.  And they both had their first lollipop.But of course, we had to have one last goodbye reserved for the cows.  Thankful this one belongs to my husband's friend.  This cow tolerates hugs from cow lovin' little boys.   I never thought I'd be a cow owner one day, but this talk about having cows hasn't let up in well over a year.  I am thinking it's not a phase, but a genuine love.  Having our own is a definite possibility. This sign sums it up nicely.  And now, if you got through all that, it's your turn.

Why you rip it all up?!  Stop that!\".  Either he has poor taste and loves yellow linoleum or he's attached to it because it's there and always has been. I worked on it for a while, but I ended up quitting  because it was a bigger project that I didn't have time for.  I finally did finish ripping up the dining part of the kitchen, I haven't gotten the chunk in the immediate cooking area.  It's certainly not perfect, but it's only temporary.  Someday when we only own one home, we'll put something else down.  But until then, I much prefer a gray painted floor to the terrible yellow linoleum.If you are interested with some 'befores', here you go. And here's the progress made thus far: (Although be forgiving, there's light from all angles and it's most challenging for me to get a good shot.) Oh, and I don't think I showed you the table I got for $25.00.  It's perfect for the space.  Pair that with a set of four chairs I got for free from craigslist and painted red, a very reasonable set, indeed.And I moved the other table to the porch.  This table was much too big for the kitchen and fits out here with no problem. Anyway, Back to the kitchen.  I did a little sewing and whipped up this pillow.  It's backed with an old sweater.And the kids like to have their little table right there.

He has lots of animals to tend.  His chickens are his pride and joy.  He gets up and goes outside to do his own 'haying' before breakfast. Sometimes he does round bales, sometimes he does square bales.  He eats his breakfast watching the road outside, waiting for the big John Deere to go by and beep with his load of sweet corn.  There's certain areas I'm not allowed to go or I have to be careful around because there's farming going on there. He hauls cucumbers from the garden with his loader on his John Deere.  He tells me the grooves in the tires help the tractor work hard in tall grass.  He tells me to never touch the exhaust.  He's always doing heavy rock lifting with the John Deere tractor too.  He likes to store his tractors in the barn, where they belong, naturally. Just tonight, he took a break from farming and was having tractor pulls.   He frequently says \"I'm a good farmer, mama.  Everybody's going to say 'That Adri is a good farmer'. \"My 13 month old points out tractors.  She can say \"John Deere\" and \"tractor\".  She's learned all this because she has no choice.  Her big brother has reviewed incessantly.   So, you see, tractors are just something we do around here.  Constantly. It was naptime, and this is what I saw when I went to check on him. I thought about reprimanding him.  But then, how can one sleep when you're very favorite vehicle is outside your bedroom window?  You know, I think he's right.  I think everyone will say \"That Adri is a good farmer.\"  Because, so it seems, he already is."},

Of kids experiencing and becoming comfortable with a realm of animals.  Of kids enjoying simple, homemade treats.  I dreamed of a day that didn't feel rushed, having minimal deadlines and a variety of options. I dreamed of using that day, in part, to help a charity in some way, shape or form.Yesterday was my first shot at giving my kids this little dream I was dreaming.And you know what?  It was exactly what I envisioned. Carloads of kids arrived.  Some with both parents, some with just their mom.  Although many a bit hesitant at first, it wasn't long before our yard was buzzing.  Buzzing with chatter, squeals, ideas and fun. Buzzing with occasional rooster crow and the squabbles from chickens being chased by dozens of kids, along with the tractor haying in the field adjacent.  All stopped to wave when the two passenger trains and the freight train went by.  But then, the chatter continued.  Playing, lots of it.  Parents with their kids, groups of kids sans parents...all finding plenty of entertainment with simple toys.  No electronics.  No batteries.   (Almost) no plastic.  Just basic fun. And some yummy food. Just what I had envisioned. But, the part that I never imagined were the smiles on the moms' and dads' faces.  My first priority was making sure my sweet girl didn't disappear. (A mighty big job).  My second priority I thought would be making sure my big boy was all set.  (He didn't need me.  He was busy making friends.)  So, my revised second priority was trying to chat as much as possible with the friends who stopped by.  My third priority was to not rush the day.  To notice.  Observe.  Appreciate that I have the space, energy and ability to host a crew of 57 adults and children (yes FIFTY SEVEN) in a few hours. When I reminded myself to stop, I noticed big smiles and sparkles in the parents' eyes.  Some of the families who came I know very well, some I know somewhat and some I just met.  Turns out all of the parents seemed to really enjoy watching, playing with and experiencing with their children.  What lucky kids to have such involved parents!  In turn, these families gave most generously to children who have not.    I'm thankful for everyone's contribution for Bags of Love.I must say, that I grossly failed at capturing the day on camera.  Oops.  I did, however, take a few pictures before everyone arrived.  Not the best shots, but memories, nonetheless.  I'm going to post so when this time comes next year, I'll remember what I did. And maybe by posting, one or two of you will see the fun and decide to join us next year.  We'd love to have you! Chickens and Hop the bunny...next year goats too...hopefully! Create!Face painting and paper airplanes.    Play.Tractors and flowers. Tea party and turtles/bowls. Explore.  Experience. Sack races, three legged races, clothes pin drop and bean bag throw.  And the food.  That which I didn't photograph.  I *almost* took a picture when everything but the popcorn was there.  I decided to wait...and then dove in with everyone else before getting a picture  The menu was lemonade, popcorn, watermelon, cucumbers with basil aoili dip, lemon glazed pound cake, chocolate zucchini cake, chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal raisin cookies (recipes for most are in recipe tab above...and I'm told I need to blog the lemon glazed pound cake).

{"title": "Basil.  Lots of it.", "date": null, "text": "Basil, lots of it.  That's what I wanted this year in our garden.  I started it by seeds when it was still winter.  Tended those little seedings.  Now, oh my, we're reaping the benefit.  I ended up planting 7 six packs.  And it's been plenty.  Plenty to eat, share and store.  What I was planning on doing is take pictures of the things we tend to do with basil annually.  But, I just haven't.  I could skip the post until I get all the pictures or write it anyway and update as I get pictures.  I guess I'll go with plan B.Basil...what we do with it. By all means, not an exhaustive list.  Just a start. I sort of am doing this selfishly because I sometimes forget what we tend to do with it when it's coming at us by the bowl full.  Maybe you'll get some ideas...and maybe share some too!1) Pesto.  Lots of it.  Pesto pasta, cous cous, fish, chicken.  It also goes fantastically with spaghetti squash for a grain free option.2) Basil aioli. Which is pretty much a fancy mayo. Chop the basil as fine as possible and mix with mayo.  We often do homemade bread or foccacia, basil aioli, greens, cucumbers and tomatoes.3) Bruschetta.  Baguette, top with tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, balsamic reduction and basil.4) Salad: Next time you are making a salad, add some basil (or whatever herbs you have) right with the greens.  It gives it a good pop.5) Herbed cream cheese.  Chop whatever herbs you have, mix with cream cheese.  Great dip for crackers or  spread for bagels. 6) Roast vegetables with basil and olive oil. 7) Tomato/Cucumber Salad.  Tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, basil and Italian dressing. 8) Corn and Potato Salad:  Corn, red potatoes, basil, cherry tomatoes and Italian dressing. 9) Marinara Sauce10) Pizza: Make a white pizza with olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, basil.  Or a traditional red sauce pizza with basil. 11) Replace Ricotta in Lasagna:  I chop kale or spinach and mix it with basil-about 2 cups.  I add that to sour cream and use it in place of ricotta in lasagna. 12) Fritatta. 13) Soups.14) Toppings for Open Faced Sandwiches Preserving basil.  A) Freezing.  Method 1) Pick stems, chop in food processor and store as pesto/plain basil in glass jars in freezer. 2) Freeze as individual portions in water or oil in ice cube trays.  Once frozen pop into freezer bag. B) Drying (which I have been trying to do more often now that I have no chest freezer).Method1) Pick stems.  Place on cookie sheet that has a cookie sheet underneath.  Preheat oven to 350.  Put in oven for 15 minutes.  Shut oven off.  Once oven is cool, most basil will be dehydrated.  Store in glass jars at room temp.It will taste good come winter.  For now, it's fun to prepare it for storage with my helpers. So tell me, what do you do with your basil."},
{"title": "Not as planned...", "date": null, "text": "There was much I was going to write to you for today.  I took the pictures, was ready to roll. No matter if you have no kids, 1 kid, 2 kids, 10 kids, there's times when things just sort of pile up.  Pile up in not a good way, in a way when you're left feeling overwhelmed, exhausted and unaccomplished.  That's me this week.  A sprained ankle=I can hardly get around + a little girl who gets into things waaay faster than I can move + teething + a little boy sensing things are not normal and behavior follows suit + no one sleeping + a husband who has hardly been around due to schedule differences + a garden that needs attention that I just haven't gotten to (I hope it survives without water-I can't hobble on one foot at water!).  I've been flying solo for much of this week, which is usually fine, but with this sprained ankle, I've been given a run for my money.  It happens to all of us...this feeling scattered.But even in the midst of these crazy days, the few hours I have had my husband here, I am tempted to go get that to do list and get busy.Which I do, some of the time.  And some of the time, I don't.  Sometimes it's so peaceful watching them interact that I don't want to pull myself away. And sometimes, when they're entertained, it's more fun to grab the camera than check that 'To do' list. (I teach them to point and say 'wow'...it baffles me when they actually do.)(Galloping is the best way to get from Point A to Point B for some of us.)My ankle will get better.  My 'To do' list will get done at some point.  What can't wait is watching these kids grow.  The rest of this week, that's what I am going to focus on.  The rest can wait."},
{"title": "Pillowcase Doll (Upcycled)", "date": null, "text": "A friend was asking me advice about simple doll making.  I've made a number of dolls in my day.  The most recent ones I've posted (see creating toys above for references) have been quite intricate.  Although possible for a beginner, intricate doll making is really a challenging first project.Enter memory lane.  I used to mass produce these as a little girl.  I had a singer purple kid sewing machine.  All it did was a straight stitch and a zig zag.  Perfect for whipping these up by the dozens.  I think every friend I had received one from me.  Ahh, memories. So, if you are in the market to learn to sew and want a doll, here's a project for you.  Or if you know of a little child who wants to learn how to sew, here is a project for you.  Or if you would like to upcycle one of your child's special flannel receiving blankets, here's a project for you.  Or if you aren't a seamstress but still want to give a little homemade...this is also a project for you.Supplies:-Two rectangles of fabric.  I used flannel receiving blankets, but you could use any fabric you have. Pillowcases work too, especially if you wanted a new sew option. You can pretty much make the rectangles of fabric any size you want, it's however big you want your doll.  I used 13 inches/16 inches.-Polyfill or the insides of an old stuffed animal/pillow.-Lace (no more than a yard)-Thread-Glue gun-Ribbon 1) Cut your rectangles. These are 13x16.  Or if you have a pillowcase already sewed, skip this step. 2) Attach the lace to the bottom edge of each piece of fabric or the bottom edge of the pillowcase.* Note, if the bottom seam of the fabric is already finished or the selvage edge, you can glue or sew the lace right to the edge.  If it's not finished, you might choose to fold the bottom edge over/stitch, zig zag the edge or using pinking shears so it doesn't unravel.3) Place right sides of fabric together, laced edges touching.  Stitch and finish the seams of the left, top and right sides.  Leave laced edge unstitched.  Turn right side out, press.  It should look like a pillowcase. 3) Take a small ball of stuffing and put it in the top of the pillowcase.  Tie ribbon around that ball of stuffing tight to make a head.  Make sure you leave the points untied so they can be the arms.  4) Add some stuffing to each point.  Tie ribbon around to make arms.*Note-make sure ribbons are stitched in place and are short in length so it's safe for little ones to play with.  5) Cut piece of lace the right length to make bonnet. Stitch or glue bonnet in place.  This is what it should look like. I gave it to my sweet girl.  She usually isn't into dolls.  She prefers tractors.  Or anything that isn't supposed to be a toy. She appeared to like it.  Gave it a hug when prompted.  But... It wasn't long until she started shaking the life out of the poor doll. Ah, oh well.  If you make one, I'd love to see your results!"},

I certainly have enough of them to display. But...what I was really thinking was the other one I have.  A pair of quilt racks and a sheet (the vitage one here I got for fifty cents!)=canopy tent. I set one up and it's perfect. Perfect because I'd want to play in there if I was a kid.  Perfect to slow down these little bodies who have been getting so much exercise running around in the sunshine.  A perfect place for memories to be made. I filled it with books.  Didn't take long for two to climb in.It lasted even longer than I expected...this quiet play.  Bodies were calmed down temporarily, but the giggles started up again.  It's down now, but it comes out periodically. It's a perfect stow away type of item, as it just looks like a quilt rack when it's not their canopy tent.  I set it up on those days when I can sense my littles need a bit more rest.  They may find it on the porch, in the play room, in the guest room, in the living room.  It may be filled with books, puzzles, bead stringing, coloring supplies.  No matter where it is, where it's set up or what's in it...when they discover it, they can't help but to climb in, relax and enjoy."},

Oh goodness, how much changes in month, right before our very own eyes.This was June: And a drum roll for July: This is the first year having a garden in this very space.  It's the same location a garden fed a family of 7 for over 100 years. Sitting vacant for some time, this is the first year it's been put back to work.  As it is always so with gardening, although there is celebration, there always seems to be a little disappointment here and there.  Unfortunately, when the septic was repaired here, the soil from that project was deposited in the very spot of above garden.  The top few inches is really, really poor soil that does not hold water at all.  However, that which is underneath has years of nutrients.  Next year we need to improve the soil. There's also big and small critters, bugs, unpredictable weather, big humans with rototillers and little humans with fast feet and grabby hands... Sometimes not everything makes it. But what has been making it is plenty for us right now.  And to think I started just about everything from seed!  Plenty for us, some for sharing.  Not a lot for winter storage as of yet, but that is a blessing, indeed, given we just lost our chest freezer. We are thankful that we don't need the grocery store as frequent as usual. Anyway, every meal is centered around the garden.  Kale, swiss chard, carrots, lettuce, basil, oregano, parsley, different squashes, green onions, garlic, peas, beans, cauliflower, broccoli, tomatoes, cucumbers, soon to be corn, peppers, cabbage, potatoes and eggplant.  I'm sure I'm forgetting some.  All that into salads, fried rice, stir fry, quiche, pasta sauces, pizzas, pesto and so on and so forth.  My kids gobble up that which we've grown. We are most happy eating freshly picked in our backyard. I have some blogger friends who were posting some blossoms around their garden.  (That's you Little Acre that Could).  Inspired me to look around my own garden.  These were taken at dusk with my 2 helpers.  Not perfect, but I hope you enjoy.

{"title": "Happy Birthday Banner (Free Pattern)", "date": null, "text": "When we were first married, I had this cardboard birthday banner that I used to string across the kitchen for my husband's birthday.  He commented each time I did it how neat it was to have the kitchen decorated for him. That cardboard one is long gone.It was my goal to have a fabric birthday banner made before my son's first birthday. Didn't happen. Make that his second birthday. Umm...didn't happen again. Oh well.  It's done now. Fabric scraps is what I used.  A bit of it is upcycled.  I used the ribbons from my brother's plethora of racing medals.  Believe me, he won't notice they're missing.  Makes it a little bit more special having a little sentimental meaning.  Anyway, there's instructions/pattern below so you can make one out of paper, felt or fabric.I made it red, white and blue not only for our little firecracker's birthday, but so I can turn it around and just use the red, white and blue for other patriotic holidays. Besides being a bit mixed up from blowing in the wind, I think it was just the little bit of jazz needed for a special someone's first birthday.Templates for the Happy Birthday Banner found here: Directions to make three ways:A) Out of Paper.  Cut triangles.  Cut letters.  Affix letters to triangles with glue/double sided tape.  Hang from ribbon/rope via clothespins/tape.B) Out of Felt:  Cut triangles.  Cut letters. Affix letters to triangles using hot glue gun, new sew heat n bond or stitching.  Overlap top corner edges on each successive triangle by 1- 1 1/2 inches, pinning in place(see close up photo above for reference). Stitch 1/4 inch from edge.  Stitch ribbon to end of banner to hang.C) Out of fabric:  Cut 2 triangles. Cut letters.  Applique letters to each triangle using no sew heat n bond/double sided interfacing and zig zag stitching.  Notch corners.  Place two triangles together, right sides together.  Stitch along edges, leaving a 3 inch gap on top. Turn inside out and press.  Hand stitch the top closed. Overlap top corner edges on each successive triangle by 1- 1 1/2 inches, pinning in place (see close up photo above for reference). Stitch 1/4 inch from edge.  Stitch ribbon to end of banner to hang."},

Well, Audra Grace, you are our little firecracker indeed.You started your first steps at 11 months, and have not stopped walking/practically running since.We know you're about to get into trouble, as you'll warn us with a 'n-n-n-no' or an 'uhoh'.  Not like that will stop you from completing whatever naughty thing you decide you must do.If you feel like we're forgetting you, you'll holler \"AUDRA\" over and over.  You never want to miss out.You're starting to enjoy books, pointing to pictures when mama asks and such.  You love the Ladybug book the best.  And any touch and feel books sets you into a fit of giggles.  You're super good at in and out.  And you enjoy playing that game with everything.  Especially the just folded laundry.  You call people on your pretend phones.  You make big messes, which really annoys your brother. Although you enjoy greeting the chickens with a 'hi', pulling the cats tails and the petting the bunny yields more giggles, the pet you love the best is hands down our dog.  You will leave anything you're doing to pet that dog.  All other pets, you're not so gentle.  But your Kammie, you're most gentle with her.Because your mom is a speech therapist, I must keep track of the words you know.  Odd, perhaps, but I can't help myself.  Words: mama, dada, hi, bye, mmm (for eating), Audra, a word for potty, Kam, ball, kitty, chicken, thank you, 'n-n-n-no', uhoh, and the best siren out there (thank you big brother).  Sign:  more, plane, hat, train, milk, flower.  You're getting really good at following simple directions (sit down, give to me, come here, find your belly, give me a kiss, Where's Adri? etc). You do the motions with the songs \"Open shut them\", \"Happy and You Know It\" and a couple others that require clapping. You sit very well for library story hour.Your favorite foods are applesauce, pearsauce, yogurt and bread with jam.  Coincidentally that's the stuff your mama canned/made homemade for you.  You know the way to your mama's heart!Although the first month was great, by month two you decided you weren't a fan of sleeping.  You're still not a fan of sleeping.You enjoy hanging out on mama's back. You give the best (sloppiest?) kisses out there.  You pat our back when you give us a hug. You love mama and dada equally and will give other people hugs and snuggles.We both love you so incredibly much.  You've been the perfect addition to our family.  Did I mention I love you so?  Happy first birthday, sweet girl.  May we have an amazing year of adventures ahead of us."},

We're packing up, yes, but I'm also thankful that we're leaving this farm and all the gardens with capable hands. I admit, once my husband isn't around to help, it's been a bit of a disaster packing.  Both kids want to be attached to me.  With one on front, the other on back, I have 50 pounds of kid on me.  It's virtually impossible to do anything. I tell myself that it's okay if I forget something, as there's stores where we're going.  But still...this to do list...My awesome husband told me to not worry about food, we'll just pick some stuff up on the way.  I stumbled my way through packing an actually got a little done by sticking my kids in front of youtube.  I don't think I've done that since we were packing to move here. It lasted all of 10 minutes. They're so not used to TV, which isn't a bad thing, really.  Except when you want them to stay put. As I tried the not so successful balance of packing and managing the littles, all I wanted was our balance back.  Usually I don't feel so scattered and I'm much more in sync with them.I left my packing.  We made cookies. We got our chickens out.  I brought them to the garden and we filled this. We played with our dog.I froze some garlic scrapes and some basil. We made bread.  I read them books. In the moment, I wasn't get my list done.  But, after we got our balance back, stuff did get done.There were a few sad goodbyes to some chickens when he realized they can't come with.And some excitement of what to come with those who are going (seriously, we could never leave this dog here....she loves camp!)And our plan to pick up whatever on the way was replaced with lots of mama mades: oatmeal raisin cookies, bread with strawberry rhubarb jam and a garden fresh salad, home canned applesauce and hard boiled eggs from our own chickens. (Recipes on tab above.)Yes, going new places, eating new things, branching out is quite good.  But, there's also something to be said for familiar loves too.  Anyway, I'm off to enjoy these fabulous folks.  I will miss our home, our garden and our animals.  But our farm caretakers will be arriving to enjoy the farm and the beaches here, so I have nothing to worry about.And if you're a northern NYer, come for a playdate and picnic with us on Tuesday July 2nd around 9:30/10 at Lisbon beach.There will continue to be posts throughout the duration of our vacation, but my facebook appearances will be few.Have yourselves a wonderful week!"},

Encouraging to see-things ARE growing.  Good good.You know, this gardening thing is always a mix of emotions for me.  This certainly is not my first time gardening, I have years of experience under my belt.  But what I forget is that this is my *first* time gardening this plot of land.  There's so much to be learned-soil composition, water collection areas, weed control...just how this piece of land works.  I want everything to be big and bountiful and sometimes can be a little frustrated when things don't go perfectly.  There's lacking seeds-all of one kind of bean grew, but none of the other (not sure if it's green or yellow that's growing-must label next year!).  One seed packet isn't growing at all, and I think it's zucchini (although again, I didn't label at all).  I think my corn washed away, very sparse.  Deer have been enjoying cabbage and cauliflower.  We had company during that hot spell and I didn't get out to water the broccoli as much as I should have and it looks quite sad. The potatoes hate the soil and are doing a whole lot of nothing.  Little feet have stepped where they don't belong and there's been some trampling by the bigger feet in this house as well.  Sometimes I feel a little defeated.  But, you know....no matter how experienced you are as a gardener, there's always something that doesn't make it.  I am giving myself permission to relax a little-this is the first time we've gardened here...there's bound to be some mishaps.  It's also not that we're depending on this food to survive-we do have access to a grocery store.  And garden keeping isn't work, it's fun for us.  There's no time wasted when it's spent together with family getting dirty.Okay, so if you made it through all that...you'd think my garden looked pretty pathetic.  But you know what? When I look at what is growing, there's quite a lot.  And it actually is quite fantastic.  Yes, there's been some loss...but most of it is thriving!!!  The apple trees, blueberry bushes and grapevines all have new leaves.  The strawberries are producing.  Tomatoes, carrots, garlic, swisschard, peas, spinach, pumpkin, squash, cucumbers, peppers, eggplant, kale, herbs, onions-and I could go on and on.  I've used oodles of rhubarb and it's still coming. If you were to come and look at this garden, you would not even know that we lost anything.  It really is turning out quite well.Peas are growing. Carrots need thinning.Some of the broccoli is coming along. We have been eating lots of green onions-my son picks and eats them while he's in the garden. I have no idea what this is.  I am a failure at labeling. The raspberry harvest will happen next year. Fresh basil...mmm.It's hard to believe I grew this from seed.The deer haven't eaten all the cauliflower.Grapevines starting to settle into their new 'home'. Strawberry Love There's new flowers blooming on a regular basis here.  Sooo fun!!!  It's my real live secret garden.   And I didn't tell you about this yet, did I?  A ginormous overgrown perennial garden.  I cleared it out (HUGE job) and I'm hoping to get it back in check.  Perhaps make a little kid tea party zone?  Hmmm...  Not that I don't have enough to do with all this....Anyway, fact of the matter is, the gardens here aren't a 100% success, but I'd say 90% of what I've been up to is thriving indeed.The goal really is to eat fresh through the summer months, having a little to preserve if possible.  I think we're getting there.For the third time, I've filled up my antique strainer with my bounty, came inside and made dinner.  (In case you're wondering-two types of kale, swisschard, green onions, baby spinach and basil.)Add all that to a pizza with pineapple and sun dried tomatoes-even my kids gobble it up.  Can't beat that.

In between the weeds, there's much growing.  Celebration!When sweet girl took a nap, my little guy did his rice bin and I primed the kitchen. We chattered away.  The kitchen looks soooo much better already and we enjoyed our time.When she woke up, we played trains until lunch.A lunch of leftovers together, followed by a sweet and tangy strawberry rhubarb cupcake. Yum.  Two helpers helped me clean up. More books.  I love reading books with them so.  And then both for an afternoon nap.  At the same time.  (Doesn't happen everyday).And I got to work cleaning the barn, bagging whatever garbage I found and dreaming of what it will look like all fixed up.And then they were still napping.  We were just going to have sandwiches for dinner, but a quick walk to the freezer, pantry, coop and garden whipped up a gorgeous dinner of kibbeh, and broccoli casserole topped with homemade stuffing from my homemade bread.  Mmm.A yummy dinner with the kids and then a long walk with them-to visit the neighborhood cows and horses.    Okay, if you read all that, it's really not a big deal. It's mundane, everyday, ordinary things.  But it's just how I want many of my kids' days to be filled.  Here, on this farm.  Enjoying simple things and spending time with their mama.  The only way I'd make it better is if daddy could be here too.I'm thankful, very thankful, for today and pray there will be many more similar days."},

{"title": "Our Screen Porch", "date": null, "text": "Have you been dying to know how I've been spending my last week?  Okay, maybe not dying to know, but perhaps interested?  I have been working very very hard on our porch.  I posted a little about our porch here. It is a fabulous porch.  Warm in the winter and screened in for the summer.  South facing, so a greenhouse to start plants.  Only it needed a little love.  There's been three changes.  I'll start with the before pictures, leaving you full of suspense for the after shots. 1) The windows, door and bottom panels all came out, so there's floor to ceiling screens now.  My husband and dad did this part.  The widows will go back in come fall for the winter.2) I painted. It's hard to tell in pictures, but I think you can see where I painted and where I didn't here.  It was very dingy, dirty, cracked, yuck.  I worried about lead paint too.  A fresh coat is just what it needed. 3) The carpet was gross. Stained all over the place, grimy and gross. I'm not sure how many years it's been there...probably longer than I've been alive.  I didn't like sweet girl crawling on it, but I was scared to rip it up without having another rug on deck.  I didn't know what the floor would look like under there.  Given we still have two mortgages (other house hasn't sold yet...thoughts and prayers on that front would be appreciated), we cannot afford a new carpet.  Just like that, after talking about wanting a different rug, a friend posted she was selling a huge braided rug -12ft x 8ft.  She gave it to us for pennies compared to the original cost and we're sooo thankful.  Seriously, after she promised we could have it, I wasted no time, I started ripping that carpet minutes after. Here's the before. And now, drum roll please...this was a ton of work...Here's our new sun porch!!!! And what's cool is every.single.thing. pictured in this room is second hand/thrifted/found on the side of the road or a garage sale. Craigslist rocker.  Thrift store bead maze.  Free chair from friends.  Free patio set found on the side of the road with cushions/pillows handmade.  Rugs from friends. Craigslist rockers.  Handmade toys. Even thrifted sap buckets holding my geraniums on the porch. I love a medley of things that don't really belong together merging into perfect harmony.   This whole hedge is lilacs.What's a relieve is the floor isn't too bad.  Of course after a ton of cleaning.It's worn in, not perfect, but good enough for now.  And how about our new rug?!  And  what's grand is you spin around and there's still room enough on this porch for our dining area.  We didn't eat out here before.  Not with an 11 month old throwing items on the carpet repetitvely.  Now we have the hard woodfloor, we're out there for every meal. And here's some homemades: punched pie plate tins by me, punched framed copper art by me (barnboard frame by the BOG), basket by my mother in law, quilt by me, bottles found by the BOG scuba diving.  But, what makes this porch fantastic is the childhood memories in the making.  It was actually this sunporch that I used to run by daily, dreaming of what it would be like to have children running around on it.  Dreams do come true... I likely will paint the floor.  And I ought to do the ceilings at some point. But for now, it's our peaceful, restful respite. It's perfect for memory making. And there's no other place I'd rather serve father's day breakfast, that's for sure. Thanks for stopping by!"},

This husband of mine...he may leave all of his dishes out for me to put away.  He may step over something for months instead of picking it up. It may take him a couple weeks to get around to do a two minute task. He may be a tad of a procrastinator in some ways, but never about being a father.  He's the first one there to help out if they need him.  He teaches them, reads to them, enjoys them.  He adjusted to having 2 under the age of 2 with great ease...he is their sole caretaker 3 days a week.  He brings them on outings by himself-always to library story hour and sometimes the beach, hikes or snowshoeing.  He is a natural at positive parenting and is a great problem solver if something isn't working. He's a great role model. The choices he makes are all based on what's important to him-his kids.  I'm pretty proud to have this awesome guy not only as my husband, but my children's father.  We're all pretty lucky to have him around.And in case you miss the last two Father's Day celebrations, here you go: 20122011And on to the highlights from this last year.

The slower rhythm that begins my day, chatting with children at my feet as I clip on the clothes one by one. The necessity of being outside at the end of the day to take the clothes off, again with children at my feet.The smell of line dried clothes.  Especially sheets.The brighter napkins, clothes and diapers as the sun bleaches them. Just being outside and enjoying the weather. The cheaper electric bill.  Hey, who doesn't love a bargain?Many, many thanks to my dad for putting this up for me.  I had been asking and begging, and he listened.   I don't remember who told me, but someone told me that the folks who lived here before had a clothesline that attached the woodshed to the barn.  Surely, that wouldn't be big enough for me, as it only holds one load at a time, so I thought.  But it was at least a start. What do I know? It's so windy there, I can do 3-4 loads a day and they dry in no time.  In the first 48 hours, I did 8 loads of laundry.I know, I know, it's really pathetic I get excited about a clothes line.  I mean it's laundry for pete's sake.  Who gets excited about laundry?  Me, apparently.My dad is an upcyclier like me (is that I word?).  I couldn't reach the clothesline to start hanging the clothes.  He used an old broom we found in the barn and hammered in/bent a nail so I can hook the line to pull it down.  Brilliant! And remember this, what I upcycled?  A clothespin holder from a dishtowel and a hanger.  (Find that post here)Anyway, I think every kid needs to have fun running in/out/around/under sheets on a clothesline.Perhaps you agree?"},

Simmer 3 minutes, covered.2) In separate bowl, combine 1/4 cup sugar with sure jell.3) Add peaches or strawberries to sauce pan, add sugar/sure jell combo.  Bring to rolling boil that doesn't stop, stirring constantly.4) Add rest of sugar.  Boil 1 more minute, stirring constantly.5) I did a little spin with the immersion blender or you can use a masher so there's not too many chunks.5) Add to jars immediately.  6) You can either can or freeze. If you freeze, leave a good inch of head space so the jars don't crack, wait until room temp and pop in the freezer. If you're canning, prep the jars/lids, pack and close as you normally would in the canning world, process in water bath canner for 10 minutes."},

{"title": "The transition...", "date": null, "text": "Within this last week, we went from wearing some spring gear...  to needing full out 100% summer gear only.   At least most of us did.  This kid, he wants to wear two shirts: long sleeved and short sleeved, jeans, socks, his BOG boots and a chicken.  Everyday.  Even if it's 95 degrees, clear skies, no wind, with 100% humidity.  Thankfully, sweet girl will wear whatever we put on her. Anyway, I usually try not to make a big deal about little things, but seriously, it's not okay to be dressed for winter all summer long.  Nor does it make any sense to be under your down comforter in the hottest room in the house.  Who wants to be hotter than necessary? I do not want to hospitalize anyone for overheating.This kid does not like change at all...like his mama much?!   (Although he transitioned into living at this place with no problem...must have farmhouse love like his mama.)So, we came up with a plan.  That really is a silly plan if you ask the rest of us. But not to him, not to him at all.  Makes perfect sense. We compromised.  From now on, he'll wear summer type clothes, provided I let him pack his winter clothes in a bag for him to tote along if he needs it.In the playroom, outside playing trucks, out to the coop...he totes his bag of winter clothes. Yes, we went to the grocery store, everyone was dripping sweat in the parking lot.  But in the shopping cart is his bag of two shirts, jeans, socks and boots (sans chicken, thankfully).  To church, to the library, to a walk to the horse barn, we have our winter gear.  While he sleeps, there's footed pajamas, wool socks and an undershirt next to his bed.  \"In case I need it, mama\". I guess you can never be too prepared.  Weather does change without warning in Maine, that's for sure.  Best to be ready.I hope dressing this girl will be a bit simpler.  So far, she doesn't complain how mama likes her to wear dresses daily.  Hey, might as well get away with it while she lets me."},

Because I'm sooo excited. It's coming together and I am finally done planting.  Believe it or not, I planted it ALL.  By myself when little ones were napping, sometimes.  Or sometimes with a kid on my back. Or sometimes with a kid who I am trying sooo very hard to make sure he doesn't stomp on my efforts by accident.  Or with a kid on my back and one following me.   I can't believe I did it.  Especially since this garden is much bigger than I intended it to be. What you see here below is one of three plots.  This is the by far the largest where the majority of the food is planted.  This week, I got the stakes up, as you can see.  The tomato cages are all in.  28 Big Boy tomatoes started from seed and I did buy 2 cherry tomatoes from our local farm store. My husband helped me put up some fenceposts and chickenwire, both of which I found in the barn for the peas.  Not fancy, but it I think it is not only functional, but also adds character. I also transplanted concord grapes. to the trellis. There's tons around here, I know because the kind woman who lived here let me take grape leaves to make grape rolls and grapes to make jam (Which I just read that I processed 40 pounds of grapes myself in 2011 to make 65 jars of jam!!!  We're still eating it now, last year's grapes weren't as abundant.  I am crazy, yes, I know.)  I've been reading about how to tend them to perhaps make a vineyard...just brainstorming and thinking.   And that which I cannot believe I finished is the raspberries.  Big hierloom raspberries from my neighbors.  They said I could take all I want.  I did.  I transplanted 67 and made a large hedge on the open edge of our garden.  More things are sprouting and growing in this main garden area.  That which I did not talk about last week are these: From top to bottom/left to right. There's celery at the top. (I rooted the bottom of a couple from the store and it's growing, so I decided to try to see if I could plant them).  Swiss chard. Sunflowers.  Marigolds at the edge of each row.  Carrots.  Spinach, which my Adrian has already sampled and said MMM!, and Parsley.  All this stuff is from seed.  I hope the parsley takes off in particular, as it will be awesome to have tabouleh all summer.  I think I planted 12 of them?  Hopeful thinking!We have had a lot of rain in the last week and not much sun.  But, from last week, the tomatoes are indeed growing.  I need to do a little thinning of the kale. There's a whole row like this! The basil is in.  Hope to have an awesome crop if he stops running through it.I also added regular and red potatoes. Oh, and I had one row left and nothing to plant. I was going to leave it blank, but then saw cauliflower at the bulk food store.  Bought that.  And then I went back in to pay for cabbage and bought that too.  Never planted cabbage before, thought I'd give it a whirl. So, onto the other garden.  To the left of this one:  There is this patch.  Which houses blueberries, strawberries, corn, beans and pumpkins.  Someday I want it to be exclusively strawberries and blueberries.   Remember how I didn't think the blueberries were going to survive?  Well, I'm pleased to say that each one has some new growth.  Wahoo!And the last new garden actually has a funny story.  I was set on having a cut flower garden.  My husband was at work, kids sleeping.  I thought I'd rototill it myself.  I have no business rototilling.  I can't move the darn thing.  So, the ground was wet enough for me to dig this up by hand with the 'soil turning' garden tool I have.  It was actually fun, as I found a ton of worms doing it by hand.  All sorts of cut flowers are planted here, not sure what will come. Onto the perennial flowers...These flower beds haven't had any attention in years.  I need to get to it.  There have been some fun surprises.Out front, for some reason, there's a big chunk of house that only had lily of the valleys.  I love them, but wanted to add a little more pop.  I transplanted various types of hostas, astilbes, bleeding hearts, a jacob's ladder and something else that I never remember the name for.  Looks small now, but once it expands, it should look a little better.Such as this whole chunk of the field that is thick with daisies.  That makes me happy.And some other perennials are coming up.PhyloxMountain bluet. Loads of irises, can't wait to see the colors! Oh my, have you made it through all that?  So that's the long winded version of what I've been up to this week in the gardens.  In case you haven't had enough, here's the reports from:Week 1Week 2 What have you been growing?"},

Only there was a major problem.  Sweet girl was sleeping in the car.  He couldn't go in with me.  I was all alone...well, except my sweet little boy on my back. It was an estate sale...you could wander through the barn, house and workshop, choosing what you like best to get a price quoted by the sellers.  It's sort of odd, walking through a house and sifting through stuff that was someone's who just passed away.  But that's besides the point.  I went room to room in this 1800s house.  Oh my, the stuff!  I don't think previous habitats got rid of anything!  Lots of old stuff/antiques.Plus the old house was fun just to see.Onto the haggling story.  Because, you know...*I* haggled.  And I'm sure you're dying to hear the story.Well, I made my selection.  I went for a quote.  $45 they said.  (Insert beating heart, sweaty palms and quivery voice.)  I busted out my cash and said \"All I have is $23.\"  And then I waited.  (You see, that's the hard part about haggling.  Typical me would ask for a deal and then talk them right out of giving me a deal.  Best to be silent and pray in my head that they aren't going to turn crazy on me.)  They said 'Well, the cost is $45\".  I repeat \"All I have is $23\".  (Which totally wasn't a lie...that is all I had).  They said I could make out a check.  I told them I didn't have my checkbook. (Which was also totally true).  Believe it or not, I just waited. But they weren't budging.  (Oh goodness....I hope they're not planning on how they're going ballistic on me is what I was thinking.)  I am not sure if they heard my heartbeat...but it was thumping louder than a frat boy's boom box.

I almost did a cartwheel.  Until I remembered 1) I had a 2 1/2 year old strapped to my back, 2) That wouldn't be classy and 3) I can't even do a cartwheel.But I did it, I got a deal.  Woot woot!  And I can't believe you read all that.

But the major question is...what do I like better?  A deal?  My awesome finds?  Or that which is on my new find in the plate below? I'll probably still freak next time I try to haggle...but at least I have one success.  Tell me, how good are you at haggling?"},
{"title": "Sweet Tidbits", "date": null, "text": "Three recent tidbits from an important 2 1/2 year old. 1) It's a dream come true when there's any type of construction vehicle that passes his house.  If they stop and do work in front of the house, nothing else can be done that day. When they cut the engine for a break, a certain 2 1/2 year old might panic that the truck has broken down. No worries, he'll come up with a solution. He may retrieve his wooden tow truck and interrupt the workers with an \"Excuse me, you need a tow truck?  I got one!\"  2) For the one chicken who always hides/gets stuck and we have to find, this 2 1/2 year old will become very, very serious about finding her.  He will definitely help.  \"I'm a good farmer, mama. Adri's a really really good farmer?\" Said chicken will likely get some 1:1 attention thenafter.  Perhaps a firetruck ride?  A ride in a John Deere tractor?  Maybe just being lugged around. A very serious little guy will say:  \"I take good care of my chickens, mama.\" 3) If you need anything at all organized, this 2 1/2 year old will organize his way.  None of the blocks pictured below have been dumped.  Each has been carefully selected and organized in this manner.  \"It's a building, mama.  A very good one for tractors.\"This bit of randomness makes me smile. Hopefully you too."},

{"title": "Gardening: Take 2. ", "date": null, "text": "Won't you join me in my gardening journey?  I talked about getting started last week here. Sooo much progress has been made in the last week.I have never planted so much this early.  I usually wait for the Memorial Day rule to start with the non cold hearty stuff.  However, I checked our forecast for frost.  None, nada, zip.  No frost for 10 days.  In the clear?  I think so.So, I sort of went crazy.  Well, to those who know me, they'd just say it's another day in Jackie's life.  But really, even by my standards, I went crazy.  I planted all of this by myself or with 2 kids in tow.  Just sayin', I'm mighty proud of myself.Now that it's almost all planted, watching it grow is the very best part.   Okay, so what's in?  Up there is sugar pumpkins.  I planted them far away from everything else to prevent cross pollination. I only plant sugar pumpkins, as they're the type that are best for eating.  Sure, we may carve a couple, but the rest I puree and freeze.  I planted a bunch.  If we're lucky, we just may have a pick your own pumpkin party in the fall.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Okay, so what else is there?  From Top left, clockwise: Butternut Squash and spaghetti squash are coming. Spaghetti squash is a great alternative to pasta. Kale...lots of kale.  Hoping to use it for smoothies or to dehydrate and throw in soups.  12 eggplants that I started from seed and transplanted.  30 pepper plants that I also started from seed and transplanted.  We haven't had a lot of luck with peppers here, but I talked to the local farmer from the farm stand and he gave me some fertilizing hints. Strawberries are coming-our friends mentioned that to get best production you shouldn't pick the first year.  We're ignoring that rule and going to eat them anyway.  Broccoli-30 plants I started from seed are in right now.  I cannot believe how big they are.  Broccoli is so easy to cut, blanch and freeze. Garlic-we'll likely eat the scrapes soon (and the lilacs are beautiful in the background).  And peas in the middle.  Also, we have some  sunflowers, spinach, carrots and swiss chard up (not pictured). And tomatoes...that I started from seed. They're really quite big!  I planted 28 plants. I wasn't going to do onions, but then I decided to last minute.  I planted 170 bulbs.  How's that for thinking I wasn't going to do any?!In case you're following-we still haven't located the patch of asparagus on this property. But the blueberries that I thought weren't taking are looking better.I still need to plant all those flats of basil I started from seed.  And parsley.  Plus some flowers I have started inside.  I also am going to do heirloom raspberries, maybe tomorrow?  And I want my husband to till up an area to grow some annual cut flowers. I've planted and am waiting on summer squash, zucchini, cucumbers,corn, green and yellow beans, potatoes and the onions. Plus rosemary, oregano and cilantro. One of my all time summer faves is herbed cream cheese-my husband chops a bunch of herbs and mixes it with cream cheese. Spread that on your morning bagel-mmm! We have a plethora of chives.  Which is good, as our free ranged chickens at them all at our other house. Baked potato with fresh chives?  Yes, please.  We have rhubarb a plenty-6 plants.  Wow! It looks like not much now, but in the ground, there's lots growing-or so I hope.  It will be fun to see what it will be in a few weeks. We had a little grown up playdate this week. I got together with a friend and we chopped rhubarb and strawberries to freeze for 8 different crisps/pies. Fun times! The wildflowers are fun to find.  Here's some violets.  And bluets.  And do you see we'll have a good chuck of our field that will be all daises?!  SQUEE! And a whole hedge of lilacs, on each side of our house.  Imagine how our yard smells now. There's this beautiful rock garden in front of our house.  I've spent about 4 hours cleaning it out thus far and only are about 1/2 way done.  It's coming though. It's all coming together, really.  My dad reminds me that it will take years to get this farmhouse back to what it was.  There's a lot of progress that's been made already.  For that, I'm grateful."},

There's sandals, sweaters, flowers, togetherness.  We're usually eating dinner outside and we find ourselves lingering just a bit longer after we've cleaned up our meal.  Sprinting through open fields, checking on the gardens, willing the sun to set just a little slower.   And if we're lucky, we catch the train.

I'm waiting (sort of) patiently for the last danger of frost to pass to keep planting.(Can you spy the chicken in the Tonka truck?!).We put in 4 blueberry bushes that aren't taking so well. I think it was in the packaging, the root separated very easily from the soil when it came out of the package.  They may or may not make it.  But, we did put in 10 strawberry plants that are doing super well.  Close by, there's oodles of berries in the grass adjacent to where they used to have the edge of their garden.  The leaves look slightly larger than the typical wild strawberry plant, but time will tell.  This will be our berry patch. Heirloom raspberries will be next. We also planted four apple trees over to the side, which wasn't done at the time of this photo. Jonathan, Cortland, McIntosh and Fuji.  I hope they take, we've been watering them.  I also have squealed with excitement, well, 6 times. Yes, you can hardly walk through this field with all the brush...but do you spy what I spy?!  Mature apple trees!!!  I've counted six around the property, squealing each time I find another.  I wonder what fruit they will produce?  There's supposedly an asparagus patch somewhere....haven't found it yet, but I keep looking.On to inside...seedlings.  Most all flats I've started and a couple I've bought. Lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, basil, parsley, broccoli, kale...and I'm sure there's more.  Plus some marigolds and some morning glories, just for fun.  I cannot believe how our screen porch has served as a pseudo greenhouse.  This picture was from last week, they're an inch taller now!  Very exciting, indeed.  Now, if I actually plant and harvest all that I started, I will have a plethora for preserving.  Fingers crossed.These turkeys need to stay away. They keep coming around these parts, sometimes in a full strut, thinking they own this joint.   Anyway, lawnmowing is a fun time for a certain little guy.  He's been doing much exploring.  He loves worms and bugs, just like his mama.

We also had a large pizza making gathering with dear friends, paired with Frisbee throwing, water balloons, nature walks and train sightings.  37 people (that's thirty seven...wow!) have marched on our lawn and through our house yesterday, yes.But that which makes smile the widest are these pictures here.  Farmer Rick came to work our land.  He has a John Deere. Adrian loves, loves, loves him.  He got to climb on his John Deere a year ago and he still talks about it.  Just this last Thursday, this was the conversation with a random man in the grocery store:Random man:  \"Nice hat.\"Adrian:  \"It's a John Deere. I have a John Deere at home.  Farmer Rick drives a big John Deere tractor. I love John Deere... \"Random man didn't know the can of worms he was opening when complimenting a John Deere.Anyway, want to know how fast a two and a HALF year old can wake from a nap, sprint through the house searching for his John Deere apparel and his farm boots?  Let me tell you, fast.  It's important, you see. And we will hear about this Farmer Rick/John Deere sighting for the next year, at least.  Farmer Rick is such a celebrity.  Adrian wrote him a letter tonight that reads:\"To Farmer Rick, I love your John Deere, Farmer Rick.I love your fertilizer.I love you, Farmer Rick.Love, Adrian\"Anyway, these photos make me smile.  Of course, Farmer Rick needed to see one of Adrian's John Deere.  Do you think we have a future farmer living here?!"},

{"title": "Continuing traditions...", "date": null, "text": "Wood stacking.  I've done a lot of it in my time.  I grew up in a farmhouse...and we heated with wood.  We moved to a log cabin in the woods...and we heated and cooked/baked with wood. My husband and I moved to our first house and installed a fireplace insert.  We moved to our second house (and forever home!) and installed a fireplace insert.  I know I'm a broken record here, but I love love love the smell, the warmth, the ambiance of wood fires. As a kid, I loathed stacking wood.  Sweaty, dirty, pinched fingers, sore body, ugh.  (Stop reading here if you're my dad...)  Truth be told, I didn't really hate it as much as I said.  I just liked complaining about it. I used to think I was roped into doing work...I now realize that I probably wasn't too helpful.  Stacking wood was about together time, less about the job getting done. It was probably the longest time I ever had my dad captive as I chattered on endlessly. (And no, that's not an exaggeration...I always followed him, talking at him.) My brother and I busied ourselves, finding the smaller pieces and the perfect place to stack them. Working together to get a job done, with a promise of some baked trip to reward our efforts when we were done. It was actually...kind of....fun.  Now that we need wood, it's that type of togetherness that's coming to this farmhouse. Adrian is very serious about his job. And I hope you enjoy the pictures nearly as much as we enjoy this time together.   (Oh, and PS...I never told you about this fab woodshed attached to the house.  There's a peek-a-boo closet that opens from the shed to the kitchen for stacking wood.  I should have taken pics to show you.  On the to do list...  But...here is the secret door to the hidden room.  We found a whole box of newspapers up there that are over 100 years old!) And...enjoying the end result."},

Thankfully, they have no clue how their mama stresses. But, we're here, living in the home of my dreams, and it's almost been 6 months. We made it through the most expensive heating season of my life.   We still own two homes, which I cannot think about, as I worry myself sick.  There's other things that I worry about on a regular basis...which really serves no purpose.  I know that things will work out the way they are supposed to work out.  It's a frivolous thing, this worrying. As I was watching my two little blessings, experiencing spring on this farm for the first time, watching them and enjoying them, it all feels so right. Things have worked out just as they should, it feels like we are right where we are supposed to be. For that, I am most thankful."},

Someone thought they were for him.Anyway, they were well received and appreciated. But I got out of control and made a few more. They're just so fun to whip up! And I did a pig and chicken ones too.We don't need this many bags, so I'm may display them for sale at our local farm store.  First, I'll offer them up to you.  $10 a piece. $12 shipped. I'll even (gasp) take custom orders for the month of April.  I haven't done any custom work in a long time. Anyway, let me know if you're interested.  He doesn't want me to sell any, as he thinks they all should be for him. What a kid. Order them up now, start stocking up for holiday gifts.  Or better yet, tell me to get cracking on the pattern/tutorial, steal my idea and whip some up on your own! :)"},

I did what I always do, said a prayer for those involved.Later on, I found out that a teen driver hit a car head on.  In the car was a mom and two kids.  The kids survived, the mom didn't.  Totally and completely took/takes my breath away.  I drive this route all the time to work.  If I left minutes earlier, it could have been me.  Totally hits close to him, as this woman was a special education teacher and we've loved and shared some of the same kids.  I just can't stop thinking about this whole situation.I definitely hugged my babies extra tonight.  And I will likely be guilty of bringing them both in my bed when I go to bed, to snuggle until daddy comes home from his night shift.Truth is, today could be our last day.  You don't know what tomorrow will bring, but we've got today.I've rummaged through the box of clothes my mom saved from when I was a little girl.  It's been almost 17 years since I lost my mom, but I think of her daily.

I find all these pictures in my files and I have no idea why I take them or what to do with them.  So, here I go, I'll be rambling. What I want to know is am I am not the only mama on the planet who is constantly rotating, changing, putting away, setting up and organizing kid toys?  I hope I'm not.  I know kids play so much better with not too may toys out and about and when the toys are presented in a non jumbled way, but I sort of take it to the extreme.  I swear the toy set up at the beginning of the week doesn't always look like the toy organization by the end of the week.  I have four shelves to kid tables and oodles of wooden boxes and baskets and I constantly rotate.  And then I get excited about my new set up and take a picture?  I'm really quite ridiculous. I've shared some playsets and I could go through the archives and show you more, but trust me, I'm just silly.  Case in point...In one week, this very shelf went from something similar to a grocery store type like this...to a puzzle center. To misc. city. Guaranteed it will be something different by mid week. And then I get excited about this new bamboo set of silverware.  It cost just a few bucks, a perfect play utensil set (I sanded it down some after this pic). I have no idea why I took a picture of it, but here it is (along from the pottery I made when I took a class...I am a complete failure at pottery making).  So then I take a picture of the shelf I put them on?  I've really lost it.  I could go on and on about my crazy tactics...  But, what really doesn't seem crazy at all is taking pictures of the kids enjoying what I create for them.  I just love love love watching them play.  I could sit for hours watching them. I told you that was rambling.  And off I go to re-organize...."},

I never get tired of having you close.You eat everything, just about.  You love all fruit, all dessert and salad with ranch dressing and croutons lately.  Plus pasta, you love that too.  But nothing tops french fries. You're quite good at your list of chores...which you love to do.  I may be guilty of bribing you...for good behavior you earn more chores.  The rest of the world would think that's backwards, but not you.  You set and clear the table.  Load and unload the dishwasher.  Participate in all steps of laundry.  Feed the multiple pets.  Carry eggs safely.  Make sure everyone else (your daddy) stays on task.  You're the best boss out there...well other than me, that is.If you have to get from point A to B, you either run or hop like a kangaroo.  Who has time for leisurely walking?You love all your pets and want more.  You'll spend the morning just hanging with your chickens in the barn.  You're currently requesting a camel and a giraffe.  And a kangaroo.  Kangaroos are by far your favorites. You love making things for others in your play kitchen.  You whip up a batch of play cookies for your stuffed animals.  You make some soup for your rocking horse.  Coffee or hot chocolate for your parents.  You offer all the recipe, as you're sure that needs to be shared too. You've been a fan of your sister all along, up until she started moving.

You're eager to learn everything that we know. You look forward to our two school days a week when I dedicate the entire morning to teaching/playing with you.  You can't wait to see what I've got in your workboxes.  You're also a fan when friends are invited on our school days. You remember EVERYTHING.  You know who gave you every toy and every article of clothing.  You know when you got everything you have.  You remind me of stories that happened ages ago...like the balloon of yours I accidentally lost in April 2012. You also don't censor who hears the stories.  The whole grocery store line learned how dada made a mess when he fell through the ceiling.You're FINALLY a good sleeper.  Knock on wood. You say \"I love both mama and dada\".  You give us a hug with two arms around our neck, a kiss on our cheek, and often a kissing hand too.  Your manners are top notch.  You're super loving. You make us smile constantly. You're so easy to love.  We cannot imagine life without you.  You're a one in a million kid and we're incredibly lucky to be your parents. Happy two and a HALF, dear Adrian."},

It's not perfect, but it's a work in progress.Mason jars hold much of the smaller quantities I have bought in bulk.  I need to figure out a better way to label so I don't have to rely on smelling everything for identification.I have a couple plastic totes (Christmas ones) to hold the 50 pound bags of flour/oats. I moved some shelving in to organize the rest.   I have four glass pickle jars from my husband's restaurant days filled with rice.  It's a cold enough pantry to hold some produce and maple syrup. And potatoes and sugar.   I guess the coat hooks are good for something....clearly not coats.  Now...the marvelous thing about this place is there's a root cellar too.  Although old house basements give the heebie jeebies (I have no clue why), I spend little time organizing it down there. I wish I would have taken some pictures when the shelves were fuller of my home canned stuff...but there is still a bunch left.   You can see how much space there is....plenty of room for 6 quart jars deep. And I picture in the space below the cans to be some crates of squash, pumpkins potatoes and the like with this garden I'm dreaming of planting.  Behind that insulation is a window that opens for temperature control.  Only I wish there weren't pipes right there too.  Also, there's a floor to ceiling storage area on the side....filled with canning jars they left for us.  Must get busy! So there you have it...storage in this farmhouse.  Dried goods in the pantry.  Canned goods and likely root cellar type veggies eventually in the basement?  Suggestions for improvement, anyone?  And remember...tell me you cared about my pantry.  I said someone would care.  Prove me right."},

Lightly grease a 9\" x 13\" pan2) Crack the 4 eggs into a bowl, and beat them with the cocoa, salt, baking powder, espresso powder, and vanilla till smooth. 3) In a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, or in a saucepan set over low heat, melt the butter, then add the sugar and stir to combine. Or simply combine the butter and sugar, and heat, stirring, until the butter is melted. Continue to heat (or microwave) briefly, just until the mixture is hot (about 110°F to 120°F), but not bubbling; it'll become shiny looking as you stir it. Heating the mixture to this point will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies.4) Add the hot butter/sugar mixture to the egg/cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth.5) Add the flour and chips, again stirring until smooth. Note: If you want the chips to remain intact in the baked brownies, rather than melting in, let the batter cool in the bowl for about 20 minutes before stirring in the chips.  6) Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 9\" x 13\" pan.7) Bake the brownies for about 30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, or with just a few moist crumbs clinging to it. The brownies should feel set on the edges, and the center should look very moist, but not uncooked. Remove them from the oven and cool on a rack before cutting and serving."},

Playing in the snow is not my thing. However, I do make an effort to get out there with them.  I remember my parents playing with me in the snow and how special it was to have them make a fort, an igloo, trails in the driveway to follow or a family of bunny snowmen. So, I bundle up and keep my grumbling silent.  Hoping they won't think that I was a slug in the snow.  Can you spy my little snow lover? And his cute sister?  And Kammie? I grabbed a shovel and plant containers.  We (meaning me) made.....  an igloo/fort. No wonder why I'm not a fan...I'm always doing the grunt work.

You know what excited me even more?  I had a top that fit this tea container perfectly.  It's worth much more than $1.99, but I'm not selling, so don't ask.  It will go perfect with my hypothetical summer picnics.

So, I got the fancy idea to cover them up.In the bathroom, I used scrap paper.  Mod podged it on and then used a thompson water seal clear waterproof protectant spray.  (All of which was just hanging around our house).  Spiffed it up nicely, I'd say.   And in the playroom, I went for more fun.  I used fabric.  I just modpodged and skipped the waterproof part.  In fact i found the fabric to be easier to do than the paper.  I think it looks more spiffy in there too.  And in the hallway, I used this fab navy and polk a dot fabric.  I just love how these came out. I don't know if they'll all stay for good, but I think it's all much better than almond color against white.  And I just love that it was F-R-E-E.  Don't those four letters spell a word that gives you flutters in your belly?  Okay, now for you...what room are you going to attempt spiffing up with outlet covers?"},

Less shopping trips in and of itself gives me extra hours each week with my babies. Making sure we're home to make yogurt or bread once a week gives us the down time we need as a family.  Home is where we want to be, we love this farmhouse so. I've been asked a time or two how I have time to make all of our bread from scratch.  My view?  A chunk of time every week to be home, to get our hands dirty, smell the baking bread, sample while it's still warm, be together as a family...I make time for all of that. Life's too busy not to.Buying bulk, making from scratch, carving out a chunk of time each week to make bread (recipe here), give it a go.  Perhaps you'll enjoy it too."},

Since I did scare off a full size bear at the coop door one night, a hawk was the only predator who got lucky.  I declared ourselves successful chicken farmers and was going to buy chicks last year.  I changed my mind after thinking about having 2 kids under the age of two with a family of baby chicks.  Good thing...I didn't know we would be moving with two little ones as well.  Fast forward to today, we have only 2 lone chickens left.  Not laying, so I just ordered a bunch of baby chicks from the farm store.  I went to feed the girls this morning and only found one.  Oh no, I thought. I figured I knew what was in store.  I prepared myself to have the wind knocked out of me again from finding a dead chicken (so not the glamorous part of raising chickens).  I found our barred rock behind a wooden boat, hunkered down behind an empty window pane.  I poked her and she moved.  I was thinking she was on her way out.  But then she moved, and I found this:  Squee!!!  I went to find my little farmer...he hasn't collected eggs in some time. We live in Maine..so coats aren't required if the temperature is over 25 degrees.  Thick skin we have grown. Was he ever excited!\" Thank you, chickens!\" he quipped again and again. Ah yes, a great discovery. And a delighted little farmer. Certainly a great start to a day."},

But then, on a whim one night, I started ripping the wall paper down (I was afraid the strong yellows would show through the paint eventually).  I probably was up until 1:30 am stripping wall paper, with still more to do.  Not a fun project.  We had a half of a gallon left over gray paint from the bathroom we remodeled in the last house (see here), and white paint from our last kitchen remodel (see here), some black spray paint to dress up the silver fixtures (knobs, shelves, toilet paper roll, towel racks), and then curtains and decorations from the other bathroom/other rooms.  I used them all and am proud to say that thus far...our bathroom upgrade has been *free*.  Sure it's not perfect and if we had a budget, I'd be getting rid of almond appliances and replacing the linoleum, but for the price, I think it looks much more our style.  Perhaps you agree?Before:  After: (And yes, I made these curtains.)

We definitely were not planning on getting a rabbit today. We went  to the farm store to get chicken food and to order baby chicks.  And this little bunny was hopping around, looking to be re-homed.  We were sold.  Such a gentle personality, but a spunky bunny.  So soft to pet.  We're smitten with \"Hop\". Adrian introduced his bunny to Hop. Claimed that Hop needed a friend. Did you know bunnies love music?  That's what he told me.  He's been serenaded all day.

My dad reminds me that we will be living in this place forever, so we have a lifetime to get it perfect.  He's right, of course, but it doesn't stop me from wanting things done at a quicker pace than I can muster.

The cup is half full.Anyway, I have \"progress with the bathroom pictures\" to show you soon.  I also have to take pictures of this room.  This is our 'dining' room, that I declared should be our playroom instead.  With an eat in kitchen, we don't need a formal dining right now.  Given the amount of time I spend in the kitchen, having the kids play close by sounded like a good plan.  Although who am I kidding...they never leave my side!  At least when the timer goes off, I can hear it when we're playing in the next room.So...I have completed painting this room.  It took three coats of paint to paint over the wallpaper.  I tried to do one wall a day.  Given there's four walls and it needed three coats...well, it wasn't a paint in a day project. It is done now, wahoo!  As I was trying to tidy the room, tucking loose ends away, and planning on taking pictures for you, I couldn't take my eyes off these built ins.  I do love them so.  However, the inside was  painted mauve. I was saving the painting of them for a rainy day, as it wasn't necessary to get to immediately.  That was the plan at least.  But... I could not enjoy this room without my eyes locking and fixating on those mauve built ins.  So what did I do? Empty the entire cabinet and begin painting.  Sigh.  What I get myself into. 3 more coats of paint and a room that's a huge mess. Long story short...I did not get to take pictures of the rest of the room (that was mostly done!).  I made such a huge mess of it when reorganizing that it is put back on the to do list.  Sigh.I can at least show you the built ins.  That's better than nothing for now, isn't it?Here's the before and after:Ahh, so much better.I know it's meant to hold china, but it instead houses our toys.  We have many more toys than china, that's for sure.  I do love our toys....the majority of which are wooden, metal or cloth...many are homemade.  Most of the gift givers in my kids' lives know that's how we roll.  The occasional plastic toy we do have I end up bringing to work as soon as they tire of it (and then they rediscover it when they come see me at work, so it cycles home).  I do love the basic toys we have available on a regular basis...I firmly believe keeping the toys simple encourages play.  Aren't these built ins grand?!Next on the agenda is to finish the rest of the room so I can share that."},

We aim for around the 6th month.  With both kids, we've had them pretty consistently pooping on the potty so we don't have poppy cloth diapers to rinse with solids (we do Elimination Communication).  We don't feed our babies, we present the food and see whether or not they're interested in giving it a go.

I know I need to give myself some slack, but I want it all done yesterday.  I decided to grab the camera and show you my piles.  Totally owning this chaos here and going to try to put a positive spin on the mess...Much to do in the bathroom...but I did strip the wall paper (didn't want those loud orange/yellow flowers showing through).These two 'new to me' chairs need refinishing...I was looking for chairs to go with this little found table I have. I look at these knobs and counter-tops and want them gone....but we have a new refrigerator that actually works, the luxury!  No more storing everything in the wood shed.There's curtain rods to hang, much painting to be done....but we did accomplish one floor (I need to show you the rest of this room, don't I?).  Many days, I'm cleaning up breakfast when it's time to make dinner....but I did get some bread made. I still haven't filled vases in the house with fresh greenery like I had planned....but we are still eating. There's gifts to finish... but at least they've been started. The nursery looks like this...which fortunately is more tidy than it was a couple weeks ago. There's more projects in need of painting on our porch...thankful we have a space to keep them out of the way.Everytime I think something is clean, I turn around and there's a bigger mess...but at least their toys are no longer packed.     You know how many days I've declared to be 'pajama days'?  Not because it's a fun thing to do, but because by the time I'm finished unpacking, unloading, fixing up, catching leaks, finding drips, changing addresses, etc, it's just been a pajama day before I've had a chance to make it otherwise.But you know?  Pajama days are quite fun.

I did take the easy way out and we used our fake tree.  Much prefer real, but given we're not fully moved in, it will suffice for this year.Here's a link to the advent calendar. And here's all about our tradition with every Christmas framed.  As a side note, I only bought 10 of these frames when I first met my husband...and this is our 9th Christmas together.  If any of you see similar frames while you're out and about shopping, please let me know.  I need to buy more! Does this count as a recent crafty project?  I found this frame for free this summer.  I strung clothes line rope and pinned pictures and our Christmas cards on it.  Not sure if I'll keep it like this permanently, but it's good for now. Our blue and silver \"good enough\" tree.  And blooming Christmas cactus...given to us as a housewarming gift from our neighbors.  It's a clipping from the one the woman who lived here grew.  Very special indeed.  And my garland.  And our Christmas stockings, that I was supposed to embroider by this year.  Maybe next year.   And our two perfect presents under the tree.

It's with a heavy heart I look at these and think of grieving parents.  But, I carry on for these two kids.I told Adrian that he was going to get a Christmas gift early.  On that Christmas gift would be a clue of what we were going to do for the day.  He enthusiastly cheered \"See trains!\".  I guess it didn't matter that we can do that from our backyard.  I told him instead we were going to ride on a train.This is him grinning ear to ear.  His sister was right by, looking cute.  He told her what was happening. And she smiled a smile of delight too.  Off we go.  We arrive.  He's shocked to be at the 'station'.  All it is is a little antique trolley museum around the corner from us.  It had 'Disney' type magical feel in his book. Here he is...smiling his big cheesy smile.  He's so darn happy. He didn't want his coat zipped so everyone could see his train shirt. Trains, trains and more trains.  It's like he's meeting the queen. He held on tight to these tickets.  And did not miss a thing.   I whispered to the conductor that his name was Adrian.  The conductor said \"All aboard Adrian\".  Let me tell you...his eyes got even wider. He completely freezes once we get on the train.  Utter shock.   It did look mighty fancy, this restored 1924 trolley. He checks for his tickets, holds onto those tight.  The conductor offers him a chance to step on the warning bell and to blow the whistle.  He definitely took him up on the offer. Audra, where was she?  Alert in the sling....close to mama.The funny thing about this experience is this little boy \"needs\" his mama for everything.  He talks about \"needing\" me all the time.  But, he wanted his own seat on this train.  He had important business to take care of. Audra wasn't even allowed to sit by him.  Here he is...all by himself...waiting for the conductor. While someone was squealing close by. He's not going to miss the conductor collecting these tickets, let me tell you. Audra isn't into this whole train thing, so she's going to squeal and look cute instead.  But he's serious.  Unwavering. He has an agenda.  He may have 'shushed' her a couple times. This is when he spotted the conductor, coming to take the tickets.  He proudly offered them up. And was enthralled with the half hour ride. Twice the train stopped at intersections.  Adrian was convinced the trolley needed a tow truck both times, so he offered his advice.  At the next intersection, they let this little Adrian come ahead and blow the warning whistle.  It was a very important job that he was proud to do. Trains.  Such an important love for this boy. It feels pretty darn good that we gave him the world this day.  (Especially since it was only the next town over and we spent a grand total of $12.00.)   Hot cocoa after.   And we've heard the events of the visit to the trolley museum every.single.day since.  He's got a list of people he's going to bring the next time.  It was a good day, and I think we have already been propositioned for a return visit."},

Since I'm the praying type, I've been doing lots of praying lately.  A lot.  I don't know what else to do.  It's not like these families lost their house and we can send money or clothes.  There's nothing that can replace what they lost.  What they'd give for another chance to read one more book, build one more tower, push their child on the swing just once more, rock their child to sleep, wake up in the middle of the night to console them...they'd give anything. A friend posted this on my facebook page:  \"Tighter, more frequent hugging....of all ages\".  So true.  It doesn't matter if we're not \"ready\" for Christmas, if our house is perfect, what we ate, what we created.  Love is what matters.  I'm going to love them with my whole heart and then some more while I keep praying with all my might."},

(And if you're me, upon first look, gasp a gasp of awe). Peek right, let your glance linger.  And be torn between looking left and inspecting the right side just a bit longer. Peek left. Stare.  Look at these beams, you'll say. The woodwork just draws you in.You'll think of all the love and hard work that went into the raising of this barn. Then you start noticing detail.  Like this ladder. And some hidden doors.    Oh, and there's people in here.You almost missed this little jabberbox. And the beginnings of my husband's new gym. You start watching them, but you can't help but to look up again and admire those beams again. Tug tug, you feel.  It's me....telling you there's more to see. Lots of hidden treasures.Openings for the cows and oxen that lived here. Projects that may have been started, but not completed.  Miscellaneous, interesting things.  Is it you who is missing a boot?  Oh, not you?  Speaking of boots, I hope you brought yours.  I've got mine.  While you're looking, it's a fancy stoop, isn't it?It's a perfect road for trucks.We'll head back outside to check the grand chicken suite.Hey, I spy a farmer! And some chickens who have lots of space to roam.And a boat to perch on.  How many chickens get their own boat? And these lucky chickens get picture windows, a whole wall of them. You won't notice these little homeowner type things...like how safe is the electrical?And running water...can that be hooked up again?  All in time, I'll say.A tiny farmer will urge you along. Come on, there's more to see!  Walk along the fence and you'll see the former pasture.  Overgrown, yes, but you'll picture the meandering pregnant mama cows waiting for their babies to arrive.  You'll notice the pathway where the cows used to exit.  And you'll picture a herd of cows slowly moving out to pasture, in no hurry whatsoever. You'll peek under the barn and see the wide open space. You'll ignore the windows that need a little love, you'll be dreaming of what it will be.  You'll be very impressed with the work my husband did to preserve the structure and you'll be picturing the cows, just chilling in the shade on a warm summer's day. Oops.  I forgot to show you this door.  This leads to underneath the barn.  Yes, it's wide open.  And this soil has oodles of worms from the years of manure deposited here.  (Garden here it comes!)  You'll volunteer to haul some to the garden immediately.  Okay, maybe not, but it was worth a try, right?! You'll have to stretch your imagination far when you see how much brush there is to remove, but you'll be visualizing.  You'll walk around the barn, either counting your lucky stars you're not the one to do the work or you'll be dreaming of your someday barn.  Either way, you'll think that these little kids are fortunate to grow up playing in a barn like this.And you'll be planning your return visit...one glance at this barn just isn't enough.  You'll have to come back, especially when it's filled with animals."},

Greenery to be cut. Traditions to continue.  People to visit.  Cards to mail. Memories to make. All the stuff I love. But we're still unpacking.  This old farmhouse hasn't had a workout of many living the roof in a looong time.  In fact, it was one year ago that the sweet woman who lived here passed away.  It's been over a year since these walls have had any activity.  And we apparently have stressed important things...such as water...to the max.  Yes, on top of unpacking and trying to update a little, we've had numerous unexpecteds.  Well, not that we really didn't expect to have projects....just not all at once.  And during the Christmas season. So, I'm telling you this...  If you usually get a plate of delicious holiday goodness from me, you won't get it before Christmas.  If you enjoy holiday mail from me, it will be late.  If I was going to make you a gift, it will be even later.  If you had a baby or got married, I will still make you something...hopefully before your child graduates high school.  If I owe you a thank you card, I haven't forgotten.  I'm trying, I really am, but I can't do it all.But, what I can and will do is slow down enough for snuggles, books and together time.  I may feel frenzied, but it's my job as their mama to keep even for them.  I need to remind myself of that.  What matters most is not that my Christmas platters are perfect or my cards make it there before the holiday.  Homemade gifts are (hopefully) just as special after the holidays as they would be before.  No one is going to remember the Christmas when I didn't have it together. But, my kids will remember that their mama read \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\" seven times in one day.  They'll remember we stacked the tallest tower before the cat knocked it down. They'll remember I ate dinner with them every night. They'll remember squealing when we played chase with the dog.  They'll remember their mama let them bake bread with her.  They'll remember playing 'duck duck goose' in the kitchen.  They'll remember I snuggled them and held them close. They'll remember if I'm that mama who puts them first.  And they'll remember I'm the mama who takes their picture entirely too much.   So that's what I'm doing...the stuff that matters. And I hope you'll forgive me for not being my usual 'me' during the holidays.  Time is too precious to waste fretting over what's to do, I'm going to enjoy the here and now.  And I hope you'll do the same."},

It's fun to look out in our woods (10 acres of woods!).  I wonder if there will be a Christmas tree out there for us to cut?  I know there will be some wood we will burn.  I wonder how many maple trees we will find to tap?I wonder what animals this barn and the fields will hold?  (While my little guy is planning where his live kangaroos will live in the barn).And it's fun to look at this site and dream of what the garden will be.  I want a HUGE garden, but know I must be smart and not plant too much the first year here.  Rhubarb and garlic is in.  And my neighbor told me there's asparagus to be looking for as well. It's also fun to look at our home, think of the memories created there before us and dream of the memories we will create.  (Isn't the moon grand?!) Live really is quite good."},

I'm betting they stood back and admired their handiwork, proudly.  They probably loved the new results and couldn't wait to share it with their friends. They perhaps had husbands who were thankful the project was over and were worrying what their wife would dream up next.  Okay, so maybe that's just my husband.  The point is...when I think of the love put into this home, I see the wallpaper in a new light.  It does seem to make home feel a little cozy (well, except for the bathroom wallpaper...what were they thinking?!).  Maybe you agree?I probably will still end up painting over the wallpaper.  But before I do, I think it's worth admiring just a bit, don't you?"},

Just yesterday he said \"Mama, that's Audra\". You know, in case I wasn't aware.  He loves her so much and hates when she sleeps.  If he catches her sleeping, if I'm not watching him like a hawk, I soon hear baby squeals and a big brother announcing proudly, \"Audra wake up, mama!\".  Hmm...wonder how that happened?  He seriously loves her...shares all his books and makes sure she has a toy.  He even shares his 'roos' with her and picks out her clothes.  \"Audra look nice, mama\". The part that is even more awesome is we're starting to see the reciprocity of the love from her.  She lights up when she sees him.  If he's sad or throwing a fit, she has been known to start a giggling fit, which he cannot help but smile.  She loves him just as much as he loves her.My husband recently caught them giggling together.  He couldn't help but stare...and I swear I saw him puddle up just a bit (although he'd never admit it).  He said \"I never got to experience having a sibling (he's an only child)...this is just so much fun to watch.

The goal was to divide a few of my favorites.  I took inventory of what's already at the farmhouse so I didn't move what was already there and slowly started to pot the ones I must not be without.  Most of my plants were dug and shared by friends...I didn't want to leave those stories behind. I somehow managed to pot 53 different types of perennials!  Fifty-three.  And that's leaving the stuff that the farmhouse had. And leaving the stuff too hard to find now the frost hit and the stuff I don't care for. Oh my.  The new owners of the house we live in now won't even notice I took anything (assuming we'll eventually have new owners and we won't have two homes forever).  I...um...didn't realize how addictive my perennial gardening had gotten.  I didn't even get a chance to show you my gardens.  Oh well, you'll see them as they grow at the farmhouse. And if you're local, once they grow again, I am happy to share.Here's part way....  (Naturally, the fire truck was handy in case there was a fire.  You can never be too careful).I, of course, had two very helpful...sometimes too helpful...little hands.As well as two sets of eyes sometimes watching and sometimes resting.  I used a sharpie and plastic spoons to ID the flowers.  Good idea in theory, until my helper \"reorganized\" the spoons for me.  Day two... we successfully moved them to our farmhouse.  The goal was to plant as many as I was able, given that I was by myself with two kids, it didn't seem hopeful. But miraculously, I did plant them all.  Well, except the rhubarb.  Wanted to ask my husband on that one.  You'd think that it would be a trite crazy, all that planting by myself with the two littles.  But, in fact, it was one of the most mentally relaxing days I've had in a long time.  The sun was warm (well, you wouldn't know it, as Adrian insisted on wearing this hat), the conversation swell and you can't beat the setting.  Sweet Audra was kind enough to balance wanting to be in mama's arms and chilling in the sun.  Adrian carried the pots to me and hauled excess dirt in his John Deere loader.  I dug away. I couldn't believe how rich the soil was.  There were at least 3 big fat worms in every hold dug.  I found a broken bottle, some pottery and some old nails....and dreamed about how those very things ended up there.At the end of the day, we were a tad dirty and definitely tired from that hard work, but still mustered up the energy to make cream cheese brownies. (Hey, we earned them, don't you think? Must blog that recipe, too...) A fantastic day at the farm.  A first day of many.  I'm so thankful for that."},

Plus, I could sit here for hours, sharing pictures and telling you all about it. All in time.First things first.  Keys in our hand, we went to our new house.   We said prayers of gratitude and then played chase between the rooms.  We played hide and seek. We laughed and enjoyed each other.  There was so much we could be doing, but we didn't do anything that had to be done.The next morning, the first thing I did was remove the curtains and shades to let the light in.  Then I sat and dug through the toys with my kids.  Just my little ones and me. Yes, that list ran through my mind, but I ignored it. (Do you see the floors?  Big puffy heart love!)My husband and I made a commitment a few nights ago. Even though there is much to do during this transition, we're not going to lose sight of what's important.  Family time is going to come ahead of our list.  We're still going to diaper our kids and feed our kids the way we feel is best for them.  We're going to stop and play.  We're not going to rush. It will all get done...it's up to us to choose how it gets done.  We can get it done in a hurry and turn into a flustered mess or we can calmly and collectively do what needs to be done as we are able, being mindful of what really matters.There's always a lot on our agenda and yours too, I'm sure.  Sometimes I feel overwhelmed thinking of the upcoming Holiday season...and now we're adding a move with two small children.  Yikes!  But...how we go about our list resonates loudly in our children.  Our approach teaches them so much about how to face their challenges in their day to day lives.  Choosing to tackle that list with smooth and steady grace is what our kids need from us.  (I'm in love with the built ins!)A little story about these trains.  The first night we had the house, our dear Adrian packed up his trains to move.  The trains that the BOG made him are very important, you see. Adrian meticulously lined up his trains that he was moving in on a shelf that was left there. He was so proud of himself, moving these into the \"new house\".  But, when it came time to go, he was determined to pack his trains and bring them with him.  Couldn't convince him otherwise.  I'm guessing moving will be a long process if we move our favorites back and forth on a regular basis.  But, we will embrace these days with a smile and slow down enough to let these memories sink in.  It will all get done...might as well enjoy the ride."},

The pile of mama made mail was left there by him.  I just added the bag.He played briefly, but then said he was hungry.  Priorities.  I don't blame the kid.I'm sure it will be a hit in the future.  Want to make your own?  You can even put someone's name on the bag instead of mail.  I know you want to give it a try.DIY TUTORIAL*seams are 1/4 inch.1) Out of a thicker fabric (I used courdory), cut the following:Two 9in x 12 1/2in rectanglesTwo 12 1/2 in x 12 1/2 in squaresOne strip 3 in x 30 1/2One strip 44 in x 6 in Out of fleece, cut the letters from this template.2) Pin the 3x 30 1/2 in strip to one of the rectangles, right sides together. You'll start at the top left side, pin the bottom and pin the remaining side.  The top will not be stitched.  You will have to ease around corners.  Stitch with a 1/4 inch seam and finish seam.  Repeat with the other rectangle, pinning and stitching it to the other edge of the strip. Turn right side out. Press seams flat. 3) Place two large rectangles right sides together.  Fold in half.  Place a bowl in upper corner (any size will do).  Trace curve and cut.  Open.  4) Stitch right sides together both sides and curved edge.  Leave bottom open. Finish seam. Turn right side out, press and top stitch edges. 5) Pin top flap to base along one of the rectangles edges. Right sides together. Stitch in place.  Finish remaining edges of opening. 6) Press all finished edges of opening down, top stitching in place. 7) Fold 6in strip in half the long way, right sides together.  Stitch the long edge.  Turn inside out and press.  Top stitch each edge. 8) Turn bag inside out. Pin a strap to each side.  Stitch a long rectangle to hold the straps in place (This is where you can decide where to place the straps to be the right length for your little postal worker).  9) Adhere the letters to the front of the bag with either fuisable interfacing or pins.  Stitch in place with a straight stitch if it's a non fraying fabric like fleece.  If it's something else, zig zag stitch will applique in place nicely.  10) Photograph your finished project (preferable with your miniature mail delivery friend) and share your creation with me! I'm also happy to hear any feedback on what worked and what was confusing."},

I know what he wants or needs before he says anything. I can read her cues and signs before she even fusses. I know more of what he knows, what he doesn't know and what he wants to learn.  I know what she's interested in, what's overwhelming for her and when she want mama close.  As a bonus...he's had better behavior and has been remarkable cooperative and helpful.  She has been even more easygoing than her usual easy going self, she's been communicating her potty needs so clearly and has hardly needed diapers the last couple of days.In this busy paced world, we don't do this enough.  Staying home is good.  Connecting with our kids is good.  Saying \"no\" in favor of unscheduled family time is good.  They're only little once.  There's no time like the present to soak it all in."},

{"title": "Upcycled Fall Tree Craft", "date": null, "text": "I sometimes find the debate on whether or not it's good to have planned craft projects for kids interesting.  Obviously the kid projects based on a model are cute as cute can be. They often work on following directions, which the therapist side of me likes.  But some say they squelch creativity and sometimes the projects are done more by the adults than the kids.When I was a kid, I loved loved loved project time (big surprise).  I loved when a model was set out for inspiration and I could put my own spin on it.  I also loved art time without rules too. As a mama, I go along with a hybrid.  We have plenty of crafting times without an agenda, but my little guy also enjoys projects. Now...I wanted to share a tip on what I've done as a therapist and will continue to do as a mama.  I get an idea for a crafty project.  Whip up a model.  I then prep enough for a dozen or so.  I let creativity flow, as many are created as wanted, and then store the extras away for next year.  The prep ahead of time means there's more chances for creativity and less work from me.  During a busy week, it's nice to pull out a file folder from last year and boom...there's a project you don't even have to prep for. This fall tree is an activity that my mom did with me when we were kids.  Upcycled, just the way I like it.I free handed a tree on a paper bag and cut it out to paste on plain paper.  (I included the template in case you would rather not draw your own tree). Template here. The leaves are tissue paper left over from a gift.  Tear, crumple and glue.  A great fall project.Even for a two year old. As an added bonus, it will be fun to see how his tree from this year and next year differ. I'm guessing there will be more kid crafting ideas coming up now that my oldest is more able.  Unsure of whether to blog about kid crafting ideas or not.  Thoughts?  Feedback is appreciated!"},

Really, it can be whatever you want it to be.    Edges are finished with a serger.  It clasps together with an upcycled snap from baby clothes.   I sort of, kind of, went (maybe) a little overboard with making these.  There's another dozen that I didn't photograph in addition to these.  Just couldn't fit them all in the camera lens.  I find them so fun, I couldn't stop making them!  If you're a winner, you will have your choice of color and you will receive some fun mail!Remember, to enter the giveaway...If you're a current reader, just share my blog (on facebook or with a pal) and let me know.  If you aren't a reader yet, join up on facebook, via email or blogger and let me know.Odds of winning are 1 in 8 or better.Hopefully you'll be a winner and be getting some fun mail soon.  Thank you, most kindly, for being one of my readers.  Go out and make it a great Monday!"},
{"title": "It was one of \"those\" days.", "date": null, "text": "I usually take a few minutes to blog before I go to bed.  But yesterday (Friday) was one of \"those\" days.  I had the whole day before us with quite the agenda.  It was a day of being home, checking off that to do list, enjoying my kids, eating something yummy, squeezing in a bit of crafting and then smiling with a big smile at the end of my day with a sense of accomplishment.  And then blogging about it. That was the plan.But, sometimes plans don't happen as planned. Wrench after wrench screwed with my agenda. Our car broke down, which we weren't nearly as excited as our enthusiastic two year old.  My husband had to work overtime...again.  I forgot an ingredient we needed.  Our dishwasher decided to retire, filled with an (overly) full load of dirty dishes and a sink cascading with more dirties.  I forgot to dry the diapers. I had a two year old who opted not to nap (and was consequently crying off and on for the day) and I had a 3 month old who refused to be put down.  Usually it's delightful to have her so close to mama, but there are some chores that I have not successfully figured out to do while having another human strapped to me.  And of course the day was filled with those types of chores-mounds of dishes to hand wash, cleaning the chicken coop, turning the compost, cutting back flower beds for winter, carrying bins of maternity clothes to storage, filling the woodbox and gathering some kindling, sweeping/mopping and the like. And the chores that I could do with a baby I could not get ahead of.  I have no idea why.  Every room I left looked untouched, despite spending ample time striving for an improvement.  My grand meal plan ended up being oatmeal, a far cry from what I intended. I had a dull, aching headache that never really went away. You know exactly what I'm talking about.  \"Those\" days.At the end of the day, when I was setting out to blog (but never got to), I did have a chance to upload my pictures.  I didn't look at them, but I uploaded them.  I had no idea what I snapped and I was sure that after a day like that, there wouldn't be a worthy one in the bunch.Tonight I peek at the pictures I took.  And you know what?  I'm so glad I kept my camera handy.  There's snapshots of my day yesterday that made me smile.  How can that be?  I surely didn't smile at all yesterday.But...in the crazy chaos otherwise known as our kitchen, a little helper was trying to help in all the wrong ways.  I cut a pumpkin in half and told him he could help me by taking out the pumpkin seeds.  Boy, did he deliver.  Every last seed.And I notice now that he was wearing a mama made hat.  How can I not smile about that?And now that I think of it, I did stop to take a picture of this little sweet face looking up at me. And I do remember stopping long enough to look at those eyes a bit longer, long enough to snap another picture.I was able to put our sweet girl down long enough to put my coat on.  I do remember this picture wasn't staged.  They were just interacting, talking, enjoying each other and the camera happened to be handy.  An added bonus they both seemed to roll their eyes at me at the same time.And I remember chuckling a secret chuckle about how our oldest would much prefer to be helping me than doing anything else in the whole wide world.  I may have uttered to him yesterday, \"Remember, if you listen, you can help mama with the laundry\".  I now smile thinking about how ridiculous it is that a promise like works. How did I say that with a serious tone yesterday?He filled much of this woodbox himself while I was on the phone.  \"Help mama\" he said. At the end of the day, I remember I looked around our house, it seemed like the same colossal mess that I started with never was touched.  I happened to notice a sweet little dozer snuggled in close to me.  I must have smiled long enough to take another picture.Looking back at that set of pictures, I cannot fathom how I never even thought yesterday was a 'terrible no good, very bad day'.  Certainly, my house was not ready for show.  Laundry may have been heaped.  Dishes not yet put away. The to-do list was still plenty long. There was no tasty treat for my husband to come home to.  All we ate was oatmeal for dinner.  But does all that really matter?Absolutely not, it doesn't matter one bit.   I need to remind myself of this more often. I do not need to rush through the day frenzied.  Take a deep breath, Jackie. Realize all you have.  Enjoy them.  Slow down.  Make memories.  Live with what's not done.  Love them.When all was said and done, at the end of the day, my little two year old looked up at me in a loving way and said...\"Mmm, delicious!  Thank you oatmeal, sweet mama.\"  It's all a matter of perspective."},

Directions on how to make this carrier are at the bottom of this post. The great thing about this carrier is important things (like little roos) can be in the pocket... Or you can just use the carrier to carry bigger Roos.     Or still even bigger teddies.  That's the great part...it's adjustable.   (Front view above, side view below).  It holds up for dancing time too.  Which is important.He's so fatherly.  He learns from an awesome daddy, that's for sure. Needless to say, my little guy is a fan.  Directions to DIY:Dimensions of fleece pocket:  Rectangle measuring 17 in. x 8in. Top straps:  two strips measuring 3 in. x 22 in.Bottom straps:  3 1/2 in. x 22 in. 1) Fold short ends of rectangle in by 1/2 inch.  Stitch in place.  2) Add applique to front of pocket, if desired.3) Make straps. You'll have 2 thinner straps and 2 thicker straps. Fold straps in half, the long way, right sides together. Use 1/4 inch seam to stitch one short and the long edge.  Turn right side out.  Press.  Top stitch.  Repeat so you have 4 straps. 4) Pin right sides of pocket together.  With selvage edges together, pin the thinner straps in place at the top of the pocket and the thicker straps in place at the bottom of the pocket.  (You'll have to gather the bulk of the strap in the pocket while you stitch).  Stitch each edge of the pocket, 1/2 inch seam.  Turn inside out, press and top stitch."},

Particularly with the spike in heat (which I'm not a heat fan anyway), I've been willing these last few days to pass quickly.But, today I had quite the change of heart.  These days shouldn't be rushed.  They should be savored.  I don't have many more days where it will be just my little guy and me...connecting, bonding, laughing, snugging and enjoying one another.  Yes, we will still do this once our little girl is here...but I don't want to wish away the uninterrupted time we get together now.  Beach time, just the two of us. \"Beach fun mama!\".  Reading 15 books in a row. \"More dooks mama\". Playing his favorite board game for an hour straight.  \"Teddy same mama.\"  Making cupcakes. \"Mmm.  Help mama.\"  Filling dumptrucks with rocks. \"Brrrm, dumptruck\".  Those random moments when he just wants a snuggle. \"Kiss mama cheek\".  Playing peek-a-boo, complete with the giggles that follow.  \"Scare mama, BOO!\"    Yes, I may be large, hot and uncomfortable.  Yes, I cannot wait to meet our little girl.  But, I vow to not wish away these last moments or days with just the two of us.  All the complaining doesn't help, babies come when they're ready.  Besides, there's too many memories to make while we wait."},

With this carrier that I made, I've had 10 carriers so far (GULP!).  Granted, all but one were given or loaned to me...but I'm sort of a baby wearing junkie.  My faves with baby #1 were the moby for the first few months, the Ergo for then after and the ring sling as a quick go to around the house from the beginning and the only comfortable one to use while pregnant. Believe it or not, even with my gigantic baby bump, I'm still baby wearing...only I guess now it would be called toddler wearing. But my little guy says he's a kangaroo and it's his pouch. Anyway...Did I mention I loved my moby the first time around?  The only problem is it's 100% cotton.  Worked fine for a fall baby, but now I will have a summer baby.  Which means it's inevitable with an older brother that she may get splashed during some sort of water fun (ocean, St. Lawrence River, pool, etc).   100% cotton takes an eternity to dry.  So, I traced my Moby onto swimsuit fabric and made one suitable for summer living.  It will dry quickly...so if she does get a teensy bit wet, I don't have to worry about her sitting in wet cotton.  I hope it works. I know it just looks like a hunk of fabric, which I guess it is...but I finished the edges and tapered it to fit well.If you have no idea what I'm talking about, here's Adrian in his moby as a baby...nice and snug with mama.  Right where he belongs.And here's Adrian now, not so tiny anymore.

How he can eat an entire batch of whatever dessert I make in an instant. How he's never in a hurry.  How he begins each morning with a broadway rendition of something random, when I just want to wake up with a few moments of silence. Plus, I don't want to touch his gross feet. Yes, there's a little room for improvement.However, there's nothing I'd change about his parenting. I don't have anything negative to say about him as a dad.  It's because he's great at it.  He demonstrates the perfect balance between being consistent and letting go and having fun.  He takes pleasure in teaching his son, always willing to have a sidekick.  He leads by example and always seems to know just what to do. This says a lot given that he's in charge while I work.  His son loves him, looks up to him, admires him.  And because of this man, we likely have the only 21 month old kid in the world who regularly has experience and can demonstrate his accomplishment in doing push ups, squats, bench pressing and heavy bag work outs.Happy Father's Day to the best daddy in the world!  Here's last year's collection of daddy pictures and below is this year's collection.  We love you!"},

Turn inside out, press and top stitch.  That will be the hat brim.5) Place right sides of hat brim and hat top together.  Pin, easing around curves (lots of pins for this part, you may need to do some shimmying).  Stitch and finish seam.  Press.  I top stitched along upper edge of hat brim to keep seam down.6) Embellish how you'd like."},

Of course we had to get decked in our giraffe shirt and our tiger tail. It's always a good day, being together as a family.  Seeing the animals never gets tiring.          But, at the end of the day, this little tiger of mine spots flowers.   If he spots flowers, he automatically thinks of his mama.  For which he needs to spend an undetermined amount of time picking and sharing them.  Not only with his mama, but his little sister too.    It won't be long before this very large mama delivers a tiger cub for the big brother.   I cherish the sweet memories we have and look forward to the ones we will make with both tiger cubs of ours.  I may need to make a 2nd tail.  Life is quite good."},

{"title": "He wants to be just like us...", "date": null, "text": "Something that really drives me nuts is when we're out an about and someone says \"Wow, you must have your hands full\".  I feel like saying instead, \"No, I'm raising the biggest blessing I have ever received and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.\"  Of course, a kid is a kid...and it's not like he never gets himself into mischief and it's not like he never has tried out how well a tantrum would work on us.  But all in all, this journey into parenthood is filled with joy.One personality trait that I find most amusing in our little guy is he wants to be just like us.  In everything he does. We have had zero need for any sort of gate or child safety contraptions in this house, as he's always right under our feet.  He rarely wanders off into the other room without us, and if he does, it's to retrieve something for us.  Now, it's not like we need to entertain him...he'll happily play with his toys while we're doing whatever we need to do.  But more often than not, he's trying to be just like us, trying to be one step ahead of us, guessing what we're going to do, \"helping\", while giving a detailed narrative. Most often if he gets into trouble, it's from being too helpful.  For example, independently guessing a cup of flour is needed while baking, to acquiring it and offering it, but accidentally spilling the whole cup on the floor in the process, to trying to wipe up the mess with a cloth napkin he retrieved for the job, to knowing the cloth napkin belongs in the laundry once soiled, to delivering that soiled napkin to the laundry.  Before we know it, there's flour spread across the entire kitchen, and our little guy, with a trail leading to the laundry room.   All of this right under our nose, as we're trying to retrieve a broom to clean up the job.Now, I know I went on a tangent here.  What I really am trying to say is kids need to be celebrated!  The quirky messes they make, the trouble they get into, the mistakes they make.  It's all a celebration.  It's not about having our \"hands full\" as parents, it's delighting in the journey of raising children the best we can.  No two kids are the same...but each child's individuality needs to be celebrated.So, I'm celebrating our little guy and his uniqueness.  I'm chuckling at how he wants to be just like us and the obstacles we face as he attempts just that.  And I'm smiling at this picture, case in point...as he's having his morning snack along with the paper.  Just like us."},

I found some inspiration for what I was looking for in the adult version on pinterest, but not even the adult stuff had DIY instructions.  So...I sighed a big sigh and got designing.  And here's what I came up with...  And here it is on our porch...    Here's the instructions on how I made it.  Hey, if I did the work to design it, I can at least share what I did so you won't have to go on a while goose chase in order to make your own, huh?!   1) I used 46 inch width fabric (indoor/outdoor fabric).  Cut a 46 inch by 76 inch rectangle. Lay rectangle out the long way, like an business envelope.  Measure and mark 14 inches in on each side on the top.  Draw a diagonal line from the mark on the top onto the bottom corner.  Cut along diagonal line to make a trapezoid. 2) Finish all edges (serger is perfect).3) Fold and pin every 2ish inches along the diagonal so you have 8 or 10 pleats. 4) Pin 2 adjacent pleats together. Stitch one inch buttonhole through the two pleats (about an inch from the top of the pleat).  Repeat throughout the rest of the pleats.  You'll have 4-5 buttonholes on each side, for which you'll slit so there's a hole. 5) Prepare the support bar. Choose a sturdy scrap wood.  This is ash that was 36 inches in width. Drill hole in each side.  Use \"S\" hook.  Loop \"S\" hook on one side through the pleats and stick the other side of the \"S\" hook through the support bar.6) Attach two \"O\" hooks on top of the support beam.  Attach an \"O\" hook on the ceiling beam.  Thread chain and hang.And then enjoy!  The nice part of it is it's easily removable and washable.  At this point, my 20 month old can either sit or lay in it.  It will last him years, likely.  I can see him curled up in his chair swing reading a chapter book someday.  Here he is trying it out.I'm clearly not talented at taking good pictures of a moving target...especially one who is too busy to pose for his mama.  But anyway, you get the drift.    I guess it's also good for peek-a-boo."},

Dada no no tail.  BOG no no tail.  Dog tail yes.  Cat tail yes.  Pap no no tail.

{"title": "Repairing Diapers", "date": null, "text": "A drawback of velcro diapers is the velcro eventually wears out.  Certainly it's handy to have velcro, as it's easiest to diaper a mover.  I thought I'd add some tips if you're in need of diaper repair. First of all, don't expect it to be a quick project.  It likely took me about 30 minutes per diaper...most of that time ripping out seams.  Not the most fun project, but once done, it's nice to have the diapers in rotation.   Be very careful with the seam ripper, as  you don't want to go too quick and leave holes.  The best way to rip out is on the velcro side.  Slit every 5th stitch.  Then pull the threads on the opposite side and the whole piece should come off in one piece.  It's a great project to keep in the car if you're the passenger.I ended up just re-velcroing because that's what I had in the house.  You can also replace with snaps.  If you do replace with velcro, make sure you use polyester thread.  If you use cotton thread, it's absorbent, and there will be leaks outside of the diaper.A walking foot and a heavy duty needle are helpful for ease in repair. Although my little guy no longer wears diapers during the day, I'll at least be more prepared for baby #2 with 8 more diapers in the rotation."},

{"title": "When did you get so big?!", "date": null, "text": "All of a sudden, seemingly overnight, my 19 month old decided to be big. He puts on his own hat and those beloved boots. He's working at un-dressing himself.  He consistently goes on the potty.  He puts his laundry away. He puts his dishes in the sink. No more taking baths in the little apron front sink, he's graduated to our large single basin sink (so glad we installed this, as our only tub is a deep whirlpool).  He no longer wants to eat in the high chair, it's now the youth chair (the same one my brother and I ate our meals at).  He would much prefer to use the same cups, utensils and dishes as mama and dada.  He's quite the boss, too...telling us exactly what he wants in his little 2 word sentences.    But, you know what...I will not say it's gone too fast.  Of course, everyone would always like for their kids to stay little, but I'd much prefer rejoicing in these new developments rather than mourning in what's lost.  Although it's against my personality, I have really worked hard at slowing things down so I can enjoy him.  It's been all about simplifying things here.  I've always been busy by nature, particularly through high school and college.  However, I decided that I did not want to be that parent who over schedules her kid.  I feel like I have really had a chance to enjoy him thus far, and hopefully I will be able to say the same once baby #2 arrives.Like many mamas out there, I try my hardest to think about what type of parent I want to be and alter what I do based on my vision.  What's my vision?  Simpleness.  Getting back to the basics.  Time together being the utmost importance.  I'm certainly not perfect by any means, but this is what I've done to try to work on keeping things simple, so I can try to enjoy parenthood to the fullest.*  Balancing Outings with Downtime. A full schedule with little breathing room isn't how I want my little one to be raised. I want him to have time to be home and play.  To discover and learn without the pressure of a time schedule.  If we need to be out and about in the morning, we stay close to home in the afternoon.  If we're out and about for much of the day, the next day will be a day just to be at home.  I am learning it's okay to say \"no\".  We don't need to have something planned everyday.  The best days are the days spent home, together. * Less errands.  It's amazing how much time it takes to run those routine errands. We now only grocery shop once every 3ish weeks (fresh fruits/veggies first week and a half, frozen 2nd week and a half).  We limit department store trips to every other month (which saves us oodles as a bonus).  Debt free/cash only living has taught us that there's not much that we need.  Because we've reduced those trips, there's more unscheduled time in our week, every week.* Big batches. If you're a blog reader, you know I make almost everything from scratch.  I almost always double and/or triple every recipe...freezing the extra.  It's not much more work to make larger batches...which can be dug out later.  That way, we're still eating from scratch even when no one feels like cooking. I make one thing a day, but only cook a main meal every 3 days (my family doesn't mind leftovers), The other days I make a dessert, bread, granola bars, yogurt, granola, etc (recipes in the tab at the top).  The time I spend in the kitchen is manageable for my little helper, so it's together time, not something that has to be done.  This kid has likely made more bread in his time than many adults...the pace of bread making is perfect for keeping things simple.* Keeping our home simple.  We don't do TV.  We don't do cell phones.  We avoid toys that have batteries and we have only a couple toys made out of plastic.  We do read a lot.  We garden.  We tend to our animals.  We have almost all wooden, cloth or metal toys that promote learning through experiencing.  We spend lots of time outside, digging in the dirt or going for walks as a family. We spend a bunch of time near the water...which is calming. The simplicity of our home coupled with spending lots of time outside makes our together time comforting. These are just a few of the ideas I've been working on for our family.I'd love to hear if there's any readers out there who are also trying to keep things more simple.  What are your ideas?"},

{"title": "A Pint Size Picnic Table, Mama Made", "date": null, "text": "When it's summer, we eat outside for just about every meal, including breakfast.  We have a full farmer's porch on our house with table and chairs, with a window screen-less for convenient delivery of the meals.  Plus we have the patio out back we installed as well.  Usually breakfast and lunch are on the shaded farmer's porch and dinner is out back...where we can have an occasional fire to toast s'mores after dinner.On those warm days in March when we had a crew over, I was itching to eat outside.  But, we didn't have enough seating in either space to accommodate multiple adults as well as kiddos.  I was dreaming about a space just for the kiddos to sit.  Since I'm too darn cheap to buy anything, I got to work.  Here's my creation:What's awesome about it is that we spent a grand whopping total of $3.00 on lumber. Less than the cost of a cup of coffee.  Everything else is either scraps left over from when our garage was built or scraps from our neighbor's woodworking job.  The drawback of using scraps is when trying to use what you've got, it's very tricky save some time by using a pattern.  I thought of doing this pattern, but then wasn't able to make what I had fit in that pattern.  So, I skipped a pattern, did all the measuring and creating on my own, using our adult picnic table as a guide... and here it is!     Remember, I'm not a carpenter and don't really know what I'm doing.   I'm just either brave enough (or foolish enough) to think that I can create something that is in my mind. Is it perfect?  Nope.  But it's sturdy and functional.  And my little guy loves it. He, of course, thinks it's another train table, like the other one I made him.    But he'll at least stop to give a quick smile. The awesome part of this project is that it was truly a family project.  When my little guy was napping, my husband (willingly!) helped make some cuts.  Most of my projects are completed while my little guy sleeps, but not this one. Since his attention span for filling and dumping dirt in the dumptruck is much longer than mine, I just began my project in close proximity to his construction zone.  What happened is he left his construction site and ended up watching and being most helpful with his mama's project.  We created together: he organized the tools, did some markings, handed nails/screws and informed me whenever I made a mistake or a mess.  And I loved every minute of it.   I think it's a hit."},

{"title": "Our winter rhythm", "date": null, "text": "In many parenting magazines and books that I read, there's a lot of talk about the importance of rituals and routines in the lives of little ones'.  Even though there's quite a bit of hustle bustle going on in my mind, particularly on the days I work, I try to mentally slow myself down, to enjoy the morning with my little guy, to create a sense of predictably for him.I will hold the memories of this winter dear to my heart.  He always wakes up with a \"mama\".  He'll say it once if I move immediately or a whole string of \"mama, mama, mama, mama, mamas\" on the days I'm less eager to arise from hibernation. Our house is always cold in the morning, from the fire petering out.  My little guy decides he must find a hat and/or boots.   I let the dog out and start a fire.  He helps crumple paper.  As we're getting toasty warm, he drags over the monthly book basket and we read a half dozen books.  Such a perfect start before the laundry washing/dishwasher unloading/breakfast making/lunch packing/chicken tending/cat feeding beings.  More days than not, I'll hear \"up mama\" or \"carrier\", as he still likes to be close to his mama (so thankful for baby wearing!).  Lately, I also hear \"mama sit\", a good reminder to not be in such a hurry that I miss out on breakfast with my little guy.  Yes, we go about our morning, just the two of us, of course with my to-do list, but with togetherness being the most important goal.  Soon our mornings will not begin with starting a fire.  Instead, we'll migrate outside to hang the wash on the clothesline.  We'll have our breakfast on the front porch while enjoying the flowers and the chorus of birds.  Just the same that we did last year, although a few toy trucks will likely be joining us at breakfast this year.  There's a magic to the simultaneous newness and familiarity new seasons bring.  And to think, I'll be sharing this winter tradition with two next winter.  How amazing is that?"},

Now, it would be much, much easier to slap a check in an envelope to congratulate, and I know no one would complain about that sort of gift.   But to me, a wedding is a once in a lifetime celebration that deserves handmade attention.   I decided to create monogrammed pillows.  His first initial.  Their last initial.  Her first initial.  Then in the bottom, I embroidered \"est. 00/00/0000\"...their wedding date.  If the bride didn't change her last name, I'd do his first initial.  The '&' sign.  Her first initial.  All were well received and appreciated.  \"How to\" is listed at the bottom.     How I made these (I know there's oodles of ways, this is how I did it).... 1) Choose a font you like on Word.  The middle letter I increased to fit a full page.  The smaller letters I increased so there were two on a page, side by side.  Print. 2) Trace onto double sided fusible interfacing.  Adhere to the fabric of choice with an iron.  Cut out letters.3) Place letters on pillow fabric.  I left 1 1/2 inch border between the letters and the inside seam, 2 inch border for the outside edge and 1/2 inch seam allowance.  Grand total was 4 inches of fabric around the letters.  Cut fabric top.  Iron letters on.  Finish letters with zig zag stitch.   4) Hand embroider \"est.\" and wedding date on front right corner.5) Cut backing the same size as the front.  With right sides together, sew front to back pillows together along edges, remembering to back stitch, using a 1/2 inch seam.  Leave a 3-4 inch gap at the bottom for stuffing.  Sew 2 inches in from the last seam you just did, leaving the same size gap at the bottom.  Turn right side out.  Press.  Top stitch 1/8 from edge, making sure you leave the same size gap at the bottom.6) Stuff the pillow.  Finish the seams by hand or I ended up using  a zipper foot, which worked well.I'd love to see your finished projects if you give it a go! :)"},

I had so many opportunities to watch the two of them together.  It's fun to be a fly on the wall! Now, I know my husband is an awesome dad, but getting to experience the strong bond my son and husband have together, it's just magical.  It's a bond like none other.  Daddy teaches things that I wouldn't think of.  They rough house in a way I do not.  They do push ups and squats together.  They both have interesting dance moves.  They have these unique beat-boxing tunes they sing together.  They think farting is hysterical. They laugh at a lot of things I do not find funny. Again, a different way from mama and baby...but it's oh so magical to witness the bond.  Here's some of what I captured.  My little guy is so fortunate to have a daddy who loves him so.  And I'm so fortunate to have a true partner in parenting, whom I love.I can't wait to see this daddy with his little girl.  Twice the fun! :)"},

Pizza muffins, topped with pineapple, veggies, tomato sauce and cheese (a bit of every food group...and a non-processed snack). This recipe is so immense that there was enough for all of these ideas.  A whole tray of pre-made pizza muffins has been a big hit, husband approved.

Stitch up the three sides.  Turn and hem the open edge. Easy!  I added appliqued fish to the side.  I appliqued the old fashioned way...pressing the seams in.  I'm reminded why I don't do that too often.  I also embroidered little bubbles, look closely and you can see them.I'm hoping since my little guy is into fish (which he signs with an open/closed mouth motion as he points to each fish in the fabric) that he'll be excited about sleeping on this pillow.  He has been thinking nighttime sleeping is unnecessary lately, maybe this will change his mind?  At least I get a few extra snuggles with a little guy who thinks sleeping is optional.  I do love snuggles.

I remember how she put the light on in the oven, so I could watch my creation bake.I, remember pretending to be my mom, creating with her pots and pans, particularly while she cleaned up (who really wants to help clean up anyway?).  I smile when my little guy asks for a \"spoon\".

The more obnoxious the noise is, the bigger my smile. While some may think these memories would bring me sadness (my mom passed away when I was 15), it's actually the contrary.  I smile thinking of all those wonderful memories.  I'd rather have 15 years of a fantastic mom rather than a lifetime of a mediocre mother.

Save the parts you cut off for another use.  Place one round on your serving platter or cake plate.  Top with half of the filling mixture and spread evenly.  Top with the other cake round.Now use the reaming filling to fill in the center filling section of the cake so that the filling layer is completely even with the cake layers.  You may not need all of the filling.  Then cover the top and sides of the cake with the chocolate frosting.  You may have some leftover frosting."},

What we did:-removed top cabinets, moved to the ceiling, added trim-sanded, primed and painted the cabinets-added new knobs and handles -removed the old hood fan, added a new one and a shelf-left off one cabinet and put up open shelves-replaced the sink with a single huge basin (BEST DECISION EVER!)-added a new faucet  -wainscoting backsplash (my brother did this)-added butcher block wooden countertops (LOVE THEM!)-added an island table and chairs for free (must blog about how I did this....quite the project!)The only thing we didn't do was install the countertops and sink.  All else was us.  Add some homemade cinnamon raisin bread (must blog) and a coconut cream cake and you've got a cozy kitchen.  Someday, we'd like to add matching appliances and slate floor.  But not an emergency.Cost breakdown:$1350 for all supplies (including countertops, hood fan, knobs and handles, paint/paint supplies, wainscoting, trim, shelving, faucet and sink) $300 for labor to install the countertops and sinkWe are SUPER happy with how much brighter it is.  It is so much more \"us\".  Well worth the effort."},

{"title": "Family Time in the Woods", "date": null, "text": "Maybe it's this pregnancy and the crazy hormones, but I have been counting my blessings a lot lately.  It's awesome to be married to such a great man.   We have had an awesome marriage, almost 6 years.  Life before being parents was fabulous.  We always have wanted to spend every second together, we were great communicators and hardly had any conflict.  He was my knight and shining armor through the whole birth.  I am confident I would not have had a drug free birth if he wasn't there.  He was so supportive that I didn't need any drugs, his comforting words and touch were all I needed.  What we both were not prepared for was the very first big challenge in our marriage after bringing a baby home. Wow, it was hard at first and we didn't expect it in the least.  I think the biggest part was me.  I was beat up from delivery, had too much adrenaline to sleep for days, we had some medical issues with the baby (that seemed major at the time, but really were quite minor), I was dealing with nursing issues and taking care of the baby 24/7, not to mention crazy hormonal changes. I had many expectations that I was either not saying aloud or saying once frustrated.  I think I was resentful because it seemed that his life went about as normal, whereas mine had changed completely.  I felt like I was flying solo and he was just hanging around on vacation.  Now, my husband is a caring, loving and helpful guy.  It's not like he was being lazy.  I think he didn't know where to help, wasn't sure how to help and didn't have the confidence to think he could do it.  Now, prior to the baby, we would have just sat and discussed this, but for some reason, we just were having a hard time pulling together.  I never had postpartum depression, I had postpartum frustration towards my husband.  Poor guy.Why am I writing about this?  Because from articles in parenting magazines, personal accounts from friends and word of mouth stories, it's so common.  I've read three articles in the last couple months about the strains a marriage faces after a new baby.  It's real.  Even for rock solid couples, like us. This time around, we're going to talk about expectations, roles and plans ahead of time.  We're going to try our best to prepare and hopefully avoid a potential roller coaster.But, you know what's awesome?  After the hormones settled down, we're back to being us.  Really, it is quite awesome that we've only had one challenge in almost 6 years of marriage. And the challenge wasn't a \"let's divorce\" type, it was more like \"I'm not making dessert for you because I'm mad\" type of situation (never has that happened before!). My husband is an awesome husband and dad.  Awesome beyond words.  We are united as parents.  We think as a team, we back each other up and we're on the same page.  We get along really well.  We love being together and miss each other when we're gone. We laugh together.  We pray together.  We eat dessert together. We talk and talk and talk some more (wait, that's me who does the talking...).  He's my one and only, my very best friend and my life long partner. I can't imagine my life without him.  I cherish the times we spend together,especially family time with just us, such as long walks in the woods pictured below.  I feel so blessed!"},

Well, our little one fell in love with a train table at the restaurant we ate at.  I suggested to my husband that we should make one later that night.  I think he rolled his eyes at me, although he'd never admit it.  I'm good for my word (much to his chagrin).  He did volunteer to help...which amounted to 2 cuts and a few screws. Then he gave up and watched.  He doesn't like to get involved in my crazy ideas, so he says. The whole table is made entirely from scrap wood I found around our garage, paint, nails and screws we had. It cost nothing to make.  It was free.  F-R-E-E.  Those four little letters create that word that sounds off the Hallelujah chorus in my head.  Oh, how I love free. You can make one too with found scraps!   *  The legs are 8 equal length pieces of 2x 4s.  Two are nailed together at a right angles to make the legs.  You can make them whatever length you'd like, as long as they're even. Ours are 18 in. high.*  The top is just a random board.  You can use whatever size you've got.  Ours is  36x45 inches.I screwed the table legs to the corners of the top board, matching right angles.* The sides are trim pieces that were removed from the basement when we added extra baseboard heating. They're 4 1/2 inches wide.  I measured the side lengths and cut them to match the length of the table.  I screwed them to the legs and the board, making sure there was a 1 1/2 inch lip above the top board (to catch random fly away trains).  Last, I measured how long the end pieces needed to be, cut and screwed them.*Paint and you're done. Believe it or not, it only took a couple hours to make. The priming and painting took a bit of time between dries.  But it was finished in a couple days.    Is it perfect?  Nope. Are the corners mitered?  Nope. Are all the screw holes perfect?  Don't look too close.Could it use an extra coat of paint? Yup. Would I be embarrassed for a woodworker to inspect it? Um, yes.  But....Is it solid?  Very.Is it functional? Definitely.Is it well loved already?  Oh yes.   Does it make a mama happy just watching her little angel loving it so?  Oh yes. Ohh!  Oooo!  Ohhh! Oooo!

Upon initial notice, someone was amazed, hardly blinked.  But soon the dancing and commenced.  It's really a quite remarkable show.    And to think I caught it blinking (between this picture and the next).  Such a selfless commitment creating this show and greeting each person who comes the whole month of December.  This family has really succeeded in teaching their children what Christmas is all about.  Inspiring."},

Well, I have been wanting to make some props to go along with the song.  I came across this pattern on the blog 'homemade by jill'.  I loved her blog and her little monkeys!  Here's mine:     Her alligator is super cute too, but I was envisioning a bigger puppet that would chow the monkeys (those poor monkeys!). I set to work and designed an alligator puppet.  (I swear the back of the neck doesn't look funny in person...I lose points for poor prep work before taking the picture.  That's what I get with a toddler pulling at my pant legs).  My little one LOVES it!  He brings it to me all the time.  I played it with another dozen kiddos at work, and they all loved it too.  And they ask for it to come back (as I've been leaving it at home for my little guy).  Definitely a hit!   Keep reading....here's your  Free Pattern. And here's the instructions (Seam allowances included for 1/4 inch seams and I used a thicker canvas type material for the alligator): 1) Cut out all pattern pieces, mark the X in particular.  With close zig zag stitch, make the eye ball in the middle of the alligator eyes and make the noses.  Applique the eye on the Alligator Face. 2) Pin the alligator top to piece above, right sides together, starting at bottom left, going up and around, and finishing at bottom right.  With pins, ease around the curves.  Stitch in place.   The very bottom of the edge will not be stitched.  3) Repeat same process with the other side of the alligator face. Turn right side out and press. 4) Place 4 strips of batting that are about the dimension to the top of the alligator's jaw (doesn't need to be perfect).   Stitch it in place as shown.   You now have the alligator head. Turn wrong side out again. 4) Fold on the alligator teeth pieces on diagonal twice to make a triangle.  Baste bottom edge in place. Make 8.   4) Pin the pink alligator tongue piece and to the front half of the alligator head, right sides together.  Important:  The fold of the alligator tongue must be pinned at the X on the alligator head.  Add half of the teeth, pinning between the two layers (I did two teeth on top, one on each side). Stitch in place, beginning and ending at the X.  5) Pin bottom jaw of alligator on the bottom portion of the alligator tongue.  Right sides together.  Place remaining teeth in between the two layers before stitching (again, I did two on the bottom, one on each side). turn right side out and press. 6) Pin the alligator neck to the alligator head.   Start with the fold of the neck in the middle of the alligator jaw and pin around to the back. It's okay the pieces don't line up perfectly, we'll take care of that in the next step.   Now, this is the trickiest part out of the whole project, as you have to stitch around the edge, being careful to not sew the alligator mouth shut.    7) Pin the back of the alligator head together, right sides together.  Gather the remaining fabric from the back of the head of the alligator and pin.  Stitch a dart at an angle from the head of the alligator, continuing on to finish the alligator neck seam.  Hem the bottom of the alligator neck.  Press.  I stuffed a bit of stuffing in the alligator's eyes  to make them stand out better (the dart helps keep it in the right place).   And there you have it:Happy crafting!  Let me know if you give it a go...I'd love any feedback, as I'm new to creating patterns.This project joins my others for a naptime song bag project:Remember that Naptime Bag project I was working on?  Well, here's the latest softie.

In my adult life, I had one tell me that they looked forward to seeing us in our costumes every year.  Can't get a better compliment than that!  When I was a teen, my best friends and I all dressed as a theme.  We carried out the same tradition, visiting those elderly folks who never got trick or treaters.  We'd show up all dressed as Winnie the Pooh, Wizard of Oz, Snow White and her Dwarfs, singing the theme song.  Certainly a highlight.  Instead of viewing Halloween as an event to avoid, I embrace it, will let my child get dressed in cute costumes and use the day to do good for others.Here's what we did this year:Hat was made by my pal at Bug a Boo Beanies.  The shirt was a onesie with spots sewed on by mama.  There was a bell around the neck that was sometimes there, sometimes chucked across the room.

With right sides together, pin that piece to one of the bus sides, starting and ending at the X. With pins, ease the fabric in around the curves.  Stitch very carefully.  Repeat same step with other bus side.  Now the upper portion of the bus is complete. 4) Pin right sides together of bus bottom to upper portion of the bus.  Stitch, leaving a ~3 inch opening. 5) Turn bus right side out. Press. Fill with stuffing.  Hand stitch to close.6) (See pictures). With each wheel, baste 1/4 of an inch from edge, do not backstitch at either end.  Leave long threads loose.  If you want, you can stitch an 1/8 inch as well (just in case your thread breaks, you won't need to go back to square one).  Holding one end of the thread, pull the opposite side to gather the seam.  Hold the other end of the string and do the same.  You may need to pinch and pull fabric to ease the seam in gathering.  It should gather into a circle.  Hand stitch the wheels in place.  Add an hand applique license, if desired.Don't forget to let me know if you think you will try this and how it goes if you do!  Like I said, if there's interest, I'll keep my patterns coming.  Thanks for reading!"},

{"title": "Cloth Diaper Detergent and Upcycled Canister", "date": null, "text": "I've been asked what I use to wash our cloth diapers, so I decided to blog about it.  I got this recipe from the eco friendly family blog.  Decided to give it a try.  It works, it's cheap and super easy to make. Here's what's in it: And I wrote the washing instructions for daddy...who claims he can never remember how to wash them, so he leaves it for me to do.  Right.  Love that man anyway!!!  If you're interested in why we don't have poppy diapers, see below *. And the canister?  It's a formula container (see explanation below**).  I just washed it out, decoupaged paper on it, wrote on the canister and then decoupaged a top layer to protect it.   I must say, it looks pretty snazzy! Onto the explanations....  This is probably sharing too much information, so skip if you don't want to be too well informed.  * We don't have poppy diapers hardly at all.  Because our little one poops in the potty and has since he was 5 months old.  You think I'm crazy, but he does.  Since I'm a speech-language pathologist, I specialize in reading communication.  At 2 weeks of age, I always knew when my little one was pooping.  I thought again and again about why I was waiting for him to poop and then cleaning it up?  Besides, isn't going on the potty what 3rd world countries who don't have diapers have to do? Finally, I decided to put him on the potty when I knew.  And it worked.  By 5 months, he was pooping on the potty all the time.  I looked it up on the internet to see if anyone else was doing this.  What do you know?  It's called Elimination Communication.  I read this book and learned that I can train him to pee on the potty too.  Most days, he pees on the potty at least half the time.  Sometimes he makes it through a whole day without any misses.  Sometimes he gets up in the night to potty.  He often makes it though naps dry and goes potty when he wakes up.  He often goes 8 hours at night dry and he always goes potty when he first wakes up.  He likes dry diapers, so when we're out and about, he often appreciates a chance to pee.  We don't make him go...we follow his lead (daddy's fully on board too).  It was the first way we really communicated with each other.  I think it's helped us read him better and taught him the value of his communication earlier on.  It's been awesome for us.** I'm finally ready to talk a little about my breastfeeding challenges and why I had to use formula.  (Disclaimer...I'm certainly not judging anyone's choices/reasons for formula feeding. This is just a reflection of me...and what was important to me.  I support any which way a mama cares for her little one, without judgment.)   It's been quite the road for me, but hopefully I can inspire someone to continue. I was set on being an exclusive breast feeder.  Committed.  Excited.  But, we had a sick little boy a few days after he was born.  I wasn't making anything but a drop or two at a time.  He was losing weight, a lot.  I was in denial.  I sobbed big sobs when I had to start formula.  I mourned a death when I had to go get more bottles.  I was told that I could breastfeed for 'fun', but it wouldn't be to feed my baby.  More big sobs.  But, I didn't give up.  I still kept breastfeeding him around the clock for 'fun'.  I began researching and taking oodles of homeopathic remedies...up to 14 various all natural supplements a day (More Milk Plus, Mother's Milk Tea, Fenugreek, Oatmeal, Brewer's Yeast).  And guess what?!  My milk came in when he was 4 weeks old!  Not much, but none the less, it was some.  I made about an ounce every three hours at my peak.  I was elated.  And re-committed to giving my baby every ounce I could.  I joyfully got up in the middle of the night.  I pumped when I was at work, until he was 6 months old.  I surprised even the lactation consultations.  He's 13 months and still nurses 2-3 times a day.  Although I never gave him much in one feeding, I'm so proud of myself and so thankful that the amount I have given him over time is quite a bit.  Tears of joy are streaming down my face at this moment because I am so darn happy that I was able to do what I did. Thank you, God.  My dad, a veterinarian, told me that this problem happens a lot with cows-sometimes the milk doesn't come in with the first calf, but you wait around until the 2nd calf before sending her to slaughter.  Always an interesting perspective being compared to livestock, but that's my dad.  Fingers crossed that my milk will come in for my next calf, so I don't have to be slaughtered.  There's hope. :)"},

I just don't have freezer space.  So...I decided to invest in canning supplies.  I have helped my grandmother in the past with canning, but I'd still consider myself a beginner.  I looked and looked online for the $50+ starter kits.  I just couldn't bring myself to spend that much $$$ on just the supplies for canning.  Plus the books, I wanted a good one.  I ended up doing a bit of a mix and max and ended up with everything I need and only spent $16.  How?  I bought a large lobster pot at a thrift store (which is easy to come by living in Maine).  I bought  the jar lifter and the canning rack from amazon, they were on sale for $10 combined.  I found a canning funnel, similar to this, used.  I found http://www.pickyourown.org/allaboutcanning.htm in lieu of a book. It's a fantastic resource to tell you everything you need about canning.  Now how to get stuff to can?  Well, you can grow it, go to a pick your own farm or farmer's markets.  Those are the obvious choices.  Or you can be like me, and ask your neighbors.  I have some wonderful neighbors who have some fruit trees.  I've noticed that the years we live here that not all the fruit was used.  I asked if they would be willing to share.  And you know what?  They're thrilled that someone can use it and it's not going to waste. Look around old farmhouses in particular.  Sometimes there's a half of a dozen old apple trees with apples not being used.  Ask!  The worst someone can say is no.  They may be thrilled that it won't go to waste too.These are from our good neighbors who have become our friends.  I picked a laundry basket full and barely touched the mass amount on the pear tree.  I maybe took 1/10th...and look at the crop! Beautiful.  All I do is cut the tops and bottoms off, cut them in half and boil until fork tender.  These are hard so it takes about an hour.  Then I pop them in whole in my kitchen aid using the fruit strainer attachment (which is worth it's weight in gold when making this stuff). Then I can according to the directions on the website referenced above.  And I receive constant supervision from my sous chef.  He spends a lot of time sitting in the canning boxes.  And stepping in and out of them (as he is here).

And I'm *trying* to be thankful into the evening, as I'm in the midst of preserving.   Won't you join me and begin Thanksgiving early this year?"},

{"title": "Baking Station", "date": null, "text": "I've had a number of people ask me \"How do you do all of that baking?\".  Well, my first answer is that I like to eat what I bake. Eating gives me motivation to bake, for sure. Second, I have a baking station all set up, so I can just grab and bake without needing to gather what I need. I have a 1919 Sellers Hoosier Cabinet. Back in the day, these were made to help the 'housewife' with her duties.  It actually says in mine:  \"To the housewife:   Thank you for buying our product.  We've endeavored to make it good looking, serviceable and convenient, so as to greatly reduce your labor in the kitchen so you have time to devote to your other daily affairs\".  I definitely don't consider myself a \"housewife\", and if my husband ever referred to me as such, well, he may lose an appendage. I am very domestic, but it's because I want to be, not because it's expected of me.  And much of the reason why I want to be domestic is so I can feed my sugar tooth.  Regardless, I get a kick out of the old fashioned wording and appreciate the concept of organizing baking supplies for convenience and time efficiency purposes.    .The hoosier has all of my ingredients in the top and side cabinets (holds 50 pounds of flour!); measuring cups, sptaulas and wooden spoons in the drawers; as well as cookbooks and bowls under the accordion.  There's a cutting board that pulls out.  The enamel top pulls out to double the size, which is perfect for pie making.  I keep my kitchen aid permanently on a movable cart adjacent to the hoosier.  The cart contains napkins, aprons and additional baking dishes.  My dad made me a cabinet to store additional spices.  I actually use the antique pottery on top (Robinson Ransbottom Blue Stripe Pottery, Roseville Ohio) as well.  There's a working, antique reproduction phone next to the Hoosier.  In case of a baking disaster, I can phone a friend. :)So, I share this not because I want you all to jet out to go antiquing, in hopes of finding the perfect Hoosier cabinet.  Instead, I was hoping I'd inspire you to dig out a space of your kitchen and organize it to be your baking nook.  Having everything handy makes baking a breeze."},

But then, if you're like me, you cut the bars and half of the bar sticks to your knife.  Well, there's a solution to that.  Keep a plastic knife in your drawer.  Plastic doesn't conduct heat like a metal knife.  Therefore, you can cut whatever you'd like and not have the chunks of bars sticking to the knife.  Now you don't have to wait so long to consume those delicious calories.  Mmm."},

Turn right side out. Press.  3) Measure desired skirt length,leaving room for bottom hem.  Width is 2 to 2 1/2 times bodice.  Hem sides of skirt.  Baste entire length of skirt 1/2 inch in on top leaving ends loose.  Pull threads to gather and make a ruffle.  You may need to pinch and move gather to ease it all in.  4) Place right sides of bottom skirt and bodice together so ruffle matches.  Stitch in place.  Press.  4)Cut long ribbon 3 1/2 to 4 times the length of the bodice.  Pin the middle of the long ribbon to the back of the bodice, covering the unfinished stitches.  Stitch (one side of the ribbon stitch in the ditch the other side of the ribbon hand sew so you can't see through the apron).

First and foremost, I must preface this by saying I know it's much easier to buy pie crusts.  But that's not how I roll.  I also realize this isn't the healthiest version of pie crust one can make.  But you know what?  I don't care.  The reason being is this is the pie crust my mom always made, straight from the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook. That red plaid book always makes me think of those days where I'd pull a chair up to the counter.  I had my own red measuring cups as a kid that may have dirtied a few pages of that cookbook. We'd be covered in flour, but laughing, talking and smiling.  So, no, I will not make a healthier version, as this one is healthy for my soul. And it tastes good.My Double Pie Crust, adapted from the Red Plaid Book of Memories:2 1/4 cup flour1 tsp salt2/3 cup shorteningabout 1/4 cup iced water (prepare more, in case you need it, have the iced water chilling while you're doing the other steps)1) Place flour, salt and shortening in bowl.  Proceed to cut the shortening into the flour.I use a Cuisinart  Food Processorto make ours.  I pulse the contents until it resembles tiny balls.  You can also use a pastry blender to get the same results. 2) Gradually add the water in, continue to pulse or blend until the dough resembles the picture.  If the dough is too dry, it will be very tricky to roll out.3) Dip your hands in flour and form into a firm ball.  Place on a surface dusted with flour and cut into two equal parts (I'm in love with our pastry scraper to help with all these steps). 4) Roll the half into another small ball.  With the side of your hand, press three indents intents one way, and then the otherway. It should look like tick tack toe.5) Sprinkle with flour and roll with your rolling pin, into a circle that's big enough for your pie dish.6) Fold into quarters.  I usually lift with my pastry scraper  Place in pie plate and open.  7) Fill pie with contents.  Roll out other crust and place it as the top layer on in the same way you placed the base layer on.8) Tuck, squeeze and scallop the edges with your hands, or you can use a fork.  Poke a hole or two in the top so it can breathe. Bake.  Often pies are 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes.  Enjoy!"},

Really, my husband is a great sport at using re-usable containers, even though they've termed him \"Officer Tupperware\" at work.  When he's working overtime, there's just not enough room in his lunchbox to carry all of his treats in 'tupperware'.  So, I whipped these up for him.  Yes, they're not perfect, but in a quick 10 minutes, he was able to bring his crackers to work in a little handy sack.  I am positive I am way more excited about this than he.

This daddy has mastered cloth diapering by choice. He sports a coordinating Halloween costume. A tiny pureed smoothie to match daddy's is made special his for his little lunch date. An afternoon hike just for the boys is exactly what his baby loves.  Creative songs, games, dances and play routines keep this little boy giggling and learning.   There's a calm confidence about this daddy that his baby finds so reassuring.  Taking care of his baby is never 'work', it's always out of love.  He never complains about his sweet little boy.  While this baby doesn't always match, our little angel knows he is loved by both his mama and daddy.This mama has captured some of the sweet moments between this strong man and his little love.  Moments where my heart melts and my eyes become puddled.  Moments that make me forget about our trivial grown up squabbles about household chores.  Moments where I admire, appreciate and cherish this man who has chosen me as his wife.  Moments where I'm so incredibly thankful that I went on that blind date in 2004.  Moments where I look at my little family and think \"Life cannot possibly be any better than this\".  But you know what?  Life is getting better.  Everyday that I watch my husband father our little guy, I fall even more in love with him.  This life is even better than that what I've dreamed.  I am so blessed.Happy Father's Day to the man I love."},

That idea was quickly rejected.  Just was I had claimed defeat, our neighbors/friends made a generous offer.  A community garden with them.  At their historic home across the way.  We were ecstatic.  Well, I was ecstatic.  My husband was worried...worried about what his ambitious wife would sign him up for.Year 1 of gardening turned out better than I hoped.  Although my dear husband dragged his feet, he did help the large pregnant mama-to-be last summer.  Even while being pregnant and with an infant, I was able to grow and preserve enough food for our baby to be raised on homemade baby food and for many home grown winter meals.  There's something special about wandering to Nam and Pap's house on warm summer evenings, tending the growing plants, watching the beautiful sunset and engaging in conversation with friends we are so thankful for.  Yes, I was quite frustrated that we haven't had any luck gardening our land.  But, my lack of success turned into a blessing, for gardening with Nam and Pap is 10x better than gardening solo.On my way to Nam and Pap's. Our seedlings are always small with limited light at first, but they'll take off.This is Penny Road, the old dirt road that passes the old parsonage on the way to Nam and Pap's. Freshly rototilled by Pap. The beginnings of our planting.New life. We play 'Where's Kammie?

I often slice the onions and set aside until a meal time.  I’ll let the onions caramelize while we're eating to maximize time.  I’ll add the remaining ingredients after the meal and let the soup simmer.

I hid the free sign and ran home as fast as my legs would carry me.  I got my car and had 2/3 pieces moved into my apartment by 7am.  And my brother was on his way with his bigger vehicle to help me get the one piece that didn't fit in my car.  Of course many of people would think I was crazy, but my brother is fully used to my impulsive ideas and instead of questioning me, he promptly veered into the kitchen for dessert for breakfast.Not  the best of all pictures, but this picture makes me happy because all  three of our cats and our dog are all together.  The one next to me is  our dear 17 year old cat, Dusty, who we said goodbye to last year.  We  miss him dearly.I cleaned up the piece and it had great bones!  I purchased foam cushions and cut them to fit the seats.  I covered them with plaid fabric.  I then covered pillows from around my apt (and one from a thrift shop) to match. I even made a homemade ruffle for 3 of the pillows by basting and pulling threads.  I then made a placemat to match with the scraps.  And would you believe I have this whole set for around $30?  Score.Oh, and I also found the rod iron lamp on the side of the road.  Just a light bulb and a lamp shade and it's perfect.  Not bad for free.  As my dad says, \"free\" is his favorite four letter word that begins with /f/.  I'd have to agree."},

{"title": "Homemade Laundry Soap", "date": null, "text": "Okay, so I know fully that some of you will deem me crazy with this post.  Really?  Homemade laundry soap? Why the hassle?  Does it really work?I've been wanting to try to make laundry detergent for a long time.  But then I think...I always buy laundry detergent with a coupon, so it's not really that expensive. And I always think, if I go through an extensive labor in the kitchen, then I'd like to be able to eat it.Just randomly today, as I was shopping for laundry detergent, I decided I would give making it a go.  I also picked up some commercial detergent in case my idea backfired.  In typical Jackie fashion, I don't just give a recipe a try.  Instead, I devise my own through researching.  I perused the internet, looking for examples of ideas.  I consulted 10 different recipes and then hid them all and devised my own, using ivory soap (which creates a bit of nostalgia for me, as my grandparents used ivory soap for guests at their Blue Top Motel).  Here's what I did:Jackie's Homemade Laundry Detergent3 1/2 gallons water1 bar of ivory soap 3/4 cup washing soda3/4 cup borax1) Bring 1/2 gallon of water to a boil.2) Grate the soap.  I used my kitchen aid grader attachment.3) Wisk in the soap in the boiling water.  Simmer until completely dissolved.4) Add the washing soda and borax.  Wisk until dissolved.5) Add it to 3 gallons of hot tap water (I had the 3 gallons of water waiting in a 5 gallon bucket).  Stir.6) Divvy up the detergent into smaller canisters if desired.  Let set before use (it turns into a gel). Use 1/2 cup of detergent for each load of laundry, 1/4 cup for HE washers.Verdict:This was very, very easy.  Took 35 minutes from start to completion, and I was doing other things around the house while making it. And like with most things, the more you do it, the quicker you get at making it.  And I think it works great!  And as an added bonus, all of the supplies come in paper packaging.  No extra plastic will need to be manufactured for our laundry needs from this point forward.  How cool is that?! Note...it does separate.  You can prevent much separating by mixing it with a burr mixer once set. You can also throw a few marbles in the container and mix it up by shaking or  1/4 cup  of gel and then one 1/4 cup of liquid per load. I've also used it for spot treatment...dipping the  area that got a spot on it in the liquid to pre treat it before washing. I hope you're as impressed as I am with the results. Cost:  I spent $9.51 for all the supplies, and I can make 3 gallons of detergent 10 times with what I bought.  Since I am a nerd, I did the math.  That will equal 3840 loads of laundry, costing less than a quarter of a penny a load.  Compare that with low to high end commercially available products- Purex was $0.20 load; Tide was $0.30 load.  If you do one load of laundry a day for a year, making your own will save you a minimum of $70-$105.  Needless to say, I will be returning the $8.00 commercial laundry detergent that I bought."},

My dad has an obsession with Maple Syrup.  He has it pretty much everyday.  On grapefruit, oatmeal, on ice cream, sweet potatoes, squash, in yogurt, etc. He always  is asking me to make the maple cake his mom used to make.  When he runs out of ideas on what to have maple syrup on, he digs out the shot glass and has a shot.  The first time my husband observed this, it was quite entertaining.  My husband's eyes were wide in disbelief as my dad poured a shot for him.  While I was visiting my dad during my maternity leave, I pondered putting two of my dad's favorite foods together:  Maple and Chocolate Chip Cookies.  I began playing in the kitchen, trying to create the perfect recipe.  These were approved with gusto.  And then I get asked when I'm going to be making them again. Maple Chocolate Chip Cookies-a jackie lipsky original1 cup butter1 cup brown sugar1/2 cup maple syrup2 eggs2 tsp baking soda1 tsp vanilla1 tsp salt1 tsp cinnamon2 cup oats1 cup whole wheat flour1 1/2 cup white flour1 cup coconut2 cup choc chips1 cup nuts (pecans go best)Cream butter, sugars and eggs.  Add the rest of the ingredients in sequence, mixing as you go.  Drop on greased cookie sheets.  Bake 375 for 10-12 minutes.  Mmm."},

Wear your mud boots. Bring home a fresh  jug of maple syrup.  A perfect country day.  So, in keeping with the  festivities, today needs to be a maple post. There's nothing like getting a sample of maple syrup fresh from the sugarbush.And we are the terrible parents who let their baby try sweet maple syrup for the very first time.  I mean if we're enjoying it, he should get a chance too, right?! We enjoyed the animals.And loved our pancakes.Of course we bought some maple syrup to bring home.  Yum!"},

And the cool part is one set of suspenders makes 4 clips for your baby.  It's handy to clip a couple of toys at a time in contraptions like the stroller.Cost for pacifier clips:  $5 in the stores.Cost for mine:  I got the suspenders at a thrift shop for $1.  Which makes 4 pacifier clips.  So $.25 a piece.  Baby approved.And the cat would love to get his paws on one too."},

{"title": "Bread Bag", "date": null, "text": "I whipped up a quick bag to keep my bread along with my cutting board in.  That way we're not wasting plastic or foil and it's quick and convenient to slice. It's made out of  PUL, which is a type of plastic used to make diapers often.  I know PUL isn't FDA approved for food, but there's also lots of debate whether or not plastic baggies and ziplock bags are really food safe too. Pretty much it seems like a no win battle, I think. So we end up wrapping the loaf of bread in a cheese cloth and popping it in this bag so it keeps the air out.  At least we're not throwing plastic away...but there needs to be more food safe, air tight options in my opinion.On a positive, the design works perfect!  The bottom is 6 inch square.  The 4 sides are 16 x6 inch rectangles.  I sewed it up, leaving the top side open.  I turned the top side over and hemmed.  There's a soft side 3 inch velcro midway on the bag.  There's a1 inch scratchy velcro on the opposite side of where the soft side velcro is, placed on the hem.  You can fold over twice to securely close the bag, so it's air tight. Sometimes I can fit 2 loaves of bread in it and freeze it. A tight fold secured by velcro."},
