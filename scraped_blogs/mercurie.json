{"title": "The 110th Birthday of Batman Co-Creator Bill Finger", "date": "Thursday, February 8, 2024", "text": "Chances are good that unless you are a comic book fan, you have never heard of Bill Finger. Despite this, it seems very likely that you have heard of his most famous creation, Batman. While for much of his life artist Bob Kane took sole credit for the creation of Batman and his mythos, in truth it was Bill Finger who did most of the work in the creation of the Dark Knight. Indeed, Bill Finger even came up with what is now Batman's most famous nickname, \"the Dark Knight.\"Milton \"Bill\" Finger was born on February 8 1914 in Denver, Colorado. His family moved to The Bronx, New York City. Bill Finger attended DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx and graduated from there in 1933. Following his graduation. he worked as a part-time shoe salesman and aspired to be a writer. He met artist Bob Kane at a party in 1938 and Kane offered him a job ghost writing the comic book features Rusty and His Pals and Clip Carson.Following the huge success that National Comics experienced with Superman, the company wanted similar characters. Bob Kane then came up with the idea for a character called \"The Bat-Man.\" Bob Kane then had Bill Finger meet him at his apartment where he showed Mr. Finger a drawing of a character in reddish tights, boots, and a small domino mask. The character wore no gloves. Affixed to the character's back were two stiff, bat wings. Beneath the drawing in large letters was \"Batman.\" Bill Finger made several suggestions to Bob Kane, including a cowl with pointed bat ears, a scalloped cape, and gloves, as well as a darker colour scheme for the costume. Bill Finger's contributions to the character of Batman would not end there. It was Bill Finger who developed the secret identity of Batman, that of playboy Bruce Wayne. He took the first name from Robert the Bruce, King of the Scots from 1306 to 1329, and the last name from Revolutionary War hero and Founding Father Mad Anthony Wayne. Despite the considerable contributions Bill Finger made to the creation of Batman, when Bob Kane took The Bat-Man to editor Vin Sullivan, he made no mention of Bill Finger or the part he played the character's creation. Bob Kane's contract with Detective Comics Inc. gave Kane sole credit for the creation of Batman, and his signature would appear on every Batman story even when he did not do the art (and, more often than not, the art would be done by such ghost artists as Jerry Robinson, Dick Sprang, and Shelly Moldoff). When Bob Kane renegotiated his contract in 1946, he did not bother to mention Bill Finger either. What is more, Kane's second contract was even more lucrative than his first. It returned partial ownership of Batman to Bob Kane and included rights of reversion and the ability to veto the sale of Batman to any other company. The contract also guaranteed him a specific number of pages per month at what was then an incredible page rate, as well as a percentage of subsidiary rights.  As to Bill Finger who had done the heavy lifting in creating Batman, all he ever received was his usual page rate.The fact is that while Bob Kane received the credit and the money for creating Batman, it was Bill Finger who shaped the character as we know him. It seems likely it was Bill Finger who came up with Batman's origin, in which Bruce Wayne's parents are murdered.  He created the character of Commissioner Gordon, who appeared in the very first panel of the very first Batman story. He gave Gotham City its name. He created or co-created the characters of Robin, The Joker, Catwoman, The Riddler, and many of Batman's other villains. It was Bill Finger who gave Gotham City its name.While Bill Finger co-created Batman and created much of the character's mythos, he also created other comic book characters. He scripted the early stories of the Golden Age Green Lantern, Alan Scott, and is sometimes credited as co-creator with Martin Nodell. He created the character of Wildcat, with the character's costume designed by artist Irwin Hasen. With artist John Sikela he created Lana Lang, the love interest of Superboy. All three of these characters would have a lasting impact and still appear in the pages of DC Comics titles.It would take years for Bill Finger to receive recognition as the co-creator of Batman, and Bob Kane continued to insist that he was the sole creator the character even after considerable evidence had emerged about Bill Finger's contributions. It was in 1965 comic book fan and scholar Jerry Bails wrote an article, published in CAPA-Alpha no. 12 (September 1965), that recognized Bill Finger as the co-creator of Batman. As might be expected, Bob Kane strenuously denied the facts in the article. In the following years Bill Finger was increasingly recognized as the co-creator of Batman in comic book fandom. Even late in his life Bob Kane would acknowledge the considerable contributions that Bill Finger made to the Caped Crusader. In his biography Batman and Me, Bob Kane wrote, \"Now that my long-time friend and collaborator is gone, I must admit that Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved. He was an unsung hero ... I often tell my wife, if I could go back fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say. 'I'll put your name on it now. You deserve it.'\"Even after it was generally accepted that Bill Finger co-created Batman, it would be years before he would be credited as such by DC Comics. It was in 2006 that author Marc Tyler Nobleman began researching Bill Finger's role in the creation of Batman for a non-fiction picture book. Marc Tyler Nobleman uncovered the fact that Bill Finger's son Fred had a daughter, Athena Finger. He contacted Athena Finger and encouraged her to get in touch with DC Comics in order to get credit for Bill Finger as Batman's co-creator. His biography of Bill Finger, Bill the Boy Wonder: The Secret Co-Creator of Batman was published in 2012. It was in 2017, following negotiations with Bill Finger's granddaughter Athena Finger, that DC Entertainment began crediting Bill Finger. In movies Bill Finger was first credited as the co-creator of Batman in the movie Batman v. Superman: The Dawn of Justice (2016). In television he was first credited as the co-creator of Batman on the second season of Gotham. In 2017 a documentary about Marc Tyler Nobleman's research and his efforts to get recognition for Bill Finger, Batman & Bill, premiered on Hulu. Sadly, Bill Finger died on January 18 1974 when he was only 59, so he never lived to see the recognition he would receive as the co-creator of Batman. Many might find it odd that Bill Finger never tried to receive recognition as Batman's co-creator, let alone any sort of monetary compensation. In Marc Tyler Nobleman's blog, Nobelmania, Jerry Robinson described Bill Finger as, \"Very soft. Naive, a as most of us were.\" In the book The Creators of Batman: Bob, Bill & The Dark Knight by Rik Worth, Bill Finger was described as \"Easy-going to the point of retiring. He was just grateful to be in the room.\" In the book The Many Lives of Catwoman: The Felonious History of a Feline Fatale, author Tim Hanley writes, \"The most common term Finger's associates used to describe him was 'agreeable,' though his son put it far more bluntly when he said, 'My father had a very weak spine.' It seems possible that while Bill Finger was immensely talented and had a right to be credited as the co-creator of Batman, he simply was not capable of standing up to Bob Kane.It seems likely that had it not been for Bill Finger, Batman may have simply been another obscure comic book character, like The Crimson Avenger or Air Wave, published during the Golden Age of Comic Books. It was Bill Finger who provided Batman with most of the things that come to mind when we think of Batman. everything from his secret identity to Gotham City. And it seems likely that without the supporting characters and mythos that Bill Finger provided Batman, the character might never have taken off. While it is good that Bill Finger is finally being recognized as the co-creator of Batman, he really should have long ago."},
{"title": "TCM 31 Days of Oscar 2024", "date": "Tuesday, February 6, 2024", "text": "As my regular readers know, I have always had mixed feelings about Turner Classic Movie's 31 Days of Oscar, the month-long programming block during which TCM shows movies that were either nominated for an Academy Award or won an Academy Award. On the one hand, throughout the month Turner Classic Movies shows a lot of great movies. On the other hand, TCM's usual programming is pre-empted for the whole month (in other words, no Noir Alley). And while TCM shows a lot of great movies, it is often the case that my favourites are scheduled at awkward times. For example, this year Network (1976) doesn't air until 1:00 in the morning. The Naked City (1948) doesn't air until 1:45 AM. The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), which one would think TCM would want to air in prime time, doesn't air until 11:00 PM. Sadly, I watch Turner Classic Movies less during 31 Days of Oscar than any other time of year, although I do use the Watch TCM app more than I usually do. Regardless, this year 31 Days of Oscar runs from Friday, February 9 through the early morning of Monday, March 11. Here are my picks as to what to watch this year. All times are Central.

She was best known for such songs as \"Brand New Key,\" \"What Have They Done to My Song Ma,\" and her cover of The Rolling Stones' \"Ruby Tuesday. Melanie was born on February 3 1947 in Queens in New York City. She was only four years old when she sang on the radio show Live Like a Millionaire. Her family moved to Long Branch, New Jersey, she attended Long Branch High School. After running away to California, she returned to New Jersey where she attended Red Bank High School in Red Bank, New Jersey. Before she even graduated high school she performed at The Inkwell, a coffee house in Long Branch. After graduating from high school she studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. She started performing at folk music clubs in Greenwich Village in New York City. She signed with Columbia Records and released two singles on the label, \"Beautiful People\" in 1967 and \"Garden City\" in 1968. Neither charted. She then signed with Buddah Records. Her first several singles on the label would not chart in the United States, although \"Bo Bo's Party\" went to no. 33 on the Belgian singles chart. Her first album, Born to Be, was released in November 1968. In 1969 she performed at the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair. The experience inspired her song \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain),\" which turned out to be her first hit. It reached no. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. She followed \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)\" with \"Peace Will Come (According to Plan),\" which reached no. 32 on the Billboard Hot 100. Her biggest hit, \"Brand New Key,\" was released in October 1971. It hit no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian singles chart. It went to no. 4 in the United Kingdom. It was also in 1971 that she left Buddah Records, and formed her own label, Neighbourhood Records. Melanie would only have two more singles reach the Billboard Hot 100, \"Ring the Living Bell,\" which reached no. 31 on the Hot 100 in 1972, and \"Bitter Bad,\" which peaked at no. 36 on the Hot 100 in 1973. While Melanie no longer hit the charts, she maintained a loyal following and continued to record and perform for the rest of her life. In all she released over thirty studio albums. Prior to her death she had been in the studio recording cover songs for what would be her 32nd album. Melanie was certainly a pioneer for independent recording artists, having founded her own label in 1971. And while she was not often recognized for her contributions to music in the early Seventies, she would have an impact on future recording artists. Her voice was surely unique, blending the delicacy of Joan Baez with the sheer power of Janis Joplin. Melanie also defied genre. Her biggest hit, \"Brand New Key,\" evoked Tin Pan Alley in the Thirties. \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)\" was more straight-forward folk rock. Her music explored the human condition, from lost love to being weary of the world. And her songs, even when they were on serious subjects, often had a sense of humour. Melanie was certainly in a class all her own."},

{"title": "The 110th Birthday of Batman Co-Creator Bill Finger", "date": "Thursday, February 8, 2024", "text": "Chances are good that unless you are a comic book fan, you have never heard of Bill Finger. Despite this, it seems very likely that you have heard of his most famous creation, Batman. While for much of his life artist Bob Kane took sole credit for the creation of Batman and his mythos, in truth it was Bill Finger who did most of the work in the creation of the Dark Knight. Indeed, Bill Finger even came up with what is now Batman's most famous nickname, \"the Dark Knight.\"Milton \"Bill\" Finger was born on February 8 1914 in Denver, Colorado. His family moved to The Bronx, New York City. Bill Finger attended DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx and graduated from there in 1933. Following his graduation. he worked as a part-time shoe salesman and aspired to be a writer. He met artist Bob Kane at a party in 1938 and Kane offered him a job ghost writing the comic book features Rusty and His Pals and Clip Carson.Following the huge success that National Comics experienced with Superman, the company wanted similar characters. Bob Kane then came up with the idea for a character called \"The Bat-Man.\" Bob Kane then had Bill Finger meet him at his apartment where he showed Mr. Finger a drawing of a character in reddish tights, boots, and a small domino mask. The character wore no gloves. Affixed to the character's back were two stiff, bat wings. Beneath the drawing in large letters was \"Batman.\" Bill Finger made several suggestions to Bob Kane, including a cowl with pointed bat ears, a scalloped cape, and gloves, as well as a darker colour scheme for the costume. Bill Finger's contributions to the character of Batman would not end there. It was Bill Finger who developed the secret identity of Batman, that of playboy Bruce Wayne. He took the first name from Robert the Bruce, King of the Scots from 1306 to 1329, and the last name from Revolutionary War hero and Founding Father Mad Anthony Wayne. Despite the considerable contributions Bill Finger made to the creation of Batman, when Bob Kane took The Bat-Man to editor Vin Sullivan, he made no mention of Bill Finger or the part he played the character's creation. Bob Kane's contract with Detective Comics Inc. gave Kane sole credit for the creation of Batman, and his signature would appear on every Batman story even when he did not do the art (and, more often than not, the art would be done by such ghost artists as Jerry Robinson, Dick Sprang, and Shelly Moldoff). When Bob Kane renegotiated his contract in 1946, he did not bother to mention Bill Finger either. What is more, Kane's second contract was even more lucrative than his first. It returned partial ownership of Batman to Bob Kane and included rights of reversion and the ability to veto the sale of Batman to any other company. The contract also guaranteed him a specific number of pages per month at what was then an incredible page rate, as well as a percentage of subsidiary rights.  As to Bill Finger who had done the heavy lifting in creating Batman, all he ever received was his usual page rate.The fact is that while Bob Kane received the credit and the money for creating Batman, it was Bill Finger who shaped the character as we know him. It seems likely it was Bill Finger who came up with Batman's origin, in which Bruce Wayne's parents are murdered.  He created the character of Commissioner Gordon, who appeared in the very first panel of the very first Batman story. He gave Gotham City its name. He created or co-created the characters of Robin, The Joker, Catwoman, The Riddler, and many of Batman's other villains. It was Bill Finger who gave Gotham City its name.While Bill Finger co-created Batman and created much of the character's mythos, he also created other comic book characters. He scripted the early stories of the Golden Age Green Lantern, Alan Scott, and is sometimes credited as co-creator with Martin Nodell. He created the character of Wildcat, with the character's costume designed by artist Irwin Hasen. With artist John Sikela he created Lana Lang, the love interest of Superboy. All three of these characters would have a lasting impact and still appear in the pages of DC Comics titles.It would take years for Bill Finger to receive recognition as the co-creator of Batman, and Bob Kane continued to insist that he was the sole creator the character even after considerable evidence had emerged about Bill Finger's contributions. It was in 1965 comic book fan and scholar Jerry Bails wrote an article, published in CAPA-Alpha no. 12 (September 1965), that recognized Bill Finger as the co-creator of Batman. As might be expected, Bob Kane strenuously denied the facts in the article. In the following years Bill Finger was increasingly recognized as the co-creator of Batman in comic book fandom. Even late in his life Bob Kane would acknowledge the considerable contributions that Bill Finger made to the Caped Crusader. In his biography Batman and Me, Bob Kane wrote, \"Now that my long-time friend and collaborator is gone, I must admit that Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved. He was an unsung hero ... I often tell my wife, if I could go back fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say. 'I'll put your name on it now. You deserve it.'\"Even after it was generally accepted that Bill Finger co-created Batman, it would be years before he would be credited as such by DC Comics. It was in 2006 that author Marc Tyler Nobleman began researching Bill Finger's role in the creation of Batman for a non-fiction picture book. Marc Tyler Nobleman uncovered the fact that Bill Finger's son Fred had a daughter, Athena Finger. He contacted Athena Finger and encouraged her to get in touch with DC Comics in order to get credit for Bill Finger as Batman's co-creator. His biography of Bill Finger, Bill the Boy Wonder: The Secret Co-Creator of Batman was published in 2012. It was in 2017, following negotiations with Bill Finger's granddaughter Athena Finger, that DC Entertainment began crediting Bill Finger. In movies Bill Finger was first credited as the co-creator of Batman in the movie Batman v. Superman: The Dawn of Justice (2016). In television he was first credited as the co-creator of Batman on the second season of Gotham. In 2017 a documentary about Marc Tyler Nobleman's research and his efforts to get recognition for Bill Finger, Batman & Bill, premiered on Hulu. Sadly, Bill Finger died on January 18 1974 when he was only 59, so he never lived to see the recognition he would receive as the co-creator of Batman. Many might find it odd that Bill Finger never tried to receive recognition as Batman's co-creator, let alone any sort of monetary compensation. In Marc Tyler Nobleman's blog, Nobelmania, Jerry Robinson described Bill Finger as, \"Very soft. Naive, a as most of us were.\" In the book The Creators of Batman: Bob, Bill & The Dark Knight by Rik Worth, Bill Finger was described as \"Easy-going to the point of retiring. He was just grateful to be in the room.\" In the book The Many Lives of Catwoman: The Felonious History of a Feline Fatale, author Tim Hanley writes, \"The most common term Finger's associates used to describe him was 'agreeable,' though his son put it far more bluntly when he said, 'My father had a very weak spine.' It seems possible that while Bill Finger was immensely talented and had a right to be credited as the co-creator of Batman, he simply was not capable of standing up to Bob Kane.It seems likely that had it not been for Bill Finger, Batman may have simply been another obscure comic book character, like The Crimson Avenger or Air Wave, published during the Golden Age of Comic Books. It was Bill Finger who provided Batman with most of the things that come to mind when we think of Batman. everything from his secret identity to Gotham City. And it seems likely that without the supporting characters and mythos that Bill Finger provided Batman, the character might never have taken off. While it is good that Bill Finger is finally being recognized as the co-creator of Batman, he really should have long ago."},
{"title": "TCM 31 Days of Oscar 2024", "date": "Tuesday, February 6, 2024", "text": "As my regular readers know, I have always had mixed feelings about Turner Classic Movie's 31 Days of Oscar, the month-long programming block during which TCM shows movies that were either nominated for an Academy Award or won an Academy Award. On the one hand, throughout the month Turner Classic Movies shows a lot of great movies. On the other hand, TCM's usual programming is pre-empted for the whole month (in other words, no Noir Alley). And while TCM shows a lot of great movies, it is often the case that my favourites are scheduled at awkward times. For example, this year Network (1976) doesn't air until 1:00 in the morning. The Naked City (1948) doesn't air until 1:45 AM. The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), which one would think TCM would want to air in prime time, doesn't air until 11:00 PM. Sadly, I watch Turner Classic Movies less during 31 Days of Oscar than any other time of year, although I do use the Watch TCM app more than I usually do. Regardless, this year 31 Days of Oscar runs from Friday, February 9 through the early morning of Monday, March 11. Here are my picks as to what to watch this year. All times are Central.

That having been said, he played many other roles throughout this career. He was excellent as Chief Hampton Forbes on In the Heat of the Night. He also gave a good performance as Dillon in Predator. Among his best performances were the episodes of Tour of Duty in which he played Colonel Brewster, an officer devoted to doing what is right. Although best known for his work in action movies, Carl Weathers was also capable of playing in comedies. In Happy Gilmore he played Chubbs, the one-handed former pro golfer who becomes Happy's coach. Carl Weathers was a talented actor and certainly a versatile one."},

She was best known for such songs as \"Brand New Key,\" \"What Have They Done to My Song Ma,\" and her cover of The Rolling Stones' \"Ruby Tuesday. Melanie was born on February 3 1947 in Queens in New York City. She was only four years old when she sang on the radio show Live Like a Millionaire. Her family moved to Long Branch, New Jersey, she attended Long Branch High School. After running away to California, she returned to New Jersey where she attended Red Bank High School in Red Bank, New Jersey. Before she even graduated high school she performed at The Inkwell, a coffee house in Long Branch. After graduating from high school she studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. She started performing at folk music clubs in Greenwich Village in New York City. She signed with Columbia Records and released two singles on the label, \"Beautiful People\" in 1967 and \"Garden City\" in 1968. Neither charted. She then signed with Buddah Records. Her first several singles on the label would not chart in the United States, although \"Bo Bo's Party\" went to no. 33 on the Belgian singles chart. Her first album, Born to Be, was released in November 1968. In 1969 she performed at the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair. The experience inspired her song \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain),\" which turned out to be her first hit. It reached no. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. She followed \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)\" with \"Peace Will Come (According to Plan),\" which reached no. 32 on the Billboard Hot 100. Her biggest hit, \"Brand New Key,\" was released in October 1971. It hit no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian singles chart. It went to no. 4 in the United Kingdom. It was also in 1971 that she left Buddah Records, and formed her own label, Neighbourhood Records. Melanie would only have two more singles reach the Billboard Hot 100, \"Ring the Living Bell,\" which reached no. 31 on the Hot 100 in 1972, and \"Bitter Bad,\" which peaked at no. 36 on the Hot 100 in 1973. While Melanie no longer hit the charts, she maintained a loyal following and continued to record and perform for the rest of her life. In all she released over thirty studio albums. Prior to her death she had been in the studio recording cover songs for what would be her 32nd album. Melanie was certainly a pioneer for independent recording artists, having founded her own label in 1971. And while she was not often recognized for her contributions to music in the early Seventies, she would have an impact on future recording artists. Her voice was surely unique, blending the delicacy of Joan Baez with the sheer power of Janis Joplin. Melanie also defied genre. Her biggest hit, \"Brand New Key,\" evoked Tin Pan Alley in the Thirties. \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)\" was more straight-forward folk rock. Her music explored the human condition, from lost love to being weary of the world. And her songs, even when they were on serious subjects, often had a sense of humour. Melanie was certainly in a class all her own."},

{"title": "How Did The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour Survive the Rural Purge?", "date": "Monday, January 29, 2024", "text": "The 1970-1971 American television season will always be remembered as the season of the Rural Purge. The Rural Purge was a mass cancellation of shows whose audiences were considered too rural, too old, or both. All three networks cancelled shows that appealed to rural or older audiences, but by far CBS cancelled the most. In fact, two of the shows they cancelled (Mayberry R.F.D. and Hee Haw) still number among the highest rated shows ever cancelled. Among the shows that would have seemed to have appealed to rural audiences that somehow survived was The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour. In fact, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour was lower rated than some of the rural shows that CBS did cancel. It only came in at no. 35 in  the Nielsen ratings for the year. The question is then, \"How did The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour survive the Rural Purge when higher rated shows did not?\"The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour was essentially a spin-off of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The Summer Brothers Smothers Show was a summer replacement series for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour that aired during the summer of 1968. It was hosted by rising pop country star Glen Campbell, whose hits \"Witchita Lineman\" and \"Galveston\" had a great deal of crossover appeal. Both songs had hit the Billboard Hot 100 (\"Witchita Lineman\" making it all the way to no. 3 on the chart). The Summer Brothers Smothers Show proved successful enough that Glen Campbell was given his own variety show, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, which debuted on January 29 1969. The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour proved successful in its first two seasons. It ranked no. 15 in its first season and no. 20 in its second season. For its third season, the 1970-1971 season, its ratings dropped. As mentioned above, it only came in at no. 35 for the season. Of course, it was during the 1970-1971 season that the Rural Purge took place. The Rural Purge largely emerged from two events. The first was the institution of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation known as the Prime Time Access Rule, which would take effect starting with the 1971-1972 season. The rule came about because the FCC thought that the American broadcast networks controlled too much programming on television and was meant to increase competition on local TV stations. Among other things, the Prime Time Access Rule decreased how much the networks could program each night. As a result, the networks had to cancel many more shows than they ever had before.The second event was a change in programming strategy on the part of CBS. Since the 1950s ABC had sought viewers in the key demographic of 18-49 years old. Starting in the early Sixties, NBC also started seeking viewers in the key demographic of 18-49 years old. Throughout the Sixties, CBS had continued to focus on the over-all number of viewers of any given show. It was in 1969 that Robert Wood became the new president of CBS. It was Robert Wood and his Vice President in Charge of Programming, Fred Silverman, who shifted CBS's programming strategy from capturing the largest total audience to capturing viewers who were between 18 and 49 and living in urban areas. For the 1970-1971 season CBS then decided to cancel shows not based on how many viewers were watching those shows, but who was watching those shows. As a result, shows that appealed to rural viewers, older viewers, or both were cancelled. Long-running and sometimes even high-rated shows were cancelled, including The Beverly Hillbillies, The Ed Sullivan Show, Green Acres, Hee Haw, Lassie, and Mayberry R.F.D. Curiously, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour was not among the shows that was cancelled. On the surface, at least, it would seem that The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour would largely appeal to a rural audience. After all, its host was a country music star and the show had featured its share of country singers as guests, including Johnny Cash, Roy Clark, Waylon Jennings, Buck Owens, and Mel Tillis. Unfortunately, I was unable to find the Nielsen ratings for The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour for the 1970-1971 season, let alone a breakdown of its demographics during the season. That having been said, it seems possible that The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour appealed to a younger and less rural audience than Hee Haw or Mayberry R.F.D.That this could have been possible is borne out by an article on The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour in the October 10 1970 issue of Billboard. The article states, \"The Campbell audience is broad. They range from young adults to middle-aged and older.\" If The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour did appeal to younger viewers, much of it might have been due to the musical guests on the show. While Hee Haw exclusively featured country music singers as guests, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour featured rock and pop artists who would appeal to younger viewers. During its first season alone Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, The Vogues, Nancy Sinatra, The Righteous Brothers, and The Association appeared on the show. In addition to these musical guests, The Glen Campbell Hour also featured the promotional films for The Beatles' songs \"Get Back\" and \"Don't Let Me Down.\" Among the guests on the third season of The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour (the 1970-1971 season) were The 5th Dimension, The Osmonds, The Supremes, Jackie DeShannon, Sunday's Child, Sonny & Cher, and The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. It is possible that in featuring rock and pop artists, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour may have appealed to a younger, more urban audience than other shows with rural appeal.Of course, some might point out that The Johnny Cash Show, which also featured rock and pop artists, was cancelled during the 1970-1971 season by ABC. Indeed, if anything, The Johnny Cash Show featured bigger rock and pop artists than The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour. Among the guests on The Johnny Cash Show throughout its run were The Cowsills, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Bob Dylan, Gordon Lightfoot, The Guess Who, Lulu, Joni Mitchell, Linda Rondstandt, Dusty Springfield, and others. It can also be pointed out that The Ed Sullivan Show also featured rock and pop acts clear into its final season, and yet it was among the first victims of the Rural Purge. While the rock and pop acts on The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour probably helped the show get a younger audience than other shows with rural appeal (or other variety shows, for that matter), it may not have been the only reason its audience may have been slightly younger.Indeed, much of the reason for the survival of The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour may have been its star. Glen Campbell was a country music star, but he was one with a good deal of crossover appeal. In 1967 his single \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" peaked at no. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100. As mentioned earlier, \"Wichita Lineman\" hit no. 3 on the chart. \"Galveston\" went to no. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. What is more, Glen Campbell had several other singles that would reach the top forty of the Billboard Hot 100 in the years 1967 to 1970.  Much of the reason Glen Campbell's appeal went beyond country music listeners is that he was not a traditional country music singer. His music has often been described as \"pop country,\" and even counted as \"easy listening.\"Beyond Glen Campbell and the music guests on his show, another reason The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour may have appealed to a young audience is the show's comedy sketches. Among the writers on the show were ones who had written for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, including Cecil Tuck, Steve Martin, and Rob Reiner. While the humour on The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour tended to be apolitical, unlike The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, it may well have appealed to a younger crowd than the comedy routines on other variety shows, much less the countryfied humour on Hee Haw or Mayberry R.F.D.Regardless, while The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour survived the Rural Purge, it lasted only one more season. For its fourth season CBS moved The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour from Sunday night to Tuesday night. While the show came in at no. 37 for the season, it was ultimately cancelled. Although sometimes counted as a victim of the Rural Purge, it was cancelled well after the Rural Purge had unfolded during the 1970-1971 season. While it is possible that the The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour had lost whatever young people in its audience it had, it also seems possible that the cancellation was due to the fact that Glen Campbell was no longer the hot commodity in 1972 that he had been in 1969. While the show was on the air, his last single to hit the Billboard Hot 100 was a cover of Dionne Warwick's \"I Say a Little Prayer\" in 1971, which only went to no. 81 on the chart. This, coupled with a new time slot, may have resulted in its slight drop in the ratings for its fourth season. The lone survivor of the Rural Purge at CBS, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, aired its last episode on June 13 1972."},

His theme for Top Secret even reached the British record charts. The theme to The Avengers remains one of the greatest themes to a television show ever composed. And Laurie Johnson was nothing if not prolific. For The Avengers alone he composed around 50 hours of music. To this day his music can be heard on everything from Mr. Robot to Antique Road Trip. Few composers ever saw the success Laurie Johnson did."},

The cause was complications from dementia.Charles Osgood was born Charles Osgood Wood III in the Bronx in New York City. He attended Fordham University. While there he volunteered at the college FM radio station, WFUV. Among his fellow students were Alan Alda and Jack Haley, Jr. After graduating from Fordham, he worked as an announcer at WGMS (AM) and WGMS-FM in Washington, DC. It was in 1954 that he met the announcer for the United States Army Band, who told him that he was getting out soon. Knowing that he would soon be drafted, Mr. Osgood then enlisted in the United States Army and then spent the next few years as the announcer for the United States Army Band. He was based out of Fort Myer in Virginia and would fill in as an announcer at WGMS when he went to Washington. When President Dwight D. Eisenhower had a heart attack, it was Charles Osgood who hosted a closed-circuit radio broadcast to President Eisenhower's hospital room. It was while he was in the United States Army that he and his roommate, John Cacavas (who would later compose scores for television shows and movies), collaborated on various songs. Their composition \"The Gallant Men\" featured Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois reading a patriotic poem by H. Paul Jeffers. It reached no. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. It would later be used in the movie Easy Rider (1969).After his service Charles Osgood returned to WGMS, as a full-time announcer, using his given name Charles Wood. The following year he became the station's program director. He provided introduction and commentary for a six-record album of a collection of thirty-three speeches by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt titled FDR Speaks. It was in April 1962 that RKO General, owner of WGMS, transferred Mr. Osgood to WHCT in Hartford, Connecticut where he would be the station's general manager. WHCT was an early subscription television service, so that subscribers needed a decoder to watch the station. As it turned out, WHCT was not a success and Charles Osgood was not a success.Out of work, Charles Osgood contacted a former classmate from Fordham, Frank Maguire, who was in charge of program development for ABC in New York. He hired Charles Osgood as a co-host and writer for the ABC Radio program Flair Reports. To avoid confusion with radio announcer Charles Woods, Charles Osgood then began using his first and middle name, \"Charles Osgood,\" professionally.It was in 1967 that Charles Osgood moved to CBS Radio. He worked as a reporter and anchor at WCBS (AM). It as also in 1967 that The Osgood File began as a segment on WCBS. It went national in 1971. It was in 1971 that Charles Osgood made the move to television and joined CBS News. He served as the anchor on The CBS Sunday Night News from 1981 to 198. He served as co-anchor on The CBS Morning News and an occasional news reader on CBS This Morning. He served as the host of CBS News Sunday Morning from 1994 to 2016, the longest serving host in the show's history. It was in 2017 that he retired from The Osgood File due to health concerns.  Over the years he contributed several stories to CBS News.Charles Osgood served as the narrator on the animated movie Horton Hears a Who (2008). He wrote a syndicated news paper column for Tribune Media Services, as well as several books. He wrote a three-act play, A Single Voice, in 1956.  As a radio and television commentator, Charles Osgood was ideal. He was affable and eloquent, and even utilized verse from time to time. Whether on CBS News Sunday Morning or The Osgood File, he was able to deliver stories that would both entertain and educate viewers and listeners. What is more, he was a light in the often dark world of television and radio news. The stories he covered were upbeat and positive, covering everything from popular culture to the arts to everyday people. He was in many ways a bright light in the darkness of television and radio news, where bad news often outnumbers the good news. To borrow some words from his family's statement upon his death, Charles Osgood highlighted the better parts of humanity. He was a rarity during his career and, sadly, even more of a rarity now."},
{"title": "Dial L for Latch-Key by Scott Fivelson", "date": "Wednesday, January 24, 2024", "text": ">Forty-three years after his death, Alfred Hitchcock remains one of the best known directors of all time. Even those few who have never seen his films can recognize him when they see him. Over the years Hitchcock's films and the tropes common to those films have been parodied many times, but few of those parodies are as funny as the one-act play Dial L for Latch-Key by screenwriter/director Scott Fivelson.Dial L for Latch-Key takes its title from Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Dial M for Murder, which in turn was based on the 1952 play by Frederick Knott. It draws heavily upon Dial M for Murder for inspiration, with characters based upon the stars of that film (Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, and Robert Cummings). At the same time, Dial L for Latch-Key goes well beyond being a mere parody of Dial M for Murder, with its own twists and turns. Even those who have seen Dial M for Murder repeatedly will not be able to predict how Dial L for Latch-Key ends.What makes Dial L for Latch-Key all the more fun are the many references to Alfred Hitchcock's films throughout the play. The play references Hitchcock's more famous works, such as The Birds (1963), as well as works that are not quite as famous, such as Stage Fright (1950). Dial L for Latch-Key also plays with the various tropes to be found in many of Hitchcock's films, not just Dial M for Murder. What makes Dial L for Latch-Key even better is that from time to time it very subtly breaks the fourth wall. In particular, the character of the Inspector seems to be in on the joke with the audience.Dial L for Latch-Key has been produced onstage in London at the Upstairs at the Gatehouse theatre starring jazz singer/actor James Torme, at the Accidental Theatre in Belfast, and on stages in San Francisco, Toronto, and elsewhere. Dial L for Latch-Key has been adapted as a radio play and released as an audiobook (Blackstone Audio), has been broadcast on Resonance FM in London, and has been published as an eBook (Blackstone Publishing).Dial L for Latch-Key is a delightful, yet respectful send-up of Alfred Hitchcock and his movies. What is more, it is done in such a way that one need not be a Hitchcock fan to appreciate it."},

In the Naughts he directed the TV movie Dinner with Friends and the feature film The Statement (2003).Norman Jewison directed some of my favourite films, including Send Me No Flowers,The Russians Are Coming The Russians are Coming, In the Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof, Jesus Christ Superstar, Rollerball, and Moonstruck. He was certainly versatile. He directed everything from light comedies to crime dramas to musicals to science fiction. Whether he was dealing with comedy or drama, he had a gift for dealing with serious issues. Over the years he dealt with xenophobia and nationalism, racism, religion, corporatism, and religion. What is more, he handled such weighty topics very well. As a director Norman Jewison had a gift for bringing out the best in his actors. While Norman Jewison was nominated for the Oscar for Best Director only a few times, actors in his movies were nominated for Oscars twelve different times. Norman Jewison may well have been the most honoured Canadian director in film history, but he was also among the best directors of all time from any country. He certainly ranks among my favourite directors."},
{"title": "The Late Great Mary Weiss", "date": "Saturday, January 20, 2024", "text": "While their success would be short-lived, The Shangri-Las proved to be one of the most influential singing groups of all time. Much of their success was due to the powerful vocals of Mary Weiss, who was only fifteen when their first hit, \"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\", was released. Mary Weiss would spend most of her life outside the music business and outside the public eye, but the years she spent as part of The Shangri-Las had an impact on popular music in a way that few others ever would. Sadly, Mary Weiss died yesterday, January 19 2024, at the age of 75.Mary Weiss was born on December 28 1948 in New York City. She developed an interest in music when she was only five years old, and loved The Ink Spots. She began singing when she was very young as well, singing in her church's choir and in school plays.  Her brother George was eight years older than her, and a huge Elvis Presley fan. She listened to many of his records. Mary Weiss was a fan of The Everly Brothers and Neil Sedaka.Mary Wiess attended Andrew Jackson High School in Queens. It as there that she, her older sister Betty Weiss, and twins Margie and Mary Ann Ganser formed their own vocal group. The group performed at talent shows and sock hops. Record producer Artie Ripp heard The group and worked out a record deal with Kama Sutra Records. It was at this point that they began calling themselves The Shangri-Las. Their first single, \"Simon Says,\" was released on the Smash label, and featured Betty Weiss singing lead vocals. It failed to chart. Their second single, \"Wishing Well,\" was released on Spokane Records. It also failed to chart. Fortunately, The Shangri-Las were discovered by record producer and songwriter George \"Shadow\" Morton. In April 1964 their parents, the girls being minors, signed the group to Red Bird Records. The Shangri-Las then had their first hit, a song by Shadow Morton titled \"Remember (Walking in the Sand).\" The song peaked at no. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their next single, \"Leader of the Pack\" (written by George \"Shadow\" Morton, Jeff Barry, and Ellie Greenwich), went to no. 1 on the chart. With their success The Shangri-Las performed with such artists as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Drifters, James Brown, Wayne Fontana and The Mindbenders, Herman's Hermits, Del Shannon, and yet others.Following \"The Leader of the Pack,\" The Shangri-Las would have hits, both major and minor, with \"Give Him a Great Big Kiss,\" \"Give Us Your Blessings,\" \"I Can Never Go Home Anymore,\" and \"Long Live Our Love.\" Red Bird Records folded in 1966 and The Shangri-Las then signed with Mercury Records. Unfortunately, Mercury Records showed little interest in The Shangri-Las and Shadow Morton had started working with such artists as  Vanilla Fudge. The Shangri-Las then disbanded in 1968. Afterwards Mary Weiss attended college while working as a secretary. She later worked in the architectural industry and eventually became the the chief purchasing agent for a large architectural firm. She later worked as a commercial interior designer and furniture installer in New York City. For most of her later years Mary Weiss stayed away from performing music professionally. She sang back-up on Aerosmith's 1979 cover of \"Remember (Walking in the Sand).\" In 1989 The Shangri-Las reunited for a single show. In 2005 Mary Weiss recorded her only solo album, Dangerous Game, and toured to support it.Mary Weiss had an utterly unique voice, one that was both powerful and emotive. It was perfectly suited to Shadow Morton's often overwrought lyrics, which covered everything from being jilted to teenage death to being in love with someone from the wrong side of the tracks. Mary Weiss's voice was different from that of any other lead singer of any other girl group, and it set The Shangri-Las apart from the rest.Of course, The Shangri-Las' image differed from that of other girl groups. While other girl groups tended be demure, The Shangri-Las had a \"tough girl\" image. Other girl groups performed in gowns and pumps. The Shangri-Las wore less formal attire, even wearing leather, blue jeans, and boots. As it was, the lyrics to their songs set them apart from other groups. The Shangri-Las' songs dealt not with lost love or happy romances, but loneliness, abandonment, classism, and all around teenage angst. There was simply no other girl group like The Shangri-Las.Ultimately, The Shangri-Las would have an impact that was farther reaching than many other groups. Their songs have been covered by artists from Aerosmith to Blondie to The New York Dolls to Twisted Sister. They would have an influence on the punk and New Wave movements, including such acts as Blondie, The Damned, The Dead Boys, Patti Smith, and The Ramones. The Shangri-Las may have been together for a short time, but they had a lasting impact. There can be no doubt Mary Weiss's voice was responsible for The Shangri-Las' success and continued influence."},
{"title": "Four Lesser Known Cary Grant Movies", "date": "Thursday, January 18, 2024", "text": "Today is the 120th anniversary of Cary Grant's birth. In his honour, then, I thought I would list my four favourite, lesser known Cary Grant movies. By \"lesser known\" I mean that the average person is not likely to have heard of them. I trust that most film buffs have not only heard of these four movies, but have seen them as well.The Awful Truth (1937): Whenever I think of Cary Grant's leading ladies, it is Irene Dunne who is the first to come to mind. Much of this is due to The Awful Truth, which is one of my all-time favourite Cary Grant movies. In The Awful Truth, Jerry Warriner (Cary Grant) and Lucy Warriner (Irene Dunne) decide to divorce after suspecting each other of infidelity. As it turns out, they find it difficult to let each other go. The Awful Truth blends physical comedy, one-liners, and great characterization in what is possibly the perfect screwball comedy. Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are perfectly matched and have excellent chemistry together. As to Miss Dunne, she plays a character that is both intelligent and fun-loving. As to Mr. Grant, an argument can be made that The Awful Truth is the first film featuring Cary Grant as most of us have come to think of him, sophisticated yet mischievous. Holiday (1938): Holiday is not as well as Bringing Up Baby (1938) or The Philadelphia Story (1940), two other films starring Cary Grant and Katarine Hepburn, but it really should be. In Holiday Cary Grant plays Johnny Case, a self-made man about to marry a wealthy socialite, only to find his plans complicated after he meets her sister, Linda Seton (Katharine Hepburn). Holiday is particularly effective as a criticism of amassing large amounts of money simply for the sake of amassing large amounts of money, as well as an effective comedy and romance. Both Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn are in top form in the movie.Mr. Lucky (1943): Mr. Lucky finds Cary Grant playing a gambler and conman who operates a gambling ship who has an attack of conscience when he falls for a charity worker (Laraine Day). Cary Grant gives an excellent performance as Joe \"the Greek\" Adams, who starts having second thoughts about his chosen profession. Laraine Day is also excellent as Dorothy Bryant, the charity worker and socialite who falls for Joe despite her better judgement. It would be a mistake to think of Mr. Lucky as simply another romantic comedy, as there is so much more going on in the film.My Favorite Wife (1940): My Favorite Wife once more pairs Irene Dunne with Cary Grant. This time Irene Dunne plays a woman, Ellen Arden, who is shipwrecked on an island for many years. In that time she is declared legally dead so that her husband, Nick Arden (Cary Grant) can marry another woman, Bianca Bates (Gail Patrick). As it turns out, Ellen is rescued from the island, which complicates things considerably. Cary Grant and Irene Dunne have their usual chemistry and are in top form. Gail Patrick, who so often played the other woman, also does a great job playing Louisa. Along with The Awful Truth, it is one of Cary Grant's best comedies."},
{"title": "The Late Great Joyce Randolph", "date": "Wednesday, January 17, 2024", "text": "Joyce Randolph, who played Trixie Norton on the classic sitcom The Honeymooners, died on January 13 2024 at the age of 99. She was the last surviving cast member of The Honeymooners.Joyce Randolph was born Joyce Sirola on October 21 1924 in Detroit. She attended Cooley High School in Detroit and after graduation worked at Saks Fifth Avenue. At the same time she she appeared in Wayne University Workshop productions. It was not long before she received a role in a touring production of Stage Door. In 1943 she moved to New York City to pursue a career in acting. In 1944 she made her television debut in a one-act play aired on the television station WABD titled Gander Sauce. In 1950 she appeared in the TV shows The Colgate Comedy Hour, Inside Detective, Buck Rogers, Famous Jury Trials, The Clock, and I Cover Times Square. In 1950 she appeared on Broadway in Ladies Night in a Turkish Bath.It was in 1951 that Jack Gleason hired Joyce Randolph to play Trixie Norton in the \"Honeymooners\" sketches on Cavalcade of Stars. He had seen her in a commercial for Clorets chewing gum.  Trixie was the wife of sewer worker Ed Norton (Art Carney), who also happened to be the best friend of lead character Ralph Kramden (Jackie Gleason). Elaine Stritch had originated the role, but only played it for one episode. When Jackie Gleason moved to CBS she remained in the role of Trixie in \"Honeymooners\" sketches on The Jackie Gleason Show. In 1952 she also appeared as Trixie in a \"Honeymooners\" sketch on Toast of the Town (later renamed The Ed Sullivan Show. She continued to play Trixie on the classic sitcom The Honeymooners. After the sitcom ended, she continued to appear as Trixie on a revival of The Jackie Gleason Show.  In the Fifties Joyce Randolph also appeared on the TV shows Short Short Dramas, The Plainclothesman, The Jack Benny Program, The Mail Story, and Modern Romances.Joyce Randolph found herself typecast as Trixie Norton following her stints on The Jackie Gleason Show and The Honeymooners. Afterwards she did summer stock and appeared in commercials. In 1964 she guest starred on an episode of The Nurses. She reprised her role as Trixie on the sitcom Hi Honey, I'm Home!. She had a cameo in the movie Everything's Jake (2000). While others played Trixie Norton as well, Joyce Randolph remains the best remembered, and I think it is due to more than the fact that she played the role in the \"Classic 39.\" Quite simply, as Trixie Norton, Joyce Randolph was one of the funniest straight women of all time. When reacting to Ralph or Ed's antics, she could get laughs with as little as a look. Her delivery was always pitch perfect for comedy. Joyce Randolph also had great rapport with Audrey Meadows, who played Ralph's wife Alice, and the two of them made a great team. If The Honeymooners is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time and the surviving \"Honeymooners\" sketches still hold up today, much of the credit must go to Joyce Randolph."},
{"title": "The 50th Anniversary of Happy Days", "date": "Monday, January 15, 2024", "text": "Happy Days was among the most successful shows to air on ABC in the Seventies. It spent eight of its eleven seasons in the top twenty shows for the year, three of them in the top five for the year, and one season as the number one show on the air. In the end it would be ABC's second longest running sitcom after The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (here it must be pointed out that My Three Sons and Make Room for Daddy debuted on ABC, but moved to CBS). Happy Days was part of a nostalgia craze in the Seventies that embraced eras from the 1930s (The Waltons) to the 1940s (Ellery Queen) to the 1960s (American Graffiti). In the case of Happy Days, the show was originally set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1955. It centred on teenager Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard), whose father, Howard (Tom Bosley), owned a hardware store. His mother, Marion (Mation Ross), was a somewhat traditional housewife. His younger sister was Joanie (Erin Moran). Richie's best friends were Potsie Weber (Anson Williams) and Ralph Malph (Don Most). Arthur \"Fonzie\" Fonzarelli (Henry Winkler), AKA \"The Fonz,\" was a leather-clad, motorcycle riding greaser who would eventually become Richie's best friend. The origins of Happy Days go back to a cold winter's night in Newark, New Jersey when Michael Eisner, then vice president for daytime programming at ABC, and Tom Miller, then Vice President of Development at Paramount, were delayed at the airport. Not knowing when their flight would depart, to pass the time the two men decided to develop a television show. Both men liked shows centred around families. Tom Miller suggested that it take place in another era, so that it wouldn't look old once it went into reruns.\" Messrs. Eisner and Miller brought in Garry Marshall to develop a show along the lines of what they had discussed. At that time Garry Marshall was the executive producer on the sitcom The Odd Couple and one of the two men, with Jerry Belson, who had developed it for television. Garry Marshall created a prospective show titled New Family in Town that centred on a family in the 1950s. The pilot was shot in late 1971. Unfortunately, ABC passed on the pilot, but it aired as a segment of Paramount's anthology series Love, American Style on February 25 1972 under the title \"Love and the Television Set.\" In \"Love and the Television Set,\" the Cunnimghams become the first family in their neighbourhood to get a television set. Richie and Potsie become convinced that the new television set can then be used as a means to get girls. \"Love and the Television Set\" would be later be renamed \"Love and the Happy Days\" in syndication to capitalize on its link to the hit sitcom.The cast of \"Love and the Television Set\" differed from the cast of Happy Days to a degree.  Marion Ross Ron Howard, and Anson Williams were already in place as Marion, Richie, and Potsie, but Howard Cunningham was played by Harold Gould and Richie's younger sister Joanie was played by Susan Neher. Ric Carrott played Richie's older brother Chuck. On Happy Days Chuck Cunningham would be played by Gavin O'Herlihy in the first season and Ralph Roberts in two episodes of the second season. Grandma, played by Nellie Burt, was a character in \"Love and the Television Set who never appeared on Happy Days. As to the character of Fonzie, who would become all-important to Happy Days, he was not in the pilot. It would be \"Love and the Television Set\" in part that would lead George Lucas to cast Ron Howard as Steve Bolander in his movie American Graffiti (1973).  American Graffiti would prove to be a hit at the box office, becoming the third highest grossing movie in the United States and Canada for 1973. The movie followed two high school graduates on their last night of summer vacation in 1962. The success of American Graffiti would lead to the prospective sitcom being re-pitched to ABC. A new pilot, \"All the Way,\" was then shot.There would be changes in the cast from \"Love and the Television Set\" and \"All the Way.\" It was originally meant for Harold Gould to remain as Howard Cunningham, but he was committed to a play he was performing in Paris, France. Tom Bosley, who had made frequent guest appearances on television and was a regular on the short-lived Debbie Reynolds Show, was then cast in the role. Erin Moran was cast as Richie's younger sister Joanie, the role having been originated by Susan Neher in the first pilot. Added to the cast was Don Most as Ralph Malph Henry Winkler as Fonzie,. It was in November 1973 that ABC picked up Happy Days as a mid-season replacement. During the first two seasons Happy Days would gradually evolve in the show as many people know it. In the first two seasons, the show was shot with a single-camera setup, not unlike feature films. A laugh track would then be added later. Beginning with the third season, Happy Days was shot using a three-camera set-up before a live audience. Earlier Garry Marshall had made a similar change on his sitcom The Odd Couple, which was shot using a single-camera set-up in its first season and then changed to a multi-camera setup for its second season onwards. In the first season Fonzie was only a secondary character. In fact, Henry Winkler was not even featured in the opening credits. Fonzie turned out to be a popular character, so he was given a bigger role in the show's second season. With that season Henry Winkler was added to the opening credits, receiving fourth billing. With the third season Fonzie was given an even bigger role on the show, moving into an apartment above the Cunninghams' garage.While Fonzie would prove to be possibly the most popular character on Happy Days, executives at ABC did not like the idea of the character wearing a leather jacket for fears that it would make him look like a criminal. Early in the run of Happy Days Fonzie is then seen wearing a windbreaker. Garry Marshall finally struck a compromise with ABC whereby The Fonz could wear his leather jacket if he was near his motorcycle. It was then rare that Fonzie was seen without his motorcycle, even taking it with him inside Arnold's Drive-In. ABC eventually relented and let Fonzie wear his leather jacket all the time. Another change that would be made to Happy Days early in his run is that the character of Richie's older brother Chuck would be dropped entirely from the show. Chuck Cunningham was played by Gavan O'Herihy in 10 episodes of the show's first season. Randolph Roberts then took over the role of Chuck for two episodes of the second season. Afterwards, the character completely disappeared from Happy Days and was never referred to again. No explanation ever given for the character's departure, and it was treated as if he never existed. In fact, in the eleventh and final season, Howard Cunningham even states that he has only two children. There would be other changes to the cast of Happy Days, although unlike Chuck Cunningham they would be acknowledged on the show. On Happy Days the local hangout was Arnold's Drive-In, owned by Arnold Takahashi (Pat Morita). Arnold appeared for the show's first three seasons. Afterwards he left Happy Days to star in his own short-lived show Mr. T and Tina. It was explained that Arnold got married and moved away, whereupon the new owner of Arnold's was Al Delvecchio, played by Al Molinaro (who had earlier played Officer Murray on Garry Marshall's sitcom The Odd Couple). A bigger change in the cast would come with the end of the seventh season. Ron Howard left Happy Days so that he could focus on his career as a director. It was explained on the show that Richie had joined the Army. Don Most, who played Ralph Malph, also left the show before the start of the eighth season. It was also explained that Ralph had also joined the Army. Other characters would be added to Happy Days during the show's run. In the fifth season Fonzie's younger cousin Chachi (Scott Baio) was added as a recurring character. In the sixth season he became a regular character. He would also become Joanie's love interest. Roger Phillips (Ted McGinley) was added during the show's eighth season. He was Marion's nephew and the basketball coach at Jefferson High School in Milwaukee. Roger was a recurring character in the eighth and ninth seasons of Happy Days and became a regular in the show's 10th season.The popularity of Happy Days would lead to a good deal of Happy Days merchandise on store shelves. As might be expected, Aladdin produced a Happy Days lunchbox with a Thermos. Gold Key published six issues of a Happy Days comic book from 1979 to 1980. There were also several novels based on the show by William Johnston, published by Tempo Books. There were also action figures, toy motorcycles, Halloween costumes, trading cards, and even bed sheets.With its success Happy Days would have several spin-offs. The first was also its most successful, and for a time it actually outperformed Happy Days in the ratings. The characters of Laverne DeFazio (Penny Marshall) and  Shirley Feeney first appeared in the third season Happy Days episode \"A Date with Fonzie.\" It was while Garry Marshall was at a conference with ABC executives on Marco Island off the coast of Florida that Fred Silverman, the the head of ABC, asked him to create more shows. More to the point, Fred Silverman asked Garry Marshall if he had any spinoffs. Mr. Marshall told him that he was too busy working on Happy Days, but Fred Silverman persisted. In truth, Garry Marshall had been mulling over an idea for a show centred around Laverne DeFazio and Shirley Feeney. He then pitched the idea of a show centred around two blue collar women. Fred Silverman liked the idea and gave him the go-ahead for the new show. Laverne & Shirley proved to be a hit from the beginning. The show ranked no. 3 for the year in its first season and then rose to no. 3 for the year for its second season. For its third and fourth seasons Laverne & Shirley was the number one show on the air. It toppled to no. 42 for its fifth season, primarily because ABC moved it from Tuesday to Thursday nights. Regardless, it ran eight seasons and proved to be a huge success in syndication as a rerun.The second spinoff from Happy Days would be the show that launched Robin Williams on his path to stardom. \"My Favorite Orkan\" was a fifth season episode in which Richie dreams that he encounters an alien named Mork from the planet Ork (Robin Williams). Robin Williams's performance as Mork impressed ABC executives so much that he was signed to star in his own series. Unlike Laverne & Shirley, which was originally set in the late Fifties just as Happy Days was, Mork & Mindy was set in the present day. It proved to be a hit in its first season, coming in at no. 3 for the year. For its second season ABC moved Mork & Mindy from Thursday night to Sunday night. It dropped to no. 27 for the year and, even after being moved back to its original timeslot, never recovered.The third spinoff of Happy Days was actually a Saturday morning cartoon. From the late Seventies into the early Eighties there was a trend towards basing Saturday morning cartoons on current, popular television shows. The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang featured Fonzie, Richie, and Ralph travelling through time, joined by new characters created specifically for the cartoon. Henry Winkler, Ron Howard, and Don Most all voiced their characters from the original series. After The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang came to an end, the Fonz would be introduced as a character in the second season of Laverne & Shirley in the Army, which was retitled Laverne & Shirley with The Fonz. Laverne & Shirley in the Army was a Saturday morning cartoon spinoff of Laverne & Shirley.The final spinoff of Happy Days was Joanie Loves Chachi. On Happy Days romance had blossomed between the characters of Joanie and Chachi, and the two eventually became aspiring musicians. In Joanie Loves Chachi they moved to Chicago to pursue a career in music. Al Devecchio also moved from Happy Days to the new spinoff, having opened a restaurant in Chicago. Joanie Loves Chachi proved successful in its first season, coming in at no. 4 for the year. For its second season ABC moved Joanie Loves Chachi from Tuesday to Thursday nights, where its ratings plummeted. It only came in at no. 70 for the year. It was cancelled only 13 episodes into the season. Joanie and Chachi then returned to Happy Days.There are two other shows that are often counted as spinoffs of Happy Days, although they should perhaps better be treated as related shows. Blansky's Beauties starred Nancy Walker as Nancy Blansky, a former Las Vegas showgirl now in charge of several Las Vegas showgirls. The character had appeared only a week before the debut of Blansky's Beauties in an episode of Happy Days, where she was introduced as Howard Cunningham's cousin. In other words, Blansky's Beauties did not grow out of an episode of Happy Days, but was instead conceived as a show with a link to Happy Days. This would make it questionable that it can be considered a spinoff.The other show that is sometimes counted as a spinoff of Happy Days is the fantasy comedy Out of the Blue. Out of the Blue starred Jimmy Brogan as angel-in-training Random, who is assigned as the guardian angel of a Chicago family. Out of the Blue actually debuted a few days before Random appeared on Happy Days in the episode \"Chachi Sells His Soul.\" Like Blansky's Beauties, then, Out of the Blue did not grow out of an episode of Happy Days, although it is a show that is linked to it. Neither Blansky's Beauties nor Out of the Blue proved successful. Blansky's Beauties only lasted 13 episodes, while Out of the Blue ended after only eight episodes aired (although there were four unaired episodes).Ratings for Happy Days would decline over time. After three seasons in the top five, for its seventh season Happy Days dropped to no. 17. It remained in the top twenty for its next few seasons, dropping to no. 28 for its tenth season. As to why Happy Days dropped in the ratings in its tenth season, it seems likely that it was the debut of a new series on rival network NBC , The A-Team, in the middle of the 1982-1983 season. The show proved to be a hit and ranked no. 10 for the season. Happy Days dropped even further for its eleventh and final season. Part of this was perhaps due to the continued popularity of The A-Team, which ranked no. 4 for the year. Part of it may also have been because ABC moved Happy Days from its long-time 8:00 PM Eastern/7:00 PM Central time-slot on Tuesday to 8:30 PM Eastern/7:30 PM Central the same night. For the show's final season Ron Howard and Don Most returned as Richie and Ralph in guest appearances, the two characters having been discharged from the Army. In the finale, Joanie and Chachi get married and Fonzie adopts a boy. Ron Howard and Al Molinaro both guest starred on the episode. Curiously, the series finale was not quite a series finale. It aired on May 8 1984, after which ABC aired five unaired episodes from June to July.While Happy Days ended after eleven seasons, the show was hardly gone. The show would see success in syndication. The entire run of the show has been released on DVD. It has not only aired on local stations since its network run ended, but on cable channels such as TV Land and digital broadcast networks as MeTV. It is currently available on multiple streaming channels, including Paramount+, Pluto TV, YouTube, and Amazon Prime.It would also have a lasting impact on pop culture. The phrase \"jump the shark\" was coined by a college roommate of radio personality Jon Hein, Sean Connolly, for that point at which a show become unwatchable. The term came from the fifth season Happy Days episode \"Hollywood Part 3,\" in which Fonzie, clad in his leather jacket and swim trunks, jumps a shark while water skiing. Given Happy Days ranked no. 2 for the season and ran another six seasons, it is arguable that Happy Days did not jump the shark for most people when Fonzie jumped the shark. Happy Days is also responsible for the name of the TV trope \"Chuck Cunningham Syndrome,\" TV Tropes defines Chuck Cunningham Syndrome as being when a character disappears from a show without explanation (as was the case with Chuck). In 1994 the music video for the Weezer song \"Buddy Holly\" portrays the band playing at Arnold's Drive-In with a cameo by Al Molinaro as Al Delvecchio. The characters of Richie, Potsie, Ralph, Joanie, and Fonzie appear through incorporation of footage from Happy Days. In the song Fonzie is made to appear to dance to Weezer's performance though use of Casey Storm, the stylist for the video, acting as a body double for The Fonz. Amazingly enough, the illusion of Weezer performing at Arnold's in the late Fifties was achieved though camerawork and editing. No computer graphics was used.Happy Days would also result in two stage shows. Happy Days: The Arena Spectacular was an arena show that toured Australia in the late Nineties. Happy Days: A New Musical was a musical with a book by Garry Marshall and lyrics by Paul Williams. Happy Days: A New Musical premiered in 2008 the Falcon Theatre in Burbank, California. There have been various productions since then.After fifty years Happy Days remains popular. It remains one of the most successful shows to ever air on ABC. As I mentioned earlier, it is the network's second longest running sitcom. In 2023 Variety ranked Happy Days at no. 87 in their list of the 100 greatest shows of all time. The Fonz has regularly made lists of the greatest TV show characters of all time. Indeed, I  rather suspect even Zoomers even know who Fonzie is, even if they might have never seen an episode of the show.The 50th anniversary of Happy Days finds many in the curious position of being nostalgic about a show made in the Seventies that itself was nostalgic about the Fifties. Chances are good that people will still be watching Happy Days fifty years from now."},

Skal or even interacting with him online, but he was friends with many of my close friends. He was a guest three different times on my friend Karie Bible's YouTube series Hollywood Kitchen. Mr. Skal was congenial, knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and possessed considerable wit. I think I can speak for my fellow horror movie fans when I say that I could listen to David J. Skal all day.Of course, David J. Skal left an impressive mark as a cultural historian who chronicled horror movies. His books were always well-researched and detailed. What is more they were always written with considerable wit and good humour. No one could write about the classic Universal horror movies the way David J. Skal did, and he remains one of the best historians of the horror genre ever. Fangoria magazine described him as \"the Poet Laureate of Monster Kids,\" and I have no doubt that he was."},
{"title": "The Batman Effect: The Camp Craze on American Television in the 1960s", "date": "Friday, January 12, 2024", "text": "On January 12 1966 the television series Batman debuted on ABC. The show proved to be a smash hit from the beginning, a particular boon to perpetually low-rated ABC, especially given Batman aired twice a week (on Wednesday and Thursday night). It debuted on Wednesday to a phenomenal 27.3/49 rating, burying its competition on the other two networks (The Virginian on NBC and Lost in Space on CBS). It did even better on its second outing that Thursday night with a 29.6/59 rating. What is more, in the following weeks it continued to achieve extraordinary Nielsen ratings. Ultimately, Batman proved to be what might well be the biggest fad in the history of American television. A wide variety of Batman merchandise soon filled store shelves. There was everything from toys to games to Halloween costumes to a lunch box. In 1966 alone $150 million worth of Batman merchandise would be sold.It was in 1965 that ABC expressed interest in a Batman television series and contacted 20th Century Fox about producing the series. 20th Century Fox turned to William Dozier and his company Greenway Productions to actually produce the show. ABC had conceived of Batman as a serious, but tongue in cheek show, not unlike The Man From U.N.C.L.E. on rival network NBC. William Dozier had never read comic books in his life. Because of this, as research he read seven or eight Batman comic books. It occurred to Mr. Dozier that there was little chance that adults would take a series about a man dressed up as a bat seriously. He then struck upon the idea that Batman would operate on two levels. For adults it would be a comedy, an outright parody of comic books and their conventions. For children it would be an adventure show. It was for that reason that Batman was executed in an intentionally camp, Pop Art style. The heroes--Batman (Adam West) and his sidekick (Robin)--were exaggeratedly strait-laced. The villains were over the top. The show reproduced the look of Silver Age comic books on films, down to animated \"bams\" and \"pows\" during fight scenes. At the time William Dozier's choice to produce Batman in a camp, Pop Art style was a wise one. The art movement known as Pop Art was very much in fashion at the time, the movement being characterized by techniques drawn from commercial art, everyday objects, and, of course, comic books. The aesthetic style known as \"camp\" was also very much in vogue in the early to mid-Sixties. The concept of camp had existed for some time, but it was perhaps best defined by writer and critic Susan Sontag in her essay \"Notes on Camp,\" published in The Partisan Review in 1964. According to Susan Sontag, the most important elements of camp were \"...artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and ‘shocking’ excess.\" Significantly, In the March 21 1965 issue of The New York Times, Ms. Sontag declared Batman comic books to be an example of \"Low Camp.\" Radio show star and comedian Fred Allen has often been credited with the quote, \"Imitation is the sincerest form of television,\" This was quite certainly the case with Batman, whose success the American networks and television production companies rushed to emulate. Not only did the networks go forward with pilots that were very much in the mold of Batman, but even two existing shows were changed so they more resembled the smash hit of the 1965-1966 season. The fates of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and Lost in Space were sealed the moment Batman proved to be a hit. The Man From U.N.C.L.E was the first American television show to grow out of the spy craze of the Sixties. The show began development even before the James Bond movie Dr. No (1962) had been released. It debuted on NBC on Tuesday, September 22 1964. Initially The Man From U.N.C.L.E. struggled in the ratings, but following a move to Monday night at mid-season it not only became a hit, but a television fad not unlike Batman would be. The Man From U.N.C.L.E. merchandise from action figures to comic books to novels soon filled stores in 1964.The Man From U.N.C.L.E. centred on American Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn) and Russian Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum), agents for the international intelligence agency U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement). They answered to Alexander Waverly (Leo G. Carroll), the head of U.N.C.L.E. The chief opponent of U.N.C.L.E. was the criminal organization known as Thrush, a group that presented such a threat that even nations diametrically opposed to each other (such as the US and the U.S.S.R.) would band together to stop them. Originally The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was a serious, albeit tongue in cheek television show, not unlike the British television show The Avengers or the James Bond movies. It was after Batman debuted in 1966 that The Man From U.N.C.L.E. took on a much more comedic tone.Although the turn towards a camp style is associated with the show's third season, it had actually begun late in the second season of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. It was in the 28th episode of the second, \"The Bat Cave Affair,\" that Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin found themselves facing a Thrush agent called Count Zark (Martin Landau), who dressed and spoke like Dracula as played by Bela Lugosi. Count Zark's plot was to wreck air traffic control around the world using modified vampire bats. As if this wasn't enough, \"The Bat Cave Affair\" also features stereotypical hillbillies from the Ozarks. That \"The Bat Cave Affair\" was not an anomaly soon became apparent in the third season of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. The fourth episode of the third season, \"The Super-Colossal Affair,\" featured a notorious scene in which Illya Kuryakin rides a bomb filled with eau de skunk above the city of Las Vegas.Today precisely who was to blame for the dramatic change in the tone of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is hard to say. Although it is often blamed for the shift towards a camp style, it certainly was not the show's spinoff, The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. For one thing, the first episode to represent the change in tone for The Man From U.N.C.L.E., the above cited \"Bat Cave Affair,\" aired late in the show's second season, well before the debut of The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. Second, The Girl From U.N.C.L.E actually started on a more serious note than The Man From U.N.C.L.E. did its third season. It was a few episodes into its first and only season that The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. began to take on the more comedic tone of its parent show. It is apparent that The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. was simply following the lead of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.Many have placed the blame for the shift in the tone of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. on NBC. It has been alleged NBC wanted The Man From U.N.C.L.E. to have a lighter, more comedic tone, particularly in the wake of the success of Batman. It also seems possible that part of the blame may be borne by Boris Ingster, who took over as the producer of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. with the 20th episode of the second season (\"The Bridge of Lions Affair Part 1\"). Regardless of who was responsible for the shift towards camp, it seems clear that The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was trying to emulate Batman. Not only did the plots of episodes become sillier and the villains more outrageous, but the show even utilised personnel who had worked on Batman. Stanley Ralph Ross, a veteran writer on Batman, wrote episodes of The Man From U.N.C.L.E., in its third season. Directors George waGGner and Tom Gries, both of who directed several episodes of Batman, directed episodes of the third season of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. There is a good deal of substantial evidence to suggest that in its third season The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was trying to imitate Batman.What makes the shift in tone of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. sadder still is that the show had been very successful in its second season. For its second season the series ranked no. 13 in the Nielsen ratings for the year. With the change towards camp in its third season, not only was The Man From U.N.C.L.E. no longer in the top thirty shows for the year, but its ratings plummeted. An attempt to save The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was made for its fourth season, with the show once more becoming more serious. Unfortunately, it was too late to save the show. Its ratings did not recover and it was cancelled at mid-season.Like The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Lost in Space did not begin as an intentionally campy show. In its first season Lost in Space was a serious adventure show, in which the characters faced such natural disasters as heat waves and earthquakes. Lost in Space debuted on CBS on September 15 1965. It centred on the Robinson family, who find themselves lost in space when their spaceship, the Jupiter 2, is thrown off course. Accompanying the Robinson are Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonatha Harris), a saboteur for an enemy nation, and their robot. The first season of Lost in Space was shot in black and white. With its second season, not only was Lost in Space shot in colour, but it took a definite turn towards camp. In the second season of Lost in Space, the characters of Will (Bill Mumy), Penny (Angela Cartwright), the robot, and Dr. Smith took centre stage on the show.  The show took on a more comedic tone, with plots involving interstellar circuses, space cowboys, magicians, and so on. Villains on the show became more extravagant, not unlike the ones faced by the Caped Crusader. Episodes would even end on cliffhangers, complete with the caption, \"To be continued next week! Same time—same channel!\" The cliffhangers would disappear for the third season of Lost in Space, although the show would not become any more serious. In fact, what might be the most bizarre episode of Lost in Space (not to mention one of the most bizarre episodes of any show ever) aired in the third season as the show's penultimate episode. \"The Great Vegetable Rebellion\" saw Dr. Smith transformed into a giant stalk of celery and Penny into a flower bed by a giant, talking carrot.Like The Man From U.N.C.L.E., it is hard to say why Lost in Space shifted more towards a camp aesthetic, although it seems likely that it was an intentional attempt to compete with Batman. It is perhaps significant that Lost in Space aired directly opposite the Wednesday night episode of Batman. Regardless, the camp approach did not seem to hurt Lost in Space the way it did The Man From U.N.C.L..E. The show came in at no. 35 for the year in its first season, no. 44 in its second season, and no. 53 in its third season. While its ratings were not spectacular, they were not particularly poor either. When Lost in Space was cancelled with its third season, it was not because of the show's camp approach, but likely a combination of the show's rising costs and its ratings, particularly given a large percentage of the show's audience was children.The success of Batman also resulted in the debut of two superheroes shows, although both of them should be perhaps best be considered spoofs closer to Get Smart or F Troop than intentionally camp shows such as Batman or Lost in Space. Both shows debuted on the same night, January 9 1967. The first of the two to debut, at 8:00 PM Eastern on CBS, was Mr. Terrific. Mr. Terrific centred on gas station attendant Stanley Beamish (Stephen Strimpell), who is hired by the Bureau of Secret Projects to fight crime as Mr. Terrific. Mr. Terrific derived his super powers from a power pill that would only work on him. Mr. Terrific did not receive particularly good reviews, nor did it receive good ratings. It was ultimately cancelled at the end of the season.Immediately following Mr. Terrific on rival network NBC was Captain Nice. Captain Nice was created by Get Smart co-creator Buck Henry and starred William Daniels as police chemist Carter Nash, who developed a special formula that would give him superpowers. Despite its creator and its star (who would later become known for St. Elsewhere and Boy Meets World), Captain Nice did not receive particularly good reviews either. Just as both Mr. Terrific and Captain Nice debuted on the same night, both shows ended their runs on the same night as well, August 28 1967. In addition to changes to existing shows and the debut of new shows, the success of Batman would result in pilots that would use the camp aesthetic. The most significant of these came from William Dozier, the executive producer of Batman himself. Dick Tracy struck a middle ground between the campiness of Batman and the seriousness of Mr. Dozier's TV show The Green Hornet. Reportedly, the creator of Dick Tracy, Chester Gould, had been in talks with NBC about a Dick Tracy series in 1965, but nothing apparently came of it. It was in 1966 that William Dozier met with Chester Gould to discuss the possibility of a Dick Tracy show. By July 1 script writer Hal Fimberg joined Dozier to meet with Gould. It was on July 4th that Broadcasting magazine announced that 20th Century Fox and Greenway Productions (Dozier's company) had obtained the rights to Dick Tracy. It would be a half hour show airing at 7:30 PM Eastern/6:30 PM-Central on NBC. It would debut either midseason during the 1966/1967 season or the fall of 1967. By October 1966 actor Ray MacDonnell was cast as Dick Tracy.. The pilot was set to begin shooting on October 16, 1966.The pilot for the potential Dick Tracy series, \"The Plot to Destroy Nato,\" pitted Dick Tracy against the villain Mr. Memory (Victor Buono), who believes that he can communicate directly with computers through his mind. Both Davey Davison as Dick Tracy's wife Tess Trueheart and Eve Plumb as his daughter Bonnie Braids appear in the opening credits of \"The Plot to Destroy Nato,\" but not in the episode itself. In the pilot they are said to be visiting Tess's sister. The overall tone of the Dick Tracy pilot is different from either Batman or The Green Hornet. Unlike Batman the heroes and most other characters are played straight. Unlike The Green Hornet there are some elements of camp, namely in the form of the villain Mr. Memory as played by Victor Buono. One can only assume that Dick Tracy would have occupied a middle ground between Batman and The Green Hornet, where Dick Tracy, his family, and his fellow cops would have been played seriously and the villains would have been outrageous.Regardless, Dick Tracy as produced by William Dozier would never become a television series. Ultimately, NBC passed on Dick Tracy as a mid-season replacement during the 1966-1967 season. In February 1967, when NBC announced its schedule for that fall, Dick Tracy was conspicuously missing. It seems likely that the failure of Dick Tracy to be picked up as a series was due to the fact that by the middle of the 1966-1967 season Batman had dropped considerably in the Nielsen ratings from the phenomenal numbers it had in its first season. As far as NBC was concerned, the camp craze may have been over and so they passed on Dick Tracy. In 1966 Dick Tracy was not the only television show based on an existing property that William Dozier had planned. In fact, he had in mind a series based on another DC Comics character besides Batman, namely Wonder Woman. William Dozier never made a pilot for a Wonder Woman series, but he did make  five minute presentation film entitled \"Who's Afraid of Diana Prince?.\" Going by the presentation film, it seems likely that the tone of the Wonder Woman series Mr. Dozier had in mind would have been outright comedy rather than camp. Wonder Woman is played strictly for laughs. Diana Prince (Ellie Wood Walker) is portrayed as a shy plain Jane whose mother (who is not Hippolyta of the Amazons) nags her about not having a boyfriend. When she dons the Wonder Woman costume, she sees herself in the mirror as being more attractive than she really is (the Wonder Woman in the mirror is played by Linda Harrison, later of Planet of the Apes fame). It seems likely that the reason William Dozier's Wonder Woman series never made it beyond the presentation film was not due to ratings for Batman falling, but instead because \"Who's Afraid of Diana Prince?\" was just plain bad. William Dozier was not the only producer reviving old properties for television. What is more, not every television project based on an old property was from the Thirties and Forties like Batman and Dick Tracy. One property selected for revival in the Sixties dated back to 1914. The Perils of Pauline was a 1914 serial starring Pearl White as an heiress who constantly finds herself in danger. What is more, the first attempt to revive The Perils of Pauline as  a television series pre-dated Batman by three years. In 1962 Warner Bros. sought to produce a pilot for a situation comedy based on The Perils of Pauline starring Dorothy Provine and John Dehner. It seems possible that the pilot never came to be, as Dorothy Provine was focused on a career in movies and refused to star in the prospective television series.The second attempt to adapt The Perils of Pauline as a television series came about before Batman even debuted. In the October 23 1965 issue of The Salem News, in the column \"Between Channels\" by Richard Doan, among producer Herbert B. Leonard's planned pilots for television series was The Perils of Pauline, which was described as \"...'a wild and contemporary' updating of the early movie cliffhanger serial of the same name.\" If the name Herbert B. Leonard sounds familiar, it is because he produced the classic TV series Naked City and produced and co-created the classic show Route 66 with writer Stirling Sillipant. Herbert B. Leonard had apparently had the idea for a television show based on The Perils of Pauline for some time. In a  June 27 1967 article in The Edwards Intelligencer, it was stated that he had been searching for \"the right Pauline\" for five years.Herbert B. Leonard found his Pauline in the form of actress Pamela Austin. Pamela Austin had made several guest appearances on television, most notably in the Twilight Zone episode \"Number 12 Looks Just Like You.\" She had also appeared opposite Elvis Presley in the movies Blue Hawaii (1961) and Kissin' Cousins (1964). It was not until 1966 that Pamela Austin really began to be noticed, starring in a series of commercials for the car company Dodge as part of their \"Dodge Rebellion\" campaign. The commercials would place Miss Austin in various dangerous situations, such as nearly falling off a cliff, almost being crushed by a chandelier, being menaced by sharks, and so on. It was one night that Herbert B. Leonard saw one of Pamela Austin's \"Dodge Rebellion\" commercials on television that he decided he had found the Pauline for his prospective TV show based on The Perils of Pauline. Pat Boone was cast as Pauline's love interest (and the person who is constantly trying to rescue her) George Stedman.  As to the concept for the series, it was relatively simple. Pauline was an orphan who constantly finds herself in dangerous situations.Sources seem to be unclear as to whether a single pilot was made for The Perils of Pauline with two additional sample episodes also shot, or whether the pilot was reworked three times. Either way, in the end there were three completed episodes of The Perils of Pauline. It as written by Albert Beich, who had created the short-lived television series Kentucky Jones and co-wrote the screenplay for the Bette Davis movie Dead Ringer (1964). The original director was Ken Annakin, who had directed such films as Miranda (1948), The Sword and the Rose (1953), and Swiss Family Robinson (1960). He left the pilot after only 18 days. The Perils of Pauline was then directed by producer Herbert B. Leonard himself and Joshua Shelley, an actor who had made guest appearances on television shows from Philco Television Playhouse to The Defenders.Ultimately, CBS decided not to pick up The Perils of Pauline as a series. While it seems clear that many projects done with a camp aesthetic were not picked up due to the declining fortunes of Batman, this was probably not the case with The Perils of Pauline. At the time CBS decided not to pick up The Perils of Pauline, Batman was still riding high in the ratings. It was then that Universal decided to release The Perils of Pauline as a feature film. The three completed episodes of The Perils of Pauline were stitched together, with additional footage shot in December 1966. The film was released in 1967. It was not well-received by critics, nor did it do particularly well at the box office. This could well point to the reason that CBS did not go forward with the television series The Perils of Pauline. It simply was not very good.While The Perils of Pauline was conceived only a few months before the debut of Batman on ABC, it seems likely The Perils of Pauline was influenced by both Batman and  the hit movie The Great Race (1965). The direction of The Perils of Pauline was apparently meant to simulate silent movies or, more accurately, what people in 1966 thought silent movies were like. There is colourful title cards, undercranking the camera, and old-style organ music. At the same time it would appear to owe a bit to Batman. It is shot in vivid Technicolor. There are florid villains and over-the-top situations. Everything is exaggerated and done in a camp style.While The Perils of Pauline drew upon a silent movie serial for inspiration, Old Time Radio would provide inspiration for another prospective show with a camp aesthetic. I Love a Mystery was a popular radio show that aired on NBC from 1939 to 1944. It was created by Carlton E. Morse, who had also created the popular radio soap opera One Man's Family. I Love a Mystery centred on private detectives Jack Packard, Doc Long, and Reggie York. Jack was more or less their leader, who was the best at solving mysteries. Doc Long was the comedian of the group, a large, high-spirited Texan. Reggie York was an Englishman who was exceptionally strong and skilled at combat. The three men comprised the A-1 Detective Agency, whose cases involved everything from the jungles of Indochina to ancient mansions. I Love a Mystery blended the genres of adventure, mystery, and horror. The radio show was popular enough to inspire three movies produced by Columbia Pictures (I Love a Mystery in 1945 and The Devil's Mask and The Unknown in 1946). It would also be revived twice on radio, as I Love Adventure on ABC in 1948 and I Love a Mystery on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1949.It was in a November 25 1966 article by Associated Press movie and television writer Bob Thomas that Jennings Lang of Universal discussed television movies that were being produced for NBC under the network's \"World Premiere Movie\" banner. Some of these television movies would serve as pilots for television series, including I Love a Mystery with Les Crane, Ironside with Raymond Burr, and Outsider with Darren McGavin or Harry Guardino. Both Ironside with Raymond Burr and The Outsider with Darren McGavin would go onto become television series on NBC. In a December 11 1966 article in The Register, it was reported that Don Knotts would have a cameo in the I Love a Mystery TV movie, and that Les Crane and David Hartman starred on the show. A January 28 1967 article in The Kingston Daily Freeman discussed Ida Lupino playing her role as a mad scientist in the NBC World Premiere movie I Love a Mystery. The TV movie I Love a Mystery was directed and written by Leslie Stevens, best known as the creator of the classic television series The Outer Limits. Leslie Stevens's teleplay was based on two episodes of the radio show I Love a Mystery. \"The Fear That Creeps Like a Cat\" dealt with the disappearance of Alexander Archer. In \"The Thing That Cries in the Night\" Jack, Doc, and Reggie find themselves dealing with three beautiful women and a mysterious mansion. Les Crane played Jack Packard. Les Crane may be best known as the first talk show host to challenge Johnny Carson's supremacy with his talk show on ABC from 1964 to 1965. David Hartman played Doc Long. Although not well-known at the time, he would go on to have a regular role on The Virginian and become a long time host on Good Morning America. Hagan Beggs played Reggie York. Hagan Beggs made frequent guest apperances, on American television, and was later a regular on the Canadian television series Danger Bay. Legendary actress Ida Lupino played the antagonist of the pilot, Randolph \"Randy\" Cheyne, while Don Knotts had a cameo in the pilot.In Bob McKenzie's May 18 1967 column in The Oakland Tribune, it is mentioned that Les Crane co-stars in I Love a Mystery, a two hour television movie that may be released in theatres instead. As it turned out, I Love a Mystery would not be picked up as a TV series, nor would the TV movie ever be released to theatres. In fact, the TV movie I Love a Mystery would not see the light of day until it aired on NBC on February 27 1973, six years after it had been filmed. While it is hard to say why NBC waited so long to air the TV movie, it seems likely that it was not picked up as a TV series simply because the camp craze was obvioulsy over by the time the TV movie was completed. Indeed, by the time the TV movie/pilot was announced in the fall of 1966, Batman was no longer the ratings behemoth it had been.As it was, I Love a Mystery was very much in the mold of Batman. The situaitons in I Love a Mystery were not nearly as exaggerated as those on Batman, but they were exaggerated nonetheless. As the villain Randolph Cheyne, Ida Lupino is only a little more restrained than the villains on Batman.  I Love a Mystery even features a narrator early in the film. Ultimately, it plays less like a faithful adaptation of a radio show from the days of Old Time Radio than a parody of such. In the end, the camp craze on American television in the mid Sixties abated without ever becoming a full-fledged cycle of camp television shows.  Much of this was due to the fact that the camp craze was very much tied to the fortunes of Batman. While Batman would prove sucessful in syndicaiton as a rerun and today is regarded as a classic, in the winter and spring of 1966 it was very much a fad. And like all fads, it ended almost as quickly as it began. Once Batman was no longer a ratings giant, the networks lost interest in pursuing similar shows. This was probably part of the reason that Dick Tracy, The Perils of Pauline, and I Love a Mystery were not picked up. Of course, the other reason why some of the campy pilots made in the wake of Batman were not picked up as TV series was simply a matter of quality. The camp aesthetic depends largely on a precarious balance of going over the top without going too far. Paricularly in its first season, Batman was able to maintain that balance. The pilot for Perils of Pauline was not. In other words, in some cases campy pilots did not become TV shows simply because they were not very good (or \"so bad they're good,\" as the case may be). After the mid-Sixties, American television would never be nearly overtaken by camp, although it would not disappear completely. The first season of the Seventies series Wonder Woman was much like the 1966 pilot for Dick Tracy in that the primary characters were treated seriously while episodes of the show had some camp aspects (it is to be noted that veteran Batman writer Stanley Ralph Ross developed Wonder Woman for television). Still later Twin Peaks, Xena: Warrior Princess, Riverdale, and a few assorted other shows would make use of camp to one degree or another. The camp craze on American telvision in the Sixties was brief, but its effects are still felt to this day."},
{"title": "The 65th Anniversary of Rawhide", "date": "Tuesday, January 9, 2024", "text": "Today Rawhide may be best known as the television show that launched Clint Eastwood on his path towards stardom, although it deserves to be remembered for much more than that. Rawhide was highly successful in its early years and ultimately ran for eight seasons, making it the fifth longest running Western television show on broadcast network television after Gunsmoke, Bonanza, The Virginian, and Wagon Train. It proved popular as a rerun in syndication. It has run on such cable channels as the Family Channel, the Hallmark Channel, Encore Western, and AMC, as well as such broadcast outlets as MeTV. Even its theme song, \"Rawhide,\" has held up over time, having been covered by various artists multiple times.Rawhide centred on a cattle drive from San Antonio, Texas to Sedalia, Missouri in the late 1860s. The trail boss was Gil Favor (Eric Fleming), a tough, but fair man who had worked with cattle for most of his life. Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood) was the ramrod on the cattle drive, essentially Mr. Favor's right-hand man who acted as the foreman on the drive. Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley) was the original scout on the cattle drive, who looked for water for the cattle and places where they could camp for the night. Wishbone (Paul Brinegar) was the drive's cook, and Mushy (James Murdock) was his assistant. Hey Soos Patines (Robert Cabal) was the drive's wrangler, who was responsible for taking care of the horses on the drive.Rawhide followed Gil Favor's cattle drive as it made its way from San Antonio to Sedalia. Plots on the show ranged from natural disasters (such as drought, wolves, or anthrax outbreaks) to bandits to dishonest townsfolk. Rawhide was known for its realism, with a good deal of cowboy jargon making its way on the show. The man who drove the cattle were \"drovers.\" The cattle were \"beeves (the plural of \"beef\"). The remuda was the herd of horses used by the drovers. Particularly in its early seasons, Rawhide was grounded in reality in a way the majority of television Westerns were not.Rawhide was created by Charles Marquis Warren. who was well-established as a writer, director, and producer of Westerns. Indeed, it was Charles Marquis Warren who developed the radio show Gunsmoke for television and served as its producer in its first seasons and part of its second. Charles Marquis Warren directed the 1958 movie Cattle Empire, starring Joel McCrea as the trail boss of a cattle drive. For Cattle Empire Charles Marquis Warren relied heavily on the 1946 novel The Chisholm Trail by Borden Chase, which served as the basis for the 1948 Western movie Red River and the 1866 diary of cattle drive trail boss George C. Duffield. It occurred to Charles Marquis Warren that a cattle drive in the 1860s could provide the basis for a television series.Ultimately, Rawhide owed a good deal to the movie Cattle Empire. Endre Bohem, who co-wrote the screenplay for Cattle Empire, was hired as the story editor on Rawhide and wrote episodes of the show. Paul Brinegar, who played one of the cattle drive's cooks in Cattle Drive, played the cook Wishbone on Rawhide. Both Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan, who played drovers Jim Quince and Joe Scarlet on Rawhide, had roles in Cattle Empire. Another veteran of Cattle Empire, Charles H. Gray, would guest star in two episodes of Rawhide in its first and second seasons would play the regular role of drover Clay Forrester on Rawhide in its fourth and fifth seasons.The first season of Rawhide was budgeted at $4 million, with much of that money going towards guest stars on the show. The outdoors scenes with cattle were filmed near Tucumcari, New Mexico, which also happened to be the hometown of Paul Brinegar. Other filming locations for the show ranged from Big Sky Ranch in Simi Valley to Conejo Valley. Scenes were also filmed at Universal Studios in Universal City and CBS Studio Centre in Los Angeles. Making Rawhide could be gruelling for both the cast and crew. Roughly one episode was produced each week with breaks of three to four months between seasons. One of the best remembered aspects of Rawhide is its theme song. \"Rawhide\" was written by lyricist Ned Washington and composer Dmitri Tiomkin. It was sung by popular vocalist Frankie Laine. The song proved popular, reaching no. 6 on the UK singles chart and no. 34 on the Australian singles chart. While it did not reach the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, it proved successful nonetheless. It would be covered by such diverse artists as Johnny Western, The Dead Kennedys, and The Blues Brothers.Rawhide would see a good deal of turnover in its producers over the years. Charles Marquis Warren did not remain with television shows very long, but he remained with Rawhide for three seasons, which was longer than his stints on Gunsmoke or The Virginian. Story editor Endre Bohem became the show's producer in its fourth season. Vincent M. Fennelly, who had produced movies at Monogram and Allied Artists as well s the TV show Trackdown, served as the producer on Rawhide for its fifth and sixth seasons. Bruce Geller, now best known as the creator of Mission: Impossible, and Bernard L. Kowalski, would produce 21 episodes of the show's seventh season. Messrs. Geller and Kowalski's stint on Rawhide was unlike anything on the show before, or any other Western television series for that matter. Indeed, in many of their episodes no cattle were in sight. One person who did not approve of the direction Rawhide was taking was William S. Paley, the head of CBS. Mr. Paley fired Bruce Geller, Bernard L. Kowalski, and story editor Del Reisman in December 1964 and gave an order \"...to put the cows back in.\" Endre Bohem returned as producer following Bruce Geller and Bernard L. Kowalski. For the eighth and final season Ben Brady, who had worked on Perry Mason,  was brought in as an executive producer and Robert E. Thompson as its line producer. While Rawhide saw a good deal of turnover in producers, its cast was fairly stable. Sheb Wooley left after the show's fourth season, only to return for a few episodes in its seventh season. Don C. Harvey, as drover Collins, also left after the show's fourth season. Others would only stay for a few seasons. John Erwin as Teddy appeared from the second to fourth seasons, and then again from the sixth to seventh seasons. As mentioned above, Charles H. Gray played Clay Forrester in the show's fourth and fifth seasons, and had a single appearance in the show's sixth season. The biggest cast change would come when Eric Fleming departed the show at the end of the seventh season. Today it is unclear why he left. At the time Eric Fleming joked to TV Guide, \"They fired me because they were paying me a million dollars a year (here it must be pointed out he was actually paid $220,000 a year).\" Of course, Eric Fleming was not the only cast member to leave Rawhide after its seventh season, as several cast members were let go. Robert Cabal, James Murdock, Rocky Shahan, and others were no longer part of the cast. The eighth season of Rawhide appears to be set a few years later than the sixth season, with Rowdy Yates promoted to trail boss and Jim Quince promoted to ramrod. Paul Brinegar remained on the show as Wishbone. The departing cast were replaced by new drovers, including Raymond St. Jacques as Simon Blake (the show's first regular Black drover),  John Ireland as Jed Colby, and David Watson as Ian Cabot. For the first three seasons of Rawhide, while Charles Marquis Warren was producer, the titles of episodes followed a format of \"Incident at....,\" \"Incident of...,\" and so on. This was dropped at the start of the fourth season. Episodes of Rawhide sometimes addressed serious issues, such as drug addiction, alcoholism, racism, and superstition. In \"Incident at the Top of the World\" Robert Culp played a Civil War veteran who had become addicted to morphine. Hey Soos faced racism in multiple episodes. Episodes such as \"Incident of the Golden Calf\" and 'Incident of the Prophecy\" touched upon religion. Rawhide also featured a wide range of big name guest stars. The seventh season episode \"Canliss\" featured a rare television guest appearance by Dean Martin as the titledcharacter. In the fourth season episode \"The Captain's Wife,\"screen legend Barbara Stanwyck played the wife of a cavalry captain left in charge of an abandoned fort facing Comanchero raids. Troy Donahue played a man about to be married in \"Incident at Alabaster Plain.\" A short list of big name guest stars on Rawhide includes Claude Akins, Eddie Albert, Mary Astor, Ed Begley, Lon Chaney Jr., Ann Doran, Barbara Eden, Nina Foch, Martin Landau, June Lockhart, Burgess Meredith, Woody Strode, and Audrey Totter.During its run Rawhide would see some merchandising. In 1961 a novel based on the TV show, Rawhide, by Frank C. Robertson, was published by Signet Books.Two issues of Dell Comics' anthology comic book Four Color adapted the TV series. There was also a board game, puzzle, and various other goods.Rawhide proved to be a hit in its very first season, coming in at no. 28 for the year in the Nielsen ratings. It rose in the ratings in its second season to no. 18 for the year and peaked no. 6 in its third season. Rawhide dropped to no. 13 for the season in its fourth season and then to no. 22 in its fifth. Unfortunately, its fifth season would be the last time Rawhide ranked in the top thirty shows for the year. For the show's sixth season CBS moved Rawhide from Friday night to Thursday night, and its ratings dropped. Rawhide was moved back to Friday night for its seventh season, but its ratings continued to decline. With its eighth season Rawhide moved from Friday night to Tuesday night. Between the new time slot and the massive changes in the show's cast, ratings for Rawhide plummeted. The show was cancelled only thirteen episodes into its eighth season.While Rawhide ended its original broadcast network run in 1965, it was hardly gone. It entered syndication and would be seen on local television stations for years. It would later be seen on a wide variety of cable channels. The entire series has been released on DVD by CBS DVD. Rawhide would have a lasting impact. The fourth season episode \"The Black Sheep\" was the one that led director Sergio Leone to cast Clint Eastwood in his Western A Fistful of Dollars (1964), thus launching Eastwood on his film career. Its theme song has become a standard, recorded by multiple artists. While he was fired from the job, Rawhide was among the first shows produced by Bruce Geller, who would go onto create Mission: Impossible and produce the TV series Mannix. Rawhide also brought a higher degree of realism to television Westerns and, for the brief time that Bruce Geller and Bernard L. Kowalski produced it, even pioneered the revisionist Western. Rawhide may not have seen the success of Gunsmoke and Bonanza, but in some way it was just as influential."},
{"title": "The Hollywood Palace Turned 60", "date": "Saturday, January 6, 2024", "text": "Today the television variety show The Hollywood Palace is perhaps only remembered by those of a certain age and fans of classic television, as well as television and music historians. While it may not be well remembered today, it was very much a success while it was on the air. The Hollywood Palace boasted guests ranging from such classic movie stars as Ginger Rogers to popular comedians such as Bob Newhart to acrobats to rock acts such as Paul Revere & The Raiders. While it never ranked in the top thirty shows for the year, it received respectable ratings, particularly for the then struggling network ABC. Ultimately, it ran for seven seasons. The Hollywood Palace debuted on January 4 1964, so that the show just turned sixty.The origins of The Hollywood Palace can actually be traced back to a show on an entirely different network, namely the late night show Tonight on NBC. It was in 1962 that popular host Jack Paar left Tonight. Johnny Carson, who had hosted his own short-lived variety show, The Johnny Carson Show, on CBS and was then the host of the game show Who Do You Trust? on ABC, was chosen as Jack Paar's successor as the host of Tonight (even then referred to informally as The Tonight Show). NBC would have to wait for Johnny Carson, as his contractual obligations to ABC and Who Do You Trust? producer Don Fedderson would not make him available to host The Tonight Show until October 1 1962. In the interim NBC relied on a number of guest hosts on The Tonight Show, a short list of which included Joey Bishop, Jack Carter, Bob Cummings,  Jimmy Dean, Arlene Francis, Art Linkletter, and Groucho Marx. Among these guest hosts was actor and comedian Jerry Lewis, who hosted The Tonight Show for two weeks. Jerry Lewis's stint as a guest host on The Tonight Show proved so successful that NBC, CBS, and ABC made offers to Lewis to star in his own show. ABC won in the end, although at a substantial cost.Jerry Lewis signed a contract for $8 million per season with forty-two episodes a year with ABC. The contract also gave Jerry Lewis complete creative control. For the talk and variety show, The El Capitan Theatre (now the Avalon Hollywood), at one time home to The Colgate Comedy Hour, Truth or Consequences, and This Is Your Life, was completely renovated at an enormous cost, and renamed The Jerry Lewis Theatre. Ultimately, The Jerry Lewis Show, a two-hour talk and variety show airing on Saturday night, would be the most expensive variety show in the history of American television.Unfortunately, The Jerry Lewis Show would also be a complete and utter failure. It debuted on September 21 1963 to largely hostile reviews. Worse yet, while the first episode of the show did well enough in the Nielsens, the ratings dropped precipitously over the next few weeks. It was then on November 10 1963, less than two months after it had debuted, that ABC announced that The Jerry Lewis Show had been cancelled. The cancellation did cost ABC dearly, as they had to buy out Jerry Lewis's contract. The star walked away with around $10 million, although some have claimed it was even more.The debacle that was The Jerry Lewis Show left ABC in a bit of a lurch. Not only had they spent an extraordinarily huge amount of money on a show that bombed, but they were now left with nothing to air on Saturday night at 9:30 PM Eastern/8:30 PM Central. ABC partially rectified this problem by giving the 10:30 PM Eastern/9:30 PM Central back to their local affiliates. As to the hour beginning at 9:30 PM/8:30 PM, it would now be occupied by a hastily thrown together variety show. What was once The El Capitan and then The Jerry Lewis Theatre was renamed The Hollywood Palace, which was also the name of ABC's new variety show replacing The Jerry Lewis Show.The Hollywood Palace differed from other variety shows of the era in that it did not have a regular host, and instead used a different host each week. Legendary crooner Bing Crosby hosted The Hollywood Palace more than anyone else, a total of 32 times (including the Christmas editions of the show). Other notable hosts on the show included Jack Benny, Milton Berle, Ernest Bognine, Joan Crawford, Bob Cummings, Bette Davis, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Betty Grable, Dean Martin, Debbie Reynolds, Phil Silvers, and Adam West. As might be expected, when he hosted the March 7 1964 edition of The Hollywood Palace, Dean Martin had to take a poke at his former partner, remarking that he would like to thank Jerry Lewis for \"...building me this theatre.\" Among the regulars on the show would be one who would soon be famous. For a time Raquel Welch served as the show's \"Billboard Girl,\" who was responsible for placing the names of the acts on placards. Dick Tufeld served as the show's off-screen announcer.The Hollywood Palace has often been compared to The Ed Sullivan Show in the variety of acts booked on the show. That having been said, The Hollywood Palace was able to book acts that Ed Sullivan never could. An adjacent parking lot was sometimes used for trapeze and high-wire acts that The Ed Sullivan Theatre in New York City could never accommodate. The fact that The Hollywood Palace was in Hollywood was another advantage it had over The Ed Sullivan Show.Quite simply, being located in Los Angeles, acts could be easily flown in from Las Vegas, giving the show access to many comedians and musicians. Regardless, The Hollywood Palace featured a wide variety of acts throughout its run. Stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood were represented on the show by such legends as Dan Dailey, Bette Davis, Ann Miller, Jane Powell, and Cesar Romero. Several popular comedians appeared on the show, including Burns & Schreiber, Jack Carter, Shecky Greene, Pat Morita, Bob Newhart, and Rowan & Martin. Among the most frequent acts on the show was the performing elephants Bertha and Tina. Also appearing on The Hollywood Palace were such novelty acts as the acrobats the Hardy Family, The Berosini Chimps, The Flying Wallendas, and Les Salvadori (an Italian clown troupe).For the first season Les Brown and His Band of Renown served as the show's house band. Starting with its second season and for the rest of its run, Mitchell Ayres and His Orchestra were the house band on The Hollywood Palace. The show featured a number of notable singers, including Rosemary Clooney, Mary Costa, Vic Damone, Nat King Cole,Eydie Gormé, and Nancy Wilson. Of course, today The Hollywood Palace may be best remembered for the American television debut of The Rolling Stones. Unfortunately, that debut was less than pleasant for The Stones. The host of the night Dean Martin made the band the butt of several jokes. While The Rolling Stones recorded two songs, ultimately only 45 seconds of the band would make it into the June 13 1964 edition of the show. Fortunately, for The Rolling Stones, their second song (a cover of Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away\") would air on the second episode of the second season without ridicule. Ultimately, The Hollywood Palace would feature several rock and R&B acts, including The 5th Dimension, Buffalo Springfield, The Jackson 5, The Mamas & the Papas, Paul Revere & The Raiders, The Supremes, The Turtles, and We Five. While The Beatles never appeared on The Hollywood Palace, their promotional films for \"Penny Lane\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" were shown on the February 25 1967 edition of the show.Ratings for The Hollywood Palace  dropped in its seventh season, perhaps due to competition from Mannix on CBS and NBC Saturday Night at the Movies on NBC. ABC then cancelled the show, with its last edition airing on February 7 1970. Fittingly enough, it was hosted by Bing Crosby, who had also hosted the first edition of the show. Sadly, very little has been seen of The Hollywood Palace ever since. The residuals for the many performers on the show, not to mention union contract fees for musicians, simply made it too expensive to be syndicated as a rerun. PBS aired a compilation of clips from The Hollywood Palace on December 16 2004 titled Christmas at the Hollywood Palace. There are clips from the show to be found on YouTube and there are also several unofficial DVD releases. It is not available on any streaming service.Ultimately, The Hollywood Palace was much more than a hastily thrown together replacement for the failed Jerry Lewis Show or a knock-off of The Ed Sullivan Show. It was a showcase of acts ranging from stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood to current comedians and rock acts to novelty acts such as dancing elephants and performing chimps Although remembered only by a few and currently unavailable, the show has a definite place in television history. One can only hope that the entire series will become widely available one day."},
{"title": "The Late Great Glynis Johns", "date": "Friday, January 5, 2024", "text": "In some ways the term \"legend\" seems insufficient to describe Glynis Johns. She had success in motion pictures, on Broadway, and on television. She appeared in such movies as Miranda (1948), The Court Jester (1955),. The Sundowners (1960), and Mary Poppins (1964). On Broadway she originated the song \"Send in the Clowns\" in the production A Little Night Music, a song that Stephen Sondheim wrote specifically for her. On television she made numerous guest appearances, and starred on the shows Glynis and Coming of Age. Glynis Johns was nothing if not prolific and she had a particularly long career. Miss Johns died yesterday, January 4 2024, at the age of 100.Glynis Johns was born on October 5 1923 in Pretoria, Union of South Africa to acting royalty. Her father was legendary Welsh actor Mervyn Jones, now known for such movies as Jamaica Inn (1939), Dead of Night (1945), and Scrooge (1951). Her mother was concert pianist Alice Steele-Wareham. Glynis Johns's mother gave birth to her while she was on tour. Glynis Johns took to entertainment while she was still very young. She was five years old when she enrolled in the London Ballet School. By the time she was ten years old she had already earned over two dozen gold medals in dance from competitions throughout England. In addition to being a trained dancer, Glynis Johns was also a skilled pianist and singer.Glynis Johns was only 13 years old when she made her film debut in South Riding in 1938. In the late Thirties she also appeared in the films Murder in the Family (1938), Prison Without Bars (1938), On the Night of the Fire (1939), Under Your Hat (1940), The Briggs Family (1940), and The Thief of Bagdad (1940). It was in the Forties that she achieved stardom. She appeared with her father, Mervyn Johns, playing his daughter, in the movie The Halfway House (1944). In 1948 she starred as the mermaid of the title in the enormously popular movie Miranda. Glynis Johns would play Miranda twice more, in a cameo in the movie Helter Skelter (1949) and in the film Mad About Men (1951), which Rank Films insisted was not a sequel despite the fact that Glynis Johns played the same character as in Miranda. During the Forties she also appeared in the movies The Prime Minister (1941), 49th Parallel (1941), The Adventures of Tartu (1943), Perfect Strangers (1945), This Man is Mine (1946), Frieda (1947), An Ideal Husband (1947), Third Time Lucky (1949), Dear Mr. Prohack (1949), and State Secret (1950).By the Fifties Glynis Johns was an established star. She appeared in two swashbucklers made by Disney, The Sword and the Rose (1953) and Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue (1953).  She was the female lead in the classic comedy The Court Jester (1955). She also appeared with her father in The Magic Box (1951) and The Sundowners (1960), for which she was nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. She also appeared in such films as Flesh and Blood (1951), No Highway in the Sky (1951), Appointment with Venus (1951), Encore (1951), The Card (1952), Personal Affair (1953), The Weak and the Wicked (1954), The Seekers (1954), The Beachcomber (1954), Josephine and Men (1955), Loser Takes All (1956), Around the World in 80 Days (1956), All Mine to Give (1957), Another Time, Another Place (1958), Shake Hands with the Devil (1959), and The Spider's Web (1960).In the Sixties Glynis Johns played what may be her best known role, that of suffragette Mrs. Banks in Mary Poppins (1964). She also appeared in the controversial movie The Chapman Report (1962) and the comedy Dear Brigette (1965). She also appeared in the movies The Cabinet of Caligari (1962), Papa's Delicate Condition (1963), Don't Just Stand There (1968), and Lock Up Your Daughters! (1969).  In the Seventies Glynis Johns appeared in the movies Under Milk Wood (1971), The Vault of Horror (1973), and Three Dangerous Ladies (1977). She provided the voice of Swallow in the animated short \"The Happy Prince\" (1974). From the Eighties through the Nineties, she appeared in the movies Nukie (1987), Zelly and Me (1988), The Ref (1994), While You Were Sleeping (1995), and Superstar (1999).As mentioned earlier, Glynis Johns also had a career on the stage, and she appeared on stage while she was still a child. She was eight years old when she appeared in the play Judgement Day at the Phoenix Theatre in London. In the Thirties she also appeared on the British stages in the short play St. Helena at The Old Vic in London, as well as The Children's Hour, The Melody That Got Lost, and Quiet Wedding. In the Forties Glynis Johns appeared on stage in the play Quiet Weekend at the Wyndham Theatre in London and once more in Judgement Day (this time in an older role) at the Phoenix Theatre. She was only played the title character in a production of the play Peter Pan a the Cambridge Theatre in London. She also appeared in the plays I'll See You Again in 1944 and Fools Rush In in 1946.Glynis Johns made her debut on Broadway in the title role in Gertie in 1952. She also appeared on Broadway in Major Barbara from 1956 to 1957. In the Sixties she appeared on the West End in he King's Mare at the Garrick Theatre. In 1963 she appeared on Broadway in Too Good to Be True. In the Seventies she appeared on Broadway in A Little Night Music and The Circle. In London she appeared in Come as You Are and 13 Rue de l'Amour. She also appeared in various productions elsewhere. Glynis Johns also had an extensive television career. She made her television debut in 1952 in an episode of Studio One. In the Fifties she made guest appearances on Lux Video Theatre, The Errol Flynn Theatre, and The Frank Sinatra Show. In the Sixties she had her own short-lived sitcom on CBS, Glynis. She played Glynis Granville, a mystery writer who solves mysteries with the help of her husband, defence attorney Keith Granville (Keith Andes). Glynis Johns played the villain Lady Penlope Peasoup in a multi-part episode of Batman, with with Rudy Vallée as her brother Lord Marmaduke Ffogg. She also guest starred on the shows Adventures in Paradise, The Roarings 20's, General Electric Theatre, Naked City, The Dick Powell Show, Dr. Kildare, The Beachcomber, Saints and Sinners, The DuPont Show of the Week, The Lloyd Bridges Show, Burke's Law,The Defenders, 12 O' Clock High, and ITV Playhouse. In the Eighties Glynis Johns was a regular on the show Coming of Age. She guest starred in an episode of Cheers as the mother of Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). She also guest starred on The Love Boat; Murder, She Wrote; and The Cavanaughs, She appeared in the mini-series She provided a voice for the animated TV movie Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School. Glynis Johns appeared in the mini-series Little Gloria...Happy at Last and Le crime d'Ovide Plouffe. In the Nineties she played the voice of Darjeeng in an ABC Weekend Special adaptation of The Secret Garden.Glynis Johns was that rarest of people, a true multi-talent. She could act. She could dance. She could sing. And she could play piano. Chances are good that Glynis Johns will always be best remembered as Mrs. Banks in Mary Poppins, the easy-distracted wife and mother who is at the same time a devoted suffragette. While this may be the case, she played a wide variety of roles. She will also be remembered as the flirtatious mermaid Miranda in the movie of the same name and the film Mad for Men. In contrast, she played the femme fatale Joan Burns in Third Time Luck, who finds herself caught between two gamblers. In The Chapman Report she played housewife Teresa Harnish, who finds herself lusting after a younger football player (Ty Hardin). She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for The Sundowners  for good reason. As Mrs. Firth, the loud, overly talkative, and flirtatious owner of the local pub, she is easily one of the best parts of the film. She also shined as Maid Jean, easily described as a female Robin Hood, in The Court Jester. Glynis Johns also did well in her many television roles. She was one of the best villains on Batman, playing the diabolical Penelope Peasoup. In the Naked City episode \"The Hot Minerva\" she played a museum curator whose museum has been the victim of theft. In The Defenders episode \"The Thief,\" Glynis Johns played Catherine Collins, a kleptomaniac facing life imprisonment. Of course, Glynis Johns also had a very successful stage career, and won the Tony Award for Best Actress of a Musical for her role as Desiree Armfeldt.Glynis Johns was a singular talent who played a wide variety of roles over the years. If she was so prolific and her career was so long, it was because of her enormous presence as an actress and her ability to transform herself into a wide variety of characters. It's not many actors who played everything from a mermaid to a suffragette to femme fatales."},
{"title": "The 40th Anniversary of Night Court", "date": "Thursday, January 4, 2024", "text": "Night Court was among the most successful sitcoms of the Eighties. It ran for nine seasons, and for four of those seasons it numbered among the top twenty shows each year. It was nominated for several Emmy Awards and won four awards. Following its broadcast network run, Night Court found success as a syndicated rerun on both local stations and cable channels. In the long run Night Court would see more success than many shows that were higher rated during their network runs.Night Court centred on the night shift of a Manhattan Criminal Court. It was presided over by an unconventional, young judge, Harry T. Stone (Harry Anderson), who was an amateur magician and possibly the biggest Mel Tormé fan in the world. The public defender and Harry's love interest for most of the show's run was Christine Sullivan (Markie Post), who was extremely honest as well as a bit naive. The prosecutor was Dan Fielding (John Laroquette), an egoistical, sarcastic womanizer. The bailiffs for much of the show's run were Bull Shannon (Richard Moll), a dim-witted but gentle giant of a man, and Roz Russell (Marsha Warfield), whose surly exterior hid both shyness and a warm heart. \"Mac\" Robinson (Charles Robinson) was the court clerk on Night Court for most of its run. He was possibly the most conventional character on the show, possessed of a good sense of humour and genuine affection for his friends.Night Court was created by Reinhold Weege. He was a former journalist turned sitcom writer, who had served as a writer, story editor, and producer on the classic sitcom Barney Miller and a writer on its spin-off Fish. To a large degree Night Court resembled Barney Miller. Just as a large number of eccentrics and off-the-wall characters would find their way to the NYPD 12th Precinct on Barney Miller, so too would a large number of eccentrics and off-the-wall characters find their way to Harry T. Stone's court on Night Court. While many might think the whole idea of a night shift of a criminal court was created for the TV series, there actually is a night shift of the New York City Criminal Court that operates from 5 PM to 1 PM. The purpose behind having such late hours is because of the sheer number of arrests in New York City, over 100,000 each year. In having evening hours, the defendants' Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial can then be guaranteed. The offences handled in the night shifts of the New York City Criminal Court range from traffic tickets to shoplifting, although more major offences may also be covered. It must be pointed out that New York City isn't the only municipality that runs night courts. Chicago, Los Angeles, and other jurisdictions throughout the country also have night courts.It was the night shift of the New York City Criminal Court that inspired Reinhold Weege to create Night Court. In particular, it was the judges on the benches of New York City's night courts that interested him. In the 2002 E! documentary TV Tales: Night Court, Reinhold Weege said, \"There were stories in the newspaper at the time of judges with serious emotional problems who the state had a hard time getting rid of. I thought, gosh, it would be terrific if we could get a judge through the system who was a little off centre, a little wacky.\" It was then those judges who led to the creation of Harry T. Stone, who was not only the youngest judge in New York City history, but possibly one of the more eccentric.Contrary to popular belief, Night Court was not created for Harry Anderson, although he certainly made the role of Harry T. Stone his very own. Harry Anderson was a magician and comedian who made multiple appearances on Saturday Night Live. It was in 1982 that he first appeared in the recurring role of grifter Harry \"the Hat\" Gittes on Cheers. It was through one of Harry Anderson's appearances on Saturday Night Live that he came to the attention of Jeff Melman, a producer and director on Night Court. Mr. Melman thought Mr. Anderson would be perfect for the role of Judge Stone. Harry Anderson would ultimately have some impact in shaping the character of Harry T. Stone, to the point that in some ways he was playing himself.Night Court would see several cast changes in its first three seasons. The court clerk on the show was originally Lana Wagner (Karen Austin), who appeared in only the first ten episodes of the show. It had been planned that she would be a romantic interest for Harry. She was replaced as court clerk by Mac Robinson, played by Charles Robinson, who would remain with the show for the rest of its run. The public defender on Night Court would also change early in the show's run. In the pilot Gail Strickland played the role of public defender Sheila Gardiner. For the regular series she was replaced by legendary actress Paula Kelly as Liz Williams, who even received a nomination for the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the role. For reasons that are now unknown, Paula Kelly left Night Court after its first season.Initially Paula Kelly was to have been replaced by Shelly Hack as the new public defender, Christine Sullivan. As it turned out, Miss Hack did not even make it through one episode, as Reinhold Weege decided she was not right for the part and she decided she was not right for the show. The episode \"Daddy for the Defense\" was then reshot with Markie Post as Christine Sullivan. Unfortunately, Markie Post was playing Terri Michaels on The Fall Guy at the time, and as a result was not available to star on Night Court. For most of the second season, then, Ellen Foley as Billie Young was the public defender and a love interest for Harry Stone on Night Court. Ellen Foley, who had sung with such artists as Meat Loaf and Blue Oyster Cult, left Night Court to further pursue her singing career, as well as other acting roles. By this time Markie Post was free to leave The Fall Guy, and she returned to the show as public defender Christine Sullivan. She remained with the show for the rest of its run.Perhaps the most famous changes in the cast of Night Court would be the bailiffs. While Richard Moll as Bull Shannon was with the show from its beginning to the very end, the role of the other bailiffs on the show would change out of necessity. Comedy legend Selma Diamond, who had written for everything from The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet to Your Show of Shows, originally played tough, wisecracking bailiff Selma Hacker on the show. Sadly, Selma Diamond died not long after the second season of Night Court ended from lung cancer at the age of 64. She was replaced by Florence Halop as bailiff Florence Kleiner. Florence Halop's career dated back to the Golden Age of Radio. Florence Kleiner was feisty much like Selma had been, but also loved motorcycles and heavy metal. Sadly Florence Halop died at age 63 from breast cancer. She was replaced by Marsha Warfield as bailiff Roz Russell in the fourth season. She remained with the show for the rest of its run. Fortunately, following the third season Night Court would see no more changes in its cast, with Harry Anderson, John Laroquette, Markie Post, Richard Moll, Marsha Warfield, and Charles Robinson remaining with the sitcom for the rest of its run.In addition to the regular cast, there were characters who appeared before Judge Stone repeatedly. Among these were hillbillies Bob and June Wheeler, played by Brent Spiner and Annie O'Donnell who seemed to have the worst luck in the world. Yakov Korelenko (Yakov Smirnoff) was a Russian immigrant who appeared on the show from time to time. Al Craven (Terry Kiser) was a somewhat sketchy newspaper reporter for The Manhattan Gazette, constantly seeking a \"big scoop.\"While the cast would change over time, so too would the tone of Night Court. During it first season Night Court was a good deal like Barney Miller. Barney Miller was more or less grounded in reality, with the officers of the 12th Precinct having to deal with a succession of suspects and complainants who ranged from mildly eccentric to outright neurotic. For its first season Night Court was much the same way, with Harry T. Stone's court having to deal with a parade of oddballs. It was during the second season that Night Court gradually became unmoored from reality, so that its humour went from being dry and quirky to being broad and sometimes even surreal. The shift in the show's tone can be seen in the character of prosecutor Dan Fielding. During the first season Dan was very conservative and restrained, He even smoked a pipe. Over time Dan evolved into the scheming, egomaniacal womanizer now familiar to viewers of the show. By the seventh season of Night Court, the show was so far removed from reality that Wile E. Coyote could appear as a defendant on the show, charged with harassing The Road Runner in the episode \"Still Another Day in the Life.\"Of course, while Night Court would grow broader and more surreal in its humour over time, one thing that was consistent from its first season to the very end was that the show never dealt with serious issues. During the Eighties television situation comedy was still feeling the influence of such \"relevant\" sitcoms of the Seventies as All in the Family and Maude. It was the era of the \"very special episode,\" an episode in which a sitcom tackled often controversial social issues, such as drugs, racism, teen pregnancy, and so on. In intentionally avoiding any heavy issues, Night Court was further set apart from other sitcoms of the era.Night Court was set to debut in the fall of 1993, but NBC delayed the show's debut out of concerns over the show being Harry Anderson's first lead role on a TV series. It finally debuted on Wednesday, January 4 1984. Reviews for the show upon its debut were mostly positive, with Gail Williams of The Hollywood Reporter stating, \"Night Court is a consistently funny sitcom created by Reinhold Weege..\" Noel Holston in The Orlando Sentinel, wrote of that Night Court \"...just may turn out to be the most ingratiating sitcom to hit the air since Cheers.\" While some critics liked Night Court, others did not. Howard Rosenberg began his review with the line, \"Here come da judge, but not da laughs.\"Marilynn Preston of The Chicago Tribune went even further, writing that Night Court \"..is the most idiotic TV sitcom I've seen all season.\"For its first season Night Court was not a smash hit in the Nielsen ratings, although it did not do badly. It came in at no 40 for the year. For its second season NBC moved Night Court from Wednesday night to Thursday night, following Cheers. Its ratings rose to no. 20. Night Court would continue to perform well in the ratings, rising to no. 11 in its third season and no. 7 in its fourth and fifth seasons. Unfortunately, in its sixth season NBC moved Night Court back to Wednesday night. Its ratings fell to no. 21 for the year. For its final seasons the show's ratings would drop, to no. 28 in its seventh season and to no. 50 in its eighth season. Ratings rose slightly for its ninth and final season, when it was at no. 46 for the year.Unfortunately, Night Court would be denied a proper series finale. It was presumed by the producers and everyone else involved with the show that its eighth season would be its last. Harry Anderson even moved his family to Seattle, agreeing to commute to Burbank for the show's final episodes. So sure were producers that the eighth season would be the final season that they conceived a finale in which Harry and Christine marry, Dan Fielding becomes a priest, and Bull was going to move to Pennsylvania's Amish country. All of this was dashed as NBC decided there would be a ninth season of Night Court. The season finale was then drastically altered, although Harry does finally declare his love to Christine. While the renewal of Night Court in its eighth season was unexpected, so too was its cancellation in its ninth season. The producers had to hastily throw together the show's series finale, one in which Christine was elected to Congress and one in which she and Harry don't get married.That the series finale was a sore point with many of the show's fans can be borne out by the 30 Rock episode \" The One with the Cast of Night Court.\" In \"The One with the Cast of Night Court,\" Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the star of the fictional sketch comedy show TGS, brings Harry Anderson, Markie Post, and Charlie Robinson to NBC headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza to stage the wedding between Harry T. Stone and Christine Sullivan that never happened on Night Court in order to make NBC page Kenneth Purcell (Jack MacBrayer) happy. There can be no doubt that many Night Court fans were happy as well. Night Court would prove successful as a syndicated rerun on local stations after its original network run had ended. It would also have a successful afterlife on cable channels, airing on A&E, TV Land, and Encore Classic. It aired on the broadcast network Laff for many years and can currently be found on Catchy Comedy. It can currently be found on various streaming services as well.The continued popularity of Night Court would result in a sequel series, also titled Night Court, that debuted on NBC on January 17 2023. In the sequel series Abby Stone (Melissa Rauch), the daughter of Harry T. Stone, takes over her father's former position as a judge at the night shift of the Manhattan Criminal Court. John Laroquette returned as Dan Fielding, now a widower and a public defender. He was the only character from the original show to return in the sequel. Reinhold Weege having died in 2012, the new show was developed by Dan Rubin, who had previously worked on The Michael J. Fox Show and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. The sequel has received generally favourable reviews, although given Abby's mother on the show is not Christine Sullivan, some fans might not care too much for it. Night Court was a nearly unique show when it first aired. Aside from Cheers, it is the one of the few sitcoms from the Eighties that never had a \"very special episode,\" that never tried to tackle a serious social issue in a sitcom format. On Night Court, punchlines and gags reigned supreme, and it never let reality get in the way of a good joke. What made all of this work was that the show had very well-developed characters coupled with unusually good scripts. There was a reason Night Court received so many Emmy nominations. While many sitcoms from the Eighties seem extremely dated today, Night Court remains timeless."},
{"title": "Announcing the 10th Annual Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon", "date": "Tuesday, January 2, 2024", "text": "It's that time of year when I announce the Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon. This will be the 10th Annual TV Show Episode Blogathon. The previous nine blogathons were successful, so it is back for another year.  For those unfamiliar with the Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon, it is a blogathon in which bloggers write entries about their favourite episodes of their favourite classic television shows. This year it will take place March 22, 23, and 24.Here are the ground rules:1. Posts in the blogathon must be about an episode from a scripted drama. Episodes of reality shows, talk shows, game shows, and variety shows are ineligible. That having been said, posts can be on episodes from any genre of scripted dramas: animated shows, anthology shows, detective shows, police procedurals, science fiction shows, situation comedies, and so on. I also have to say that episodes can be from scripted dramas that aired at any time of day. They don't have to be from prime time alone. If one wanted to write about his or her favourite episode from his or her favourite Saturday morning cartoon or daytime soap opera, one could.2. Because this blogathon is dedicated to classic television and I think a classic is something that must have stood the test of time, episodes must be from shows that are at least 25 years old. That means one cannot write posts on episodes from shows that debuted after 1999 (nothing from The New Adventures of Old Christine, let alone Abbott Elementary). Now here I want to point out that the episode itself does not have to be 25 years old, only the show on which it aired. Law & Order (the original, not the revival) debuted in 1990 and ran until 2010, so that its final season aired after 1999. Because Law & Order is over 25 years old, however, one could still write about an episode that aired in the 2009-2010 season.3. Given my love of British television, it should come as no surprise that posts do not have to be about episodes from American shows alone. Posts can be about episodes from any show from any country as long as the show is a scripted drama and debuted over 25 years ago. If you want to write about your favourite episode of The Saint, The Little Hobo, Jaianto Robo, or Escrava Isaura, you can.4.  I am asking that there please be no duplicates. That having been said, if someone has already chosen to cover \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" from The Twilight Zone, someone else could still write about another Twilight Zone episode.5. In keeping with ground rule no. 4, I am asking that if you participated in the past years' blogathons that you write about a different episode from what you did the past years. That having been said, you could write about an episode from the same show.  If you wrote about the Star Trek episode \"Amok Time\" last year, then you could write about the Star Trek episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\" this year.6. I am not going to schedule days for individual posts. All I ask is that the posts be made on or between March 22, March 23, or March 24 2024.7. On March 22 I will set up the page for the blogathon. I ask that you link your posts to that page.

{"title": "Goodbye, 2023", "date": "Sunday, December 31, 2023", "text": "In many ways 2023 was not a good year from me. Earlier this year I had health problems ranging from my blood pressure medication ceasing to lower my blood pressure to problems with thermoregulation, probably due to what I had thought was the flu last December, but I am now convinced was COVID-19. From April into June I was then somewhat miserable. Fortunately, I  have been feeling much better since then, although there was one event this year that put me in a foul mood, not to mention every other Turner Classics Movie fan.Quite simply, in June, Warner Bros. Discovery seemed intent on gutting TCM, with massive layoffs at the channel. Among those who were laid off were people who had been with Turner Classic Movies for literally years, including Pola Changnon, general manager of TCM (who had been with the channel for 25 years), Charles Tabesh, senior vice president in charge of content and programming (who had been with TCM from the beginning), Genevieve McGillicuddy, vice president of enterprises and strategic partnerships (who organized the annual TCM Classic Film Festival), and Anne Wilson, vice president of studio production. To TCM fans it seemed as if for the first time in the channel's 29 years of existence that it was under threat. The backlash was swift, immediate, and massive. And it wasn't simply TCM fans who were outraged, but celebrities ranging from actor Ryan Reynolds to such legendary directors as Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fortunately, the outrage on the part of TCM fans would have some effect. Charlie Tabesh was restored to his post, and Genevieve McGillicuddy returned to Turner Classic Movies as well. Actor Brian Cox, a long time Turner Classic Movies fan, recently said that \"the guy who runs Warner Bros. Discovery now\" (David Zaslav, CEO of the company) doesn't understand the value of TCM, and added that he will defend it to the death. Sadly, I think Mr. Cox is right about Zaslav not understanding the value of Turner Classic Movies, so that many TCM fans, myself included, are still concerned about the future of the channel.Of course, 2023 was also a sad year insofar as the many beloved celebrities who have died this year. Sadly, among them was one who was a friend of many classic movie fans, myself included. Bobby Rivers, film critic and celebrity interviewer who had his own show on VH-1, died only a few days ago. I had first started interacting with Bobby through social media around 2012 or 2013, and I remember many wonderful discussions with him on subjects related to classic movies and classic television.  Bobby was an original participant in TCMParty, the group of fans who live tweet movies on Turner Classic Movies using that hashtag and he was friends with many TCM fans, so that he was and still is heavily mourned. Here I want to stress, Bobby wasn't the only well-known person who had taken part in TCMParty to die this year. Film historian, author, editor, and filmmaker Cari Beauchamp died earlier this month. Cari was a close friend with many of my close friends and even a mentor to some of them. Cari was both well-respected and well-loved by TCM fandom, so that her death sent shock waves through the community. Earlier in the year Newton Minow, who was Chairman of the FCC during the Kennedy administration, died at the age of 97. I never knew Mr. Minow, but he has always been one of my heroes. Like many classic movie fans, I have had the privilege of interacting with his daughter Nell Minow on various social media services over the years. The year 2023 saw the passings of several beloved stars from film and television. To list them all would take the better part of this post and I apologize for leaving some people out, but among them were: Cindy Williams, who starred in American Graffiti (1973) and played Shirley on the classic sitcom Laverne & Shirley; Lisa Loring, the original Wednesday Addams on The Addams Family; Italian sex symbol Gina Lollobrigida; Melinda Dillon of A Christmas Story (1983) fame; the legendary Raquel Welch; Stella Stevens; Richard Belzer of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit fame; legendary producer Walter Mirisch; stuntman and filmmaker Ricou Browning; B-movie producer Bert I. Gordon; legendary actor Topol; Lance Reddick, Charon in the \"John Wick\" movies and other films; legendary singer and actor Harry Belafonte; George Maharis, forever Buz Murdock on Route 66; Barry Newman, who starred in the movie Vanishing Point (1971) and the TV series Petrocelli; the legendary Glenda Jackson; Alan Arkin, who appeared in films from The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming (1966) to The In-Laws (1979); Bob Barker, host of Truth or Consequences and The Price is Right; Arleen Sorkin, legendary soap opera star who also inspired DC comics character Harley Quinn; David McCaullum, who played Ashley-Pitt  in The Great Escape (1963) and cool Russian agent Illya Kuryakin on The Man From U.N.C.L.E.; Phyllis Coates, popular pinup and the first Lois Lane on the TV series The Adventures of Superman; Mark Goddard, who starred in the shows Johnny Ringo, The Detectives, and Lost in Space; Lara Parker, forever Angelique on Dark Shadows; Richard Roundtree, best known as private eye John Shaft; Richard Moll of Night Court fame; Matthew Perry, forever Chandler Bing on Friends; television director Robert Butler; movie and TV star Marisa Pavan; legendary television producer and writer Norman Lear; legendary actor Ryan O'Neil; Andre Braugher, who appears in such films as Glory (1989) and The Tuskegee Airman (1995) and starred on the TV shows Homicide: Life in the Streets and Brooklyn Nine-Nine; and legendary comedian and folk singer Tom Smothers.The year 2023 also saw several legendary music talents pass on, including: guitarist Jeff Beck; folk singer and songwriter Gordon Lightfoot; music legend Tina Turner; Ed Ames of the Ames Brothers; legendary crooner Tony Bennett; Robbie Robertson of The Band; Gary Wright, known for his work with Spooky Tooth and his solo career; power pop legend Dwight Twilley; Denny Laine of The Moody Blues and Wings; and The Pogues' front man Shane MacGowan. Several legends in the field of comic books and cartooning also died this year, including: Joe Giella, the legendary artist known for his work at DC Comics during the Silver Age; comic book writer Steve Skeates, known for his work on Aquaman; the legendary Al Jaffee, the longest running contributor to Mad; John Romita Sr., well-known for his work on The Amazing Spider-Man; and comic book artist and writer Keith Giffen, who created Ambush Bug and co-created Rocket Raccoon and Jaime \"Blue Beetle\" Reyes.Of course, entertainment news in 2023 was dominated by both the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) going on strike at very nearly the same time. It was the first time that both writers and actors were on strike since 1960. Central to the concerns of both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA were residuals from streaming and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The writers were concerned that Hollywood might employ AI to write whole scripts. The actors were concerned that AI could be used to replicate their likenesses without any compensation. The WGA's strike began on May 2 and ended on September 27, making it the union's second longest strike, tied with the 1960 strike, after their strike in 1988. In the case of SAG-AFTRA, it was the longest strike in the union's history. As might be expected, the reactions of studio executives were unreasonable, to say the least. For example, Bob Iger, the CEO of the Walt Disney Company, claimed the actors' demands were \"not realistic.\" I hate to tell Mr. Iger, but from my standpoint as a consumer, the idea that he deserves to be paid $27 million is not realistic. I watch movies and TV shows because of the people who write them, the people who direct them, and the people who act in them, not because of who the CEO of the studio is. Indeed, I agree with John Cleese, who said on Twitter, \"I keep reading that film studios are contemplating replacing writers and actors by using Artificial Intelligence to mimic their talents. Surely it would be easier and more efficient to replace executives, since they have no talent at all.\"  It would certainly save the studios a lot of money, money that could be used to pay directors, writers, and actors.Another big news story in movie news this year is the idea that \"superhero fatigue\" has set in after over a decade of superheroes dominating the box office. The fact is that several superhero movies did fail at the box office this year, including Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, Blue Beetle, and The Marvels. That having been said, there were some successful superhero movies this year as well. Of the top five highest grossing movies of 2023, two were superhero movies, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and the animated Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. I am undecided as to whether audiences are actually tired of superheroes or if they are being choosier about which superhero movies they want to see at the theatre. Indeed, of the superhero movies released this year there are only two I would have liked to have seen at the theatre Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and Blue Beetle (which, sadly, did not do well at the box office despite being a good movie). Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is still in theatres, and so far it seems to be falling short of expectations.Of course, superheroes aren't faring well on television either. The CW, long-time home to various DC Comics superheroes, has pretty much cancelled all of their superhero shows with the exception of Superman & Lois, whose fourth season will be its last. Streaming service Max cancelled both Titans and Doom Patrol. While The CW and Max were cancelling superhero shows, Disney+ seems to have a full slate of them for next year, including Echo, Ironheart, X-Men '97, Agatha: Darkhold Diaries, Daredevil: Born Again; and Spider-Man: Freshman Year. I guess 2023 was a bad year for those of us who are DC fans, but a bit better for Marvel fans.Regardless of whether superheroes will continue to be popular, it is certain that Barbie is. Barbie was the big movie this year, raking in a whopping $636 million. I can fully understand why. Aside from being based on an iconic and still popular property, Barbie is also one of the best movies to come out this year. Among the other top grossing films of this year were The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Oppenheimer, The Little Mermaid, Avatar: The Way of Water, and John Wick: Chapter 4. Despite the phenomenal success of Barbie, at the moment it seems a sequel is unlikely. I think that may be just as well, as the film's story is pretty much wrapped up by the end of the movie. As far as television goes, this year saw The CW continued to do away with superhero properties, as the long-running The Flash ended and it was revealed that the fourth season would be the last for Superman & Lois. One of my favourite show, Reservation Dogs, ended in its run on Hulu after three seasons. Another one of my favourite shows, Doom Patrol, also ended its run. Of the new shows to debut this year, only Lawmen: Bass Reeves really grabbed me. Other than that, my favourite new shows were ones that have been on a while: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, Star Trek: Lower Decks, and Our Flag Means Death. While for others the biggest movie news of the year may have been the  WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, the phenomenal success of Barbie, or the failure of various superhero movies at the box office, for me the biggest news this year was the premier of Ninety Minutes Later at the SAFILM-San Antonio Film Festival in August. Ninety Minutes Later is a documentary on my dearest Vanessa Marquez's life, career, and tragic death. It is directed by Cyndy Fujikawa and produced by Daniel Villareal, one of Vanessa's Stand and Deliver co-stars (he played Chuco in the movie). It has since played at the OC Film Fiesta, the Pembroke Taparelli Arts Festival, the Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival, and  the Vail Film Festival. I am hoping that a distributor will pick it up. As I see it, the more people who see Ninety Minutes Later, the greater the possibility that Vanessa will finally get justice.I have no idea what 2024 will bring. I should have another book out next month. And I hope to get another book out later in the year. I am also considering creating a Substack newsletter (I am debating that). As to A Shroud of Thoughts, it will turn 20 on June 4 2024. Regardless, I hope 2024 is a better year for me and I hope it is a better year for you as well."},

{"title": "The Wonderful Bobby Rivers, TV Personality and Friend to Many TCM Fans", "date": "Thursday, December 28, 2023", "text": "This will be one of the most difficult posts for me to write. Bobby Rivers was a celebrity interviewer and film critic. He was a veejay on VH1 in the Eighties and even had his own primetime celebrity talk show on the channel, Watch Bobby Rivers. He later hosted Top 5 on the Food Network. Bobby Rivers was also a huge fan of classic movies, and one of the original members of TCMParty, the group of Turner Classic Movies fans who live tweet movies on the channel using that hashtag. He was a friend and acquaintance to many TCM fans, including myself. Bobby Rivers died on Tuesday, December 26 2023 at the age of 70. His sister Betsy Rivers told The Hollywood Reporter that he had a series of mini-strokes and a recurrence of lung cancer.Bobby Rivers was born on September 20 1953 in Los Angeles. He was the oldest of three children, with a younger sister Betsy and a younger brother Tony. His parents were both fans of classic movies, and they encouraged a love of classic movies in him. Bobby was still a teenager when he made his first appearance on television. It was on The Movie Game, a daily syndicated game show on which contestants answered questions about movie trivia with the help of two celebrities. Bobby's teammates were comedian Phyllis Diller and Hugh O'Brien (then as now best known as Wyatt Earp on The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp). Bobby was both the youngest contestant on The Movie Game and the show's first Black contestant. He won a  Kimball spinet piano.Bobby graduated from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with a degree in broadcasting. He began his career writing newscasts at radio station WRIT-FM in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He later had a morning show on Milwaukee radio station WQFM (now WLDB). Bobby moved from radio into television, becoming the film critic at ABC affiliate WISN-TV, the first Black film critic in Milwaukee. There he hosted and produced the local talk show More. He also reviewed movies for the syndicated news and entertainment show PM Magazine.Bobby moved from Milwaukee to New York City where he went to work as an entertainment reporter for WPIX. Afterwards he became a veejay for VH1. On VH1 he was given his own show, Watch Bobby Rivers, on which he interviewed such celebrities as Mel Blanc, Michael Caine, Kirk Douglas, Sally Field, Mel Gibson, Paul McCartney, Marlo Thomas, and yet others. On VH1 he also hosted Sunday Brunch with Bobby Rivers. He moved from VH1 to WNBC, where he served as an entertainment reporter and part of the cast of Weekend Today. He also hosted the short-lived syndicated game show Bedroom Buddies, on which people who were married, engaged, or living together answered questions about their lives. Bobby moved from WNBC to WNYW where he was an entertainment reporter and a host on Good Day New York. He later served as the entertainment editor on the ABC News/Lifetime weekday magazine Lifetime Live. He then hosted Top 5 on the Food Network and then served as the film critic and entertainment reporter on Whoopi Goldberg's radio show Wake Up with Whoopi. In the late Naughts he appeared as Professor Robert Haige on the In the Know segment of the Onion News Network video podcast.Bobby did a little acting beyond his appearances on the Onion New Network. He appeared in The Equalizer episode \"Making of a Martyr\" in 1985. He also appeared in the movie Identity Crisis (1989) and two episodes of The Sopranos, as well as the short subject \"Hello Korea Goodbye\" (2006).Since 2011 Bobby maintained his blog Bobby Rivers TV. He also wrote scripts for the intros and outros on Turner Classic Movies. As mentioned earlier, Bobby was one of the original participants in TCMParty, from its earliest years. His last tweet for TCMParty was on December 17 2023, only nine days before his death.Bobby Rivers was a true pioneer. At the time he was reviewing movies on WISN in Milwaukee, Black film critics were virtually unknown. For that matter,openly gay television personalities were also virtually unknown.  As the host of Watch Bobby Rivers he was one of the first African Americans to host his own show. Bobby paved the way for both Black people and members of the LGBTQ community on television. Of course, Bobby was also very good at what he did. He had an in-depth knowledge of film history and could offer insights into classic movies that others had never considered before. As an interviewer he was able to come up with questions that his subjects might never have been asked previously. Bobby was warm and friendly, and able to put his interview subjects at ease, getting them to open up to him in a way that they might not to someone else. As might be expected, Bobby supported diversity, often addressing it on his blog. He wrote multiple times about Latino representation in the entertainment industry. He argued for the need for Black faces on Turner Classic Movies in those days before they hired Professor Jacqueline Stewart. He is one of the few bloggers I know who has written about the need for more representation of Native Americans in Hollywood. Bobby grew up during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, and so he wanted to make sure the voices of all peoples were heard.Beyond being a great film critic and celebrity interviewer, Bobby was simply a wonderful person. Bobby had faced both racism and homophobia throughout his life and career. His partner died from AIDS at a point when it was still a stigma. Bobby could easily have been bitter, but he never was. Instead, Bobby was warm and friendly and funny. And he was always supportive, wishing his friends success in whatever they did. He had a real love of classic movies and it was wonderful discussing them with him. He was both intelligent and insightful, and had a way of making one see any given movie in a new light. I remember a wonderful post he wrote on his blog about Black representation in Frank Capra's classic It's a Wonderful Life (1946).Bobby was an active part of TCMParty from its earliest days, and along with my dearest Vanessa Marquez and songbird Monica Lewis, he was one of the first celebrities to take part. As a result Bobby was friends with many TCM fans, myself included. I remember discussing Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson and Theresa Harris with him, of whom both Bobby and I were huge fans. I also remember Bobby and I telling another fan about how popular Nat King Cole was. Like many of my fellow TCMParty participants, I had many wonderful discussions with Bobby. Bobby was famous. He had interviewed Paul McCartney and had cocktails with Lucille Ball in her home, but as far as Bobby was concerned, he was simply one of us, another classic movie fan. Indeed, Bobby was the perfect gentleman. He was sweet, warm, supportive, intelligent, and insightful, and he possessed an impeccable wit and a great sense of humour. I know many of my fellow TCM fans are very sad at his passing. And I know that I will miss him very, very much."},
{"title": "The Late Great Tom Smothers", "date": "Wednesday, December 27, 2023", "text": "Tom Smothers, one half (with his brother Dick Smothers) of the legendary comedy duo the Smothers Brothers, died yesterday, December 26 2023, at the age of 86. The cause was lung cancer.Tom Smothers was born on February 2 1937 in in a U.S. Army hospital on Governors Island  in New York City. His father was Major Thomas B. Smothers of the United States Army. The family moved to the Philippines in 1941 when his father was stationed there. During World War II his mother moved the family to Southern California. Sadly, his father died in a Japanese POW camp in 1945. While attending Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California, Tom Smothers was on the gymnastics team and won the state championship on the parallel bars. He attended San Jose State College, where he competed both in gymnastics and pole vaulting. Tom Smothers and his younger Dick Smothers set out to become folk singers, and played in a group called the Casual Quartet. In 1959 they left that group to form their own act. The two played at the Purple Onion in San Francisco. By 1961 the Smothers Brothers were regulars on The New Steve Allen Show. Although they had set out to become folk musicians, the banter between Tom and Dick Smothers eventually became the focal point of their act. Tom played the scatter-brained brother, something of a male Gracie Allen, while Dick played the straight man. In truth, Tom Smothers was very intelligent and was the driving force behind the act. Their first album, The Smothers Brothers at the Purple Onion, was released in 1961. It was followed by The Two Sides of the Smothers Brothers in 1962. The Smothers Brothers released nine more albums in the Sixties, that sold very well. Their biggest selling album was Curb Your Tongue, Knave! from 1964.The continued popularity of the Smothers Brothers would insure that they would be frequent guests on television. They appeared on such talk shows, comedy sketch shows, game shows, and variety shows in the Sixties as Tonight Starring Jack Paar, The Steve Allen Playhouse, The Mike Douglas Show, Hootenany, The Judy Garland Show. The Garry Moore Show, I've Got a Secret, The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show, The Hollywood Palace, The Jack Paar Program, The Jack Benny Program, Password, Hollywood Talent Scouts, Gypsy, The Andy Williams Show, The Val Doonican Show, The Eamon Andrews Show, What's My Line, Pat Boone in Hollywood, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Dee Time, Laugh-In, Celebrity Billiards, The Rosey Grier Show, 60 Minutes. The Jonathan Winters Show, Della, The Joey Bishop Show, Laugh-In, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, The Andy Williams Show, The David Frost Show, The Irv Kupcinet Show, The Dean Martin Show, and Playboy After Dark. The Smothers Brothers also guest starred on the sitcom The Danny Thomas Show and the mystery series Burke's Law. Given the popularity of the Smothers Brothers in the Sixties, it was inevitable that they would have their own television show. Their first TV series was the fantasy comedy The Smothers Brothers Show, which aired on CBS from 1965 to 1966. On the show Tom played an apprentice angel who returns to his brother Dick and is charged with helping others. Of course, Tom usually made a mess that Dick would have to straightened out. The Smothers Brothers started strong in the ratings, but soon faltered and was cancelled at the end of the 1965-1966 season. Tom Smothers blamed the failure of the series on the fact that the Smothers Brothers lacked creative control over the show and it did not play to their strengths. It was then on February 5 1967 that The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour debuted on CBS. Unlike The Smothers Brothers Show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour was a comedy and variety show. The show began as a hipper version of the typical variety show, with such musical guests as Buffalo Springfield, Cream, Donovan, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, and The Who. It was not long before The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour evolved into a show that referenced the youth counterculture and addressed political topics of importance to young people. The socially relevant humour made The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour very successful, so successful that it was the first show to challenge the top-rated Bonanza in the ratings in years. The socially relevant humour also brought the Smothers Brothers into conflict with CBS. Ultimately CBS cancelled The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour while it was still popular in 1969. The Smothers Brothers sued CBS for breach of contract and ultimately won. Following the cancellation of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, the Smothers Brothers appeared on the summer replacement series The Smothers Brothers Summer Show on ABC. In 1969 Tom Smothers played acoustic guitar on John Lennon's single \"Give Peace a Chance.\"Tom Smothers began the Seventies hosting his own syndicated show without his brother, Tom Smothers' Organic Prime Time Space Ride. Later in the decade the Smothers Brothers starred in their own short-lived variety show on NBC titled The Smothers Brothers Show. Tom Smothers guest starred on the shows Love, American Style. He provided voices for the animated specials The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas and Betty Boop for President. He was a guest on the talk shows, variety shows, and game shows The Glenn Campbell Goodtime Hour,. The Flip Wilson Show, The Dick Cavett Show, The Julie Andrews Hour, NBC Follies, The Carol Burnett Show, Cher, Dinah!, The Sonny and Cher Show,  The Merv Griffin Show, and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. At the end of the decade the Smothers Brothers guest starred in their own TV specials, The Tom and Dick Smothers Special I and The Tom and Dick Comedy Special II. Tom Smothers appeared in the movies Get to Know Your Rabbit (1972), Silver Bears (1977), A Pleasure Doing Business (1979), and There Goes the Bride (1980). In the Eighties the Smothers Brothers hosted a new, but short-lived incarnation of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour that aired on CBS. At the start of the decade they starred in the short-lived adventure comedy series Fitz and Bones (Dick Smothers was Fitz, while Tom Smothers was Bones). Tom Smothers guest starred on The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Hotel, Tales of the Unexpected, Benson, and Cinemax Comedy Experiment. He was a voice on the animated special The Great Bear Scare. He appeared on such variety shows, talk shows, and games shows as Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters, The Glenn Campbell Music Show, Saturday Night Live, The New Hollywood Squares, Dolly, Super Dave, and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. He appeared in the movies Pandemonium (1982) and Speed Zone (1989).In the Nineties Tom Smothers guest starred on the TV shows Dream On; Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist; Suddenly Susan; and Maggie. He appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Martin Short Show, and Hollywood Squares. He appeared as himself in the movie The Vegas Connection (1999). In the Naughts he guest starred as himself on the sitcom Life with Bonnie and the animated series The Simpsons, as well as on the series The Norm Show and The Wonderful World of Disney. He appeared on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. He appeared in the movie The Informant! (2009). His last appearance was this year, on CBS Sunday Morning. Ever since childhood I have thought of the Smothers Brothers as one of the funniest comedy teams of all time. And Tom Smothers was one of the best gag men in the business. The character he played was not particularly bright, and had a sibling rivalry with his brother Dick, always throwing out his catchphrase, \"Mom always liked him best.\" Of course, Dick Smothers was always the perfect straight man, the perfect foil, to his brother Tom. The two were a perfect team. Of course, in reality Tom Smothers was not only very intelligent, but a comic genius. Indeed, Tom Smothers was such an entertainer that he even brought his skill at the yo-yo into the act. As the Yo-Yo Man he would perform numerous tricks with the yo-yo. He was so good that the Smothers Brothers even released an instructional video, Yo-Yo Man.Of course, Tom Smothers was not only funny. He was also revolutionary. The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour was the first variety show to address civil rights, the Vietnam War, the counterculture, drugs, and many political topics. It broke new ground on television and paved the way for such shows as All in the Family and Maude. He fought many battles with CBS' Broadcast and Standards department in the years The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour was on the air. He was nothing if not outspoken. A truly funny man and a champion for free speech, Tom Smothers was a very remarkable human being."},

{"title": "The Bing Crosby Show: Bing Crosby's first \"Christmas\" Television Special", "date": "Sunday, December 24, 2023", "text": "Perhaps no other celebrity was associated as much with Christmas as Bing Crosby. Among his string of hits were several Christmas songs, including \"I'll Be Home for Christmas,\" \"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas,\" \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,\" and, the biggest one of them all, \"White Christmas.\" He began a long tradition of hosting Christmas themed radio programs in 1935 when he co-hosted the Christmas edition of The Kraft Music Hall with Paul Whiteman. Afterwards he would host a Christmas edition of a regularly scheduled program or a Christmas special on radio until 1962. Curiously, Bing Crosby would be a bit of a latecomer when it came to hosting Christmas-themed programs on television. His first Christmas television special would not be until 1961. Even then, The Bing Crosby Show, also known informally as The Big Crosby Christmas Show, barely touched upon the holiday.The Bing Crosby Show was recorded on November 12 1961 at the Associated-Rediffusion Television Studio 5 in Wembley, London. It was shot while Bing Crosby was making the movie The Road to Hong Kong (1962) in Britain with Bob Hope.  It was directed by Peter Croft, a British director who had directed such British TV shows as Here and Now and Rush Hour, and would go onto direct episodes of Ready, Steady, Go!; Sexton Blake, and The Black Arrow. The guests on The Bing Crosby Show were almost exclusively British. Among them are names that are still recognizable to people world-wide today. Singer Shirley Bassey was just a few years away from world-wide fame with her rendition of the theme song to the James Bond movie Goldfinger (1964). Comedian and actor Terry-Thomas had already appeared in such films as Tom Thumb (1958), I'm All Right Jack (1959), and Make Mine Mink (1960). In an uncredited role as a bobby was Ron Moody, who had already appeared in an uncredited role in Make Mine Mink and would go onto appear in such films as Summer Holiday (1963) and The Mouse on the Moon (1963), as well as TV shows from The Avengers to Gunsmoke. Bob Hope had a cameo in The Bing Crosby Show. Miles Malleson had a career going back to the Thirties, and had appeared in such films as Brewster's Millions (1935), The 39 Steps (1935), The Thief of Bagdad (1940), Dead of Night (1946), and The Brides of Dracula (1960). While he was an American citizen, he was born in Eltham, London, his family immigrating to the United States when he was about five years old.The other guests on The Bing Crosby Show may be recognizable to connoisseurs of British film and television. Dick Hills and Sid Green were British comedy writers who had written the British TV series  The Strange World of Gurney Slade and Winning Widows, and would go onto work with the comedy team of Morecambe and Wise. Miriam Karlin was a British actress who starred on the British sitcom The Rag Trade and had appeared in the film The Entertainer (1960). Dave King was an English comedian, actor , and singer who had an uncredited role in The Road to Hong Kong, and would go onto play Clifford Duckworth on the British soap opera Coronation Street. Lennie Mayme was an actor who would become a TV director, directing such shows as Vendetta, Z Cars, The Troubleshooters, and Doomwatch. Marion Ryan was a popular British singer who appeared frequently on British television. Two rather obscure British vocal groups were also on the show, The Buskers and The Happy Wanderers.The idea behind The Bing Crosby Show was that Bing Crosby was in England researching his family tree. Of course, this was primarily an excuse for appearances by British actors and singers. While there is some acknowledgement of Christmas at the start of the special, it is largely forgotten until the very end. In fact, Bing Crosby would sing only one Christmas song in the entire special. The special began with Bing Crosby performing \"Great Day!,\" \"That's Amore,\" and \"Learn to Croon.\" Afterwards it would shift to a sketch in a tea shop, where Mr. Crosby, Marion Ryan, and Dave King performed such tea-themed songs as \"Tea for Two\" and \" When I Take Sugar in My Tea.\" During the special Bing Crosby would find himself arrested for performing on the street without a licence by a policeman played by Ron Moody. There was then a courtroom sketch in which he performed Fats Waller's \"My Fate is in Your Hands.\" Later Shirley Bassey performed \"Lucky Day (This is My),\" \"I'm Shooting High,\" and 'As I Love You.\" Towards the end of the special there would be a medley of such songs as \"Make Yourself at Home\", \"Any Old Iron,\" and \"Knees Up Mother Brown.\" Bing's performance of \"Knees Up Mother Brown\" was interrupted by a cameo by Bob Hope in drag as Bing Crosby's long-lost Aunt May. The Bing Crosby Show ended with Bing singing the only Christmas song in the special, \"White Christmas.\"The Bing Crosby Show aired on the American Broadcasting Company on December 11 1961. The December 13 1961 review of the special in Variety was somewhat mixed, with the critic writing \"The first two of Bing Crosby specials for ABC-TV may have been thin and tired in theme and some of its comedy but the hour managed to present some easy-going and bright musical moments.\" Jack Gould in The New York Times on December 12 1961 gave a more negative review, writing, \"It was time last night for Bing Crosby's occasional television special on channel 7; this one was taped in England and used a number of British artists in an outing that was to prove very thin.\"The Bing Crosby Show would not air in Britain until February 27 1963, when it aired on ITV. The reason for this was an ongoing dispute between ITV and the Equity Union. The special was then delayed until after the dispute was settled. This could possibly explain why, despite airing in the United States in December, The Bing Crosby Show features only one Christmas song, the aforementioned \"White Christmas.\" They realized it wouldn't air in Britain until later.While American critics may not have been impressed by Bing Crosby's initial Christmas television special, he would continue to appear in his own Christmas specials or host the Christmas editions of regularly scheduled programs until 1977. Although it was not done on purpose, Bing Crosby's first Christmas special, The Bing Crosby Show, and his final Christmas special Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas, bookend each other rather well. Both specials were filmed in England and feature almost entirely British guests. Ron Moody appeared in both specials, playing a policeman in The Bing Crosby Show and multiple roles (including Bing Crosby's cousin Sir Percy Crosby and Charles Dickens) in Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas. Of course, at the time no one expected Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas to be Bing Crosby's last Christmas special. He died on October 13 1977 of a massive heart attack, only a little over a month since he had filmed the special.The Bing Crosby Show is currently unavailable on streaming, not even YouTube. It was released on DVD in November 2010 as part of the set Bing Crosby: The Television Specials--Volume 2--The Christmas Specials. It was also included in the Time-Life DVD set The Best of the Bing Crosby Specials in 2018. Festival Films has also released the special on DVD. Since it first aired The Bing Crosby Show has not aired regularly, although the Nostalgia Channel showed a shortened version of the special in November 1995. Portions of the special have appeared on yet other DVDs, as well as special aired on television over the years.I rather suspect many modern viewers, accustomed to the later Bing Crosby specials filled with Christmas songs, would be disappointed by The Bing Crosby Show. Regardless, it was Bing Crosby's first Christmas special of many. It would lead to his regular appearances on television during the holiday season, whether as the host of his own special or the host of a regularly scheduled show such as The Hollywood Palace."},
{"title": "A Brief History of the Artificial Christmas Tree", "date": "Saturday, December 23, 2023", "text": "Artificial Christmas trees have been around for decades. What is more, many Americans prefer using artificial Christmas trees to the real thing. A recent article by CNN stated that this year 77% of Americans who will display a Christmas tree this year will choose an artificial one rather than a real tree, according to a survey by the American Christmas Tree Association. People may continue to debate the merits of real trees over artificial ones, but one thing is certain. Artificial Christmas trees are here to stay.The earliest artificial Christmas trees were feather Christmas trees. They originated in Germany in the 1880s and 1890s. when deforestation was becoming a problem. These feather trees were made goose feathers that would be dyed green and then attached to branches made of wire. The wire branches were then attached to a dole, that would serve as the trunk of the \"tree.\" The feather Christmas tree would be brought to the United States by German immigrants. They proved popular for a time, to the point that by the 1920s feather Christmas tree could be ordered from the Sears Roebuck Catalog and were even sold at department stores. Feather Christmas tress varied in size from two inches to thirty inches high. The feather trees sold by Sears sometimes included hand-blown glass ornaments and still later lights. Today many feather Christmas trees are valuable antiques.The popularity of feather Christmas trees would fade over time, perhaps because they did not look exactly like real trees. They would become popular again in the Fifties for a time and then once more in the Eighties. Of course, it was in the Fifties that that saw the emergence of another sort of artificial tree. It is frequently claimed that a company called the Addis Brush Company introduced the \"brush tree\" in the 1930s. It appears that this is not true. According to research conducted by the Hagley Museum in Wilmington, Delaware, there never was an Addis Brush Company in the United States, and hence no patents for artificial Christmas trees were ever assigned to them. There is a company called Addis Housewares in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1870, Addis Housewares is credited with introducing the first modern toothbrush and or much of their history manufactured other brushes as well. Correspondence between the Hagley Museum and Addis Housewares indicated that the company did not make artificial Christmas trees in the 1930s. In fact, they would not make artificial trees until the 1970s and then only for a brief time. What is more, they were sold under the name of a subsidiary, not Addis.It would appear that the credit for the earliest brush Christmas trees should instead go to American Brush Company. American Brush Company would founded in 1910 in Portland, Oregon. The company manufactured  paint brushes and janitorial supplies. It was in the 1950s that American Brush Company began making brushes for something other than painting or cleaning. According to an article in The New York Times, in the late Fifties there was a rather odd fad in design whereby \"...shop designers were using millions of small multicoloured brushes, which when assembled in department store windows, looked, in his words, 'like miniature pastel waves'.\" Of course, like most fads, this eventually came to an end.It was then that American Brush Company decided to change the machines used to make these brushes to make artificial Christmas trees instead. Their original artificial Christmas trees were made of PVC and did not look much like real trees. This, combined with the late Fifties/early Sixties fad for aluminium Christmas trees, meant that American Brush Company did not sell many of their early artificial Christmas trees. A senior machinist named Si Spiegel, was sent to close the factory that made artificial Christmas trees, but instead reported back that American Brush Company could make money with the product. As a result, one of his bosses gave Si Spiegel his own division, American Tree and Wreath, which would manufacture artificial Christmas trees and wreathes. Here it must be noted that Si Spiegel is an altogether remarkable man. He was a B-17 pilot with 849th Bomb Squadron of the 490th Bomb Group during World War II. At one point he and his crew crashed in Poland, then occupied by the Soviets, and had to make a daring escape. Si Spiegel is Jewish, so he never celebrated Christmas.Regardless, he wanted to improve the artificial trees that American Brush Company was making, even bringing in real trees so that American Brush could make their trees look more realistic. Eventually he succeeded in making artificial Christmas trees that looked much more like the real thing. By the mid-Seventies they were making 800,000 trees a year. Of course, since then the artificial Christmas tree has become much more popular.Of course, the Christmas trees made of PVC were not the only artificial Christmas trees to emerge in the 1950s. It was in 1955 that Modern Coatings, Inc. received a patent for an aluminium Christmas tree.  Their trees were expensive, costing $80 in the mid-Fifties, which would be $920 now. In 1968 the toys sales manager of Aluminum Specialty Company, Tom Gannon, saw one of the aluminium trees made by Modern Coatings in a Ben Franklin Store in Chicago. Aluminum Specialty made pots, pans, and toys. They were already making aluminum Christmas ornaments. Tom Gannon then bought the tree and returned to the headquarters of Aluminum Specialty Company in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Using the Modern Coatings tree that Tom Gannon had bought, the engineers at Aluminum Specialty were able to figure out how to make an aluminum tree that was much cheaper. In fact, it would cost less that $12. Introduced at the American Toy Fair in March 1959, Aluminum Specialty's tree proved to bet a hit. By 1964 they were making about $150,00 aluminium Christmas trees. Unfortunately, the popularity of the aluminium Christmas tree would prove to be short-lived, largely because of a classic Christmas TV special. To large degree A Charlie Brown Christmas was a protest against the commercialization of Christmas, and in the special the aluminium Christmas tree was used as a symbol of that commercialization. Rather than get an aluminium tree, Charlie Brown chooses to get a rather scraggly real tree. Sales for aluminium Christmas trees dropped precipitously after A Charlie Brown Christmas had aired. The heyday of the aluminium Christmas tree was over by 1967. Once viewed as a symbol of commercialism and the epitome of bad taste, aluminium Christmas trees would come to be regarded by some with nostalgia.Since the 1950s artificial Christmas trees have continued to evolve. The first patent for a fibre-optic tree was filed in 1973 by Albert V. Sadaca and Bernard Paulfus. Despite this, fibre optic trees would not become popular until the Naughts. It was in the early 1990s that Boto Company, then the largest manufacturer of artificial Christmas trees, began making pre-lit Christmas trees, which were sold at Target stores.There are concerns about the environmental impact of Christmas trees made of PVC, and there is still debates on whether real trees are superior to artificial ones. Regardless, artificial Christmas trees have become a part of the American landscape during the holiday season, and they don't seem likely to disappear any time soon."},
{"title": "The 20th Anniversary of Love Actually (2003)", "date": "Friday, December 22, 2023", "text": "For the most part the big name classic Christmas movies emerged from Hollywood. Christmas in Connecticut (1944), It's a Wonderful Life (1946), The Bishop's Wife (1947), Miracle on 34th Street (1947), and yet others are all American. One of the major exceptions is Scrooge (1951), also known as A Christmas Carol (1951), starring Alastair Sim, which was produced by George Minter in the United Kingdom. Another exception is Love Actually (2003). Since its release it has very nearly attained classic status, if it already hasn't. Whether it can be considered a classic or not, it has become for many one of their favourite Christmas movies. It premiered on November 6 2003 in New York City, making this its 20th year.Love Actually (2003) begins six weeks before Christmas and runs through the entire holiday season. With the exception of one subplot that takes place in part in France and Portugal and another that partially takes place in the United States, the movie is set in London. Love Actually involves ten different, interconnected stories. It is often termed a romantic comedy, which is not quite accurate given it addresses not only romantic love, but friendship, love of family, and so on. Among the stories are washed up rock star Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) trying to make a comeback with a Christmas themed cover of The Troggs' \"Love is All Around (\"Christmas is All Around\")\"; the recently elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (Hugh Grant) and the mutual attraction between him and a member of his household staff, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); schoolboy Sam's (Thomas Sangster) crush on a classmate (Olive Olson) and his stepfather Daniel's (Liam Neeson) effort to help him win her heart; Mark (Andrew Lincoln) and his crush on his best friend's (Chiwetel Ejiofor) new bride (Keira Knightley); American expatriate Sarah (Laura Linney) and her brother Michael (Michael Fitzgerald), who is institutionalized with a mental disorder; and so on. Love Actually marked the first time that Richard Curtis directed a feature film. He had co-created the classic television series Blackadder with Rowan Atkinson and written the screenplays for the hit movies Four Wedding and a Funeral (1994), Notting Hill (1999), and Bridget Jones's Diary (2001). Love Actually emerged from two different ideas for films. One would have centred on the newly elected prime minister who falls in love with one of his household staff. The other focused on a British author writing at a French cottage who falls for his housekeeper. Both of these plots would become stories in Love Actually. Richard Curtis gave up on both ideas as separate films, because, as he said in a Vulture article,  \"... they are just turning out to be a shape I know.\" He then decided to write a film about love and what it means. He drew inspiration from Robert Altman, whose films often dealt with multiple stories, as well as Woody Allen for the same reason, and the films Pulp Fiction (1994) and Smoke (1995), to write a movie with multiple stories about love. Initially, Love Actually was not set during the holiday season, but Richard Curtis loved Christmas movies and so he decided that he would make it a Christmas movie. At the time he had no idea that it would become one of those Christmas movies that people watch over and over again.Originally Love Actually included fourteen different storylines. This would have made the film too long, so four of them were cut (two of which had been filmed). One short storyline involved a poster in the office of Harry (Alan Rickman) of two women in Africa. The storyline would have had the two women talking about their daughters' love lives. Another story involved Harry and Karen's (Emma Thompson) son getting into trouble at school, after which we learn the headmistress of his school is taking care of her terminally ill partner. One scene that Richard Curtis regretted cutting involved Karen addressing the death of the wife of her friend Daniel.The casting of Love Actually was fairly straightforward and involved many actors with whom Richard Curtis had worked with in film and television before. He wanted Hugh Grant as the prime minister and Emma Thompson as his sister Karen from the very beginning. Richard Curtis had worked with Hugh Grant on Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Bridget Jones's Diary. The part of Natalie was written specifically for Martin McCutcheon, and the character was even initially called \"Martine.\" Richard Curtis had two actors in mind for ageing rock star Billy Mack, but he couldn't make up his mind which one to ask. He finally asked casting director Mary Selway to find someone he would never have thought to ask, and so Bill Nighy was cast in the role. Of course, Richard Curtis had co-created Blackadder with Rowan Atkinson, who plays an annoying department store clerk in Love Actually, and the two had also worked together on everything from Mr. Bean to Four Weddings and a Funeral. Central to Love Actually is its soundtrack, which features classic songs and covers of classic songs, everything from Otis Redding's version of \"White Christmas\" to The Beach Boys' \"God Only Knows.\" All important to the movie is Billy Mack's Christmas themed cover of The Troggs' \"Love is All Around,\" retitled \"Christmas is All Around.\" \"Christmas is All Around\" serves as a leitmotif in Love Actually, popping in the movie from time to time. It was Wet Wet Wet's cover of \"Love is All Around\" that would lead to the creation of \"Christmas is All Around\" for Love Actually. Richard Curtis had written the screenplay for Four Weddings and a Funeral, in which Wet Wet Wet's version is featured prominently. For Love Actually, which he directed and wrote the screenplay for, Mr Curtis thought it would be funny to start the film by making the audience listen to essentially the same song again. Of course, since \"Love is All Around\" was changed into a Christmas song, some of the lyrics were altered. For instance, the lines \"So if you really love me/Come on and let it show\" were changed to \"So if you really love Christmas/Come on and let it snow\".As mentioned earlier, most of the film is set in London, and it made use of some well-known landmarks in the city. Among these were Trafalgar Square; Grosvenor Chapel on South Audley Street in Mayfair, Westminster; Lambeth Bridge, the Tate Modern art gallery, Selfridge's department store, Heathrow Airport, and more. The interiors of what is 10 Downing Street in Love Actually were filmed at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, where classic movies from The Third Man (1949) to Superman (1978) had been filmed. Other film locations included Marseille, France; Vidauban, France; and Aix-En-Provence, France.An unfinished version of Love Actually was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7 2003. Love Actually then premiered in New York City on November 6 2003. It went into limited release in the United States on November 7 2003 and then into wide release on November 14 2003 in the United States. It premiered in London on November 16 2003 and went into wide release in the Untied Kingdom on November 21 2023. Love Actually received mixed reviews from critics. Love Actually received a largely positive review from Roger Ebert, who gave the movie three and a half stars and noted, \"The movie's only flaw is also a virtue: It's jammed with characters, stories, warmth, and laughs, until at times Curtis seems to be working from a checklist of obligatory movie love situations and doesn't want to leave anything out.\" Writing for the BBC, Nev Pierce said of the film, \"warm, bittersweet and hilarious, this is lovely, actually. Prepare to be smitten.\" A. O. Scott in The New York Times was largely hostile to the movie, saying, \"...it is more like a record label's greatest-hits compilation or a very special sitcom clip-reel show than an actual movie.\" Peter Travers in The Rolling Stone gave Love Actually only two stars out of four. While critics were mixed about Love Actually, audiences seemed to love the film. It made $244.9 million at the box office world-wide. The movie had come to be regarded as a holiday classic as early as 2013, with Emma Green writing an article titled \"I Will Not Be Ashamed of Loving Love Actually\" for the December 10 2013 issue of The Atlantic. A CNN story from 2016 asked, \"Is Love Actually a new Christmas classic?\"The continued popularity of Love Actually would lead to a sequel of sorts in the form of a short television promotional film for Red Nose Day entitled \"Red Nose Day Actually.\" The short was written and directed by Richard Curtis, with most of the original cast returning. The short aired in the United Kingdom on March 24 2017 and in the United States on May 24 2017. For its 20th anniversary this year, Love Actually was re-released to theatres in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands,  United States, Canada, Austria, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and South Korea. This theatrical re-release also included a new 10-minute introduction. It was also re-released to home video in a 4K restoration world-wide. Love Actually has proven to have considerable longevity. For many it has become a part of their Christmas movie-watching tradition, alongside such classics as It's a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street. In the United States it can be found on multiple cable channels every December. It is also available on multiple streaming services. Love Actually will probably always have its share of detractors, but it will also probably always have its loyal fans who will watch it every holiday season."},
{"title": "The 55th Birthday of My Dearest Vanessa Marquez", "date": "Thursday, December 21, 2023", "text": "Today my dearest friend Vanessa Marquez would have turned 55. Vanessa and I were in nearly constant contact for years, through social media, phone calls, and text messages. With Vanessa I felt that I could be myself. I told her things I would never tell anyone else, and she confided in me as well. I worried about her when she was sick and she worried about me. In the end, Vanessa meant more to me than anyone else save for my father and my siblings. It is for that reason that December 21 is a bittersweet day. On the one hand, it is a day for me to celebrate as it marks the anniversary of the birth of the one person I love more than any other. On the other hand, as I cannot wish her, \"Happy birthday,\" as I once did, it serves as a reminder that Vanessa Marquez is no longer with us.Of course, Vanessa Marquez was not only my most beloved friend, she was also a talented actress. She made her film debut in the classic Stand and Deliver (1988), and it was a most impressive debut. She had a recurring role on Wiseguy, and was a regular in the first season of the sketch comedy show Culture Clash. She appeared in such movies as Twenty Bucks (1993) and Father Hood (1993), and guest starred on such shows as Seinfeld, Nurses, and Melrose Place. Aside from Ana Delgado in Stand and Deliver (1988), her most famous role may have been Nurse Wendy Goldman on ER. She appeared in 27 episodes of the hit show in its first three seasons.While Vanessa displayed a good deal of talent throughout her career, she was also something of a trailblazer with regards to Latinas in Hollywood. When Vanessa's career began in the Eighties, Latinas, particularly Chicanas like Vanessa, were rarely seen in film and on television. When they were, they were often stereotypes. As late as the Eighties and Nineties,the highly sexualized, hot-tempered Latina stereotype was still commonly seen in movies and on television shows. Starting with Ana in Stand and Deliver (1988), Vanessa Marquez broke with that stereotype in the roles she played in films and on television. As her friend Edward E. Haynes, a production designer on the TV series Culture Clash, said of her, \"In the world where there was such little representation for people of colour, she always represented the strong, educated, and centred Latina character.\" What is more, Vanessa possessed considerable talent. In a recent article in the San Antonio Current,  her Stand and Deliver (1988) co-star Daniel Villarreal said of Vanessa, \"The first time I met Vanessa during the casting of Stand and Deliver, I knew the movie couldn't be made without her,\" and \"She was a special human being. She was vulnerable but very powerful.\"Certainly Ana Delgado in Stand and Deliver (1988) was an example of the \"strong, educated, and centred Latina character\" that Vanessa Marquez would play, and her very first at that. Ana was the timid and soft-spoken, but scholarly daughter of a restaurateur  who excels at mathematics and wants to go to medical school. Despite this, her father wants her to go to work in his restaurant, just as her siblings do.  He even insists that she drop out of her classes so she can work in the restaurant. That Ana returns to her math class shows that she apparently did stand up to her father and insisted on getting an education. The character of Ana broke with previous portrayals of Latinas on screen. She was not a Mexican spitfire or chola. She was instead a quiet, intelligent student who wanted to make a better life for herself. What makes Vanessa's performance as Ana all the more impressive is that, as mentioned above, this was her very first professional acting job. She had never appeared on screen before, not even on television or in commercials. Making this all the more impressive is that Ana was the only one of Jaime Escalante's students in the movie based on an actual person. While the other students in Stand and Deliver (1988) were composites of the various students Jaime Escalante had taught through the years, Ana was based on Leticia Rodriguez, the daughter of the owner of the restaurant El Farolito. The major difference between Ana Delgado and Leticia Rodriguez is that while Ana wanted to major in medicine, Leticia Rodriguez became an electrical engineer for Honeywell Corp.Nurse Wendy Goldman on ER was another intelligent, strong Latina character that Vanessa played. While Wendy usually appeared in humorous subplots on the show, there was no doubt that she was both intelligent and competent. She corrected Dr. Lewis in the episode Luck of the Draw when the doctor tells her to give her patient 350 milligrams of dopamine, telling Dr. Lewis, \"I think you mean micrograms.\" In the episode \"House of Cards\" it is Wendy who figures out that a drug addict needs a central line, stating, \"He hasn't any veins left,\" and goes to get Dr. Lewis to perform the procedure. In addition to being very intelligent, Wendy was also compassionate, and there are several instances throughout the first three seasons in which Wendy comforts patients and shows concern for her co-workers. While Wendy does have a temper (she yelled at desk clerk Jerry more than once), like Ana in Stand and Deliver (1988) she was a far cry from the stereotypical Latinas who had appeared in movies and on television before the Eighties. While Vanessa played a nurse on ER, in the BET television movie Fire & Ice (2001) she played Wanda Hernandez, a security technician at a firm owned by Holly Aimes (Lark Voorhies) and Pam Moore (Tempestt Bledsoe). While to a degree Wanda serves as comic relief (and possibly eye candy as well) in Fire & Ice, there is no doubt that she is both intelligent and competent at her job. She is also a bit of a romantic, and along with Pam roots for the lead characters of Holly and Michael Williams (Kadeem Hardison) to get together. As recently as the Sixties and Seventies, it would have been unthinkable in a movie or TV show that a technician at a security firm would be a Latina (or that a security firm would be owned by two Black women, for that matter). Fire & Ice (2001) was certainly a mark of how far television had come with regards to diversity.Vanessa Marquez played a variety of roles on Culture Clash, some of which were intelligent Latinas. Notably in a parody of the game show Jeopardy, she played an exceptionally smart contestant. She also played a poet who recites a rather uncomfortable (at least for men) poem about castration. In the episode \"The One After the Earthquake\" of the TV show Nurses, she played Angelica, a high school senior who wants to become a nurse. Fittingly enough, her next role would be Wendy Goldman on ER. On Wiseguy she played Conseulo \"Connie Burns,\" the scholarly niece of lead character Michael Santana (Steven Bauer). Her time in the Seinfeld episode \"The Cheever Letters\" is brief, but she played the receptionist at the Cuban diplomatic mission at the United Nations, a position of some responsibility.Of course, Vanessa played other roles beyond intelligent, scholarly Latinas. Even then she gave remarkable performances and the characters were not stereotypes. In the television movie Locked Up: A Mother's Rage she played Yo-Yo, a pregnant prison inmate convicted of killing her boyfriend when in all probability it was self-defence. Vanessa was remarkable in the role, particularly given she had never been pregnant nor was she ever in jail. In Maniac Cop 3: Badge of Silence (1992) she played a pharmacy clerk. In Twenty Bucks (1993), she played one of her best roles, that of teenager Melanie. In the movie Melanie's under-aged boyfriend wants to get wine for their dinner. To this ends she flirts with two guys in an attempt to get them to buy them the wine. In each of these cases Vanessa's characters were not stereotypes, and she played all of them well. So far I have only covered Vanessa's career on film and in television. Vanessa also acted on stage, where she also played characters who defied stereotypes. She played multiple roles in Jose Rivera's play Street of the Sun, and she so impressed the playwright that he named a character for her in his play Sonnets for an Old Century. In the play August 29 Vanessa played the militant Lucy. Vanessa also appeared in such plays as Demon Wine, Women and Wallace, Anna in the Tropics, and yet others.In playing Latina characters that were not stereotypes, Vanessa Marquez would have an impact. During her lifetime Vanessa received letters from people who had gone into mathematics or the sciences because they had been inspired by the character of Ana Delgado in Stand and Deliver (1988). I have to think that there may have been individuals who became nurses all because they saw Vanessa as Wendy Goldman on ER. Her performances on television, in movies and on stage certainly inspired people. Since her death I have heard from various people who were touched by one or more of her performances. In a time when Latinas, particularly Chicanas, were rarely seen on television or in films and, when they were seen were generally stereotypes, Vanessa Marquez was playing intelligent, strong-willed, well-developed Latina characters. In this respect, she was something of a pioneer.Of course, for me Vanessa was not simply a well-known, talented, and pioneering actress, but the one person who meant more to me than anyone else. Vanessa was intelligent, warm, sweet, loving, and beautiful, and she possessed a great sense of humour. She certainly had her problems, but I could never have found a better friend than her. On this day, her birthday, then, I find myself missing her more than usual. Vanessa Marquez was very special, both as an actress and simply as a human being."},
{"title": "TCM Remembers 2023", "date": "Wednesday, December 20, 2023", "text": "Yesterday Turner Classic Movies came out with their 2023 edition of TCM Remembers. As usual, it is bittersweet to watch. On the one hand, it is wonderful to see so many honoured in an in memorial reel. On the other hand, it is a reminder of how many we have lost in the past year. One certainly cannot watch without a few tears unless one simply isn't human.For me the tears started early, once they hit Cindy Williams. She starred in the classic Laverne & Shirley and appeared in one of my favourite movies, American Graffiti (1973). I happen to know she was an absolutely wonderful person as well. We also lost many of my other favourites this year, including Alan Arkin, Richard Roundtree, David McCallum, George Maharis, Tony Bennett, Jim Brown, Norman Lear, Shirley Ann Field, Raquel Welch, Harry Belafonte, and so many others. My only objection to this year's TCM Remembers is the inclusion of Kenneth Anger. The less said about him the better. The 2023 edition of TCM Remembers is the second one to include someone I know. Author, film historian, and documentarian Cari Beauchamp was an acquaintance rather than a friend, but she was a close friend and even a mentor to many of my close friends. She was not only one of the best film historians of all time, but a remarkable human being as well. As to the first time someone I knew was included in TCM Remembers, that was 2018 when my beloved Vanessa Marquez was includedAnyway, for those who haven't seen it, here is this year's TCM Remembers."},
{"title": "The 30th Anniversary of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)", "date": "Tuesday, December 19, 2023", "text": "Years ago my friend Brian and I decided that there was only one movie that could be watched at both Halloween and Christmas. That movie was the stop-motion animation film The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993). The movie was produced and created by Tim Burton, and directed by Henry Selick. While most of the movie is set at Christmas, The Nightmare Before Christmas deals with the mythology of both movies, making it perfect viewing in both the months of October and December. It is perhaps for that reason that since its release it has become regarded as a classic. The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered on October 9 1993 at the New York Film Festival.In The Nightmare Before Christmas, each holiday has its own world that can be entered through a doorway in a tree. In the case of Halloween, that world is Halloween Town, the leader of which is Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King While the residents of Halloween Town love Jack, he is bored with doing the same thing year in and year out, and wants to try something new. It is while he is wandering through the woods that he stumbles upon the tree with the entrance to Christmas Town. Jack finds himself fascinated by Christmas Town and decides to take over the holiday of Christmas that year. Unfortunately, Jack and the citizens of Halloween Town don't quite grasp how to celebrate Christmas.The origins of The Nightmare Before Christmas go back to Tim Burton's childhood. Tim Burton was lonely as a child growing up in Burbank, California. For that reason holidays were a special time for him. As he said in an October 10 1993 Los Angeles Times article, \"Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, you’d go to Thrifty’s and buy stuff and it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn’t there before.\" It was after Tim Burton had finished the stop-motion animation short \"Vincent\" in 1982 and he was still working at Walt Disney Feature Animation that he wrote a poem entitled \"The Nightmare Before Christmas.\" The poem drew inspiration from his favourite animated Christmas television special from his childhood, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, as well as other classic Christmas TV specials, and the poem \"A Visit From St. Nicholas,\" better known as \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas.\" Tim Burton's plan at the time was to adapt the poem as television special with narration by Vincent Price. Tim Burton created storyboards for his planned television special, and with designer and sculptor Rick Heinrichs sculpted character models. Unfortunately, Disney deemed the project \"too weird\" and shelved it.Fortunately, Tim Burton's career took off in the late Eighties and early Nineties, seeing success with the films Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (1985), Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989), and Edward Scissorhands (1990). And Tim Burton never forgot about his \"Nightmare Before Christmas\" project. Tim Burton made some inquiries about \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" and learned that Disney still owned it. Fortunately, with Mr. Burton's success, the studio was now interested in the project. One major hurdle Tim Burton had to overcome was that he did have other commitments. Indeed, at that point he was working on the sequel to Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992). He was also concerned that Disney would not give him the creative freedom he wanted. A solution was found in the form of a former co-worker at Disney. Henry Selick. Mr. Selick had worked in various capacities on the films Pete's Dragon (1977), Twice Upon a Time (1983), and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). He had also directed the stop-motion and watercolour animated short \"Seepage\" (1982), as well Pilsbury commercials, MTV channel ID spots, and work on MTV's show Liquid Television. Henry Selick was signed as the director of the feature film The Nightmare Before Christmas. The screenplay for The Nightmare Before Christmas would not be created without some difficulties. Tim Burton approached author and screenwriter Michael McDowell, who had co-written the screenplay for Mr. Burton's movie Beetlejuice. Ultimately, Tim Burton and Michael McDowell would have creative differences. It was then that Tim Burton decided that The Nightmare Before Christmas should be a musical. For the lyrics and music he went to Danny Elfman, who had scored Tim Burton's movies Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, and Batman (1989). Tim Burton and Danny Elfman created a rough storyline for The Nightmare Before Christmas. Eventually Caroline Thompson, who wrote the screenplay for Tim Burton's film Edward Scissorhands, wrote the screenplay for the movie.The Nightmare Before Christmas began filming in July 1991 and ultimately took over three years to complete. The animation crew for the movie consisted of 120 animators. The crew had to construct 227 puppets for the film. The puppet for Jack Skellington himself had around 400 heads, so that nearly any emotion could be expressed. A total of 109,440 frames were taken for The Nightmare Before Christmas. In animating The Nightmare Before Christmas, a great deal was owed to stop-motion animators Ladislas Starevich, George Pal, and Ray Harryhausen. Inspiration was also taken from such illustrators as Charles Addams,  Étienne Delessert, Edward Gorey, Gahan Wilson, and yet others. For the look of Halloween Town, the filmmakers drew upon German Expressionism, namely The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). The look of Christmas Town was inspired by the work of Dr. Seuss, who wrote and illustrated the Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas!. In contrast to Halloween Town and Christmas Town, the real world was plainer and simpler.Danny Elfman provided the singing voice of Jack Skellington, but it turned out that his speaking voice was not quite up to his singing. Chris Sarandon was then cast as Jack's speaking voice. Sally, the rag doll and Jack's love interest, was voiced by Catharine O'Hara, who had worked with Tim Burton on Beetlejuice. Glenn Shadix, who had also appeared in Beetlejuice, voiced the Mayor of Halloween Town. Paul Reubens, Pee-Wee Herman himself, played Lock, one of the trick-or-treaters who is a henchman of the villain Oogie Boogie. Joe Ranft, a fellow veteran of Disney, voiced Igor, Dr. Finkelstein's assistant. As to bogeyman Oogie Boogie and mad scientist Dr. Finklestein, they were voice by singer Ken Page and William Hickey respectively. Ken Page was a veteran of Broadway and was the original Lion in The Wiz. William Hickey had a career going back to the Fifties and had appeared in such films as Prizzi's Honor (1985) and The Name of the Rose (1986). He was well-known for his raspy voice. Originally it was planned that The Nightmare Before Christmas would be released under Walt Disney Feature Animation. The studio eventually decided the movie would be too \"dark and scary for kids,\" and so it was released under Touchstone Pictures instead. It was marketed as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered on the opening day of the New York Film Festival. It went into limited release on October 13 1993 and on October 29 1993 it went into wide release.The Nightmare Before Christmas received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film a thumbs up and wrote, \"One of the many pleasures of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is that there is not a single recognizable landscape within it. Everything looks strange and haunting. Even Santa Claus would be difficult to recognize without his red-and-white uniform.\"  Todd McCarthy in Variety also gave the film a good review, noting,\"If it were a normal holiday animated film, The Nightmare Before Christmas would be an entertaining, amusing, darker-than-usual offering indicating that Disney was willing to deviate slightly from its tried-and-true family-fare formula. But the dazzling techniques employed here create a striking look that's never been seen in such a sustained form, making this a unique curio that will appeal to kids and film enthusiasts alike.\" The Nightmare Before Christmas was also nominated for the Oscar for Best Effects, Visual Effects. The Nightmare Before Christmas did modestly well at the box office, earning $50 million in the United States when it was first released. With a budget of $24 million, this meant that it made a modest profit. It has since made more money through re-releases in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2020, and 2023. Of course, it has also made money through home video. It was first released by Touchstone Home Video on VHS on September 30 1994. It was released on DVD on December 2 1997. A special edition DVD was released October 3 2000. Since then it has been released on various other home media, including 4K Blu-ray on August 22 2023 in anticipation of its thirtieth anniversary.Of course, the popularity of The Nightmare Before Christmas has meant there has been a good deal of merchandise made ever since its initial release. There have been collectable card games, video games, action figures, and other toys and games. A pop-up book was published upon the movie's release in 1993. There has since been another pop up book, calendars, a novelization, comic books, and even a cookbook. As might be expected, both Halloween and Christmas decorations inspired by The Nightmare Before Christmas have been manufactured.The Nightmare Before Christmas became a cult film not long after its initial release. It has since gone on to become regarded as a classic. In 2008 it was ranked at no. 1 on Rotten Tomatoes' \"Top 25 Best Christmas Movies\" list. In 2020 USA Today placed The Nightmare Before Christmas at no. 4 on its list of the \"25 Best Christmas Movies of All Time.\" This year Buzzfeed included it at no. 22 in their list of \"The 50 Best Christmas Movies Ever, Ranked.\" Variety also included it in its list of \"The 45 Best Christmas Movies of All Time.\" Confirming its status as a classic, The Nightmare Before Christmas was inducted into the the National Film Registry this year for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"As to why The Nightmare Before Christmas has remained so popular through the years, much of it goes back to what my friend Brian and I agreed upon years ago: it is the one movie one can watch at either Halloween or Christmas. This makes The Nightmare Before Christmas utterly unique. It is also why the film appeals to kids and film enthusiasts alike, as Todd McCarthy pointed out in his 1993 review in Variety. Indeed, I know many horror movie fans who do not particularly care for typical holiday fare, but they love The Nightmare Before Christmas.Of course, much of the appeal of The Nightmare Before Christmas goes well beyond the fact that it is both a Halloween and a Christmas movie. As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review from 1993, there \"...is not a single recognizable landscape within it.\" While one can see the influences from everyone from Charles Addams to Dr. Seuss in its production design, it looks different from any other film before or since. Another reason that The Nightmare Before Christmas is so highly regarded is its stop-motion animation. At the time of its release, most people were probably only knew stop-motion animation from the many Rankin/Bass holiday specials or Ray Harryhausen movies. While showing viewers that stop-motion animation could be used for more than television specials or visual effects in live-action movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas also introduced many innovations to stop-motion animation. Among these the three-dimensional sets that were lit the same way that live-action movies are. The film was shot much as a live-action movie would be, with the same sort of camera angles used in live-action. The camera in The Nightmare Before Christmas also moves much as it would in live-action movies. Even the puppets in The Nightmare Before Christmas were more detailed than those used in previous stop-motion projects. While The Nightmare Before Christmas owes a good deal to George Pal, Ray Harryhausen, and Rankin/Bass, the film took stop-motion animation further than anything before it. Director Henry Selick was responsible for much of the film's revolutionary stop-motion animation. A veteran of stop-motion animation, he would later direct such stop-motion animated films as James and the Giant Peach (1996) and Coraline (2009).Ultimately, what makes The Nightmare Before Christmas so beloved is that it has a compelling story with well-developed characters. If the film had been nothing more than a technical wonder, it would not have become a cult film and then a classic. The characters of Jack Skellington, Sally, Doctor Finklestein, and Oogie Boogie may well seem more real to most viewers than many characters in live-action movies. It is because of its story and its characters that The Nightmare Before Christmas has a life all its own.The Nightmare Before Christmas proved to be a popular film from its initial release. Its popularity has only grown in the years since, to the point that it would become regarded as a classic. I have no doubt that people will still be watching The Nightmare Before Christmas, on both Halloween and Christmas, for many years to come."},
{"title": "The Hershey's Kisses \"Christmas Bells\" Commercial", "date": "Monday, December 18, 2023", "text": "One of the most popular commercials of all time is only sixteen seconds in length. The Hershey's Kisses commercial \"Christmas Bells\" debuted in 1989 and has run every holiday ever since. The commercial is extremely simple. It opens with six Hershey's kisses in green wrappers, four Hershey's kisses in red wrappers, and a single Hershey's kiss in a silver wrapper. The Hershey's kisses then play \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" as if they were Christmas bells. It ends with the last Hershey Kiss in a red wrapper to play a note releasing an exhausted, \"Whew!\" \"Christmas Bells\" is the longest running commercial in the history of Hershey's, having run over 30 years now.The origins of \"Christmas Bells\" go back to Hershey's Kisses brand manager in 1989, John Dunn. At the time he was working on a marketing campaign for the product called the \"whimsy campaign\" with advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather. The stop-motion animation for the spot was provided by Colossal Pictures. \"Christmas Bells\" was directed by Carl Willat. He had provide additional opticals for the movie Return to Oz (1985) and would later provide animation for the feature film Across the Universe (2007).  Carl Willat and Gordon Clark executed the stop-motion animation for the commercial. For the most part \"Christmas Bells\" would change very little over the years. In 2012 the commercial was redone with CGI and a new recording of the audio. On November 30 2020 a new commercial was introduced that ended with a little girl removing the red Hershey's kiss to play the final note from the frame to use in baking with her father. While the original \"Christmas Bells\" had aired earlier in the month, the new commercial was met with immediate backlash on such social media services as Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit. Because of the backlash Hershey's had to announce that they would air both commercials. The original \"Christmas Bells\" has aired ever since."},
{"title": "The 40th Anniversary of A Christmas Story (1983)", "date": "Sunday, December 17, 2023", "text": "The most popular Christmas movies seem to come primarily from the Forties. It was during that decade that Christmas in Connecticut (1944), It's a Wonderful Life (1946), The Bishop's Wife (1947), It Happened on Fifth Avenue (1947), Miracle on 34th Street (1947), and yet other Christmas classics were released. An exception to this rule is A Christmas Story (1983). Released on November 18 1983 in the United States and Canada, the film received mixed reviews and performed modestly at the box office. Fortunately, A Christmas Story (1983) would be saved from obscurity by television. It began airing in 1985 on such premium channels as HBO, Showtime, and the Movie Channel. It first aired on the cable channel WTBS (now TBS) in December 1987 and was also syndicated to local stations that same month. The popularity of A Christmas Story (1983) grew through repeated screenings on television, to the point that now it is regarded as a beloved Christmas classic.For those who have never seen A Christmas Story, the movie centres on nine-year old Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley), a boy residing in the fictional small town of Hohman, Indiana in 1940. Ralphie wants nothing more for Christmas than an official Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-Shot Range Model air rifle with a compass in the stock. In addition to Ralphie trying to figure out how to get a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas, the movie is composed of other vignettes as well, including Ralphie and his friends Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R. D. Robb) constantly being tormented by the bully Scut Farkus (Zack Ward), Ralphie's Old Man (Darren McGavin) winning a \"major award\" and the conflict it creates with Ralphie's mother (Melinda Dillon), the Old Man's conflicts with the neighbours' dogs, and a few others.A Christmas Story drew inspiration from the anecdotes of Jean Shepherd, primarily in his 1966 book In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, but also in part from his 1971 book Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters and his radio show. A Christmas Story was not the first time Jean Shepherd's work had been adapted to another medium. In 1976 the TV movie The Phantom of the Open Hearth, based on In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, aired on the PBS anthology series Visions. It was set in the late 1940s/early 1950s and featured a teenaged Ralph Parker. It was followed in 1982 by The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters, which aired on the PBS anthology series American Playhouse. Even after A Christmas Story, PBS would continue to air TV movies based on Jean Shepherd's works: The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski on American Playhouse in 1985 and Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss on American Playhouse in 1988. While A Christmas Story was primarily based on In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, it would be Jean Shepherd's radio show that would lead to the film. It was in 1968 that Bob Clark was living in Miami. He was on his way to pick up a date when he heard Jean Shepherd on his car radio telling the story \"Flick's Tongue.\" It was then that he decided to adapt Jean Shepherd's stories as a movie.  \"Flick's Tongue\" would be familiar to anyone who has seen A Christmas Story, as it is the tale of how Schwartz dared Flick to stick his tongue to a flagpole. It would be years before Bob Clark could actually make a movie based on Jean Shepherd's work. It was only after the success of the critically reviled comedy Porky's (1981) that MGM agreed to go ahead with A Christmas Story. The studio gave Bob Clark $4.4 million to make the movie, a meagre sum even at that time. The screenplay was written by Jean Shepherd himself, Bob Clark, and Leigh Brown. While Jean Shepherd had written the source material for A Christmas Story and co-wrote the screenplay, he and director Bob Clark did not always get along. Jean Shepherd acted as a bit of back seat driver where Bob Clark was concerned, constantly keeping watch on the director and making suggestions. He would even make suggestions to the actors, leading Bob Clark to yell at him to stay away from the actors. Having to stay under budget and on schedule, and concerned that Jean Shepherd's interference could jeopardize both, Bob Clark eventually banned the author from the set. Regardless, Jean Shepherd narrated the film as the adult Ralph Parker. He also has a cameo in the film as a man standing in the line to see Santa Claus at Higbee's department store. To cast the all important role of Ralphie, Bob Clark auditioned 8000 boys. The role ultimately went to 12-year old Peter Billingsley. Peter Billingsley was already a veteran actor. He had appeared in many television commercials in the Seventies, including playing Messy Marvin in a series of ads for Hershey's. He had guest starred on the TV show Little House on the Prairie and appeared in the movies as Honky Tonk Freeway (1981) and Paternity (1981). For the role of the Old Man, Bob Clark initially considered Jack Nicholson, but the role ultimately went to Darren McGavin. At the time Mr. McGavin was best known for playing Mike Hammer in the Fifties series Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer and Carl Kolchak in the Seventies series Kolchak:The Night Stalker. Melinda Dillon was cast as Ralphie's mother based on her role as Jillian Guiler in Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). She later played Teresa Perrone in Absence of Malice (1981). She had been nominated for an Oscar for both movies. Of course, among the stars of A Christmas Story is the fictional city of Hohman, Indiana. Hohman is based on Jean Shepherd's hometown of Hammond, Indiana, which had a population of 70,183 in 1940. The name \"Hohman\" is taken from the name of a major street in Hammond. In addition, many of the places in Hohman are taken from actual places in Hammond. Cleveland Street, where Ralphie lives in Hohman, is the street on which Jean Shepherd grew up in Hammond. There is an actual Warren G. Harding Elementary School in Hammond. In A Christmas Story there are also references to Lake Michigan and nearby Griffith, Indiana, an actual town near Hammond. To create the fictional city of Hammond, scouts were sent to 20 different cities. Ultimately, Hohman would emerge from a combination of three different cities. The bulk of what is supposed to be Hohman in the movie is actually Cleveland, Ohio. Ralphie's house on Cleveland Street is actually on W. 11th Street in Cleveland. Downtown Hohman, where the Christmas parade in A Christmas Story takes place, is the Public Square in downtown Cleveland. As to Higbee's, it was an actual store situated on the Public Square in Cleveland. A Christmas Story utilized both the exterior and interior of Higbee's. The opening scene in which Ralphie views the Red Ryder BB gun in the store window was filmed at Higbee's, while Ralphie's visit to see Santa was filmed inside the store. Of course, here it must be pointed out that Higbee's stores were only found in northeast Ohio, while the film is set in the fictional town of Hohman, Indiana. The actual department store located in the hometown of Jean Shepherd (who wrote the stories upon which A Christmas Story) was Goldblatt's, a chain with stores in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The Higbee's stores would continue to operate until 1992, when they were bought out by Dillards and the stores, including the Higbee's store in Cleveland, were rebranded as Dillard's. While much of A Christmas Story was shot in Cleveland, other scenes were shot elsewhere. The schoolyard of Warren G. Harding Elementary, where the famous flagpole scene took place, is actually Victoria School in St. Catharines, Ontario. Two scenes were shot in Toronto, Ontario. The bridge on which the Old Man's car has a flat is the Cherry Street Bridge in Toronto, while the Chop Suey place in the movie is located on Gerrard Street East in Toronto. Other scenes shot in Toronto included Sears Street in Toronto (down which the bullies chase Ralphie, Flick, and Schwartz), 232 Queen Street W (where the Christmas tree lot was located), and 64 Sears Street (where Ralphie finally has it out with Scut Farkas), among others.One problem that the production faced is that while it was cold that winter in Ohio, there was no snow. Snow had to be shipped in from ski resorts that were often over a hundred miles away. When the weather was even too warm for that, artificial snow was made from potato flakes and for set dressing they used shredded vinyl. In yet other scenes firefighting foam was used. A Christmas Story was filmed from January 14 1983 to March 24 1983. To help with the filming of the movie, the City of Cleveland actually kept their Christmas decorations up longer than they usually would.A question that many fans of A Christmas Story had for years is, \"What year does the movie take place?\" On the commentary for the DVD, director Bob Clark stated that he and Jean Shepherd wanted the movie to be \"...amorphously late-'30s, early-'40s.\" For that reason a specific year is never mentioned. Characters from The Wizard of Oz (1939) appear both at the Christmas parade and in Higbee's, so that A Christmas Story could be set no earlier than December 1939. There is no mention of World War II, so it has to be set earlier than December 1941. A calender dated 1939 appears in the Parker family's kitchen, which would seem to make it clear the movie takes place in 1939. The sequel A Christmas Story Christmas states that the events of A Christmas Story took place in 1940. I suppose it is up to individual fans if they want to regard that as canonical or not. As mentioned earlier, A Christmas Story was released on November 18 1983. The film actually did fairly well early in its release. It ranked no. 3 at the box office for its first weekend in release, no. 1 at the box office for its second weekend in release, and no. 6 in its third weekend in release. Unfortunately, A Christmas Story ultimately proved not to have legs. By Christmas 1983 it was only still playing at around 100 theatres nationwide. In the end it earned $19.2 million at the box office. With a budge of $2.2 million, this made it a modest success. As to the critics' reaction to the movie, as mentioned at the beginning of this post, the reviews were mixed. Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave A Christmas Story a good review, noting, \"Visits to Santa Claus are more or less standard in works of this genre, but this movie has the best visit to Santa I've ever seen.\" Roger Ebert's fellow critic at The Chicago Tribune, Gene Siskel also liked A Christmas Story, writing \"A Christmas Story is a delightful motion picture that is doomed to box office failure. On their TV show At the Movies, both Siskel and Ebert gave A Christmas Story a \"thumbs up.\" Other critics weren't so receptive to the movie. Kevin Thomas in The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Don't expect much Christmas spirit to be oozing out of A Christmas Story.\" In a 1984 review in Cinema Canada, John Harkness wrote, 'A Christmas Story is no doubt meant to evoke the lovely sort of Christmas films that were so popular in the late '30s and early '40s, films like Meet Me in St. Louis and Miracle on 34th Street, but it fails to approximate any of them.\"While some critics in 1983 and 1984 were not too fond of A Christmas Story, its popularity would grow with audiences over the years. MGM/UA Home Video released A Christmas Story on VHS and BetaMax in 1984. In December 1985 it began airing on the premium channels HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel. The event that may have contributed the most to the enduring popularity of A Christmas Story may have the acquisition of the MGM library (including A Christmas Story) in 1986. In 1987 A Christmas Story made its debut on Ted Turner's SuperStation WTBS (now TBS), where it would become a holiday tradition. By 1995 the movie was aired six times between TBS and TNT. It as in 1997 that TNT began \"24 Hours of A Christmas Story,' in which the movie was shown non-stop between  8:00 PM Eastern on Christmas Eve and 8:00 PM Eastern on Christmas Day. At the same time, TBS and TNT continued to show A Christmas Story several times earlier in December. The success of A Christmas Story would lead to both sequels and adaptations to other media. The first sequel was It Runs in the Family (1984), later re-titled My Summer Story for home video and television. While It Runs in the Family was directed by Bob Clark, the only cast members from the original film are Jean Shepherd as the narrator and Tedde Moore as Ralphie's teacher Miss Shields. The film received mixed reviews and failed at the box office.In 2012 a direct-to-video sequel A Christmas Story 2 was released. Although it was billed as an \"official\"sequel to A Christmas Story, it was not based on the works of Jean Shepherd, nor did any of the original cast or crew work on the film. It received mostly negative reviews. Last year a third sequel was released on HBO Max. A Christmas Story Christmas was produced and narrated by Peter Billingsley, who played Ralphie in the original film. It was directed by animator Clay Kaytis, who had also directed the live action film The Christmas Chronicles (2018). He co-wrote the script with Nick Schenk, who had written the Clint Eastwood movie Gran Torino (2008). In addition to Peter Billingsley, A Christmas Story Christmas saw the return of several members of the original cast, including Scott Schwartz as Flick, R.D. Robb as Schwartz, and Zack Ward as Scut Farkus. Because Melinda Dillon was in failing health, Julie Haggerty played Ralph's mom. Darren McGavin as the Old Man is scene in photos and archival footage, and the film is dedicated to his memory. Reviews for A Christmas Story Christmas were largely positive.A Christmas Story has also been adapted to the stage. In 2000 Philip Grecian wrote a stage play based on the movie. In November 2012  A Christmas Story: The Musical opened on Broadway. and ran until December 30 of that year. A television version of the musical, A Christmas Story Live!, aired on Fox in 2017.A Christmas Story was only a modest success at the box office. Had it not been for home video and repeated airings on television, it might well have been forgotten. As to why the movie ultimately proved to be successful, it is because it was unlike any Christmas movie before it. The film does capture the Christmas spirit quite well. It is a movie that is largely sentimental and reassuring. At the same time, however, A Christmas Story is a bit darker than previous holiday movies. Both Ralphie and Randy are just a little bit scared of the Old Man. Ralphie, Flick, and Schwartz live in fear of Scut Barkus and his crony Grover Dill (Yano Anaya). The commercialism of the holiday (rampant even in 1940) is acknowledged, but not treated negatively as it is in everything from Miracle on 34th Street (1947) to A Charlie Brown Christmas. Ultimately, the reason for the success of A Christmas Story may be that it captures family life in the mid-20th Century at Christmas so well. Christmas as experienced by many children in the United States did not change terribly much from the 1930s to the 1980s. If A Christmas Story remains popular, it may be because it reminds many people of the Christmases they experienced in their own childhoods."},
{"title": "\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" by Brenda Lee", "date": "Saturday, December 16, 2023", "text": "This year \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" by Brenda Lee hit no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, sixty-five years after it was first released. Not only did it become Miss Lee's third no. 1 single (after \"I'm Sorry\" and \"I Want to Be Wanted), but it made her the oldest person to hit no. 1 on the Hot 100 (Brenda Lee is 78 years old). Brenda Lee also holds the record for the longest gap between no. 1 singles (63 years, one month and two weeks) and the longest gap between a song's release and it topping the Billboard Hot 100. \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" is also only the third Christmas song to ever hit no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 (for those who are wondering, \"White Christmas\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" were released well before the Hot 100 existed). \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" was written by Johnny Marks, best known for having written the second most successful Christmas song of all time, \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (it is second only to \"White Christmas\"). Beyond \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" Johnny Marks later adapted the poem \"Christmas Bells\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow as the song \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,\" a hit for Bing Crosby in 1956. He later wrote the holiday standards \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" and \"Silver and Gold\" for the classic Christmas TV special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, in which all of the songs were written by Johnny Marks.Johnny Marks chose Brenda Lee to record \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,\" although she does not know why. At the time she was only 13 years old and had not yet had any real recording success. It was first released on November 24 1958, but it did not chart. It was released again in 1959, although once more it did not chart. In the meantime, Brenda Lee's career had started to to take off. In 1959 she reached no. 4 with the song \"Sweet Nothin's.\" In 1960 she hit no. 6 with \"That All You Gotta Do,\" no. 1 with \"I'm Sorry,\" no. 1 with \"I Want to Be Wanted.\" When \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" was re-released in 1960, then, it finally became it hit. It reached no. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1965 it peaked at no. 3 on the chart. It has remained popular ever since.As mentioned above, all of the songs in the Christmas special \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" were written by Johnny Marks. This includes an instrumental version of \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.\" A version of the song also appears in the Rankin/Bass feature film Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July (1979). Brenda Lee's original version was also included in the movie Home Alone (1990). The original version has been used on several TV shows, as well as movies from Reindeer Games (2000) to Krampus (2015) to A Christmas Story Christmas (2022). Over the years several artists have covered \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,\" including the Partridge Family, Ronnie Spector & Darlene Love,  Kim Wilde and Mel Smith, Kacey Musgraves and Camila Cabello, and yet others.This year Brenda Lee filmed a music video for \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,\" in which she lip syncs to her original version of the song, just in time for the 65th anniversary of the song's release. This perhaps explains why the perennial Christmas favourite finally hit no. 1, although I have to point out it has hit no. 2 every year since 2019. For those who would like to see it, here it is."},
{"title": "The Late Great Film Historian Cari Beauchamp", "date": "Friday, December 15, 2023", "text": "Respected film historian, author, editor, and filmmaker Cari Beauchamp died yesterday, December 14 2023, at the age of 74. She was well-loved by classic film fans, and she was friends with many of them. She was a close friend of many of my close friends, and she was even a mentor to some of them. In addition to being one of the foremost movie scholars, she was always supportive of classic film buffs. Like many, I was able to interact with Cari on social media from time to time, and she was always wonderful. Cari Beauchamp was born on September 12 1949 in Berkeley, California. She attended Lincoln High School, Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California and then San Jose State University, from which she graduated with a degree in political science and American history. She worked as a private investigator for many years. In 1973 she served as president of the National Women's Caucus of California, and as a campaign manager for Janet Gray Hayes, who was elected the mayor of San Jose in 1976. From 1979 to 1982 she was the press secretary for California Governor Jerry Brown. It was in 1990 that Cari Beauchamp began writing full-time. Her first book, Hollywood on the Riviera: The Inside Story of the Cannes Film Festival, was written with Henri Béhar, and published in 1992. Her book Without Lying Down: Frances Marion and The Powerful Women of Early Hollywood was a biography of Frances Marion, who had become the highest paid screenwriter in Hollywood by 1917 and was also the fist writer to win two Academy Awards. Without Lying Down: Frances Marion and The Powerful Women of Early Hollywood would be included in The Hollywood Reporter's list of the \"100 Greatest Film Books of All Time\" published earlier this year. She would later write and produce a documentary for Turner Classic Movies based on the book and also titled Without Lying Down: Frances Marion and The Powerful Women of Early Hollywood. It was released in 2000. Among the other books written by Cari were Joseph P. Kennedy's Hollywood Years, My First Time in Hollywood: Stories from the Pioneers, Dreamers and Misfits Who Made the Movies, and From Latin America to Hollywood: Latino Film Culture in Los Angeles 1967-2017. She edited Anita Loos Rediscovered and annotated the book with Miss Loos's niece Mary Anita Loos. She also edited Adventures of a Hollywood Secretary: Her Private Letters from Inside the Studios of the 1920s by Valeria Belletti. Cari was also a contributor to multiple publications, including Vanity Fair, The Hollywood Reporter, Indiewire, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and many others.As mentioned above, Cari Beauchamp wrote and produced the documentary Without Lying Down: Frances Marion and The Powerful Women of Early Hollywood. She wrote the PBS documentary The Day My God Died (2003), which aired on Independent Lens. The documentary focused on girls in India and Nepal who were sold into sexual slavery.. It was nominated for an Emmy. She also appeared in multiple documentaries on classic movies and other subjects. She was a consultant on advisor on The Cutting Edge: The Magic of Movie Editing and Moguls & Movie Stars: A History of Hollywood, and yet other documentaries. She was also a familiar face on Turner Classic Movies. She was a special guest TCM Spotlight: Trailblazing Women in 2015 and 2016. >Cari Beauchamp served as a presenter at multiple TCM Classic Film Festivals. She was also a speaker at the British Film Institute, the Cannes Film Festival, the Edinburgh Film Festival the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. She was also a resident scholar at the Mary Pickford Foundation and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts.Before anyone else did so, Cari Beauchamp wrote about the women in the early film industry. While the focus of Without Lying Down: Frances Marion and The Powerful Women of Early Hollywood is Frances Marion, in its pages one also learns about such other influential women in the early days of Hollywood as Marie Dressler, Hedda Hopper, Lillian Gish, Anita Loos, Mary Pickford, Zasu Pitts, and others. She paved the way for other authors to write about the women who helped shape the American film industry. Of course, Cari Beauchamp often examined topics that few others had before, whether it was Joseph Kennedy's days in Hollywood or Latino film culture. Much of what made Cari Beauchamp such a great film historian and author is that she was very skilled at getting the facts. She had been a private investigator, and she put those skills to use in writing about classic movies. What is more, Cari Beauchamp's writing was never dry or boring. She wrote in an engaging style guaranteed to keep the reader hooked. Her knowledge of film history and an engaging personality also made her perfect as a speaker or presenter at film history panels. She was certainly enthusiastic about film. What is more, she was supportive of her fellow classic film buffs. With Cari Beauchamp's passing, the classic film community has lost one of its brightest lights."},

Shirley Anne Field was born Shirley Broomfield in Forrest Gate, Essex (what is now the London Borough of Newham) on June 27 1936. She was six years old when she was placed in the National Children's Home at Edgworth, near Bolton, Lancashire. She subsequently spent most of her childhood in a series of children's home. When she was 15 years old she returned to her family in London. Before her film career, Shirley Anne Field was a pinup girl who appeared in such publications as Reveille and Titbits.Shirley Anne Field was noticed by director Val Guest and made her film debut in a small role in the movie Simon and Laura in 1955.

{"title": "The Apartment (1960)", "date": "Monday, December 11, 2023", "text": "Even for a director who had a long string of critically acclaimed hits, The Apartment (1960) numbers among Billy Wilder's most successful movies. While The Apartment was controversial upon its release due to its portrayal of marital infidelity, the film has since become regarded as a classic. It was nominated for several Academy Awards, and won the awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Story and Screenplay--Written Directly for the Screen, Best Art Direction--Black and White, and Best Film Editing. It also did well at the box office, and it was the 8th highest grossing film of 1960.The Apartment centres on C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon), an employees of Consolidated Life, a major insurance company in New York City. As Baxter says in his opening narration, \"You see, I have this little problem with my apartment.\" Quite simply, he allows four Consolidated Life executives to use his apartment for their clandestine affairs. Baxter's life is complicated by the fact that he is enamoured with elevator operator, Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). Unfortunately for Baxter, Miss Kubelik is romantically involved with personnel director Jeff D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).While The Apartment is not very often counted among the great holiday films, it is very much a Christmas movie. Indeed, it takes place over the entire holiday season, with it beginning on November 1 and ending on New Year's Eve, with the bulk of the plot unfolding during the holiday season itself. Furthermore, the office Christmas party plays an important role in the plot. Important events central to the plot take place on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The movie's famous climax takes place on New Year's Eve itself. The Apartment actually takes in more of the holiday season than many other films shown at Christmastime.  The initial concept for The Apartment emerged when Billy Wilder first saw Brief Encounter (1945). In the film Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) meets with Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) in the apartment of a friend in the course of their affair (here it must be noted that they are both married). Billy Wilder was much more fascinated by the idea of the friend who let the two lovers use his apartment (and who is never actually seen in the movie) than the two people having the affair themselves. Another possible source for The Apartment was alleged affair between agent Jennings Lang and actress Joan Bennett, who at the time was married to producer Walter Wanger. Mr. Lang and Miss Bennett's met in the apartment of one of Mr. Lang's underlings. When Walter Wanger found out about this, he promptly shot Mr. Lang (for the sake of propriety, I won't say where). Walter Wanger plead insanity and served only four months in prison. Jennings Lang went on to marry songbird Monica Lewis, to whom he was married for forty years and with whom he had three sons. According to Billy Wilder's writing partner I. A. L. Diamond, another source of inspiration for The Apartment was a real life incident in which a woman committed suicide in a man's apartment after their affair had gone sour.In casting The Apartment, Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond only had one actor in mind for the role of C. C. Baxter--Jack Lemmon. After Some Like It Hot (1959), Messrs. Wilder and Diamond both wanted to work with Mr. Lemmon again, and no other actor was even considered for the role. Character actor Paul Douglas was originally cast in the role of the oily insurance company executive Mr. Sheldrake. Sadly, Paul Douglas died on September 11 1959 from a heart attack. He was only 52. Fred MacMurray was then cast as Sheldrake.Fred MacMurray was initially hesitant to take the role. Not only was he well known for having generally played nice guys over the years, but he was just beginning his long running TV sitcom My Three Sons and he had just signed a contract with Disney to star in a series of family films. Fortunately Billy Wilder was able to persuade Fred MacMurray to take the role. Mr. Wilder had previously persuaded Fred MacMurray to play against type as the none-too-nice Walter Neff (who also happened to be in the insurance industry) in Double Indemnity (1944).The role of Baxter's neighbour, Dr. Dreyfuss, would also go to an actor other than the one Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond originally had in mind. They had originally intended for character actor Lou Jacobi to play the role. At the time Mr. Jacobi may have been best known for his work on Broadway in The Diary of Anne Frank. As it turned out Lou Jacobi was already committed to another Broadway play, The Tenth Man, and its producers would not release him from his contract so he could appear in The Apartment. Jack Kruschen was then cast as Dr. Dreyfuss. Jack Kruschen was a frequent guest star on television shows in the Fifties, and he had appeared in such films as The Buccaneer (1958) and The Man Who Understood Women (1959).For her role as Fran Kubelik, Shirley MacClaine actually prepared for her role by operating an elevator in the Los Angeles Times building for a day. Because Billy Wilder did not want Shirley MacLaine to know how the movie ended, so he gave her only forty pages of the script. As a result, she thought the script wasn't finished. Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond would not allow even the slightest deviation from their script, which initially proved to be a bit of a problem for Shirley MacLaine, who was accustomed to improvising. While she initially resented Mr. Wilder's views on improvisation, she grew to appreciate him and the two would work together again on Irma La Douce (1963).The Apartment premiered on June 15 1960 in New York City and San Francisco. It opened at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on June 21 1960. The Apartment received its share of positive reviews. In The New York Times Bosley Crowther gave the film a glowing review, calling The Apartment \"...a gleeful, tender and even sentimental film.\"   Variety also gave The Apartment a positive review, opening with, \"Billy Wilder has furnished The Apartment with a one-hook plot that comes out high in comedy, wide in warmth and long in running time.\" As mentioned earlier, the film was controversial, so The Apartment did receive reviews that were less than complimentary. Hollis Alpert of The Saturday Review referred to it as \"a dirty fairy tale\" In Esquire Dwight MacDonald referred to The Apartment as possessing \"slick cynicism and prurient sentimentality.\"Regardless of what critics thought of The Apartment, audiences seemed to love the movie. It made $24.6 million at the box office. As mentioned earlier, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences also loved The Apartment. It was nominated for several Oscars and won quite a few as wellThe Apartment remains highly respected to this day. In 1994 it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" In 2012 it was ranked as the 44th greatest film of all time in a poll of  conducted by Sight and Sound magazine. It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies. In a 2017 poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC it was ranked as the 27th greatest comedy of all time.Of course, beyond being regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, The Apartment is very much a Christmas movie. Taking place through the whole of the holiday season and dealing with themes associated with the holiday, few movies are as closely tied to Christmas as The Apartment is."},

{"title": "\"In My Life\" by The Beatles", "date": "Friday, December 8, 2023", "text": "It was 43 years ago today that John Lennon was murdered. I learned the news the following morning, and I cried more over John than any other celebrity except for my dearest Vanessa Marquez. Today then seems a suitable time to post what is not only my favourite John Lennon song, but my favourite Beatles song of all time.\"In My Life\" appeared on The Beatles' album Rubber Soul, released on December 3 1965 in the United Kingdom and December 6 1965 in the United States. The song was mostly written by John Lennon, with Paul McCartney contributing either the harmony and the middle-eight (according to John Lennon) or having set John Lennon's lyrics to music (according to Paul McCartney). Regardless, the song's inspiration stems from a suggestion by English journalist Kenneth Allsop that John Lennon write a song about his childhood. The original lyrics to \"In My Life\" took the form of a bus journey that John Lennon took from his child hood home at 251 Menlove Avenue in Woolton to Liverpool, with such places as Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, the tram sheds, and so on named in the lyrics. John Lennon decided the whole thing was ridiculous, describing it as \"...the most boring sort of 'What I Did on My Holiday's Bus Trip' song...\" John Lennon then gave up writing lyrics about a bus trip and then instead focused on memories of the friends and lovers of his past. These new lyrics may have taken some inspiration from the 18th Century poem by Charles Lamb \"The Old Familiar Faces,\" the final lines of which read, \"How some they have died, and some they have left me,/And some are taken from me; all are departed--/All, are gone, the old familiar faces.\"I have loved \"In My Life\" since childhood, and, if anything, my love for it has only grown since I have gotten older. Vanessa also loved the song, and I am not sure that it wasn't her favourite Beatles song. Regardless, I cannot think of the song without thinking of her. John Lennon, who could be critical of his own work, thought highly of the song. He counted it as his \"first real major piece of work.\""},

{"title": "The Late Great Norman Lear", "date": "Wednesday, December 6, 2023", "text": "Norman Lear, the legendary television producer who developed the classic sitcom All in the Family and created the sitcoms Maude, The Jeffersons, and One Day at a Time, died yesterday at the age of 101.Norman Lear was born on July 27 1922 in New Haven Connecticut. His family later lived in Chelsea, Massachusetts, Brooklyn, New York, and Hartford, Connecticut. He attended Samuel J. Tilden High School in Brooklyn, and then Weaver High School in Harford, from which he graduated. He won a scholarship to Emerson College through a speech he had written, \"The Constitution and Me.\" He dropped out of college to enlist in the United States Army Air Forces. He flew 52 missions over Europe in a B-17 bomber.After being discharged from the service in 1946, he got a job with a Broadway publicity firm. After being fired from that job, he worked for his father, after which he moved to Los Angeles to try to find another job in publicity. It was after stumbling upon a performance of George Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara at the Circle Theatre on his first night in Los Angeles that he and his cousin Ed Simmons began writing comedy bits. They sold Danny Thomas a routine for $500, after which they became part of the writing staff for Jack Haley, who as launching a variety show on NBC. Norman Lear and Ed Simmons found work on The Colgate Comedy Hour, and later worked on The Martha Raye Show. The partnership between Norman Lear and Ed Simmons ended when Bud Yorkin asked them to work on The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show. Norman Lear accepted the offer, but Ed Simmons refused it. Afterwards Norman Lear worked on The George Gobel Show. It was in the early Sixties that Norman Lear created his first show with Roland Kibbee, the Western The Deputy. It debuted in 1961 and ran for two seasons. He worked on television specials, including The Danny Kaye Special, Henry Fonda and the Family, and The Andy Williams Special. He wrote or co-wrote the movies Come Blow Your Horn (1963), Divorce American Style (1967), and The Night They Raided Minsky's (1968).It was in the late Sixties that Norman Lear began developing an American version of the British television show Till Death Do Us Part. The original pilot, titled Justice for All, was developed for ABC and taped in 1968. ABC decided to have a second pilot filmed. The second pilot, Those Were the Days, was completed in 1969. Unfortunately, the controversy over the sketch comedy show Turn-On, which was so great that it only aired once in February 1969, made ABC nervous about airing a show whose main character was a racist. It was afterwards that CBS picked the show up and retitled it All in the Family. All in the Family was revolutionary in tackling serious subjects that had been rarely addressed on American television, and never before on a situation comedy. Over the years All in the Family tacked such subjects as antisemitism, abortion, homosexuality, rape, racism, the Vietnam War, and yet other subjects. Receiving modest ratings in its first season, it became the no. 1 show on American television in its second season.With the success of All in the Family, Norman Lear was able to develop or create several other socially relevant sitcoms, including such hits as Sanford and Son, Maude, and One Day at a Time. He also created the soap opera parody Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman and its spinoff Fernwood 2 Night. Other shows which Norman Lear either created or developed in the Seventies included The Dumplings, Hot L Baltimore, All's Fair, All That Glitters, and Sanford Arms. While the classic sitcom Good Times was created by Eric Monte and Mike Evans, Norman Lear was involved in its development. The Jeffersons was created by Don Nicholl, Michael Ross, and Bernie West, but Norman Lear was also involved in its development. He also wrote the feature film Cold Turkey (1971).In the Eighties Norman Lear created the short-lived sitcom a.k.a. Pablo with Rick Mitz. He also served as an executive producer on such shows as Palmerstown U.S.A. and Square Pegs. He was also an executive on the movie The Princess Bride (1987). In the Nineties he created the shows Sunday Dinner and 709 Hauser. He was an executive producer on the show The Powers That Be. He was also an executive producer on the movie Fried Green Tomatoes (1991). In the Naughts he was one of the writers on Chapelle's Show. In the Teens, he served as an executive producer on a reimagining of One Day at a Time with a Cuban American family. There can be no doubt that Norman Lear revolutionized American television, Prior to All in the Family, such subjects as abortion, homosexuality, politics, racism and so on might be addressed in such dramas as The Defenders or East Side/West Side, but they were never, ever addressed on situation comedies. All in the Family ushered in an era of socially relevant comedies, many of which would be developed, created, or produced by Norman Lear himself. Norman Lear's willingness to push the envelope as to the subject matter of American television sitcoms also made him very successful as a producer. At one point during the Seventies three out of the four top rated shows on American television were produced by Norman Lear. It is a mark of the impact that Norman Lear had on American television that he was one of the first seven inductees into the TV Hall of Fame in 1984, alongside such heavyweights as David Sarnoff, William S. Paley, Edward R. Murrow, Paddy Chayefsky, Lucille Ball, and Milton Berle. Few people ever had the impact on television history that Norman Lear did."},
{"title": "Godspeed Denny Laine", "date": "Tuesday, December 5, 2023", "text": "Denny Laine, founder, original lead singer, and guitarist of The Moody Blues and co-founder and guitarist for Wings, died today, December 5 2023, at the age of 79. The cause was interstitial lung disease.Denny Laine was born Brian Frederick Hines in Tyseley, Birmingham, England on October 29 1944. He took up guitar when he was still very young. He was only 12 years old when he made his first solo performance. He started his career as a professional musician as the leader of Denny Laine and The Diplomats. The name \"Denny\" was a nickname and he took the surname Laine from his sister's favourite singer, Frankie Laine. Denny Laine simply felt that his given name, Brian Frederick Hines, \"...wouldn't work.\"It was in 1964 that he left The Diplomats. It was not long afterwards that Ray Thomas and Mike Pinder formed a new band with Graeme Edge and Denny Laine. They were originally called the M & B Five after the Mitchells & Butlers Brewery in Smethwick, which is near Birmingham. It was by the end of August 1964 that they became The Moody Blues, taking inspiration from the Duke Ellington song \"Mood Indigo.\" Their first single, a cover of \"Steal Your Heart Away\" by Bobby Parker, was released in September 1964. It would be their second single, a cover of the Bessie Banks song \"Go Now,\" that would become their first major hit. It reached no. 1 on the UK singles chart and no. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Moody Blues released a self-titled EP and the album The Magnificent Moodies.Unfortunately, The Moody Blues were unable to follow up on the success of \"Go Now.\" After several singles failed to reach the UK singles chart, Denny Laine left The Moody Blues in October 1966. After leaving The Moody Blues, he formed The Electric String Band. He also released two singles as a solo artist on the Deram label, \"Say You Don't Mind\" and \"Too Much in Love.\" Both failed to chart. The Electric String Band broke up, after which Denny Laine joined Trevor Burton's supergroup Balls. That band broke up towards the end of 1969.In 1970 Denny Laine played for a time with Ginger Baker's Air Force. In 1971 he formed Wings with Paul and Linda McCartney, and was the only member to remain with the band for all ten years of its existence. Wings proved to be successful, releasing seven studio albums and 29 singles. Both their albums and their singles regularly reached the tops of the charts in both the United Kingdom and the United States. In the U.S. alone, six of their singles hit no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Even as he was part of Wings, Denny Laine released solo albums. Ahhh...Laine was released in 1973, Holly Days in 1977, and Japanese Tears in 1980. He released nine more solo albums from 1982 to 2008. He also played guitar and other instruments on many of Paul McCartney's solo albums in the Eighties.Denny Laine was certainly a talented musician, singer, and songwriter. he co-wrote many of the B-sides of The Moody Blues' early singles, as well as various songs for Wings (including the hit \"Mull of Kintyre.\"  As a singer he was capable of powerful, soulful vocals. If \"Go Now\" was a success, it may have well been because of Denny Laine's singing. He was also a bit of a pioneer. While The Electric String Band saw little success, it was one of the first rock bands to use electrified strings, pre-dating The Electric Light Orchestra by several years. Regardless, he was an integral part of The Moody Blues in their early days and an integral part of Wings throughout their career."},
{"title": "It's Trad, Dad! (1962)", "date": "Saturday, December 2, 2023", "text": "(This post is part of the Hammer-Amicus Blogathon IV, hosted by Cinematic Catharsis and Realweedgiemidget Reviews)Amicus Productions is best known for the many horror movies they made, particularly such portmanteau films as Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965), Torture Garden (1967, and From Beyond the Grave (1974). While they remain best known for their horror output, Amicus did not start out that way. In fact, the first official Amicus production was a musical featuring both jazz and rock 'n' roll artists. Not only was It's Trad, Dad! (1962) the very first official Amicus movie, but it was also the first feature film directed by Richard Lester, soon to become famous for directing The Beatles' movies A Hard Day's Night (1964) and Help! (1965).It's Trad, Dad! stars Helen Shapiro and Craig Douglas as a girl and a boy living in a small English town. They both love traditional jazz (hence the \"trad\" of the title), as do many of the young people in the town. Unfortunately, the mayor of the town dislikes traditional jazz and even removes the television set and the jukebox from the coffee shop the young people frequent. Helen and Craig then decide to organize a jazz festival in hope that this will change the mayor's mind. The two of them go to Television Centre to find a deejay to host the festival. Of course, this paper thin plot is just an excuse for musical performances by such rock 'n' roll artists as Gene Vincent, The Brooks Brothers, Del Shannon, Chubby Checker, John Leyton, and others, as well as such jazz artists as Terry Lightfoot and His New Orleans Jazz Band, The Temperance Seven, Acker Bilk and His Paramount Jazz Band, Chris Barger's Jazz Band, and others. Both Helen Shapiro and Craig Douglas get to perform some songs as well. For those unfamiliar with early to mid-Sixties British pop music, Helen Shapiro was one of the most popular female singers of the time, who had a string of hits on the UK singles chart starting in 1961. Craig Douglas was also a popular British pop singer, who had hits with covers of such American songs as \"A Teenager in Love and \"Only Sixteen\" going back to 1959. It's Trad, Dad! also featured deejays, who would have been well known to Brits, playing themselves. Pete Murray had hosted the BBC rock 'n' roll television program Six-Five Special. David Jacobs was the presenter on the BBC TV show Juke Box Jury. Alan Freeman hosted the BBC radio  show Pick of the Pops.If it seems odd that the very first Amicus production was a pop musical, it really should not. The very first movie that Amicus founders Max Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky produced together, prior to founding Amicus,  was a pop musical, Rock, Rock, Rock! from 1956. Like It's Trad, Dad!, Rock, Rock, Rock! had a paper thin plot that was primarily an excuse for musical performances, in its case by such artists as Chuck Berry, LaVern Baker, Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers, and others. And while a musical that features both jazz and rock 'n' roll might seem unusual, when one knows the history of popular music in Britain in the early Sixties, it really doesn't. A traditional jazz craze took place in the United Kingdom from 1960 to 1962, headed by such artists as Kenny Ball, Chris Barber, Acker Bilk, and The Temperance Seven. It's Trad, Dad! was conceived to take advantage of this craze by featuring several jazz artists, while at the same time including rock 'n' roll artists for good measure. As to traditional jazz, it is a form of jazz that drew upon New Orleans, Dixieland jazz. In Britain a revival of traditional jazz had begun during World War II and continued into the Sixties. Traditional jazz is often simply called \"trad jazz\" for short.Of course, as noted earlier, It's Trad, Dad!  was the first feature film directed by Richard Lester. He had already made a name for himself with the short film \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Subject. He came to the attention of Milton Subostsky through a thirty minute documentary he had directed, \"Have Jazz, Will Travel.\" As it was, It's Trad, Dad! would largely be Richard Lester's creation. According to an interview Mr. Lester did with Stephen Soderbergh in The Guardian, Milton Subotsky had written a 24 page script which he then sent to Mr. Lester. Richard Lester told  Mr. Subotsky, \"I’ve been around this kind of music all my life. I think I know how to deal with it. As soon as you get a first draft screenplay I’d be delighted to read it.\" It was then that Milton Subostky informed him that the 24 pages was the shooting script and he would start in three weeks. Richard Lester then gathered together jazz and pop artists. He used an array of moveable sets and he shot three artists a day. He also added various comic bits throughout the movie. It was filmed in three weeks at a cost of £50,000. Of course, It's Trad, Dad! is notable for an appearance by Chubby Checker, performing his song \"Lose-Your-Inhibitions-Twist.\" It was Richard Lester's idea to include Chubby Checker in the film. It was during the last week of shooting that \"The Twist\" dance craze began. Richard Lester told Milton Subotsky that it would be a great idea to get Chubby Checker in the film, stating, \"We could be the first film to have the Twist in it. He's in New York. I could go over and shoot him.\" Milton Subotsky gave his consent, but told Richard Lester that he would to pay his own way. Unfortunately for Richard Lester and Milton Subostky, It's Trad, Dad! would not be the first film to feature the Twist, as American producer Sam Katzman, \"the King of the Bs,\" beat them to the punch. Never one to pass up a fad, Sam Katzman's Twist Around the Clock (1961), starring Chubby Checker, was released on December 30 1961, three months before It's Trad, Dad! was released in the United Kingdom and nine months before it was released in the United States.While It's Trad, Dad! may not have been the first movie to feature the Twist, it was the first of its kind in many ways. Anyone familiar with Richard Lester's work would recognize the style he would later use in The Beatles' movies A Hard Day's Night (1964) and Help! (1965). For Terry Lightfoot and His New Orleans Jazz Band's performance of \"Tavern in the Town,\" Richard Lester would at times cut the screen into sections, so that the focus would be on individual musicians. The Brooks Brothers performed \"Double Trouble\" side by side with oversized photos of themselves. Acker Bilk and His Paramount Jazz Band's performance of \"Frankie & Johnny\" is intercut with humorous photos related to the plot of the song. In other sequences Richard Lester focuses on various details, such as a close-up of the neck of a guitar. Yet other sequences in It's Trad, Dad! Richard Lester utilizes sped up footage and freeze frames. Even the narrator breaks the fourth wall multiple times. It's Trad, Dad! is not only a sharp contrast to other pop musicals made before A Hard Day's Night, it is very much a forerunner of both A Hard Day's Night and Help!.Beyond seeing many of Richard Lester's directorial techniques prior to A Hard Day's Night, the main attraction in It's Trad, Dad! is the music. Indeed, many descriptions of the film fail to grasp the sheer variety of music in the film, summing it up as a musical that features Dixieland jazz and rock 'n' roll. Certainly many of the jazz bands in It's Trad, Dad! draw upon Dixieland jazz for inspiration, to the point that Bob Wallis and His Storyville Jazzmen even dress like riverboat gamblers, but then there is also The Temperance Seven, whose speciality was 1920s jazz (one of the songs they perform is the song \"Everybody Loves My Baby\" from 1924). It's Trad, Dad! also features a wide variety of rock 'n' roll performers, from Gary U.S. Bonds to the girl group the Paris Sisters to R&B singer Gene McDaniels. It's Trad, Dad! premiered in London on March 30 1962 in the United Kingdom. It also did moderately well at the box office. Made for only  £50,000, it earned £300,000 at the British box office. It was released in the United States in September 1962 under the tile Ring-A-Ding Rhythm!. One could assume its distributor, Columbia Pictures, thought Americans would not know what \"trad\" was. On both sides of the Pond It's Trad, Dad! received largely positive reviews, to the point that Richard Lester would later say, \"I’ve had the best reviews out of It’s Trad, Dad! that I’ve ever gotten.\"Amicus would follow It's Trad, Dad! with another musical, Just for Fun, whose paper thin plot was also an excuse for musical performances. Their third film would be in the genre for which they are best known, Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965). Today It's Trad, Dad! is largely forgotten, although there is every reason it should be better remembered. It was not only Richard Lester's first feature film, but it also features techniques that he would later use in A Hard Day's Night, The Knack...and How to Get It (1965), and Help! (1965). It also features some superb performances from such diverse artists as Del Shannon, Acker Bilk and His Paramount Jazz Band, John Leyton, Chris Barber's Jazz Band, and yet others. Of course, it was also the first official film from Amicus Productions, and, given its success, it was a rather auspicious first film at that."},
{"title": "The Devil Rides Out (1968)", "date": "Friday, December 1, 2023", "text": "(This post is part of the Hammer-Amicus Blogathon IV, hosted by Cinematic Catharsis and Realweedgiemidget Reviews)When Boomers, Gen Xers, and even Millennials think of Sir Christopher Lee, his first role that is likely to come to mind is that of Dracula in the many Hammer horrors in which he played the character. For Zoomers the first role that comes to mind may be Saruman in the Lord of the Rings films or Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Sir Christopher Lee played many villains in his long career and he was very good at playing villains, so much so that it is sometimes hard to believe he ever played a hero. One notable film in which he did play the hero was The Devil Rides Out (1968), originally released as The Devil's Bride in the United States. The Devil Rides Out (1968) stars Sir Christopher Lee as adventurer and occultist the Duc de Richleau. The Duc de Richleau's protege Simon Aron (Patrick Mower) had broken off contact with him. It is for that reason that the duke and Simon's father, Rex Van Ryn (Leon Greene, dubbed by Patrick Allen), visit Simon at a manor house he recently purchased. There they find Simon in the company of others, and getting ready for some event to be held that evening. An investigation of the manor house's observatory reveals a pentagram and various strange markings, and it becomes obvious that Simon has become involved with Satanists. The Duc de Richleau then finds himself in conflict with a Satanic cult, led by Mocata (Charles Gray).The Devil Rides Out  was based on the 1934 novel of the same name by Dennis Wheatley. It was the second novel by Mr. Wheatley to feature the Duc de Richleau, the first being The Forbidden Territory, published in 1933. In all, the Duc de Richleau would appear in eleven novels by Dennis Wheatley, with the last novel, Gateway to Hell, being published in 1970. As to the Duc de Richleau himself, he was an aristocrat who engaged in a variety of adventures. The Duc de Richleau novels range in genre from adventure (The Forbidden Territory) to mystery (Three Inquisitive People) to the occult (The Devil Rides Out and Gateway to Hell). The Devil Rides Out would not be the first Duc de Richleau novel to be adapted as a a film. The Forbidden Territory was adapted by none other than Alfred Hitchcock in 1934, although the character of the Duc de Richleau was replaced by an Englishman named Sir Charles Farringdon (Ronald Squire). Sales for Dennis Wheatley's books remained strong throughout the years, and in the Sixties they sold in the millions.It would be Christopher Lee himself who led Hammer Film Productions to adapt The Devil Rides Out as a movie. Christopher Lee was a huge fan of Dennis Wheatley's work, and had even met the author at one of his lectures in the mid-Fifties. He then persuaded Hammer to adapt Dennis Wheatley's novels. It was then in 1963 that Hammer optioned The Devil Rides Out, as well as some of Dennis Wheatley's other novels on the occult. Hammer ultimately decided against adapting The Devil Rides Out at the time, as they felt that because The Devil Rides Out dealt with Satanism it might not receive a certificate from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).Fortunately, as the Sixties passed concerns about censorship over devil worship in movies abated, so Hammer Film Productions felt secure enough to adapt the novel The Devil Rides Out. The original script for The Devil Rides Out was written by John Hunter, who co-wrote the Hammer adventure film Pirates of Blood River (1962) with John Gilling. Hammer was unhappy with John Hunter's adaptation, so they hired legendary science fiction, fantasy, and horror writer Richard Matheson to write a new script. Even in 1967 Hammer Film Productions had concerns over any possible censorship, so they submitted the script for The Devil Rides Out to the BBFC. The BBFC made it plain that they did not want to see \"...any misuses of Christian emblems or any parodies of Christian prayers.\" Hammer was then very careful as to what was shown on screen in The Devil Rides Out.Christopher Lee was set to play the Duc de Richleau from the very beginning. For the all important role of the villain Mocata, Hammer had originally wanted Gert Fröbe, best known for playing Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond movie Goldfinger (1964). The role would ultimately go to an actor who would later play another villain in a James Bond movie. Charles Gray would go onto play Blofeld in Diamonds Are Forever (1971). Still later he would play the Criminologist in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). The Duc de Richleau's friend Rex Van Ryn was played by Leon Greene, who had appeared in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966). His voice would be dubbed by Patrick Allen (more on that in a bit).The Devil Rides Out was directed by perhaps the director most associated with Hammer Film Productions, Terence Fisher. He directed the film that turned Hammer into the premier studio for horror movies, The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), as well as Dracula (1958--AKA Horror of Dracula), The Mummy (1959), and yet other Hammer horrors. Special effects on The Devil Rides Out were provided by Michael Stainer-Hitchens, a situation which was not of Hammer's choosing. Michael Staivers-Hutchins co-owned the rights to the novel The Devil Rides Out, and demanded that he provide the special effects in return for his rights to the book. As it turned out, some of the bigger special effects in The Devil Rides Out would be completed by an uncredited Les Bowie,  who had provided effects for such Hammer films as The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), Dracula (1958), The Kiss of the Vampire (1963), and yet others. He would later be part of the special effects team on the movie Superman (1978).The Devil Rides Out completed shooting in the summer of 1967, but its path to the big screen would not be smooth. It was producer Anthony Nelson Keys, who also served as producer on such Hammer films as The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Dracula (1958), who decided that Leon Greene's voice would have to be redubbed. Leon Greene's voice was then dubbed by Patrick Allen, who had appeared in the Hammer swashbuckler Captain Clegg (1962) and narrated the Hammer adventure film The Viking Queen (1962). He would also provide the voice-over for the British trailer for The Devil Rides Out. In the United States, the American distributor for The Devil Ride's Out, 20th Century Fox, cut several seconds of some of the film's more controversial scenes. They also retitled it The Devil's Bride for its American release, as they feared The Devil Rides Out made it sound like a Western.The Devil Rides Out was released in the United Kingdom on July 7 1968 as the lead feature in a double bill with Slave Girls (1967), as the Hammer film Prehistoric Women had been retitled for its British release. It was released on December 18 1968 in the United States. While The Devil Rides Out has gone on to become a favourite with Hammer Film fans, it did poorly at the box office on both sides of the Pond. In the United Kingdom, much of the reason for its poor performance at the box office may have been because it was paired with Prehistoric Women.  Not only did Prehistoric Women  belong to a completely different genre (fantasy adventure), but Hammer counted it among their worst motion pictures ever made and actually delayed its release in the United Kingdom for two years. It had been released in the United States on January 24 1967. In the United States, The Devil's Bride (as it was titled in the States) may have simply been the victim of bad timing. Rosemary's Baby (1968), which also dealt with devil worship, had been released on June 19 1968. Witchfinder General (1968), produced by Hammer rival Trigon British Film Productions, was released under the title The Conqueror Worm, in the United States on August 14 1968. Even though The Devil Rides Out had originally been conceived in 1963 and filmed around the same time as Rosemary's Baby and shortly before Witchfinder General (which was filmed in autumn 1967), it was then beat to American cinemas by two other movies that dealt with Satanism. For Americans, then The Devil's Bride may have felt like an afterthought.Fortunately, The Devil Rides Out would find new life on television and still later on home media. No less than Sir Christopher Lee himself named The Devil Rides Out as one of his favourite films and he said that he would like to have seen it remade with modern special effects with him playing a more mature Duc de Richleau. Over the years it has developed a cult following and has become a favourite among the Hammer horror movies. In many ways it was a pioneer in its genre. Conceived in 1963 and released the same year as Rosemary's Baby and Witchfinder General, it was among the first in a new occult horror cycle that would last into the Seventies."},

Indeed, in AFI's 1999 list 100 Years..100 Stars, Cary Grant ranked second to only Humphrey Bogart as the greatest male star. He had a long career, from working in vaudeville in the 1920s to his final screen credit, Walk, Don't Run, in 1966. Over the years he appeared in a number of legendary movies, including Bring Up Baby (1938), Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), North by Northwest (1959), and Charade (1963). Even today people who have never seen a classic movie in their lives recognize his name.It should be no surprise that Cary Grant is Turner Classic Movies' Star of the Month for December 2023. Every Friday night TCM will be showing several of his movies. What is more, on December 22 2023, Cary Grant and Dyan Cannon's daughter Jennifer Grant will co-host a night of Mr. Grant's movies with TCM host Dave Karger.

{"title": "Redbone", "date": "Tuesday, November 28, 2023", "text": "While the height of their career was in the Seventies, Redbone remains the best known band of entirely Native American and Mexican American descent. Redbone would have a major hit with \"Come and Get Your Love,\" which went to no. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Earlier their single \"Witch Queen of New Orleans\" had reached no. 21 on the chart. Redbone was known for recording songs about Native American topics when it was unusual for music artists do do so. Their stage costumes and album covers also often reflected their Native American heritage.Redbone was formed in 1969 by Lolly and Pat Vegas. The name \"Redbone\" was chosen as it is a Cajun for someone of mixed racial ancestry. This reflected the Vegas brothers' heritage, as they were of Mexican American, Yaqui, and Shoshone descent. They took music while they were still very young. It was in 1961 that Pat Vegas released the single \"I Wanna Be a Movie Star.\" The following year he released the single \"The Best Girl in the World.\" Neither single charted.It was in 1963 that Lolly and Pat Vegas formed The Avantis. The Avantis served as a support band for The Beach Boys, and also recorded a few singles the Chancellor, Regency, and Astra labels. Their single \"Wax 'Em Down\" proved to be a minor hit, reaching no. 21 on the Canadian single chart. Eventually Lolly and Pat Vegas began performing as The Vegas Brothers or Pat & Lolly Vegas. It was in 1969 that they formed Redbone. Pat Vegas has said that he was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, who is said to have been part Cherokee, to form an all Native American band. Aside from the Vegas brothers, the band consisted of Peter DeBoe, the drummer of  Southern Cheyenne, Turtle Mountain Chippewa, and Rogue River/Siletz descent and Tony Bellamy, the guitarist of Yaquei and Mexican American descent. Redbone was signed to Epic Records in 1969. Redbone's self-titled debut album was also a double album was released in January 1970. It was followed in October 1970 by their album Potlatch. It was with Potlatch that Redbone really began to explore topics related to Native Americans. Even the term \"potlatch\"is of Indigenous origin,  referring to a gift-giving feast practices by Indigenous peoples in the Pacific Northwest. The song \"Alcatraz\" addresses the island that had been occupied for more than 19 months by Native American activists beginning in November 1969. Potlatch would also see Redbone's first real success. The album reached no. 99 on the Billboard album chart, while the single from the album, \"Maggie,\" peaked at no. 45 on the Billboard Hot 100. Redbone would see even more success with their third album, Message from a Drum. The album produced their hit single \"Witch Queen of New Orleans\" and it reached no. 75 on the Billboard album chart. Their fourth album, Already Here, did not do nearly as well. Redbone recovered with their fifth album, Wovoka, which proved to be their highest charting album. It also produced their hit \"Come and Get Your Love.\" The album itself peaked at no. 66 on the Billboard album chart. Its title is taken from the lead song on the album, \"Wovoka,\" the Paiute religious leader who played an important role in the history of the Ghost Dance. In the United Kingdom Wovoka also featured \"We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee,\" an openly political song that addressed the Wounded Knee massacre of 1890 and the Wounded Knee Occupation of 1973. In the United States the song was initially. withheld for release as it was viewed as too controversial. Sadly, Wovoka and \"Come and Get Your Love\" would see the height of Redbone's chart success. Their next album, Bearded Dreams Through Turquoise Eyes only reached no. 174 on the Billboard album chart, while their album Cycles did not chart at all. \"Come and Get Your Love\" would be their last major hit single. Redbone would continue through the years, with several membership changes. They released their final album, One World, in 2005. It was re-released as Peace Pipe in 2009. Lolly Vegas died in 2010 at the age of 70 from lung cancer. Pat Vegas continued with a touring version of Redbone to this day.Redbone are an important part of rock history. They were among the first bands composed entirely of members of indigenous descent. Furthermore, they addressed Native American topics. They would pave the way for further Native American artists. Their songs would also be covered by artists from Bobby Gentry to Tom Jones. While Redbone's chart success would only last for a few years, their influence on rock music remains to this day."},
{"title": "Christmas Movies on TCM in December 2023", "date": "Monday, November 27, 2023", "text": "Shirley MacLaone and JackLemmon in The ApartmentFor many of us Turner Classic Movies is the destination for Christmas movies, not the Hallmark Channel. There is a good reason for this, as every December TCM shows some of the greatest Christmas movies ever made. This year is no different, as they are showing such classics as The Apartment (1960), The Bishop's Wife (1947), Christmas in Connecticut (1944), It Happened on 5th Avenue (1947), The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942), and yet others. Every year I compile a schedule of my picks for movies guaranteed to bring the Christmas spirit to those who celebrate the holiday. This year is no different. This TCM is showing Christmas movies every Saturday and Sunday until December 17 when they begin their marathon of non-stop holiday films that last until December 25. Some of you may notice Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) is not included in the schedule. Now Meet Me in St. Louis is one of my all-time favourite movies. If not for The Wizard of Oz (1939), it would be my favourite Judy Garland movie. As much as I love Meet Me in St. Louis, I have never, ever thought of it as a Christmas movie. In fact, my favourite times to watch are in the spring and the fall! For those of you who do think of it as a Christmas movie, I will tell you that Meet Me in St. Louis is airing on TCM at 11:00 PM on Saturday; December 16; at 7:00 PM on Thursday; and December 21; at 5:00 PM on Sunday, December 24.  Anyway, without further ado, here is the schedule of my picks for Christmas movies to watch on Turner Classic Movies in December 2023.

{"title": "Tension (1949)", "date": "Saturday, November 25, 2023", "text": "Assumed identities are a relatively common trope in film noir. It plays a role in movies from The Stranger (1946) to No Man of Her Own (1950). Perhaps only a few other film noirs took the idea of assumed identities as far as Tension (1949). It is at the core of the movie, and we even get to see the protagonist go about creating his new identity.In Tension (1949) Warren Quimby (Richard Basehart) is the meek, mild-mannered night manager of the Coast-to-Coast Drug Store in Culver City, California. He lives in a modest apartment above the drug store, saving money until he can afford a house in the suburbs. Unfortunately, his wife Claire (Audrey Totter) does not want to wait that long. Neither the apartment above the drug store nor a house in the suburbs appeal to her, as she longs for greater things. To this end she cheats on him with any man willing to spend money on her. At long last she leaves him for one of her rich suitors, Barney Deager (Lloyd Gough). This does not sit well with Warren, who creates a whole new identity with the goal of murdering Deager. He gets contact lenses, buys fancy clothes, and moves into an apartment in Westwood, Los Angeles. His new identity is Paul Sothern, a cosmetics salesman. Warren backs out of his plan to kill Deager after meeting his lovely new neighbour Mary Chanier (Cyd Charisse). Unfortunately for Warren, Deager winds up dead anyway...Tension was based on a story by John D. Klorer, who had earlier provided the stories for such films as Seven Miles from Alcatraz (1942) and Good Sam (1948). MGM initially bought the rights to the story as a vehicle for Robert Taylor and Van Heflin. As it turned out, the protagonist Warren Quimby would be played by Richard Basehart, while Barry Sullivan would play Lt. Collier Bonnbel, the police detective who suspects Warren of murder. Tension was directed by John Berry, who had earlier directed the comedy Cross My Heart (1946) for Paramount and the musical Casbah (1948) for Marston Productions (Tony Martin's production company, which had a distribution deal with Universal). Unfortunately, in 1951 he was named a Communist by director Edward Dmytryk, one of the Hollywood Ten. He was blacklisted and relocated to the United Kingdom.The contact lenses that figure so prominently in Warren Quimby's transformation into Paul Sothern were a bit of a timely topic in 1949. Contacts lenses that fit over the sclera of the eye had existed since the 1800s. By the 1940s contact lenses made from plastic were developed. It was in 1949 that the first contact lenses that fit over the cornea of the eye were developed. They were smaller and could be worn up to 16 hours a day. Unfortunately, they tended to be both fragile and expensive. It would not be until the 1960s that soft contact lenses would be developed. Of course, one of the more far fetched ideas Warren Quimby had about creating a new identity is that contact lenses would make him less recognizable. As anyone who has switched from glasses to contacts knows, one is still recognizable wearing contact lenses. When I first started wearing contacts, I got the questions, \"Where are your glasses?\" and \"Did you get contacts?,\" but I was never asked, \"Who are you?.\" I can only guess that Warren decided if doing away with one's glasses worked for Clark Kent, maybe it would work for him...Tension premiered on December 1 1949 in Memphis, Tennessee. For the most past it got positive reviews. The critic for Variety wrote that Tension \"lived up to its title. It's a tight, tersely stated melodrama that holds the attention.\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times was an exception in that he disliked the move. In his overly negative review, he wrote, \"A much better title for this picture would be \"Patience,\" presuming such a thing.\" Audiences were not apparently impressed by Tension either. Made for $682,000, it only made $506,000 in the United States and Canada. It lost  $229,000 at the box office. Fortunately, the reputation of Tension would improve in the years since its release, to the point that it is counted among the better film noirs MGM ever made. While the idea that someone could create a new identity with merely contact lenses and new suits is a bit far fetched, the script by Allen Rivkin and the performances of the cast make Tension convincing. Richard Basehart does a good job of transitioning from the meek, mild-mannered Warren Quimby to the outgoing Paul Sothern. And the role of Claire numbers among the best of Audrey Totter's \"bad girls.\" She is selfish and greedy, and she constantly demeans Warren, to the point that one wonders why he would even want to remain with Claire. As Mary, Cyd Charisse is certainly among the sexiest good girls in film noir, but she is not mere window dressing. She endows Mary with a personality all her own, warm and sweet, but at the same time very much her own woman. Barry Sullivan also does well as the dogged detective Bonnabel, who gives the film its title in his monologue prior to the opening credits. Tension (1949) may not be as well known as such film noirs as Double Indemnity (1944) or The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), but it is a well done movie that benefits from some great performances and a script that consistently builds, well, tension. It should really be better known."},
{"title": "Will Sampson Defied Stereotypes", "date": "Friday, November 24, 2023", "text": "Will Sampson remains best remembered for playing \"Chief\" Bromden in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). He also appeared in such films as Buffalo Bill and the Indians (1976) and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976). Sadly, his career as an actor would be short one. He died in 1987 at the age of 53, having suffered from scleroderma in his later years. While Will Sampson's career was short, he made an impact as a Native American actor in refusing to play stereotypes and speaking out against them.Will Sampson was born on September 27 1933 in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma. He was a citizen of the Muscogee Nation. Before he was an actor, he competed in rodeos for around 20 years. In fact, he was on the rodeo circuit when the producers of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas, took notice of him. They wanted a huge American Indian to play the role of \"Chief\" Bromden. At 6' 7\" Will Sampson certainly fit the bill.Chief Bromden would be Will Sampson's first role as an actor, and from the beginning he was resisting Hollywood's tendency to portray Native American characters as stereotypes. According to a June 6 1976 article in The New York Times,  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest director Miloš Forman had wanted  Mr. Sampson to portray Chief Bromden as a stereotypical, \"ugh-Tonto Indian.\" Will Sampson objected, pointing out that the movie was set in 1963, Chief Bromden had been a football athlete in high school, and had served in the Korean War. Chief Bromden would have perfect diction. In the end, Mr. Forman appreciated Will Sampson, telling him, \"You were the only actor I didn't have to direct.\"During production of The White Buffalo (1977), in which Will Sampson played Crazy Horse, Will Samspson found out the producers had hired white actors to play the majority of Native American roles. Will Sampson then shut down production on the film for a day by refusing to act alongside the white actors playing American Indians. His experience on The White Buffalo would lead Will Sampson to become one of the founders of the American Indian Registry for Performing Arts and to serve on its Board of Directors for years. The American Indian Registry for Performing Arts was founded to advocate for Native American actors, and published a directory of Native Americans in the entertainment industry. Will Sampson was still speaking out for Native American actors and Native Americans in general only a few years before his death. In an article from the June 8 1984 issue of The Rapid City Journal, he made he point that American Indian stereotypes could still be seen in movies and TV shows, stating, \"It's a slow process. Those stereotypes started way back when. The cowboy and Indian movies are what got the (motion picture) industry going, and that wasn't too long after the Indian wars.\"In addition to being a groundbreaking actor, Will Sampson was also a talented painter. His artwork can be found in the Creek Council House Museum in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, and has been shown in such venues as the Pierson Gallery, the Gilcrease Museum, and the Philbrook Museum of Art.In demanding not to play stereotypes and speaking out against such stereotypes, Will Sampson challenged Hollywood to do better by American Indians. In playing characters with dignity, such as William Halsey in Buffalo Bill and the Indians and Crazy Horse in The White Buffalo, he changed the sorts of roles Native Americans were expected to play. While a good deal of progress still has to be made, the portrayal of Native Americans on film and the opportunities Native American actors now have might not exist if it had not been for Will Sampson."},
{"title": "Happy Thanksgiving 2023", "date": "Thursday, November 23, 2023", "text": "Chances are good that if you have paid attention to the news the past many years, you probably know that many Native Americans do not care for the holiday of Thanksgiving. And as someone who is part Cherokee, in some ways I am ambivalent about Thanksgiving myself.  If one knows American history, this should come as no surprise. The Wampanoag, who legend has it dined with the Pilgrims, suffered greatly for their contact with the British colonists. It is for that reason that many Native Americans view Thanksgiving as a celebration of the genocide of Native Americans at the hands of European settlers and observe it as a day of mourning. As I see it, the problem is that the mythology of Thanksgiving has traditionally been tied to that of Thanksgiving celebrated by the Pilgrims in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Indeed, contrary to popular belief, the Thanksgiving celebrated by the Pilgrims was not even the first Thanksgiving celebrated in North America. Among British colonists, a Thanksgiving was celebrated at Berkeley Hundred in Virginia two years before the Pilgrims celebrated their Thanksgiving. And before that, in 1541, Spanish explorer Francisco Vasquez de Coronado and his men observed a Thanksgiving. Of course, before Europeans ever arrived on North American soil, many indigenous peoples had their own Thanksgivings. For example, the Seneca have Thanksgiving rituals that last four days, and other Iroquois nations have their own Thanksgiving rituals as well. For me then, the answer is not to do away with the holiday of Thanksgiving, but to divorce it from the imagery of the Pilgrims. We should stop celebrating the Pilgrims, who ultimately brought grief to the Wampanoag. Ultimately, my point of view on the holiday is best expressed by Wilma Mankiller, the first woman to serve as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, who said of the holiday, \"We celebrate Thanksgiving along with the rest of America, maybe in different ways and for different reasons. Despite everything that's happened to us since we fed the Pilgrims, we still have our language, our culture, our distinct social system. Even in a nuclear age, we still have a tribal people.\" I think it is important to set aside a day to express gratitude. We just have to make sure that we are not celebrating genocide when we do so.Anyway, I know most of you probably want to see the various vintage pinups I post every holiday, so without further ado, here they are. First up is Leila Hyams and a friend.And here is Joan Leslie taking her turkey for a walk.And here Peggy Diggins is cuddling a turkey. Fay Webb apparently prefers eating turkey to making pets out of them.As does Frank Sinatra.And it wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Ann Miller!Happy Thanksgiving!"},
{"title": "It's Too Soon for Christmas", "date": "Wednesday, November 22, 2023", "text": "Today is the day before Thanksgiving, but one would not know it from the retail industry or the media. It was in mid to late October that local retail stores started moving Halloween merchandise out to make room for Christmas goods. The Hallmark Channel has been showing Christmas movies since October. The first Christmas-themed commercials started airing before Halloween had even passed and only increased as we got deeper into November. Indeed, it was about two weeks ago that I noticed Disney+ already has an entire section dedicated to Christmas movies. This is a sharp contrast to when I was growing up or even when I was a young man. Stores would not start stocking their shelves with Christmas goods until well into November, usually after Thanksgiving. Christmas-themed commercials would not start airing until Thanksgiving at the earliest. As for Christmas movies, one usually wouldn't see them on television until December 1 at the earliest. When I was growing up, we did not start decorating for Christmas until December was already a few days old. Now I realize everyone has their own timetables with regard to Christmas. I know people who put up their Christmas decorations the day after Thanksgiving. I even know people who are willing to watch Christmas movies in November, although they are often also the sort who will watch Christmas movies any time of year. That having been said, it seems to me that the people who want to celebrate Christmas early are in the minority. As I said, I know people who will put up their Christmas decorations the day after Thanksgiving, although most people I know will wait until December 1 at the earliest. I have a number of friends who complain about Hallmark showing Christmas movies as early as October, particularly my fellow fans of The Golden Girls and Murder, She Wrote. And most people I know complain about Christmas-themed commercials airing even before Halloween is over. Indeed, in 2012 Target made the mistake of airing a Christmas-themed commercial featuring their dog mascot Bullseye starting October 11. The outcry was so swift and immediate that Target pledged to never show a Christmas-themed commercial that early again.As it is, I think there are some very good reasons for the retail industry and the media to hold off on Christmas until after Thanksgiving. Indeed, Thanksgiving is one of those reasons. For the past thirty years, it has seemed as if Thanksgiving was in danger of becoming a mere subset of the Christmas season instead of its own holiday. To me, this would be a tremendous loss. Okay, I have to admit that I do not appreciate the traditional link between the Pilgrims and Thanksgiving, something which causes many Native Americans, particularly those in the Northeast, some degree of pain.  Even so, I think it is important to have a day set aside when we express our gratitude. It is something I don't think people do enough throughout the year. Another reason is that Christmas is a winter holiday. Indeed, Christmastide does not end with December 25. It begins on the evening of December 24 and runs until January 5. It is why the imagery of Christmas is all tied to winter. Snow, snowmen, icicles, Santa's sleigh, all of these images bring to mind the Yuletide. Even now, on November 22, let alone earlier in the month or before October, winter is some way off. Even today the weather here in Missouri is hardly Christmasy. While it is hardly warm, it is not exactly cold either. Snow is pretty much improbable. Quite simply, it is still autumn. Of course, this brings me to another thing. As far as I am concerned, we really don't need Christmas in November, let alone October. In October we have Halloween to cheer people up. In November we have Thanksgiving to make people merry. As Christmas is currently celebrated in the United States, it seems to me as if many stop celebrating it after December 25. It also seems to me that when we really need Christmas is after December 25. After all, at least here the weather is relatively mild before December 25. It is in those last days of December and first days of January that the weather turns colder and snow becomes a distinct possibility, this at the same time that the days are short and the nights are long. If ever we need a bright, cheery holiday, it is those early days of winter, not the last days of autumn. I would imagine this is particularly true of those who suffer from winter seasonal affective disorder. If we would simply return to the traditional twelve days of Christmas, I think many would be much happier.There could also be an economic reason for the retail industry and the media to hold off on Christmas until after Thanksgiving. In the CNN article, \"Holiday Creep Has Gotten Out of Hand,\" David Katz, the chief marketing officer at Randa Apparel & Accessories (who make Levi's and various other brands), noted, \"If I am going to have a four-month holiday season, I'm not as driven to buy now. You lose the sense of urgency and immediacy.\" I agree with Mr. Katz. Why should anyone buy anything for Christmas as early as October, when they know that they are going to have until December. I don't think any amount of Christmas music or Christmas imagery will make people buy for the holiday early. Indeed, I know many people who will actually avoid stores for much of November for fear of being exposed to Christmas before they are ready.Now I know there are those people who like to start celebrating Christmas early. As I said, there are those who enjoy watching Christmas movies in November. And I have nothing against that. While there are Christmas early birds, it does seem to me that retail stores could still hold off on putting out their Christmas goods until after Halloween. It also seems to me that the streaming services could already have Christmas movies available without an entire section dedicated to them, at least not until after Thanksgiving. I am not going to say individuals can't start celebrating Christmas early, but at the same time I think the retail industry and media are giving little consideration to we traditionalists who want to wait until it is at least December.Now I happen to love Christmas. Come December 1 I will have my Christmas decorations up. I will also start watching Christmas movies and listening to Christmas music. And it is because I love Christmas that I really don't want to start it early. Everything has its own season. I want to celebrate Halloween, the Day of the Dead, and Thanksgiving before I get to Christmas."},
{"title": "Rosebud Yellow Robe", "date": "Monday, November 20, 2023", "text": "Rosebud Yellow Robe was a half Lakota Sioux educator, writer, and folklorist who spent a good portion of the 20th Century educating children about Native American folklore through her books, storytelling, and even performances. She appeared on both radio and television. She was also linked to two classic movies.Rosebud Yellow Robe was born on February 26 1907 in Rapid City, South Dakota. Her father was Chauncey Yellow Robe, who was also a lecturer, educator and Native American activist. Her mother was Lillian Belle Sprenger, who had been a volunteer nurse at the Rapid City Indian School. She was of Swiss German descent. Rosebud Yellow Robe was named for the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Rosebud's father taught her and her sisters the traditions of the Lakota. She and her sisters attended the public schools in Rapid City rather than the Indian School, which tended to focus more on vocational training. Rosebud Yellow Robe graduated from the  University of South Dakota in Vermillion, South Dakota, one of the first Native Americans to do so. It was on August 4 1927 that President Calvin Coolidge was adopted into the Sioux tribe to recognize his support of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 in a ceremony that was presided over by Chauncey Yellow Robe and his daughter Rosebud. The event received a good deal of press coverage, with much of the media attention concentrated on Rosebud herself. She actually received offers from theatrical and film agents. Cecil B. DeMille tried to convince her to take the lead role in his film Ramona, but she refused. The part was ultimately played by Mexican actress Dolores Del Rio. While Rosebud Yellow Robe accepted no theatrical or movie roles, President Coolidge's visit did spark in her an interest in the theatre. When she was 22 she moved to New York City. There she created a dance routine which included authentic Native American costume, which she performed at hotels and theatres. She would go on to start educating people about Native American culture and folklore. Among the many venues in which Rosebud Yellow Robe had presentations was the American Museum of Natural History.As part of her effort to educate people about Native Americans, Rosebud Yellow Robe also worked as the Director of the Indian Village at Jones Beach State Park in Long Island, New York. Every summer from 1930 to 1950 she taught children and others about Native Americans. In the 1930s she also worked at CBS Broadcast Centre in New York City. Orson Welles was working at CBS at the same time. Many have theorized that Orson Welles named the famous sled in Citizen Kane (1941) for Rosebud.While it is not certain whether or not the sled Rosebud was named for Rosebud Yellow Robe, she did have a strong link to another classic film. In 1950 Twentieth Century Fox hired Rosebud to promote their new movie Broken Arrow, which centred upon Tom Jeffords and Cochise. On the publicity tour for Broken Arrow (1950), Rosebud criticized the portrayal of American Indians in the movies and on radio, and she also debunked the myth of the \"Indian princess.\" If she had an opinion on white actors playing American Indians in the film ( Cochise is portrayed by Jeff Chandler), she never said anything.  It was also during the 1950s that Rosebud appeared on various NBC children's programs.Rosebud Yellow Robe also wrote two children's books on Native Americans. An Album of the American Indian, published in 1969, looked the day to day life of seven different tribes prior to the arrival of Europeans. Her second book, Tonweya and the Eagles, and other Lakota Indian Tales, published in 1979, adapted folk tales told to her as a child by her father.  Rosebud Yellow Robe is an important figure in the history of Native Americans. At a time when stereotypes of American Indians were rampant in movies, on the radio, in comic books, and later on television, she sought to educate people on the reality of Native Americans. What is more, she took her campaign to educate the general public about American Indians to multiple media. She lectured on the stage. She appeared on radio and on television. And, of course, she educated thousands of children in her twenty years at the Indian Village. If Hollywood eventually began portraying the indigenous peoples of North America more accurately, it was probably due in a large part to Rosebud Yellow Robe."},
{"title": "Vanessa Marquez on DVD", "date": "Friday, November 17, 2023", "text": "Vanessa Marquez was both my dearest friend and an actress I admired. Her career in film and television was not very long. It only lasted from 1988 to 2001, but in that time she appeared in a number of movies and television shows, some of which were very high profile. Much of Vanessa Marquez's filmography is not currently available on streaming, but fortunately most of it can be found on DVD. Here then are a list of her movies and TV shows that are available on physical media.Stand and Deliver (1988): In Stand and Deliver, Vanessa played Ana Delgado, an exceptional student who wants to go to medical school, over the objections of her father who wants her to work in the family restaurant. Stand and Deliver was critically acclaimed on its release. It also earned Edward James Olmos a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. It won the Independent Spirt Awards for Best Feature, Best Director for Ramón Menéndez, Best Male Lead for Edward James Olmos, Best Supporting Male for Lou Diamond Phillips, Best Screenplay for Ramón Menéndez and Tony Musca, and Best Supporting Female for Rosanna DeSoto. It also won the Michael Landon Award for the young cast of the film at the Young Artist Awards and Best Film at the Nosotros Golden Eagle Awards. In 2011 it was selected for inclusion in the National Film Registry. Stand and Deliver was released on DVD on November 10, 1998 by Warner Home Video and has been in print ever since. It is also available on DVD with fellow teacher movie Lean on Me (1989).Wiseguy: Wiseguy was a television series that aired from September 16 1987 to December 8 1990 on CBS. Vanessa was set to have a recurring role on the show in its fourth and final season, playing Consuelo \"Connie\" Burns, the niece of the show's lead character, Michael Santana (Steven Bauer). She really enjoyed working on the show, and even got to meet Billy Dee Williams (as most of you know Vanessas was a huge Star Wars fan). Unfortunately, CBS cancelled Wiseguy before Vanessa's two episodes could air and the network never did run them. Fortunately, Vanessa's two episodes, \"Point of No Return\" and \"Changing Houses,\" would be part of the syndication package. They would also be released on DVD.Mill Creek Entertainment released season 4 of Wiseguy on DVD on September 9 2009. They later released Wiseguy: The Collector's Edition which included 67 episodes of the show, including Vanessa's episodes. It was last year that Visual Entertainment released Wiseguy - the Complete Collection, which includes all 75 episodes of the show.Sweet 15 (1990): Sweet 15 is a made-for-TV movie that aired on the PBS series WonderWorks on January 15 1990. It starred Vanessa's fellow cast member Karla Montana as Marta de la Cruz, a 14 year old who desperately wants to a have a quinceanera upon her 15th birthday. Vanessa played Marta's friend Lupe in the TV movie. Sweet 15 was released on DVD on December 21 2004 (which, coincidentally, was Vanessa's 36th birthday). It appears to be out of print, but inexpensive copies can be found on Amazon, eBay, and other sites. Locked Up: A Mother's Rage (1991): Locked Up: A Mother's Rage is a TV movie that aired on CBS on October 29 1991. It starred Cheryl Ladd as a single mother falsely imprisoned on charges of drug trafficking. Vanessa played Yolanda, nicknamed Yo-You, a young Dominican American pregnant woman who was charged with killing her boyfriend (although it appears to have been in self defence). Locked Up: A Mother's Rage is not a particularly good movie. The two leads (Cheryl Ladd and Jean Smart) tend to be overwrought, and the script  is rather poor. Even so,  it does feature one of Vanessa's best performances. It also features fine performances by Angela Bassett and Kimberly Scott. Locked Up: A Mother's Rage was released on DVD on October 30 2006 by Infinity Media. Strangely enough, they changed the title to The Other Side of Love, which has absolutely nothing to do with the movie's plot. It appears to no longer be in print, but used copies can be found on Amazon, eBay, and other sites.Seinfeld: Vanessa Marquez guest starred on the Seinfeld episode \"The Cheever Letters,\" which aired on NBC on October 28 1992. Following the destruction of his Cuban cigars in a fire, Kramer (Michael Richards) goes to the Cuban Permanent Mission at the United Nations to see if he can get some more Cuban cigars. Vanessa played the receptionist at the Cuban Permanent Mission. While Vanessa isn't on screen for very long, she does make a very strong impression.\"The Cheever Letters\" was the 8th episode of the 4th season of Seinfeld. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the 4th season on DVD on November 22  2005. The Complete Series of Seinfeld was released on November 6 2007. The Seinfeld DVDs are all still in print and can be found almost anywhere at an affordable price.Maniac Cop III: Badge of Silence (1992): While the first two Maniac Cop movies could be considered classics of the genre, Maniac Cop III: Badge of Silence is simply a bad movie. Maniac Cop (1988) and Maniac Cop 2 (1990) centred on Matt Cordell, a police officer who comes back from the dead to clear his name after being falsely imprisoned and then murdered. Maniac Cop III: Badge of Silence again features Matt Cordell, the maniac cop of the title, whose motivations for killing people this time around are not at all clear. In the movie Vanessa plays a young pharmacy clerk named Terry who winds up in a hostage situation. Here I have to warn you that the scenes involving Vanessa's character will be disturbing to anyone who knew and loved her. Maniac Cop III: Badge of Silence was released on DVD by Blue Underground on November 19 2013. It was in 2021 that Blue Underground released the film in 4K UltraHD. Needless to say, it is readily available.Twenty Bucks (1992): Twenty Bucks was one of Vanessa's favourite movies she ever made and one of her most enjoyable experiences in her acting career. She even got to play a scene opposite Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd. The film follows a $20 bill as it passes from one person to the next. In the movie Vanessa plays Melanie, whose underage boyfriend wants to use the $20 bill to buy wine for their dinner.. Vanessa gives a great performance in Twenty Bucks, and the movie has a cast that would be incredible for a major studio picture, let alone a low budget, independent film. In addition to Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd, the film features Linda Hunt, Brendan Fraser, Gladys Knight, Elisabeth Shue, William H. Macy, and yet others.Twenty Bucks was released on VHS by Columbia TriStar Home Video on June 1 1994. It was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on July 5 2005. Sadly, Sony appears to have altered the film's aspect ratio so that it would better fit modern, widescreen television screens. If one wants to see Twenty Bucks in its original aspect radio, they will have to watch it on streaming.Blood In Blood Out (1993): Blood In Blood Out follows three Los Angeles Chicanos from their younger days in a street gang to when they are older, with one winding up in prison, another winding up an artist, and yet another winding up a police officer. Blood In Blood Out never received a wide release, but it became a cult film following its release on VHS and repeating showings on various premium channels in the Nineties. Vanessa plays a very small role in the film as it was released, appearing on screen for only a matter of minutes. She played the daughter of Montana, the leader of the prison gang La Onda in the film. Blood In Blood Out was released on DVD on June 13 2000. Father Hood (1993): Father Hood stars Patrick Swayze as a petty criminal, Jack Charles, facing prison time who breaks his children out of a corrupt, state run home. The three of them then make a cross country trek. In the film Vanessa plays a pregnant teenager who Jack also breaks out of the home. She is only on screen very briefly, but she does well with what time she has. Despite being released at the height of Patrick Swayze's career, Father Hood bombed at the box office. It also fared poorly with critics. Father Hood was released on DVD on April 6 2004. It is still readily available from various outlets.State of Emergency (1994): State of Emergency is an HBO made-for-TV movie that debuted on February 12 1994. It stars Joe Mantegna as emergency room doctor Dr. John Novelli, who finds himself in trouble after one of his patients dies. In the movie Vanessa played Violetta, the radiologist for the emergency room. State of Emergency was one of Vanessa's most enjoyable experiences in her career, particularly as she got to play opposite Richard Beymer, well-known as Tony in West Side Story (1961), a movie Vanessa loved. She said she was intimidated by Mr. Beymer at first, but he soon put her at ease and he was one of her favourite people she ever worked with. State of Emergency is the best TV movie Vanessa ever appeared in, with a strong script and the cast in top form. While it is not available on streaming, HBO released it on DVD on October 6 2009. It remains widely available.ER: Nurse Wendy Goldman is Vanessa's most famous role besides Ana Delgado in Stand and Deliver. She certainly excelled in the role. Well before Vanessa and I were friends, Wendy was always my favourite character on the show, and I know many other people for whom she was their favourite character as well. While ER was not always a pleasant experience for Vanessa, she was proud of her work on the show, as she well should be. She appeared on the first three seasons of the series.The first season of ER was released by Warner Home Video on August 26 2003. It was followed by the second season on April 27 2004 and the third season on April 26 2005. Since then the entire series has been released on DVD, with a box set of the complete series (all  15 seasons available). Melrose Place: During the first season of ER, while Vanessa playing Wendy Goldman on the show, she also guest starred in the third season episode of Melrose Place \"The Doctor That Rocks the Cradle.\" She played Linda Cortez, a young mother who has a stillborn baby. The episode aired on November 28 1994. Melrose Place is readily available on video. CBS Home Entertainment released the third season on DVD on November 13 2007. The Complete Series was released just last year, on October 4 2022. Fire & Ice (2001): Fire & Ice is a TV movie that debuted on BET on April 6 2001. It centres on the romance between a late night talk show host, Michael Williams (Kadem Hardison), and Holly Aimes (Lark Voorhies), the head of a home security firm and the daughter of a prominent politician. In the movie Vanessa plays Wanda Hernandez, a technician with Holly's security firm. She gets a good deal of screen time in Fire & Ice, and she does very well in the role. Also, in my humble opinion, Vanessa never looked lovelier on screen. Fire & Ice was released on DVD around the same time that it debuted on BET. It can still be easily found on a wide variety of sites."},
{"title": "Shock (1946)", "date": "Thursday, November 16, 2023", "text": "Psychiatry was a hot topic in the late Forties, so it should come as no surprise that it often plays a role in film noir. Often psychiatrists in any given noir were honest, hard-working individuals who cared about their patients, such as Dr. Ann Lorrison (Audrey Totter) in High Wall (1947). Other times they definitely were not. An example of the latter can be found in the little-known movie Shock (1946). In Shock (1946) Vincent Price plays Dr. Richard Cross, whose professional ethics leave much to be desired.Shock (1946) centres on Janet Stewart (Anabel Shaw), a young woman awaiting the arrival of her husband, whom she hasn't seen since he went off to war. While in her hotel room she looks out her window only to see a husband murder his wife. Witnessing a murder is too much for Janet and she goes into a state of catatonic shock. Unfortunately, when the hotel physician recommends Janet be sent to a specialist, that specialist turns out to be none other than the man whom Janet witnessed kill his wife, psychiatrist Dr. Richard Cross (Vincent Price). As might be expected, Dr. Cross has Janet sent to his own asylum, where he, assisted by his nurse and lover Elaine Jordan (Lynn Bari) plot to keep Janet from ever revealing what she knows. Shock (1946) originated as a story by Albert DeMond, who may be best remembered today for his work on many Republic serials. The screenplay was written by Eugene Ling and Martin Berkely. Eugene Ling had previously co-written the drama Within These Walls (1945), starring Thomas Mitchell. Martin Berkeley had acted on Broadway in the 1920s and he wrote the Broadway production Seen But Not Heard with Ruth Baumer. His play The Penalty was adapted for the screen as the 1941 film of the same name. With regards to film, he wrote several entries in the Dr. Gillespie series, and later wrote the screenplay for the classic sci-fi movie Tarantula (1955). 20th Century Fox initially planned Shock (1956) as a major motion picture to be directed by Henry Hathaway. As it turned out, the studio decided to scale back the budget for Shock (1956), and as a result the film was directed by Alfred L. Werker, who had directed such films as Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939) and A-Haunting We Will Go (1942). While Shock (1946) would be a B-picture, it would be one with \"A\" class cast. Vincent Price was cast in his first lead role as Dr. Cross. By this point in his career, Mr. Price was already well-established as a character actor and a supporting actor. Indeed, he had already appeared in the classics Laura (1944) and Leave Her to Heaven (1945). Lynn Barri was cast as Dr. Cross's accomplice, lover, and nurse, Elaine Jordan. She was well-known for playing alluring, but ultimately bad women in such films as Orchestra Wives (1942) and Chinal Girl (1942). After having broken free of such roles, she played what might be her most evil role with Elaine. While Shock (1946) had been demoted from an A picture to a B movie, it received promotion befitting a major motion picture. This was largely due to positive reviews from the trade papers. The review in Variety described Shock (1946) as \"good enough for top billing in many spots\" and stated that it \"should contribute strongly to box-office draw.\" Audiences took to Shock (1946) as well. The film ultimately made $800,000 at the box office, having been made for only $350,000. Upon its release, Shock (1946) received its share of positive reviews. The Los Angeles Herald-Examiner called the film, \"one of the best of the season\" and \"a terrific little picture.\"  Philip K. Scheuer in The Los Angeles Times called it a \"nominal B feature\" that screenwriter  \"Eugene Ling and Director Alfred Werker have imbued... with a grade-A suspense.\" Not all reviews were positive, however, as Bosley Crowther of The New York Times took outright offence to the film. He wrote, \"...there are thousands of veterans whose experiences during the war have rendered them more or less needful of psycho-therapy....Confidence in the doctor is of vital importance...a film such as Shock breeds just the opposite in distraught, suspicious minds.\"Bosley Crowther was not the only one offended by Shock (1946), as many in the psychiatric profession were also appalled by the film. The president of the American Psychiatric Association wrote a letter to MPAA president Eric Johnson in which he described Shock (1946) as \"...an unsuitable and undesirable picture to be shown to the general public and that it will do a good deal of harm.\" Dr, Manfred Sakel, who had developed insulin shock therapy in 1927 (it plays a pivotal role in the film), saw Shock (1946) and said that it was \"...stupidly done and terribly damaging to psychiatry.\"  As to movie censorship boards, censorship boards in  Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia removed all references to insulin shock therapy from the movie.Of course, as someone who minored in psychology, I have to point out that while insulin shock therapy was widely accepted in the 1940s, it would begin to fall out of favour in the 1950s. It would eventually become regarded as ineffective and even downright cruel and inhumane. Even at the height of its use, psychiatrists realized that insulin shock therapy could be dangerous. The hypoglycaemia induced by large doses of insulin could result in brain damage and even death. Given what we now know about insulin shock therapy, the portrayal of the treatment isn't nearly as offensive today as it must have been to the mental health profession in 1946. As to the portrayal of Dr. Richard Cross, it is understandable why many psychiatrists would have been offended, although there had been corrupt psychiatrists on screen before, notably Dr. Judd in Cat People (1942). While it is not one of his best remembered films, Shock (1946) was an important film in Vincent Price's career, and not simply because it was his first lead role. Dr. Cross can be considered the predecessor of the many mad scientists Vincent Price would play once he became firmly identified with the horror genre in the 1950s. In many respects, the not-so-good Dr. Cross can be considered the forerunner of Dr. Warren Chaplin in The Tingler (1959),  Dr. Eramus Craven in The Raven (1963), and Dr. Phibes in The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) and Dr. Phibes Rises Again (1972).In his review for Turner Classic Movies from 2006 when Shock (1946) was released on DVD as part of the Fox Film Noir series, author Jeremy Arnold wrote \"It's more of a Gothic thriller, complete with thunderstorms, a doctor gone bad, and an eerie sanitorium.\" While I agree with Mr. Arnold more often than not, this is one case where I do disagree with him. He is right in describing Shock (1946) as a Gothic thriller. Indeed, the movie even has overtones of the horror genre. Even so, I think it is also film noir. After all, Nurse Elaine Jordan, masterfully played by Lynn Barri, is very much a femme fatale in film noir mode, goading Dr. Cross towards the dark side. As Janet, Anabel Shaw is very much an ordinary person who finds herself in circumstances well beyond her control. The cinematography by Joseph MacDonald and Glen MacWilliams is also suitably noir, with some solid use of shadows and limited light sources. For me Shock (1946) is both a Gothic thriller and a film noir, and has overtones of horror.Regardless, Shock (1946) is an entertaining movie. It is a taut thriller with some great performances from the leads and a screenplay that does not scrimp on thrills. Perhaps the only shortcoming of Shock (1946) is that it could have benefited from a higher budget, with sets that sometimes look cheap even for a B-movie. While its sets may look cheap, Shock (1946) is ultimately a top-notch film and worth any fan of Gothic thrillers or film noirs checking out."},
{"title": "The CW's Best Days Are Behind It", "date": "Wednesday, November 15, 2023", "text": "The CW has always lagged behind the three older broadcast networks (NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox) in the ratings. Its ratings have always been lower than its predecessor, The WB, as well. Despite this, The CW developed a following, particularly among young people. Many of the programs it aired over the years maintain large fandoms to this day, including Smallville, Supernatural, Gossip Girl, The Flash, and Riverdale. Regardless of what one thought of many of the shows on The CW, many of them were successful. Sadly, I have to think that The CW will lose many of its long-time viewers this season. I know this will be the first season in over a decade in which I will watch nothing on The CW.The CW was formed in 2006 following the closures of The WB and UPN by Warner Bros. (the owner of The WB) and CBS Corporation (the owner of UPN). It was last year that Nexstar Media Group acquired The CW from Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery. Almost immediately NexStar began making changes to the network. They cancelled most of The CW's long-running scripted shows, leaving only All-American, All-American: Homecoming, Superman & Lois, and Walker. New shows, such as Walker: Independence (a prequel to Walker) and The Winchesters (a prequel to Supernatural) were cancelled after one season. In their place, The CW debuted shows that had originated elsewhere. Sullivan's Crossing is a Canadian show that originated on CTV, while The Swarm is a German show that originated on ZDF. FBOY Island is a reality show that originated on HBO Max, who cancelled it after two seasons. 61st Street is a show that had been cancelled by AMC. The CW also added sports programming to its schedule, including LIV Golf, the show 100 Days to Indy, and Inside the NFL.The CW's plan is to focus on viewers in the key demographic of 18-49, as well as even older viewers. The reason for this was summed up by the network's president, Dennis Miller (not the commentator and comedian), who said at upfronts this past May, \"The young adult audience is not making an appointment with broadcast today. That audience has abandoned broadcast, hence the opportunity we have to broaden the audience.\" On the surface, it then makes sense for The CW to broaden its audience from people in their teens and twenties to older people. It would certainly help with the ratings.The problem is that, as Nexstar's chief operating officer Tom Carter pointed out last August, while The CW's programming was targeted at the 18-38 demographic, the average viewer of its broadcasts was 58 years old. It then seems to me that The CW already had an older audience, even if it was much smaller than those of NBC, CBS, ABC, or Fox. In cancelling long-running shows like Kung Fu and Stargirl, they could very well drive away what little of the older audience they have. Indeed, as I said, this will be the first time in over a decade that I will watch nothing on The CW.Okay, granted, I could well be atypical of my generation when it comes to what I like on television. I like genre shows like Stargirl and The Winchesters. I detest unscripted shows like FBOY Island (even the title is nauseating). I have no interest in watching golf (honestly, I don't know anyone who does). I actually watch very little on broadcast television, preferring the offerings on the various streaming services. Even so, I don't think I am that atypical for an older Gen Xer. Almost nothing that The CW is offering this season appeals to me. Sullivan's Crossing? It looks to me like a romance series of the sort that appeals primarily to older female Boomers. Inside the NFL? Even when I was an NFL fan (I ceased being one when the Rams left St. Louis), I didn't watch sports commentary shows. 61st Street? I didn't watch it when it was on AMC. Why would I now? About the only show they have scheduled to air this season that somewhat interests me is The Spencer Sisters, a CTV show about two mystery solving sisters. And I would more likely watch it on streaming than I would on broadcast television. If other Gen Xers, not to mention Millennials and Zoomers as well, are like me, they may find nothing on The CW that appeals to them. In other words, The CW might have a much smaller audience than they ever did before.On top of this, I think The CW's insistence on concentrating on broadcast could easily backfire. The sad truth is that broadcast television is becoming a thing of the past, A bulk of the older networks' audience watch their shows on On Demand or on streaming. And it is not just younger people who watch shows on On Demand or streaming. I aged out of the key demo of 18-49 long ago and, as I said, the bulk of what I watch is on streaming. On any given week the only thing I might watch live on a broadcast network is the evening news. Of course, all of this could well defeat NexStar's goal of making the network profitable. The money they save by importing shows from Canada or obtaining them from elsewhere won't make up for the advertising dollars they could lose because they have lost their audience. As always, ratings are king when it comes to television advertising.  In fact, I think instead of importing shows and airing unscripted shows, NexStar would be better off following the lead of ABC in the Fifties and Sixties. I don't think many people realize it, but in the Fifties and Sixties ABC lagged well behind the two older networks, NBC and CBS, in the ratings. There were even times when it was questionable whether the network would last. ABC survived essentially through counterprogramming, airing shows that were different from what CBS and NBC were airing. They aired Westerns like Maverick and detective shows like Surfside 6 against sitcoms and variety shows. They also pursued the key demographic with youthful programming, such as 77 Sunset Strip and Shindig. Most of all they were not afraid to shake things up. ABC aired the ultraviolent show The Untouchables, which proved to be a success. They showed The Fugitive, a drama filled with existentialist angst. It also proved popular. They aired Batman, the smash hit of the 1965-1966 season, done in a camp style and as close to a comic book on film as television has ever gotten. While I am not going to say that The CW should have continued with superhero shows, which seem to have run their course, or teen dramas, which appear to be passée, I am saying the shows they are debuting this season don't seem terribly different from what the older networks or even cable channels are airing. Now I will admit that I could be wrong. Maybe NexStar's strategy of relying on shows imported from other countries, shows obtained from elsewhere, and unscripted shows could pay off. At the very least such a strategy would save money. I do think their decision to start showing sports was wise (even if I would have chosen something different from golf). That having been said, I don't think I am wrong. As a viewer I know what I like and what I like is not airing on The CW this season or any of the other broadcast networks, for that matter. And I am willing to bet other viewers, at least those around my age, may be the same way. If that is the case, The CW may see its ratings decrease and as a result once more fail to make a profit."},
{"title": "\"In a Lonely Place\" by The Smithereens", "date": "Tuesday, November 14, 2023", "text": "Among the songs on The Smithereens' debut album, Especially for You, is one inspired by a classic film noir. \"In a Lonely Place\" is based on the classic 1950 film noir of the same name starring Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame. It was written by the late Pat DiNizio, the lead singer and songwriter of The Smithereens. Pat DiNizio was well known for his love of classic movies. It was only a few days before his untimely death in 2017 that he posted about the classic films he planned to watch.Not only is \"In a Lonely Place\" inspired by In a Lonely Place (1950), but it even paraphrases the movie's most famous line. At one point in the film Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) says, \"I was born when she kissed me. I died when she left me. I lived a few weeks while she loved me.\" This is paraphrased in  \"In a Lonely Place\" as \"I was born the day I met you,/Lived a while when you loved me,/Died a little when we broke apart.\" Later in the film Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) says to Captain Lochner (Carl Benton Reid) of the LAPD, \"Yesterday, this would've meant so much to us. Now it doesn't matter..it doesn't matter at all.\" This is reflected in the song's lyrics as well, in the lines \"Yesterday, it would have mattered./Now today, it doesn't mean a thing.\"\"In a Lonely Place is notable for featuring backing vocals by Suzanne Vega. Originally, Pat DiNizio had wanted Brazilian singer Astrid Gilberto, best known in the United States for the hit \"The Girl from Ipanema,\" but he approached her about the song at one of her concerts in New York City, she simply said, \"Call my manager.\" Pat DiNizio then figured she wasn't interested, and reached out to his friend Suzanne Vega.Despite being one of The Smithereens' best songs, \"In a Lonely Place\" did very little on various charts, although it did go to no. 5 on the UK Indie Chart."},

He also co-created the TV show Remington Steele and directed such movies as The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969).Robert Butler was born on November 16 1927 in Hollywood. He grew up in the Los Angeles Westside, where he attended University High School. When he was a teenager he played trombone and played with the band on Hoagy Carmichael's radio show on NBC. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles, from which he graduated with a degree in English. After graduating from college he got a job as an usher at CBS. He went from being an usher to a receptionist, and then a production clerk, and stage manager before becoming an assistant director. He served as an associate director on the anthology shows Climax! and Playhouse 90.  He broke into television directing with an episode of Hennesey in 1959. In the late Fifties he also directed episodes of Dobie Gillis, Happy, and The DuPont Show with June Allyson.In the Sixties Robert Butler was an established director who was very much in demand. He directed the very first pilot for Star Trek, \"The Cage,\" starring Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike and Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock. He also directed the pilot for Batman, \"Hi Diddle Riddle\"/\"Smack in the Middle,\" as well as the first episode featuring The Penguin (Burgess Meredith) and the first episode featuring Mr. Freeze. He also directed the first episode of Hogan's Heroes, as well as several other episodes. During the decade Mr. Butler directed episodes of the shows Peter Loves Mary, Have Gun--Will Travel, Michael Shayne, Bonanza, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Dick Powell Show, The Gertrude Berg Show. The Rifleman, Follow the Sun, The Detectives, Stoney Burke, The Untouchables, Dr. Kildare, The Richard Boone Show, The Greatest Show on Earth, Ben Casey, Espionage, The Lieutenant, Arrest and Trial, The Twilight Zone, The Defenders, Run for Your Life, The Virginian, Mister Roberts, The Fugitive, Walt Dinsey's Wonderful World of Color, Blue Light, Shane, I Spy, Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, Gunsmoke, The Invaders, N.Y.P.D., Judd for the Defense, Ironside, Cimarron Strip, The Felony Squad, Mission: Impossible, CBS Playhouse, The Outcasts, Then Came Bronson, and Lancer. He directed the movies Guns in the Heather (1969) and The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969). In the Seventies Robert Butler directed the four-part mini-series The Blue Knight. for which he won an Emmy Award. He directed episodes of the shows Nichols, Gunsmoke, Hawaii Five-O, Doc Elliott, Kung Fu, Roll Out!, The Waltons, Columbo, and Insight. He directed the movies The Barefoot Executive (1971), Scandalous John (1971), Now You See Him, Now You Don't (1971), The Ultimate Thrill (1974), and Hot Lead and Cold Feet (1978). In the Eighties Robert Butler co-created the series Remington Steele. He also directed the pilot and several other episodes. He served as an executive consultant on the show. Later in the decade he served as an executive consultant and executive producer on Midnight Caller. He also directed one episode of the show. He directed the pilot for Hill Street Blues, as well as five other episodes. He also directed the pilot for Moonlighting. In the Eighties he also directed episodes of Our Family Honor and Out on a Limb. He directed the movie Up the Creek (1984).

He directed the movie Turbulence (1997). In the Naughts he directed the pilot for the TV series The Division. His last work was the theatrical short \"Where Do the Balloons Go?\" in 2009.Robert Butler was very much in demand when it came to directing the pilots or first episodes of television shows, and there is no wonder that he was. Mr. Butler had the uncanny knack to capture the tone of a television show immediately. While the only familiar character to most audiences in the Star Trek pilot \"The Cage,\" it is still recognizably Star Trek and it set the tone for everything that was to come. \"Hi Diddle Riddle\"/\"Smack in the Middle,\" the pilot for Batman, is not only one of the best television pilots ever made, but it also set the tone for the show. Robert Butler similarly set the tone for the shows Hogan's Heroes, Moonlighting, and Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Of course, Robert Butler directed many hours of television besides pilots, where he still showed an ability of capturing the feel of a show. Indeed, he was very versatile, able to direct everything from sitcoms to science fiction shows to dramas. He directed some of the best episodes of various shows, including The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Untouchables, and Kung Fu. Of course, he also directed films. And while his movies may not be counted among the greatest classic, they are entertaining and well done. I have no doubt many Gen Xers have found memories of The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes and The Barefoot Executive. Robert Butler was an exceedingly talented director who had a talent for getting television shows off on the right foot."},
{"title": "Wes Studi: Vietnam Veteran", "date": "Saturday, November 11, 2023", "text": "Aside from Will Rogers, Wes Studi may well be the most famous Cherokee actor of all time. He also happens to number among my favourite actors. In addition to being a talented actor and an advocate for Native Americans, he also served in the Vietnam War.Wes Studi was born on December 17 1947 in Nofire Hollow, Oklahoma. He attended Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, from which he graduated in 1964. He was 17 years old when he enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard. He received basic combat training and advanced individual training at Fort Polk in Louisiana. He had one year remaining with the National Guard when he volunteered for active duty in the United States Army. He was sent with A Company, 3rd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division to Vietnam, where he served for twelve months. He arrived in Vietnam not long before the beginning of e “Mini-Tet” Offensive, when the Northern Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong attacked Saigon. According to Wes Studi, he did not take part in any of the fighting that took place in and around Saigon. His unit was stationed at a place called the French Fort on one of the rivers of the Mekong delta.

{"title": "Shield for Murder (1954)", "date": "Thursday, November 9, 2023", "text": "For much of the Golden Age of Hollywood, corrupt police officers were rarely seen on the big screen. Much of the reason for this was probably because in the MPAA Production Code's list of subjects that must be treated with special care were \"...titles or scenes having to do with law enforcement or law-enforcing officers.\" By the late Forties the Production Code had started to weaken, so that dishonest cops began to appear increasingly on screen, particularly in film noir. Among the movies that featured a very corrupt cop was Shield for Murder (1954).In Shield for Murder the years have taken their toll on police detective Lieutenant Barney Nolan (Edmond O'Brien). Once a good cop, he has grown jaded and even downright dishonourable. Indeed, in the first few minutes of Shield for Murder, he shoots a bookie in the back and then takes $25,000 from the dead body. Barney's cover story is that he had to shoot the bookie because he had tried to get away. Both his friend Sergeant Mark Brewster (John Agar) and the chief of detectives, Captain Gunnarson (Emile Meyer) initially believe Barney's story, but as Barney tries to cover his tracks, it becomes obvious to Mark that Barney's behaviour has not been at all above board.Shield for Murder was based on the 1951 novel of the same name by William P. McGivern. William P. McGivern may be best remembered for the novel The Big Heat, upon which the 1953 film of the same name was based. Mr. McGivern wrote two other novels about corrupt cops, both of which would be adapted as motion pictures: the 1954 novel Rogue Cop, adapted as the 1954 film of the same name, and the 1957 novel Odds Against Tomorrow, adapted as the 1959 movie of the same name. While Shield for Murder features one of Edmond O'Brien's best performances, he was not producer Aubrey Schenck's first choice for the film. In the April 13 1952 issue of Variety, it was reported that he planned to produce Shield for Murder with Dana Andrews in the lead. The April 22 1954 issue of The Los Angeles Times reported that shooting on Shield for Murder would begin in May and Edmond O'Brien would be the lead and \"production advisor.\" Finally, Edmond O'Brien was announced as the film's co-director with Howard W. Koch. Shield for Murder would mark the directorial debut for Edmond O'Brien. Edmond O'Brien had long wanted to direct, and over the years there had been a few projects to which his name had been attached. In 1952 it he was announced as the director of a film to be called The Murder, but unfortunately the script wound up being sold to RKO, where it became the movie Angel Face (1953), directed by Otto Preminger. He had hopes of both directing and acting in a film called A Few Flowers for Shiner, based on a story by Richard Llewellyn (author of How Green Was My Valley), but that project fell through and the movie was never made.With Shield for Murder he finally got his chance to direct.Shield for Murder (1954) premiered in New York City on August 27 1954, and was released the following month. It did very well at the box office. In the book It Came from Horrorwood: Interviews with Moviemakers in the SF and Horror Tradition by Tom Weaver, producer Aubrey Schrenck said of Shield for Murder, \"That money grossed a lot  of money, you wouldn't believe how much; on television it made a fortune.\" Shield for Murder also received its share of positive reviews. In The New York Times The reviewer wrote of the film, \"The story is intelligent and unstrained; qualities too rarely seen in films of this genre. There is little or no padding (a major achievement) and, although the direction sometimes smacks of haste, talent is definitely indicated.\" According to the biography Edmond O'Brien: Everyman of Film Noir by Derek Sculthorpe, not every critic thought so highly of Shield for Murder, with some having problems with the film's story. One person who was not a fan of Shield for Murder was Lloyd T. Binford, the notorious Chairman of the Memphis Board of Censors. The film was banned from theatres in Memphis, Tennessee. The Memphis Board of Censors' Chairman stated Shield for Murder was banned because \"it appears to be a burlesque of the police department.\" In his letters to United Artists, Binford wrote, \"It is a shady picture reflecting on the police department with apparently one half of the actors dumbells and the other half crooks; with most of the women of questionable character. There were no uniforms on any of the police force or officers.\" In response United Artist said that there were two women in the film, one a girl in a bar and the other the detective's ladylike fiance. They also pointed out that the police officers' lack of uniforms would seem to be explained by the fact that they are detectives, plainclothesmen. Edmond O'Brien is one of the names most associated with film noir, having appeared in such films as The Killers (1946), D.O.A. (1949), and The Hitch-Hiker (1953), among other noirs. Despite this, Shield for Murder is not particularly well-known, even if it isn't exactly obscure either. There is every reason it should be better known, as it numbers among Mr. O'Brien's best films. Shield for Murder was strong stuff for 1954, and it remains intense to this day. Indeed, it is in the first few minutes of the film that Barney Nolan murders the bookmaker, setting the film's plot in motion. Never before and never again would Edmond O'Brien play a character quite as disturbing as  Barney Nolan. He delivers a brutal beating to private detectives. At one point he even slaps his girlfriend. Worst of all, he kills with little in the way of remorse. The supporting cast delivers performances as fine as that of Edmond O'Brien. John Agar is convincing as Barney's best friend and partner, Mark Brewster, who comes to realize that Barney has lost any sense of decency. Marla English delivers a fine performance as Barney's girlfriend in what is quite possibly the most difficult role in the film. The rest of the cast also does well, from Carolyn Jones in a small part as a woman in a bar to Herb Butterfield as reporter Cabot, the first person to doubt Barney's story about the bookie's death.Shield for Murder is not often seen on television, but fortunately it is available on DVD and is available on YouTube. It is a tough-minded film noir that has lost very little of its ability to shock even today. Although it might not be as well known as such classics as Double Indemnity (1944) or Out of the Past (1947), it is very much one of those essential movies that any film noir fan should make a point to see."},
{"title": "The 60th Anniversary of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963)", "date": "Tuesday, November 7, 2023", "text": "If someone wanted an example of epic comedy, they could do no better than the movie It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). The movie had a huge cast, to the point that it holds the record for the largest number of speaking parts in a film, with over 50 major parts and over 300 minor parts. It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World also featured more big names in comedy than any other film, ranging from Silent movie star Buster Keaton to currently popular comedian Jonathan Winters. Even its running time was epic. The original cut ran 202 minutes, which was trimmed down to 192 minutes for its premiere. The theatrical release still clocked in at over 2 hours, running 161 minutes. Regardless of its length, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World proved to be a success, and has been popular ever since. It was sixty years ago today, on November 7, 1963, that It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World premiered in Los Angeles. In It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, convict Smiler Grogan (Jimmy Durante) crashes his car on California State Route 74. Several people rush to investigate the crash, including dentist Melville Crump (Sid Caesar) and his wife Monica (Edie Adams); Ding Bell (Mickey Rooney) and Benjy Benjamin (Buddy Hackett), two friends travelling to Las Vegas; Lennie Pike (Jonathan Winters), a furniture mover; and J. Russell Finch (Milton Berle), a businessman who has his wife Emmeline (Dorothy Provine) and his mother-in-law Mrs. Marcus (Ethel Merman) with him. With his dying breath, Smiler tells this group of a stash of $350,000 he buried in Santa Rosita State Park under \"a big W.\" The group then begins a mad dash to reach Santa Rosita State Park to retrieve the money. Along the way, others join in the search for the money. This brings the group of treasure hunters to the attention of  Santa Rosita Police Captain T. G. Culpepper (Spencer Tracy), who had been investigating the Smiler Grogan case.It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World originated with screenwriter William Rose, an American expatriate living in the United Kingdom. He had written the screenplays for the movie Genevieve (1953), which dealt with the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, and the classic caper comedy The Ladykillers (1955). He had an idea for a film, which he initially called So Many Thieves, which centred on a chase through Scotland. While he had written several successful films for Ealing Studios in the Fifties, by the early Sixties he found it difficult to find work. He then went to California and pitched So Many Thieves to producer and director Stanley Kramer, along with four other ideas. At the time Stanley Kramer was best known for his various \"message\" films, including The Defiant Ones (1959), Inherit the Wind (1960), and Judgement at Nuremberg (1961). Nonetheless, Stanley Kramer agreed to direct the movie. In fact, his goal became to make \"...a comedy to end all comedies.\"The title of the film would also change as William Rose and Stanley Kramer worked on the project. Initially called Something a Little Less Serious, it was then titled Where, But in America? and then One Damn Thing After Another. At last, it received the title It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. The plot of the film was also moved from Scotland to the United States.Of course, to make a comedy to end all comedies, Stanley Kramer would need a cast of comic legends. Various actors were considered for lead roles. In the October 30 1962 issue of Daily Variety it was reported that Jack Benny had turned down the role of Captain Culpepper as filming would conflict with production of his weekly television show, although he did consent to a cameo. According to an article in the January 27 1962 issue of The Los Angeles Times, Carol Channing was cast to play opposite Sid Caesar, a role ultimately played by Edie Adams in the film. Both Martha Raye and Cara Williams were considered for roles, but neither ultimately appeared in the movie. Stan Laurel was offered the cameo of a man driving through the desert, but he turned it down as he did not want to work without his late partner Oliver Hardy, who had died in 1957. The role then went to Jack Benny. According to the the August 20 1962 issue of Daily Variety, Frank Faylen had accepted a role in the film, but had to back out due to conflicts with production of his show Dobie Gillis.Befitting the epic it was intended to be, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World was shot using a wide-screen process. It was filmed in  Ultra Panavision 70 and shown in Cinerama. In fact, it was promoted as the first movie to be made in \"one-projector\" Cinerama. Originally, Cinerama required three different cameras and the reels would be shown using three projectors. The movie was filmed on location throughout a wide part of California. The start of film was shot on California State Route 74, near Palm Desert, in the extreme southern part of the sate. A good portion of the film was shot in Long Beach, including the exterior of the Santa Rosita Police Department, a hardware store, the Harbor Pontoon Bridge, and various other parts of the city through which the chase proceeded. Airport terminal scenes were shot at  Rancho Conejo Airport in Newbury Park, California, which is no longer open. Both  Sonoma County Airport and the Palm Springs International Airport were used for various airplane scenes. The fictional Santa Rosita Park was actually Portuguese Point in Palo Verdes, California. A set was constructed there for the movie, complete with flowers, shrubbery, and the palm trees forming \"the big W.\" Filming began on April 16 1962 and ended on December 6 1962. Given the number of stunts in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, it should come as no surprise that around thirty-nine stuntmen were hired for the film and it actually had an action budget of $252,000. The stunt supervisor on It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World was Carey Loftin, whose career as a stuntman went back to the Thirties. He had worked on such films as House of Dracula (1945), Raw Deal (1948), Mighty Joe Young (1949), and Thunder Road (1958). He later served as a stunt coordinator on such films as Point Blank (1967), Bullitt (1968), and Vanishing Point (1971). The animated opening credits for It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World were designed by the legendary Saul Bass. He was already known for designing titles for several movies, among them Carmen Jones (1954), North by Northwest (1959), Ocean's 11 (1960), and West Side Story (1961). At a little over four minutes, it was the longest credits sequence he ever designed. The animation was directed by William T Hurtz, who had previously worked for UPA and Jay Ward Productions. Among the animators who worked on the credits was Bill Melendez, who would soon become famous for the \"Charlie Brown\" specials.The movie's score was composed by Ernest Gold, who had also composed the scores of Stanley Kramer's movies On the Beach (1959), Inherit the Wind (1960), and Judgement at Nurembert (1961). Ernest Gold's theme for It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World had lyrics composed by Mack David. The vocal version of the theme served as the entrance music for the movie. Ernest Gold's score was not the only original music to be heard in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. The film had a cross-promotion deal with both Baskin-Robbins and The Shirelles, whose song \"31 Flavors\" can be heard on a radio in one scene. The Shirelles also covered the theme to It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Both their cover of the theme and \"31 Flavors\" appeared on their album The Shirelles-Sing Their Songs in the Movie It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World premiered at the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles on November 7 1963. The premiere was extra-special as it was also the opening of the Cinerama Dome, making It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World the first movie ever shown at the theatre. The Cinerama Dome was the first new movie theatre built in Hollywood in 33 years. While it is now regarded as a classic, reviews for It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World were mixed upon its initial release. Bosley Crowther gave the film a positive review, writing, \"They have put them together in a story that has eruptive energy and speed; and they have got a bunch of actors to perform it with the fervor of demented geniuses.\" His only real problems with the movie were that \"..it runs too long\" and \"There is simply too much wild confusion, too much repetition of similar things.\" Variety also gave It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World a good review, noting, \"It's a mad, mad, mad, mad picture. Being a picture of extravagant proportions, even its few flaws are king-sized, but the plusses far outweigh the minuses.\" Richard L. Coe in his review in The Washington Post was more modest in his review of the film, writing, \"Yes, it is furious, fast and funny and it is also vast, vulgar and vexatious because Kramer has not given us one sympathetic character and because it is shown in Cinerama.\" Philip K. Scheuer's review in The Los Angeles Times tended to be largely negative. He wrote the movie \"...really bugged me...\" and called it \"...a savage morality play in the guise of comedy.\"While critics may have disagreed over It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, audiences appeared to be united in their love for the film going by its box office. The movie grossed $46,332,858 domestically and $60,000,000 worldwide. Ultimately, it was the 3rd highest grossing film of 1963, after Cleopatra and How the West was Won. Unfortunately, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World cost so much to make that it only made a profit of $1.25 million. As a result of the enduring popularity of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, it would be shown on all three broadcast networks in the Seventies. It made its broadcast network debut on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies on October 28 1972. It aired again on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies on March 9 1974. After being shown on NBC, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World aired on CBS. The Tiffany Network aired the movie on New Year's Eve, December 31 1976 on The CBS Friday Night Movie. CBS showed it again on The CBS Tuesday Night Movie on May 16 1978. Finally, ABC aired It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World on July 16 1979, the last time it was shown on a broadcast network. After being shown on all three broadcast networks, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World began airing on HBO in October 1980 and was also shown on such cable channels as WTBS. It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World also proved popular on Canadian television. In fact, it became something of a New Year's Eve tradition. CTV aired the film every year on New Year's Eve from the late Seventies into the Eighties.As might be expected, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World has seen multiple releases on home media. A 1991 VHS and LaserDisc release ran 183 minutes, using elements that had been stored in a Los Angeles warehouse. According to film preservationist Robert A. Harris in a 2002 interview with Home Theater Forum, this version included footage not meant to ever be shown in any version and thus did not represent the original roadshow version of the film. Robert A. Harris later restored It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World to as close to the original roadshow cut as possible. This version was released on DVD and Blu-Ray on January 21 2014. Prior to It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Stanley Kramer was best known for his often weighty \"message\" films. He had tackled such subjects as  racism (The Defiant Ones), nuclear war (On the Beach), and Nazism (Judgement at Nuremerg). On the surface, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World would appear to depart from Mr. Kramer's earlier oeuvre. That having been said, it does not take a very close examination of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World to realize that the movie deals with the dangers of greed. After all, it centres on a group of ordinary people who, upon learning of a buried treasure, leave a path of destruction across a good section of California. In this respect, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World fits in perfectly with Stanley Kramer's heavy dramas. It just happens to be much less serious in tone. It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World would have a lasting influence. The film's success would lead to other epic comedies in the Sixties, including Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines; Or, How I Flew from London to Paris in 25 Hours and 11 Minutes (1965),  The Great Race (1965), The Loved One (1965), Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), and Monte Carlo or Bust! (1969).  It would also lead to other comedies featuring large ensemble casts searching for treasure, including Scavenger Hunt (1979), Million Dollar Mystery (1987), and Rat Race (2001). Perhaps the most lasting impact of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World is that, through its continued popularity, it has introduced generations to many comedy greats. For many Gen Xers, Millennials, and Zoomers, the movie might well be the first time they ever saw such legends as Eddie Anderson, Sid Caesar, Buster Keaton, Phil Silvers, and yet others. Many may have sought out other movies starring these greats of comedy, so that ultimately they may well become classic movie buffs.Even with the many epic comedies that have been made since It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, it still stands as a singular achievement. It featured more comedy legends than any other movie before or since. It also proved to be somewhat of a pioneering film, insofar as it was one of the earliest comedies to feature extensive stunts and several action sequences. Since then comedies from The Blues Brothers (1980) to Rat Race (2001) have featured impressive stunts and a good deal of action. It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World might not have been the first epic comedy, but it was certainly the one that put the genre on the map."},
{"title": "Burt Young, Joan Evans, and Matthew Perry Pass On", "date": "Sunday, November 5, 2023", "text": "October saw the deaths of several beloved actors, so many that it has been difficult to keep up. Each one of these performers deserves their own eulogy, but I really do not want my blog to be dominated by posts on celebrity deaths. For that reason, I am addressing each one of these actors in a single post.Burt Young died on October 8 2023 at the age of 83. He was perhaps best known for playing Rocky's best friend and brother-in-law Paulie in the \"Rocky\" movies. He also appeared in the movies Chinatown (1974)  and Once Upon a Time in America (1984).Burt Young was born Gerald DeLouise on April 30 1940 in New York City. He grew up in Queens. From 1957 to 1959 he served in the United States Marine Corps. While in the Marine Corps he boxed, winning 32 out of 34 bouts. After his service continued as a boxer. He worked as a  carpet cleaner, salesman, and installer while studying acting at the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg.Burt Young made his television debut in an episode of the soap opera The Doctors in 1969. He made his movie debut in Carnival of Blood in 1970. During his career he appeared in such films as The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight (1971), Cinderella Liberty (1973), Chinatown (1974), Rocky (1976), Once Upon a Time in America (1984), The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984), and Betsy's Wedding (1990). His last appearance in a film during his lifetime was The Final Code (2021). On television she starred on the sitcom Roomies and the mini-series Vendetta: Secrets of a Mafia Bride and The Last Don. He guest starred on such shows as M*A*S*H, Little House on the Prairie, Baretta, The Rockford Files, Miami Vice, The Equalizer, Tales from the Crypt, Law & Order, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, The Sopranos, and Kevin Can Wait.Burt Young may always be remembered best for playing tough guys, but he could play other sorts of roles as well. In Roomies he played a former Marine drill sergeant who becomes friends with his 14 year old boy genius room mate, the two helping each other navigate college. In the M*A*S*H episode \"L.I.P.\" he played Lt. Willis, a by-the-book C.I.D. officer investigating the application of the unit's corporals to marry a Korean woman. Of course, he did play many tough guy roles. In Chinatown he played Curly, who does not take his wife's infidelity at all well. Of course, in the \"Rocky\" movies Paulie is both an alcoholic and a cynic who nonetheless cares for Rocky and Rocky's sister. Burt Young was a very talented actor who consistently gave good performances. Joan Evans died on October 21 2023 at the age of 89. She appeared in such movies as On the Loose (1951) and It Grows on Trees (1952).Joan Evans was born Joan Eunson on July 18 1934 in New York City. Her father was author Dale Eunson. Her mother was screenwriter Katharine Albert. She was named for actress Joan Crawford, who was her godmother. Joan Evans was only 14 when she appeared in her first film, playing the title role in Roseanna McCoy. She appeared in such movies as On the Loose (1951), Skirts Ahoy! (1952), It Grows on Trees (1952), A Strange Adventure (1956), and The Walking Target (1960). On television she guest starred on the shows General Electric Theatre, Climax!, The Millionaire, Cheyenne, 77 Sunset Strip, Wagon Train, Zorro, Tales of Wells Fargo and Laramie. In the early Sixties she retired from acting to care for her family. She was later an editor at Hollywood Studio Magazine and taught at  the Carden Academy in Van Nuys.Joan Evans played a variety of roles in her career. In her movie debut as Roseanna McCoy she played a young member of the McCoy clan involved in a forbidden romance with a Hatfield. In Skirts Ahoy! she played a Midwestern girl-next-door who had been dumped by her boyfriend and, as a result, joined the WAVES. In the Laramie episode \"The Killer Legend\" she played the wife of an ex-convict who maintained his innocence. Joan Evans's acting career was not terribly long, but she left behind several good performances.Matthew Perry, best known for playing Chandler Bing on all ten seasons of Friends, died on October 28 2023 at the age of 54. Matthew Perry was born on August 19 1969 in Williamstown, Massachusetts. His father was John Bennett Perry who starred in the TV shows 240-Robert and Falcon Crest. His mother was Canadian journalist Suzanne Marie. His parents divorced not long after he was born, and he was raised by his mother in Ottawa, Ontario. He was 15 years old when he moved to Los Angeles to live with his father. Matthew Perry made his television debut in 1979 when he had a guest appearance on 240-Robert. He studied acting at  The Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, California. While in high school he studied improv at L.A. Connection. Prior to Friends, he starred in the short-lived shows Second Chance,  Sydney and.Home Free. He guest starred on such shows as Charles in Charge, Silver Spoons, The Tracy Ullman Show, Highway to Heaven. Growing Pains and Beverly Hills 90120. It was in 1994 that he began a ten year stint playing Chandler Bing on the sitcom Friends. He would be nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy in 2002 for the role. Following Friends, Matthew Perry starred on the shows Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, Mr. Sunshine, Go On, and The Odd Couple. He guest starred on such shows as The Simpsons, Ally McBeal, The West Wing, Scrubs, and The Good Wife. He also appeared in movies, including She's Out of Control (1989), Fools Rush In (1997), The Whole Nine Yards (2000), and 17 Again (2009). Matthew Perry created the show Mr. Sunshine and developed the show The Odd Couple for television.I think it is safe to say Matthew Perry will always be best remembered as the sardonic Chandler Bing on Friends, and it is with good reason. While I think Friends declined in quality in its later seasons, Matthew Perry was always good as Chandler. Of course, it must be kept in mind he also played many other roles. On Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip he played Matt Able, a former writer who takes over the production of the fictional sketch comedy show Studio 60. On The West Wing he played Joe Quincy, a Republican lawyer who became Associate White House Counsel for President Bartlett (Martin Sheen). In The Whole Nine Yards, Matthew Perry played Oz Oseransky, a dentist who realizes his neighbour is a contract killer. Matthew Perry could play drama and comedy equally well, although he had a real gift comedy. His timing was perfect and he could deliver a line better than anyone else. He made any show or movie better with his performances."},

{"title": "Our Miss Brooks : \"Mr. Conklin's Halloween Breakdown\"", "date": "Monday, October 30, 2023", "text": "Many older people, as well as Gen Xers like me who got to see it in reruns, have fond memories of Our Miss Brooks. It was a popular sitcom in the Fifties, and one of the earliest television shows to be adapted as a motion picture (Our Miss Brooks in 1956). While Our Miss Brooks was a popular television show, it had originated on radio. And like many radios shows, it had a Halloween episode. Its title was \"Mr. Conklin's Halloween Breakdown.\"Our Miss Brooks starred Eve Arden as Constance \"Connie\" brooks, a much put-upon, very much single English teacher at Madison High School. The principal at Madison High School was the gruff and often demanding Osgood Conklin (Gale Gordon). Philip Boynton (Jeff Chandler) was the shy biology teacher at Madison High School, and the object of Miss Brooks's affection, although he had absolutely no clue how she felt. Walter Dention (Richard Crenna) was one of Miss Brooks's students who had a high-pitched voice. He usually had good intentions, although his sheer clumsiness sometimes got in the way. Fabian \"Stretch\" Davis (Leonard Smith) was the none-too-bright star athlete at Madison High School and Walter's best friend. Margaret Davis (Jane Morgan) was Miss Brooks's landlady, who tended to be a bit absentminded and loved to cook exotic breakfasts that were more often than not inedible.In  \"Mr. Conklin's Halloween Breakdown\" Walter Dention and some of the other Madison High students are planning a Halloween Party. What is more, they plan to have it at Connie Brooks's apartment, Miss Davis having already agreed. Miss Brooks is opposed to having the party at her apartment, until she learns Mr. Boynton will be attending. While Miss Brooks and the students are getting ready for Halloween, Mr. Conklin is under a great deal of stress and is told by his doctor that he is on the verge of a nervous collapse. When Miss Brooks and the students learn of Mr. Conklin's condition, they decide to hold the party at his house as a way of cheering him up. As it turns out, Miss Brooks slips up and tells Mr. Conklin about the party, thinking that he had already learned of it. Mr. Conklin really doesn't want to be around a large group of people, and so Miss Brooks tells him that he can just relax at her apartment while the party is taking place. Unfortunately, Mr. Boynton and the students have decided to show up at Miss Brooks' apartment to surprise her in their costumes. After Miss Brooks and Mr. Conklin arrive at her apartment, he then sees Mr. Boynton in his skeleton costume, Walter as a ghost, and Stretch as Hopalong Cassidy, leading him to think he has had his nervous breakdown and is now seeing things. Of course, everything is straightened out in the end.  \"Mr. Conklin's Halloween Breakdown\" aired on October 30 1949. It was sponsored by Colgate and featured ads for Colgate's Dental Cream and Lustre-Creme shampoo. It would be the only Halloween episode of Our Miss Brooks on either radio or television. While many shows that made the transition from radio to television would adapt old radio scripts to the new medium, \"Mr. Conklin's Halloween Breakdown\"was never re-made as an episode of the television show. This is sad, as it is one of the funniest episode of the radio show Our Miss Brooks, and it would have lent itself quite well to television. The premise is original, particularly for a Halloween episode, and the cast is in top form. While Gale Gordon is known as one of the masters of the \"slow burn,\" he also had a talent for playing a man on the edge of a nervous breakdown.The radio show Our Miss Brooks ran on CBS from 1948 to 1957. It made the transition to television in 1952 and it would run until 1956. The television show would be successful in syndication. In the Eighties it aired on various cable channels, and it still resurfaces on nostalgia channels such as MeTV from time to time. Episodes can now be found on the streaming service Tubi. As to the radio version, it is widely available on CD, and can be found streaming on sites from YouTube to the various Old Time Radio sites. Fans of Old Time Radio and sitcoms really should check out  \"Mr. Conklin's Halloween Breakdown,\" which is one of the funniest Halloween radio episodes ever made."},
{"title": "Tales from the Darkside: \"Trick or Treat\" (The Pilot)", "date": "Sunday, October 29, 2023", "text": "Tale from the Darkside remains one of the best remembered horror anthologies of all time. Most episodes were morality plays or cautionary tales in which some individual or individuals got what was coming to them. Tales from the Darkside aired in syndication and proved to be rather popular in its time. It ultimately ran for four seasons. It was forty years ago today, on October 29 1983, that the show's pilot episode first aired. Fittingly enough given when it debuted, it was a Halloween tale called \"Trick or Treat.\"In \"Trick or Treat,\" Gideon Hackles (Barnard Hughes) is a local storekeeper and the richest man in town. Almost everyone in town and the surrounding rural area is in debt to him. He also happens to be an absolute miser and an absolutely spiteful one at that. Every Halloween he gives trick-or-treaters the chance to find their parents' IOUs. If an individual child finds their parents' IOU, their debts are entirely cancelled. Unfortunately, no child has ever found an IOU, as Mr. Hackles has his house rigged with animatronic ghosts and goblins of the sort one would find in a carnival fright house or a haunted house attraction with which he scares the kids away. As might be expected, in the end Mr. Hackles gets a rather Hellish comeuppance for his spitefulness and greed.Tales from the Darkside grew out of the movie Creepshow (1982), directed by George Romero and Stephen King. Creepshow was a portmanteau movie featuring four tales of horror, not unlike the British classic Dead of Night (1945) or such Amicus portmanteau horror movies as Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965) and The House That Dripped Blood (1970). Creepshow drew inspiration from such EC Comics horror titles as Tales from the Crypt and Vault of Horror, which also offered up morality plays in a horror setting. Creepshow proved moderately successful at the box office. It occurred to George Romero and the producers of Creepshow that the movie could provide the basis for a horror anthology television series. Unfortunately, Warner Bros.who distributed Creepshow, owned certain intellectual properties in relation to the movie. George Romero then created Tales from the Darkside. The comic book trappings of Creepshow were jettisoned for Tales from the Darkside, but like the movie it drew inspiration from EC Comics. As mentioned above, like EC Comics and Creepshow before it, Tales from the Darkside featured morality plays in which some character got their comeuppance. In this way the pilot episode, \"Trick or Treat,\" was truly representative of the series that was to come. Barnard Jones brought the greedy, spiteful, and downright sadistic Gideon Hackles to life, and made for a memorable episode. The episode's effects are also impressive for the era, when the use of CGI was virtually unknown. The fact that the debut of \"Trick or Treat\" coincided with Halloween and the pilot had a Halloween theme probably helped it draw in more viewers than it would have had otherwise. The success of \"Trick or Treat\" in syndication led Tribune Entertainment to go forward with Tales from the Darkside. The regular series debuted on September 30 1984 and ran for four seasons. The show's continued success would result in the theatrical release Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990), a portmanteau horror film featuring three tales of terror. It was released two years after Tales from the Darkside had ended its run.\"Trick or Treat\" would not be the only episode of Tales from the Darkside set at Halloween. The show's second Halloween episode, \"Halloween Candy,\" aired in its second season. In \"Halloween Candy,\" another grumpy old man gets his comeuppance when refusing to give a trick-or-treater candy. The third and final Halloween episode of Tales from the Darkside was \"The Cutty Black Sow,\" which dealt with a demon from Celtic lore that steals the souls of all who die on Halloween. Tales from the Darkside was released on VHS and later on DVD. Sadly, it is not available on streaming, but Tales from the Darkside is still remembered and maintains a cult following to this day. It was on the strength of that pilot, \"Trick or Treat,\" which would turn out to be one of the show's best episodes, that Tales from the Darkside came into being as a series."},
{"title": "\"Broom-Stick Bunny\" (1956)", "date": "Saturday, October 28, 2023", "text": "Among the best loved Warner Bros. animated cartoons is \"Broom-Stick Bunny,\" directed by Chuck Jones. It marks the second time that Bugs Bunny faced off against Witch Hazel, the first being \"Bewitched Bunny\" (1954). It is also one of the few Warner Bros. cartoons set at Halloween, and even involves the custom of trick or treating. For many fans of Warner Bros. animated theatrical shorts, it remains a favourite, particularly among those cartoons featuring Witch Hazel.\"Broom-Stick Bunny\" opens with Witch Hazel (June Foray) making a potion. She goes to her magical mirror and asks the mirror who is the ugliest of them all. The mirror (Mel Blanc) informs her that she is the ugliest of them all. This is a point of pride for Witch Hazel, as she worries that she will grow prettier as she gets older. This being Halloween, Bugs Bunny (Mel Blanc) is going trick or treating dressed in a witch costume, complete with a ugly green mask. Bugs goes to Witch Hazel's house and when she answers the door she remarks that \"she\"is the \"...ugliest little thing.\" This causes concern to Witch Hazel, who rushes to her mirror and asks again who is the ugliest of them all. The mirror informs her that she was the ugliest of them all, but adds that Bugs is far uglier. Witch Hazel then invites Bugs inside for tea, which she spikes with \"pretty pills\" so that she might regain her status as the ugliest one of them all. Bugs switches the teacups and then removes his mask to drink the tea. Unfortunately for Bugs, Witch Hazel realizes that the last ingredient she needs for her potion is a rabbit's clavicle. She then proceeds to chase Bugs before finally capturing him and tying him up. She is about to kill him with a meat cleaver when Bug's sad look reminds her of her late, lamented pet tarantula, Paul. She breaks down crying. Taking pity on Witch Hazel, Bugs gets free and then brings her one of the cups of tea to cheer her up. Unfortunately for Witch Hazel, it happens to be the tea spiked with pretty pills. Witch Hazel's worst fears then come true, as she is transformed into a beautiful, shapely redhead.Although she is the most famous character by that name, Warner Bros.' Witch Hazel was not the first animated character named \"Witch Hazel.\" A character named Witch Hazel also appeared in the 1952 Walt Disney animated short \"Trick or Treat.\" In fact, Disney's Witch Hazel was also voiced by June Foray. She was a very different character from Warner Bros.' Witch Hazel, even helping Huey, Dewey, and Louie get treats from their uncle Donald Duck. And while June Foray provided Warner Bros.' Witch Hazel with an American accent, she gave the Disney version a British accent. As to why Warner Bros. did not get into legal trouble with Disney over the name, the phrase\"witch hazel\" was already being used in commercial products well before \"Trick or Treat\" (1952), not to mention a character also called Witch Hazel was a recurring character the pages of Little Lulu before Disney's animated short.. Disney then had no real claim on the name. As mentioned above Warner Bros.' Witch Hazel originated in \"Bewitched Bunny\" (1954). It was directed by Chuck Jones, with a story by Michael Maltese. Long time Warner Bros. voice actor Bea Benaderet voiced Witch Hazel in that cartoon. As to June Foray, she had previously worked for Warner Bros., voicing Granny in the Sylvester and Tweety short \"Red Riding Hoodwinked\" (1955) and the Bugs Bunny short \"This is the Life?\" (1955).  She would go onto voice Granny for nearly sixty years.Both \"Red Riding Hoodwinked\" and \"This is the Life?\" were directed by Friz Freleng, so when June Foray's agent contacted her about working on another Warner Bros. short, she had no idea who Chuck Jones was. \"Broom-Stick Bunny\" was then the first time that Chuck Jones and June Foray ever worked together. While Mel Blanc was in the studio with June Foray when she recorded her part, she actually recorded her voice first as sometimes they would speed Mel Blanc's voice up. For most of the cartoon June Foray used her Witch Hazel voice, but when the tea spiked with pretty pills made Witch Hazel beautiful, she switched to her natural voice. In her commentary on \"Broom-Stick Bunny,\" June Foray stated her belief that Chuck Jones patterned the look of the now beautiful Witch Hazel on her, as the character wore her hair the same way and dressed as June Foray did at the time. Given June Foray was always attractive, it seems quite possible that Chuck Jones did use her as inspiration for the now beautiful Witch Hazel. Like Granny, June Foray voiced Witch Hazel for nearly sixty years.\"Broom-Stick Bunny\" was written by Tedd Pierce, who had already written several Warner Bros. animated shorts, as well as Fleischer Studios' feature film Gulliver's Travels (1939). Tedd Pierce not only served as a writer on animated cartoons, but also as a voice actor. He provided voices for various Fleischer shorts, as well as their feature films Gulliver's Travels and Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941), and several Warner Bros. cartoons as well. As mentioned above, \"Broom-Stick Bunny\" marked the first time June Foray and Chuck Jones worked together. They would work together many more times. Beyond the Warner Bros. animated shorts, they also worked on the Tom and Jerry shorts that Chuck Jones made for MGM. She would work on several animated specials directed by Chuck Jones, including the voice of Cindy Lou Who in The Grinch Who Stole Christmas!, as well as  voices for such specials as The Pogo Special Birthday Special, Horton Hears a Who!, The Cricket in Times Square, and The White Seal. They also worked together on the TV series Off to See the Wizard and the feature film The Phantom Tollbooth (1970).\"Broom-Stick Bunny\" was included in the 1977 television special Bugs Bunny's Howl-oween Special. It was released on VHS in 1984 collection The Looney Tunes Video Show and several more times on various Bugs Bunny collections. It was released on DVD in 2004 as part of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. It has been since included on several DVD collections, as well as on the Blu-Ray collection Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1. Currently it does not appear to be available on streaming (one would think it would be on Max).\"Broom-Stick Bunny\" was in many ways a historic animated cartoon. It marked the first time June Foray voiced Witch Hazel, and the first time she and Chuck Jones ever worked together. It marked the second appearance of Witch Hazel, thus further establishing her as one of the cast of Warner Bros. cartoon characters. It also remains a favourite of fans of Warner Bros. cartoons, particularly at Halloween."},
{"title": "Halloween Pranks", "date": "Friday, October 27, 2023", "text": "Pranks or \"tricks,\" if you prefer, have been a part of Halloween for centuries. The custom of pulling pranks on the holiday originated in Scotland, so that Scottish immigrants brought both the celebration of Halloween and the custom of Halloween pranks to the United States. And while Halloween pranks are less common than they once were in the 20th Century, they have never gone away completely.According to the book Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain by Ronald Hutton and other sources, playing pranks at Halloween dates from at least the 18th Century in the Scottish Highlands and Ireland. An early example of the association of pranks with Halloween can be see in the poem \"Halloween\" by Scottish poet John Mayne, who wrote in the poem, \"what fearful pranks ensue!\" When Scottish individuals migrated to the British Colonies and later the United States in the 18th and 19th Centuries, they brought the celebration of Halloween with them, including the custom of pulling pranks. Pulling pranks on Halloween is attested as early as 1862. An article in the November 1 1862 issue of The Inquirer of Lancaster, Pennsylvania mentions boys showering \"corn, gravel, and other such harmless missiles\" against people's windows. While the pranks described in The Inquirer were harmless, often times Halloween pranks could possibly be dangerous. According to the article \"Halloween Was Once So Dangerous That Some Cities Considered Banning It\" on History.Com, on October 31 1979 an engineer for the Louisville Short Line had to pull the brake on his train as it went through Newport, Kentucky due to what appeared to be a body lying on the tracks. It turned out to simply be a stuffed dummy placed there by 200 boys who were hiding along the tracks. While that particular prank could have proven dangerous to the passengers on the Louisville Short Line, other times pulling pranks could be dangerous to the pranksters themselves. The November 1 1893 issue of The Public Ledger of Maysville, Kentucky mentions an incident in which nightwatchman John Brewer at Ohio State University shot and seriously wounded one of a group of students who were in engaged in pulling pranks. A squad of police had to be sent to the scene. Fortunately, most Halloween pranks did not end in damage to property or people. According to the article \"When Halloween Was All Tricks and No Treats\" from October 27 2017 on Smithsonian Magazine's website, in 1894 two hundred boys in Washington, DC attacked people on streetcars with bangs of flour. Of course, the use of flour in Halloween pranks will be familiar to anyone who has read the novel Meet Me in St. Louis by Sally Benson or seen the 1944 movie based on the book. In Meet Me in Halloween, children throw flour on individuals, those individuals then being said to have been \"killed.\" Along with throwing flour on people, soaping windows was also a popular Halloween prank in the 20th Century. The November 1 1910 issue of the St. Joseph News-Press reported that not much vandalism occurred that Halloween, but two police officers patrolling Eighth and Fifth Streets noticed that every shop window for three blocks had been soaped. Among the many other pranks popular in the early 20th Century were ringing doorbells and then running away, removing street signs and placing them in other places, and turning over trash cans. Some Halloween pranks could involve some rather large, unexpected objects. My father grew up in the late Twenties and early Thirties and told me of some of the Halloween pranks pulled at the time. One time the boys took the local schoolmaster's wagon and managed to get it atop the schoolhouse. A popular prank in my father's crowd was also moving outhouses. The now popular custom of trick or treating appears to have grown out of the custom of pulling pranks. The first known use of the phrase \"trick or treat\" in print occurred in the November 4 1927 issue of the Herald (published in Lethbridge, Alberta) in an article on how youngsters in Blackie,Alberta were at back and front doors demanding, \"trick or treat.\" One can only guess that at some point some rather intelligent children in Canada realized they could use the threat of pranks or \"tricks\" as a means of getting candy or other treats. The custom apparently spread from Alberta to the United States by 1934, when it is mentioned in at least three different newspapers: the Oregon Journal, the Helena Independent, and the Chicago Tribune. Trick or treating would spread westward in the United States until it had reached the east coast in the late Thirties.While some newspapers of the Thirties had a tendency to approach trick or treating negatively, sometimes even describing it as a form of extortion, other newspapers treated the custom in a positive fashion. The reason was simply that with the arrival of the custom of trick or treating, the sort of vandalism seen on  previous Halloween nights declined. The November 1 1938 issue of The Reno Evening Gazette noted in an article on trick or treating that the Halloween of that year was \"... one of the quietest Halloweens on record.\"Trick or treating would not be the only reason for the decline in Halloween pranks. As the 20th Century progressed, particularly following World War II, Halloween parties held indoors became popular, giving youngsters something other to do than ring doorbells or soap windows. Both trick or treating and indoor Halloween parties may have seemed much more appealing to some youths than simply pulling pranks. Of course, pulling pranks on Halloween has never completely gone away. As a kid I remember the day after Halloween seeing soap covered store windows and even the occasional house and trees covered in toilet paper. Pranks are still being pulled to this day. Indeed, since the Nineties many pranks have been played online. Halloween pranks may not be a as popular as they once were, but they will continue to be a part of Halloween for years to come."},
{"title": "Disney's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\"", "date": "Thursday, October 26, 2023", "text": "Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, and even a few older Millennials may remember an animated adaptation of Washington Irving's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" that would sometimes air around Halloween on the Walt Disney anthology series (variously titled Disneyland, Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, The Wonderful World of Disney, and so on). Although many may remember it best for airing on its own on the Walt Disney anthology series, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" had originated as part of the package film The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949).The origins of The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad go back to 1940, when Walt Disney Productions began work on a planned feature film adaptation of Kenneth Grahame's novel The Wind in the Willows, initially titled The Magnificent Mr. Toad. Production on Disney's animated version of The Wind in the Willows would be halted and started back up numerous times. It was as early as 1943 that Walt Disney considered making The Wind in the Willows one half of a package film, with The Legend of Happy Valley (which evolved into the segment \"Mickey and the Beanstalk in the 1947 package film Fun and Fancy Free) or Road Dahl's original story The Gremlins. The Wind and the Willows would be shelved again in 1947.Like The Wind and the Willows, it was originally planned for \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" to be a feature film. Production on The Legend of Sleepy Hollow began early in 1947. By November 1947, it was decided to combine \"The Wind and the Willows\" and \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" into a package film to be called Two Fabulous Characters. It was finally titled The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad and released on October 5 1949.As to the source material, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" is a shot story written by Washington Irving and published in 1820 as part of his work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. It is set in 1790 around the Dutch settlement of Tarry Town, and a glen known as Sleepy Hollow. Sleepy Hollow is well known for its many legends of ghosts. Among these legends is that of the Headless Horseman, also known as the Galloping Hessian. The Horseman was a Hessian trooper whose head had been taken off by a cannonball during \"some nameless battle\" of the American Revolution. Ichabod Crane was a very superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut who settled in Tarry Town. He became rivals with local tough Abraham \"Brom Bones\" Van Brunt for the hand of Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter of a wealthy landowner. It was at the Van Tassel's harvest party that Brom and other locals filled Ichabod's head full of various ghost stories, including the one about the Headless Horseman. It was on the way home that Ichabod encounters the Headless Horseman, although it is heavily implied this is Brom rather than an actual ghost. Regardless, the following morning no trace is found of Ichabod Crane.Despite the title, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" actually follows \"The Wind in the Willows\" segment. \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" was narrated by Bing Crosby. It featured the voice of Pinto Colivg as Ichabod Crane and assorted townspeople. Pinto Colvig is familiar to Disney fans as the voices of Goofy and Pluto. Clarence Nash, famous as the voice of Donald Duck, provided the voice of Ichabod's horse. The laughter of the Headless Horseman was provided by Billy Bletcher, who had voiced Mickey Mouse's archenemy Pete and the Big Bad Wolf in the classic Disney short \"Three Little Pigs.\"  Beyond his work with Disney, he had appeared in Our Gang and Three Stooges shorts.Disney's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" is largely faithful to Washington Irving's original short story, although some changes were made. Perhaps the biggest change was in tone. Although it features some of Washington Irving's well-known humour, the original story is one of the earliest examples of American horror. Except for its climax, Disney's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" is altogether more light-hearted and whimsical. Among the other changes to the source material is the Van Tassels' party. In the original short story it is a \"harvest party.\" In Disney's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" it is a Halloween party. This is a bit of an anachronism, as Halloween really would not take hold in the United States until the 19th Century, brought over by Scottish immigrants. It would not have been celebrated in a Dutch settlement in New York in the 18th Century. Another change is in the nature of the Headless Horseman who pursues Ichabod Crane. In the short story it is hinted that the Horseman was actually Brom in disguise. In Disney's version, we are led to believe that the Headless Horseman is an actual ghost. Disney's version also omits the Headless Horseman's origin as a Hessian mercenary killed during the Revolutionary War.Like the \"Wind and the Willows\" segment before it, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" features songs (\"Ichabod Crane,\" \"Katrina,\" and \"The Headless Horseman.\"). The songs were written by Don Raye & Gene de Paul. The two songwriters wrote the hits \"Daddy-O, I'm Gonna Teach You Some Blues\" and \"I'll Remember April.\" The songs were performed by Bing Crosby & Jud Conlon's Rhythmaires.The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad was released on October 5 1949. The film received positive reviews from critics, although many of them displayed a preference for the \"Wind in the Willows\" segment to the \"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" segment. It has since remained highly regarded. The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad also did very well at the box office. It made $1,625,000 worldwide.While The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad was highly regarded by critics and did well at the box office, the two segments that comprised it would be separated in the Fifties. \"The Wind in the Willows\" aired on its own for the first time on February 2 1955 on Disneyland. The following season \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" first aired on Dsineyland, on October 26 1955. It was preceded by a fourteen minute animated biography of Washington Irving that would accompany it when it was repeated. \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" would air several more times around Halloween on the Walt Disney anthology series under its various titles. \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" was released theatrically as a stand-alone featurette on November 26 1958. It was released again in September 1963. The two segments having been separated, The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad would not be seen for many years. It was finally released on VHS in the UK in 1991 and in the US in 1992. It was released on DVD in 2002. The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad has been available on Disney+ ever since it launched in 2019. As to \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\" it would be released on VHS in 1982 and again in 1990 and 1994. While I must admit that I prefer the \"Wind and the Willows\" segment of The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, I have fond memories of watching the \"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" segment on The Wonderful World of Disney around Halloween as a kid. While it does depart from the original short story in some ways, it does have a charm all its own. And there is no Disney villain nearly as frightening as the Headless Horseman."},
{"title": "The 45th Anniversary of Halloween (1978)", "date": "Wednesday, October 25, 2023", "text": "It was 45 years ago, on October 25 1978, that John Carpenter's classic horror movie Halloween (1978) was released. Although regarded as a classic now, many critics at the time were dismissive of the film, with only a very few praising it. Audiences apparently did not agree with the critics, as the movie did well at the box office despite very little in the way of promotion. In the end it would prove to be one of the most influential horror movies of all time, sparking a host of imitators and a cycle of slasher movies that lasted into the Eighties.Of course, Halloween was not the first slasher movie. Both the Val Lewton film The Leopard Man (1943) and the Sherlock Holmes movie The Scarlet Claw (1944) can be considered forerunners of the genre. Peeping Tom  (1960) and Psycho (1960) would have a huge impact on the genre, and there are those who would classify both movies as outright slasher movies. Psycho would be followed by several imitators, including a entire series of psychological horror movies from Hammer (including 1961's Taste of Fear and 1963's Maniac) and William Castle's Strait-Jacket (1964). Also emerging in the Sixties were such giallo films as Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace (1964), which would also prove to be an influence on slasher movies. The Seventies would see the release of such outright slasher movies as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Black Christmas (1974). Black Christmas in particular can be considered a forerunner of Halloween (1978) in that it includes a holiday theme, young women being victimized, and even its own Final Girl (the last woman left alive in a slasher movie who confronts the killer in the end).For those unfamiliar with Halloween (1978), the movie centres on the return of Michael Myers to his home town of Haddonfield, Illinois. When he was only six years old Myers had stabbed his teenage sister to death. Escaping from custody on October 30 1978, he makes his way back to his home town, where he begins a killing spree. There is a lot more to the movie than that, but I really don't want to give it away for the few people who have never seen it.The origins of Halloween (1978) go back to its producer Irwin Yablans, who, after attending the Milan Film Festival, conceived the idea of a movie in which babysitters are terrorized by a killer. It was also Irwin Yablans who came up with the idea of the movie being set at Halloween. Irwin Yablans had seen Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), directed by John Carpenter, at the Milan Film Festival, and he thought Mr. Carpenter would be a good fit for his movie in which a psychopath is stalking babysitters. John Carpenter agreed to direct the movie only so long as he had complete creative control. Ultimately, he not only directed Halloween (1978), but he also scored the film and co-wrote the screenplay with his girlfriend of the time Debra Hill. For all of this he was paid $10,000.As to the screenplay, Debra Hill had been a babysitter when she was a teenager, and she wrote most of the female character's dialogue. John Carpenter handled much of the dialogue of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), Michael Myer's psychiatrist. Debra Hill had grown up in Haddonfield, New Jersey, so that name was used for the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois. Many of the street names in the movie were drawn from John Carpenter's home town of Bowling Green, Kentucky. For the backstory of Michael Myers, John Carpenter used the haunted house legends common to small towns. Much of the character of Michael Myers also came from a trip John Carpenter had made in college while in psychology classes to a mental institution, including a ward where the most disturbed patients were kept. Some of the names of the characters in Halloween (1978) were inspired by the cinema. Sheriff Leigh Brackett's name was taken from Leigh Brackett, the screenwriter of such classics as The Big Sleep (1946) and Rio Bravo (1959), and a science fiction author often known as \"the Queen of Space Opera.\" Both Dr. Loomis and Tommy Doyle's names came from Hitchcock movies, Dr. Loomis's name from the character of Sam Loomis (John Gavin) in Psycho and Tommy Doyle's name from Lt. Thomas J. Doyle (Wendell Corey) in Rear Window (1954).Although Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are now so firmly identified with their roles that it is hard picturing anyone else playing Laurie Strode and Dr. Loomis, the movie could have had a very different cast. Legendary horror actor Peter Cushing was approached about playing Dr. Loomis, but his agent turned the role down to the small salary. Peter Cushing's frequent co-star Christopher Lee was then approached for the role of Dr. Loomis, but he turned it down for fear that he would continue to be typecast in horror movie roles. It was producer Irwin Yablans who suggested Donald Pleasance for the role of Dr. Loomis. For the role of Laurie Strode, John Carpenter had wanted Anne Lockhart, the daughter of actress June Lockhart of Lassie and Lost in Space fame. It turned out that Anne Lockhart was unavailable due to prior commitments. John Carpenter also considered another unnamed actress who appeared in Jaws 2 (1978). That would likely be Ann Dusenberry, who is the same age as Anne Lockhart.  Ultimately, Jamie Lee Curtis, the daughter of Janet Leigh (who played Marion in Psycho) and Tony Curtis, was cast as Laurie. At that point in her career, Jamie Lee Curtis had appeared in guest appearances on television and had a regular role on the short-lived sitcom Operation Petticoat. Halloween (1978) marked her movie debut.The role of Anne Brackett, the daughter of Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) and Laurie's friend, was filled by Nancy Kyes, who had appeared in John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13.  P. J. Soles was cast as Lynda Van Der Klok, another one of Laurie's friends. P.J. Soles had already appeared in a classic horror movie, Brian De Palma's Carrie (1976), as well as various television appearances (including the TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble). She would later star in the cult film Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979).The budget for Halloween (1978) was extremely small for the era, only around $300,000. It also had a tight shooting schedule. It was filmed in 20 days. Halloween (1978) also had to be shot around Donald Pleasance's busy schedule. That the movie was shot in the spring of 1978 complicated matters. Pumpkins were hard to come by, and artificial fall leaves had to be used in multiple scenes. Because the budget was so low, many of the actors wore their own clothes. The entire wardrobe for Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie was purchased at J.C. Penney for about $100. Props in the movie had to be bought inexpensively or often made by hand. Even Michael Myers's famous mask cost very little. Two masks were bought. One was an Emmet Kelly mask from Don Post. It was decided that it was not frightening enough. The mask ultimately used in the movie was one of Captain James T. Kirk from Star Trek, bought on Hollywood Boulevard for $1.98. Production designer Tommy Lee Wallace widened the eye holes on the mask and painted it a bluish white. As a low-budget, independent feature, Halloween (1978) was shot on location around Los Angeles County. Locations were chosen for their resemblance to small, Midwestern towns and as few palm trees as possible (although a few do creep into some frames). Much of the film was shot in a small Los Angeles County town I won't mention due to personal reasons (my long-time readers know which town I am talking about and why I won't mention it), including Lynda's house (on Montrose Avenue), Michael Myer's home (on Mission Street), the hardware store (The Frame Shop on Mission Street), Laurie's house (on Oxley Street), and various other places around town. Other scenes were shot in other locations around Los Angeles County. The Smith's Grove Sanitarium was actually La Vina Respiratory Hospital in Altadena, California. The Wallace's home and the Doyle's home were both on Orange Grove Avenue in Hollywood. The cemetery in Halloween (1978) is Sierra Madre Pioneer Cemetery. The elementary school in Haddonfield was actually Garfield Elementary in Alhambra. Yet other scenes were shot in City of Industry, Rosemead, Burbank, and Pasadena. Halloween (1978) premiered on October 24 1978 at the AMC Empire Theatre in Kansas City, Missouri. It was released the following day, on October 25 1978. As mentioned above, while Halloween (1978) is now regarded as a classic, many critics at the time were dismissive of the film. Pauline Kael in The New Yorker was particularly hard on the film, stating in her review, \"...the style is reminiscent of the Halloween episode in Minnelli’s Meet Me in St. Louis. But Carpenter isn’t very gifted with actors, and he doesn’t seem to have any feeling at all for motivation or for plot logic. Halloween has a pitiful, amateurish script (by Carpenter and his producer, Debra Hill).\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post also gave the movie a negative review, writing, \"Since there is precious little character or plot development to pass the time between stalking sequences, one tends to wish the killer would get on with it.\" Lou Cedrone in The Baltimore Evening Sun referred to Halloween (1978) as being \"tediously familiar.\"Halloween (1978) did receive its share of positive reviews. Gene Siskel of The Chicago Tribune called it, \"a beautifully made thriller.\" His fellow Chicago critic, Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times, also gave it a positive review, stating, \"Halloween is a visceral experience--we aren't seeing the movie, we're having it happen to us. It's frightening. Maybe you don't like movies that are really scary: Then don't see this one.\" Tom Allen in The Village Voice also praised Halloween (1978), opening his review with \"It’s useless to take a lofty view on an instant schlock horror classic, but there are reasons why John Carpenter’s Halloween, alone in the last decade, stands with George A. Romero’s Night of the Living Dead and, before that, with Psycho, in which Hitchcock subverted the subgenre to different ends.\" Since the initial release of the film, time has proven those critics who gave Halloween (1978) positive reviews right. It is considered a classic and currently boasts a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. As mentioned in the opening of this post, while some critics were dismissive of Halloween (1978), audiences embraced the film. As an independent, low-budget film it had little in the way of a promotional budget, so that it primarily relied on word of mouth to draw audiences into theatres. Despite this, it ultimately made $70 million worldwide. This made it the most profitable independent film for its time. It was because of the success of Halloween (1978) that NBC paid about $3 million for the television rights to the film. John Carpenter and NBC's Broadcast Standards fought about various cuts to the film, and as Halloween (1978) was only 91 minutes, an additional twelve minutes were filmed by Mr .Carpenter for the network broadcast. Halloween  (1978) made its television debut on NBC on October 30 1981.Of course, the success of Halloween (1978) meant that there would be sequels. The first of these, Halloween II (1981), was released on October 30 1981 and takes place almost immediately following the events of Halloween (1978). Halloween II would not repeat the success of the first movie, although it did respectably well at the box office. With the third sequel, Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982). John Carpenter and Debra Hill returned as producers, but only on the condition that the movie would not be a direct sequel to Halloween (1978). John Carpenter and Debra Hill reconceived the Halloween series as a series of stand-alone movies in which each film centred around the holiday of Halloween. Halloween III: Season of the Witch is then the only Halloween movie in which Michael Myers does not appear. Unfortunately, Halloween III: Season of the Witch not only received negative reviews, but did not perform as well as expected at the box office. It has since become a cult film.Given the box office disappointment of Halloween III: Season of the Witch, the next film would be a direct sequel to Halloween (1978), Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988). It would be followed by Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989) and Halloween 5: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995). The next movie, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), ignored all of the movies following Halloween II and was Jamie Lee Curtis's first Halloween movie since Halloween 4. It was followed by a sequel, Halloween Resurrection (2002).It was in 2007 that a \"reimagining\" of Halloween (1978), Halloween (2007), directed by Rob Zombie, was released. It was followed by a sequel, Halloween II (2009). The two films directed by Rob Zombie would be followed by Halloween (2018). Despite its title, Halloween (2018) was not a remake of Halloween (1978), but instead a direct sequel to the film, ignoring all the previous sequels (including 1981's Halloween II). It has been followed by the sequels Halloween Kills (2021) and Halloween Ends (2022). All three films star Jamie Lee Curtis as an older Laurie Strode.Halloween (1978) would prove to be one of the most influential horror movies of all time. It spawned a cycle of slasher movies that lasted from the late Seventies into the Eighties. It was followed by a slough of slasher movies, such as Friday the 13th (1980), Prom Night (1980), Graduation Day (1981), and My Bloody Valentine (1981), often centred around a holiday or special event. Most of these slasher films would be more graphic and featured more gore than Halloween (1978), which featured almost no graphic violence. Unfortunately, with but a few exceptions, the slasher films following Halloween (1978) were often poorly made and followed a strict formula. Halloween (1978) would even have an influence on horror movies outside the slasher genre. Although often counted as a slasher movie, given Freddy Krueger is essentially a ghost who can manipulates dreams, Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is better counted as a supernatural horror movie that was heavily influenced by Halloween (1978). The same can be said of Candyman (1992). Ultimately, there are probably very few horror movies in the last forty years, whether they are slasher movies or not, that have not been influenced by Halloween (1978) in some way, shape, or form.Another way in which Halloween (1978) would prove influential is the fact that it was the most successful independent film of its time. This opened the doors for other independent films, whether they were horror movies or not. The movie Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) would prove that not only could independent movies be financially successful, but they could receive a good deal of acclaim as well. Low-budget, independent movies would find more opportunities for wide releases, through such venues as Focus Features, Fox Spotlight, Miramax, Savoy Pictures, and Sony Pictures Classics. Halloween (1978) was also pivotal in the career of John Carpenter. While he had gained notice with his second film, Assault on Precinct 13, it was Halloween (1978) that would put John Carpenter on the map. He would go onto direct such films as Escape from New York (1981), The Thing (1982), Christine (1983), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), and They Live (1988). He is now counted as one of the greatest horror directors of all time. It also launched the career of Jamie Lee Curtis. She would go onto appear in such movies as Trading Places (1983), A Fish Called Wanda (1988), True Lies (1994), and  Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022), among other films. Dismissed by some critics upon its original release,  Halloween (1978) is now regarded as a classic and often makes lists of the greatest horror movies of all time. It launched the cycle of slasher movies that lasted into the Eighties, and its influence is still being felt to this day. Few films, let alone horror movies, have had the impact that Halloween (1978) had."},
{"title": "The Andy Griffith Show: \"The Haunted House\"", "date": "Tuesday, October 24, 2023", "text": "Among the favourite episodes of The Andy Griffith Show is the fourth season episode \"The Haunted House.\" The episode is often counted as the only Halloween episode of The Andy Griffith Show, although the episode is not set around the holiday nor is Halloween ever mentioned. Even so, the episode first aired on October 7 1963, making it quite possible that \"The Haunted House\" was meant to capitalize on Halloween. In \"The Haunted House\" Sheriff Andy Taylor's (Andy Griffith) son Opie (Ronnie Howard) and his friend Arnold (Ronnie Dapo) are playing with a baseball when it goes through the window of the deserted Rimshaw House on the edge of Mayberry. The boys are reticent to retrieve their ball as the old Rimshaw House is reputed to be haunted. When Opie tells Andy about the incident, Deputy Barney Fife (Don Knotts) argues that Andy should have made the boys retrieve the ball, even though he is hesitant when Andy makes the suggestion that Barney gets the ball for the boys. It is then that Andy, Barney, and gas station attendant Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors) go to the Rimshaw House to get the ball. As it turns out Barney and Gomer are even more superstitious than Opie and Arnold, a situation made all the worse by strange sounds, a painting with eyes that seems to watch one's every move, and other strange goings on. Of course, while Barney and Gomer think the old Rimshaw House could be haunted, Andy suspects there is a rational explanation for everything.It should come as no surprise that The Andy Griffith Show would feature a \"haunted house\" episode, as haunted houses have a long history on stage, in film,  and television going back to the play The Cat and the Canary. Prior to The Andy Griffith Show, Leave It to Beaver, Dennis the Menace, My Three Sons, and The Donna Reed Show had all done \"haunted house\" episodes. The Dick Van Dyke Show did one the same season as The Andy Griffith Show, \"The Ghost of a A. Chantz,\" which aired only a few days before \"The Haunted House,\" on September 30 1963.\"The Haunted House\" was written by Harvey Bullock, who had written for such shows as Top Cat, The Real McCoys, and Make Room for Daddy. He had been writing for The Andy Griffith Show since the second season, and had already written several episodes of the show before \"The Haunted House,\" including \"Mr. McBeevee,\" \"Andy's English Valet,\" and \"The Big House.\" \"The Haunted House\" marked the first episode ever directed by Earl Belllamy, who would go onto direct several more episodes of the show. He had directed many episodes of The Lone Ranger, Tales of Wells Fargo, and Bachelor Father, among other shows.Of course, among the stars of \"The Haunted House' was the old Rimshaw House itself, which was located on the Desilu backlot where The Andy Griffith Show was filmed. It was in 1957 that Desilu had bought RKO's production facilities, which included RKO Forty Acres, the Hollywood studio's rather extensive backlot. Among the many films shot, at least in part, at RKO Forty Acres was Gone with the Wind (1939). The Rimshaw House in \"The Haunted House\" was Aunt Pittypat's House in Gone with the Wind and appeared in several other RKO movies. Although portrayed as being on the edge of Mayberry in \"The Haunted House,\" \"the Rimshaw House\" was actually located not far from Andy Taylor's house on the lot. On The Andy Griffith Show it also served as the home of Mayor Stoner (Parley Bear), Clara Edwards (Hope Summers), and Mayberry's pastor called both Reverend Tucker and Reverend Martin ( (William Keene).Aside from being considered by many to be the only Halloween episode of The Andy Griffith Show, \"The Haunted House\" is also notable for inspiring a movie. It was at the end of the fifth season that Don Knotts left the show to pursue a movie career. He signed a contract with Universal Pictures to make five films. It should not be surprising that Don Knotts's first movie under his contract to Universal was largely patterned after Mayberry. Indeed, it seems obvious that The Ghost and Mr. Chicken could have been inspired by \"The Haunted House.\" In The Ghost and Mr. Chicken Don Knotts played a typesetter, Luther Heggs, for the Rachel Courier Express in the small town of Rachel City, Kansas. After making a report of a murder near the old Simmons Mansion, reputed to be haunted, that turns out to be nothing more the town crunk being knocked out by his wife, he is mocked by people around town. Ultimately, Luther finds himself assigned by his editor to spend the night at the Simmons Mansion, which Luther initially thinks to be haunted. Of course, as in \"The Haunted House,\" there is a rational explanation for everything. The small town of Rachel City is a small town much like Mayberry, filled with eccentric characters. What is more, some of those characters are played by veterans of The Andy Griffith Show, including Hal Smith, Hope Summers, and Burt Muslin.  Furthermore, The Ghost and Mr. Chicken was written by two veteran writers of The Andy Griffith Show, Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum. The pair wrote some of the best known episodes of The Andy Griffith Show, including \"The Bank Job,\" \"Man in a Hurry,\" and \"Citizen's Arrest.\" Everett Greenbaum's voice can even be heard in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken every time someone shouts, \"Attaboy, Luther!.\" The movie was directed by Alan Rafkin, who had directed several episodes of The Andy Griffith Show. \"The Haunted House\" remains one of the favourite episodes of The Andy Griffith Show. Much of this is due to the fact that the entire cast is in top form, from Andy Griffith to Don Knotts to Jim Nabors to Hal Smith. The script by Harvey Bullock is also excellent, and like any good horror comedy contains some genuine scares. Whether it was meant to be a Halloween episode is perhaps besides the point. It is perfect viewing for the holiday."},
{"title": "The 100th Anniversary of Disney Part Two", "date": "Saturday, October 21, 2023", "text": "Founded in 1923 as the Disney Brothers Studio, Walt Disney Productions established itself as one of the top producers of theatrical cartoons and the foremost producer of animated features. In 1950 the studio broke into live-action feature film production with Treasure Island (1950). It was only four years later that the studio would expand into television as well.Walt Disney wanted to produce a television show that would help finance his planned amusement park, Disneyland. His proposal was rejected by both CBS and NBC, and so Walt Disney turned to ABC, then struggling to survive against the two older, established networks. He signed with ABC on March 29 1954, and the TV show Disneyland debuted on the network on October 27 1954. As originally conceived, Disneyland was an anthology series with themes based on what would be the four main parts of Walt Disney's planned amusement park: Adventureland, Fantasyland, Frontierland, and Tomorrowland. The episodes of the show were then eclectic, everything from classic Disney cartoons to documentaries to scripted adventure mini-series such as Davy Crockett. As might be expected, the show featured teasers for the planned amusement park Disneyland. Disneyland proved to have a hit on its hand with the mini-series Davy Crockett, which first aired on Disneyland on December 15 1954. Davy Crockett became an outright fad in 1955. Ultimately, Disneyland itself proved to be a hit, coming in at no. 6 for the year in the Nielsen ratings.The success of Disneyland led ABC to pick up two more shows from Walt Disney Productions. The Mickey Mouse Club in 1955 and Zorro in 1957. As to Disneyland itself, it was retitled Walt Disney Presents in 1958. ABC and Walt Disney would have a falling out, in part because the network refused to sell its stake in the amusement park Disneyland and would not do so until 1960. Another problem between ABC and Walt Disney is that he wanted the show to air in colour, and ABC was not anywhere near to moving towards colour broadcasting. Walt Disney's anthology series then moved to NBC, who already had facilities for colour and had already broadcast various programs in colour. The show was then retitled Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color and first aired on NBC on September 24 1961. It would remain on NBC for 19 years, with its title changing in 1969 to The Wonderful World of Disney and then again to Disney's Wonderful World in 1979. In 1981 it moved to CBS where it aired two more years. Since then the show has returned from time to time under different titles, and still airs from time to time on ABC. It was in 1996 that Disney bought ABC and has owned it ever since.As to Walt Disney's amusement park, Disneyland, he first conceived it after visiting Griffith Park in Los Angeles with his daughters and watching them ride the merry-go-round there. Initially called Disneylandia, Walt Disney finally settled on the name Disneyland. His brother Roy had some doubts about Disneyland, and so Walt Disney founded a separate company for the amusement park, originally called Walt Disney Enterprise and then W.E.D. Enterprises. It was in 1953 that Walt Disney bought 160 acres near Anaheim, California where the park would be located. Disneyland opened on July 17 1955. While the opening day did not go particularly well, with rides malfunctioning and the restaurants running out of food, Disneyland would soon be running properly and proved to be a success. It success would lead to the opening of a second resort, Walt Disney World, in Florida in 1971. Since then several more Walt Disney theme parks have opened around the world. The mid-Fifties would prove to be an active time for Walt Disney Productions. Until that time, the studio had been dependent on others to distribute their films, with Columbia distributing their animated theatrical shorts in the early days, United Artists in the mid-Thirties, and RKO for much of the Golden Age of Animation. In 1953 RKO showed little enthusiasm for Walt Disney Productions' feature length nature documentary The Living Desert, and so the two studios entered into a dispute. Ultimately, Walt and Roy Disney formed their own subsidiary of Walt Disney Productions to handle distribution. It was named Buena Vista Film Distribution Company Inc. after the street in Burbank where the Disney studio was and still is located. The Walt Disney Company would discontinue the use of Buena Vista in its branding in 2007.The Sixties saw Walt Disney Productions expand into new film genres. In 1961 they released their first live-action musical, Babes in Toyland, which failed both with critics and at the box office. While Babes in Toyland proved to be a failure, their next live-action musical, Mary Poppins, proved to be a roaring success. Released in 1964, it received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. What is more, it was nominated for several Academy Awards and won the Oscars for Best Actress for Julie Andrews, Best Film Editing for Cotton Warburton, Best Music Score – Substantially Original for the Sherman Brothers, and Best Special Visual Effects. It also proved to be a hit at the box office, becoming the top grossing film in the United States in 1964. It was also during the Sixties that Walt Disney Productions released several successful comedies, including The Parent Trap (1961) and That Darn Cat! (1965).Unfortunately, after seeing a good deal of success in the Fifties and Sixties, Disney began to falter in the Seventies. By the early Eighties, the majority of the studio's profits actually came from its theme parks rather than its movies and films. With the studio in decline, Disney began to shake up the sort of films they released. The science fiction movie The Black Hole (1979) would be the first PG-rated movie the studio ever released. In 1982 Disney released Tron (1982), one of the first movies to make extensive use of computer-generated imagery.With Disney's fortunes continuing to decline and many thinking of the studio as releasing primarily children's fare, it was in 1984 that the subsidiary Touchstone Pictures would be founded. Touchstone Films was meant to release movies directed at primarily adult audiences and with more mature themes. It was renamed Touchstone Pictures in 1986, the same year it released its first R-rated film, Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986). Touchstone also produced television series under the name Touchstone Television, staring with the TV series Wildside in 1984. Touchstone Television would see a good deal of success with The Golden Girls. Home Improvement, and other shows. Although Touchstone Pictures still exists, Touchstone Television would be renamed ABC Television Studio in 2007 and Disney would move away from releasing films under the Touchstone banner and releasing them under Walt Disney Pictures instead.Touchstone would not be the only subsidiary established by Disney in the Eighties to release more adult fare. Hollywood Pictures was formed in 1989 to release films similar to Touchstone, although the the films released under Hollywood Pictures had even more mature themes than those released under Touchstone. Among the movies released by Hollywood Pictures were Arachnophobia (1990), Encino Man (1992), Blood In Blood Out (1993), Father Hood (1993), The Joy Luck Club (1993), and Quiz Show (1994). While Touchstone saw a good deal of success, Hollywood Pictures saw only a little. In 2001 Hollywood Pictures was phased out. The name would be revived briefly in 2006 for low-budget movies.It was in 1986 that Walt Disney Productions was renamed the Walt Disney Company, the name it has borne ever since. It would be in 1991 that the Walt Disney Company entered into a feature film agreement with Pixar. Pixar had originated as The Graphics Group at Lucasfilm. Pixar became an independent company in 1986. It was in 1995 that Pixar's first feature film was released, Toy Story (1995). The entirely computer animated film proved to be a success, and established Pixar as a studio. Since then Pixar has released several hit movies. It was in 2006 that the Walt Disney Company bought Pixar and so the studio became a subsidiary of Disney. Despite this Pixar has retained something of its independence, with its movies released under the \"Pixar\" label.Of course, Pixar would not be the only company acquired by Disney. In 2004 Disney acquired the Muppets franchise from the Jim Henson Company. In 2009 Disney acquired Marvel Comics. In 2012 Disney bought Lucasfilm, a move which has proven controversial given some Star Wars fans' doubts about the company's stewardship of the franchise. It was in 2019 that Disney acquired 20th Century Fox, a move that would prove controversial among classic movie buffs who have accused Disney of vaulting classic 20th Century Fox movies. It was in 2005 that Disney released it first entirely computer animated movie, Chicken Little (2005) under the Disney brand, ten years after Pixar's Toy Story. Chicken Little would receive largely negative reviews from critics, although it performed moderately well at the box office. It was in 2009 that the Walt Disney Company released its last traditional cel animated feature film, much to the disappointment of fans of cel animation.The Princess and the Frog (2009) received good notices from critics. While it did moderately well at the box office, it still performed below expectations. Disney's disappointment at the box office performance of The Princess and the Frog at the box office would lead the studio to rename its upcoming, computer animated film Rapunzel, \"Tangled,\" to distance the film from the princes concept. The 21s Century has seen Disney expand into new areas. In 2019, when Disney acquired 20th Century Fox, it also acquired a 60% stake in the streaming service Hulu. It was that May that Comcast relinquished its stake in Hulu to Disney, making the streaming service entirely owned by the studio. It was later that year that the Walt Disney Company launched the streaming service Disney+. The difference between Hulu and Disney+ is that Disney+ primarily features films and TV shows produced by Walt Disney Studios, while Hulu includes products from other companies as well.One hundred years after being founded by Walt and Roy Disney, the Walt Disney Company has become a juggernaut in the entertainment industry. They have gone from being an independent animation studio to be an independent studio that produced both animation and live action, and finally one of the major studios. There can be no doubt that Disney had left its imprint on popular culture. Many of the characters that originated in their theatrical animated shorts, from Mickey Mouse to Chip & Dale, remain popular. Disney comic books from the Golden Age and Silver Age are highly sought after collectibles. Disney has highly successful theme parks around the world. Merchandise featuring the Disney characters, from Donald Duck to the Disney Princesses, still fill store shelves. In 1923 the Disney Brothers Studio was one of several animation studios. Today the Walt Disney Company is so much more."},
{"title": "The 100th Anniversary of Disney Part One", "date": "Friday, October 20, 2023", "text": "It was on October 16 1923 that Walt and Roy Disney founded the Disney Brothers Studio, later known as Walt Disney Studios, Walt Disney Productions, and, currently, the Walt Disney Company. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, Walt Disney Studios was one of the top producers of animated shorts and the top producer of animated features. They would expand into production of live action features and television in the Fifties. From their beginnings 100 years ago, the Walt Disney Company has gone from an independent studio dedicated to animation to one of the major studios in the American film industry.The origins of the Walt Disney Company go back to Laugh-O-Gram Studio, founded on June 28 1921 by Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks. Walt Disney had been contracted by Milton Feld, the manager of the local theatre chain, Newman's Theatres, to create a series of animated shorts to be called \"Newman's Laugh-O-Grams.\" In addition to Ub Iwerks, Laugh-O-Gram would employ other soon-to-be legendary animators, including Firz Freleng, Hugh Harman, and Ruby Isling. Unfortunately, Newman's Theaters declared bankruptcy only a few months into their deal with Walt Disney. It was after they had completed some of the editing on the short \"Alice's Wonderland\" that Laugh-O-Gram itself was forced to declare bankruptcy. Walt Disney moved to Los Angeles to live with his uncle Robert and his brother Roy, taking the incomplete \"Alice's Wonderland\" with him. \"Alice in Wonderland\" starred Virginia Davis in the title role and was notable for combining live-action with animation. In Los Angeles, Walt Disney showed \"Alice's Wonderland\" around and eventually he was able to get a contract to produce an entire series of \"Alice Comedies.\" The short \"Alice's Day at Sea\" would become the first animated short to originate at Disney Brothers Studio. They would continue to produce the \"Alice Comedies\" from 1924 to 1928. It was in 1927 that Charles Mintz approached Walt Disney about producing a series of animated shorts for Universal Pictures. It was then that Walt Disney Studio (the Disney Brothers Studio having been renamed in 1926) created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Oswald proved to be very popular, so that in 1928 Walt Disney asked for a larger fee for his films. Unfortunately, Universal Pictures owned the rights to the character, and Charles Mintz simply hired away four of Walt Disney's animators to make the films. Of course, this left Walt Disney Studio without a character to star in their cartoons. It was while the Walt Disney Studio was producing their last Oswald the Lucky Rabbit shorts that Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks conceived a new character. They came up with a character called \"Mortimer Mouse,\" but Walt Disney's wife Lillian convinced him to change the name. Mortimer Mouse then became Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse made his debut in the short \"Plane Crazy,\" on May 15 1928. The character failed to make an impression with audiences in the short. A second short starring Mickey Mouse, \"The Gallopin' Gaucho,\" was completed, but was not released until sound was added it to it later. \"Steamboat Willie' was the third Mickey Mouse cartoon to be produced and the second to be released. \"Steamboat Willie\" differed from the first two Mickey Mouse cartoons in that it was produced with sound, making it one of the earliest cartoon talkies to ever be produced. \"Steamboat Willie\" proved to be a hit and Mickey Mouse's popularity soon approached that of Felix the Cat, the top animated character of the time. By the early Thirties Mickey Mouse was the most popular star of animated shorts. Walt Disney Studio would follow Mickey Mouse with other popular animated characters. Donald Duck first appeared in the short \"The Wise Little Hen\" in 1931. Donald Duck would also prove to be very successful, so that by the mid-Forties he became more popular than Mickey Mouse himself. It was in the 1932 short that Walt Disney Productions introduced a character named \"Dippy Dog.\" He would have a larger role in the 1932 Mickey Mouse short \"The Whoopee Party.\" It was with the 1934 short \"Orphan's Benefit\" that he was renamed \"Goofy.\" He would graduate to his own cartoon series in 1939 with \"\"Goofy and Wilbur.\"It was following the success of \"Steamboat Willie\" that Walt Disney launched a new series of shorts that generally did not feature continuing characters. The \"Silly Symphonies\" combined animation with pieces of music. The series would be notable in its use of the multiplane motion picture camera, as well as Technicolor. The success of the \"Silly Symphonies\" would lead other studios to adopt similar names for their series of animated cartoons, for instance Warner Bros.' \"Merrie Melodies\" and \"Looney Tunes.\"It was in 1929 that Walt Disney Studio was incorporated as \"Walt Disney Productions.\" The change in name was perhaps fitting given it would enter into the production of its first feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in 1934. When Walt Disney announced the project, it was met with such scepticism that it was often called \"Disney's Folly.\" As it was, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs proved costly to produce, with a budget that eventually grew to $1,488,422.74. It also took some time to produce. With production beginning in 1934, it was not completed until 1937. Premiering at the the Carthay Circle Theatre in Hollywood on 21 December 1937, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs proved its sceptics wrong. Not only did the film receive largely positive reviews, it became the highest grossing film of all-time until surpassed by Gone with the Wind (1939).In its early days Walt Disney Productions was a pioneer in movie merchandising. Following the incorporation of the studio Walt Disney Productions, on December 16 1929 a division to handle merchandising, Walt Disney Enterprises, was created. A \"Mickey Mouse\" newspaper comic strip debuted on January 13 1930. That same year there would be a Mickey Mouse doll.  By 1934 there would be  Mickey Mouse watches manufactured by Ingersoll Watch Company. Mickey Mouse was not the only character merchandised by Disney in its early days. The 1933 \"Silly Symphony\" short \"Three Little Pigs\" would also be merchandised, with a book, figurines, a game, and so on. As might be expected, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was also heavily merchandised. There was a newspaper comic strip adaptation of the film, a soundtrack album (making it one of the first films to have a soundtrack album), radios, banks, books, dolls, games, and much more. Among the Disney merchandise produced in the Thirties were Halloween costumes based on Disney characters manufactured by F. S. Fishbach, Inc., which would be bought out by Ben Cooper in 1937.With their 1941 feature film The Reluctant Dragon, Walt Disney Productions made history. It was their first feature film to incorporate live-action. The Reluctant Dragon would make a modest profit, but unfortunately this would not be the case for some of Disney's animated feature films in the early Forties. While Pinocchio (1940) received positive reviews and won the Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song, it performed poorly at the box office. The same would be true of Fantasia (1940) and Bambi (1942). To make matters worse, it was in 1941 that 300 of Walt Disney Productions' animators went on strike for five weeks, demanding unionization and higher wages. Sadly, Walt Disney would fire many of the strikers. Ultimately, Federal mediators urged the studio to recognize the Screen Cartoonists Guild. The strike would cost Walt Disney Productions dearly. Several animators left the studio, so that in the end they were left with only 694 employees.During World War II Walt Disney Productions produced propaganda films in order to rally Americans to support the war. The Forties would also see Walt Disney Productions produce a number of package films, films that would feature two or more animated films. The first of these was Saludos Amigos (1943), which had been commissioned by the United States Department of State as part of the Good Neighbour Policy, a policy began by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to promote goodwill towards Latin America. Saludos Amigos would be followed by several more package films, the last of which would be The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad in 1949.It was in 1948 that Walt Disney Productions began producing a series of live-action, education shorts called \"True-Life Adventures.\" The shorts focused on nature, with entries on seals, bears, elk, and lions. The series would be produced until 1960. \"True-Life Adventures\" would lead to the 1953 feature film The Living Desert, the first feature-length nature documentary produced by Walt Disney Productions. The year 1950 would prove to be historic for Walt Disney Productions. Early in the year saw the release of Cinderella (1950), the studio's first animated feature film that was not a package film in eight years. It proved to be Disney's biggest financial success since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and also received positive reviews from critics as well. It was later in the year that Treasure Island (1950) was released. Treasure Island was Disney's first completely live-action feature film. It proved to be a success at the box office, so that Walt Disney Productions has continued to produce live-action movies ever since.It was also in 1950 that Walt Disney Productions would have their first exposure on television. The television special One Hour in Wonderland was produced by Disney to promote their upcoming feature Alice in Wonderland (1951). Walt Disney hosted the special, with  appearances by Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Bobby Driscoll, Kathryn Beaumont (the voice of Alice in the feature film), and others. One Hour in Wonderland was aired on NBC on December 25 1950. It would only be in a few years that viewers would be exposed to Disney every week. A company that had originated as an animated studio would soon expand into television and beyond."},
{"title": "The Late Great Dwight Twilley", "date": "Thursday, October 19, 2023", "text": "Power pop Dwight Twilley died yesterday, October 18 2023, at the age of 72. On Saturday he had a stroke while driving and his car crashed into a tree. He died four days later in the hospital. Dwight Twilley was best known for his hits \"I'm On Fire\" and \"Girls.\"Dwight Twilley was born on June 6 1951 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He had taken an interest in music while young and was an Elvis Presley, but it was seeing The Beatles' appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show that led him to pursue music as a career. While still in junior high he formed his first band, The Intruders. It was at a screening of The Beatles' movie A Hard Day's Night (1964), that he met future collaborator Phil Seymor. They formed a band called Oisler, splitting the duties of lead vocals between them. In 1969 they left Tulsa for Memphis, Tennessee. They returned to Tulsa and then in late 1974 the band Oisler went to Los Angeles. They signed with Shelter Records, who insisted they change their name to the Dwight Twilley Band. It in one night at Church Studio that the Dwight Twilley Band recorded their hit \"I'm On Fire.\" It was released in April 1975. \"I'm on Fire\" proved to be a hit, going to no. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single was followed by the Dwight Twilley Band's first album, Sincerely. Unfortunately, the Dwight Twilley Band was not able to capitalize on the momentum from \"I'm on Fire.\" Dwight Twilley and Phil Seymour both sang on the debut album of fellow Shelter artists Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. Their second album, Twilley Don't Mind, was released in September 1977. While it reached no. 70 on the Billboard album chart, none of their singles charted. The Dwight Twilley Band split up only a few months after the release of Twilley Don't Mind.Dwight Twilley became a solo artist and his first album as such, Twilley, was released in 1979. Dwight Twilley's second album as a solo artist, Blueprint, was rejected by Arista Records. As a result, his next album would not be released until 1982. Scuba Divers performed better than Twilley, reaching no 109 on the Billboard album chart. Jungle, released in 1984, produced Dwight Twilley's second hit single. \"Girls\" reached no. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. The second single from the album, \"A Little Bit of Love,\" reached no. 77 on the chart.Unfortunately, Dwight Twilley would not see the success on the chart that he had with  Jungle again. He left EMI America for Private I Records, for whom he recorded his next album Wild Dogs. The album failed to chart. His next album, The Luck, would remain unreleased for several years. In fact, his album Tulsa would be released before it was, in 1999. The Luck was finally released in 2001. His final album, Always, was released in 2014 and featured Ken Stringfellow of The Posies and Mitch Easter, known as the front man of Let's Active and a producer for R.E.M.Dwight Twilley was a true pioneer in power pop. The Dwight Twilley Band's single \"I'm on Fire\" hit at a time when only a few power pop artists (Badfinger, The Raspberries) had charted before. They would pave the way for other power pop acts, including Cheap Trick, The Knack, and The Romantics. He would influence such acts as The Posies and Matthew Sweet. Dwight Twilley's music was archetypal power pop. It was characterized by Beatlesque harmonies and clear, crisp guitars. It is sad that while Dwight Twilley was often a darling of the critics, for the most part he rarely saw success on the charts. Among the innovators of power pop, his music really deserves to be heard."},
{"title": "The Late Great Keith Giffen", "date": "Wednesday, October 18, 2023", "text": "Keith Giffen, the comic book artist and writer who created Ambush Bug, Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes), Lobo, and Rocket Raccoon, died on October 9 2023 at the age of 70. The cause was a stroke. Much of his career was spent with DC Comics, where he had long runs on the titles Justice League and Legion of Super-Heroes.Keith Giffen was born on November 20 1952 in Queens, New York. He was first published in Marvel Premiere no. 4 (January 1976). In the Seventies, at Marvel, he also worked on such titles as Amazing Adventures, Deadly Hands of Kung Fu, The Defenders, Iron Man, and Super-Villain Team-Up. With Bill Mantlo he created Rocket Raccoon, who made his first appearance in Marvel Preview no. 7 (summer 1976). Mr. Giffen would do later work at Marvel on such titles as Annihilation, Beast, Captain Marvel, Daredevil, Excalibur, Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics Presents, Marvel Westerns, Micronauts, Nick Fury's Howling Commandos, and Spectacular Spider-Man. His first work for DC Comics was also in 1976, on All-Star Comics no. 60 (June 1976). In the Seventies he also worked on the DC titles Challengers of the Unknown, Claw the Unconquered, Kamandi, and Kobra. It was in 1982 that he began work on Legion of Super-Heroes. He would continue working on titles featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes into the Nineties. His run on Justice League began in 1987 and would last until 1992. He would work on various Justice League titles on and off into the Naughts. In 1982 he created the character of Ambush Bug, who first appeared in DC Presents no. 52 (December 1982). Lobo, an interplanetary bounty hunter and mercenary, first appeared in Omega Men no. 3 (June 1983). The character eventually received his own title. In the Eighties Keith Giffen also worked on the DC Comics titles Action Comics, Amethyst. Aquaman, Blue Devil, Cosmic Boy, DC Comics Presents, The Flash, Ghosts,.House of Mystery, Mister Miracle, Omega Men, The Unexpected, Weird War Tales, and Wonder Woman.In the Nineties Keith Giffen did work on such DC titles as Demon, Eclipso, Ragman, and Starman. He continued work on Justice League and Legion of Super-Heroes titles. It was in the mid-Naughts that the character of Jaime Reyes, the third Blue Beetle, was introduced in Infinite Crisis (February 2006). The character would go onto appear in his own ongoing series and this year headlined his own theatrical feature film. In the Naughts, Keith Giffen also worked as the layout artist on the limited series 52 and such DC titles as Ambush Bug: Year None, Doom Patrol, Green Arrow, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Looney Tunes, and Suicide Squad. In the Teens he worked on such titles as Green Arrow and O.M.A.C.Keith Giffen also did work for Image Comics on the titles Badrock & Company, Bloodstrike, Freak Force, Phantom Force, SuperPatriot, and Trencher.

Keith Giffen also worked in animation. He was a writer on such series as The Real Ghostbusters; Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi; and Ed, Edd n Eddy. He served as a storyboard artist on Spider-Man Unlimited; Batman Beyond; and Static Shock. Keith Giffen proved to be a pivotal creator in the history of comic books. The late Eighties into the Nineties saw comic books take on a darker tone. It was a period with anti-heroes such as The Punisher, Spawn, and Wolverine became extremely popular. While other comic book creators were making their titles darker and darker, Keith Giffen brought fun back to comic books. He was well known for his sardonic, often subversive sense of humour, and he was not below taking down even well-known, beloved characters such as Batman. Indeed, many of the characters created or co-created by him were purposefully humorous. The initial idea for Ambush Bug was \"Bugs Bunny as a super-villain.\" Lobo was a parody of the ultraviolent anti-heroes of the era. On top of being a talented writer and plotter, Keith Giffen was also a fine artist. His style was generally slick and clean, but he could vary it to fit nearly any genre, from superhero to horror to humour. Keith Giffen was a man of multiple talents, and he brought all of them to bear in his work."},

In 2000 he had been diagnosed with stage II breast cancer.Suzanne Somers was born Suzanne Mahoney on October 16 1946 in San Bruno, California. She performed in plays in high school and graduated from Capuchino High School in San Bruno, California. She attended Lone Mountain College in San Francisco, but dropped out when she learned she was pregnant. She married the father of the child, Bruce Somers. They divorced in 1968.Suzanne Somers made her film debut in a bit part in Bullitt in 1968. She also appeared as an extra in the movies Daddy's Gone A-Hunting (1969) and Fools (1970). She was a model on the syndicated show Anniversary Game, which ran from 1969 to 1970. She appeared as the blonde in the Thunderbird in American Graffiti (1973) and that same year in Magnum Force (1973). In the Seventies she guest starred on the shows Lotsa Luck!, The Rockford Files, One Day at a Time, The Love Boat, Starsky and Hutch, The Six Million Dollar Man, Billy, and The Ropers. She was cast as Chrissy Snow on the TV show Three's Company following an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. The show proved to be a hit in the Nielsen ratings. It was with the show's fifth season that Suzanne Somers demanded to be paid as much as men on similar, but lower rated series. She missed two episodes, and ABC eventually fired her. In the Eighties Suzanne Somers starred on the syndicated sitcom She's the Sheriff for two seasons. She appeared in the mini-series Hollywood Wives. In the Nineties she starred on the sitcom Step by Step. She guest starred on the shows Sisters, The Larry Saunders Show, Full House, The Naked Truth, and The Simpsons.

Her last appearance in a feature film was in Say It Isn't So (2001). In 2012 she hosted The Suzanne Show on the cable channel Lifetime.Chances are very good that Suzanne Somers will be best remembered as Chrissy Snow on Three's Company. While Chrissy had many of the characteristics of the dumb blonde stereotype, Suzanne Somers made the character sympathetic and even convincing within the reality of Three's Company. She also did fine on Step by Step as widowed mother Carol Foster Lambert, who married a divorced father (Patrick Duffy). The role was a far cry from Chrissy Snow, particularly given Carol was a beautician who operated her own business. Of course, she'll always be remembered as the blonde in the T-Bird in American Graffiti as well. While it was a bit part, with her facial expressions and body language she brought the character to life and made her appealing. With two hit series and an appearance in a classic film, Suzanne Somers won't soon be forgotten."},

Those fortunate enough to have met her describe her as sweet and personable. If Dark Shadows fans loved her so, it was not simply because she kept the legacy of the show alive for years. It is because she was a true lady."},

{"title": "Tony Martinez: More Than Pepino", "date": "Saturday, October 14, 2023", "text": "Today Tony Martinez is best known for playing farmhand Pepino on The Real McCoys, but his career went well beyond that sitcom. He was also a talented musician, who played five instruments. He not only played clubs in New York City, Los Angeles, and elsewhere, but he also released singles and albums. As to his acting career, he appeared in classic movies and guest starred on classic TV shows.Tony Martinez was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico on January 27 1920. It was in 1942 that he moved to New York City. There he studied music at Julliard. He was the bassist for pianist Noro Morales's band, while at the same time being educated in music by Juan Tizol, a trombonist in Duke Ellington's orchestra. It was about this time, in 1943, that he met the legendary Tito Puente at the Stork Club.It was in 1945 that Tony Martinez moved from New York City to Hollywood. There he became a conguero with the Dezi Arnaz Orchestra. By the early Fifties Tony Martinez would go out on his own. As the leader of the Tony Martinez Quintet, he released several singles, starting with \"Hollywood Mambo\" in 1954. The Tony Martinez Quintet would continue releasing singles throughout much of the Fifties. In 1959 Tony Martino released the album The Many Sides of Pepino (as mentioned above, Pepino was his character on The Real McCoys). As Tony Martino & his Orchestra, he released the single \"The Black Sheep\" and in 1960 an album with Eddie Cano & Jack Costanzo, Dancing on the Sunset Strip.Of course, today Tony Martinez is best known as an actor, and even trained at the Pasadena Playhouse. He made his film debut in a bit part as a bellboy in Angel on the Amazon in 1948. In 1950 he appeared in the film Barricade and the Mexican film El ciclón del Caribe. It was the year 1952 that would see the most significant role of his career so far. He played Go-Go, a friend of the protagonist Tommy in the movie The Ring (1952). The Ring is significant in being one of the first movies centred on Chicanos and one of the first to portray the racism they faced in 1950s Los Angeles. It also featured Rita Moreno in her first lead role. Tony Martinez would follow The Ring with an uncredited appearance in Second Chance (1953) and the role of Vicente in the Western The Naked Dawn (1955). He also made guest appearances on the TV shows The Colgate Comedy Hour and The Lone Wolf. It was in 1956 that he made his most significant appearance in a film besides The Ring, although it was primarily as a musician. He appeared as himself in the rock 'n' roll musical Rock Around the Clock (1956). There Tony Martinez and His Band performing several songs, including \"Mambo Capri,\" \"Solo Y Triste,\" and \"Bacalao Con Papa.\" If a band performing mambo appearing in a rock 'n' roll musical sounds odd, keep in mind that from the late Forties into the early Fifties there was a mambo craze in the United States, and as late as 1956 mambo was still seen as a rival to rock 'n' roll. Not only did this craze provide a boost to Tony Martinez's career, but also the careers of  Machito, Noro Morales, Tito Puente, Tito Rodriguez, and others.Following Rock Around the Clock, Tony Martinez appeared in an uncredited role as a filling station attendant in You Can't Run Away from It (1956). Tony Martinez and his band were playing at a club on the Sunset Strip when he was noticed by television producers Irving and Norman Pincus. It was then that he was cast as Mexican farmhand Pepino Garcia on the sitcom The Real McCoys. Pepino was something of a stereotype, and he even took the surname \"McCoy\" when he became a United States citizen. Even so, Pepino was one of the few Latino characters on American television in the Fifties, perhaps the only others of any significance being Ricky on I Love Lucy and later Hey Soos on Rawhide. Tony Martinez would get a chance to perform two songs on The Real McCoys. In the October 27 1960 episode \"Pepino McCoy\" he performed the songs \"Cuanto La Gusta\" and \"Pepino.\" Both songs had been included on Tony Martinez's 1959 album, The Many Sides of Pepino. While Tony Martinez's acting career slowed after The Real McCoys, and consisted of guest appearances on television shows. He guest starred on the shows The Man From U.N.C.L.E., F Troop, My Favorite Martian, Accidental Family, and Storefront Lawyers.  In 1967 he joined the national company of the play The Man from La Mancha. He would go onto play Sancho Panza in over 2,245 performances of the play, including on Broadway. In the Seventies he would write music for a few Mexican movies. He was also the executive director of Artists Variety Co. in Puerto Rico, a government sponsored program to help people break into entertainment. In the early Eighties he served as executive director of the Institute of Motion Pictures, the government film commission in Puerto Rico.Tony Martinez died on September 16 2002 at the age of 82.While Pepino on The Real McCoys was something of a stereotype, as mentioned above, he was one of the few Latino characters on American television in the Fifties and hence something of a pioneering character. Beyond playing Pepino on The Real McCoys, Tony Martinez also had a role in The Ring, a groundbreaking film in that it focused on Chicanos. As a musician he had a successful career that included performing at many clubs, releasing several records, appearing in the movie Rock Around the Clock, and writing music for Mexican films. Chances are good Tony Martinez will always be best remembered as Pepino, but he did so much more."},

After they divorced in 1986, she appeared in the 1989 TV movie Kiss Shot and the 1991 TV movie Mrs. Lambert Remembers Love. She appeared in the films Goodnight, Sweet Marilyn (1989) and Hollywood: The Movie (1996). She guest starred on the shows Midnight Caller and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. She also guest starred in the 1994 Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman episode \"The House of Luthor,\" playing Ellen Lane, the mother of Lois Lane.Phyllis Coates spent much of her time in B-movies and on television, but she was a remarkable actress nonetheless. On Adventures of Superman she played Lois Lane as a determined reporter, who was always out to scoop Clark Kent with regards to stories. As Alice in the \"Joe McDoakes\" shorts, she was Joe's intelligent, competent, and attractive wife who always got the better of him. In the cult classic I Was a Teenage Frankenstein, she played Margaret, Professor Frankenstein's secretary, who realizes that what her boss is doing isn't exactly ethical. In the Tales of Wells Fargo episode \"Alias Jim Hardie,\" Phyllis Coates played a role quite different from Alice and Lois. She played Pat Denton, a clerk who tries to help an outlaw impersonating Wells Fargo agent Jim Hardie rob a Wells Fargo office. In the Perry Mason episode \"The Case of the Black-Eyed Blonde,\" she played a character even further from Alice and Lois. She played Norma Carter, a woman who not only committed murder, but plotted to sell the murder victim's son to someone else. Phyllis Coates may always be remembered as Lois Lane, but she played a wide variety of roles in her career, many of them quite different from any other role she played."},

{"title": "The 65th Anniversary of 77 Sunset Strip", "date": "Tuesday, October 10, 2023", "text": "It was 65 years ago today that the detective television series 77 Sunset Strip debuted on ABC. The show originally centred on Stuart Bailey (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.), a former secret agent for the OSS during World War II and foreign languages professor, and attorney Jeff Spencer (Roger Smith), who operate a detective agency out of fashionable offices in Suites 101 and 102 at 77 Sunset Strip. Suzanne Fabray (Jacqueline Beer), a French switchboard operator for the Sunset Answering Service, handled many of Bailey & Spencer's calls and sometimes got involved in cases. Kookie (Edd Byrnes) was a parking attendant at Dino's Lodge (Dean Martin's real-life lounge). He also became involved in cases and was later made a detective in the agency. Racetrack tout Roscoe (Louis Quinn) often hung out at the Bailey & Spencer offices and sometimes even did some work for the detectives. The contact at the Los Angeles Police Department on which they most frequently relied was Lieutenant Roy Gilmore (Byron Keith).The origins of 77 Sunset Strip go back to the 1946 novel The Double Take by Roy Huggins, who would go onto create such shows as Maverick, The Fugitive, and The Rockford Files. The Double Take differed a bit from 77 Sunset Strip. For one thing, in Double Take Stuart Bailey has no partner. For another thing, Stu Bailey in The Double Take is not nearly as sophisticated, nor as hip, as Stu Bailey on 77 Sunset Strip. The Double Take would be adapted with a script by Roy Huggins himself as the 1948 film I Love Trouble, starring Franchot Tone as Stuart Bailey. Roy Huggins wrote no more novels featuring Stuart Bailey, although the detective did appear in the short stories \"Now You See It\" (1946), \"Appointment with Fear\" (1946), and \"Death and the Skylark\" (1952).By the Fifties Roy Huggins was a producer for Warner Bros. While there he served as producer on the shows Cheyenne (the first hour-long Western) and Conflict. He created and produced the classic Western TV series Maverick and created the Western Colt .45. Given Warner Bros.' Western TV shows had proven successful, it occurred to him that an hour-long detective show could also prove successful. Roy Huggins then drew upon his novel The Double Take and his Stuart Bailey short stories to create 77 Sunset Strip. It was William T. Orr, then head of Warner Bros. Television, who suggested to Roy Huggins that they could expand the initial story that Roy Huggins had written for 77 Sunset Strip and expand it into a ninety-minute movie in case they could not sell it as a television series. Marion Hargrove, who was writing the script for the initial 77 Sunset Strip episode, \"Girl on the Run,\" then expanded the script for a ninety-minute movie also titled Girl on the Run. The movie was shot in ten days and, according to Roy Huggins in an Archive of American Television interview, was shown for a week at a theatre in the Caribbean. Warner Bros. Television then showed Girl on the Run to ABC, who picked up 77 Sunset Strip as a series. Unfortunately, the production of the theatrical film Girl on the Run allowed Warner Bros. to claim 77 Sunset  Strip was based on the movie and as a result cheat Roy Huggins out of both a creator credit and his royalties. This despite the fact that it was inspired by Roy Huggins's novel The Double Take and the Stuart Bailey short stories, and used a story by him that had been adapted by writer Marion Hargrove as a screenplay.Girl on the Run would be shown as the first episode of 77 Sunset Strip, even though it differed somewhat from the regular series. Of the show's regular characters, only Stuart Bailey (played by Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) and Suzanne (played by Jacqueline Beer) appear in the movie. Edd Byrnes does appear in the film, but he plays a very different character from Kookie. Instead he played a violent killer named Kenneth Smiley who is constantly combing his hair. Edd Byrnes made such an impression on younger viewers that ABC wanted Mr. Byrnes added to the cast of regulars on 77 Sunset Strip. He was then added to the cast as Gerald Lloyd \"Kookie\" Kookson III .Roy Huggins had originally intended for 77 Sunset Strip to be a grim and gritty detective show, close in spirit to his novel The Double Take. The 23rd episode of the show's first season would see 77 Sunset Strip gradually take on a lighter tone. That episode, \"The Pasadena Caper,\" also marked the first of several episodes in which the word \"caper\" was used in the title. Originally very much in the tradition of hard-boiled detective stories, 77 Sunset Strip developed an often self-deprecating sense of humour. It was also during the first season that Kookie grew in popularity, proving to be the show's breakout character. As time passed, Kookie played a larger and larger role on the show. Actor Edd Byrnes realized the importance of the popularity of Kookie to 77 Sunset Strip, and during the second season Kookie was absent from 16 episodes as he held out for money money and a bigger role on the show. He eventually returned to the show later in the second season. 77 Sunset Strip proved to be a hit for ABC, particularly with younger views. Dell and later Gold Key produced several issues of a 77 Sunset Strip comic book. Bell, Lowell Toy Mfg. produced a 77 Sunset Strip board game. The three short stories featuring Stuart Bailey were compiled into a novel by Roy Huggins and published under the title 77 Sunset Strip as a paperback by Dell. Perhaps the most famous bit of promotion for 77 Sunset Strip was the novelty song \"Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)\" by Edward Byrnes and Connie Stevens. Released in March 1959, it reached no. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. As to Connie Stevens, she was no stranger to Warner Bros. detective shows. She ultimately made four guest appearances on 77 Sunset Strip and played photographer Cricket Blake on Hawaiian Eye.The success of 77 Sunset Strip would lead to the show essentially being \"cloned\" by Warner Bros. as yet other detective shows that were set in exotic locales; featured young, handsome detectives; and an attractive female regular. The 1959-1960 season saw the debut of Hawaiian Eye (set in Honolulu) and Bourbon Street Beat (set in New Orleans). The 1960-1961 season saw the debut of Surfside 6, set in Miami Beach. Many times scripts for 77 Sunset Strip episodes would be rewritten for these various shows. Like Warner Bros.' Western shows before them, 77 Sunset Strip and its clones were set in a shared universe, so that characters from one show might appear on episodes of another show. For example, two of Connie Stevens's guest appearances on 77 Sunset Strip were as Cricket Blake on Hawaiian Eye. It is also possible that the shared universe of the Warner Bros. detective shows was the same as the shared universe of the Warner Bros. Westerns. In the Maverick episode \"Hadley's Hunters\" Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) encounters a stable hand played by Edd Byrnes at a stable called \"77 Sunset Strip.\" While the stable hand could not possibly be Kookie (not unless he had found the fountain of youth), he could well be Kookie's grandfather or great grandfather.77 Sunset Strip would see some cast changes throughout its run. Richard Long had played detective Rex Randolph on the TV show Bourbon Street Beat. When that show was cancelled, Richard Long joined the cast of 77 Sunset Strip, moving into Suite 104 at 77 Sunset Strip as part of Stuart Bailey and Jeff Spencer's detective agency for the show's third season. Rex Randolph would be gone by the fourth season of 77 Sunset Strip, and Kookie was finally promoted to a full-fledged detective, taking over Suite 104. Robert Logan was cast as the new parking attendant, J. R. Hale. If anything, 77 Sunset Strip  proved to be even more popular in its second season. It ranked no. 6 in the Nielsen ratings for the year. For its third season it ranked no. 13 in the Nielsen ratings for the season. By its fourth season it had dropped to no. 30 for the year. The fifth season would see 77 Sunset Strip no longer ranking in the top thirty in the Nielsens for the year. It was with the show's ratings declining that 77 Sunset Strip was entirely revamped. Jack Webb was brought in as executive producer and William Conrad was brought in as a producer and director. An even greater change is that the entire cast, except for Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Stuart Bailey, was dismissed. Furthermore, no explanation was given for the absence of Jeff Spencer, Kookie, and the other regular characters. For all extents and purposes, Stuart Bailey was a different character. His past with the OSS was never mentioned and he was an overall more dour character.  Stuart Bailey's office was different as well, even though the address was still \"77 Sunset Strip.\" Even the tone of the show was now darker. For all extents and purposes, 77 Sunset Strip was now an entirely different show in which the lead character had the same name and was still played by the same actor.Long-time fans of 77 Sunset Strip apparently did not appreciate the changes to the show. Ratings for 77 Sunset Strip dropped and the show ended its run in February 7 1964 after only twenty episodes. While 77 Sunset Strip was gone, it was hardly forgotten. It proved successful as a syndicated rerun. It would later air on TV Land  and MeTV. There had been an plaque in the sidewalk at 8524 Sunset Boulevard, between La Cienega Boulevard and Alta Loma Road, in honour of the show (I don't know if it is still there or not).  Prior to the launch of The WB, there was a proposed revival of 77 Sunset Strip that would air on the new network. A 25 minute presentation film was even shot for the spring 1995 upfronts, but nothing ever came of it.77 Sunset Strip would be a historic show. Years before Law & Order, CSI, NCIS, and Chicago Fire/Chicago PD/Chicago Med, it pioneered the concept of shows and spinoffs set in the same reality. Along with Richard Diamond, Private Detective and Peter Gunn, it sparked a cycle towards detective show on American television that would last into the early Sixties. Perhaps most importantly, along with Cheyenne and Maverick, it was one of the early successes for Warner Bros. Television, which would go onto produce such shows as F Troop, The Streets of San Francisco, Night Court, and ER."},
{"title": "The 70th Anniversary of the TV Show Topper", "date": "Monday, October 9, 2023", "text": "Topper and the KerbysIt was seventy years ago today, on October 9 1953, that the TV sitcom Topper debuted on CBS. Topper was based on Thorne Smith's 1925 novel of the same name and its sequel Topper Takes a Trip (1932), as well as the movies inspired by the novels: Topper (1937), Topper Takes a Trip (1938), and Topper Returns (1941). Topper starred Leo G. Carroll as uptight banker Cosmo Topper, who finds himself haunted by two ghosts, the fun-loving wife and husband Marion and George Kerby (played by real life husband and wife Anne Jeffreys and Robert Sterling). In the TV series there was an additional ghost  that was not in the novel or the movies, a St. Bernard named Neil. Like the novels and the movies before them, episodes of the TV show featured the Kerbys trying to liven up the somewhat stuffy Topper's life. Topper did very well in the ratings, ranking no. 24 for the year in the Nielsen ratings for its second season. Despite this, it ended its run after only two seasons because CBS could not find a sponsor for the show after Camel cigarettes had dropped out. While it only lasted two seasons, it would do well as a rerun in syndication. Much of this may have been because Topper was the first fantasy sitcom, and so was unique for its era. As such it would have an impact, even if it was not felt right away. After the success of My Favorite Martian in 1963, American airwaves would be filled with sitcoms about an ordinary human being living with such unusual characters as a witch, a robot, an angel, a car that was the reincarnation of his mother, a genie, and so on. If it had not been for the initial success of Topper and its subsequent success as a syndicated rerun, we might not have My Favorite Martian, Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie, and the many other fantasy sitcoms that have aired ever since.In 2014 I wrote a detailed post on the history of Topper, so I won't repeat myself here. You can read my original post on the TV series Topper here."},
{"title": "Why I Don't Complain About Noir Alley", "date": "Saturday, October 7, 2023", "text": "On October 1, Eddie Muller made a post to his Facebook page addressing complaints about a few \"duds\" airing on Noir Alley in September. I won't quote Mr. Muller's entire post here, as I feel as if readers can always visit his Facebook page to do so, but in part he wrote, \"...I show a wide range of films within the elastic category 'Noir' because my personal taste does not dictate what I show--many viewers express enjoyment, even affection, for movies I don't find 'great.' But as a host, I'm not going to tell you something is 'fantastic' or 'legendary' or even 'good' if I don't actually believe it. My opinion doesn't discount the film, or the fact that someone else might think it's sensational.\" As someone who has watched Noir Alley from the very beginning and only missed a few editions of the programming block, I can understand what Mr. Muller is saying in his post.Indeed, I am a bit puzzled by people complaining about \"duds\" being shown on Noir Alley in September 2023. On September 2, The Secret Fury (1950) was shown. Now I am not sure that I would say that The Secret Fury is outright noir, but it is definitely a psychological thriller with noirish elements. It was shot by cinematographer Leo Tover, who was also the cinematographer on such noirs as The Woman on the Beach (1947) and Dead Reckoning (1947), as well as the sci-fi classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). On September 9, The Wrong Man (1956) was shown on Noir Alley. This film is an Alfred Hitchcock classic and about as close to Noir as Hitch ever came beyond Shadow of a Doubt (1943). I definitely would not consider it a \"dud.\" On September 16 we were shown Out of the Fog (1941). Now I would consider Out of the Fog more proto-noir than pure Noir, but it benefits from a good plot and solid performances from John Garfield, Ida Lupino, and Eddie Albert. It also boasts great cinematography from the Master himself, James Wong Howe. Mr. Howe would be no stranger to Noir, shooting such films as Nora Prentiss (1947), Body and Soul (1947), and Sweet Smell of Success (1957). Perhaps the only movie I could see anyone rightfully calling a dud was Whiplash (1948), which aired on September 30. Now in my modest opinion (and apparently many others as well), Whiplash is not a good film. The plot seems cobbled together from other, better movies, and at times seems convoluted. There is a bit of miscasting in the form of Zachary Scott, who we are led to believe was in an occupation that no one would expect any of Mr. Scott's characters (or Mr. Scott himself) to ever be in. Even so, Whiplash has Eve Arden giving a great performance to make it worth watching. Anyway, as I see it, there was only one dud that aired on Noir Alley in September, and even it had some redeeming qualities.Anyway, Eddie said of Noir Alley in his post, \"It's a once-a-week affair, and it's a crap shoot as to what's coming next: big budget A picture? Poverty Row quickie? Foreign language classic? It's like life ... you can't be too sure about what's around the corner ... but we try to make it as entertaining and edifying as possible.\" And I think that is one of the most wonderful things about Noir Alley. One never knows what to expect in any given edition of the programming block. Will it be a classic like Out of the Past (1947)? Or will it be z-grade dreck like Wicked Woman (1953)? This sets Noir Alley apart from many movie anthologies that have aired in the past. Not every film that airs on Noir Alley is necessarily a classic or even a good movie, but I enjoy seeing all of them. Indeed, it can be almost as fun heckling a film like Wicked Woman as it is marvelling at a classic like Out of the Past.Of course, another advantage in Noir Alley showing bad films as well as classics is that one actually gets the whole scope of the Film Noir movement. If only classics produced by the major studios were shown on Noir Alley, I think one would fail to grasp the sheer breadth of the movement.  It did not just include great films produced by the major studios, but also good films produced by the smaller studios, such as Suspense (1946) from Monogram. It also included bad films from the major studios, such as the aforementioned Whiplash, as well as bad films from the smaller studios, such as Fear (1946) from Monogram. . Aside from the wide variety of films shown on Noir Alley giving people a better idea of the sheer breadth of the Film Noir movement, I do think it is good for movie lovers to watch bad movies from time to time. Quite simply, I think by watching movies that are poorly made one develops a better appreciation for great films. Indeed, by examining what makes a particular movie \"bad,\" one can also figure out why truly great films are, well, great. Quite simply, watching a movie like Wicked Woman makes one appreciate a movie like Out of the Past all the more.Of course, here I must also point out that what is a \"dud\" for one person may be a truly great film for others. Eddie Muller states in his post that \"many viewers express enjoyment, even affection, for movies I don't find 'great.'\" I know that I have found myself at odds with my fellow film noir fans from time to time with regards to a particular movie. A perfect example of this for me is the movie Detour (1945). I have seen many, many people refer to it as a classic. I even know people who consider it among those film noirs one must absolutely see. As many readers of this blog already know, I do not consider Detour to be a good movie, let alone a classic. Does that mean other film noir fans are wrong? Does it mean I am wrong? The answer to both questions is, \"No.\" Whether one considers a movie good or not is highly subjective.  The old aphorism \"One man's trash is another man's treasure\" is all too true. I am sure that there are those film noirs I consider exceptional that others might consider just plain bad. I certainly won't pretend to like every single film aired on Noir Alley. There have been films I have thoroughly disliked. There have been films I thorough enjoyed, but that I don't necessarily consider Noir. That having been said, I am not about to say none of them should have been shown on Noir Alley or that Eddie Muller is somehow dropping the ball in curating Noir Alley. I appreciate the wide variety of movies programmed on Noir Alley, from the greatest of classics to worst of the worst. Indeed, I think my appreciation of film noir as a movement is all the better for having watch the wide array of movies aired on Noir Alley."},
{"title": "¿Qué Pasa, USA?", "date": "Friday, October 6, 2023", "text": "Prior to the Seventies, Cubans and Cuban Americans were a rarity on American television. Perhaps the only Cuban character of any importance on a television show was Ricky Ricardo, played by Desi Arnaz, on the classic sitcom I Love Lucy. That would change in 1977 with the debut of ¿Qué Pasa, USA? on PBS.  ¿Qué Pasa, USA? was a sitcom centred on the  Peña family, a family of Cuban Americans living in Little Havana in Miami. T Pepe Peña (Manolo Villaverde) was the father and male head of the family. Juana (Ana Margarita Martínez-Casado) was the mother and female head of the family. Antonio (Luis Oquendo) was Juana's father, who spoke primarily Spanish and spoke English very poorly, so he often had to rely on Pepe and Juana as a translators. Adela (Velia Martinez), was Juana's mother, who was also primarily fluent in Spanish and had to rely on her children as translators. Joe (Steven Bauer) was Pepe and Juana's son. Carmen (Ana Margo) was Pepe and Juana's daughter. The primary followed the Peñas as they were torn between traditional Cuban values and the pressures of living in a primarily Anglo-American society.  ¿Qué Pasa, USA? was not only historic as the first American sitcom based around a Cuban American family, but also as the first bilingual sitcom. Given the grandparents did not speak English, it was not unusual for episodes of the show to switch between Spanish and English. It was also the first sitcom produced exclusively for PBS.The origins of ¿Qué Pasa, USA? go back to the Emergency School Aid Act of 1972, which essentially a Federal incentive program to encourage schools to desegregate. It was Senator Walter Mondale who introduced legislation that would create a program under the Emergency School Aid Act that would create educational television programming that would help children of diverse racial backgrounds connect with each other. The program came to be called ESAA-TV.  It was ESAA-TV that would lead Manny Mendoza, a professor at Miami-Dade Community College, to create a show centred around a Cuban American family. Professor Mendoza had conducted studies for the Community Action and Research Group in Miami that indicated Cuban American teenagers were often isolated. He thought that an educational program that was also entertaining could alleviate this problem. Professor Mendoza and his partner Julio Avello, along with Miami PBS station WPBT-2, then co-wrote a proposal for what would become ¿Qué Pasa, USA?. Professor Mendoza and WPBT-2 then secured Federal funding under ESAA-TV to go forward with the show. He approached Jose Bahamonde to serve as executive producer on the show. The budget for ¿Qué Pasa, USA? was miniscule compared to that of broadcast network sitcoms of the time. The first two seasons, with about ten episodes each, were budgeted at only $250,000 apiece. According to Jose Bahamonde, because of the low budget, he actually decorated the set with his own personal items and things he had bought at thrift stores. The limited budget would also have another impact on ¿Qué Pasa, USA?. At a time when shows on the commercial networks produced around 24 episodes per season, ¿Qué Pasa, USA? produced around 10 episodes per season. Produced in Miami on a low budget, ¿Qué Pasa, USA? did not have access to actors well-known in the United States at the time. Velia Martinez, who played Abuela Adela, had a career going back to the Forties, having appeared in such Mexican films as El capitán Malacara (1945) and Loco y vagabundo (1946), and American films such as The Big Boodle (1957). Like Velia Martinez, Luis G. Oquendo, who played Abuelo Antonio, had appeared in Mexican films. Perhaps the member of the cast best known today is Steven Bauer, who played Joe. For the show he was billed under the name \"Rocky Echevarria,\" and it was under that name that he guest stared on a 1978 episode of The Rockford Files. Steven Bauer left the show after its third season to pursue a Hollywood career. Joe was written off the show as having left to attend Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Steven Bauer would go onto star in the final season of Wiseguy and would he would have recurring roles on such shows as Hacienda Heights, Ray Donovan, and Queen of the South.¿Qué Pasa, USA? was created to be broadcast on local stations in the Miami and Tampa areas. In the end, the show proved to be popular, so that it would be broadcast on 70 PBS stations throughout the United States. It ultimately reached 20 million viewers. Not only did audiences love ¿Qué Pasa, USA?, but it was also well received by critics. Despite its popularity, ¿Qué Pasa, USA? ended after four seasons and 39 episodes when its funding ran out.¿Qué Pasa, USA? was not gone, however, as it has continued to be rerun to this day. In 2018 the continued popularity of the show would result in a stage  production titled ¿Qué Pasa, USA? Today...40 Years Older, which reunited some of the original cast members. ¿Qué Pasa, USA? would have a lasting impact beyond having launched Steven Bauer's career. It has never left the air and it is currently available on both YouTube and Vix. ¿Qué Pasa, USA? was the first real exposure Cuban Americans had on American television, and in the years since Cuban Americans have been more visible on American television. At a time when Cuban Americans were invisible on American television, ¿Qué Pasa, USA? broke down barriers."},
{"title": "The Best Roles of Glynis Johns", "date": "Thursday, October 5, 2023", "text": "Today legendary actress Glynis Johns turned 100 years old. She had a remarkable career that lasted decades, from the late Thirties to the late Nineties. She appeared on stage, in film, and on television. With an ethereal beauty, Glynis Johns could have made a good living simply playing romantic interests on stage and in film, but instead she played a wide variety of roles. Over the years she played everything from a mermaid to a suffragette to a famed author. What is more, she played all of them well. For that reason, choosing Glynis Johns's best roles is not an easy task.Glynis Johns was born on October 5 1923 in Pretoria, Union of South Africa. It would be accurate to say that acting was in her blood. Her father was Welsh actor Melvyn Johns, perhaps most familiar to viewers today from his role in the horror classic Dead of Night (1945). Her mother was Alyce Steele-Wareham, an esteemed concert pianist and an accomplished violinist. Her family having returned to the United Kingdom not long after her birth, she started training in ballet when she was only five years old. At eight years old she played Sonia Kuman in the play Judgement Day at the Phoenix Theatre in London. She was only fifteen when she made her film debut in South Riding in 1938. Coming from a theatrical family and trained nearly from birth to perform, there is little wonder that Glynis Johns should be a remarkable talent.Without further ado, here are what I consider to be Glynis Johns's five best roles, although I could list many more.Miranda (1948): Based on the play by Peter Blackmore, Miranda starred Glynis Johns as the mermaid of the title. Miranda has an incredible power over men, complicated by the fact that she tends to flirt with every single man she meets. Naturally, this arouses jealousy in the wives of these men. Much to the misfortune of Claire Martin (Googie Withers), Miranda is most interested in her husband, Dr. Paul Martin (Griffith Jones). A lesser actress may have depended primarily upon their looks to play Miranda, but Glynis Johns endows the character with a real personality, making the mermaid all the more seductive. Miranda was released the same year as the Hollywood classic Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid (1948), starring William Powell and Ann Blyth. As much as I love Ann Blyth and as good a job as she did in Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid, I think Glynis Johns was actually the better of the two.The Court Jester (1955): In The Court Jester, Danny Kaye plays Hubert Hawkins, a minstrel of a band of rebels led by the Black Fox. To infiltrate the castle, the rebels meet and then knock unconscious tyrannical King Roderick's new court jester, Giacomo (John Carradine), so Hubert can assume his identity and infiltrate the king's castle. Among the captains of the rebels is Maid Jean, played by Glynis Johns. Jean is a far cry from Maid Marian in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Jean is skilled with the sword and with the bow, and fight better than most men. At the same time Jean is sweet natured and it is her love for justice that found her among the rebels to begin with. As a trained dancer, Glynis Johns easily pulls off Jean's physicality, while at the same time infusing her with both a passion for justice and genuine concern for her fellow human beings.The Sundowners (1960): In The Sundowners Glynis Johns played a role that was well removed from Miranda or Jean. She played Mrs. Firth, the owner of the local pub in Cawndilla. Mrs. Firth is feisty, loud, talkative, and very flirtatious. While Mrs. Firth does not have a lot of screen time, Glynis Johns makes her easily the most interesting character in the film, through her body language, her eyes, and her voice.Mary Poppins (1964): There can be no doubt that Glynis Johns is perhaps best known as Winifred Banks, the wife of banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) in Mary Poppins. The movie was the highest grossing film of 1964, beating out both My Fair Lady and Goldfinger And it has remained popular ever since. Much of the reason for the film's success was its cast, in particular Julie Andrews as the nanny of the title, who was \"practically prefect in every way.\" While Julie Andrews was the star of Mary Poppins, the rest of the cast got to shine as well. Glynis Johns delivers a fine performance as Winifred Banks. Winifred is easily distracted and nearly all-consumed by the suffrage movement, to the point that she sometimes does not pay that much attention to her children.  At the same time she tries to be a model mother and wife, something complicated by her husband George Banks's demand for an overly efficiently run household. Winifred is not given a lot to do in Mary Poppins, but Glynis Johns brings her to life wonderfully.The Vault of Horror (1973): The Vault of Horror is one of the portmanteau horror movies made by Amicus Productions. It was a follow-up to Tales from the Crypt (1972), and both films were inspired by classic EC Comics stories. Glynis Johns appears in the segment \"The Neat Job,\" once more playing a wife and homemaker. In this case she is Eleanor Critchit, the trophy wife of Arthur Critchit (Terry-Thomas). To say Arthur is obsessive-compulsive when it comes to neatness might be an understatement. Unfortunately, housekeeping is not among Eleanor's talents, and she sometimes makes more of a mess than she cleans things up. Of course, this leads to constant nagging from Arthur. This being based on an EC Comics story, Eleanor does eventually get her revenge. Glynis Johns does a wonderful job of playing Eleanor, endowing the character with a personality and generating a good deal of sympathy for her in the brief time she has on screen."},

He was perfect as the pianist Jan Jarmokowski in the Amicus Productions horror movie The Beast Must Die. He gave a fantastic performance as Albert Spica, the brutal, coarse gangster who wants to be a gourmet in The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover. On television he did well as mystery writer Phillip E. Marlow and the fictional detective of his creation. He gave a good performance as Chief Inspector Maigret on the 1992 TV series Maigret.

{"title": "The 60th Anniversary of My Favorite Martian", "date": "Friday, September 29, 2023", "text": "It was sixty years ago, on September 29 1963, that My Favorite Martian debuted on CBS. In many ways, it was a pioneering show. It was the success of My Favorite Martian that would lead to such shows as Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie. It would also prove popular. While on the air, My Favorite Martin produced merchandise from comic books to a board game. After it had gone off the air, it would have a successful syndication run, and it would result in a Saturday morning cartoon and even a feature film.My Favorite Martian centred on a 450-year-old anthropologist from Mars, later revealed to be named Exigius 12 1/2 (Ray Walston), who crashes lands on Earth. He is found by Tim O'Hara (Bill Bixby), a reporter for The Los Angeles Sun. With the Martian stranded on Earth due to damage to his spaceship, Tim takes him in and tells others that he is his Uncle Martin. Tim agrees to keep Martin's identity secret and not to reveal that he is from Mars. By the same token, Martin decides not to exhibit his special abilities around Earthlings. As to Martin's abilities, they are numerous. He has retractable antennae in the back of his head.  He has telekinesis and can lift and move objects by moving his index finger. He can read minds. He can become invisible. He can also speed himself or others up, and even freeze people and objects in place. On top of all this, he is an inventor who can develop advanced technology. Tim and Martin live in a garage apartment they rent from Lorelei Brown (Pamela Britton). According to an article from the Newspaper Enterprise Association in October 1963, My Favorite Martian was created by John L. Greene, who had earlier written for shows such as My Friend Irma and Our Miss Brooks. John L. Greene had created Uncle Martin in a script that he had sent to a major talent agency. It was three years after he had sent the script to the agency that Jack Chertok, who had produced Private Secretary and The Lone Ranger, among other shows, found John L. Greene's script at the bottom of a stack of scripts at the agency. Jack Chertok informed the agency that he liked the script. One of the people at the agency told Mr. Chertok, \"It's the worst idea around here. It has been read by everyone and always winds up at the bottom of the stack.\" Jack Chertok told him, \"That's why I want it.\" From the beginning Ray Walston and Bill Bixby were wanted for the roles of Uncle Martin and Tim O'Hara respectively. Ray Walston had appeared in the London production of the musical South Pacific and in the 1958 film version as well, and he played the Devil in both the Broadway musical Damn Yankees and the 1958 film version of that musical. He also appeared in the movie The Apartment (1960). Bill Bixby has made guest appearances on such shows as Dobie Gillis, Make Room for Daddy, and The Andy Griffith Show. The role of landlady Lorelei Brown was conceived as being an older lady, but actress Pamela Britton was able to persuade Jack Chertok that she should be younger. Pamela Britton had appeared in the classic film noir D.O.A. (1950) and had played Blondie in the 1957 sitcom Blondie, based on the popular comic strip of the same name. The first season of My Favorite Martian featured J. Pat O'Malley as Tim's boss at The Los Angeles Sun, Mr. Burns. In the second and third seasons, Alan Hewitt played Detective Bill Brennan, who was very suspicious of Uncle Martin. Roy Engel appeared in six episodes of the third season as a police captain.The pilot for My Favorite Martian differed from the regular series. It was filmed in 1962 and it was on the basis of that pilot that CBS bought the show in January 1963. The original pilot featured Ina Victor as Mrs. Brown's twenty-year-old niece Annabelle. She would not appear in the regular series.  Mrs. Brown's fifteen-year-old daughter Angela, played by Ann Marshall, only appeared in three episodes of My Favorite Martian (including the pilot), all during the first season.For seven episodes of the first season of My Favorite Martian, Sherwood Schwartz, later of Gilligan's Island fame, served as the show's script consultant. CBS had been having trouble with new episodes beyond the pilot. According to Mr. Schwartz, after looking at unfinished episodes, he determined that the problem was that instead of focusing on Uncle Martin as a fish out of water, the episodes were focusing more on Tim O'Hara. Sherwood Schwartz then threw out many of the scripts and kept five or six scripts that could be salvaged through rewriting.  In his own words, Mr. Schwartz felt that he simply put the show back on the track set by the pilot.For the most part, My Favorite Martian was well-received by critics, if not overwhelmingly so. Associated Press television and radio writer Cynthia Lowry gave My Favorite Martian a largely positive review, noting \"The big problem, of course, will be achieving audience acceptance--adult acceptance, that is, because children are accustomed to taking out-of-this-world creatures in stride.\" Columnist Bob Foster wrote, \"My Favorite Martian probably will cause quite a sensation, although personally I don't warm up to this type of thing.\" Columnist Erskine Johnson noted, \"My Favorite Martian, at least, has imagination and is a departure from most of television's domestic comedies, all of which boil down to My Favorite Husband (or Wife).\" My Favorite Martian proved to be a hit in its first season, coming in at no. 10 in the Nielsen ratings for the year. In its second season, My Favorite Martian dropped in the ratings, although it came in at a still respectable no. 24 for the year. The third season would see major changes for the show. It shifted from being shot in black-and-white to being shot in colour. While during its first two seasons, My Favorite Martian was shot at Desilu, for its third season it was shot at MGM's studios in Culver City. It was during the summer of 1965 that Lucille Ball, the head of Desilu, decided that the studio needed the soundstages then being rented to Jack Chertok for a new show they were producing called Star Trek. Of course, this meant that the show now had access to MGM's large backlot. The success of My Favorite Martian would result in merchandise associated with the show. Gold Key published nine issues of a My Favorite Martian comic book from 1964 to 1966. Transogram put out a My Favorite Martian board game. There was also a beanie with antennae, a magic set put out by Gilbert, a colouring book published by Golden Press, and various other items. Unfortunately, it was during the third season that My Favorite Martian also had something of a crisis. Ray Walston was unhappy with the quality of many of the scripts and decided as a result that he wanted to appear less on the show. It was because of this that Uncle Martin's eleven-year-old nephew Andromeda was introduced on the show, played by Wayne Stam. As it turned out, Andromeda only appeared in one episode, and CBS did not particularly care for the idea. He only appeared in the 24th episode of the third season, \"When You Get Back to Mars, Are You Going to Get It,\" and did not appear in the remainder of the season. As it turns out, My Favorite Martian dropped in the Nielsen ratings during its third season, so it no longer ranked in the top thirty of the year. CBS cancelled My Favorite Martian, perhaps due to the show's ratings and the fact that Ray Walston wanted to reduce his participation on the show. My Favorite Martian.While My Favorite Martian had ended its network run, it was neither gone nor forgotten. The show went into syndication as a rerun, where it proved to be popular. The continued popularity of the show resulted in a revival of sorts as a Saturday morning cartoon titled My Favorite Martians. The show was produced by Filmation, in conjunction with Jack Chertok Productions. Neither Ray Walston nor Bill Bixby returned to voice their characters from My Favorite Martian. Instead, Jonathan Harris (best known as Dr. Smith on Lost in Space) voiced Uncle Martin, while Howard Morris (of Your Show of Shows and The Andy Griffith Show fame) voiced Tim O'Hara. Lorelei Brown was voiced by Jane Webb, who also voiced the new character of Tim's niece Katy. Howard Morris also voiced multiple characters, including Detective Bill Brennan and the new characters of a Martian dog called Okey, a chimp named Chump, and Detective Brennan's son named Brad. Despite the additional characters, My Favorite Martians did use scripts meant for the unrealized fourth season of the original television show. My Favorite Martians debuted on CBS on September 8 1973. It spent only one season on Saturday morning and was rerun the following season on Sunday morning on CBS.In 1995, Ray Walston appeared in a commercial for AT&T. It was implied that his character was Uncle Martin looking for affordable long-distance rates to call Mars.In 1999 a feature film based on the TV show, also titled My Favorite Martian, was released. It starred Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Martin and Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara. Ray Walston appeared as a Martian who had been stranded on Earth for years. The film was not particularly well-received by critics. It also did not click with audiences and failed at the box office.Regardless, My Favorite Martian continues to be popular. It has aired on AmericanLife TV, TV Land, COZI TV, and Antenna TV. The show has been released on both VHS and DVD. My Favorite Martian is available on multiple streaming services, including Peacock, Pluto TV, Tubi, Vudu, Prime Video, Plex, Freevee, and others.As mentioned earlier, Esrkine Johnson noted that My Favorite Martian was different from television's domestic comedies, which might well explain its success. There had only been a few fantasy sitcoms on the air before My Favorite Martian, and only two had seen any real success. Topper may well have been the first fantasy sitcom, debuting in 1953. It was followed in 1961 by Mister Ed, starring the famous talking horse. The success of My Favorite Martian would spark an entire cycle of fantasy sitcoms. The following season would see the debut of such shows as The Addams Family, Bewitched, The Munsters, and My Living Doll. The following seasons would see such sitcoms as I Dream of Jeannie, The Smothers Brothers Show, The Flying Nun, and The Ghost & Mrs. Muir. It seems possible that none of these shows would have aired if My Favorite Martian had not been a hit. It seems likely My Favorite Martian was responsible for further sitcoms centred around aliens, including Mork & Mindy, ALF, Third Rock from the Sun, and the short-lived show The Neighbors. Sixty years after its debut, the influence of My Favorite Martian is still being felt."},
{"title": "Close Channel D: The Late, Great David McCallum", "date": "Tuesday, September 26, 2023", "text": "For many Baby Boomers and older Gen Xers, David McCallum was their first crush. For others, like myself, David McCallum was one of their childhood heroes. He played ultra-cool Russian U.N.C.L.E. agent Illya Kuryakin on The Man From U.N.C.L.E., a phenomenon when it first aired and later a popular rerun in syndication. For younger audiences he may be best remembered as Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard, the eccentric, intellectual chief medical examiner on NCIS. As identified as he was with both roles, David McCallum had a career that spanned seventy years and played numerous other roles, from Lieutenant Commander Eric Ashley-Pitt (\"Dispersal\") in The Great Escape (1963) to Steel in the British cult television show Sapphire & Steel. Sadly, David McCallum died yesterday, September 25 2023, only a little under a week after having turned 90.David Keith McCallum Jr. was born on September 19 1933 in Glasgow. His father was, David McCallum Sr., was an orchestral violinist and his mother Dorothy McCallum (née Dorman) was a cellist. He was only three when his family moved to London where his father played as leader in the London Philharmonic Orchestra. With World War II young David McCallum was evacuated to Gatocharn, Scotland, where he lived with is mother. David McCallum was encouraged by his parents to pursue a career in music. He learned to play the oboe as well as the piano and the English horn. As it turned out, David McCallum learned he was more interested in acting. He played the Little Prince in Shakespeare's King John when he was only eight years old, and he believed that is what led him to decide to be an actor. David McCallum attended University College School in Hampstead, London. When he was 13, he began providing voices for BBC radio shows. For his National Service, David McCallum served in the British Army's 3rd Battalion the Middlesex Regiment. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Among his classmates was Joan Collins. He played with the Oxford Repertory Group. David McCallum made his television debut in the television mini-series The Rose and the Ring in 1953. His film debut was an uncredited role in Ill Met By Moonlight (1957). That same year he was cast in Clive Donner's directorial debut The Secret Place (1957), playing rebellious Cockney Mike Wilson. David McCallum signed with the Rank Organization. In the late Fifties he appeared in the films These Dangerous Years (1957), Hell Drivers (1957), Robbery Under Arms (1957), Violent Playground (1958), A Night to Remember (1958), and Jungle Street (1960). On television he was a regular on the TV program The Eustace Diamonds. He appeared in the mini-series Our Mutual Friend and played Frank Churchill in the mini-series Emma. He guest starred on the shows Television World Theatre, Saturday Playhouse, BBC Sunday-Night Play, Armchair Theatre, ITV Television Playhouse, and Knight Errant Limited.It was in 1964 that David McCallum began playing Illya Kuryakin on The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Initially, Illya was meant to be a minor character, with the show centred firmly on Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo. Audience reaction to the character proved to be so positive that the producer eventually made David McCallum a co-star on the show, on equal footing with Robert Vaughn. The Man From U.N.C.L.E. proved to be something of a fad, achieving phenomenal ratings and producing a treasure trove of merchandise. David McCallum became a heartthrob among teenage girls and younger women, and he received more fan mail than any other actor in the history of MGM, even such well-known stars as Clark Gable and Judy Garland. Changes in time slot and a shift to camp in the show's third season resulted in a drop in ratings, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was cancelled midway in its fourth season.In addition to his regular role on The Man From U.N.C.L.E., David McCallum also guest starred on the TV shows ITV Play of the Week, Sir Francis Drake, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, Perry Mason, The Great Adventure, The Outer Limits, Profiles in Courage, and Please Don't Eat the Daisies (as Illya Kuryakin). In the classic movie The Great Escape (1963), he played Lieutenant Commander Ashley-Pitt, who devised a means of getting ride of the dirt excavated from the escape tunnels. He also appeared in the movies The Long and the Short and the Tall (1961), Karolina Rijecka (1961), Billy Budd (1962), Freud (1962), The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), Around the World Under the Sea (1966), Three Bites of the Apple (1967), Sol Madrid (1968), Mosquito Squadron (1969), and La cattura (1969).In the Seventies David McCallum starred on the British TV show Colditz, the short-lived American series The Invisible Man, and the British cult sci-fi series Sapphire & Steel. He also appeared in the mini-series Kidnapped. David McCallum guest starred on the TV shows Night Gallery; The Man and the City; Marcus Welby, M.D.; Norman Corwin Presents; and Bert D'Angelo/Superstar. He appeared in the movies The Kingfisher Caper (1975), Dogs (1977), King Solomon's Treasure (1979), and The Watcher in the Woods (1980).In the Eighties David McCallum continued to star as Steel on Sapphire & Steel. He appeared in the mini-series Mother Love and Lucky Chances. He reprised his role as Illya Kuryakin in the television reunion movie The Return of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair, and he was again reunited with Robert Vaughn on in a role very similar to Illa Kuryakin in the A-Team episode \"The Say U.N.C.L.E. Affair.\" He also guest starred on the TV shows Strike Force; Hart to Hart; As the World Turns; The Master; Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense; Matlock; Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Monsters; Father Dowling Mysteries; Murder, She Wrote; and Boon. He appeared in the movies Terminal Choice (1985), Az aranyifjú (1987), and The Haunting of Morella (1990).In the Nineties David McCallum starred in the TV shows Cluedo, Trainer, VR.5., and Team Knight Rider. He guest starred on the shows SeaQuest DSV, Babylon 5, Heartbeat, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Law & Order, The Outer Limits, Three, Sex and the City, and Deadline. He appeared in the movies Hear My Song (1991), Dirty Weekend (1993), Fatal Inheritance (1993), Healer (1994), and Cherry (1999). In the Naughts David McCallum first played Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard in the two-part JAG episode \"Ice Queen\"/\"Meltdown\" that served as a backdoor pilot for NCIS. That autumn he began his long run of playing the character on NCIS. He ultimately played Ducky for twenty years, appearing in more episodes of NCIS than any other actor. He also starred on the show The Education of Max Bickford and voiced C.A.R. on the animated series The Replacements and Professor Paradox on the animated series Ben 10: Alien Force and Ben 10: Ultimate Alien. He guest starred on the TV show Jeremiah, and was a guest voice on the animated series Batman: The Brave and the Bold. He was the voice of Alfred Pennyworth in the animated movie Batman: Gotham Knight (2008) and the voice of Zeus in the animated movie Wonder Woman (2009). In the Teens David McCallum continued to play Ducky on NCIS. He also appeared as Ducky on the spin-off NCIS: New Orleans. He continued to voice Professor Paradox in the animated shows Ben 10: Omiverse. He provided the voice of Alfred Pennyworth in the animated movies Son of Batman (2014) and Batman vs. Robin (2015). In the 2020s he continued to play Ducky on NCIS.In addition to appear in film and screen, David McCallum also provided voices for such video games as Ben 10: Alien Force--Vilgax Attacks, Diablo III, and NCIS. Trained as a musician, David McCallum would have something of a music career. In the Sixties he recorded four albums of instrumentals for Capitol Records: Music...A Part of Me, Music...A Bit More of Me, Music...It's Happening Now!, and McCallum. His composition \"The Edge\" would later be sampled by rap artists and would appear in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV and the movie Baby Driver (2017). David McCallum also wrote a novel, a thriller titled Once a Crooked Man.It seems very likely David McCallum will always be best remembered as Illya Kuryakin on The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Dr. Mallard on NCIS, and Ashley-Pitt in The Great Escape. And I don't think that is merely do to the continued popularity of The Man From U.N.C.L.E., NCIS, and The Great Escape. Quite simply, he was fantastic in all three roles. He was perfect as Illa Kuryakin, the mysterious, super-cool U.N.C.L.E. agent. The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences was obviously impressed with is performance as Illya, nominating him twice for the Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievements in Entertainment - Actors and Performers and the Emmy for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series. He was also impressive as Ducky on NCIS, the jocular, but intellectual medical examiner. He stood out in an ensemble cast in The Great Escape as Lieutenant Commander Ashley-Pitt.Of course, David McCallum played many more roles than Illya Kuryakin, Dr. Mallard, and Lieutenant Commander Ashley-Pitt. Many will remember him as the stoic, irascible Steel on Sapphire & Steel, a show that can aptly be described as a cross between Doctor Who and The X-Files. On Colditz he played the fiercely independent Flight Lieutenant Simon Carter, who was always antagonistic towards his German captors. He played the radio operator of the RMS Titanic in the classic A Night to Remember. In Violent Playground he played a role as far removed from Illya, Ducky, and Steel as one could get: a violent juvenile delinquent and street gang leader named Johnnie Murphy. Even in his guest appearances on various shows David McCallum could be impressive. In the Perry Mason episode \"The Case of the Fifty Millionth Frenchman,\" he played Phillipe Bertain, a Frenchman who has no luck with women (ironically, only a few months later Mr McCallum would play the heartthrob of millions, Illya Kuryakin). In the Outer Limits episode \"The Sixth Finger,\" he played a Welsh miner who agrees to an experiment to accelerate evolution, with disastrous results. David McCallum was an incredible actor who played  a wide variety of roles. What is more, he played all of them well."},
{"title": "Thank You For a Successful 10th Annual Rule, Britannia Blogathon", "date": "Monday, September 25, 2023", "text": "I want to thank everyone who participated in the 10th Annual Rule, Britannia Blogathon for making it a success. It is hard to believe that there have been 10 editions of the blogathon, and that wouldn't have happened if not for my fellow bloggers stepping up to take part in it. In 1993 when it first started, the blogathon was called \"the British Invaders Blogathon\" and took place in August. It was in 2018 (the fifth year of the blogathon) that I changed its name to \"the Rule, Britannia Blogathon.\" Given some of the regular participants in the blogathon are British, it made no sense to call it \"the British Invaders Blogathon!\" In 2020 I moved the Rule, Britannia Blogathon to the next to the last weekend of September. That year it slipped my mind to announce the blogathon in June as I usually do, and so I moved it to September to give participants more time to get ready for it. I have kept it in September ever since, as it makes my two blogathons (the other being the Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon in March) around six months apart.I think this year's blogathon has been one of the best. We had entries on movies from the 1930s to 1980s. The posts also encompassed a wide array of genres, from comedies to romance movies to science fiction movies. Some of the most respected British directors were also represented, including Terence Fisher, Alfred Hitchcock, Alan Parker, and Michael Powell. Anyway, I can guarantee the Rule, Britannia  Blogathon will be back next year for an eleventh edition!"},
{"title": "Local Hero (1983)", "date": "Saturday, September 23, 2023", "text": "(This post is a part of the 10th Annual Rule, Britannia Blogathon Hosted by A Shroud of Thoughts)This past February 17th marked 40 years since the release of a remarkable film, Local Hero (1983) directed by Bill Forsyth.  Bill Forsyth had already received attention for his movies That Sinking Feeling (1979) and Gregory's Girl (1981). While I would not see That Sinking Feeling until later, I had already seen Gregory's Girl when Local Hero came out. When I finally got to see Local Hero on VHS, I was not disappointed. It remains one of my all-time favourite movies to this day.Local Hero centres on \"Mac\" MacIntyre (Peter Riegert), a young executive at Knox Oil and Gas in Houston, Texas. Because his name sounds \"Scottish,\" Mac finds himself set to the Highlands of Scotland by the head of Knox Oil and Gas, the eccentric Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster), to acquire the tiny village of Furness to open a refinery there. Once there, Mac learns that the plan is to entirely replace Furness with the refinery. While Mac grows to love Furness and have doubts about the clearing the village to make way for a refinery, the villagers are more than eager to sell out to Knox Oil and Gas. As it turns out, there is one holdout: elderly beachcomber Ben Knox (Fulton MacKay). Ben owns the entirety of the beach by way of  a grant from the Lord of the Isles to one of his ancestors. Without the beach, there can be no refinery, and Ben absolutely refuses to sell. Local Hero emerged from producer David Puttnam and director Bill Forsyth. The two men had met in London in the late Seventies. At the time Bill Forsyth gave David Putnam the script to Gregory's Girl in hopes that he would produce it, but Mr. Puttnam turned it down, thinking it was too similar to That Sinking Feeling. After seeing Gregory's Girl, David Puttnam admitted to regretting not accepting the movie. The two would meet again, quite by chance, in a tobacconist shop in Soho. At the time Bill Forsyth was busy editing Gregory's Girl, while David Puttnam was finishing up Chariots of Fire (1981). It was only a matter of days before David Puttnam asked Bill Forsyth to attend a screening of the classic Whisky Galore! (1949). The Ealing Studios movie is set on the tiny, fictional Scottish island of Todday in the Outer Hebries where the supply of whisky runs out during World War II. David Puttnam had good reason for wanting Bill Forsyth to see Whisky Galore!. The producer had been researching the Scottish oil industry, in particular the oil boom in Shetland in the early Seventies. What struck David Puttnam is that the Shetlanders actually welcomed the oil companies, in hopes that the large amount of money generated by oil would in turn help them. David Puttnam then talked Bill Forsyth into developing the idea for what would become Local Hero.In the book Local Hero: The Making of the Film by Allan Hunter and Mark Astaire, Bill Forsyth said of Local Hero, \"I saw it along the lines of a Scottish Beverly Hillbillies--what would happen to a small community when it suddenly became immensely rich--that was the germ of the idea and the story built itself from there. It seemed to contain a similar theme to Brigadoon (1954), which also involved some Americans coming over to Scotland, becoming part of a small community, being changed by the experience and affecting the place in their own way. I feel close in spirit to the Powell and Pressburger feeling the idea of trying to present a cosmic viewpoint to people, but through the most ordinary things. And because this film and I Know Where I Am Going (1945) are set in Scotland, I've felt from the beginning that we're walking the same...treading the same water.\"Initially Local Hero centred on the character of the local hotel owner, who would tackle the American oil company and its representative (Mac in the movie). Over time the story began to focus more on Mac, the American oil company representative who initially finds himself out of place in Furness. Although today, it might seem difficult for fans of Local Hero to see anyone as Mac but Peter Reigert. Bill Forsyth had also considered Michael Douglas and Henry Winkler. From the beginning Burt Lancaster was considered for the role of eccentric billionaire Felix Happer, although casting him presented some problems. Burt Lancaster wanted a $2 million salary. That would have been a third of the movie's entire budget. Fortunately, Warner Bros. made producer David Puttnam an American distribution deal once they knew Burt Lancaster was to be in the movie and as a result provided the money to pay for the Hollywood legend. As might be expected, aside from Peter Riegert and Burt Lancaster, the majority of the cast of Local Hero was comprised of British actors. Fulton MacKay, who played beachcomber Ben Knox, had a career on stage and on screen going back to the late Forties. Many might remember him best for his appearances on such classic television shows as The Saint and The Avengers. Denis Lawson, who played hotel owner and accountant Gordon Urquhart, played Wedge Antilles in both Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980). On television he'd appeared in episodes of Dr. Finlay's Casebook and Bergerac. For Peter Capaldi, who played local Knox Oil and Gas representative Danny Oldsen (and hence Mac's guide to Furness), Local Hero was only his second film. Of course, he has since become known as Malcolm Tucker on The Thick of It and the Twelfth Doctor on Doctor Who. Of course, among the stars of Local Hero must be counted the Scottish landscape. The movie required a small Scottish village with an extensive beach. As a result, production designer Roger Murray-Leach scouted the Scottish coast for just such a village. Ultimately a small fishing village called Pennan, located in Aberdeenshire, was chosen. Unfortunately, while Pennan's only street did overlook the sea, it was not particularly close to the beach. For the beach in Local Hero, Camusdarach Beach, just south of the estuary of River Morar and between the village of Arisaig, in Lochaber, Inverness-shire and the village of Morar, Inverness-shire, was used. Unfortunately, once completed Local Hero would run afoul of test screenings, as many a movie has. While the test screenings were positive, they were not overwhelmingly so. It as after the last test screening that Warner Bros. executives sat down with Bill Forsyth and even offered to pay the bill to shoot a new ending in which Mac doesn't leave Scotland. This did not sit well with Bill Forsyth, who hardly wanted to go back to Scotland simply to shoot a new scene. In the end, Warner Bros. would not get the ending they wanted, although it is hard to argue Local Hero does not have a happy ending.Local Hero premiered on February 17 1983 in New York City. It opened in the Untied States on February 18 1983, which also happened to be Presidents Day weekend that year. That weekend it made $23,567 that weekend, which was actually quite respectable given it was competing against movies like Gandhi and Tootsie. For the most part Local Hero got good reviews. Janet Maslin in The New York Tiems wrote, \"Genuine fairy tales are rare; so is film-making that is thoroughly original in an unobtrusive way. Bill Forsyth's quirky disarming Local Hero is both.\" Roger Ebert loved the film, writing, \"Here is a small film to treasure, a loving, funny, understated portrait of a small Scottish town and its encounter with a giant oil company.\" In The Village Voice Andrew Sarris described the movie as \"...a joyously grown-up, warm-hearted, and clear-head meditation on the vagaries of contemporary existence.\"Local Hero did respectably well at the box office. It earned $5.895, 761 in the United States and £487,437 in the United Kingdom. While that might not sound like a lot, given its budget was only around $3 million, it did make a small profit. Of course, it would also be shown on premium cable channels and it would be released on VHS and still later on DVD. Like Gregory's Girl before it, it would become a cult film. Indeed, Local Hero has left behind a legacy few movies do. There is a minor planet, 7345 Happer, named for Felix Happer from the film, who was absolutely  obsessed with astronomy. I have always suspected that the hit American television series Northern Exposure, in which a New York City doctor must adjust to life in a small Alaskan town, and possibly the cult series Everwood, in which a big city brain surgeon moves to the small town of Everwood, both drew inspiration from Local Hero. The movie also inspired a 2019 musical, Local Hero, which premiered at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh. As I said earlier, Local Hero remains one of my favourite movies of all time. Indeed, I think it says a lot about how many people do not realize how good they really have it. The villagers of Furness, tired of their hard lives, are anxious to simply sell the village to Knox Oil and Gas. It is an outsider. Mac, who realizes just how special and how magical Furness really is. What is more, Local Hero moves at a deliberate pace. We are given time to get to know the characters. And while it does move quite leisurely, Local Hero is never slow. It really doesn't have a plot, so much as things simply happen as they would in real life. Indeed, there are a number of coincidences in the movie that appear to have been created with intent. There are also some unanswered questions. Is Marina (Jenny Seagrove), the Knox Oil and Gas oceanographer who is so much at home in the sea, actually a selkie? Who is the child always wheeled around Furness by a group of men? If I have only one criticism of Local Hero it is that the movie is largely dominated by men. Of the major characters, only two of them are women, and it seems likely that Marina is not even human (yes, I honestly think she is a selkie). Jennifer Black, as Stella Urquhart is the only woman in the village with an important role in the film. Regardless, I do love Local Hero. In many respects, I think Janet Maslin in her New York Times review is very much correct--Local Hero is indeed a fairy tale. It does not surprise me that I am not alone in my love for Local Hero. It is very much a cult film that remains popular to this day."},

{"title": "Estelita Rodriguez: \"The Cuban Fireball\"", "date": "Thursday, September 21, 2023", "text": "Today Estelita Rodriguez may be best remembered her for supporting roles in Republic Pictures B-Westerns with Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, as well as her appearance in the classic Western Rio Bravo (1959). Even so, there was a time that Estelita Rodriguez appeared to be poised for stardom. While at Republic Pictures she starred in short series of musical comedies in which Republic attempted to duplicate the success of Mexican superstar Lupe Vélez. Indeed, many of Estelita's film comedies, starting with  Cuban Fireball (1951), were co-written by Charles E. Roberts, the screenwriter behind the Mexican Spitfire films, starring Lupe Vélez, at RKO. Estelita Rodriguez was born on July 2 1928 in Guanajay, Cuba. She began singing and dancing when she was still very young, around nine years old. By 1940 she was performing with Tito Puente and the Anselmo Sacasas orchestra at the Chicago Colony Club. She was only 14 years old when she performed at the Copacabana in New York City. The young singer and dancer proved successful enough to be signed to a contract with MGM when she was only 15. She attended school at MGM in anticipation of making movies, but ultimately she did not make even one film at the studio. MGM abruptly dropped her and Estelita Rodriguez returned to New York City.At some point, Estelita Rodriguez married Mexican singer Chu-Chu Martinez. Their daughter Nina was born in 1946. Even while married to Chu-Chu Rodriguez, she returned to acting. She signed with Republic Pictures and made her film debut in the Roy Rogers movie Along the Navajo Trail in 1945. For the next few years Estelita appeared in B Westerns at Republic Pictures. She was a regular in Roy Rogers movies, and also appeared in the Wild Bill Elliott film Old Los Angeles. During this period she still performed at night clubs, performing at the Havana-Mardid in New York City in March 1949.Estelita Rodriguez received her first starring role with the comedy Belle of Old Mexico in 1950. The plot involved a World War II veteran who had promised one of his dying comrades during the war to go to Mexico and adopt his daughter. Believing the daughter to be a little girl, he finds out that she is a grown woman and a beautiful one at that. Of course, no one believes their relationship is platonic. Only twenty when she made Belle of Old Mexico, Estelita complained, \"Everyone treats me like a kid. I am a mother.\"Belle of Old Mexico proved to be a hit at the box office, convincing Republic executives that Estelita Rodriguez could be turned into a star. Gossip columnist Erskine John wrote in his column in 1950 that \"Estelita Rodriguez will get the Lupe Vélez treatment at Republic.\" He also noted that she was balking at doing an outright imitation of Miss Vélez. Republic Pictures' follow-up to Belle of Old Mexico showed how much Republic wanted to replicate the success of Lupe Vélez's films. As mentioned above, it was co-written by Charles E. Roberts, who had written all of the Mexican Spitfire films. The first film he co-wrote, Cuban Fireball (1951), could have easily been written for Lupe Vélez years earlier. Estelita Rodriguez played an employee at a cigar factory (named simply \"Estelita\") in Havana who discovers a long lost relative has left her $200,000. She then travels to Los Angles to collect her inheritance. Cuban Fireball was followed by Havana Rose (1951), in which Estelita played Estelita DeMarco, the troublesome daughter of the ambassador from Lower Salamia. The Fabulous Senorita (1952) saw Estelita Rodriguez playing a character named, well, Estelita Rodriguez. In the film she plays the daughter of a Cuban businessman who tries helping her sister Manuela marry the man she wants. The film is notable for being one of the earliest starring roles for Rita Moreno, who played Estelita's sister. The final of the Republic Pictures comedies in which Estelita starred was Tropical Heat Wave (1952). Once more Estelita Rodriguez plays a character named Estelita, this time a nightclub singer who falls in love with a college professor studying criminal psychology. Republic apparently had so much faith in Estelita Rodriguez that eventually they started billing her simply by her first name, Estelita. All the while Estelita Rodriguez was starring in musical comedies at Republic Pictures, she continued to appear in B-Westerns at the studio. She appeared in Twilight of the Sierras (1950), Sunset in the West (1950), In Old Amarillo (1951), and Pals of the Golden West (1951) with Roy Rogers, Twilight in the Sierras (1950) with Gene Autry, California Passage (1950) with Forrest Tucker, and South Pacific Trail (1952) with Rex Allen. She also appeared in the crime drama Federal Agent at Large (1950).Following Tropical Heat Wave, Estelita parted ways with Republic Pictures to become a freelancer. She appeared in the movie Tropic Zone (1953) for Paramount Pictures. She returned to Republic Pictures for Sweethearts on Parade (1953). Estelita would not appear in films for many years following Sweethearts on Parade. She returned to performing at clubs. In September 1953 she performed at the Wolhurst Country Club in Colorado in September 1953. Later that month she performed at the Coconut Grove in Miami, Florida. In December 1953 she performed at the Empire Room of the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. According to the book West Side Story: The Jets, The Sharks, and the Making of a Classic, Estelita Rodriguez was considered for the part of Anita in the film version of West Side Story. She was ultimately judged as being \"Fine, but too old.\" She would finally return to the big screen after six years in the classic Rio Bravo (1959). In the film she played Consuela Robante, the temperamental wife of hotel owner Carlos Robante (Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez). The part was small, but one could not help but notice Estelita. Over the next few years Estelita would make guest appearances on television. The same year Rio Bravo was released, she guest starred in the One Step Beyond episode \"The Inheritance.\" In 1960 she guest starred on the Father Knows Best episode \"Cupid Knows Best,\" playing the object of the Anderson family gardener's affections. In the next few years she guest stared on Coronado 9, Laredo, and I Spy.Estelita's final appearance in a feature film was in the B horror movie/Western Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter (1966), in which she had a somewhat sizeable role. The film was released posthumously, in April 1966. According to the book Lupe Vélez: The Life and Career of Hollywood's \"Mexican Spitfire\" by Michelle Vogel, in early March 1966 Estelita Rodriguez was cast as Lupe Vélez in a biopic about the legendary star and Estelita was enthusiastically preparing for the role. Unfortunately, on March 12 1966, Estelita Rodriguez was found dead at the age of 37 on the kitchen floor of her home near Hollywood and Van Nuys, California.  An autopsy was not performed and the cause of death remains unknown to this day.Even though Estelita Rodriguez starred in her own feature films, today she is not particularly well-known and very little has been written about her. With regards to her career, Estelita had two things going against her. First, her career largely unfolded in B-movies, from the Westerns she made with Roy Rogers to the musical comedies in which she starred. For that reason, Estelita's movies would not receive the sort of promotion and distribution that a bigger studio than Republic Pictures, such as MGM or Warner Brothers, could provide. Even today many of her films are unavailable. While many of the Westerns she made at Republic Pictures are available on streaming, many of her musical comedies are not even available on DVD.Second, from the start of her career Estelita Rodriguez was typecast in the stereotypical role of the hot-tempered, highly sexualized Latina. Indeed, this can even be seen in the title of her film Cuban Fireball. In the B-Westerns she made, Estelita generally played fiery Mexican women. An example of this can be found in In Old Amarillo (1951), in which she played Pepita, a fiery cantina singer and the extremely jealous girlfriend of one of the characters. The characters she played in her musical comedies differed primarily from those she played in Westerns only insofar as they were Cuban rather than Mexican. In most of them she played a recent immigrant from Cuba who was a singer or some other sort of entertainer, and who was  always highly sexualized and hot tempered. Cuban Fireball is a prime example of this. The stereotypical roles often required of Estelita may have been made all the worse by the fact that they were already becoming anachronistic. The late Forties and early Fifties saw Hollywood gradually moving towards more realistic portrayals of Latinos, with such movies as Border Incident (1949) and The Ring (1952). The stereotype of the fiery, sexualized Latina persists to some degree to this day, but by the Fifties it was already becoming dated.While Estelita Rodriguez was stuck playing stereotypes for most of her career, there can be no doubt that she had real talent and could have been a huge star had she been born in a later era. Estelita was pretty, petite, and blessed with a wonderful singing voice. On screen she was vivacious and charismatic, and she also had a gift for comedy. That Estelita could have played much more than the hot tempered Latinas she was forced to play at Republic can be seen in some of her guest appearances on television, where she was allowed to play other sorts of roles. It is impossible to say what might have become of Estelita and her career had she lived, but I can't help but wonder if over time she wouldn't have gotten better roles and achieved more fame than she already had.Sadly, Estelita's story is similar to that of many other Latina actresses during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Most of them were forced to play stereotypical roles and often their careers tended to be short. Some, like Lupe Vélez and Maria Montez, died young much as Estelita Rodriguez had. Hollywood during the Golden Age tended to be hard on actresses, and tended to be even harder on actresses who were also Latinas. With her looks and talent, I have to suspect Estelita would have been a bigger star if only had she born in a later, more progressive era."},
{"title": "The 50th Anniversary of Jim Croce's Death", "date": "Wednesday, September 20, 2023", "text": "Tonight is will have been fifty years since singer/songwriter Jim Croce died in a plane crash. On the night of Thursday, September 20 1973, the plane on which Jim Croce was a passenger crashed into a tree upon take-off from  Natchitoches Regional Airport in Natchitoches, Louisiana. The crash also killed pilot Robert N. Elliott, Mr. Croce's manager and booking agent Kenneth D. Cortese, pianist, guitarist, and Mr. Croce's accompanist Maury Muehleisen, his road manager Dennis Rast, and comedian George Stevens. Jim Croce left behind a legacy of songs that remain popular to this day. Jim Croce was born in Pennsylvania and grew up in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, a small town near Philadelphia. He wouldn't develop a serious interest in music until he was attending Villanova University, where he was a member of the college singing group, The Villanova Singers. The group performed at various venues around Philadelphia, and even toured Africa, the Middle East, and Yugoslavia.Jim Croce's debut album, Facets, was released in 1966. The album was self-financed, using $500 Jim and Ingrid Croce had received as a wedding gift from Jim Croce's parents on the condition that the music be used to finance an album. Jim Croce's parents had hoped the album would fail, so that he would give up on music and pursue a more stable career. As it turned out, all 500 copies of Facets sold out.It was from the mid-Sixties to the early Seventies that Jim and Ingrid Croce performed as a duo. It was during this period that Jim Croce began writing his own songs. They proved successful enough to record an album for Capitol Records, Jim & Ingrid Croce. The album contained an early version of the song \"Age,\" which Jim Croce would later re-record for his album I've Got a Name. It was not long afterwards that Jim and Ingrid Croce gave up on the music business. Jim Croce would work a number of jobs, from construction work to truck driving, as well as giving guitar lessons, to pay their bills. Fortunately, after working various jobs, Jim Croce decided to return to music as a career. It was in 1970 that Jim Croce met  Maury Muehleisen. The two began performing together, with Jim Croce accompanying  Maury Muehleisen. Over time Maury Muehleisen began backing Jim Croce, as Mr. Croce took the lead. It was after they learned that Ingrid Croce was pregnant that Jim Croce sent a tape of their music to a producer he knew in New York City. It was then in 1972 that Jim Croce signed a contract for three albums with ABC Records.Jim Croce's first album, You Don't Mess Around with Jim, was released in April 1972. It produced two hit singles in 1972, \"You Don't Mess Around with Jim\" and \"Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels).\" A song from the album, \"Time in a Bottle,\" would later prove to be one of Jim Croce's biggest hits. You Don't Mess Around with Jim was followed by Jim Croce's second album with ABC Records, Life and Times. If anything, Life and Times proved even more successful than You Don't Mess Around with Jim. It went to no. 7 on the Billboard album chart. It produced the hit single, \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,\" which became Mr. Croce's first no. 1 single.Sadly, Jim Croce's death while on tour occurred the day before the release of his single, \"I Got a Name.\" The single proved to be a hit, reaching the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. The album I Got a Name was released in December 1973, and went to no. 2 on the Billboard album chart. In addition to the title song, it also produced the hits \"I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song\" and \"Workin' at the Car Wash Blues.\"As well as \"I Got a Name,\" \"I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song,\" and \"Workin' at the Car Wash Blues\" performed on the charts, it would be an older song that would prove to be his biggest hit following his death and possibly his best remembered song. As mentioned above, \"Time in a Bottle\" appeared on his 1972 album You Don't Mess Around with Jim. Even though it had not been released as a single, \"Time in a Bottle\" received airplay from the beginning. The song was used in the closing credits of the television movie She Lives!, which aired on ABC on September 12 1973. This only increased demand for the song even more. Jim Croce's death gave \"Time in a Bottle\" even more poignancy than it had before, and as a result it was played even more frequently after he had died. It was then in November 1973 that \"Time in a Bottle\" was released as a single. The song reached no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1973.Since Jim Croce's death, several compilation albums have been released, including material that had not been released before. Three live albums have also been released posthumously. A collection of Jim Croce's live appearances was released on DVD in 2003, Have You Heard: Jim Croce Live.If Jim Croce remains popular fifty years after his death, it is because of his sheer talent as a singer and a songwriter. Jim Croce was essentially a storyteller, who told his stories through song. This is certainly true of many of his biggest hits. \"You Don't Mess Around with Jim\" centred around a pool hustler, Big Jim Walker, who gets his comeuppance from a rival pool player, Willie \"Slim\" McCoy. \"Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels)\" was a conversation with a telephone operator, of which we only hear the side of the caller, who is a man seeking the phone number of a lost love. \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\" focuses on the character of the title, a tough guy from the East Side of Chicago who makes the mistake of messing with the wife of a jealous husband. Jim Croce was able to tell stories, sometimes humorous, sometimes poignant, in the format of a three to format song that would stick with people for a long time.Of course, another thing that made Jim Croce's songs great, whether they told stories or not, is that he understood the human condition perfectly and could translate that into song. This can particularly be seen in his love songs, such as \"I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song\" and \"Time in a Bottle.\" Jim Croce's songs were made even more touching by the fact that he had a powerful voice, capable of emoting whatever feeling the song called for.Like many, I have to say that Jim Croce has had an enormous impact on my life. I was not very old when he died, but I remember the day well. I had heard his songs on the radio, and I have to say that I was a fan even then. \"Time in a Bottle\" remains one of my all time favourite songs, even though since 2018 I cannot listen to it without breaking down crying. I am certainly not alone. Jim Croce still maintains a legion of fans, some of who weren't even born when he died. There can be no doubt that Jim Croce will still have a legion of fans fifty years from now."},
{"title": "The Patty Duke Show Turns 60", "date": "Monday, September 18, 2023", "text": "Patty Duke as Patty and Cathy LaneIf ever there was a Golden Age for sitcoms with strange premises, it was the 1960s. Among those sitcoms with strange premises was The Patty Duke Show. The Patty Duke Show starred Patty Duke as teenage, identical cousins (yes, you read that right). Patty Lane was a typical, American teenager, exuberant and talkative, who lived in Brooklyn Heights in New York City. Her identical cousin, Cathy Lane came from Scotland to live with the Lanes. As opposed to Patty, Cathy was intelligent, cultured, and reserved. Their identical appearance were explained by the fact that Patty's father Martin (William Schallert) and Cathy's father Kenneth (also played by William Schallert) were identical twins. Patty Duke had begun her acting career when she was still very young. When she was only eight years old she was signed to talent managers John and Ethel Ross, who had managed her brother. While the Rosses would turn Patty Duke into a star, her time with them was not entirely pleasant. Ultimately, they were both exploitative and abusive. They dictated her whole career. Born Anna Marie Duke, John and Ethel Ross changed her name to \"Patty Duke.\" They plied her with both alcohol and prescription drugs. They even pocketed $1 million of her earnings for themselves. Patty Duke would only see her mother when she came to do the Rosses' laundry.While John and Ethel Ross's management left much to be desired, Patty Duke had real talent even when she was very young. After appearances in movies and on television, Patty Duke was cast as Helen Keller in the Broadway play The Miracle Worker. She won a Theatre World Award for her role in the play in 1960. The Miracle Worker would be adapted as the 1962 movie The Miracle Worker, for which Patty Duke won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.  It was even before Patty Duke had won the Oscar that she was signed to Peter Lawford's production company Chrislaw Productions with the intent of starring her in her own series. A deal was made with the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), who bought The Patty Duke Show on the basis of Patty Duke's name alone. ABC even scheduled the show on Wednesday night at 8:00 PM Eastern without having a premise for the show in place. To create the show, ABC turned to Sidney Sheldon, who had written or co-written the screenplays for such films as The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer (1947), Easter Parade (1948), and Annie Get Your Gun (1950). When Sidney Sheldon's agent Sam Weisbord contacted him about The Patty Duke Show, his initial response was turn the show down because he did not work in television. Sam Weisbord then asked Sidney Sheldon to have lunch with Patty Duke simply out of courtesy, to which Mr. Sheldon consented. During their lunch Sidney Sheldon and Patty Duke hit it off, and he asked her if she would like to have dinner with him, his wife Jorja, and his daughter that night. That night Sidney Sheldon's wife Jorja was as taken with Patty Duke as he was, and the three of them had a pleasant evening. It was while Sidney Sheldon and his wife were having a conversation that they realized Patty Duke had left the table. They found her in their kitchen doing dishes. It was then that Sidney Sheldon decided he would develop The Patty Duke Show. In her autobiography Call Me Anna: The Autobiography of Patty Duke, Patty Duke (who would later be diagnosed with bipolar disorder), theorized that Sidney Sheldon \"...felt I was schizoid and that's how he came up with the concept. There was the perky me and the corporate executive me and rarely the twain shall meet.\" What Patty Duke might not have known at the time is that Sidney Sheldon had also struggled with bipolar disorder for years.The pilot for The Patty Duke Show was filmed on January 1 1963 at MGM Studios in Culver City. The pilot would differ somewhat from the television series. Rather than being set in Brooklyn Heights, it was set in San Francisco. Mark Miller played Martin Lane. Mark Miller objected to the plan to eventually move filming of The Patty Duke Show from New York City to California, so for the series he was replaced by William Schallert, who had earlier played Mr. Pomfritt on Dobie Gillis. Patty's younger brother Ross was played by Charles Herbert in the pilot. In the series he was replaced by Paul O'Keefe.The rest of the cast from the pilot would remain on the television series. Jean Byron played Patty's mother Natalie Lane. Like William Schallert, she was a veteran of Dobie Gillis, having played Mrs. Adams and later Dr. Burkhart on that show. Eddie Applegate played Patty's boyfriend Richard Harrison. In addition to the regular cast, throughout its run The Patty Duke Show featured a number of recurring characters. In the first two seasons Kitty Sullivan played Patty's friend and occasional rival Sue Ellen Turner. In the first season John McGiver played Martin's boss at the newspaper. Donald Doyle appeared as Patty's boyfriend Richard's father, Jonathan Harrison, in the show's first two seasons. Of course, as Patty Duke played both Patty and Cathy, it took visual effects to show the two cousins together. This was accomplished using a split-screen effect, and less often a travelling matte effect. Those times when one of the cousins was not facing the camera, a double for Miss Duke would be used. In the third season an uncredited young actress Rita McLaughlin served as Patty Duke's double. Rita McLaughlin had earlier appeared on Watch Mr. Wizard and was later a regular on the soap operas The Secret Storm and As the World Turns.Throughout its run The Patty Duke Show featured some well-known guest stars. Some famous stars played themselves in episodes. Peter Lawford, whose company Chrislaw Productions was among those responsible for the  show, played himself in one episode. Both Frankie Avalon and Sammy Davis Jr. played themselves in episodes. Troy Donahue, Margaret Hamilton, and Frank Sinatra Jr. all guest starred on the show. Pop duo Chad & Jeremy guest starred as an undiscovered pop act, Nigel & Patrick.The Patty Duke Show debuted on September 18 1963. For the most part reviews for the show were modest. Associated Press television and radio writer Cynthia Lowry wrote, \"The new Patty Duke Show, also on ABC, may not win that able young actress any new performing awards, but as a comedy about a modern teenager, it may amuse teenagers--and maybe even teenagers' parents.\" Columnist Harriet Van Horne thought, \"The Patty Duke Show is a charming half hour for teenagers (ABC)...,\" but added, \"Trouble with the show is that little Miss Duke plays a dual role. And her alter ego, a visiting cousin from Graustark, should be put on the next boat home.\" Rick Du Brow, writing for United Press International, was even less impressed with the show. He wrote that Patty Duke \"...is a beautiful young lady, but she will have to be a miracle worker to do anything with this stupid concept and overall inane offering.\" While The Patty Duke Show may not have impressed many critics, it did prove to be a success with viewers. In its first season it ranked no. 18 for the year in the Nielsen ratings. This was particularly impressive given its competition on Wednesday night was the hit Western The Virginian on NBC, which ranked no. 17 for the year in the ratings. The Patty Duke Show continued to do well in its second season, ranking no.28 for the year.The Patty Duke Show was filmed at Chelsea Studios in New York City for its first two seasons. For one thing, Patty Duke already lived in New York City. For another, Patty Duke was only 16 when the show began, which meant she would have fallen under California's Coogan Act which restricts how many hours child actors can work. Patty Duke turned 18 a little less than halfway through the show's second season. While Patty Duke initially opposed the idea, ABC wanted to move filming of the show to Los Angeles for its third season. This meant a change in the show's sets. And even though The Patty Duke Show was still set in Brooklyn Heights, it also meant new exterior shots. The Lane's house now looked as if it was in a Los Angeles suburb instead of a house in Brooklyn Heights. It was also following her 18th birthday that Patty Duke fired John and Ethel Ross as her managers. John Ross would remain as an associate producer on the show until it ended its run in 1966. Patty Duke has said that none of the other cast and crew were ever aware that the Rosses had abused her. Ratings for The Patty Duke Show dropped again in its third season, so that it no longer ranked in the top thirty of the Nielsen ratings for the year. The Patty Duke Show still did well enough that it could have been renewed. Unfortunately, a disagreement emerged between ABC and United Artists Television. For the 1966-1967 season ABC wanted every one of its television shows to be shot in colour. United Artists Television, perhaps because of the special effects it took to show Patty and Cathy together, insisted it would be too expensive to shoot the show in colour. The Patty Duke Show then ended its original run. The Patty Duke Show would go onto success as a syndicated rerun, airing on local stations throughout the Seventies and into the Eighties. It later aired for several years on Nick at Nite. Still later it would air on such outlets as TV Land, This TV, Antenna TV, MeTV, and Circle. Shout! Factory released the entire run of the show on DVD.  It is currently available on streaming on both Pluto and YouTube.Like many shows in the 1990s, there would be a reunion television movie for The Patty Duke Show. In The Patty Duke Show: Still Rockin' In Brooklyn Heights, Patty and Richard married, had a son, and then divorced after 27 years of marriage. Patty currently worked as a drama teacher at Brooklyn Heights High School. Cathy had returned to Scotland, where she married and was later widowed. She had a son as well. Martin had retired, and he and Natalie had moved to Florida. The plot centred around a Lane family reunion and the Lanes trying to save the high school from being demolished to make way for a shopping centre. The Patty Duke Show: Still Rockin' In Brooklyn Heights aired on April 27 1999 on CBS. Meant as a pilot for a new series, the new show never emerged.In 2009 Patty Duke appeared as Patty and Cathy Lane in a public service announcement for the Social Security Administration. In the announcement, Patty sought help from Cathy about accessing her Social Security benefits and son. The oldest Baby Boomers were approaching retirement age at the time, and so it made sense for the Social Security Administration to appeal to them through a show from their youth. In 2010 another PSA for the Social Security Administration was produced. In that PSA, not only did Patty Duke reprise her role as Patty and Cathy, but William Schallert appeared as Martin, Paul O'Keefe appeared as Ross, and Eddie Applegate appeared as Richard. In the PSA, Patty and Richard appeared to be married.For most of its run The Patty Duke Show was a somewhat predictable sitcom, even given its unusual premise. What made it remarkable was its cast. Patty Duke did very well playing both Patty and Cathy, and it was not difficult telling the identical cousins apart through their speech patterns and body language alone. William Schallert and Jean Byron were impressive as Patty's parents Martin and Natalie. Indeed, William Schallert not only played Martin, but Martins' twin brother Kenneth, and Martin and Kenneth's Uncle Jed as well. While the average episode of The Patty Duke Show may not have held any surprises for viewers, over all the show was quite funny. Today The Patty Duke Show still holds up very well, so that audiences will still be watching it for years to come."},
{"title": "The 60th Anniversary of The Fugitive", "date": "Sunday, September 17, 2023", "text": "It was sixty years ago that the running began. On September 17 1963 the classic show The Fugitive debuted on ABC. The show starred David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, who had been wrongfully convicted of his wife's murder. While he was being shipped to death row, the train carrying him derailed and he managed to escape. Dr. Kimble then went on the run, all the while searching for the one-armed man who had really killed his wife. Pursuing him was Stafford Police Lt. Phillip Gerard, an officer dedicated to the enforcement of the law. The Fugitive was created by Roy Huggins, who had earlier created such classic shows as Cheyenne, Maverick, and 77 Sunset Strip while at Warner Bros. In 1960 he left Warner Bros. to become vice president in charge of television production at 20th Century Fox. It was while he was still at Warner Bros. that he began thinking about how to adapt a Western such as Cheyenne and Maverick to modern times. Both of those show dealt with heroes (Cheyenne Bodie and various members of the Maverick family) who wandered the Old West. According to Roy Huggins in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, \"I wanted to have a hero who behaved like a Western hero--who was totally free, had no permanent residence or commitments, no responsibilities.\" It was then that he came up with the idea of a hero who is wrongfully convicted of a crime and must then go on the run, wandering the United States much like Cheyenne and the Mavericks. Much of the inspiration for The Fugitive came from Victor Hugo's novel  Les Misérables, in which the novel's hero Jean Valjean must go on the run. Like Jean Valjean before him, Dr. David Kimble also assumed numerous aliases and help people he met along the way. Producer Quinn Martin would bring The Fugitive even closer to  Les Misérables. Roy Huggins had merely wanted to create a show in which, in his words from the aforementioned interview with The Los Angeles Times, the hero \"...was in trouble the moment he got up from bed every day.\" It was Quinn Martin who turned The Fugitive into a show on which a good part of it was centred on a chase, as Lt. Gerard pursued Dr. Kimble. Just as Lt. Gerard pursued Richard Kimble on The Fugitive, so too did police inspector Javert pursue Jean Valjean in Les Misérables.Over the years it it has often been thought that The Fugitive was based in part on the real-life case of Dr. Sam Sheppard. Dr. Sheppard had been convicted of bludgeoning his wife to death in 1954. Dr. Sheppard not only denied the crime, but claimed that he had chased a \"bushy haired man\" from the house. Two witnesses also said that had seen a bushy haired man near the Sheppards' house that day. Initially found guilty of the crime, Dr. Sheppard was found not guilty by a jury in a retrial in 1966. A 1997 DNA test as part of a lawsuit brought by his son in an effort to absolve his father of the murder. The DNA test proved Dr. Sheppard had not murdered his wife. While the similarities between the Sam Sheppard case and The Fugitive seem considerable. Roy Huggins also denied that it played in any role in the inspiration for The Fugitive.While Roy Huggins thought the had a great idea in The Fugitive, he initially had trouble interesting anyone in the concept. He showed it to fellow writer Howard Browne, with whom he had worked on such shows as Cheyenne and Maverick. Much to Roy Huggins's surprise, Howard Browne thought it was a terrible idea for a show. Undeterred, Roy Huggins showed it to his agent. He showed it to his agent, who had nearly the same reaction that Howard Browne had.  After he had taken the position at 20th Century Fox, Peter Levathes, then in charge of 20th CEntury Fox's television division, asked Roy Huggins for any ideas he had for television shows. He told him his idea for The Fugitive. In the biography Roy Huggins: Maverick, 77 Sunset Strip, and and The Rockford Files by Paul Green, Roy Huggins said, \"When I finished he sat in stricken silence, staring at me as if I had just turned rancid before his very eyes.\"It was while Roy Huggins was still at 20th Century Fox that he received a call from Burt Nodella, who was the executive in charge of development at the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The two had become friends when Roy Huggins was still at Warner Bros., whose shows were aired by the network. Burt Nodella asked Roy Huggins to pitch some idea for TV shows for ABC. He then found himself in a Beverly Hills Hotel suite pitching the idea for The Fugitive to eight ABC executives. The ABC executive sat in silence after Roy Huggins finished his presentation, then let him know that they thought it was a bad idea. Fortunately, Leonard Goldensen, the head of ABC, was also present at the meeting. The various executives turned to him to see what he had to say. Mr. Goldensen loved the idea, stating \"You know, Roy, that is the best f***ing idea I have hard for a television series in my life. When do you want to go to work.\"At the time Roy Huggins could not produce The Fugitive as he was in graduate school, but he was willing to license the show to ABC and have someone else produce it. ABC had a contract with Quinn Martin, who had produced the network's hit series The Untouchables. As to Roy Huggins, he would receive credit as the show's creator and as a result royalties, and a percentage of the profits, and he would retain the book rights, stage rights, and film rights.Cast in the role of Dr. Richard Kimble was David Janssen, who had earlier starred on the show Richard Diamond, Private Detective. Barry Morse was cast as Lt. Gerard. He had previously appeared in various film roles and made guest appearance on television, as well as starring on the CBC show Presenting Barry Morse. The One-Armed Man, later identified as Fred Johnson in the show's series finale, was played by Bill Raisch. The One-Armed Man was actually seen very rarely on the show and ultimately only appeared in ten episodes. William Conrad served as the show's narrator, explaining at the start of each episode how Richard Kimble was wrongfully convicted and how he escaped from a derailed train taking him to death row.Beyond Dr. Kimble, Lt. Gerard and the One-Armed Man, there were only a few recurring characters. Jacqueline Scott appeared as Richard Kimble's sister, Donna Taft, in four episodes. Her husband, Leonard Taft, appeared in three episodes, played by a different actor each time. Lt. Gerard's superior at the Stafford, Indiana Police Department Captain Carpenter (Paul Birch), appeared in 13 episodes. Richard Kimble's late wife, Helen, appeared in flashbacks in three episodes, played by Diane Brewster in all but the episode \"Ballad for a Ghost,\" where she was played by Janis Paige. Lt Gerard's wife, Marie, also appeared in three episodes, played by a different actress each time.With Richard Kimble never staying put and travelling place to place, The Fugitive quite naturally featured several big name guest stars. In the episode \"\"Never Stop Running,\" Claude Akins played kidnapper Ralph Simmons. In \"The One That Got Away,\" Charles Bronson played a police officer. In that same episode, Anne Francis appeared as Felice Greer, the wife of a man who had stolen $250,000 years ago. In \"Death is the Door Prize,' Ossie Davis played Johnny Gaines, a retired police officer accused of murder. In \"The Homecoming,\" Gloria Grahame and Shirley Knight played a stepmother and stepdaughter who are fighting. Several actors made multiple appearances on The Fugitive, playing different characters each time. Among them were Richard Anderson, Ed Asner, Ed Begley, Harold Gould, Dabbs Greer, Pat Hingle, Ted Knight, Suzanne Pleshette, Barbara Rush, and yet others.Despite the many naysayers Roy Huggins encountered in trying to get The Fugitive on the air, it proved to be a hit. In its first season it ranked no. 28 in the Nielsen ratings for the year, extremely high for then struggling ABC. In its second season it did even better, ranking no. 5 for the year. It still ranked a respectable no. 34 for its third season. Ratings for The Fugitive dropped in its fourth season, although no. 50 for the year was still quite good for a show in the 1966-1967 season. The Fugitive also received positive reviews. It won the Emmy Award for Best Dramatic Series in 1966. It as also nominated for five other Emmy Awards.By the fourth season of The Fugitive, David Jansen had grown weary of the show's demanding shooting schedule and also wanted a movie career. It was then that ABC announced in the winter of 1967 that the fourth season would the last season of The Fugitive. While The Fugitive remains famous for its series finale, the time as series finale was not a foregone conclusion. Many of the executives at ABC thought viewers had no interest in seeing Richard Kimble's story come to an end. Leonard Goldberg, then vice president of programming at ABC, argues that the show's fans were indeed emotionally invested in Richard Kimble's plight. They would want to know how his situation was resolved. Of major concern was how a definitive conclusion to the show might affect its chances in syndication. Ultimately, producer Quinn Martin agreed with Leonard Goldberg that the show deserved a proper series finale. It was then that the two part episode, \"The Judgement\" was written by George Eckstein and Michael Zagor. To maximize it ratings, ABC aired \"The Judgement\" during the last two weeks of August. It was in \"The Judgement\" that the One-Armed Man is finally apprehended and Lt. Gerard at last realizes that Richard Kimble was innocent all along. While \"The Judgement: Part I\" did well in the rating, \"The Judgement: Part II\" did phenomenally well in the Neilsens. It was viewed by 72% of the television viewing audience, an estimated audience of 78 million people. It even broke the record previously held by the first appearance of The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Shows. Here it must stressed that The Fugitive was not the first American show to have a series finale. The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp had a series finale that took place over the course of several episodes. Both Route 66 and Leave It to Beaver had series finales before The Fugitive. Concerns that the series finale would have an adverse effect on the show in syndication proved to unwarranted. It had a successful run as a syndicated rerun on local television stations. Later it aired on A&E, TV Land, and Decades. The 1993 movie The Fugitive, starring Harrison Ford, drew inspiration from the show. In 2000 a remake of the show, also titled The Fugitive, had a short run on CBS. In 2020 there was another new show titled The Fugitive, although when an entirely new character on the run. It ran on the short-lived streaming platform Quibi. Sixty years after its debut, The Fugitive remains one of the most famous and most successful shows of all time. Much of it had to has to be due to the basic premise of the show, one in which a wrongly convicted man must go on the run to prove his innocent. It is a premise that is automatically filled with suspense. In many ways The Fugitive  was also a very sophisticated show. On any other show Lt. Gerard may have been presented as a base villain. On The Fugitive he was presented as a good man whose duty was simply to enforce the laws. Throughout its various episodes The Fugitive featured complex characters among the many people Richard Kimble helped. The Fugitive was not simply an action-adventure show, nor was it simply a drama. It truly transcended genres. It is perhaps because of this that The Fugitive remains popular to this day."},
{"title": "The Short, But Spectacular Career of Freddie Prinze", "date": "Friday, September 15, 2023", "text": "Freddie Prinze remains best remembered for the classic sitcom Chico and the Man. It seems likely that he would be remembered much more had his life been longer. He was extraordinarily talented, and one can only guess at what he may have achieved beyond his hit show.Freddie Prinze was born Frederick Karl Pruetzel on June 22 1954 in New York City. His father was a German immigrant who had migrated to the United States in 1934. His mother was Puerto Rican. As a child he had difficulty gaining and retaining weight, so his mother enrolled him in ballet classes. He attended  the High School of Performing Arts where he continued to study ballet and take drama classes. It was while he was attending the High School of Performing Arts that he discovered his talent for stand-up comedy. He dropped out of school in his senior year to become a stand-up comedian.Freddie Prinze worked at various comedy clubs around New York City, among them Catch a Rising Star and The Improv. It was during this period that he adopted \"Freddie Prinze\" as his stage name. It was in December 1973 that his star really began to rise, with appearances on The Tonight Starring Johnny Carson, Jack Paar Tonite, and The Merv Griffin Show. In June 1974 he appeared on The Midnight Special.It was in 1974 that he was cast as Chico Rodriguez on the situation comedy Chico and the Man. The show starred Freddie Prinze as Chico, a young Mexican who went to work for elderly garage owner Ed Brown (Jack Albertson), referred to by Chico as \"the Man.\" Ed Brown's garage was located in a Chicano neighbourhood in East Los Angeles, making it the very first show in the United States to set in a Mexican American community. Following the top-rated Sanford and Son on Friday night, Chico and the Man proved to be a hit, ranking no. 3 in the Nielsen ratings during its first season. The show continued to do well in its second and third seasons as well.While Freddie Prinze was appearing on Chico and the Man, he continued to appear on variety shows on talk shows as well. He appeared on such shows and television specials as Tonight Starring Johnny Carson, The Mike Douglas Show, The Dean Martin Comedy World, The Flip Wilson Special, The Smothers Brothers Show, Cher, American Bandstand, Sammy and Company, The Rich Little Show, Dinah!, Tony Orlando and Dawn, Van Dyke and Company, and various Dean Martin Roasts. He also appeared on the game shows The $25,000 Pyramid and The Hollywood Squares. In 1976 he appeared in the TV movie The Million Dollar Rip-Off, playing an electronics expert named Muff Kovak who masterminds a transit heist. It was also at this time that his comedy album, Looking Good, was released. Sadly, Freddie Prinze had coped with depression his entire life. His depression would intensify after his wife filed for divorce. On January 29 1977 he talked on the phone with his wife. His manager, Marvin \"Dusty\" Snyder, visited him later and it was during that visit that Mr. Prinze pointed a gun to his own head and shot himself. At the time Freddie Prinze's death was ruled a suicide, although in a lawsuit against the Crown Life Insurance Company by his mother, wife, and son, his death was ruled as being accidental and medication induced. There was later  $1 million settlement out of court against his psychiatrist and doctor to end a malpractice suit alleging that they allowed Freddie Prinze to buy a gun and overprescribed him the sedative Quaalude.Freddie Prinze was in many ways a pioneer in American television. While today we might debate a Puerto Rican playing a Mexican on a sitcom, at the time Chico and the Man was the only regularly scheduled show on which Latinos appeared and possibly the first since the cancellation of the classic Western The High Chaparral in 1971. What is more, he was great as the character. NBC appreciated him enough that they signed him to a five year contract at $6 million. Had Freddie Prinze not died so young, it seems fairly certain that his career may have well reached even greater heights."},
{"title": "\"Back to Black\" by Amy Winehouse", "date": "Thursday, September 14, 2023", "text": "Today Amy Winehouse would have turned 40. Sadly, she died on July 23 2011 at the age of 27. She was an extremely talented singer and songwriter whose music drew from the girl groups of the Sixties, rhythm and blues, soul, and jazz. Her biggest hit in the United States was \"Rehab,\" but my favourite Amy Winehouse song has always been \"Back to Black,\" from the album of the same name. While it remains one of Amy Winehouse's best known tracks, it did not even reach the Billboard Hot 100.The lyrics drew upon Amy Wineehouse's failed relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil. He had left her for an ex-girlfriend. Musically, \"Back to Black\" drew upon the sound of the girl groups of the Sixties, particularly The Shangri-Las.\" As far as I am concerned, it remains one of her most powerful songs."},
{"title": "NBC Follies: A Long Forgotten Variety Show", "date": "Wednesday, September 13, 2023", "text": "The Seventies were not a good time for variety shows. While several aired during the decade, hits were few and far between. Many aired only for a matter of months, and, in some cases, weeks. One of the variety shows in the Seventies that did not last long was NBC Follies, which debuted fifty years ago today.NBC Follies originated with John Hamlin, then NBC's vice president of nighttime programming. Although often described as drawing inspiration from vaudeville, it would be more accurate to say that it was inspired by such Broadway revues as George White's Scandals, Earl Carroll's Vanities, and, the most famous of them all, the Ziegfeld Follies. The show even included a bevy of showgirls who would perform throughout the show. Indeed, it was from Ziegfeld Follies that NBC Follies took its name. Sammy Davis Jr. is also often described as the show's regular host and Mickey Rooney as a part-time host, but it would be more accurate to describe them as the stars of Ziegfeld Follies. Neither of them introduced acts or sketches, but they did sing and perform in sketches. NBC Follies first aired as a television special on February 8 1973. In addition to Sammy Davis Jr. and Mickey Rooney, that special also featured John Davidson, Andy Griffith, and Connie Stevens. That special proved successful enough that NBC added NBC Follies to its fall schedule. Like the initial special,  the regular run of  NBC Follies  would feature some fairly big name guests. In addition to Sammy Davis Jr. and Mickey Rooney, the first episode featured Diahann Carroll, Jerry Lewis, and the Smothers Brothers. Further episodes featured such stars as Michael Landon, Milton Berle, Jack Cassidy, Don Addams, Richard Crenna, Ernest Borgnine, and Peter Lawford. The announcer on the show was Johnny Olson, the long-time announcer of such shows as To Tell the Truth, What's My Line?, Match Game, and The Price is Right.Not only were the guests on the show at the top of their professions, but so too were the writers. Howard Albrecht had written for The Jonathan Winters Show and The Bobby Darin Show. George Foster had written for The Perry Como Show, The Bing Crosby Show, and The Garry Moore Show. Among Jack Raymond's credits were Mister Peepers, Petticoat Junction, and The Andy Griffith Show. Sol Weinstein wrote for The Jerry Lester Show and The Bobby Darin Show. The show's musical director and composer of its theme, \"It's Follies Time,\" was also of note. Harper MacKay had composed the scores for such movies as Alice Through the Looking Glass (1966) and Cry Uncle (1971). On television he had serves as the music director or music supervisor on such TV specials as The Julie Andrews Show and Portrait of Petula.The initial reviews for NBC Follies were positive enough. Variety appreciated that the show had a good pace and praised Sammy Davis Jr. and Mickey Rooney, although the publication expressed doubts that the show could succeed on a weekly basis. The New York Times referred to NBC Follies as \"pleasantly and attractively entertaining.\" That having been said, The New York Times had changed its tune by November 18 1973. In the article \"A TV Season That Died,\" the paper referred to NBC Follies as \"...the worst variety program to ever have aborted in prime time.\"With largely positive reviews in the beginning, it must have seemed to NBC that NBC Follies was poised for success. After all, each week featured big name stars and it aired on Thursday night at 10:00, following Ironside. It was the time slot formerly occupied by the hit Dean Martin Show, which had moved to Friday night. Unfortunately, the time slot would prove to be less than ideal. It aired opposite The CBS Thursday Night Movie on CBS. In the 1973-1974 season The CBS Thursday Night Movie regularly aired recent hit movies, including Bonnie and Clyde (1967), The Wild Bunch (1969), Bullitt (1968), and The Graduate (1967). The competition on ABC was also stiff. Then in its second season, the crime drama The Streets of San Francisco would rank no. 22 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1973-1974 season. Between The CBS Thursday Night Movie on CBS and Streets of San Francisco on ABC, NBC Follies found itself trounced in the ratings. In November NBC tried to give the show a boost by changing its title to Sammy Davis Jr. Starring in NBC Follies, to no avail. NBC Follies continued to do badly in the ratings and NBC ultimately cancelled the show. The last episode aired on December 27 1973. NBC Follies didn't even survive into 1974. Today NBC Follies is largely forgotten except by television historians and fans of Sammy Davis Jr. and Mickey Rooney. The initial special is available on YouTube, but only in black and white, and the debut episode is available on YouTube as well, but other than that it is not available on streaming. Given it only lasted 13 episodes, it is doubtful it ever will appear on any streaming platforms. Regardless, NBC Follies is worth remembering, if only as one of the many novelties to air on network television in the Seventies and the only real attempt to bring a revue similar to Ziegfeld Follies to television."},
{"title": "It Turns Out Threads Isn't Much of a Twitter Killer", "date": "Tuesday, September 12, 2023", "text": "When Threads launched on July 5 2023, many media outlets referred to it as a \"Twitter killer.\" I had some serious doubts about this, as there were too many things about Threads that I figured most users would not like, such as the lack of a reverse chronological feed, lack of a web interface, the inability to use hashtags, and the fact that one has to have an Instagram to even use it, among other things. Now I do have to note that Meta (the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads) have corrected many of these things. Regardless, it seems my doubts about Threads being a \"Twitter killer\" have proven to be correct.Threads started out seeming as if it would be a roaring success. By July 7, two days after its launch, it had 44 million daily active users. Unfortunately for Meta, according to data from marketing intelligence company Sensor Tower, Threads ended July with only 8 million daily active users. That is a drop of about 82%. This can be contrasted to Twitter (which owner Elon Musk recently rebranded to \"X\"), which has 249 million daily active users as of this month according to Apptopia. As unhappy as people are with Twitter (I refuse to call it \"X\") under Elon Musk, it would seem that they don't care much for Threads either.As to why Threads experienced such a massive drop in daily active users, I have to think part of it is that it did not have a reverse chronological feed. While Threads began rolling out a reverse chronological feed (called \"Following\") in late July, it may have been too little, too late for many users. In my experience most people looking for a microblogging service, such as Twitter or Mastodon, want their feeds in reverse chronological order. They do not want their feeds dictated by an algorithm. Twitter has an algorithm dictated feed (called \"For You\"), but I don't know anyone who actually uses it. Many users who joined Threads may have stopped using the service as soon as they realized it didn't have a reverse chronological feed.Another objection many users may have had to Threads is the lack of a web interface. While Threads recently added a web interface in late August, again, it may have been a case of too little, too late. Now I don't know how many people prefer using microblogging services on the web as opposed to using them on a phone app, but I think enough people prefer using mircroblogging services on the web to make a difference. While I might check my various microblogging services on my phone, I much prefer to do any actual posting on the web. Again, many users may have given up on Threads when they realized there was no way to access it on the web. While Threads has a reverse chronological feed now and a web interface as well, according to reports I have read recently, one still cannot use hashtags on the service. Supposedly, the ability to use hashtags is one of those features that will eventually come to Threads, but many users may not want to wait that long. Hashtags can be found on virtually every other microblogging service, and even Facebook and Instagram (curiously, both apps are also put out by Meta). Users have been using hashtags for years. They may have deserted Threads when they realized they could not use hashtags on the service.As if losing a huge number of daily active users in less than a month weren't bad enough, there are also some things about Threads that might discourage many potential users from using the app. Chief among these is the fact that one has to have an Instagram account to even use it. One even logs into Threads with their Instagram user name and password. Indeed, Instagram and Threads are so intertwined that if one deletes their Threads account, one's Instagram account is deleted as well, and vice versa. Now I know there are probably many who don't have Instagram accounts, and many of those probably don't want to open one just to use Threads. Another, more serious hurdle for many adopting Threads is, quite simply, privacy concerns. Threads is apparently even more invasive with regards to privacy than even Facebook and Instagram. Threads collects data on users' health and fitness, browsing history, purchases, contacts, and so on. Apparently, Threads is still unavailable in the European Union because it doesn't comply with the EU's regulations regarding privacy. I would think there would be many who would not use Threads precisely because of the privacy concerns. I know it is why I haven't opened a Threads account. While any app knowing my browsing history wouldn't bother me, I see no reason why they should have access to purchases I have made, my contacts, and especially my health. Of course, beyond anything else, much of the reason Threads may have experienced such a precipitous drop in users is simply that there are such a large number of Twitter alternatives out there now. There's Bluesky, Hive Social, Mastodon, Post, Spill, Spoutible, and probably some I haven't even heard of. Many users may have simply tried out Threads and decided they liked another Twitter alternative better instead. Indeed, beyond privacy concerns and objections to Threads's lack of features, another reason I didn't join Threads is that I am already on Spoutible and Mastodon. Indeed, Spoutible has become my favourite social media service of late. In the end, Threads has clearly not turned out to be the \"Twitter killer\" the media, for whatever reason, thought it would be. I think this can be marked up to a number of missteps Meta made along the way, from the initial lack of a reverse chronological feed to the apparently still current inability to use hashtags on the service. Users accustomed to Twitter probably want many of the features that microblogging service has. When a particular microblogging service doesn't have them, they will simply find another microblogging service to use. And, right now, there are plenty to choose from."},
{"title": "The 50th Anniversary of Star Trek: The Animated Series", "date": "Friday, September 8, 2023", "text": "The Saturday morning cartoon Star Trek, now known as Star Trek: The Animated Series, debuted fifty years ago today on NBC, on September 8 1973. Star Trek: The Animated Series was unusual for a Saturday morning cartoon based on a prime time television series in two ways. First, the original show's creator (Gene Roddenberry) served as an executive producer and had near total control over its production. Second,  most of the original cast returned to voice their characters. Another thing that set it apart was the sophistication of its writing, which was such that it would appeal more to teenagers and adults than very young children. Star Trek: The Animated Series was produced in part by Filmation, an animation company that had already made its name with adaptations of DC Comics characters (The Adventures of Superman, The Superman/Aquaman Hour, and so on) and Archie of Archie Comics fame. The origins of Star Trek: The Animated Series go back to 1969, when the original Star Trek was in its third season on NBC. According to Lou Scheimer in the book he co-wrote with Andy Mangels, Lou Scheimer: Creating the Filmation Generation, Filmation worked with Philip Mayer, the director of special programming for Filmation, and animator Don Christensen in developing a proposed animated series. Don Christensen had worked for a variety of animation studios, including Warner Bros., Disney, and DePatie-Freleng. He had written two episodes of Filmation's Saturday morning cartoon Journey to the Center of the Earth in 1967. The proposed series would have seen the original crew of the Enterprise training teenagers aboard a ship called the Excalibur. The new, teenage characters would have included a young Vulcan named Steve, an African American named Bob, a Chinese youth named Stick, and others. In the end, nothing really came of the project.It was in 1972 that Filmation finally made a deal with Paramount to produce an animated Star Trek series (according to Lou Scheimer in Lou Scheimer: Creating the Filmation Generation, Star Trek story editor D. C. Fontana said it was February 14 1972). Star Trek: The Animated Series was guaranteed two seasons with 22 episode spread out over those seasons. At the time Paramount and Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry were not getting along, and the studio could not do it without Mr. Roddenberry's involvement. With Paramount and Gene Roddenberry not getting along at the time, Lou Scheimer found himself talking to the two different parties to make the deal. Ultimately, they reached a deal where Paramount had a third of the series, Gene Roddenberry had a third of the series, and Filmation had a third of the series.The 1972-1973 season had been disastrous for NBC with regards to their Saturday morning line-up. The network wound up cancelling most of their new shows from that season.. Since its cancellation in 1969, Star Trek had proven to be a hit in syndication and had developed a rather sizeable following. Desperate for a hit on Saturday morning, NBC then wanted Star Trek: The Animated Series very badly, so badly that the network allowed Gene Roddenberry, Filmation, and Paramount total creative control over the show. From the beginning, it was decided that Star Trek: The Animated Series would not be a children's show.Gene Roddenberry was not the only person from the original show to work on Star Trek: The Animated Series. Filmation hired D.C. Fontana, who been story editor on the original series, to serve as story editor on Star Trek: The Animated Series. D.C. Fontana convinced many of the writers on the original show to write for the new series. Samuel A. Peeples, who had written the second pilot of Star Trek (\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\") also wrote the first episode of the animated series, \"Beyond the Farthest Star.\" David Gerrold revived a script, \"More Tribbles, More Troubles,\" that was to serve as a sequel to his episode \"The Trouble With Tribbles,\" which had gone unproduced during the original series's third season. Stephen Kandel, creator of con man Harry Mudd, wrote the episode \"Mudd's Passion.\" D.C. Fontana even brought respected science fiction writer Larry Niven on board to write an episode.Most of the original cast also reunited for Star Trek: The Animated Series, although it could have turned out otherwise. To keep costs down, Filmation originally planned to cut the characters of Sulu and Uhura It was Leonard Nimoy, who was returning as Spock, who pointed out that they would be excluding the two minority actors from the show. In Lou Scheimer: Creating the Filmation Generation, Lou Scheimer wrote,\"We were horrified at our unintended slight, made all the worse because we were the one studio who had been championing diversity in its output.\" The character of Ensign Chekov was cut from the show, which meant Walter Koenig would not be part of the series.  Largely due to Leonard Nimoy, Filmation did buy a script from Mr. Koenig, \"The Infinite Vulcan.\"Two new characters would be added to Star Trek: The Animated Series. Lt. Arex, who was voiced by James Doohan, was an Edosian, a tripedal species who took Chekov's place as navigator. Lt. M'ress was a Caitian, a feline humanoid species. She served as a communications officer on the Enterprise. She was voiced by Majel Barrett. Majel Barrett also provided the voice for the ship's computer. Both James Doohan and Majel Barrett would voice various other incidental characters throughout the series.Not only did original regular cast members return from the original series, but Star Trek: The Animated Series also featured guest stars from the original show. Mark Lenard once more played Spock's father Sarek in \"Yesteryear.\" Stanley Adams reprised his role from \"The Trouble with Tribbles,\" Cyrano Jones, in \"More Tribbles, More Troubles.\" Roger C. Carmel returned as con man Harcourt Fenton Mudd in \"Mudd's Passion.\" Star Trek: The Animated Series had a huge budget for a Saturday morning cartoon at the time. It cost $75,000 per episode. While much of the budget went to the cast, a good deal of it also went into the animation. Don Christensen, who had worked on Filmation's earlier proposed Star Trek series, served as art director on the show. Bob Kline, Herb Hazelton, and George Goode, who all worked on other Filmation shows as well, did much of the design work on Star Trek: The Animated Series.Star Trek: The Animated Series did not use the theme Alexander Courage had written for the original series. Instead, it used a theme credited to Yvette Blais and Jeff Michael, but was actually written entirely by Filmation's resident composer Ray Ellis. He used the pseudonym \"Yvette Blais\"due to problems with royalties, while \"Jeff Michael\" was producer and Filmation co-founder Norm Prescott, who received a cut of the royalties for all music composed for Filmation productions. According to Star Trek writer David Gerrold, the original theme was not used due to a disagreement between Alexander Courage and Gene Roddenberry. Mr. Roddenberry had added lyrics to the original theme, which effectively cut Mr. Courage's residuals for it in half. Star Trek: The Animated Series debuted on September 8 1973. By total coincidence, this was the date that Star Trek: The Original Series debuted in 1966. The show was well received by critics. It won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment Children's Show in both 1974 and 1975. Star Trek: The Animated Series did relatively well in the ratings with regards to teenagers and adults. Unfortunately, it did not do particularly well with younger children, the audience that mattered the most to advertisers with regards to Saturday morning television in the Seventies. Star Trek: The Animated Series would be cancelled following its second season.At the time it should not have been surprising that Star Trek would be revived as a Saturday morning cartoon. During the 1973-1974 season there was a cycle which saw the debuts of several cartoons based on prime time, live action shows. Lassie's Rescue Rangers was inspired by both the Lassie movies and the long running TV show. My Favorite Martians (which, like Star Trek, was produced by Filmation) was based on the classic sitcom My Favorite Martian. Jeannie was very loosely based on the classic sitcom  I Dream of Jeannie. Emergency +4 was based on Emergency!, which was then still on the air. Given this cycle towards Saturday morning cartoons based on prime time shows, it would have perhaps been more surprising if Star Trek has not been adapted as a Saturday morning cartoon. Star Trek: The Animated Series would not produce a lot in the way of merchandising. Filmation sold animation cels of the series. A series of novelizations of the show's episodes by Alan Dean Foster would also be published under the title Star Trek Logs. A public service announcement for the non-profit group Keep America Beautiful was produced featuring voices of the cast and animation by Filmation. It aired on Saturday mornings while Star Trek: The Animated Series was on the air.While Star Trek: The Animated Series was well-loved by many fans, it was following the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation that Gene Roddenberry decided Star Trek: The Animated Series was no longer canon. David Gerrold placed much of the blame for Star Trek: The Animated Series no longer being canon on Richard Arnold, a research consultant Mr. Roddenberry appointed \"Star Trek archivist. Regardless, even after Gene Roddenberry decided it was no longer canon., Star Trek: The Animated Series introduced several concepts that would continue to be accepted  It was first on Star Trek: The Animated Series that it was established that James Kirk's middle initial, \"T,\" stands for \"Tiberius.\" The episode \"The Practical Joker\" introduced what would be known as the Holodeck on Star Trek: The Next Generation and subsequent Star Trek shows, but was called a \"Rec Room\" in the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode.  The Vulcan city ShiKahr, which first appeared in the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \"Yesteryear,\" also became an established part of Star Trek lore.Since the death of Gene Roddenberry in 1991 and Richard Arnold's departure, it would seem that Star Trek: The Animated Series, or at least most of the show, is once more regarded as canon. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine made several references to the animated series. In the episode \"Once More into the Breech,\" Klingon officer Kor refers to his ship as the Klothos, the same name it had in the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \"Time Trap.\" The episode \"Broken Link\" includes a reference to Edosians (Arex's species). When the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \"The Ultimate Computer\" was remastered, the ship Woden was redone as a grain carrier of the sort that appeared in the animated series's episode \"More Tribbles, More Troubles.\" The character of Robert April, a recurring character on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, first appeared on Star Trek: The Animated Episode in \"The Counter-Clock Incident.\"Perhaps no show has made as much use of concepts from Star Trek: The Animated Series as its fellow animated series, Star Trek: Lower Decks. Indeed, the chief medical officer on the Cerritos, T'Ana, is a Caitian just as M'Ress was. The episode \"\"Kayshon, His Eyes Open\" includes the skeleton of the giant clone of Spock from the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \"The Infinite Vulcan.\" The show has also featured an Edosian. The aforementioned instances are not the only times concepts from Star Trek: The Animated Series have appeared in subsequent Star Trek projects. Regardless of whether Star Trek: The Animated Series is canon or not, the show would have a lasting impact. It was the first new Star Trek project since the cancellation of the original series, six years before the release of Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). In this respect, it kept the franchise alive at a time when a live-action Star Trek project seemed unlikely. Perhaps more importantly, Star Trek: The Animated Series would lead to the creation of new Star Trek fans. Prior to Star Trek: The Animated Series, I had seen the occasional Star Trek rerun on those rare days when we could pick up the television stations from St. Louis and Kanas City, so that Star Trek: The Animated Series was my first prolonged exposure to the franchise. By the time the show had ended, I was hooked. When KRCG in Jefferson City started rerunning the original series on Saturday nights, I was already a Star Trek fan. I am sure I am not alone in my experience, and that there are others who became Star Trek fans because of the animated series. Star Trek: The Animated Series was hardly perfect. Being a Saturday morning cartoon, the animation could be extremely limited. The occasional error crept through to finished episodes. That having been said, the backgrounds on the show could be amazing and the scripts were top notch. In particular, \"Yesteryear,\" by D.C. Fontana, ranks among the best episodes of any Star Trek series in my book. For much of its history, Star Trek: The Animated Series has been overlooked among the shows in the franchise. It is time that it was recognised for the remarkable achievement it was."},
{"title": "\"Better By You, Better Than Me\" by Spooky Tooth", "date": "Thursday, September 7, 2023", "text": "Many of the obituaries following Gary Wright's recent death focused primarily upon his solo career, particularly his hit single \"Dream Weaver.\" What these obituaries overlooked was his work with Spooky Tooth many years earlier. The songs Gary Wright wrote or co-wrote for Spooky Tooth feature the same poeticism found in his later solo work. Possibly my favourite Spooky Tooth song is \"Better By You, Better Than Me.\" The song appears on Spooky Tooth's second album, Spooky Two, released in March 1969. \"Better By Me, Better Than You\" would later be covered by Judas Priest in 1978. It was released as a single and appeared on their album Stained Class. It was in 1985, during the moral panic over backmasking that Judas Priest's cover of the song was at the centre of a lawsuit alleging that two teenagers killed themselves due to subliminal messages on the song. The case was eventually dismissed the case, with the judge stating that the \"...plaintiffs lost this case because they failed to prove that defendants intentionally placed subliminal messages on the album and that those messages were a cause of the suicide.\"In addition to Judas Priest, \"Better By Me, Better Than You\" was also covered by Armageddon in 1970, Gunhill in 19975 and Blues Karloff in 2014."},
{"title": "Gary Wright Passes On", "date": "Wednesday, September 6, 2023", "text": "Gary Wright, the singer, songwriter, and keyboardist known for his work both with the band Spooky Tooth and as a solo artist, died on September 4 2023 at the age of 80. Gary Wright was born on April 26 1943 in Cresskill, New Jersey. As a child actor he appeared on television on the TV show Captain Video and His Video Rangers. He also appeared in TV and radio commercials. In 1954 he appeared on Broadway in a production of the play Fanny. He studied both piano and organ. While attending Tenafly High School in Tenafly, New Jersey, he was a member of various rock bands. It was in 1959 that he made his first professional recording along with Billy Markle as the duo Gary & Billy. The single \"Working After School\" was released in 1960, but did not chart. Concerned about the instability of a music career, Gary Wright decided to become a physician. He studied medicine at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, then New York University and Downstate Medical College in Brooklyn. He went to the Free University of Berlin in West Germany to complete his medical studies. The whole time he continued to play in bands. It was while he was in Berlin that he toured with a band called The New York Times. The New York Times was touring with Traffic when Gary Wright met Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records, the label to which Traffic belonged. Chris Blackwell persuaded Gary Wright to go to London. It was in London that Gary Wright formed Spooky Tooth with  pianist Mike Harrison and drummer Mike Kellie. Spooky Tooth was signed to Island Records and their first album, It's All About, was released in June 1968. Their second and third albums, Spooky Two and Ceremony, were released the following year. Gary Wright left Spooky Tooth following Ceremony.It was in 1970 that he signed with A&M Records to pursue a solo career. His first solo album, Extraction, was released that same year. Gary Wright also performed on George Harrison's solo album, All Things Must Pass. It was following his second solo album that Gary Wright reformed Spooky Tooth with Mike Harrison. Gary Wright would record three albums with the newly formed Spooky Tooth, You Broke My Heart So I Busted Your Jaw, Witness, and The Mirror. Gary Wright and Mike Harrison also worked on the duo Splinter's debut album The Place I Love. Following the break-up of Spooky Tooth, Gary Wright signed with Warner Bros. Records as a solo artist and recorded the album The Dream Weaver. The album proved to be a hit and peaked at no. 7 on the Billboard album chart. The single \"Dream Weaver\" from the album went to no. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single \"Love is Alive,\" from the same album, also went to no. 2 on the chart. His next album, The Light of Smiles, peaked at no. 23 on the Billboard album chart. In total, Gary Wright released twelve studio albums from 1970 to 2010. His 1979 single \"Really Wanna Know You\" went to no. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100.Gary Wright also wrote soundtracks for films, including Benjamin (1972), Endanger Species (1982), and Feuer und Eis (1986). He reunited with Spooky Tooth in 2004 and their DVD/CD Normal Poets--Live in Germany was released in 2007. In 2008 he toured with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.  He joined up with Spooky Tooth in 2009 for a series of concerts in London celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Island Records. He toured again with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band in 2010 and 2011. Gary Wright was a very talented songwriter. While best known for his hit \"Dream Weaver,\" he composed many other songs that would have a lasting impact. Some of the songs he wrote for Spooky Tooth, such as \"Sunshine Help Me,\" \"That Was Only Yesterday,\" and \"Better By You, Better Than Me,\" would be covered by other artists. His solo hits \"Dream Weaver,\" \"Love is Alive,\" and \"Really Wanna Know You\" remain popular to this day. He was also one of the most gifted keyboardists in rock music. He could play multiple styles, ranging from bluesy piano to more classical sounding keyboards. He was also among the first rock artists to use a portable keyboard, utilising the instrument as early as the mid-Seventies. As if being a talented keyboardist wasn't enough, Gary Wright also had a powerful voice. His vocals could be by turns dreamy or soulful. Gary Wright was an incredible talent, and he will continue to have an influence on rock music for years and years to come."},

{"title": "The 5th Anniversary of the Death of Vanessa Marquez", "date": "Wednesday, August 30, 2023", "text": "Vanessa Marquez \"But what is grief if not love persevering?\" (The Vision in the WandaVision episode \"Previously On\")At 2:36 PM Pacific Time it will have been five years since actress Vanessa Marquez died. On August 30 2018 she was shot in the back by South Pasadena, California police officers Gilberto Carrillo and Christopher Perez. Ever since she has been mourned by her family, her friends, and her fans. For me it remains the absolute worst day of my life. I am still suffering from trauma from that day, and I still have trouble remembering details from that day.The plain truth is that Vanessa Marquez was a very special woman. She was a well-known actress who had starred in the classic movie Stand and Deliver (1988) and the hit television show ER. Her other credits included the cult movies Twenty Bucks (1993) and Blood In Blood Out (1993), and the TV shows Wiseguy and Culture Clash. Vanessa was a sweet, warm, loving, intelligent, talented, and beautiful woman who cared deeply for her friends and other people. She was a huge fan of classic movies and adored Audrey Hepburn. She was well-known for her love of Star Wars and had a huge collection of Star Wars memorabilia. I first encountered Vanessa on Twitter where we were both original members of TCMParty, the loosely organized group of fans who live tweet films shown on Turner Classic Movies. At the same time we also lived tweeted the TV shows Downton Abbey and Mad Men. Vanessa and I soon learned we had a lot in common, including a love of Star Wars, Star Trek, The X-Files, classic movies, classic television shows, and so on. Eventually we would be in touch very nearly every day, through social media, texts, and phone calls. I will not speak as to how Vanessa felt about me, although I know she regarded me as a dear friend, but for my part I fell in love with her. I loved Vanessa more than anyone else in my live.It was on August 30 2018 that I called Vanessa as usual. When I didn't get an answer, I figured she must be asleep and so I texted her. She replied to me right away and said that she was having severe seizures. She asked me to call for paramedics, which I did. Unfortunately, police officers were also dispatched to her apartment. Once there those police officers behaved in a most inappropriate and unprofessional manner, and Gilberto Carrillo decided to place a 5150 hold on Vanessa. From there things escalated and ultimately the police officers shot Vanessa in the back. She died at 2:36 PM at Huntington Memorial Hospital. Knowing Vanessa as well as I did, it is my firm belief that she was no danger to herself or others and I know for a fact that she was not suicidal. She was simply a woman in need of treatment for seizures. A 5150 hold was entirely unwarranted. I also remain convinced that had I been in Vanessa's apartment that day, the police officers present in her home would have shot me or anyone else there. Nothing will convince me otherwise. (For more on Vanessa's death, read my post \"Justice for Vanessa Marquez\"). The afternoon of August 30 2018 I had to go to work at our local historical society's museum. I worried about Vanessa the whole time I was there and when I got home I texted her. When I received no reply, I assumed that they must have taken Vanessa to hospital. Still worried about her, I ran a search on the internet to see if there was any news. At 8:00 PM Central Time I learned that there had been an officer involved shooting involving a 49 year old woman at the address of Vanessa's apartment. At that point I began to panic. It was at 11:00 PM Central Time that I learned that Vanessa Marquez had been shot and killed by police. I gave some of our local friends the sad news and then posted the news of her death to both Facebook and Twitter.I also broke down crying. I went to bed, but I never got to sleep. I simply lay in bed crying non-stop. I even considered taking my own life in the early hours of August 31. I didn't as I realized I had to remain alive to get justice for Vanessa and preserve her legacy. I also realized that Vanessa would be very angry with me if I took my own life (note--I do believe in an afterlife). Ultimately, I would not stop crying until 1:00 PM, Friday, August 31 2018. I also stopped eating. I ate nothing that Friday nor did I eat anything on Saturday. In fact, I wouldn't eat anything until Sunday evening. I would cry every single day that September, usually multiple times. In the coming months I would not cry every single day, but I would cry often and many times the tears just seemed to come out of nowhere. To this day there are still times I will break down crying.So much has happened since Vanessa's death. Two memorials were held for her. One by various friends in September 2018 and one by her friends and cast members from the movie Stand and Deliver (1988) in October 2018. Her Stand and Deliver cast mate Lydia Nicole started a petition to have Vanessa Marquez included in both SAG and the Academy Awards' on-air In Memoriam segments. Neither SAG nor the Academy did, but the petition reached 12,000 signatures. Ultimately, I think this said more than if Vanessa had been included in either SAG  or the Academy's on-air In Memoriam segments. People loved Vanessa Marquez and enjoyed her many performances over the year. It was in 2019 that I went to California to scatter Vanessa's ashes at the Hollywood Sign with her mother and her Stand and Deliver cast mates Patrick Baca and Daniel Villareal. It was an emotional experience and marked the first time I broke down crying in front of anyone who was not immediate kin. It was in February 2021 that Vanessa's mother reached a settlement with the City of South Pasadena in a wrongful death lawsuit. It was in October 2018 that director Cyndy Fujikawa conceived a documentary on Vanessa's career and tragic death. That documentary, Ninety Minutes Later, has since been completed and made its premiere at the SAFILM-San Antonio Film Festival earlier this month.Sadly, Vanessa's case is not an isolated one. Latinos are shot by police at a rate disproportionate to their population in the United States. Between 2014 and May 2021, 2600 Latinos were killed by police. And while, contrary to much of what has been reported, the police were not there to make a \"welfare check\" on Vanessa (I called paramedics to treat her for seizures), many welfare checks also end in police officers killing the very people they were sent to check on. From 2019 to 2021, 178 welfare checks ended in an officer involved shooting. Here I must point out that while the vast majority of individuals killed by police are men, there have been many women who have been shot by police as well. In 2018 alone 53 women were shot by police. What makes Vanessa's case remarkable is that unlike many officer involved shootings of Latinos, as well as those people killed during welfare checks, is that it received national media coverage. No officer involved shootings of Latinos have received the sort of media coverage that the murder of George Floyd did, let alone the sort of media coverage that Vanessa's murder did. One of the most difficult things I have had to deal with in the wake of Vanessa's death is that, like many Americans, I was raised to trust and respect police officers. I come from a family where many of my kinfolk have served in law enforcement and I have friends who are police officers. When officers from the South Pasadena Police Department shot Vanessa in the back and killed her, it then felt like a betrayal. After having lived with this case for five years and having examined the facts in the case, from the autopsy report to small portions of the bodycam video (I cannot bring myself to watch all of it) to the Complaint for Damages filed on behalf of Vanessa's mother, I still believe that the two officers who shot Vanessa behaved in a manner most unbefitting for police officers and used excessive force in dealing with her. To this day I am convinced that both of the police officers who shot and killed Vanessa belong in prison. I certainly would not trust either of them with my life or anyone else's. Five years later I am still mourning Vanessa Marquez, as are many others. As I said earlier, Vanessa was a very special woman. She had many friends and, like me, those friends are still grieving her to this day. She also had many fans who were saddened to learn of her death. Vanessa was much more than a talented actress who appeared in a classic movie and the number one show of its day. She was an intelligent, warm, caring, loving woman with a great sense of humour who was swift to take up for her friends and genuinely cared for other people. For me she will always remain the one person I love above all others, even my immediate family. I know I will miss her until the day I die."},

It was in 1992 that she originated the role of Harley Quinn on Batman: The Animated Series. Arleen Sorkin had attended college with Batman: The Animated Series co-developer and writer Paul Dini. Paul Dini was inspired to create Harley Quinn one day when he was sick home from work and watching Days of Our Lives. In that particular episode Arleen Sorkin, playing Calliope Jones, appeared in a dream sequence dressed as a harlequin. PAul Dini based the character largely on Miss Sorkin herself, even down to her mannerisms. Harley first appeared in the episode \"Joker's Favour\" and was meant to appear only once. As it turned out, the character proved to be a hit and appeared eight more times on Batman: The Animated Series. Arleen Sorkin would further voice Harley on the shows Superman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, Gotham Girls, Static Shock, and Justice League. She also voiced Harley Quinn in the video games The Adventures of Batman and Robin, Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, Batman: Vengeance, Batman: Arkham Asylum, DC Universe Online, and DC Universe Online: The Last Laugh. She played Harley Quinn in the movies The Batman Superman Movie: World's Finest and Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. In the Nineties Arleen Sorkin guest starred on the show Ted & Venus. She appeared in the TV movie Perry Mason: The Case of the Killer Kiss. She was a guest voice on the animated series Taz-Mania. She provided a voice for the animated film Batman:Mask of the Phantasm (1993). she appeared in the movies Oscar (1991) and I Don't Buy Kisses Anymore (1992). In the Naughts she returned to Days of Our Lives for brief times as Calliope Jones. She guest starred on Frasier. She played Miss Q in Comic Book: The Movie. Sadly, by the Teens, Miss Sorkin's health no longer allowed her to pursue her career.Arleen Sorkin was also a writer. She wrote a 1991 episode of the show Down Home. She also wrote episodes of Tiny Toon Adventures and an unsold pilot How to Marry a Billionaire. She co-created the show Fired Up with Paul Slansky. She wrote the story for the 1997 movie Picture Perfect.Arleen Sorkin was a wonderful actress. So much was her impact as Calliope Jones on Days of Our Lives that people like me who didn't watch soap operas were aware of both her and her character. If Harley Quinn proved to be so popular that she not only continued to appear in various DC television and movie projects, as well as become part of the comic books, it is largely because of her performance as the role. Every actress who has played Harley Quinn ever since has drawn upon Arleen Sorkin's performance for inspiration. In Perry Mason: Case of the Killer Kiss, she played an expert on soap operas who assists Perry's investigator Ken Malansky on a murder case. In the final episode of Frasier she played the owner of a monkey.Arleen Sorkin had a wonderful gift for playing off the wall characters. In some ways she was a throwback to the bubbly, but wisecracking blondes of the Golden Age of Hollywood. While some soap opera actors remain best known for the soap operas on which they appeared, Arleen Sorkin will be remembered for so much more."},
{"title": "The 30th Anniversary of Father Hood (1993)", "date": "Sunday, August 27, 2023", "text": "Father Hood (1993) is not among Patrick Swayze's best known movies. It certainly is not among his most successful, nor is it a favourite with critics. For myself, it is notable as one of the feature films in which my dearest friend Vanessa Marquez has a part. It was thirty years ago today, on August 27 1993, that Father Hood was released. in Los Angeles.In Father Hood Patrick Swayze plays petty crook Jack Charles. His daughter had been in foster care, but was ultimately sent to the fictional Bigelow Hall in Los Angeles, a corrupt and downright abusive state-run home. When his daughter Kelly (Sabrina Lloyd) escapes from Bigelow, she goes straight to her father and tells him that his son Eddie (Brian Bonsall) is being sent there. It is when it becomes apparent to Jack that Bigelow is indeed corrupt and abusive that he rescues his son and a pregnant teen named Delores (Vanessa Marquez). After returning Delores to her family, Jack and his children begin a trek across country.Father Hood originated with a series of articles written on child care homes for New York magazine by Nick Pileggi. Mr. Pileggi based the idea for the movie on a real-life incident in which a father abducted his children from an abusive child care home. South African director Darrell Roodt signed on to the production along with producers Gillian Gorfil and Anant Singh, with whom he had worked in South Africa. Gillian Gorfil and Darrell Roodt were developing another film at the time, but put that movie on hold in anticipation of making their first American film. According to Anant Singh in his autobiography In Black and White: A Memoir, the producers and director Darrell Roodt had initially been promised that Richard Gere would star. Ultimately, the script would turn out entirely different from what it had originally been and the producers actually had little control over the project. Ultimately, Patrick Swayze was cast as the film's lead. Mr. Swayze was arguably still at the height of his career, with such hits as Ghost (1990) and Point Break (1991) to his credit. The film would go through a number of titles before it was released, among them Desperado, Jack of Hearts, and Honour Among Thieves. Ultimately it was titled Father Hood.Principal photography on Father Hood began on November 16 1992 in Helotes, Texas, a small town outside of San Antonio. Father Hood would literally be shot across the country, at such locations as Hoover Dam, New Orleans, some Louisiana bayous, the Valley of Fire state park in Nevada. According to Patrick Swayze in the biography he wrote with his wife Lisa Niemi, he was drinking more than he ever had while working on Father Hood. One morning the crew even had difficulty waking him up. It was while he was making the movie that Mr. Swayze realized he had a problem. After shooting ended on Father Hood, he checked himself into a treatment centre in Tucson, Arizona.Vanessa Marquez in Father Hood (1993)While according to Patrick Swayze, he was drunk much of the time that he was making Father Hood,  Vanessa Marquez said he was one of the nicest people with whom she ever worked. Vanessa simply adored him. Vanessa's part in Father Hood is a small one, and she only appears for a few minutes in the movie. Still, she gives a fairly good performance for the time that she is on screen. Curiously, Father Hood is one of two times that Vanessa played a pregnant character, the other being the 1991 TV movie Locked Up: A Mother's Rage. Given Vanessa was never pregnant, she did a remarkably good job of playing characters who were. Patrick Swayze's co-star in Father Hood was Halle Berry, who was fresh off such films as The Last Boy Scout (1991) and Boomerang (1992). She played journalist Kathleen Mercer, who helps Jack bring down Bigelow Hall. The role was significant for Miss Berry in that it was one of the first in which her race did not play a role in the film. Halle Berry did have some objections to the way that Hollywood Pictures promoted the film leading up  to its release. Quite simply, Hollywood Pictures hinted at a romance between Jack and Kathleen in the film, when in actuality their relationship in the movie is strictly platonic.Father Hood was released to overwhelmingly negative reviews. Michael Wilmington of The Los Angeles Times wrote of the film, \"Father Hood works on pure travelogue level.\" One of the few positive reviews came from Roger Ebert, who gave Father Hood a thumbs up and opened his review with \"Father Hood is a genial, simple minded chase picture in which a smalltime thief learns to love his children. I didn't believe a single second of it, although I enjoyed a few of them.\" Audiences didn't seem to take to Father Hood either. It only made $3.4 million at the box office, a remarkable failure given Patrick Swayze was at that time a guaranteed box office draw.Of course, for me it is understandable why neither critics nor audiences took to Father Hood. In many ways the film has a split personality. It cannot make up its mind whether its a chase movie, an action movie, or a family comedy. The plot is rather slim and tends to be formulaic. The dialogue is often not very convincing. The viewer doesn't get an idea of the characters' inner lives. Even so, Father Hood does have a few things to recommend it. Particularly given the material they had to work with, much of the cast gives fairly good performances. Diane Ladd is great as Jack's mother Rita, a small time grifter who has seen better days. Halle Berry does a fairly good job in portraying Kathleen Mercer, a remarkable feat given there was little to her character. And, of course, as I mentioned above, Vanessa Marquez gives a solid performance given the brief amount of time she is on screen. Besides the performances, another reason Father Hood may not be a total waste of time is Mark Vicente's cinematography. Michael Wilmington is right to a degree in his review in The Los Angeles Times--Father Hood does work to a degree as a travelogue. There are wonderful shorts of the Hoover Dam, the Louisiana bayous, and the open road.Father Hood certainly is not a good movie, although I question whether it is quite as bad as some critics think it is. If one is going to watch it at all, they should probably go in not expecting much and with a willingness to suspend disbelief. At any rate, there are some good performances in the film and there is some beautiful scenery as well."},
{"title": "The Late, Great Bob Barker", "date": "Saturday, August 26, 2023", "text": "Bob Barker, the long-time host of classic game shows Truth or Consequences and The Price is Right, died today at the age of 99. Bob Barker was born on December 12 1923 in Darrington, Washington. He spent much of his childhood on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in Mission, South Dakota. After his father died, his mother moved to Springfield, Missouri. There he attended high school and Drury College. In 1943, during World War II, he joined the United States Naval Reserve to serve as a fighter pilot, although he was never placed on active duty. He graduated from Drury in 1947. It was while he was still in college that he got a job at radio station KTTS in Springfield where he read news and sports. He then got a job at WWPG in Palm Beach, Florida. From Florida he moved to California, where he hosted The Bob Barker Show on a Burbank radio station. Ralph Edwards, creator and producer of  the radio show and game show Truth and Consequences, discovered Bob Barker when Mr Barker was hosting an audience participation show on radio show KNX in Los Angeles. He hired him to replace Jack Bailey as the host of Truth or Consequences. Bob Barker remained the host of Truth or Consequences until the original television version ended in 1975.In the Sixties Bob Barker was also the host of Dream Girl of '67 in addition to Truth or Consequences. He also began a long stint of hosting the annual Miss Universe pageant in 1967. He also appeared on the shows Here's Hollywood, I'll Bet, Today, The Family Game, You Don't Say, The Mike Douglas Show, The Woody Woodbury Show, The Ed Nelson Show, and Philbin's People. It was in the Seventies that Bob Barker began his long stint host of The New Price is Right. He hosted the show from its debut on CBS in 1972 to 2007. He also continued to host Truth or Consequences. He also appeared on the shows The Pet Set, The Jerry Lewis MDA Labour Day Telethon, It's Your Bet, I've Got a Secret, Tattletales, The Cross-Wits, The Paul Ryan Show, The Jim Nabors Show, Match Game '73, Dinah!, and That's My Line.In the Eighties Bob Barker continued to host The Price is Right. He appeared on such shows as The Tomorrow Show, The John Davidson Show, The New Hollywood Squares, and The Arsenio Hall Show. He hosted the Tournament of Roses Parade and continued to host the Miss Universe Pageant. In the Nineties he continued to host The Price is Right and appeared on the shows One on One with John Tesh, The Chuck Woolery Show, Family Feud,m Vicki!, The Suzanne Somers Show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Bailey Kipper's P.O.V., The Maury Povich Show, and The Rosie O'Donnell Show.In the Naughts he continued to host The Price is Right and appeared on the shows The Wayne Brady Show, The Reichen Show, The Tyra Banks Show, The Early Show, Square Off, Ellen: The Ellen Degeneres Show, Late Night with David Letterman, Larry King Live, The Bonnie Hunt Show, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and WWE Monday Night RAW. In the Teens he appeared on The Bold and the Beautiful and, Stu's Show. He appeared on The Price is Right one last time in 2015.Bob Barker also appeared as an actor, often playing himself, on the TV shows Bonanza, The Nanny, Something So Right, Martial Law, Futurama, Yes Dear, How I Met Your Mother, Family Guy, and SpongeBob Squarepants and the movie Happy Gilmore (1996).To say Bob Barker was a legend may be something of an understatement. He was very much part of the fabric of the daily lives of Americans in the mid to late 20th Century. Many Gen Xers and Zoomers have memories of spending days when they were sick and home from school, propped up by 7Up (or Sprit or ginger ale) and crackers, watching The Price is Right. For myself, I remember coming home from school and watching Truth or Consequences. For a time during the Seventies I would see Bob Barker twice a day, once in the morning on The Price is Right and again on Truth or Consequences. He certainly had longevity on American television. It seems to me that the length of his TV career may only be matched by Betty White. If Bob Barker was able to remain a game show host for so long, it is perhaps because he was ideal for the job. He had plenty of charm and a mischievous streak, and he was able to put people at ease, even in the often unusual situations in which people found themselves on Truth or Consequences. He also had plenty of patience, perhaps a necessary trait when getting mauled by contestants on The Price is Right.Of course, he devotion to animal rights must also be noted. He always ended The Price is Right with a reminder of people to spay and neuter their pets. He supported such groups as  United Activists for Animal Rights, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.. In 1994 he founded the DJ&T Foundation, devoted to funding animal-neutering programs and funding animal shelters. Many of us will always remember Bob Barker as a comforting presence, someone who was always there for us when we were sick and home for school. He was also a marvellous host who had a way of putting everyone at ease."},
{"title": "a.k.a. Pablo", "date": "Friday, August 25, 2023", "text": "It is a sad fact of life that for the first several decades of American broadcast television, Chicanos were largely absent from the screen. It would not be until 1974, with the debut of Chico and the Man, that there would be a show centred on a Mexican character and set in a Mexican American neighbourhood. Following Chico and the Man, it would not be until the debut of a.k.a. Pablo on ABC that there would be another show focused on a character of Mexican American descent. Unfortunately, it would prove to be a disappointment.The failure of a.k.a. Pablo is particularly notable given some of the creative talent involved. It was the first sitcom produced by the legendary Norman Lear since One Day at a Time (although he had served as executive producer on other shows). It was created by Norman Lear and Rick Mitz, who later created the short-lived show Hi, Honey, I'm Home. Its star was Mexican American comedian Paul Rodriguez. Norman Lear had discovered Paul Rodriguez when he was doing warm-up for television show audiences. The show would draw a bit from Mr. Rodriguez's life.On a.k.a. Pablo Paul Rodriguez played Pablo Rivera, who performs as a stand-up comic using the name Pablo Rivera. Pablo had a large Mexican American family, some of who were played by some fairly big names. His father, Domingo, was played by Joe Santos, perhaps best known for playing Sgt. Dennis Becker on The Rockford Files. His mother was played by none other than the legendary Mexican actress Katy Jurado, who had appeared in such films as High Noon (1952) and Broken Lance (1954).  Héctor Elizondo played Pablo's fast-talking agent José. a.k.a. Pablo got off to a strong start. It even best The A-Team (then ranked no. 6 in the ratings for the year) in Los Angeles and Chicago. Unfortunately, its ratings would ultimately prove to be abysmal. Much of the reason for the low ratings was probably the fact that the show received an overly negative reaction from Mexican Americans due to what they viewed as stereotypes. a.k.a. Pablo premiered on ABC on March 6 1984 and ended its run after only six episodes, on April 10 1984. Today a.k.a. Pablo is largely forgotten. When the show is mentioned, it is generally in a negative light. In 2002, on the occasion of the magazine's 50th anniversary, TV Guide even ranked it at no. 45 in its list of the 50 worst shows of all time. It perhaps stands as a cautionary tale of how not to produce a sitcom centred on Chicanos. Fortunately, things would improve since a.k.a. Pablo, with the debuts of the sketch comedy show Culture Clash in 1993 (which, unlike a.k.a. Pablo was written and produced by Chicanos) and the drama American Family in 2002.  If anything else, a.k.a. Pablo remains a reminder of when Mexican American representation was nearly non-existent on television and when Mexican American characters did appear they were apt to be stereotypes."},
{"title": "Old Network Promos for New Fall TV Shows", "date": "Thursday, August 24, 2023", "text": "Although it might be hard for Zoomers to believe, there was a time when there was genuine excitement for the new fall television season on the networks. Promos for new shows often started airing as early as July and would continue through August right up the debut of the new shows in September and October. Here are three promos for classic shows from the past.This is the first ever promo for the now legendary show Star Trek. It is notable for two reasons. First, it feature the now famous promotional artwork created by James Bama. Today James Bama may be best known for the covers he painted for the reprints of the Doc Savage novels published by Bantam and the artwork on the boxes of Aurora's classic Universal Monster model kits, but he also created promotional art for television shows. Second, the promo is notable for giving the wrong premiere date for Star Trek. The show would actually debut on September 8 1966 rather than September 15 1966, as a part of a special preview of the show. Tarzan, starring Ron Ely, debuted the same night as part of a special preview Designing Women debuted twenty years after Star Trek in 1986. This promo is a bit more sophisticated than the first Star Trek promo, as we get to hear from the actual characters on the show.This is an early fall promo for ER. It is notable that it starts off by mentioning Hill Street Blues and L.A. Law, two critically acclaimed NBC shows. ER would receive its share of critical acclaim. It would also become the most successful drama of the Nineties. It ultimately lasted 15 seasons.One fall promo I wanted to share here was one of the notorious fall promos for the 2002 television series Firefly. Quite simply, the early promos totally mischaracterized the show.  Indeed, it mischaracterized the show's characters. The show's main character, Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), was described as a \"whacked out space cowboy.\" Wash (Alan Tudyk), the pilot of the ship Serenity on the show, was described as a \"flighty pilot.\" Inara (Morena Baccarin) was called a \"cosmic hooker.\" All of this was set to \"Walkin' by the Sun\" by Smash Mouth and even featured record scratching of the sort known for rap. It seemed as if Fox was trying to promote Firefly as some sort of off the wall space comedy rather than a serious, often dark sci-fi Western.The past several years I don't remember seeing that many promos for new fall shows. In fact, the only one I think I have seen the past week is one for The Irrational, starring Jesse L. Martin, on NBC. This wouldn't have been the case in the past. There was a time when by this time of year I would have seen literally dozens of promos for new fall shows. It would seem that the influence of the networks have truly declined and that more and more they are giving way to streaming services."},
{"title": "Tuxes by Scott Fivelson", "date": "Wednesday, August 23, 2023", "text": "With billionaires who inherited their wealth constantly making news these days, the novel Tuxes by Scott Fivelson may be more relevant now than when it was first published in 2007. The novel sends up the mega-rich through its portrayal of the Bundleworth family and their conglomerate, Tuxaco, the biggest renter and seller of tuxedos in the world. Based in Bundleworth, Texas (part of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Bundleworth metroplex), Tuxaco has outlets in 48 of the 50 states and very nearly every country in the world.With Tuxes, Scott Fivelson casts a wide net, satirizing not only the rich, the State of Texas, the formalwear industry, and corporate America, but the class system, counterculture, and American entertainment, among other things. In many ways the novel is reminiscent of such Sixties satirical movies as Dr. Strangelove (1964), The Loved One (1967), and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1967), taking aim at multiple targets and showing little in the way of mercy towards any of them. Indeed, in Tuxes the same traits that would make for a successful caveman are the same traits that would make for a successful corporate executive.What makes Tuxes successful as a satire is that its characters, while exaggerated, are so convincing that readers can easily believe they are real. At the centre of it all is Bundleworth patriarch Price, who finds his life turned upside down. And while Price is arguably the central character in Tuxes, his family, employees, and yet other characters have their own hopes and dreams. Much of the humour in Tuxes comes from how the characters’ hopes and dreams succeed or fail often for reasons that are sometimes downright preposterous. In Tuxes the characters are often not the captains of their fates so much as they are merely passengers aboard a ship in an at times stormy sea.Kevn Costner as JohnDutton III in YellowstoneOf course, all of this would be for naught if Tuxes was not a very funny novel. Scott Fivelson has a sharp wit so that while the events in Tuxes might be exaggerated, they reflect what often happens in the real world. As to the plot of Tuxes, there is never a slow moment. The novel moves at a good clip and has enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested.Tuxes is a clever book that evokes such primetime soap operas centred on wealthy families as Dallas and Dynasty, and quite currently, the Yellowstone/Taylor Sheridan Universe, while at the same time evoking such satirical movies as Dr. Strangelove and The Loved One. Ultimately it is a fun read that will keep any reader thoroughly entertained."},
{"title": "Congressman Joaquin Castro Nominates 27 Latino Movies for the National Film Registry", "date": "Tuesday, August 22, 2023", "text": "The National Film Registry is a collection of movies selected for preservation in the Library of Congress by the United States National Film Preservation Board. Over the years many classic movies, from Casablanca (1942) to When Harry Met Sally (1989) have been added to the National Film Registry. Sadly, beyond such classics as Stand and Deliver (1989) and Selena (1997), few Latino movies have been added to the registry. Joaquin Castro, the Representative for Texas's 20th district, is seeking to change that. He has nominated 27 Latino films to be included in the National Film Registry.Some of my favourite movies number among those that Representative Castro nominated for the registry. Among them are My Family (1995), Frida (2002), Walkout (2006), The Milagro Beanfield War (1988), and Up in Smoke (1978). My dearest Vanessa Marquez appears in one of the films nominated. She played Montana's daughter in Blood In Blood Out (1993). If Blood In Blood Out is accepted, it will make two of her movies that are in the National Film Registry. Stand and Deliver was inducted into the registry in 2011.Joaquin Castro included a wide array of Latino classics among his nominations. I can think of only one movie he could have included, but did not. The Ring (1952) was among the earliest movies to centre on Chicanos and quite possibly the first to acknowledge the segregation that existed in Los Angeles in the Fifties. It was a well done and even powerful film that really should be included in the National Film Registry. Regardless, I am hoping that several of Joaquin Castro's nominations will find their way into the National Film Registry. Many of them should have been inducted years ago."},
{"title": "A Quick Review of Spectrum Choice", "date": "Monday, August 21, 2023", "text": "Last month I posted about how the siblings and I would be dropping our then current cable package in favour of Spectrum's new live-streaming service, Spectrum Choice. Well, we recently made the change. I am happy with it and the siblings seem to be too.For those of you unfamiliar with Spectrum Choice (which I would have to think is most of you), it automatically gives one their local channels and then one can choose 15 additional channels. Now one is somewhat limited in which channels one can choose. That having been said, the choices include nearly all of the most popular channels, including Turner Classic Movies (which is the one cable channel I must have).  The downside is that INSP is not among the choices (at least in our area), and I missing it. Even so, Spectrum Choice is much cheaper than the standard cable package and we are not paying for channels we never watch (*cough* Fox \"News\" *cough*). As to the interface of the Spectrum app, it is fairly user friendly. One can get to the channels one wants to watch fairly quickly,  as well as On Demand. It is fairly intuitive, so that one does not have to spend a lot of time figuring out how to navigate the app. As to the quality of the picture, my sister is convinced it is better than what we had with the old cable package. Anyway, I am happy with Spectrum Choice and if you are a Spectrum customer it might be worth your while to switch to it. I honestly don't miss our old cable package, particularly given we would have lost TCM. And it is nice to have a much lower bill."},
{"title": "The 50th Anniversary of Enter the Dragon", "date": "Saturday, August 19, 2023", "text": "It was fifty years ago today, on August 19 1973, that Enter the Dragon was released in the United States. Coming out only a little under a month following the death of its star, Bruce Lee, Ultimately Enter the Dragon would gross an estimated $400 million worldwide. It may well still be the most famous martial arts movie ever made.It was in 1973 that the United States was swept up in a kung fu craze. That year King Boxer (retitled Five Fingers of Death for its American release) topped the box office in the spring of that year. Soon other Hong Kong kung fu movies were also topping the box office charts, so that on the box office chart for May 16 1973 in Variety no less three kung fu movies were at the top of the chart. At no. 1 on the chart was The Big Boss (retitled Fists of Fury in the United States), starring Bruce Lee, who was then probably best known as Kato on the TV series The Green Hornet. While the king fu craze began in 1973, work on what would become Enter the Dragon had begun earlier. Producer Fred Weintraub was convinced that there was a market for martial arts films made in the United States. He persuaded Warner Bros. to finance a martial arts films and also brought in Bruce Lee's production company, Concord. Warner Bros. signed a deal with Golden Harvest to distribute the film. Golden Harvest had been founded in 1970 and had begun to rival the Shaw Brothers in producing kung fu movies. Enter the Dragon would be the first kung fu movie in history to be produced by a Hollywood studio.Michael Allin, who would later work on the movies Truck Turner (1974) and Flash Gordon (1980), was hired to write the screenplay for what was initially called Blood and Steel. Robert Clouse was hired to direct the film. He had earlier Darker Than Amber (1970) and Dreams of Glass (1970). As to casting, Robert Clouse had wanted Rod Taylor to play the character of Roper, a down on his luck gambler and martial artist. It was Bruce Lee who decided against Rod Taylor playing Roper, thinking that he was too tall for the role. It was then that John Saxon was cast as Roper. John Saxon was already trained in the martial arts, having a black belt in Judo and Shotokan Karate.  In the role of Williams Rockne Tarkington, who had guest starred on such TV shows as The Andy Griffith Show and Tarzan, was originally cast. It was only days before production was set to start that he dropped out of the movie. Jim Kelly was then cast in the role. He was trained in Okinawan karate and had won several karate championships. Williams in Enter the Dragon would be his breakout role and would soon become an action star.Enter the Dragon was shot on location in Hong Kong. The opening scenes were shot on Baker Street in Hong Kong. Other scenes were shot at Aberdeen Harbour in Aberdeen, Hong Kong and at Tai Tam Bay in Hong Kong.  Several scenes were shot at Golden Harvest Studio. Some shooting was done in Los Angeles as well. By Hollywood standards Enter the Dragon was a B-movie. It cost only $850,000 to make.While Enter the Dragon only had a production budget of $850,000, its marketing budget was over $1 million. The movie was heavily publicized months before its release, with such major publications as Esquire, Newsweek, Time, and The Wall Street Journal covering the movie. Its promotion kit included photos, cards, a flip book, a comic book, t-shirts, posters, and more.Sadly, Bruce Lee would never see the premiere of Enter the Dragon. It was on July 20 1973 that he died of brain oedema at the age of 32. The world premiere of Enter the Dragon in Hong Kong was six days later, on July 26 1973. The North American premiere of Enter the Dragon was on August 17 1973 in New York City. Once the film expanded to the rest of the country in September, it topped Variety's box office chart for two weeks and stayed in the top ten of the box office charts for the next four weeks. It was in October, in its eighth week of release in the United States, that it once more went to number one. Ultimately, it grossed  $25,000,000 in its initial American release.While Enter the Dragon was a success at the box office, it initially received mixed reviews. According to Variety at the time, there was only one favourable review and four unfavourable reviews of the film among New York City critics. There were critics who recognized that Enter the Dragon was something special, as both Variety and The New York Times gave it favourable reviews.As proven by the box office, audiences certainly loved Enter the Dragon. It seems possible that much of this was due to the death of Bruce Lee, already a popular star with fans of king fu cinema in the United States. Just as James Dean's death may well have spurred the success of Rebel Without a Cause (1955), it seems possible that Bruce Lee's death spurred the success of Enter the Dragon. It also seems possible that the kung fu craze, although it had faded somewhat from its height earlier in the year, also helped Enter the Dragon at the box office. Ultimately, it would seem that most of its success was due to audiences recognizing something that some critics did not. Quite simply, Enter the Dragon was a good movie.Enter the Dragon was a blend of various genres, combining kung fu with tropes from spy movies and even the concurrent Blaxploitation movies. This made it seem starkly original at the time. Its script featured plenty of action, giving Bruce Lee and the other stars plenty of chances to show off their skills in the martial arts. Even the actors' performances were solid, particularly that of John Saxon as Roper. Enter the Dragon stood out even from other kung fu movies of the time, let alone other action movies of the time.Enter the Dragon would have a lasting influence. While Bruce Lee was already well known in the United States at the time of its release, Enter the Dragon insured he would be remembered as a star. It would have an impact not only on further kung fu movies, but action movies in general. Movies from the two Kill Bill movies to The Matrix to the John Wick movies show its influence upon them. It would even have an influence on anime. Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama was a huge fan of Enter the Dragon. If many action heroes from Batman to John Wick utilize a blend of martial arts, much of it is due to Enter the Dragon."},

They were influenced by  British Invasion bands, surf music, and the rhythm and blues artists of the era, as well as traditional Mexican music. As to the unusual spelling of their name, they adopted the spelling \"Thee Midniters\" to avoid being sued by an earlier R&B group, The Midnighters from the 1950s and early 1960s, now best known for launching the career of Hank Ballard.Thee Midniters recorded several singles from 1965 to 1967. Their cover of \"Land of a Thousand Dances\"peaked at no. 67 on the Billboard Hot 100 and no 27 on the Canadian singles chart. They were particularly notable for recording songs with Chicano themes. Their fourth single was the instrumental \"Whittier Blvd.,\" named for one of the main thoroughfares in East Los Angeles. Their penultimate single was \"The Ballad of Cesar Chavez,\" dedicated to the Mexican American labour leader. Their final single was \"Chicano Power.\" If it was not the first rock song in which the word \"Chicano\" appeared in the title, it was definitely among the first."},
{"title": "Why Vanessa Marquez Deserves a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame", "date": "Wednesday, August 16, 2023", "text": "Two weeks from today, on August 30 2023, it will have been five years since the death of my beloved Vanessa Marquez.  Vanessa was an actress best known for playing Ana Delgado in the classic movie Stand and Deliver (1988) and Nurse Wendy Goldman on the classic television series ER. I have long thought that Vanessa Marquez deserves a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and I think it is now time to try to get her one.I am sure most of you know what the Hollywood Walk of Fame is, but for those who don't, it is s series of five-pointed terrazzo and brass stars in the sidewalks along fifteen blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks of Vine Street in Hollywood, California. While the Hollywood Walk of Fame is best known for the stars featuring the names of actors, there are also stars for directors, producers, musicians, and others involved in the entertainment industry. The stars are awarded for achievements in the entertainment industry in one of six categories: Motion Pictures, Television, Radio, Recording, Live Theatre/Performance, and Sports Entertainment. Vanessa worked in three of those categories: Motion Pictures, Television, and Live Theatre/Performance.Of course, there are other criteria that must be fulfilled for someone to get a star along the  Hollywood Walk of Fame. One is professional achievement. I think there can be no doubt that Vanessa Marquez fulfilled this. Indeed, she was a pioneering Chicana actress. She was one of the stars of Stand and Deliver (1988), in which she played high school student Ana Delgado. At the time of the release of Stand and Deliver, most Chicanas on screen were often highly sexualized and often cholas. Often they were played by actresses who weren't even of Mexican American descent. As a quiet, studious, and intelligent girl, Ana was a sharp contrast to these earlier stereotypes. At the time Vanessa was on ER she was one of the few Latinas in a recurring role on television. She also appeared in the cult films Twenty Bucks (1993) and Blood In Blood Out (1993), as well as the TV shows Wiseguy and Culture Clash.Another criterion necessary to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is longevity. That is, one has to have worked in the entertainment industry for at least five years.  Vanessa's film and television career lasted 13 years, from Stand and Deliver in 1988 to the TV movie Fire & Ice in 2001. Her last stage credit was Anna in the Topics in 2010. In the case of deceased actors there is a waiting period of two years. It has been five years since Vanessa's death. Finally, to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame one must have made contributions to the community.  She worked with the United Farm Workers, and knew both Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. On December 7 1989 Vanessa took part in a rally and then a march protesting the exposure of farmers to pesticides used on grapes alongside Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and Martin Sheen. She also did work on behalf of Amnesty International. When Jamie Escalante, the teacher upon whose life Stand and Deliver was based, developed cancer, Vanessa was relentless in helping raise money to help pay for his medical bills. Later in life she volunteered at the Pasadena Humane Society's animal shelter. As if her contributions to film and television were not enough, Vanessa made a number of contributions to her community.While the criteria to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame does  not included how beloved an actor is, Vanessa Marquez was very much a beloved actress. Since her death I have encountered some of her fans, who not only cite her performances in Stand and Deliver and ER, but also in such projects as the TV show Culture Clash and the movies Twenty Bucks and Blood In Blood Out. A petition launched by her Stand and Deliver co-star Lydia Nicole to include Vanessa Marquez in the SAG Awards and Academy Awards on-air In Memoriam segments reached 12,000 signatures. A large number of people loved Vanessa. For them she was not just another actress. She was a star.Vanessa Marquez certainly meets all of the criteria in order to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The one hurdle to Vanessa getting a star on the Walk of Fame is that a  star ceremony costs $75,000, a price that is subject to change (you have to know it won't go down). Most of that money goes to creating and installing the star, as well as maintaining the Walk of Fame itself. $75,000 is a lot of money, but I have a feeling it could be raised with a good deal of hard work. If Vanessa has as many fans as I think she does, I am sure many people would donate money towards getting her a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Vanessa Marquez was an extremely talented actress who cared for her fellow human beings. She gave a number of remarkable performances, many of which were cited in the reviews of the movies and stage plays in which she appeared. As one of the few well-known Chicana actresses in Hollywood in the Nineties, she was certainly a pioneer. While I know many will say I am biased, I think Vanessa more than deserves a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."},
{"title": "The 100th Anniversary of Alice Ghostley's Birth", "date": "Monday, August 14, 2023", "text": "Chances are good that if you are a person of a certain age, you are familiar with character actress Alice Ghostley. A short list of the shows on which she played semi-regular or regular character includes Captain Nice, Mayberry R.F.D., Bewitched, and Designing Women. What is more, she made a large number of guest appearances on television, everything from Car 54, Where Are You? to The Golden Girls. Alice Ghostley was born 100 years ago today, on August 14 1923, in Studio City, California.Alice Ghostley's career dates to the earliest days of American broadcast television, making her television debut on an episode of Lights Out in 1951. She made guest appearances on television shows throughout the Fifties and the early Sixties. She was one of the ugly stepsisters in the 1957 television production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella, and she was a regular on Jackie Gleason's American Scene Magazine from 1962 to 1964. It was in 1967 that she appeared in her first regular role on sitcom, the short-lived Captain Nice.Captain Nice starred William Daniels (later of St. Elsewhere and Boy Meets World), who played mild mannered police chemist Carter Nash, who discovers a formula that grants him superpowers. Alice Ghostley played Carter's domineering mother, who pressures him into using his new discovery to fight crime. Poor Carter wasn't the only one henpecked by Mrs. Nash, as she henpecked his father (played by Byron Foulger), who usually took refuge behind a newspaper. Alice Ghostley was totally convincing in the role, which was made all the more remarkable by the fact that she was hardly old enough to be William Daniels's mother (she was only four years older than William Daniels).Alice Ghostley's next major role was that of the witch Esmerelda on Bewitched. Esmerelada was a sharp contrast to Mrs. Nash on Captain Nice. She was hired by the witch Sam (Elizabeth Montgomery) and her mortal husband Darrin  as a maid and a babysitter for their children Tabitha and Adam. Esmerelda was extremely timid, and apt to fade from view when she was nervous. She was very inept when it came to witchcraft, and her sneezes could come with unexpected results. Debuting as Esmerelda on Bewitched in 1969, her time in the role over lapped with he time as Cousin Alice on Mayberry R.F.D, on which she debuted in 1970. For those unfamiliar with the show, Mayberry R.F.D. was essentially The Andy Griffith Show without Andy Griffith. Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) and his son Opie (Ron Howard) were replaced by farmer Sam Jones (Ken Berry) and his son Mike (Buddy Foster). The rest of the cast of The Andy Griffith Show remained with Mayberry R.F.D., including Frances Bavier as Aunt Bea, who went from being Andy's housekeeper to being Sam's housekeeper. It was following the second season that Frances Bavier retired. She was replaced by Alice Ghostley as Sam's Cousin Alice. Alice had served many years in the United States Army, and reached the rank of Sergeant. When she was discharged from the Army, she visited Sam in Mayberry and wound up staying on as his housekeeper. In many ways Alice was handier to have around that Aunt Bea ever was. Not only could she cook and clean, but she could even repair a car.Bewitched and Mayberry R.F.D. weren't the only classic sitcoms on which Alice Ghostley appeared. She also had a recurring role as Bernice Clifton on Designing Women. Bernice was the best friend of the Sugarbaker sisters' mother, and more than a little eccentric. While she lived in a retirement community, she spent much of her time at the Sugarbaker's interior design firm. Among her eccentricities were sending the Sugarbakers health tips, claiming to have had wild encounters with various men, and entering the various individuals of Sugabaker & Associates in contests. Alice Ghostley was nominated for the 1992 Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Bernice.It is rare for many actors to have regular or semi-regular roles on multiple shows, but Alice Ghostley actually had even more recurring roles on shows than Captain Nice, Bewitched, Mayberry R.F.D., and Designing Women. She also had recurring roles on Temperatures Rising, Small Wonder, Evening Shade, and the soap opera Passions. She also appeared in such feature films as To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), The Graduate (1967), With Six You Get Eggroll (1968), and others. She was extremely prolific as an actress, probably because she was just so very good. As can be seen in the roles mentioned above, she could play a wide variety of characters. She could be a timid soul like Esmerelda, or domineering wife and mother like Mrs. Nash. She could be an efficient housekeeper and handyman like Cousin Alice or an eccentric like Bernice. If Alice Ghostley played such a large variety of roles, it was probably because she was just very good."},
{"title": "Chicano-Chicana Heritage Month", "date": "Saturday, August 12, 2023", "text": "The Chicano Moratorium March of 1970If you're one of those people who keep track of the news, you may have seen where Representative Lou Correa of California reintroduced a resolution that would recognize August as Chicano-Chicana Heritage Month. The resolution is sponsored by more than sixty members of Congress. Representative Correa credits leaders in Orange County, California with bringing the resolution to his attention. A majority of Orange County's population is Hispanic, with the majority of Hispanic people being of Mexican descent. Indeed, of the Latinos in United States, 61.4% of them are Mexican in descent. As to the term \"Chicano,\" it was originally derogatory, but was adopted by Mexican Americans as their own during their fight for civil rights in the Sixties. Representative Lou Correa noted the importance of Hispanic Heritage Month celebrated from September 15 to October 15 each year, but he also said, \"Is the Cuban struggle the same as the Mexican American struggle? Probably not. We have similarities, but it's not the same.\" He noted that Mexican American history is connected to the Southwest, the farmworker movement, fighting for desegregation, and opposition to the Vietnam War. As to why August should be Chicano-Chicana Heritage Month, it on August 29 1970 that a march conducted by the National Chicano Moratorium Committee Against the Vietnam War took place in East Los Angeles. It drew 30,000 individuals. At the time it was the largest action against the Vietnam War ever taken by one ethnicity. Personally, I am all in favour of official recognition of Chicano-Chicana Heritage Month. For one thing, I think the heritages of the various people who make up the United States should each be honoured with a month of their own.  While Hispanic Heritage Month certainly is important, as Representative Correa pointed out, I agree with him that we really need a month dedicated to Mexican American heritage. The term \"Latino\" is rather monolithic, and covers a number of different people with different cultures. For another thing, my dearest friend and a woman I adored, Vanessa Marquez, was a Chicana and very proud of her Mexican heritage. I also have many other close friends who are Mexican Americans and proud of that fact.Over the years I have written several posts that have dealt with Mexican American culture or individual Mexican Americans. In honour of Chicano-Chicana Heritage Month, I then thought I would post links to a few of the posts I have written dealing with movies, music, and TV shows that feature Mexican Americans or Chicano culture.\"The 75th Anniversary of Ritchie Valens's Birth\", May 13 2016\"My Beloved Vanessa Marquez\", August 31 2018\"Stand and Deliver Turned 30\", October 5 2018\"The Waltons Season 8, Episode 23: 'The Medal'\", October 6 2020\"The Ring (1952)\", October 8 2022\"The 30th Anniversary of Blood In Blood Out (1993)\", April 30 2023\"The 80th Anniversary of the Zoot Suit Riots\", June 8 2023\"The 30th Anniversary of the TV Show Culture Clash\", July 31 2013"},

She would become known as the \"Queen of Technicolor\" because of the many Technicolor swashbucklers and Westerns in which she appeared.  A classic beauty with red hair and green eyes, she certainly photographed well in colour. Rhonda Fleming died in 2020 at the age of 97, and I eulogized her on that occasion (you can read my post there). With that in mind, I will leave you with pictures from throughout her career.Rhonda Fleming's first substantial movie role was in Alfred Hitchcock's movie Spellbound (1945). She played Mary Carmichael, a patient at the mental hospital Green Manors. Although Rhonda Fleming is well known for her roles in Technicolor movies, she also appeared in film noirs, including one of the greatest of all time. In Out of the Past (1947) she played Meta Carson, the secretary of Leonard Eels (Ken Niles), a corrupt lawyer in the employ of villain Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). Here she is with Robert Mitchum.The musical comedy A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1949) was one of the Technicolor films in which Rhonda Fleming starred. She played Alisande la Carteloise, the love interest of Hank Martin (Bing Crosby). The Golden Hawk (1952) was one of the Technicolor swashbucklers in which Rhonda Fleming appeared. In the film she played Captain Rouge, a female pirate, a rival of the movie's protagonist, the pirate Kit \"The Hawk\" Gerardo (Sterling Hayden).Rhonda Fleming appeared in several Westerns, among them Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957). She played Laura Denbow, the love interest of Wyatt Earp (Burt Lancaster).Rhonda Fleming's last feature film appearance was in The Nude Bomb (1980), which was very loosely based on the TV series Get Smart (1965-1970). In the film she played Edith Von Secondberg, a fashion designer and the second wife of scientist Nino Salvatori Sebastiani (Vittorio Gassman), an agent of KAOS. Rhonda Fleming went into semi-retirement in 1960, so that she only had a few movie and television credits following that year. She had made a good deal of money through investments in real estate. Her final appearance was in the short \"Waiting for the Wind\" (1991), in which she appeared with her Out of the Past co-star Robert Mitchum."},
{"title": "The Late Great Robbie Robertson", "date": "Wednesday, August 9, 2023", "text": "Robbie Roberson, best known as guitarist and singer in The Band, died today, August 9 2023, at the age of 80 after a lengthy illness. Robbie Robertson was born Jaime Royal Robertson on July 5 1943 in Toronto. His mother, Rosemarie Dolly Chrysler, was  Cayuga and Mohawk, and had been raised on the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario. His biological father, Alexander Klegerman, was Jewish and had been killed in a hit-and-run accident. His mother married James Robertson while still carrying Robbie Robertson. It was while Robbie Robertson was growing up on the Six Nations Reserve that he became interested in music. For two summers as a teenager Robbie Robertson worked for touring carnivals.Robbie Robertson played guitar in high school bands. One of his bandmates in a band called The Suedes joined Ronnie Hawkins's band The Hawks as their keyboardist. Robbie Robertson served as a member of Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks' road crew and later replaced Scott Cushine as the band's bassist. Eventually, Robbie Robertson became The Hawks' lead guitarist. Levon Helm was The Hawks' drummer at the time, and he and Robbie Robertson became close friends. By 1961 The Hawks' line-up would also include  Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and Garth Hudson. This line-up toured with Ronnie Hawkins from 1961 to 1963. They also recorded with Mr. Hawkins on Roulette Records. It was in early 1964 that The Hawks and Ronnie Hawkins parted ways. The group recorded singles as both Levon and The Hawks and The Canadian Squires. Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, and Garth Hudson also played blues artist John Hammond's 1965 album So Many Roads. It was in 1965 that Bob Dylan sought to hire Robbie Robertson as the guitarist for his backing band. Robbie Robertson initially refused Bob Dylan's offer, but did play two shows with Bob Dylan. Robbie Robbie Robertson then suggested that Levon Helm be hired as the band's drummer, and the two performed as part of his backing band. It was in 1967 that Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel, and later Levon Helm gathered at a pink ranch house in Woodstock, New York (dubbed \"Big Pink\" by the group) to work on music for the feature film You Are What You Eat. They also conducted recording sessions with Bob Dylan, both at Mr. Dylan's home in Woodstock and at Big Pink. Eventually the group, at last simply called \"The Band,\" would sign a contract with Capitol Records. Their debut album, Music from Big Pink, was released in July 1968.From 1969 to 1977, The Band would record six more studio albums. They also released several singles, including \"The Weight,' \"Up on Cripple Creek\"/\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\" \"The Shape I'm In,\" and more. The Band decided to take a hiatus, and their farewell concert at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco was filmed by Martin Scorsese and released as the film The Last Waltz in 1978. While The Band would later regroup, for the most part it would be without Robbie Robertson. In 1994 Robbie Robertson played as part of The Band upon the occasion of their induction into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. Even while he was a part of The Band, he did production and session work outside of the group. He produced Jesse Winchester's 1970 debut album. He played guitar on Ringo Starr's 1973 solo album Ringo. He also played on Ringo Starr's 1974 album  Goodnight Vienna. He also played with Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon. Hirth Martinez, Eric Clapton, and Neil Diamond in the Seventies.Robbie Robertson's first, self-titled solo album was released in 1987. It would be followed by five more solo albums, last of which was Sinematic in 2019. From the Eighties to the Nineties he co-produced the Tom Petty and The Heartbrakers song \"The Beat of Everything\" on their album Southern Accents. played on The Call's album Reconciled, and producef the song \"Love in Time\" for Roy Orbison's album King of Hearts (released in 1992 after Mr. Orbison's death). Robbie Robertson also had a considerable career in film. He starred in the 1980 film Carny. He also acted in the film The Crossing Guard (1995). He worked a good deal with Martin Scorsese, serving as the a music producer, music consultant, or music supervisor on the movies The King of Comedy (1982), Casino (1995), Gangs of New York (2002), Shutter Island (2010), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), Silence (2016), and The Irishman (2019). He was the composer on the films The Colour of Money (1986), The Irishman (2019), and the upcoming Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).While Robbie Robertson was a consummate musician, he was strongest as a composer and songwriter. He was essentially a storyteller, with most of his songs telling stories, often firmly entrenched in American and Canadian tradition. He also wrote some of the best soundtracks to Martin Scorsese's films, He certainly had a lasting influence on various music artists, including artists as diverse as The Grateful Dead, Elton John, and George Harrison. Indeed, he is counted as being instrumental in the creation of the music genre known as Americana.  Few music artists had the impact that Robbie Robertson did"},

He graduated from Senn High School in the Edgewater neighbourhood of Chicago. As a teenager he went to the movies often and became interested in the art form. After graduation, in 1953, he responded to an advertisement from a television station for someone to work in their mailroom. As it turned out, he went to the wrong station, WGN, who hired him to work in their mailroom. It was their that Fran Coughlin, writer and columnist, became his mentor. William Friedkin eventually became floor manager at WGN and then director of live television. It was in 1962 that he directed his first television documentary, The People vs. Paul Crump. In the Sixties he directed more television documentaries: The Bold Men, Pro Football: Mayhem on a Sunday Afternoon, and The Thin Blue Line. He also directed episodes of the documentary television series Time-Life Specials: The March of Time. In 1965 he directed an episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, \"Off Season.\" The first feature film he directed, Good Times, was released in 1967. In the late Sixties he went onto direct the films The Birthday Party (1968), The Night They Raided Minsky's (1968), and The Boys in the Band (1970).In the Seventies William Friedkin directed the movies The French Connection (1971), The Exorcist (1973), Sorcerer (1977), The Brink's Job (1978), and Cruising (1980). He also directed the documentary Conversation with Fritz Lang (1975). In the Eighties he directed the movies Deal of the Century (1983), To Live and Die in LA (1985), Rampage (1987), and The Guardian. He directed an episode of the revival of the television series The Twilight Zone, as well as music videos for such artists as Laura Branigan, Wang Chung, and Barbara Streisand. He directed the TV movies C.A.T. Squad and C.A.T. Squad: Python Wolf.In the Nineties he directed the feature films Blue Chips (1994), Jade (1995), and Rules of Engagement. He directed episodes of Tales from the Crypt and Rebel Highway, as well as the TV movie 12 Angry Men. In the Naughts he directed the movies The Hunted (2003) and Bug (2006). He directed the documentary short \"The Painter's Voice\" and two episodes of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. In the Teens he directed the movie Killer Joe (2011) and the documentary The Devil and Father Amorth (2017). His final film, an adaptation of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial, is set to premiere at the Venice Film Festival in September.William Friedkin also wrote much of what he directed, including the TV documentary The Thin Blue Line, the feature film Cruising, the feature film To Live and Die in LA, the feature film Rampage, the feature film The Guardian, and the documentary short \"The Devil and Father Amorth.\" He had cameos in the Wang Chung video \"To Live and Die in LA\" and the movie Without Limits (1998). He was a guest voice on The Simpsons in 2017.William Friedkin was an incredible director, with gift for visuals. Indeed, he sometimes took risks in his attempts to capture his creative vision. What is more, he treated genre films with the same seriousness that another director might treat a drama. In another director's hands The French Connection would have been a mere action film and The Exorcist a mere horror movie. In Mr. Friedkin's hands they were considerably more. While William Friedkin may be best known for The French Connection and The Exorcist, he was nothing if not versatile. Good Times was a comedy musical starring Sonny & Cher. The Night They Raided Minsky's was another musical comedy. He followed these films with The Boys in the Band, one of the first dramas to feature mostly gay characters. And while he is best known for his feature films, throughout his career, he directed documentaries throughout his career. In the end, William Friedkin was one of the greatest directors of the late 20th Century."},
{"title": "A Few Suggestions for Streaming Services", "date": "Saturday, August 5, 2023", "text": "In 2006 Amazon launched Amazon Unbox, a streaming service renamed Amazon on Demand in 2008 and currently known as Prime Video. In 2007 Netflix, originally a DVD-by-mail company, launched its streaming service. It's for that reason I have been using various streaming service since around 2008. What is more, I am always subscribed to at least one streaming service, usually more. Having used streaming services for around 15 years and having used them quite a lot, I have then given thought to how they could be better. Here, then, are a few suggestions for streaming services on how they could improve things.Allow Users: to Disable Autoplay: I am sure everyone is familiar with the concept of autoplay on streaming services, whereby the next episode of a television show begins playing as soon as the previous episode ends. While this feature may be handy for those who binge watch shows and don't want to constantly be hitting the \"play\" button, for those of who prefer to watch one episode at a time it is a petty annoyance. Now some streaming services do allow users to disable autoplay. Hulu, Max, and Paramount+ all have a place in their settings where users can disable it. Unfortunately, others do not. Tubi has no way to disable autoplay, so that one has to quickly hit the \"back\" button before it goes onto the next episode. Amazon is even worse. It will start a countdown measured in seconds in the middle of the closing credits and one has to be quick on the \"back\" button to stop it from going onto the next episode. As far as I am concerned, all streaming services should have a way to disable autoplay. It is the one feature I hate the most in streaming services.Give Users a \"Not Interested\" Button for Recommendations: A long time ago Netflix had a \"not interested\" button, whereby users could simply dismiss recommendations they weren't interested in. Unfortunately, Netflix did a way with the \"not interested\" button years ago and, insofar as I know, have never restored it. Quite frankly, I think every streaming service should have a \"not interested\" button. David Zaslav will probably hate me for this, but I will never watch 90 Day Fiancé or any of TLC's other \"reality\" shows on Max. It would be nice to have a  \"not interested\" button to where I never have to see them recommended to me again.Allow Users to Hide the \"Skip Credits\" Button: I am sure many of you who use streaming services have encountered this. You are watching the opening credits of a television show and a \"Skip Credits\" button shows up in the lower right hand corner or somewhere else on the screen. Now I love the opening credits of television shows. I will actually go on YouTube to watch some of my favourite opening credits (Batman, Mad Men, The X-Files, and so on). I never want to skip the credits, even on those rare occasions when I am watching multiple episodes of a TV show. Despite this, there is still that \"Skip Credits\" button in the corner of the screen, often obscuring part of the credits. Personally, I would just as soon be able to hide the button entirely.Sections for Classic Movies and Classic Television Shows: Now many streaming services have sections for classic movies and classic TV shows. Unfortunately, many do not. As a fan of older movies and TV shows, I would appreciate a section for classic movies and a section for classic TV shows on every streaming service I use. This would make things much easier when I want to watch a classic movie or classic TV show, but I am not quite sure what I want to watch. After all, streaming services generally have sections for the various genres (Comedy, Drama, Action, et. al.).Better Search: Now all streaming services allow one to search by title. A few even let one search by actor or director. If it were up to me, every single streaming services would allow one to search by actor or director. What is more, when searching for actors it should bring up all of their credits, even in movies where their parts are small. I remember quite a while back I searched for my dearest Vanessa Marquez on HBO Max and nothing came up, even though Stand and Devlier (1988) was on the platform. Now, given how large Vanessa's role is in Stand and Deliver, she should always come up in searches for the film.Anyway, for the past 15 years I have enjoyed streaming services. As much as I love them though, I do wish they were a little bit better."},

He appeared in six of Darren Aronofsky's movies alone (in a 2012 interview he joked that he thought Mr. Aronofsky \"...thinks he has an obligation!\"). Not only did he play many roles, but those roles were also varied. On television he was Jimmy on The Equalizer, Hector Salamanca on Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, and Sicilian leader Antonio Nappa on Oz. His film roles were varied too. In Pi he played mathematics expert and the protagonist's mentor Sol Robeson. In another Aronofsky film he played a priest, Father Avila. He was Ace's sinister sounding landlord Mr. Shickadance in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Over the years Mark Margolis played criminals, spies, police officers, and even a fallen angel (Magog in Noah). What is more, he played all of his roles well. If Mark Margolis was so prolific, it was because he was just so talented."},
{"title": "Genevieve McGillicuddy Returns to TCM", "date": "Thursday, August 3, 2023", "text": "It was in June of this year that Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) laid off several individuals at Turner Classic Movies, among them Pola Changnon, general manager of TCM, Charles Tabesh, senior vice president in charge of content and programming, and Genevieve McGillicuddy, vice president of enterprises and strategic partnerships. The outrage on the part of TCM fans was swift and immediate. After all, not only did they perceive the layoffs as a threat to TCM's existence, but many fans had met Pola Changnon, Charlie Tabesh, and Genevieve McGillicuddy and think very highly of them. It was right away that the hashtag SaveTCM began appearing on multiple social media services. Directors Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Paul Thomas Anderson, all of them ardent TCM fans, even  met with David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Discovery, to discuss the future of the cable channel. It was only about a week after the layoffs that  WBD reversed course and restored  Charlie Tabesh as Turner Classic Movies' programming chief. It was just this Tuesday, August 1 2023, that long time TCM host Ben Mankiewicz announced on Twitter (seen above) that the return of TCM Film Festival Director Genevieve McGillicuddy was imminent and she was already at work on the 2024 TCM Film Festival. For TCM fans this is particularly good news. Genevieve McGillicuddy has organized the TCM Classic Film Festival for literally years and she is so strongly identified with the festival that many fans believe that it could not take place without her. What is more, she has always had a very close relationship with fans, to the point that she has granted several interviews to bloggers over the years. Essentially, Genevieve McGillicuddy's return would seem to be something of a guarantee of both TCM and the TCM Classic Film Festival's survival. Of course, while I have no doubt that fans are overjoyed at the return of Genevieve McGillicuddy, I have no doubt they are still angry over the layoffs (I know I am). Indeed, to many of us the layoffs simply did not make sense. We all realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is deep in debt and CEO David Zaslav wants to make it profitable. We also realize that there have been massive layoffs across the board at WBD. That having been said, TCM costs much less to operate than many other divisions of WBD. What is more, it has always been profitable. Laying off individuals who had been with TCM for literally decades (Charlie Tabesh had been with TCM since the beginning) would seem to endanger the channel's profitability. It should be little wonder that fans were terrified that WBD was plotting to shut TCM down entirely.Regardless, the outrage over the layoffs on the part of fans demonstrates just how valued TCM is. And there is every reason it should be. It is currently the only cable channel that shows classic movies commercial free 24 hours day. It has played an active role in both preserving classic films and in introducing new generations to classic movies. It is little wonder that Turner Classic Movies is an integral part of many of its fans' lives. It is a treasure that should and must be preserved."},
{"title": "Godspeed Paul Reubens, Forever Pee-Wee Herman", "date": "Wednesday, August 2, 2023", "text": "Paul Reubens, best known for his character Pee-Wee Herman, died on July 30 2023 at the age of 70. The cause was cancer.Paul Reubens was born Paul Rubenfeld on August 27 1952 in  Peekskill, New York.  During his childhood his family lived in Oneonta, New York and Sarasota, Florida.  Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus's winter headquarters was located in Sarasota, and young Paul Rubenfeld spent a good deal of time there. It would have a lasting influence on him. He attended Sarasota High School, where he was president of the National Thespian Society. He attended Plymouth State University for one semester before attending Boston University. Afterwards he attended the California Institute of the Arts to study acting.It was in the 1970s that Paul Reubens started playing in local clubs. He made 14 appearances on The Gong Show, some of them as part of The Hilarious Betty and Eddie with friend Charlotte McGinnis. It was not long after appearing on The Gong Show that he joined the comedy troupe The Groundlings. He would be a member of the troupe for seven years. The idea for his character Pee-Wee Herman came about in 1978 in an improvisation exercise with The Groundlings. In the late Seventies he also appeared in the TV movie Things We Did Last Summer and the TV show Working Stiffs. He provided voices for The Flintstone Comedy Show. He appeared in the movies Midnight Madness (1980), Pray TV (1980), The Blues Brothers (1980), and Cheech and Chong's Next Movie (1980). It was for the 1980-1981 season that Paul Reubens auditioned for Saturday Night Live. He was passed up for Gilbert Gottfried. It was because he was not hired for Saturday Night Live that Paul Reubens created his own live show called The Pee-Wee Herman Show. It played at the Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood for five months. In 1981 it aired on HBO on their TV series On Location. For the next many years Paul Reubens would only appear as Pee-Wee Herman and was even billed as the character. The character Pee-Wee Herman starred in two of his own movies during the Eighties, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (1985) and Big Top Pee-Wee (1988). From 1986 to 1990 Pee-Wee Herman had his own live-action show on CBS on Saturday morning, Pee-Wee's Playhouse. He appeared in the movies Nice Dreams (1981), Pandemonium (1982), Meatballs Part II (1984), and Back to the Beach (1987). He provided voices for Flight of the Navigator (1986) and Moonwalker (1988). On television he appeared on the TV shows Mork & Mindy, Madame's Place, Faerie Tale Theatre, 227, and Sesame Street.In the Nineties he played recurring character Andrew J. Lansing III on Murphy Brown. He guest starred on Everybody Loves Raymond. He was a guest voice on the animated series Hercules. Paul Reubens appeared in the movies Batman Returns (1992), Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), Dunston Checks In (1996), Matilda (1996), Buddy (1997), Mystery Men (1999), and South of Heaven, West of Hell (2000). He provided voices for The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Doctor Dolittle (1998). In the Naughts Paul Reubens appeared on the TV shows Ally McBeal, Tripping the Rift, Campus Ladies, Reno 911!, Tom Goes to the Mayor, 30 Rock, Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, and Pushing Daisies. He was the voice of Bat-Mite on Batman: The Brave and the Bold. He was a guest voice on the animated shows Rugrats, Chowder, and Adventure Time. He appeared in the movies Blow (2001), The Tripper (2006), Reno 911!: Miami (2007), and Life During Wartime (2009).In the Teens he provided voices on the animated series Tron: The Uprising and Voltron: Legendary Defender. He was a guest voice on the animated shows Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turbo FAST, American Dad!, Star Wars: Rebels, Phineas and Ferb, Pickle and Peanut, and Penn Zero: Part Time Hero.   He was the guest voice of Dybbuk on the television series Legends of Tomorrow. He had a recurring roles on The Blacklist, Gotham, and Mosaic. He guest starred on the shows Comedy Bang! Bang!, Sanjay and Craig, Portlandia, Tigtone, What We Do in the Shadows, and The Connors. He was the voice of Jokey in the movie The Smurfs 2 (2013). He appeared in the movies Accidental Love (2015) and Pee-Wee's Big Holiday (2015).In the 2020s, Paul Reubens was a guest voice on the animated shows The Tom and Jerry Show and Bob's Burgers. For much of his later career he also provided voices for several video games.There is no doubt that Paul Reubens will forever be best remembered as Pee-Wee Herman, the exuberant man-child he played for much of his career, most notably in the films Pee-Wee's Big Adventure  and Big Top Pee-Wee, and the TV series Pee-Wee's Playhouse. But Paul Reubens was capable of playing a wide array of other characters. He played The Spleen in Mystery Men, a superhero with a most unusual superpower. In the movie Blow he actually played a drug dealer who quoted lines from show tunes. On Murphy Brown he played the nephew of network president Stan Lansing (Garry Marshall), Andrew J. Lansing III, a sociopath who is nonetheless one of Murphy's few competent secretaries. On Gotham he played the biological father of The Penguin, Elijah Van Dahl. Although Paul Reubens will always be best remembered as Pee-Wee Herman, he played  wide variety of other roles and played them well."},
{"title": "The 30th Anniversary of the TV Show Culture Clash", "date": "Monday, July 31, 2023", "text": "It was thirty years ago today that a historic television show debuted. Culture Clash was a sketch comedy show starring the comedy troupe of the same, consisting of Richard Montoya, Ric Salinas, and Herbert Sigüenza. What made Culture Clash historic is that it was the first Latino sketch comedy show to air on American television. For a time my dear friend Vanessa Marquez, of Stand and Deliver and ER fame, numbered among the regulars on the show.The origins of the comedy troupe Culture Clash go back to another troupe called Comedy Fiesta founded on Cinco De Mayo, May 5, 1984 by Richard Montoya, Ric Salinas,  Herbert Sigüenza, and  José Antonio Burciaga. Comedy Fiesta also included Marga Gómez, and Monica Palacios. The group worked with El Teatro Campesino, a Chicano theatre company founded by playwright Luis Valdez in 1965. Comedy Fiesta eventually broke up, and José Antonio Burciaga, Richard Montoya, Ric Salinas, and   Herbert Sigüenza formed Culture Clash. Mr. Burciaga left Culture Clash in 1988 and died from cancer in 1996. The troupe produced their first full length play, The Mission, in 1988. In 1991 they produced their show A Bowl of Being.It was in 1991 that Cheech Martin saw A Bowl of Being at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. He signed Culture Clash to star in their own sitcom, which would be financed by 20th Television (then the syndication and distribution unit of 20th Century Fox Television). The Fox Television Network ordered a pilot, which was based on characters Culture Clash had created on stage, but was written by other people. Fox ultimately decided against placing it on their fall schedule, but ordered six more scripts (again, written by others) that were workshopped at a local theatre. Fox eventually cancelled the project entirely, although it may have been just as well. At the time Ric Salinas said that Fox was \"definitely smart to kill it.\" The scripts were apparently filled with banal material and Latino stereotypes.With the sitcom project dead in the water, Culture Clash wrote a script for a sketch comedy show, but Fox turned it down. The network and the comedy troupe entered into talks about a Cinco de Mayo comedy special, but nothing ever came of it. Fortunately, executives from Fox Television Stations Productions, which produces shows for Fox owned and operated stations, saw one of Culture Clash's performances in June 1992. They then approached Culture Clash about a deal.Fortunately, Fox Television Stations Productoins agreed to a test run of Culture Clash for six episodes on KTTV, the Fox owned and operated station in Los Angeles, which began on July 31 1993.  Richard Montoya, Ric Salinas, and Herbert Sigüenza served as executive producers on the show. The show was taped in front of a live audience at the Mayan Theatre. The show's house band was led by Tito Larriva, formerly of pioneering punk band The Plugz and The Cruzados. The test run proved successful enough that Culture Clash was soon appearing on other television stations around the country. Ultimately, 30 episodes were produced.Culture Clash featured both musical guests and guest comedians. Among the musical guests were Machete and Chicano Squad. Among the comics appearing on Culture Clash were Gilbert Esquivel, Raul Martinez, Carlos Oscar, and others. It also featured guest appearances by such notables as Maria Conchita Alonso, Rosanna DeSoto, Dolores Huerta, Edward James Olmos, and Jimmy Smits. Given the big names the show attracted and its a popularity at the time, it is surprising that the Fox television network never picked it up. They would have been wise to do so.Vanessa Marquez circa1993.As mentioned earlier, Vanessa Marquez was a regular on the TV show Culture Clash early in its run. Vanessa thoroughly enjoyed her work on Culture Clash. Culture Clash appreciated Vanessa in turn, and are among those who have done tributes to her since her death. The TV series Culture Clash let Vanessa play a wide variety of  roles. She played Maria in the sketch \"West Side Story...35 Years Later,\" in which she even got to demonstrate her singing skill. She played a sexy pizza delivery lady in one of the sketches featuring the recurring characters Beto and Chon (a pair of clueless Cholos). She played an extremely intelligent game show contestant on a parody of Jeopardy. She even played one of a deceased man's many mistresses at his funeral in one sketch. Vanessa was working on Culture Clash when she received word that she had been cast in a pilot for a new show called ER. Looking back, she said she would have better off remaining on Culture Clash.Sadly, the TV series Culture Clash has not been widely available since it went off the air in 1996. It has never been released on DVD and it is not on any streaming services. There are a few clips that have been uploaded to YouTube (some by Vanessa herself), but that has been it. That is a real shame, as Culture Clash was not only a groundbreaking show as the first Latino sketch comedy show, but it was also an extremely funny show going by the clips that are online. What is more, it displayed much of the biting satire for which Culture Clash are known. It really should be released to DVD and made available through streaming.At the time Culture Clash debuted, there was very little in the way of Latino representation on American television. What is more, this had been the case since Chico and Man ended in its run in 1978, with the exception of a few short-lived shows like a.k.a. Pablo. And as mentioned before, it was the first Latino sketch comedy show. Even though it is not currently available, Culture Clash is still remembered for the trails it blazed."},
{"title": "Teresa Wright's Remarkable Contract with Samuel Goldwyn", "date": "Friday, July 28, 2023", "text": "Teresa Wright was a movie star from the beginning of her film career. It was in 1939 that she began a two-year stint playing Mary Skinner in Life with Father on Broadway. She had been appearing in Life with Father for a year when legendary film producer Samuel Goldwyn attended one of its performances. Impressed by her acting skills, Mr. Goldwyn immediately signed her to play Zannie Giddens, the daughter of lead character Regina Giddens, in the in the 1941 movie adaptation of Lillian Hellman's play The Little Foxes. Samuel Goldwyn also signed Teresa Wright to a five year contract.Teresa Wright's contract with Samuel Goldwyn would be unusual for an actress in Hollywood in that it contained the following stipulation:\"The aforementioned Teresa Wright shall not be required to pose for photographs in a bathing suit unless she is in the water. Neither may she be photographed running on the beach with her hair flying in the wind. Nor may she pose in any of the following situations: In shorts, playing with a cocker spaniel; digging in a garden; whipping up a meal; attired in firecrackers and holding skyrockets for the Fourth of July; looking insinuatingly at a turkey for Thanksgiving; wearing a bunny cap with long ears for Easter; twinkling on prop snow in a skiing outfit while a fan blows her scarf; assuming an athletic stance while pretending to hit something with a bow and arrow.\"To many people today this stipulation might seem unusual, but for classic movie buffs familiar with classic pinups, it is clear Teresa Wright's contract is listing some of the most common tropes found in pinup pictures. Quite simply, in a rather humorous fashion, Teresa Wright is stating that she will not do many types of pinup pictures. It was in this way that Teresa Wright asserted herself as a serious actress. And Teresa Wright would be taken very seriously as an actress. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for The Little Foxes (1941). The next year she won the Oscar for  Best Supporting Actress for Mrs. Miniver (1942) and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress for The Pride of the Yankees (1942).  She would go on to appear in the classics Shadow of a Doubt (1943) and The Best Years of Our Lives (1946). Even though she was taken seriously as an actress, Teresa Wright did wind up doing some pinup pictures, but they were not as goofy or campy as other pinups of the time. An example can be seen to the left. Of course, notice the look on her face...Teresa Wright and Samuel Goldwyn would eventually part ways. It was in December 1948 that he cancelled her contract with the claims that she refused to promote the movie Enchantment (1948) and that she was \"uncooperative.\" In response Teresa Wright stated that she never refused to do what was asked of her, but at the time she was in poor health. While Miss Wright would give many more great performances, in the following decades she would not see the success in movies that she had in the Forties.Below are a few examples of the sort of pinups to which Teresa Wright objected doing....Possibly the most famous pinup of all time: Betty Grable in a swimsuit, but clearly not in the water.From the Fifties, but they also did these types of pinups in the Forties: Jayne Mansfield whipping up a meal.Here's Ann Miller with some really big firecrackers.And here's Heather Angel dressed in bunny ears for Easter.While I love the old, campy pinups, I can fully understand why Teresa Wright might have thought she would have been taken less seriously if she did them!"},
{"title": "DC Comic Books Based on Sitcoms", "date": "Thursday, July 27, 2023", "text": "When comic book fans think of comics and licensed properties, they are inclined to think of Dell Comics or Gold Key, both of which published several titles based on licensed properties over the years (most famously, those based on various Disney cartoons). While Dell and Gold Key may have been the undisputed kings of comic books based on licensed properties, DC Comics (back when it was still officially known as National Comics Publications and later National Periodical Publications), published a good number of comic books based on licensed properties from the Golden Age into the Silver Age. And while DC Comics has always been best known for such superheroes as Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, over the years they did publish titles based on radio and television sitcoms.DC Comics' first comic book based on a radio sitcom also proved to be its most successful title based on a situation comedy. The radio show A Date with Judy debuted on NBC Red on June 24 1941 as a summer replacement for The Pepsodent Show Starring Bob Hope. It centred on teenager Judy Foster (initially played by Anne Gillis and later Dellie Ellis and Louise Erickson). A Date with Judy proved to be highly successful, running until May 4 1950. A movie based on the radio show, A Date with Judy (1948), starred Jane Powell as Judy Foster. There were two television adaptations of the radio show. The first was a daytime version that debuted on ABC on June 2 1951 and ran until February 23 1952. The second was a prime time version that also aired on ABC and ran from July 15 1952 to September 30 1953. As to the DC Comics version of A Date with Judy, its first issue was dated October/November 1947. Henry Boltinoff, who wrote several of DC Comics' humour titles and fillers over the years, wrote the comic book A Date with Judy throughout its run. Bob Oskner, who would work on several other DC comics based on licensed properties (including The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis and The Adventures of Bob Hope), provided much of the artwork throughout its run. A Date with Judy ultimately lasted longer than the sitcom upon which it was based. It ran for 79 issues until October–November 1960, a full 13 years.The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet is still a familiar name today, but the comic book based on the popular sitcom did not prove to be a hit. The radio show The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet debuted on October 8 1944 on CBS. It centred on the lives of performers Ozzie and Harriet Nelson and their sons David and Ricky. The radio show proved to be a hit, running until June 18 1954. The television version of the show proved even more successful, running from October 3 1952 to April 23 1966. Running for 14 seasons, it was the longest running live-action sitcom until it was surpassed by It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. The comic book The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet did not last nearly as long as the radio show or television show. Its first issue was dated November 1949. It only ran for five issues until July 1950. Curiously, this was not the last time Ricky Nelson would be seen in a comic book. Dell Comics published an issue of their long-running title Four Colour (dated June-August 1959) starring Ricky Nelson. It seems pretty obvious that this comic book was meant to capitalize on the popularity of Ricky Nelson, who was then both a pop star and a teen idol. Regardless, it would not lead to a regular title starring Ricky Nelson.It would be several years before DC Comics attempted another title based on a sitcom. This time it would star a big name actor and comedian. When DC Comics' Jackie Gleason and The Honeymooners hit newsstands, Jackie Gleason was not a newcomer to comic books. St. John had published a Jackie Gleason comic book from September 1955 to December 1955, only four issues. DC Comics would have a bit more success. The comic book Jackie Gleason and The Honeymooners was based on Jackie Gleason's most famous creation. The Honeymooners originated as a series of sketches on Cavalcade of the Stars on the Dumont Network. Jackie Gleason took the \"Honeymooners\" sketches with him when he moved to CBS for The Jackie Gleason Show. It was in 1955 that the sketches were spun off as a sitcom. As a sitcom The Honeymooners proved to be very popular. The sitcom ended after one season not because of low ratings, but because Jackie Gleason wanted to end the show while it was on top. He did not think they could sustain the quality of the series following the first season. Regardless, the \"Honeymooners\" sketches would return on The Jackie Gleason Show and would continue to be seen until The Jackie Gleason Show ended its run in 1970. As to the comic book, the first issue of Jackie Gleason and The Honeymooners was dated July 1956. It ran for twelve issues until May 1958. It was while Jackie Gleason and The Honeymooners was still being published that DC Comics came out with their next title based on a sitcom. Sgt. Bilko was based on the popular sitcom The Phil Silvers Show. The Phil Silvers Show focused on Master Sgt. Ernest G. Bilko, who spent his time in the peace-time Army coming up with various get-rich-quick schemes. The Phil Silvers Show debuted on September 20 1955 on CBS under the title You'll Never Get Rich (it was retitled only a few weeks into its run). It was still doing well in the ratings when it ended its run on September 11 1959.DC Comics' Sgt Bilko hit newsstands with its first issue dated June 1957. The title proved to be relatively successful, running for 18 issues until April 1960. Sgt. Bilko would be unique among DC Comics' comic books based on sitcoms in that it is the only one to have a spinoff. Private Doberman, played by Maurice Gosfield, had proven to be the breakout character on The Phil Silvers Show. It is perhaps for that reason he received his own comic book, Sgt. Bilko's Pvt. Doberman, the first issue of which was dated July 1958. It ultimately ran for eleven issues, until March 1960.DC Comics' next sitcom title would prove to be even more successful than Sgt. Bilko The TV show The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis was based on Max Shulman's popular short stories that had also inspired the musical The Affairs of Dobie Gillis (1953). Like Max Shulman's short stories, The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis centred on love crazy teenager Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman). On the TV show he was the son of independent grocer Herbert T. Gillis (Frank Faylen). His best friend was television's first beatnik, Maynard G. Krebs (Bob Denver).  The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis debuted on September 29 1959 and proved to be popular. It ended its run on June 5 1963 after four seasons, having been toppled in the ratings by NBC's hit Western The Virginian. Curiously, while the title of the sitcom would be shortened to Dobie Gillis in its second season and then changed to Max Shulman's Dobie Gillis in its fourth season, the comic book would always be titled The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. The first issue of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis was cover dated June 1960. It ran for 26 issues until October 1964, so that the comic book ultimately ran as long as the sitcom had. While The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis ended with no. 26 (October 1964), it would have something of a strange afterlife. In the Sixties DC Comics had a title called Showcase, in which they published trial runs of new features. If a feature proved popular, it would receive its own title. It was with Showcase no. 81 (March 1968) that they introduced Windy and Willy. That having been said, Windy and Willy was nothing new. The stories were nothing more and nothing less than stories from the run of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis re-lettered and redrawn. Dobie Gillis became Willy Newton, while Maynard G. Krebs became Windy Wiggs. The trial run in Showcase proved successful enough that Windy and Willy received its own title, the first issue cover dated June 1969. Windy and Willy did not last long. It only ran for four issues, until December 1969.It would be twelve years after DC Comics' The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis ended before they would attempt another title based on sitcom. In some respects, DC Comics' Welcome Back, Kotter was something of an anomaly. DC Comics had cancelled their humour titles in  the early Seventies and in the mid-Seventies they published little in the way of comic books based on licensed properties. Regardless, the sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter had proven to be a hit, particularly popular with younger viewers. For its first season it came in at no. 18 in the Nielsen ratings for the year. Welcome Back, Kotter debuted on September 9 1975. It starred Gabe Kaplan as Gabe Kotter, a teacher who returns to teach remedial students known as \"the Sweathogs' at his old high school.  The show turned John Travolta into a star and ultimately ran for four seasons. The first issue of DC Comics' Welcome Back, Kotter was dated November 1976. Writers on the title varied for the entirety of its run. Elliot S. Maggin wrote the first two issues. Over the years he would write stories for Superman, Batman, Adam Strange, and other DC characters. Later Tony Isabella, Mark Evanier, and others would write for the series. Some of the covers were drawn by the aforementioned Bob Oskner, who had worked on several of DC's humour titles and their titles based on licensed properties. Welcome Back, Kotter ran for ten issues, ending its run in April 1978. After the title had been cancelled, DC Comics issued a  Limited Collectors' Edition that featured a look behind the scenes on the sitcom.  Limited Collectors' Editions were over-sized comic books published by DC Comics in the Seventies, mostly containing reprints of older material.On the surface it might look as if DC Comics had little success with adaptations of radio and television sitcoms, with the exception of the long-running  A Date with Judy. The same might be said of Dell Comics and Gold Key if one looks at how long many of their sitcom titles ran. In many cases, comic books based on sitcoms continued being published only as long as the sitcom was still running. Sgt. Bilko and The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis ended their runs a little after both shows ended their network runs. Over at Dell Comics, their comic book based on The Beverly Hillbillies ended its run in 1971, only a little before the show was cancelled by CBS. It would seem that in many cases comic books based on sitcoms would seem to remain popular only as long as that sitcom is on the air.Regardless, DC Comics' comic books based on sitcoms are fondly remembered by many and of interest to fans of those shows, even ones like me who weren't around when the TV shows were first on the air and the comic books were being published. Indeed, I would be very happy if DC Comics published collections of Jackie Gleason and The Honeymooners, Sgt. Bilko, and The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, giving many fans of those shows a chance to read their comic book adventures."},
{"title": "1968 Coppertone Commercial", "date": "Wednesday, July 26, 2023", "text": "Among the things I remember from child are commercials for suntan lotion, now more commonly called sunscreen. During the summer commercials for suntan lotion were ubiquitous, particularly commercials for Coppertone. Here is an example of one of those commercials, which would have aired when I was a mere tyke.The commercial is notable for starring Anne Randall, who was the Playmate of the Month for the May 1967 issue of Playboy. She would later be a regular for a short time on the soap opera Days of Our Lives and a regular for two years on Hee Haw. She guest starred on such shows as Banyon, McCloud, The Streets of San Francisco, Cannon, and The Rockford Files. She appeared in such movies as Hell's Bloody Devils (1970) and Westworld (1973), as well as the TV movie The Night Strangler (the sequel to The Night Stalker). Interviewing Anne Randall in the commercial is Army Archerd, who was a columnist for Variety for over fifty years. Army Archerd also appeared in several movies, usually as himself, including Teacher's Pet (1958), What a Way to Go! (1964), Wild in the Streets (1968), and several others. He was well known for his appearances on Hollywood Squares in the Seventies.Here I must note that while I remember suntan lotion commercials from my childhood well, I have never really used it. I am part Cherokee and I rarely get sunburns. And, before anyone says anything, yes, I know I should use suntan lotion."},
{"title": "The 100th Anniversary of Estelle Getty's Birth", "date": "Tuesday, July 25, 2023", "text": "It was 100 years ago on this date that Estelle Getty was born in New York City. I eulogized her when she died in 2008 at the age of 84 from Lewy body dementia, so here I will just discuss some of her better known roles.  Of course, Estelle Getty is best known as Sophia Petrillo, Dorothy's wisecracking mother, on The Golden Girls. Amazingly enough, Sophia was originally meant to be a recurring character, but Estelle Getty as the character proved to be a hit with test audiences, and so she became a regular. At the beginning of the show Sophia was 80 years old, but Estelle Getty was only in her early sixties at the time. As a result, she had to wear make up to make her look older. It is quite possible that Sophia is the most popular character on The Golden Girls, and as a result she would appear on episodes of other shows as well. Indeed, she appeared in 52 episodes of the Golden Girls spinoff Empty Nest. She also appeared on one episode of the Empty Nest spinoff Nurses and an episode of Blossom. Of course, she was a regular on the short-lived Golden Girls sequel/spinoff The Golden Palace.While Estelle Getty will probably always be best remembered as Sophia on The Golden Girls, she played other roles as well. In Mannequin (1987) she played kindly department store owner Claire Timkn. In Mask (1985) she played Evelyn, the grandmother of Rocky (who had craniodiaphyseal dysplasia). In the film she often acts as a mediator between Rocky (Eric Stoltz) and his mother Rusty (Cher), as well as a mediator between Rusty and her husband Abe and his daughter Rusty. While Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992) is not a particularly good film, Estelle Getty was still entertaining as the constantly interfering mother of Police Sergeant Joe Bomowski (Sylvester Stallone).Amazingly enough, Estelle Getty did not begin her career in film and television until she was older. She spent years performing various roles in New York theatres. She made her film debut in a small role in the movie Team-Mates in 1978. In 1981 she made her television debut in a guest appearance on the short-lived TV show Nurse. It was in 1982, when she was 59 years old, that she appeared on Broadway in Torch Song Trilogy. By later seasons of The Golden Girls Lewy body dementia began to take its toll, as she struggled to remember lines despite years as an actress on stage. With her health in decline, Estelle Getty retired from acting following a guest appearance on the show It's Like...You Know in 2001. Estelle Getty was certainly a remarkable actress and played one of the most memorable characters on television. And while she will always be remembered as Sophia Petrillo, she played many other roles as well."},
{"title": "\"Because of You\" by Tony Bennett", "date": "Saturday, July 22, 2023", "text": "Tony Bennett, one of the last and greatest crooners, died yesterday at the age of 96. In tribute to him I then thought I would share what was both his debut single and his first no. 1 hit. \"Because of You\" was written by Arthur Hammerstein and Dudley Wilkinson in 1940. The first recording of it was by Larry Clinton and His Orchestra, who recorded it on December 12 1940. The song did fairly well, ranking no. 95 for the year 1941.Tony Bennett recorded his cover of \"Because of You\" on April 4 1951. Percy Faith did the orchestral backing for Mr. Bennett's version of the song. \"Because of You\" by Tony Bennett proved to be a massive hit, reaching no. 1 on the Billboard chart and remaining at no. 1 for 10 weeks. It is easy to see why it was such a huge hit. While it was Tony Bennett's first single, on the record he already sounds like an accomplished singer. His rich, expressive baritone is already apparent in his version of \"Because of You.\"Tony Bennett continued to perform \"Because of You\" for the rest of his life, and it was part of his repertoire even in his final concerts. According to Tony Bennett's team, he was still singing at his piano the day before he died. The final song he sang was \"Because of You.\""},
{"title": "The Late Great Tony Bennett", "date": "Friday, July 21, 2023", "text": "Legendary crooner Tony Bennett died today, July 21 2023, at the age of 96. In February 2021 he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.Tony Bennett was born Anthony Dominick Benedetto on August 3 1926 in New York City in Long Island City in Queens. He took to singing when he was very young, and he was only 10 years old when he performed \"Marching Along Together\" at the opening of the Triborough Bridge, standing beside then New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. His father died when he was only 10, but had an enormous impact on young Tony, giving him both a love of art and literature and a sense of compassion. Tony Bennett attended P.S. 141 and the School of Industrial Art, but had to drop out when he was 16 years old to help make a living for his family as a singing waiter. Tony Bennett was drafted into the  U.S. Army in 1944. While in the Army he took part in the liberation of the Kaufering concentration camp, a subcamp of Dachau. He would eventually be assigned to Special Services where he sang with a band until he was discharged in 1946. After his service he returned to New York City where he studied singing at the American Theatre Wing on the G.I. Bill. He worked as an elevator operator and sang in nightclubs under the name Joe Bari. It was in 1949 that Bob Hope saw him open for Pearl Bailey in Greenwich Village. Mr. Hope asked Tony Bennett to be his opening act at the  Paramount Theatre in Times Square. It was Bob Hope he suggest that he change his stage name, maintaining \"Joe Bari\" was not a very good pseudonym. He told Mr. Hope that his given name was Anthony Bennedetto. It was then that Bob Hope decided he should be \"Tony Bennett.\"In 1950 Tony Bennett was signed to Columbia Records by the legendary Mitch Miller. His first single, \"Because of You,\" was also his first hit. It went to no. 1 on the Billboard singles chart in 1951. Throughout the Fifties he had several more hits, including \"Cold, Cold Heart,\" \"Rags to Riches,\" and \"Stranger in Paradise.\" His first studio album, Because of You, was released in 1952.The Sixties saw Tony Bennett have fewer hits on the Billboard Hot 100, largely because of the British Invasion and the growth of rock music. He still regularly hit the Adult Contemporary chart throughout the decade. It was in 1962 that his signature song, his version of \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco,\" was released. It peaked at no. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100, but spent around a year on various other charts. His 1962 album featuring the song went to no. 5 on the Billboard album chart. Unfortunately, as the Sixties progressed and into the Seventies, Tony Bennett struggled to maintain his career. None of his songs charted on the Billboard Hot 100 during the decade and only a few charted on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. By the end of the Seventies, he did not have a recording contract nor did he have a manager. Fortunately, his career began to rebound in the Eighties. He once more had a recording contract and his first album in years, 1986's The Art of Excellence, went to no. 160 on the Billboard album chart. In 1986 the song \"Life in a Looking Glass,\" which he performed, from the movie That's Life! (1986), was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song. It was in the late Eighties and early Nineties that Tony Bennett's comeback continued and he began to attract younger fans. He appeared on several television shows, including Late Night with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Muppets Tonight, and several different MTV shows. He even voiced himself on The Simpsons. Once more, his albums regularly charted on the Billboard album chart. He sang duets with several contemporary artists, including k.d. lang, Billy Joel, Michael Bu Bublé, Amy Winehouse, and, most famously, Lady Gaga.  Tony Bennett continued to perform until 2021, when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. His final album, with Lady Gaga, Love for Sale, was released on September 30 2021. In total, Tony Bennett released 61 studio albums, 11 live albums, and 83 singles. He won 20 different Grammy Awards.In addition to his many appearances on variety shows and talk shows throughout his career, Tony Bennett also took some acting roles. He made his acting debut as Cousin Stephen on an episode of The Danny Thomas Show in 1959. He also guest starred on the shows 77 Sunset Strip and Evening Shade. He guest starred as himself on numerous shows, including The Doris Day Show, Remington Steele, Cybill, Suddenly Susan, Cosby, Entourage, Blue Bloods, 30 Rock, and The Simpsons. He played himself in the mini-series King. He also appeared in the movies The Oscar (1966), The Scout (1994), Analyse This (1999), Bruce Almighty (2003), and Muppets Most Wanted (2014). Tony Bennett also wrote and co-wrote several books. He also painted under his given name Anthony Bennedetto. His artwork was displayed in galleries around the world, and he has paintings that are parts of the permanent collections of various museums around the world. In addition to being a talented singer, Tony Bennett was also an activist. He was outraged by the treatment of fellow music artists such as Nat King Cole and Duke Ellington, who were often not allowed in hotels or even concert hall dining rooms due to their race. When his friend Harry Belafonte asked him to join him in the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.'s protest march from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, Alabama, he eagerly accepted. At the Stars for Freedom rally that took place in Montgomery, he performed for those who had marched alongside such artists as Joan Baez, Sammy Davis Jr., Ella Fitzgerald, Mahalia Jackson, Pete Seeger, and many others. He later participated in the boycott of apartheid South Africa and performed for Nelson Mandela when he made his first visit to Britain as South Africa's president. For his work with the Civil Rights movement, Tony Bennett was inducted into the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame in Atlanta. If Tony Bennett saw so much success and had such a long career, it is because he was such an talented singer. He had a rich baritone and could sing songs with a diversity of emotions, from sad ballads to more upbeat, happy songs. His voice was also powerful. At various concerts over the years he would sing one song without a microphone and was still able to be heard at the back of the room. In 1965 Frank Sinatra himself said in an interview with Life magazine, \"For my money, Tony Bennett is the best singer in the business. He excites me when I watch him. He moves me. He's the singer who gets across what the composer has in mind, and probably a little more.\" It is little wonder that his popularity cut across several generations. Of course, he was also a truly great man, given his service in the United States Army and his dedication to the Civil Rights Movement. Tony Bennett was one of a kind, and we will never see his like again."},
{"title": "I Support the WGA and SAG-AFTRA", "date": "Thursday, July 20, 2023", "text": "It was on May 2 2023 that the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike as part of a dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). It was on July 14 2023 that the WGA was joined by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). The WGA last went into strike during 2007 and 2008. For SAG-AFTRA it has been even longer. The last time they had a major strike was in 1980 This is the first time since 1960 that both the writers and actors unions have been on strike at the same time.There are many reasons the WGA and SAG-AFTRA have gone on strike, but foremost among them are higher pay and better residuals. Sadly, I have heard some people complain about the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike because they think all Hollywood writers and actors are rich. Now this might be true of top stars like Tom Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio, and top writers like Terry Rossio and David Knoepp, but it is not true of the average actor or writer. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics, the average actor makes $27.73 an hour. That is far below the average hourly wage in California of $36.70. On top of that, one also has to take into account other factors impacting actors as well. First, many actors have agents and managers who receive a percentage of their pay, reducing the money they make even more. Second, because of the nature of their work, actors can go without a job for periods of time. Third, because the film and television industry is primarily based in California, many actors live and work there, where the cost of living is much higher than other parts of the country.Like the average actor, the average writer is not paid particularly well by the film and television industry either. According to ZipRecruiter, the average pay for television writers is s $22.53 per hour, which, like actors, is below the average hourly wage in California of $36.70. Movie writers are paid a little better than either television writers or actors, but they still only make an average of  $38.77 per hour, only slightly above California's average hourly wage. The plain truth is that many of the people complaining about the WGA and SAG-AFTRA being on strike probably make more than the average writer or actor in Hollywood.As to residuals, I suspect they are not particularly good for the average writer and I know that they are not good for the average actor. My dear, late friend Vanessa Marquez, who played Ana Delgado on Stand and Deliver (1988) and Nurse Wendy Goldman on ER, once told me that she had received residual cheques as low as a few cents. Despite starring in a classic movie and a hit television show, both of which have been shown regularly since their original releases, Vanessa never made a lot of money from residuals. Jennifer Anniston might make millions of dollars in residuals from Friends. Actors with recurring roles on the show will make much, much less and bit players will get no residuals at all.The amount of money paid to the average writer and actor can be contrasted with what the CEOs of the studios make. David Zaslav of Warner Bros. Discovery, who I believe many would agree is not a good CEO, made $39.3 million in 2022. Bob Bakish of Paramount Global made $32 million in 2022. Bob Iger, the head of Disney, can expect to earn $27 million this year. Not only is this more money than the average writer or actor makes, but it is more money than most of us can expect to make in a lifetime. Of course, what is really scary is that the CEOs of the various studios actually make less than CEOs in other industries. Of course, much of the concern of both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA goes beyond the average writer's and actor's meagre pay. Quite simply, they worry about being replaced. Artificial intelligence has been in the news of late, and both unions have their concerns about AI. The WGA's concern is that producers will use AI to create source material and write or re-write scripts. The WGA then wants strict regulations regarding the use of AI. As to SAG-AFTRA, they also have their own concerns about AI. Allegedly the AMPTP proposed that bit players could work for a day and afterwards their images could be generated by AI. According to the AMPTP, the bit players would have to give their consent and if their image generated by AI is used later they would be paid a \"minimum wage.\"  Naturally, SAG-AFTRA rejected such an idea outright. Of course, my thought is that no writer or actor should ever be replaced by AI. Given it doesn't really take talent to do their jobs, I could see where CEOs could be...Bob Iger of Disney called the WGA and SAG-AFTRA's demands \"not realistic.\" Well, I hope Mr. Iger reads this, because as a fan who pays his salary through watching movies and television shows, I think their demands are both realistic and reasonable. After all, when I pay for a ticket for a movie or watch a movie on a streaming service, I want my money to go to the writers and actors who made it, not an overpaid CEO who has little to no artistic input into movies and TV shows. The plain truth is that throughout the history of Hollywood, the average writer and actor has made very little in the way of money, often barely to live on. The plain truth is also that historically the studios have made money hand over fist. In 2022 alone studio revenue was more than $220 billion. It is time some of that wealth went to the people who actually make movies."},

Since 2019 Silent Sunday Nights has been hosted by Professor Jacqueline Stewart, who is also Academy Museum Director and President. Beginning on July 23 2023 the Academy Museum will be showing silent movies every Sunday at 2:00 PM Pacific. Silent Sundays will showcase movies ranging from well-known, American classics to forgotten films to classics from across the world.It was during the Silent Era that the language of cinema evolved, so that movies made during the era still have an influence on movies made today. Sadly according to a study conducted by the Library of Congress in 2013, 75% of the movies made in the Silent Era have been irrevocably lost. Both Turner Classic Movies and the Academy Museum are dedicated to shining a spotlight on silent movies as an important part of cinema history.Below are the upcoming movies being shown for Silent Sundays.July 23, 2023--Earth (1930) at the Ted Mann Theater: Also known by its original Ukrainian title Zemlya, Earth was directed by legendary Ukrainian director Oleksandr Dovzhenko. The film focuses on the process of collectivization during the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan and its impact on farmers. Earth was banned by Soviet authorities only nine days after it was released and various scenes were cut from the film. It was not until 2012 that the film was fully restored. Earth at the Academy Museum will feature a new soundtrack created by Luke Corradine by order of the UFACE association. July 30 2023--Fanchon the Cricket (1915) with Rosita (1923) at the Ted Mann Theater: This is is a double feature starring Mary Pickford. Fanchon the Cricket is notable as being the only movie in which all three Pickford siblings appear (Mary, Lottie, and Jack). Fanchon the Cricket was long thought to be lost when a copy was discovered at the Cinémathèque Française. Rosita stars Mary Pickford as a street singer in Seville who catches the eye of the King of Spain. It is notable as the first Hollywood film made by director Ernst Lubitsch. Rosita was restored in 2016. Both films will include live musical accompaniment by Michael Mortilla.August 6 2023--Flesh and the Devil (1926) at the Ted Mann Theater: Flesh and the Devil is the film that made Greta Garbo an international star.

{"title": "The 90th Anniversary of Popeye Cartoons", "date": "Friday, July 14, 2023", "text": "Scene from \"Popeye the Sailor\" (1933)It was 90 years ago on this date, on June 14 1933, that the animated theatrical short \"Popeye the Sailor\" was released. Having first appeared in the comic strip Thimble Theatre, \"Popeye the Sailor\" marked the film debut of Popeye, as well as his love interest Olive Oyl and his rival Bluto. \"Popeye the Sailor\" would launch an entire series of Popeye theatrical cartoons that lasted until 1957.Popeye first appeared in the comic strip Thimble Theatre by E.C. Segar on January 17 1929. At the time Thimble Theatre was almost ten years old, having debuted on December 19 1919. In the beginning the comic strip centred on a character named Ham Gravy and his girlfriend Olive Oyl. Thimble Theatre was known for its sometimes lengthy storylines, in which some characters would appear never to be used again. Popeye was one of these characters who was meant to appear for only one storyline. As it turned out, Popeye became so popular that the character was brought back only five weeks after his first appearance. Popeye was given a larger role in Thimble Theatre until eventually he was the comic strip's central character. He replaced Ham Gravy as Olive Oyl's love interest, and Ham Gravy left the comic strip, last appearing on May 12 1930.With Popeye as its new lead character, Thimble Theatre became not only one of King Features' most popular comic strips, but one of the most popular comic strips in the United States. With the success of Thimble Theatre and the popularity of Popeye, it was then natural that in November 1932 that King Features entered into an agreement with Fleischer Studios, to produce a series of cartoons starring Popeye and the other characters from Thimble Theatre. Fleischer Studios, run by brothers Max and Dave Fleischer, had already seen a good deal of success in animation. During the Silent Era they had produced the popular Out of the Inkwell series of cartoons. It was in 1930 that they introduced their most successful original character, Betty Boop. Starting in 1926, the Fleischer cartoons were distributed by Paramount Pictures.While the very first Popeye cartoon, \"Popeye the Sailor\" starred Popeye and Betty Boop only had a brief cameo, it was officially counted as part of the Betty Boop series. The first official cartoon in the series was \"I Yam What I Yam,\" released on September 29 1933. As to \"Popeye the Sailor,\" its plot was fairly simple, with Popeye and Bluto fighting over Olive Oyl, this time in a carnival setting. The theatrical short not only marked the film debuts of Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto, but also introduced the song \"I'm Popeye the Sailor Man,\" written by Sammy Lerner. The opening theme of the first few cartoons was a variation of the song \"Strike Up the Band (Here Comes a Sailor),\" written in 1900 by Andrew B. Sterling and Charles B. Ward. It had earlier been used in the 1930 Fleischer Studios Screen Songs animated short \"Strike Up the Band.\" After the first few theatrical shorts, an instrumental version of \"The Sailor's Hornpipe\" served as the first part of the opening theme, which would segue into \"I'm Popeye The Sailor Man.\" In \"Popeye the Sailor,\" Billy Costello voiced Popeye, Bonnie Poe voiced Olive Oyl, and William Pennell voiced Bluto. Mae Questrel, the actor now most associated with Olive Oyl, first voiced the character in the third cartoon, \"I Eats My Spinach,\" although Betty Poe would still voice Olive Oyl in some cartoons until 1935. Mae Questrel continued to provide voices for Fleischer Studios cartoons until 1938, when the Fleischer Brothers moved their studio from New York City to Miami. She returned to voicing Olive Oyl in 1944 after Paramount had taken over Fleischer Studios, renamed it Famous Studios, and moved everything back to New York City. As to Billy Costello, after 25 cartoons he was fired by Fleischer Studios. As the popularity of the Popeye cartoons grew, Billy Costello began to demand more money and even time off during recording sessions. He was replaced by Jack Mercer, an animator with a gift for imitating voices. Jack Mercer continued to voice Popeye until 1957 when production on the cartoons ended. Both Jack Mercer and Mae Questrel would provide voices for the series of made-for-television Popeye cartoons produced between 1960 and 1962. Jack Mercer would also voice Popeye for the 1978 Saturday morning cartoon The All-New Popeye Hour.Eventually other characters from Thimble Theatre beyond Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto would appear in the Popeye theatrical cartoons. Hamburger loving J. Wellington Wimpy first appeared in the second cartoon, \"I Yam What I Yam.\" Swee' Pea first appeared in the 1936 cartoon \"Little Swee' Pea.\" Eugene the Jeep first appeared in the 1938 cartoon \"Popeye With the Jeep.\" The Goons would only appear once in the series of animated theatrical shorts, in the 1938 cartoon \"Goonland.\"The Popeye cartoons proved to be phenomenally popular. Popeye was the undisputed star of the Fleischer Studios cartoons by 1936. As the 1930s progressed, Popeye became the most popular animated cartoon character in the country, surpassing Disney's Mickey Mouse. Fleischer Studios even created a \"Popeye Club,\" in which for 10 cents members would receive a Popeye kazoo, a membership card, and other items. Popeye would continue to be the most popular animated character even as the Thirties came to a close. During the Thirties, Fleischer Studios would produce three Popeye Colour Features. These cartoons differed from other Popeye cartoons not only in that they were in colour (at the time the Popeye series was still in black-and-white), but that they were also longer, ranging in length from 16 to 21 minutes. The first of the Popeye Colour Features, \"Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindband the Sailor,\" was released on November 27 1936 and was nominated for the 1936 Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons. The second, \"Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves,\" was released on November 26, 1937. The third and final Colour Feature, \"Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp,\" was released on April 7 1939. It was the longest of the Colour Features at 21 minutes in length.It was in May 1937 that conditions at Fleischer Studios resulted in a strike that lasted for five months. It was partly due to the strike and to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates that Fleischer Studios moved to Miami, Florida in September 1938. Production of Popeye theatrical shorts continued unabated, but some have detected differences between the cartoons produced in New York City and the ones later produced in Miami. The colours in the cartoons were brighter after the move to Miami, but the artwork was also less detailed. Despite the success of the Popeye cartoons and later the Superman cartoons, Fleischer Studios were financially in trouble for much of its history. In 1937 Paramount Studio loaned Max and Dave Fleischer the money to build a bigger studio, the goal being to produce animated features with which to compete with Disney. Neither Gulliver's Travels (1939) nor Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941) proved to be overwhelming successes at the box office. Short of money, the Fleischers continually looked to Paramount for more loans. Finally, on May 24 1941, Paramount took over Fleischer Studios, renaming the company Famous Studios. Eventually Paramount also moved production back to New York City. The Fleischers themselves remained in control of production until the end of 1941. The first Popeye cartoon released by Famous Studios was \"You're a Sap, Jap,\" on August 7 1942. One change that would be made in the character of Popeye even as Fleischer Studios was coming to an end was a change in what Popeye wore. Originally wearing the sailor suit he wore in Thimble Theatre, in \"The Mighty Navy,\" released on October 14 1941, Popeye joined the Navy and began wearing a U.S. Naval uniform. Afterwards, Popeye would appear in his original sailor suit in only two more cartoons: \"Popeye Makes a Movie\" (released on August 11 1950) and \"Big Bad Sindbad\" (released on December 12 1952). \"Big Bad Sindbad\" mostly reused footage from the 1935 Colour Feature \"Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor.\"With the exception of the three Colour Features, Popeye cartoons were produced in black and white until 1943. It was with \"Her Honour the Mare,\" released on November 2 1943, that the series began being shot in colour. While \"Her Honour the Mare\" and other cartoons in the mid-Forties were produced using Technicolor, some cartoons in the series in the late Forties used such cheaper colour processes as Cinecolor and Polacolor. Most of the animators with Fleischer Studios remained with Famous Studios, although there would be noticeable changes in the cartoons from when the Fleischers were in charge. While production values remained high for much of the Forties, many feel that the Popeye cartoons produced by Famous Studios lacked the creativity of the entries produced by Fleischer Studios. The plots of the theatrical shorts became more formulaic, as did the gags in the cartoons. Matters would grow worse in the 1950s, when Paramount downsized the staff of Famous Studios and the budgets for the Popeye cartoons and other theatrical shorts were cut. Some of the cartoons from the Fifties would even reuse footage from earlier cartoons (an example from above being \"Big Bad Sindband\" reusing footage from \"Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindband the Sailor\"). It was in 1956 that Famous Studios was renamed Paramount Cartoon Studios. Production on the Popeye cartoons would continue for one more year, with the final short, \"Spooky Swabs,\" released on August 9 1957. It was in June 1956 that Paramount sold the Popeye theatrical shorts to television distributor Associated Artists Productions. The Popeye theatrical shorts proved to be phenomenally successful on television, so much so that in 1960 King Features commissioned a new series of animated shorts made for television. These new made-for-TV cartoons would also prove to be a hit. It was in 1958 that United Artists bought Associated Artists Productions. In turn, United Artists would merge with MGM in 1981. In 1986 Ted Turner bought MGM/UA. He then sold it back to Kirk Kerkorian, but retained ownership of the MGM/UA library, including the Popeye theatrical shorts. The Popeye cartoons would air on Ted Turner's channels, such as TBS and the Cartoon Network. Turner Entertainment was acquired by Time Warner in 1996. It was in 2019 that Turner Classic Movies began airing the Popeye theatrical shorts, and they still air on the channel to this day. MeTV also shows the Popeye theatrical shorts, both on their weekday series Toon In With Me and on their Saturday morning series Popeye and Pals.Lasting for 24 years, the Popeye theatrical shorts proved to be among the most successful theatrical cartoons of all time.Much of this was perhaps due to the high quality of the Fleischer cartoons, which featured superior animation and a great deal of creativity when it came to stories  Already a popular comic strip character, the theatrical cartoons propelled Popeye to even greater heights. He ultimately became one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world."},
{"title": "The 100th Anniversary of the Hollywood Sign", "date": "Thursday, July 13, 2023", "text": "Perhaps no landmark is as identified with Hollywood and even the City of Los Angeles as a whole as the Hollywood Sign. Set atop the southern slope of Mount Lee in the Santa Monica Mountains, it is visible throughout much of Los Angeles County. It is often used in establishing shots in movies and television shows to indicate they are set in Hollywood or Los Angeles in general. It has appeared in movies from Down Three Dark Streets (1954) to Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood (2019). There is some uncertainty as to the exact date when the Hollywood Sign was dedicated, but legend has it that it was on July 13 1923. If that is the case, then the Hollywood Sign turns 100 today. Regardless, it is fairly certain that 2023 is the year of its 100th anniversary.The Hollywood Sign originated as a promotion for a new housing development. It was in the early 1920s that Eli P. Clark and Moses Sherman, both Southern California railroad tycoons, in partnership with Harry Chandler, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, and real estate developers Tracy E. Shoults and Sidney H. Woodruff, set out to develop a new hillside community called \"Hollywoodland.\" In order to advertise the new housing development, they contracted the Crescent Sign Company to build a sign reading \"HOLLYWOODLAND\" in 50 foot block letters. The original sign was made of wood and sheet metal. It's not known who exactly came up with the idea of the sign. And, as mentioned above, we aren't even certain of the date when it was dedicated. According to the Hollywood Sign Trust, the sign was completed in December 1923. It is known that the total cost of the Hollywoodland sign was $21,000 (which would be $372,516.80 today).  Originally it was lit by some 4000 electric lights, which may well have made it the largest electric sign in the world at the time. The Hollywood Sign was meant to only stand for 18 months, which makes the fact that some version of  it is still standing 100 years later all the more remarkable. It certainly outlasted the group behind the Hollywoodland development. The Great Depression was not a good time for real estate development, and the syndicate behind Hollywoodland was dissolved in 1933. Moses Sherman's company, the M.H. Sherman Company, then took over ownership of the sign. Given how much it cost to light the sign, not to mention maintain it, the M.H. Sherman Company discontinued maintenance on the Hollywood Sign that year. As it was, it was only a year earlier that the Hollywood Sign had been the site of a tragedy. On September 15 1932, actress Peg Entwistle used a workman's ladder to climb to the top of the \"H\" on the sign and jump to her death. A hiker discovered her body two days later. A suicide note was found in her purse.There have been claims that Peg Entwistle's suicide immediately made the Hollywood Sign a symbol of the dark side of the film industry, but this does not seem to be the case. It would be many years before the Hollywood Sign would become a symbol of Hollywood, the City of Los Angeles, and the American film industry in general, let alone a symbol of its dark side. Leo Braudy, author of  The Hollywood Sign: Fantasy and Reality of an American Icon, pointed out that the idea of Peg Entwistle's suicide as a tragic, but critical moment in the history of the sign did not emerge until the 1970s when the story of her death was revived because of renewed interest in the Hollywood Sign and its history.Sadly, after the M.H. Sherman Company stopped maintaining the Hollywoodland Sign, it began to deteriorate. High winds took down the sign's second \"O\" in September 1936. It would lose two more letters over the next two and a half years In 1944 the \"H\" in the sign was taken down by high winds, although at the time The Los Angeles Times considered vandals could also have been responsible and an urban legend would persist that caretaker Albert Kothe had crashed into the sign while driving his car drunk (given how steep Mount Lee's southern slope is, I think this story can be discounted). By 1947 the Hollywood Sign was in such a sorry state that the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Commission wanted it torn down. Local people protested the possible demolition of the sign and eventually the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in to save it. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce entered into a contract with the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Commission to repair the sign. It was then in September 1949 that the sign was restored and the final four letters, spelling \"LAND\" were removed so that it referred to the area and not a long defunct housing development. From that time forward, it has read \"HOLLYWOOD.\"It was in 1973 that the Hollywood Sign was declared a cultural landmark by the Los Angeles heritage commission. Unfortunately, being made of wood and sheet metal, it would continue to deteriorate. A severe windstorm on February 10, 1978 damaged the first \"O\" so that it now looked more like a \"U.\" The third \"O\" collapsed entirely. A campaign to save the sign then replaced the old sign with a new version consisting of 44 foot high letters made of steel. It was unveiled on November 11 1978. Since then the Hollywood Sign has been refurbished from time to time. In 2005 it was repainted. It was repainted again this very year, just in time for its 100th anniversary.Over the years the Hollywood Sign would fall victim to pranksters. On New Year's Day of 1976, art student Danny Finegood draped pieces of fabric over the letters of the sign so it read \"HOLLYWEED.\" In 2017 artist Zachary Cole Fernandez repeated Danny Finegood's prank. More recently, pranksters made the sign read \"Hollyboob\" in 2021. Last year many were angered (myself included) when, following the Los Angeles Ram's victory in the Super Bowl, the City of Los of Angeles itself tried making the sign read \"Rams' House.\" In 1987 Fox Broadcasting paid to have the sign altered to read \"Fox\" as promotion for their new network. I don't know if that generated any anger on the part of those who love the sign or not, but it would not surprise me if it did.Of course, the Hollywood Sign has appeared in a number of movies and television shows over the years, so many that it would be exceedingly difficult to list them all. It played a central role in the classic film noir Down Three Dark Streets (1954), with the film's climax taking place at the Hollywood Sign. It was also central to the plot of the 2001 movie The Hollywood Sign. In the disaster movie Earthquake (1978), the sign topples down as the quake takes place. In Superman (1978), another earthquake took out the Hollywood Sign. In 1941 (1979) pilot Wild Bill Kelso fired upon the sign. In The Rocketeer (1991), while operating the film's jet pack, villain Neville Sinclar (Timothy Dalton) knocks down the last four letters of the Hollywoodland Sign so that it now reads \"HOLLYWOOD.\" As mentioned above, it is often used in establishing shots, so that it has appeared in such movies as Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970), Predator 2 (1990), and Mulholland Drive (2001). It has appeared on such television shows as Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Beverly Hills 90120.While the Hollywood Sign is beloved by film buffs all over the world, as well as Los Angelenos, I have a very personal connection to it. It was on July 29 2019 the ashes of actress Vanessa Marquez were scattered atop Mount Lee at the Hollywood Sign, as per her request, by her mother, a few of her friends, and myself. Like most classic film buffs, Vanessa loved classic movies, Hollywood, and the Hollywood Sign. Essentially constructed as an advertisement and subject to neglect over many years, the Hollywood Sign has become a symbol of not only of the film industry, but of the art of cinema itself. It ceased long ago to belong to the neighbourhood of Hollywood or even the City of Los Angeles. It belongs to  anyone who loves film and loves the place where films are made. It would be difficult to find an greater symbol of the American film industry."},

She later served as a vice-president at a real estate/construction firm. She also operated a dress shop in Brentwood and a coffee shop in Beverly Hills.Margia Dean was a talented actress who really deserved better roles than she often got. She did very well in The Quatermass Xperiment, playing the wife of an ill-fated astronaut who eventually loses her mind. In The Big Show she played a circus aerialist abandoned by her sweetheart when he decides to marry someone else. She was a gifted singer and among her most notable careers was that of a saloon singer in I Shot Jesse James. She also sang in Villa!! and Frontier Gambler. Many of Margia Dean's roles during her career were small, but she was always a pleasure to see on screen."},

{"title": "The Nostalgia Channel", "date": "Saturday, July 8, 2023", "text": "Last week I wrote a post on classic movie channels that stopped being classic. Following this post, a friend reminded me of a classic movie channel I had forgotten to include in the post. Of course, in some ways it is little wonder I forgot about it, as The Nostalgia Channel is barely remembered today. It launched on February 1 1985, a mere five months after American Movie Classics.  George \"Spanky\" McFarland, of \"Our Gang\" fame,\" helped launched the channel. The Nostalgia Channel primarily showed movies from the 1920s to the 1960s. Many of the films were in the public domain, and often the prints were in poor condition. Along with feature films, it also showed such movie serials as Adventures of Captain Marvel (1941) and Zorro's Fighting Legion (1939). In between movies The Nostalgia Channel showed vintage newsreels and  retro commercials. Among its regular interstitials were Megaphone Video (short clips from classic musicals) and Nostalgia Radio Theatre (clips of Old Time Radio shows). Among the regular programming was StarClips, which profiled figures from classic movies.It was in 1990 that Michael E. Marcovsky became the CEO of the Nostalgia Channel. He changed the name to Nostalgia Television, and he also changed the format. While Nostalgia Television still showed classic movies, many of the public domain titles with poor prints were dropped. Among the films shown on Nostalgia Television were such classics as The Red Shoes (1948) and The Lavender Hill Mob (1941). Added to the programming on Nostalgia Television were lifestyle shows and vintage television series.It was in 1998 that Nostalgia Television was purchased by the Unification Church, which had owned part of the company. Its name was changed to Goodlife TV. By 2005 it was renamed again, this time to American Life TV. Throughout it all, the channel's focus shifted away from classic movies to classic television. Over time it would shift from reruns of older television shows to more recent titles such as Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere. It was in 2011 that the channel was rebranded once again, this time to Youtoo TV, with a focus primarily on mobile devices. By this point only a few classic television shows remained on the channel, including Batman, The Green Hornet, and The X-Files. By late 2019 and early 2020, YouToo TV gradually rebranded itself YTA TV, to avoid confusion with YouTube.YTA TV continues to exist to this day and is a far cry from The Nostalgia Channel. It shows nothing in the way of classic movies or classic television. Instead it shows programming such as Forensic Files, Jack Hana's Into the Wild, Pawn Stars, and Sports Stars of Tomorrow.As to why The Nostalgia Channel ceased to be solely a classic movie channel and changed its format rather often, it would seem that The Nostalgia Channel/Goodlife TV/American Life TV was not a darling of cable channels and satellite channels. It had one of the absolute lowest carriage fees of any cable channel, but often times cable channels, as well as DirecTV and Dish Network, refused to carry it. This was largely because the cable and satellite services perceived it as lacking quality programming, given much of its programming was consisted of public domain movies and older sitcoms. Indeed, the only time I have ever seen the now forgotten sitcom It's a Great Life (which ran from 1954 to 1956) was on American Life TV. Of course, another reason for the failure of The Nostalgia Channel/Goodlife TV/American Life TV was probably competition with American Movies Classics. Just as AMC would later run afoul of Turner Classic Movies, so too did The Nostalgia Channel run afoul of AMC.Regardless, I have to disagree with the various cable services and satellite services that claimed The Nostalgia Channel/Goodlife TV/American Life TV lacked quality programming. While they did show public domain movies, often with poor prints, later they would show a good amount of classic television that wasn't even seen on TV Land at the time. And quite frankly, I would rather watch an old, public domain movie with a bad print than anything on TLC any day of the week. The Nostalgia Channel/Goodlife TV/American Life TV may not have shown the sort of classics seen on American Movie Classics, TCM, or METV, but there was an audience for it nonetheless."},
{"title": "Alternatives to Twitter ", "date": "Friday, July 7, 2023", "text": "Last year billionaire Elon Musk acquired Twitter, and almost immediately began making changes to the social media site that proved unpopular with users. The upshot of all this is that several new alternatives to Twitter have emerged, while an older Twitter rival has seen an influx of new users. Here are some of the various alternatives to Twitter currently available. BlueSky Social:  BlueSky Social is a decentralized social network protocol that includes Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on its board of directors. At the moment one can only join BlueSky by invite only. While the media has publicized BlueSky a good deal, from what I have read and heard from the few people I know who are on it, BlueSky has had its share of problems. Unless they have made changes in the past few weeks, BlueSky does not have a button to block other users, one of the most basic and desired features in a social media service. I have also read that as of yet they do not have direct messages. As to content moderation at BlueSky Social, thus far it has been a work in progress. BlueSky recently published a set of Community Guidelines that are set to take effect on July 14 2023. As to the presence of trolls on BlueSky, I have read conflicting accounts. Some claim trolls are unknown there, while others claim they are very common. Hive Social: The first version of Hive was launched in the Apple App Store in October 2019. It was followed by a beta Android version in November 2022. As of yet, there is no version of Hive Social for the web, which could keep away some users away (I know I prefer to access social media services on my computer, not my phone). The German hacker collective Zerforschung raised concerns about security issues at Hive Social on November 30 2022, in which personal data, private posts, and even deleted direct messages could possibly be accessed through a hack. Hive Social shut down for a time to fix the problems.Beyond the security issues raised last fall, I really have not heard too much about Hive Social. I do know that it has no character limit on posts, which many might not find desirable in a microblogging site. Mastodon: Mastodon is the oldster among the Twitter alternatives listed here. It was launched in March 2016. Mastodon is not really one social media service, but a  federated network of self-hosted social media services (the various servers are referred to as \"instances\"). That is to say, it is decentralized. Mastodon has received its share of criticism for its structure, which some perceive as making moderation difficult.  I have been on Mastodon since October 2022. Largely because of Mastodon's decentralized nature, I know there have been concerns expressed about its content moderation in the past. That having been said, I have not encountered many trolls since I have been there and I have not seen any major problems as of yet. Of course, here I have to point out that I can really only speak for the instance I am on and the instances my followers are on. There could be Mastodon instances where they do have problems with trolls and so on.I also have to point out that Mastodon lacks anything similar to \"quote tweets,\" a feature common to other microbloggers. Also, its direct messaging is not truly private, as a Mastodon moderator can read them. Post: I have to admit that I know very little about Post, also known as Post.news. It launched in late 2022. Post is open to anyone, but its primary focus is news and the discussion of news. I am not sure, but I do believe that Post can be accessed through the web. They have an app available for IPhones, but as of yet they don't have an Android app. One thing that separates Post from other microblogging services is that journalists and news outlets can post articles that are behind a paywall. That is, users pay to read the article. I am not sure about the various features on Post, but last I heard they did not have direct messaging yet.Spill: Spill is one of the newest microblogging services, having just launched in June 2023. Spill has two Black founders, namely former Twitter employees Alphonzo “Phonz” Terrell and DeVaris Brown. In a video interview, Mr. Terrell said of Spill, \"We are here to build a place that centres Black folks, queer folks and other marginalized groups, we're not tolerating any hate.\" Spill's feed has two tabs. On the left is what is called \"Fresh Tea,\" which consists of trending posts, and on the right is \"My Brew,\" which is posts from people one follows. The one drawback is that currently Spill is only available through Apple, although an Android app is in development. As of yet, it can't be accessed on the web.Spoutible: Spoutible is one of the microblogging services listed here that I am on and I have already written about it on this blog. Spoutible was launched in February 2023 and founded by Christopher Bouzy, who had earlier founded Bot Sentinel (an analytics service that tracks disinformation, inauthentic behaviour, and harassment on Twitter). Along with Spill, it is a Black owned social media service. Spoutible's focus is on protecting its users, and it relies on the same technology as Bot Sentinel to help fight against disinformation and targeted harassment.Spoutible resembles Twitter a good deal. It has its equivalent of retweets (called \"echoes\") and quote tweets (called quote echoes). It has its equivalent of Trends (called \"Making Waves\") as well. It also has direct messaging. One big difference between Twitter and Spoutible is that there is no feed sorted by algorithm. Its feed is sorted in reverse chronological order. Given how many of us hate feeds sorted by algorithm, this is actually an asset. Another difference between Spoutible and Twitter is that on Spoutible one can edit a spout (as posts are called) up to seven minutes after having posted it. This is very useful in correcting typos. Spoutible is available on the web, and it has apps for both Android and Apple. I have been on Spoutible since April and I am thoroughly enjoying it. I have not experienced any harassment there and it seems as if trolls are dealt with very swiftly. Proportionately, it seems to me there is more in the way of people of colour on Spoutible. I have actually encountered proportionately more people of Native descent there than on other social media sites. What is more, the users on Spoutible seem much more willing to interact with each other. I have fewer followers on Spoutible than on some social media sites, but I have much more in the way of interaction.Threads: Threads is Meta's new service meant to compete with Twitter. The media has hyped Threads, often referring to it as a \"Twitter Killer.\" I don't think it is anything of a kind. First, Threads is little more than an extension of Instagram. In order to have a Threads account, one must first have an Instagram account. In fact, one's Threads account has the same user name, password, and account name as their Instagram account. Of course, this means that if someone deletes their Threads account, their Instagram account will be deleted as well (or vice versa). I rather suspect most people who do not already have Instagram will not create an account just to use Threads.Second, like Instagram, one's Threads feed is displayed by algorithm and there is no way to display the feed in reverse chronological order. While Twitter has its own algorithm sorted feed, I know of no one who uses it. Indeed. for those who get their news from social media, a feed sorted by algorithm is useless when it comes to breaking stories. A feed sorted by algorithm is also useless when it comes to live posting movies, TV shows, and events. #TCMParty originated on Twitter and has expanded to other microblogging sites. I can't see it expanding to Threads. Anyway, it would seem that when it comes to microblogging services like Twitter and Mastodon, people prefer their feeds to be displayed in reverse chronological fashion. Indeed, I have to point out that people have been complaining about Instagram's algorithm sorted feed ever since it was introduced in 2016. Third, to make one's Threads feed even worse, it displays posts from accounts one does not even follow. This happens at times on Instagram with suggested posts, although one can dismiss them for thirty days at a time there. I have not heard this is the case with Threads. Fourth, Threads does not use hashtags, something common to nearly every other microblogging service, from Twitter to Tumblr. This seems a bit strange, given Meta's two major products, Instagram and Facebook (where hashtags are rarely used), do. Fourth, Threads does not have yet other features common to Twitter and other similar social media services. It does not have direct messaging or a web version. Fifth, there have been privacy concerns with regards to Facebook and Instagram for years. Both social media services are notorious for gathering data on their users. Many people have neither a Facebook account nor an Instagram account for precisely that reason. Even some individuals who already have Facebook or Instagram might not be willing to join Threads out of concerns for privacy. Quite simply, it appears to be even more invasive than either FB or Instagram. The app collects data on one's health and fitness, financial information, browsing history, purchases, contacts, and so on. Indeed, Threads is not currently available in the European Union, in part because it doesn't comply with the EU's regulatons regarding privacy. Here I have to point out that this is not the first time Meta/Facebook has tried something similar to Twitter. In fact, it is not even the first time they have tried something called \"Threads.\" In 2021 a \"Threads\" option was introduced on Facebook itself. It operated similar to Twitter threads, in which additional new posts could be linked to an initial post. That version of Threads never took off and was gone by the end of 2021. While millions of people have downloaded the 2023 Threads app, I don't think it will turn out to be the \"Twitter Killer\" the media seems to think it will be. It is clear that Threads is unsatisfactory for many Twitter users, who will be more likely to try one of the other Twitter alternatives.It is clear that, at least as long as Elon Musk remains in control of Twitter, that its days are numbered. At the same time, it is also clear that people still want microblogging services like Twitter. It remains to be seen if any one of the emerging Twitter alternatives will dominate the others or if there will be number of alternatives going forward."},
{"title": "Spectrum Choice", "date": "Wednesday, July 5, 2023", "text": "Last week I received a piece of mail from Spectrum, who provide both internet and cable television for my house. It let us know that after August 7 2023 our internet speed would be increased to 100 Mbps. That was the good news. The bad news is that our bill would go up slightly and we would be shifted to a new cable package (ours no longer being offered). Furthermore, they would be adding a few channels to our line up and dropping a few as well. Unfortunately, among the channels being dropped from our line up is Turner Classic Movies.Now I don't know if TCM has been bumped up to a higher tier or if it's not being offered on any of Spectrum's cable packages. Either way it doesn't matter, as we really cannot afford to pay any more for internet and cable television than we already do. Fortunately, it turns out that Turner Classic Movies is still available through Spectrum and, what is more, we can actually reduce our bill almost by half.Quite simply, being upset at the prospect of losing TCM, I called Spectrum. Their customer service representative (who was very nice) told me about Spectrum's new live streaming service called Spectrum Choice. One automatically receives their local channels and can pick 15 additional channels, of which Turner Classic Movies is one of them. It cost only $29.99 (as opposed to the $59.99 we were paying for our cable package). One can add the premium channels HBO, Starz, Showtime, and The Movie Channel for an additional fee. Now Spectrum Choice certainly is not for everyone and I can see how some people might not think it is worth it. As for myself,  not having TCM is a deal breaker. It is the one cable channel I must absolutely have. For me, having over 125 channels is not worth it if it means I cannot have Turner Classic Movies. In addition to keeping TCM, it also means we won't be paying for a ton of channels we never watch, such as the various sports channels or Fox \"News.\" I do have to admit that given recent events it does concern me that Spectrum has either bumped TCM up to a higher tier or done away with it entirely. Now more than ever it seems important that cable companies have Turner Classic Movies available on their lower priced line ups. I realize that as TCM is commercial free that its carriage fees may not be cheap, but I would gladly pay more for fewer channels if one of them is TCM. As it is, I have to think many people here in Randolph County will either switch to Spectrum Choice (effectively doing away with their cable package entirely) or switch to one of Spectrum's competitors (here in Huntsville we have two cable companies to choose from--the other one still has TCM). Regardless, I am just glad I don't have to give up TCM or switch to another cable company to get it."},

{"title": "I Wake Up Screaming ", "date": "Saturday, July 1, 2023", "text": "(This post is part of the Betty Grable Blogathon hosted by Taking Up Room)I Wake Up Screaming (1941) is notable for three reasons. First, it is one of the earliest movies that would later be called film noir. In fact, it is often counted as the first film noir made at 20th Century Fox. Second, it stars Betty Grable in a rare dramatic role. Both prior to and following I Wake Up Screaming (1941), she primarily did musicals and comedies. Third, it was an early role for Victor Mature. It was Mr. Mature's fifth movie and he considered it his first \"real\" movie.I Woke Up Screaming (1941) starred Betty Grable as Jill Lynn, whose sister Vicky (Carole Landis) signs with a Hollywood producer. It is not long afterwards that Vicki is murdered. Jill then teams up with Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), a sports promoter who sought to turn Vicky into a star and was accused of her murder to solve the mystery of Vicky's murder. This was not the first time that Betty Grable and Carole Landis had played sisters. They had also done so in the musical Moon Over Miami (1941). Of course, Miss Landis had previously appeared with Victor Mature in the caveman movie One Million B.C. (1940).I Wake Up Screaming (1941) was based on the novel of the same name by Steve Fisher. Steve Fisher wrote for several pulp magazines, including Black Mask, Detective Story Magazine, Doc Savage, The Phantom Detective, and The Shadow. He later broke into slick magazines such as Colliers, Liberty, and The Saturday Morning Post before publishing novels. The movie I Wake Up Screaming  would see some changes from the novel. The novel is set in Hollywood, but Darryl F. Zanuck changed the setting to New York City because he did not like stories set in Hollywood. While the movie originally bore the same title as the novel, Zanuck changed the movie's title to Hot Spot. It was under the title Hot Spot  that it was previewed in Pasadena, California. The preview bombed as the audience expected a musical, largely because of its star Betty Grable. The movie was then edited and its title changed back to the more fitting I Woke Up Screaming.Betty Grable was not the only actress considered for the role of Jill in I Wake Up Screaming (1941). Rita Hayworth and Gene Tierney had also been considered. Producer Milton Sperling decided on the unusual choice of Betty Grable, who was happy to play the role. Early on Lucille Ball was considered for the role of Vicky, which ultimately went to Carole Landis. George Raft and Cesar Romero had expressed interest in the role of Frankie Christopher, which ultimately went to Victor Mature. It was Mr. Mature's first film under his contract with 20th Century Fox. He would follow I Woke Up Screaming (1941) with another early noir, The Shanghai Gesture (1941).In some respects, Betty Grable's role as Jill is not that far off from her characters in musicals and comedies. Jill is as wholesome as many of the other characters Miss Grable played. Originally she was even set to do a bit of singing in I Wake Up Screaming (1941), a scene in which she sings \"Daddy\" by songwriter Harold Arlen in a record store, but the scene was ultimately cut from the completed movie. And Darryl F. Zanuck made sure to take advantage of Betty Grable's already famous legs and Victor Mature's muscles. I Wake Up Screaming (1941), features a scene set at a swimming pool in which both are wearing swimsuits. Betty Grable was not particularly happy about the scene, saying it \"...could just as easily have taken place in a drug store or a bar, but Zanuck would have me and Victor strip down. I loathed that scene.\"Beyond Betty Grable, Victor Mature, and Carole Landis, I Wake Up Screaming (1941) featured other notable actors in its cast. Elisha Cook Jr. would make a career out of appearing in film noirs, and by the time he appeared in I Wake Up Screaming (1941) he had already appeared in Stranger on the Third Floor (1940), considered by some to be the first true film noir, and The Maltese Falcon (1941). Laird Creager played the none-too-nice police detective Ed Cornell. He would also go onto appear in the classic film noir This Gun for Hire (1942).I Wake Up Screaming (1941) was well received by critics. It was also well received by audiences. The movie proved to be a hit and made  a profit of $574,100. The film still remains well respected to this day. Director H. Bruce Humberstone had earlier directed several \"Charlie Chan\" movies and such lighter fare as the comedies Pardon Our Nerve (1939) and The Quarterback (1940), but with I Wake Up Screaming (1941) he seems totally at home with film noir. Aside from featuring the archetypal noir plot of someone wrongly accused of murder, I Wake Up Screaming (1941) also features the shadows and low-key lighting that would come to define noir. H. Bruce Humberstone would never make another film noir, instead making musicals such as Wonder Man (1945) and The Desert Song (1953).Following I Wake Up Screaming (1941) Betty Grable would have little opportunity to play dramatic roles. As the Forties progressed, she became established as a musical and comedic star, not to mention a wholesome pinup girl. As wonderful as Miss Grable was in musical comedies, in some ways this is sad. She did a wonderful job in I Wake Up Screaming, and it would be interesting to have seen her in other dramatic roles."},

{"title": "The Corner Bar: A Historic, But Forgotten Sitcom", "date": "Thursday, June 29, 2023", "text": "Bill Fiore, Vincent Schiavelli, & Gabriel DellChances are very good that not many remember or have even heard of the sitcom The Corner Bar. It was a summer replacement series that debuted on ABC on June 21 1972. After running for 10 episodes during the summer of 1972, it was retooled for its second season of six episodes in the late summer of 1973. While the show was not successful and is not well remembered, The Corner Bar is historic in featuring the first recurring gay character.The Corner Bar was created by comedian Alan King and veteran television writer Herb Sargent, who had previously worked on such shows as The Steve Allen Show That Was the Week That Was. Among its producers was Howard Morris, veteran of Your Show of Shows and Ernest T. Bass on The Andy Griffith Show. By 1972 Mr. Morris had already directed many hours of television. The Corner Bar starred Gabriel Dell as Harry Grant, who bought a bar in New York City called Grant's Tomb. Its premise was much like the classic radio show Duffy's Tavern or the classic sitcom Cheers insofar that it centred on the various patrons of Grant's Tomb, although it tended to be much more topical.Among the patrons who frequented Grant's Tomb was Peter Panama, Broadway set designer who dressed flamboyantly. Peter was played by Vincent Schiavelli, who would go on to appear in the movies One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982). Peter Panama was the first recurring character to appear on an American television show who was openly gay. The Corner Bar could have then been said to have been a step forward in representation for homosexual characters except for one thing. Quite simply, from all reports Peter Panama was an outright stereotype.Indeed, the character was not at all well received by the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA), then the most influential gay activist organization. The group referred to Peter Panama as an \"effeminate, inaccurate stereotype of the male homosexual.\" Richard Wandel, then president of the GAA, said of Peter Panama, \"However, we cannot accept this ludicrous stereotype. No more than the Black community would accept a watermelon-eating, tap-dancing stereotype of a Black man.\" When The Corner Bar returned for a second season on August 3 1973, Peter Panama was no longer part of the cast, although it is doubtful that his absence was due to any controversy over the character. Quite simply, The Corner Bar had been almost completely overhauled. Grant's Tomb was now owned by Mae (Anne Meara) and Frank Flynn (Eugene Roche). Only the characters Fred Costello (J. J. Barry), Phil Bracken (Bill Fiore), and Meyer Shapiro (Shimen Ruskin) were retained for the second season. Retooling The Corner Bar ultimately failed to help the show in the ratings. It did not return for a third season.While The Corner Bar was a failure and Peter Panama was rejected by the gay community, the Seventies would see gay representation improve throughout the decade of the Seventies. It was later in 1972 that the television movie That Certain Summer aired on ABC, considered by many to be the first sympathetic portrayal of homosexuals on American television. On The Mary Tyler Moore Show episode \"My Brother's Keeper,\" which aired on January 13 1973, Robert Moore, guest starred as Phyllis's brother Ben, who just happens to be gay. Like That Certain Summer, it would also be a sympathetic portrayal of a gay man. While homosexual stereotypes would continue to appear on American television well in the Eighties, as the Seventies progressed there was also an increase in more realistic, more sympathetic portrayal of homosexuals. Today The Corner Bar remains largely unavailable. At only sixteen episodes it was never rerun. It also seems unlikely to ever appear on streaming services. Currently, it would appear that the UCLA Film and Television Archive, which has one episode each from the two seasons, is the only place anyone can see even a portion of The Corner Bar. Regardless, while largely unavailable and forgotten, The Corner Bar was historic."},

{"title": "Classic Movie Channels That Ceased to Be \"Classic\"", "date": "Tuesday, June 27, 2023", "text": "Last week the many layoffs at Turner Classic Movies alarmed TCM fans. Almost immediately, a campaign to save Tuner Classic Movies was launched. While there have been reassurances from the hosts, well know filmmakers Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Paul Thomas Anderson, and even Warner Discovery itself, TCM fans remain concerned that Turner Classic Movies could be changed beyond all recognition or even closed entirely. Given the history of classic movie channels in the Untied States, it is very difficult to argue that TCM fans don't have reason to be concerned.Indeed, the very reason many TCM fans may be worried about Turner Classic Movies is the history of AMC, which began life as American Movie Classics. American Movie Classics was launched on October 1 1984. Its original focus was classic movies made before the 1950s, in contrast to TCM which from its launch was  intended to show not only films from the Silent Era, the Thirties, Forties, and Fifties, but movies from the Sixties, Seventies, and Eighties as well. In other respects, however, American Movie Classic was TCM before there was a TCM. Like TCM, American Movie Classics had hosts who would introduce movies on the channel, most notably Bob Dorian, but also Nick Clooney and Gene Klavan. Like TCM, American Movie Classics would sometimes show marathons of related movies (for example, the Marx Brothers films). Like TCM, American Movies also had its own original programming devoted to classic cinema, such as the interview show Classic Stories from Classic Stars and Star Facts. American Movie Classics even had a programming block not unlike TCM Underground or Noir Alley. American Pop! was devoted to youth-oriented films from the Fifties and Sixties (for example, the \"Beach Party\" movies). Much like Turner Classic Movies, American Movie Classic was involved with film preservation. It even had its annual Film Preservation Festival, devoted to preserving rare film that was organized with The Film Foundation. Unfortunately, American Movie Classics would not last as a classic movie channel. Originally the channel had shown movies without commercial interruption much like TCM. It was in 1998 that AMC began showing commercials between films. By 2001 commercials were being shown during movie broadcasts. It was in 2002 that American Movie Classics was rebranded as simply \"AMC\" and shifted from showing only classic movies to showing movies from all eras. Over time AMC would drift almost entirely from showing older movies to showing movies from the Eighties, Nineties, Naughts, and Teens. As to AMC's shift away from classic movies, at least part of the reason may have been due to competition from Turner Classic Movies. Founded in 1994 and able to draw upon those libraries owned by Warner, among them the Warner Bros. library and the MGM library, TCM proved to be stiff competition for American Movie Classics.Another classic movie channel to drift away from showing classic movies is the FX Movie Channel. It was launched on October 31 1994 as fxM: Movies from Fox. Its focus was classic movies from the 20th Century Fox library. Like American Movie Classics and Turner Classic Movies, in the beginning movies were shown commercial free. It was in 2000 that the channel's name was changed to the less awkward Fox Movie Channel. Fox Movie Channel's status as a channel that only showed classic movies came to an end in 2012. Its programming was divided into two programming blocks: from 3:00 AM to 3:00 PM Eastern it would show classic movies, while from 3:00 PM to 3:00 AM Eastern it would show more recent films. It was the same time that Fox Movie Channel started showing commercials. While the channel would change its name back to FXM in 2014, it has continued to show the two programming blocks of recent movies from late afternoon to early morning and classic movies from early morning to late afternoon.A third channel that drifted away from showing classic movies is a broadcast channel rather than a cable channel as AMC, TCM, and FXM are. getTV was launched February 3 2014 by Sony Pictures as a digital broadcast channel devoted to classic movies. getTV would cease being solely a classic movie channel rather early in its history. In 2016 its programming expanded to classic television as well as classic movies. Over time getTV would drift entirely away from showing classic movies to concentrate on showing classic TV shows. Among the shows currently on getTV are The Rockford Files, Sanford and Son, and Nichols.Given the histories of FXM, getTV, and particularly AMC, it is easy to understand why TCM fans are anxious when it comes to the future of Turner Classic Movies. And I am not going to say my fellow TCM fans have no reason for concern, particularly given I am worried about Turner Classic Movies as well. Even so, I think we do have some reasons for hope. First, TCM is in a much better position than AMC was in the late Nineties and early Naughts. Turner Classic Movies is still received by many homes across the United States. At the end of 2020 68.2 million homes received TCM. Furthermore, it really has no competition. There simply aren't any other channels out there devoted solely to airing classic movies, let airing them commercial free. Second, as seen in the ongoing outcry at the layoffs at Turner Classic Movies, TCM has a large and fiercely loyal fandom. Indeed, for many of us TCM isn't merely a classic movie channel, it is a way of life. What is more, it isn't just we fiercely loyal TCM fans (who might quite rightfully be called \"fanatics\") who were angered by last week's layoffs, but even casual fans like my brother. In nearly gutting TCM, Warner Discovery awakened a sleeping giant, and I think they are well aware of that. Third, while Turner Classic Movies may not generate the revenue that some of Warner Discovery's other channels do, it has always made a profit. What is more, its production costs are considerably lower than many of Warner Discovery's other channels. Shutting down TCM or changing its format would be in effect looking a gift horse in the mouth. Despite the fact that nearly every other classic movie channel drifted away from showing classic movies or only showing classic movies, I think it is quite possible that Turner Movie Classics could continue showing classic movies for many years to come. Right now I think it is important that we fans do not give up hope and that we continue to apply pressure to Warner Discovery. It's time they realize how special TCM really is.Epilogue: If you want to write the Warner Discovery Board of Directors, you can do so at Board of Directors; Warner Discovery; c/o Office of the Corporate Secretary; 230 Park Avenue South; New York City, New York 10003. If you do write them, please be firm, but remain polite and please refrain from insults or any demeaning language. Simply let them know how much you love TCM and if they close TCM or attempt to change it beyond recognition, you will not watch any of their other channels. No TLC, no Discovery Channel, no HGTV. Right now it is difficult to determine how much danger TCM is in, but I believe we can save it."},
{"title": "The Radio Show Escape", "date": "Saturday, June 24, 2023", "text": "Paul Frees, one of the narratorsof Escape Escape is counted by many Old Time Radio aficionados among the greatest radio shows of all time. This is impressive given that it rarely had a regular time slot. It might disappear for weeks at a time to reappear in a whole, new time slot. It also aired without a sponsor, except for five months in 1950 when it was sponsored by Richfield Oil. Regardless, it proved to be somewhat popular. Debuting on CBS on July 7 1947, it ran until September 25 1954.In many respects Escape was a sister show to the legendary anthology series Suspense. It was created by William N. Robeson, and by his own admission, Escape was \"pretty darned close to Suspense. Even so, there were some fundamental differences between Suspense and Escape, beyond the fact that Suspense had a regular time slot and sponsors. Quite simply, while Suspense was devoted to thrillers and mystery, Escape was devoted to adventure. Another difference between the two shows was that while Suspense mostly featured original radio plays with the occasional adaptation of a novel, short story, or play, Escape mostly featured adaptations of a novel, short story or play with the occasional original radio play.In keeping with its focus on adventure, episodes of the show would begin with the strains of Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky accompanied by an introduction voiced by William Conrad and later Paul Frees, \"Tired of the everyday grind? Ever dream of a life of romantic adventure? Want to get away from it all? We offer you...Escape!\" While Escape was devoted to adventure stories, it featured episodes in a wide variety of genres. There were adaptations of classic action adventure yarns, including The Man Who Would Be King by Rudyard Kipling and \"The Most Dangerous Game\" by Richard Connell. There were also adaptations of works of science fiction, including The Time Machine by H. G. Wells and \"Mars is Heaven\" by Ray Bradbury. Other episodes would have been right at home on Suspense, with adaptations of Orient Express by Graham Greene, \"The Lost Special\" by Arthur Conan Doyle, and The Great Impression by  E. Phillips Oppenheim, Yet other episodes fell in the category of horror, including \"Casting the Runes\" by M. R. James, \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" by Edgar Allan Poe, \"The Birds\" by Daphne du Maurier. Some of the stories used on Escape would later be used on Suspense.Episodes of Escape featured some well known actors, including Art Carney, Jack Webb, Hans Conreid, Jeff Corey, and Vincent Price, among others. Both William Conrad and Paul Frees, who served as narrators on the show at various times, would star in episodes. Like Suspense, Escape also made its way to television. The television adaptation was handled by Wyllis Cooper, the legendary creator of the radio show Lights Out.  It was narrated by William Conrad. It would also feature some well known actors, including Kim Stanley, Lee Marvin, and Brian Keith. Unfortunately, the television version of Escape would not prove as successful as either the radio version of Escape or the television version of its sister show Suspense. Debuting on CBS on January 5 1950, it ended its run on March 30 1950 after thirteen episodes.Escape aired one last time on September 25 1954. Its final episode was \"The Heart of Kali.\" The majority of the 228 episodes of Escape have survived in good condition and are widely available on CD from Old Time Radio sites and on streaming sites as well. If you are ever tired of the everyday grind, then you can find Escape."},
{"title": "Save TCM", "date": "Friday, June 23, 2023", "text": "It was earlier this week that news of layoffs at Tuner Classic Movies broke. Among those laid off were Pola Changnon, general manager of TCM (who had been with the channel for 25 years), Charles Tabesh, senior vice president in charge of content and programming (who had been with TCM from the beginning), Genevieve McGillicuddy, vice president of enterprises and strategic partnerships (who organized the annual TCM Classic Film Festival), and Anne Wilson, vice president of studio production. The layoffs sent shock waves throughout TCM fandom, with many concerned that Turner Classic Movies may not have long to last. The hashtag SaveTCM began trending on Twitter and was still trending as of today. A campaign to save TCM by emailing David Zaslav and writing the Warner Discovery Board of Directors started almost immediately. News of the layoffs was followed almost immediately by news that directors Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Paul Thomas Anderson, all of them ardent supporters of TCM, had met with David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Discovery, to discuss the future of the cable channel. The three directors issued a joint statement which said, among other things, \"We are heartened and encouraged by the conversations we've had thus far, and we are committed to working together to ensure the continuation of this cultural touchstone that we all treasure.\" This statement allayed some of the fears held by many TCM fans, particularly given it came from Martin Scorsese, one of the most beloved figures in classic film fandom. Still, many TCM fans remain concerned that even if Turner Classic Movies is not closed down, it could be changed beyond all recognition. Hence the reason that the campaign to save TCM continues and the hashtag SaveTCM is continuing to trend on Twitter.The fact is that if Turner Classic Movies were closed or if it was changed from what it has been for the past 29 years, it would be an enormous loss to the classic film community and to the cause of film preservation. As it is, laying off many of those responsible for the curation of films on TCM cannot help the channel in the short or long run. Indeed, not only do TCM fans know who Pola Changon, Charles Tabesh, and Genevieve McGillicuddy are, but we hold them in high esteem.Some fans were even privileged to call them friends. Those laid off were fellow classic film fans who insured that TCM continued its mission of showing classic films and never succumbed to  the temptation to show only the latest hits.Indeed, while many of us discovered classic cinema on the independent television stations that proliferated in the Seventies and Eighties, there is a whole generation that discovered classic films on TCM. I don't know how many of my fellow TCM fans are Millennials or Zoomers who discovered the wonderful world of classic movies on the channel. The stereotype that TCM only appeals to an older audience is very, very false. For those of us who were already classic movie fans when TCM debuted in 1994, Turner Classic Movies would introduce us to many classics we had never seen before. TCM is where I first saw Baby Face (1933), It Happened on 5th Avenue (1947), Mystery Street (1950), The Loved One (1960), and many other favourites. Without Turner Classic Movies, my experience of classic movies would be much, much poorer.Of course, Turner Classic Movies is much more than a cable channel. It is even more than a brand. For many of us it is an extension of our identities. We identify as TCM fans and we feel camaraderie with other TCM fans. And for many of us TCM has made a huge difference in our lives. I discovered many of my closest friends through TCM fandom, most through TCMParty, the informal group of fans who live tweet films shown on TCM using the hashtag of that name (and of which I was one of the original members). It was through TCMParty that I met the single most important person in my life, Vanessa Marquez. When Vanessa was murdered nearly five years ago, it was Turner Classic Movies and my fellow TCM fans who helped me get through those dark days following her death. I truly don't think I would be alive if it had not been for TCM and my fellow fans.What is more, mine is not an isolated case. Others like me believe that TCM saved their lives. TCM has been a comfort to many suffering not only from grief, but from illness, divorce, or the loss of a job. Quite simply, Turner Classic Movies is a positive force in people's lives and it makes people's lives better. It has had an enormous impact on its fans. I don't think the same thing can be said about TLC or VH1 (at least in their current forms). For those of you who want to save Turner Classic Movies, I would suggest writing the Warner Brothers Discovery Board of Directors at Board of Directors; Warner Discovery; c/o Office of the Corporate Secretary; 230 Park Avenue South; New York City, New York 10003. You can also email David Zaslav (if you're a TCM fan you have probably already seen his email address on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter--just search #SaveTCM). While I know many of you are angry (I know I am), by all means please be polite. Insults and disrespect won't accomplish anything. Simply explain why TCM is important and how it has had an impact on your life. I have already emailed David Zaslav. I plan to write the Board of Directors tomorrow.Turner Classic Movies is different from other cable channels not only in that it shows classic movies, but in that it is an integral part of its fans' lives. Indeed, I have friends and acquaintances who work for the channel, and I am hardly alone in that. In many ways TCM and its employees, from the hosts to those working behind the scenes, are like family. More importantly, Turner Classic Movies has introduced new generations to classic cinema and proven pivotal in the preservation of classic movies. To lose TCM would not simply be a loss to TCM fans or the film industry, but to all of us."},
{"title": "\"Life on Mars?\" by David Bowie", "date": "Thursday, June 22, 2023", "text": "It was fifty years ago today that David Bowie's song \"Life on Mars?\" was released as a single. The song originally appeared on his 1971 album Hunky Dory. The song originated as a parody of \"My Way\" by Frank Sinatra. Despite the title, the song is not about the planet Mars or any life that might be there. When Hunky Dory was released, Davie Bowie summed \"Life on Mars?\" up as \"A sensitive young girl's reaction to the media.\" This can be seen in such lyrics as \"...And she's hooked to the silver screen\"and \"Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know/He's in the best selling show.\"\"Life on Mars?\" went to no. 3 on the UK singles chart. Upon its initial release it did not chart in the United States. It remains one of David Bowie's best known songs and is considered by many to number among his best. The British TV series Life on Mars took its name from the song and featured it often. It has also appeared on various other TV shows and movies as well."},

From the Gainsborough melodramas to Hammer Films to the British New Wave, cinema would be much poorer without the British.Here are the ground rules for this year's blogathon:1. Posts can be about any British film or any topic related to British films. For the sake of simplicity, I am using \"British\" here to refer to any film made by a company based in the United Kingdom or British Crown dependencies. If you want to write about a film made in Northern Ireland or the Isle of Man, then, you can do so. Also for the sake of simplicity, people can write about co-productions made with companies from outside the United Kingdom. For example, since 2001: A Space Odyssey is a British-American co-production, someone could write about it if they chose.2. There is no limit on subject matter. You can write about any film in any genre you want. Posts can be on everything from the British New Wave to the Gainsborough bodice rippers to the Hammer Horrors. I am also making no limit on the format posts can take. You could review a classic British film, make an in-depth analysis of a series of British films, or even simply do a pictorial tribute to a film. That having been said, since this is a classic film blogathon,  I only ask that you write about films made before 2013. I generally don't think of a film as a classic until it has been around for thirty years, but to give bloggers more options I am setting the cut off point at ten years ago.3. I am asking that there please be no duplicates. That having been said, if someone has already chosen to cover From Russia with Love (1963), someone else could write about the James Bond series as a whole.4. I am not going to schedule days for individual posts. All I ask is that the posts be made on or between September 22, 23, and 24 2023.If you want to participate in the Rule, Britannia Blogathon, you can simply comment below or get a hold of me on Twitter at mercurie80 or at my email:  mercurie80 at gmail.comBelow is a roster of the participants:A Shroud of Thoughts: Local Hero (1983)The Stop Button: A Matter of Life and DeathRealweegiemidget Reviews:  Melody (1971)Taking Up Room: The Lady Vanishes (1938)In the Good Old Days of Classic Hollywood: Tiger Bay (1959)The Midnite Drive-In: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003)Films From Beyond the Time Barrier: Island of Terror (1966)Silver Screenings: Gaslight (1940)Moon in Gemini: Day of the TriffidsClassic Movie Man: The Forbidden StreetPaula's Cinema Club: Midsomer MurdersDubsism: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)Make Mine Film Noir: The Third Man (1949)Liberal England: Tunes of Glory (1960)The Wonderful World of Cinema: The Italian Job (1969)By Rich Watson: The Red Shoes (1948)Shadows and Satin: It  Always Rains on Sunday (1947)Whimsically Classic: Brief Encounter (1945)Below are graphics you can use for the blogathon or you can always make your own!"},
{"title": "The 75th Anniversary of The Ed Sullivan Show", "date": "Tuesday, June 20, 2023", "text": "It was 75 years ago today, on June 20 1948, that The Ed Sullivan Show debuted on CBS under the title Toast of the Town. Ed Sullivan was a well known syndicated entertainment columnist. He had already hosted multiple radio shows, the first of which debuted in 1932. From 1943 to 1944 he hosted the radio show Ed Sullivan Entertains, a variety show which served as a template for his television show. It was Marlo Lewis, then with the Blaine Thompson Advertising agency, who convinced CBS to hire Ed Sullivan as the host of a weekly variety show in 1948.The show debuted under the title Toast of the Town, but was known informally as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\"years before it was officially retitled The Ed Sullivan Show on September 25 1955. It featured its own regular performers, including ventriloquist Señor Wences and the Italian mouse puppet Topo Gigio. The Ed Sullivan Show was well known for its wide variety of performers, from acrobatic troupes to performances from Broadway shows to the latest, popular music acts. It was notable for the live television debuts of many notable performers, including Martin and Lewis, Bob Hope, Dinah Shore, Fred Astaire, Eddie Fisher, The Beatles, and The Beach Boys, among others.The Ed Sullivan Show proved to be a hit for CBS and ran for 24 seasons. It was still popular when it was cancelled in 1971 as part of the Rural Purge. Quite simply, most of its viewers were too old, older than the key demographic of 18 to 54 desired by the networks and advertisers. As it is, The Ed Sullivan Show probably would not have survived much longer. It was in September 1974 that Ed Sullivan was diagnosed with an advanced stage of oesophageal cancer. He died on October 13 1974 at the age of 73. Of course, one could not have The Ed Sullivan Show without Ed Sullivan.On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of The Ed Sullivan Show I wrote a much more detailed post. You can read it here."},
{"title": "Happy Juneteenth 2023", "date": "Monday, June 19, 2023", "text": "The Juneteenth flag designed by Ben Haith in 1997.Today is Juneteenth, also known as Emancipation Day, Freedom Day, and Juneteenth Independence Day. It was on January 1 1863  that Abraham Lincoln issued the final Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all enslaved people in the Confederate States of America. It would take some time to enforce the Proclamation in more remote areas. It was then on June 19 1965 that Major General Gordon Granger  of the United States Army came to the island of Galveston, Texas. He was take command of the Union troops there to enforce the emancipation of the slaves there. It was then that an order declaring that all slaves were free in accordance with the Emancipation Proclamation was read. This effectively ended slavery in the South, although it would continue in the Border States of  Delaware and Kentucky until the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified on December 9 1965.It was then a year later, on June 19 1866 that the first Juneteenth celebration was held. That day the formerly enslaved people of Galveston gathered to celebrate \"Jubilee Day.\" Juneteenth celebrations would spread from Gavelston to other parts of Texas. As the name, \"Juneteenth,\" it dates back to the 1890s.The holiday was officially recognized by the State of Texas in 1938 when then Governor James Allred issued a proclamation set aside June 20 1938 for observance of Emancipation Day (June 19 fell on a Sunday that year).  The Great Migration of African Americans between 1910 and 1970 would spread the celebration to other parts of the United States. The celebration of Juneteenth would decline in the mid-20th Century, only to be revived in the late Sixties and the Seventies. It was in the late Seventies that Juneteenth was recognized by the State of Texas as an official state holiday. Since then it was recognized by other states. It became a Federal holiday with the signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act on June 17 2021.Wishing everyone a very happy Juneteenth!"},

{"title": "Eddie Muller's Noir Bar: Cocktails Inspired by the World of Film Noir", "date": "Friday, June 16, 2023", "text": "Eddie Muller's Noir Bar: Cocktails Inspired by the World of Film Noir is a rather unusual book. After all, it takes a look at 50 different classic noirs and matches them with appropriate cocktails. And while Eddie Muller's Noir Bar: Cocktails Inspired by the World of Film Noir is somewhat unique, in some ways it is surprising that a book of its sort had not been published years ago. It is no secret that drinking figures heavily in film noir. Bars, nightclubs, and seedy backrooms are tropes of the film style. And while many film noir protagonists took their liquor straight up, cocktails do appear frequently in film noir.  There is a good reason many film noir fans are also cocktail connoisseurs.Of course, Eddie Muller would be the ideal person to write a book that combines film noir with cocktails. Mr. Muller is familiar to Turner Classic Movies fans as the \"Czar of Noir\" and host of the programming block Noir Alley. He is founder and president of the Film Noir Foundation, the non-profit organization dedicated to preserving, exhibiting, and educating people about noir. He has written multiple books on film noir and other aspects of cinema, and has provided commentary on many DVDs. What many might not know about Eddie Muller is that he also trained to be a professional bartender and worked as one earlier in his life. Eddie Muller is not only an expert on film noir, but an expert when it comes to tending bar and mixing drinks as well. He definitely know both subjects well.It is because of Eddie Muller's expertise that Eddie Muller's Noir Bar: Cocktails Inspired by the World of Film Noir serves well as an introduction to both film noir and making cocktails. The first part of the book deals with stocking an at-home bar, the tools one needs to properly make cocktails and the glassware one needs as well, and the basics in making a drink. Not only do these chapters serve as a good primer for those new to the art of making cocktails, but Mr. Muller has many useful tips and suggestions for those with a bit more experience. Having read Eddie Muller's Noir Bar: Cocktails Inspired by the World of Film Noir, I now have more confidence in making cocktails than I had previously.When it comes to Eddie Muller's Noir Bar: Cocktails Inspired by the World of Film Noir, I expect most noiristas are looking forward to the pairings of classic film noirs with cocktails, and Eddie Muller does not disappoint. Among the movies covered are such classics as The Asphalt Jungle (1950), The Big Sleep (1946), Gilda (1946), Nightmare Alley (1947), and Sweet Smell of Success (1957). As to the cocktails featured in the book, they are a wide variety. Eddie Muller includes such classic cocktails as the gimlet, the mai tai, the bloody Mary, and the martini. There are also more recently developed cocktails, such as the Left Hand. Finally, Eddie Muller includes some cocktails of his own creation, such as the Crimson Kimono and Sailor Beware. In most cases Eddie Muler not only provides us with the recipes for cocktails, but also some of their backgrounds as well.  As a matter of full disclosure,  I must admit that I have not yet tried some of the cocktails featured in  Eddie Muller's Noir Bar: Cocktails Inspired by the World of Film Noir, so I cannot speak to how some of them taste. I do plan to try every single one of the cocktails I have not yet had, except for the boilermaker. I have an allergy to hops, so I cannot drink beer (and I really don't like beer's flavour anyway). Eddie Muller's Noir Bar: Cocktails Inspired by the World of Film Noir is parts a primer for making drinks, film history, cocktail history, and a recipe book for cocktails. For those who like watching their film noir with a drink on the side, it is definitely a must read."},

It was while he was still in the Army that he began doing work for what would become Marvel on a regular basis. In the Fifties he provided artwork for a wide variety of titles at Marvel, including Westerns, war comics, sci-fi comics, and romances. He also did work on the short-lived 1954 revival of Captain American. John Romita's first credited work as penciller and inker of the story \"The Bradshaw Boys\" in Western Outlaws no. 1 (February 1951). In the Fifties, while John Romita Sr. was still working freelance for what would become Marvel, he also did uncredited work for National Periodical Publications (now known as DC Comics). By 1958 he worked for National Periodical Publications exclusively. His work at DC was on such romance titles as Falling in Love, Girl's Romances, Heart Throbs, and others. It was in 1965 that John Romita Sr. began freelancing for Marvel Comics again, serving as inker on The Avengers no. 23 (December 1965). At the same time he was working in advertising at BBDO. He left BBDO when Stan Lee offered to match his advertising salary and allow him to work either at the office or at home. Mr. Romita chose Marvel, and he worked on Daredevil for a brief time, beginning with Daredevil no. 12 (January 1966). It was with Amazing Spider-Man no. 39 (August 1966) that he took over the title as artist. John Romita Sr. would ultimately work on Amazing Spider-Man until no. 95 (April 1971), returning to the title with no. 105 (February 1972) and working through no. 115 (December 1972). He would ink most of the cover art through no. 168 (May 1977). In the Seventies he also provided art for such Marvel titles s Captain America, Fantastic Four, Doctor Strange, Marvel Tales, My Love, and others. He worked on The Amazing Spider-Man newspaper comic strip from 1977 to 1980. It was in July 1973 that John Romita Sr. was promoted to art director at Marvel Comics. As art director he would help design such characters as The Punisher, Wolverine, Luke Cage, and others. John Romita Sr. also worked on the crossover between DC Comics and Marvel Comics, Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man, inking the pencils of Ross Andru.  He continued as art director at Marvel Comics into the Eighties.From the Eighties into the Naughts John Romita Sr. would provide art for The Amazing Spider-Man Annual no. 16 (1982),  The Amazing Spider-Man no. 238 (March 1983),  Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man no. 121 (December 1986), The Amazing Spider-Man no. 365 (August 1992), Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man Annual no. 13 (1993), Tales of Spider-Man no. 1 (January 1999), Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man no. 1 (January 1999),  Spidey: A Universe X Special (2001),  The Amazing Spider-Man #500 (December 2003), Captain America vol. 3, no. 50 (February 2002),  Iron Man vol. 3, no.40 (May 2001),  Daredevil vol. 2, #50 (October 2003), Daredevil vol. 2, no. 94 (February 2007),  and The Amazing Spider-Man no. 642 (November 2010). The very first issue of The Amazing Spider-Man I remember reading featured the art of John Romita Sr., and he has remained my favourite Spider-Man artist ever since. His work was obviously influenced by the war and romance genres, both of which he had worked in extensively. His art was realistic, with more attention paid to anatomy  and emotion than earlier comic book artists. At the same time there was an elegance to his art. He established the most iconic look of Spider-Man, and it was after Mr. Romita took over as the artist on The Amazing Spider-Man that the title overtook Fantastic Four as Marvel's best selling title. Few artists ever had the impact that John Romita Sr. did, and few ever will."},

{"title": "Spoutible: An Alternative to Twitter", "date": "Monday, June 12, 2023", "text": "Ever since Elon Musk took over Twitter, people have been looking for an alternative to the social media platform. One of the newest is called Spoutible. Spoutible launched in January 2023. It was founded by Christopher Bouzy. Mr. Bouzy had earlier founded Bot Sentinel in 2018. Bot Sentinel is a Twitter analytics service that tracks disinformation, inauthentic behaviour, and harassment on Twitter. As might be expected, Spoutible resembles Twitter a good deal. Like Twitter, it has a timeline to which one can make \"spouts\" (as posts are called). Like Twitter, one can post images and videos. While Twitter has \"retweets,\" whereby someone can share someone else's tweets, Spoutible has echoes, whereby one can share someone else's spouts. Spoutible even has its own private messaging, much like Twitter. While Spoutible does resemble Twitter, there are some important differences. First, Spoutible has no algorithm. While most people I know do not use the Twitter algorithm, it certainly seems as if Twitter would prefer they do. Second, Christopher Bouzy is African American, making Spoutible one of the few social media services owned by a person of colour. Indeed, it could quite possibly the only one owned by a person of colour. Third, Spoutible has a focus on protecting its users. It has rules against harassment, threats, disinformation, and spam. Indeed, Spoutible relies on the same technology as Bot Sentinel to help fight against disinformation and targeted harassment.  Fourth, one can edit spouts up to seven minutes after one makes them. If one makes a typo, then, one can edit the spout and not delete it entirely. I have been using Spoutible now for around two months and I have been enjoying it. I have not seen the sort of harassment many have experienced on Twitter, nor I have seen any of the sort of spam one sees on Twitter. I have yet to be followed by a pornbot there, nor have I seen any. And while I haven't many followers yet, I receive more interaction than I do on Mastodon or many other social media sites. Nearly every day people like and echo my spouts. When I post a link to my one of my blog posts, it seems as if people will actually go and read the post, rather than ignore it and scroll on by. One disadvantage with Spoutible is one I think may eventually be corrected with time. As of yet it does not seem like there are a lot of people on the platform. Right now I only have 41 followers, as contrasted with the 277 followers I have on Mastodon. At the moment there is not much in the way of a classic film and classic television community at Spoutible. I think there are only a few of us who spout regularly about classic movies and TV shows. Of course, this is something that I think will change with time. As Spoutible continues to grow, people will get more followers and eventually classic film and television communities will develop.Now I do have to point out that like any young social media service, Spoutible has had occasional glitches. Pages would fail to load or the timeline would fail to update. While these glitches happened from time to time when I first joined Spoutible, they have declined considerably just in the past two months. From what I have read some have complained about Spoutible's Adult Content Policy, maintaining they are much too vague. Now I don't post Adult Content myself and I have yet to actually read the policy, so I cannot say much about it myself. Spoutible is hardly the only Twitter alternative out here, as several seem to have sprung up of late. That having been said, I think that it succeeds in many ways that the others don't. Only time will tell if it takes off."},
{"title": "Popeye the Sailor: The 1960s TV Cartoons by Fred M. Grandinetti", "date": "Saturday, June 10, 2023", "text": "Popeye the Sailor was one of the first multimedia superstars. He made his debut on January 17 1929 in E. C. Segar's comic strip Thimble Theatre. Thimble Theatre was nearly ten years old when Popeye first appeared, having debuted on December 19 1919. The comic strip originally centred on a character named Ham Gravy and his girlfriend Olive Oyl. Popeye was meant to only be a character in one storyline, but he proved to be so popular that he was brought back. It wasn't very long before Popeye became the main character in Thimble Theatre. It was also not long before Popeye expanded into other media beyond the newspaper strip. In 1933 Max Fleischer licensed Popeye to appear in a series of cartoons produced for Paramount Pictures. From 1935 to 1938 he appeared in  his own radio show. Popeye would also conquer the relatively new medium of comic books, receiving his own title, published by Dell Comics, in 1948. It was only a matter of time before he conquered the medium of television as well.The theatrical shorts produced by Fleischer Studios and then Famous Studios proved to be very popular in television syndication. It was then in 1960 that King Features (the newspaper syndicate that owns Popeye) commissioned a new series of animated shorts made for television. This new series of television cartoons also proved to be phenomenally popular in television syndication, so that once more Popeye had conquered another medium. Despite their success, the Popeye the Sailor television cartoons have often been disparaged for their quality and even ignored altogether by historians. Popeye the Sailor: The 1960s TV Cartoons by Fred M. Grandinetti is an indepth look at the Popeye television cartoons. While acknowledging the poor quality of many of the cartoons,  Popeye the Sailor: The 1960s TV Cartoons makes the case that many of the television cartoons were of superior in quality, with good, although limited animation and good plotlines.Author Fred M. Grandinetti is a founding member of the Popeye Fan Club and has been writing about Popeye since 1983. He has written several books on Popeye, including Popeye: An Illustrated Cultural History, Popeye, the Collectible: Dolls, Coloring Books, Games, Toys, Comic Books, Animation, and He Am What He Am!: Jack Mercer, the Voice of Popeye, as well as numerous articles. It should then come as no surprise that Popeye the Sailor: The 1960s TV Cartoons contains a wealth of information on the Sailor Man, even beyond the television cartoons. Readers will learn about a good deal about the history of Thimble Theatre and the Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios theatrical shorts.Author Fred M.Grandenetti and dolls he hadspecially made. Popeye the Sailor: The 1960s TV Cartoons details the production of the Popeye the Sailor televisions cartoons from the very beginning, when King Features Television Productions was formed. It covers producer Al Brodax (the head of King Features' film and television department) and the multiple studios that created the television cartoons. Author Fed M. Grandnetti addresses the quality of the cartoons, detailing which studios produced the cartoons that are lesser in quality as well as which studios produced those that are superior in quality. There are chapters devoted to the success of the Popeye the Sailor television cartoons, the characters in the cartoons, the vocal talent behind the cartoons, and the merchandising associated with the cartoons. To cap everything off is an episode guide, with a summary of each of the 220 cartoons.Popeye the Sailor: The 1960s TV Cartoons features a number of photos, including advertisements from trade journals, newspaper ads, photos of the voice talent, stills from the cartoons, and more.Popeye the Sailor: The 1960s TV Cartoons contains such a wealth of information, both on the history of Popeye and the cartoons themselves, that even those of us who consider ourselves knowledgeable about the character will learn a good deal that they did not know. For those of us who grew up with the Popeye television cartoons, it will also bring back many fond memories spent in front of the television set. Fred M. Grandinetti writes with an amiable style, making the book a very easy read. Ultimately Popeye the Sailor: The 1960s TV Cartoons would be a welcome addition to the collection of any Popeye fan. Popeye the Sailor: The 1960s TV Cartoons is published by BearManor Media and is available through multiple booksellers."},
{"title": "Sheila James Kuehl: More Than Zelda Gilroy", "date": "Friday, June 9, 2023", "text": "Chances are very good that Sheila James Kuehl will always be remembered as Zelda Gilroy, the exceptionally intelligent girl who was always pursuing Dobie on the classic sitcom Dobie Gillis. While that may be the case, she had a career before being cast on Dobie Gillis and she would eventually a Juris Doctor at Harvard Law School. She would eventually become the first openly gay person to serve in the California General Assembly and later the California State Senate. She would also serve on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.Sheila Ann Kuehl was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma on February 9 1941. For her acting career she would take the stage name \"Sheila James.\" Her acting career began when she was very young. She was only eight years old when she was cast on the radio show The Penny Singleton Show, starring Penny Singleton, Gale Gordon, and Jim Backus. It was her parents who encouraged Sheila James to audition for roles in television shows. She was eventually cast as Stu Erwin's tomboy daughter Jackie on The Stu Erwin Show. She appeared in 69 episodes of the show.Sheila James also guest starred on the TV shows Four Star Playhouse, General Electric Theatre, My Little Margie, and Mayor of the Town. She had small roles in the movies After The Stu Erwin Show ended she guest starred on the shows The Loretta Young Show, Date with the Angels, The Betty White Show, The Bob Cummings Show, and How to Marry a Millionaire. Among these guest appearances her roles on The Bob Cummings Show are most significant. Future Dobie Gillis co-star (indeed, Dobie himself) Dwayne Hickman played Bob's nephew Chuck on the show. The director on the first episode on which Sheila James appeared was Rod Amateau, who served as producer on Dobie Gillis for its entire run and also directed the majority of the episodes. She was already appearing as Zelda on Dobie Gillis when she guest starred on the shows The Millionaire, National Velvet, and The New Loretta Young Show.It was also after The Stu Erwin Show ended that Sheila James began attending the University of California, Los Angeles. During the summers she would serve as a counsellor at a children's camp. It was while working as a camp counsellor that she met a fellow counsellor named Kathy and fell in love with her. Because homosexuality was not accepted at the time, they chose to keep their relationship secret. The two would continue to exchange letters once Kathy went back to college in San Diego. Unfortunately, Sheila James's sorority would discover their letters and she was expelled from the sorority. The sorority assured her that nobody would be told why she was expelled, but rumours about her sexuality seemed to be spreading. Dobie Gillis, under its original title The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, debuted on September 29 1959. The show was based on the \"Dobie Gillis\" short stories written by Max Shulman and first collected under the title The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis in 1959. Sheila James first appeared as Zelda Gilroy in what was only the third episode of the show, \"Love is Science.\" Along with Dobie and his parents, Zelda was the only character on the TV show to have originated in Max Shulman's short stories. Originally, Zelda was only meant to appear in the one episode, but the character proved to be so popular that she was made a recurring character and then a semi-regular character.The character of Zelda Gilroy proved popular enough that a pilot for her own show, Zelda, was produced. If it had been picked up it would have debuted during the 1962-1963 season. CBS was initially keen on the pilot and it did well with test audiences. Unfortunately, months passed without any word from the network. Finally, Sheila James asked producer and director Rod Amateau about the pilot and he told her that a network executive found her \"too butch.\" The quote has often been attributed to James Aubrey himself, the president of CBS.It is difficult to say if someone at CBS thinking Shelia James was \"too butch\" had an adverse effect on Sheila James's career. At the time she was still deep in the closet and it seems unlikely that anyone at the network would have discovered she was a lesbian. Regardless, in 1962 even rumours of homosexuality were enough to bring an actor's career to an end. And following the pilot for Zelda, Sheila James's career was never quite the same. After appearing throughout the third season of Dobie Gillis, she only appeared in four episodes of the show's fourth and final season. She guest starred on McHale's Navy, Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, Petticoat Junction, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, and The Donna Reed Show. Sheila James would be a regular on the single-season spinoff of McHale's Navy, Broadside. Afterwards she never again had a regular role on a TV series. She would also makes three guest appearances in a story arc on The Beverly Hillbillies.  She also guest starred on the shows The Bold Ones: The New Doctors; Marcus Welby, M.D.; Love, American Style; and Emergency!. Her last two appearances were both in projects related to Dobie Gillis. Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis? was a 1977 half-hour pilot for a sequel series to Dobie Gillis that reunited much of the cast. In 1988 she appeared in the television reunion movie Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis, which reunited many of the surviving cast members.Sheila James Kuehl eventually came out while she was attending Harvard Law School and in her second relationship with a woman. She became an associate at Richards, Watson & Gershon in Los Angeles, where she focused on municipal law, and then an associate at Bersch & Kaplowitz in Beverly Hills, where she focused on civil rights law and family law. Still later she became an adjunct law professor at the University of Southern California, and then an associate professor at Loyola Law School. She was elected to the California General Assembly in 1994 and then the California State Senate in 2000. In 2014 she was elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.Zelda Gilroy was a groundbreaking character when she appeared on Dobie Gillis. Intelligent girls were a rarity on television in the late Fifties and early Sixties. Intelligent girls who knew exactly what they wanted and went after what they wanted were practically unknown. Zelda then stood out from the many teenage girls on other shows. What is more, Sheila James played Zelda perfectly. It is impossible to think of anyone else ever playing the role. Of course, she played other roles beyond Zelda. She was memorable as UCLA sociology student Ginny Jennings on The Beverly Hillbillies. On Broadside she played a character very different from Zelda, the wisecracking, man-crazy WAVE  Selma Kowalski. It is sad that Sheila James's career slowed following Dobie Gillis, particularly given she seemed poised for stardom once cast on the show. Of course, following her acting career, Shelia James went into law and then politics, where she accomplished a good deal. As mentioned above, it seems likely that Sheila James Kuehl will always be best remembered as Zelda Gilory. Even so, she played other roles and accomplished a good deal. Retired and living in Santa Monica, it seems likely she will accomplish yet more."},
{"title": "The 80th Anniversary of the Zoot Suit Riots", "date": "Thursday, June 8, 2023", "text": "The poster for the movieZoot SuitIt was from June 3 to June 8 1943 that a series of assaults were made upon Mexican American youths, as well as some Filipinos and African Americans, wearing zoot suits by white servicemen and some civilians. These attacks would collectively become known as \"the Zoot Suit Riots,\" after the men's suit that was at the centre of it all. Given that white people wearing zoot suits were not attacked, the Zoot Suit Riots are considered to have their roots in anti-Mexican American racism.As to the zoot suit itself, it is a men's suit with a long coat featuring wide lapels and padded shoulders, and with high-waisted, wide legged trousers pegged at the ankles. The zoot suit originated in Harlem and the Black communities in Chicago and Detroit in the 1930s. It was an adaptation of the drape suit, which originated in London in the 1920s and was popularized by Edward VIII, Duke of Windsor. The zoot suit was popularized by jump blues and jazz musicians, and the legendary Cab Calloway was known for his often exaggerated zoot suits.By the late Thirties the zoot suit would be adopted by pachucos, young Mexican Americans who were influenced by jump blues, jazz, and swing music. Originating in El Paso, Texas, the pachuco subculture would spread rapidly to other parts of the United States, including Los Angeles. While the pachucos incorporated the zoot suit into their fashions, they also made the zoot suit all their own. Their zoot suits were often dark in colour (black, brown, charcoal grey, sharkskin, and so on) with pin stripes. Like many youth cultures, particularly those of people of colour, the pachucos would become stereotyped in the media and elsewhere as criminals and members of youth gangs. In turn the zoot suit would become associated with violence and crime in the media. This fuelled anti-Mexican American sentiment in Los Angeles. With the United States' entry into World War II and the rationing that came about because of it, zoot suits would come to be viewed by some white Americans as \"unpatriotic\" given the amount of cloth any one zoot suit used. Anti-Mexican American sentiment would increase after the Sleepy Lagoon case, in which  José Gallardo Díaz was found unconscious and dying near the reservoir known as \"Sleepy Lagoon\" in Commerce, California. The cause of his wounds remain a matter of question, and the autopsy at the hospital revealed he had been drinking and there was a fracture at the base of his skull. Regardless, The media framed José Gallardo Díaz's death as a murder and demanded action be taken against pachucos. The Los Angeles Police Department ultimately arrested seventeen young Mexican Americans despite having insufficient evidence. It was mounting anti-Mexican American sentiment that would lead to the Zoot Suit Riots in June 1943. It was on June 3 1943 that eleven sailors departed from a bus and began to walk down Main Street in downtown Los Angeles. They then got into an alercation with a group of young Mexican Americans. The young Mexican Americans claimed that the sailors had started at all, while the sailors claimed the Mexican Americans had jumped an assaulted them. It was the following day that 200 sailors took 20 taxi cabs to East Los Angeles. Once there they proceeded to assault young men wearing zoot suits, stripping them of their suits and then burning the suits. The following days saw further assaults on young Mexican Americans by white servicemen. The police were under orders not to arrest the rioters, but they did arrest more than 500 Mexican Americans on everything from vagrancy to rioting. To make matters worse, the media's sympathies were with the white rioters, with some framing the riots as getting rid of \"miscreants\" and \"hoodlums.\" Exceptions to this were such Black newspapers as The Chicago Defender and The Pittsburgh Courier, who were sympathetic to the Mexican American victims of the riots.  Horace R. Cayton of The Pittsburgh Courier blamed the violence on \"non-Mexican servicemen,\" even going so far as to state the white rioters envied the zoot suiters and lusted after Mexican American women.  Eventually the white rioters would not only assault Mexican Americans, by young Filipinos and African Americans as well. It would be on June 8 that Navy and Marine Corps authorities in the Los Angeles area would confine sailors and Marines to quarters and declared the City of Los Angeles off-limited to them. This ended the Zoot Suit Riots, although both the Navy and Marines maintained the servicemen had been acting in self-defence.  The Zoot Suit Riots would lead to violence against Mexican Americans and members of other minorities wearing zoot suits in Chicago; Detroit; Evansville, Indiana; New York City; Oakland; Philadelphia; and San Diego. The fallout from the Zoot Suit Riots included a formal protest from the Mexican Embassy to the State Department. Then California Governor Earl Warren established a committee, headed by Bishop Joseph McGucken, to investigate the causes of the riots.The committee determined that racism was at the root of the riots and noted the \"aggravating practice\" of the media to associate the zoot suit with crime. Both the zoot suit itself and later the Zoot Suit Riots would have an impact on popular culture. In the mid-Forties it was not unusual for zoot suits to appear in movies, everything from the Tom & Jerry cartoon \"Zoot Cat\" (1944) to the musical Stormy Weather (1942). Later, in the Three Stooges short \"Three Arabian Nuts\" (1951), Shemp is featured in a zoot suit. The debut single of The High Numbers, soon to be renamed \"The Who,\" was \"Zoot Suit.\" On the 1975 Saturday morning sitcom The Ghost Busters, the lead character Eddie Spenser (Larry Storch) wore a zoot suit. In the 1976 Sanford and Son episode \"The Escorts,\" Fred Sanford appears wearing a zoot suit.The year 1978 would see two works drawing upon the Zoot Suit Riots for inspiration. The novel Zoot-Suits Murders by Thomas Sanchez in which the Zoot Suit Riots serve as a backdrop for a murder mystery. The play Zoot Suit by Luis Valdez draws upon both the Sleepy Lagoon case and the Zoot Suit Riots. It would later be adapted for the big screen as the movie Zoot Suit (1981). While zoot suits don't appear in the episode, the Zoot Suit Riots were referenced in the 8th season episode The Waltons, \"The Medal,\" which a Chicano paratrooper who visits Walton's Mountain. The title character in the movie The Mask (1994) wore a zoot suit.  The zoot suit would make a comeback during the Swing Revival of the Nineties and as a result would appear in music videos from the era.  Indeed, in 1997 the swing and ska band Cherry Poppin' Daddies recorded the song \"Zoot Suit Riot.\" Their 1997 compilation album bore the same name.The 2018 novel Jazz Owls: A Novel of the Zoot Suit Riots was centred around the Zoot Suit Riots and was told in free verse. The 2020 graphic novel Lizard in a Zoot Suit is set in 1943 and features an anthropomorphic lizard wearing a zoot suit. Over the years there have also been many non-fiction books and documentaries on the Zoot Suit Riots.The Zoot Suit Riots are certainly one of the darkest moments in the history of Los Angeles and remain one of the worst instances of racist violence in the city, or any other city for that matter. An argument can be made that the Zoot Suit Riots and other acts of violence against Mexican Americans during World War II would lead to the Chicano Movement of the Sixties and Seventies. The Zoot Suit Riots should certainly never be forgotten."},
{"title": "A Belated 19th Anniversary Post", "date": "Wednesday, June 7, 2023", "text": "On June 4 2023 A Shroud of Thoughts turned 19 years old. I generally do a special blog post each year on its anniversary, but this year it totally slipped my mind. During the month of May I was very concerned about my health, as I felt absolutely miserable. As it turned out, my blood pressure medication was not working and, worse yet, had saddled me with side effects (headaches, body pains, et. al.) that made me feel miserable. Fortunately, my cardiologist changed my medication and now I feel much better.As to the origins of A Shroud of Thoughts, in 2004 blogs were a bit of fad. I had a lady friend who had one and it looked like it might be fun. Originally A Shroud of Thoughts was meant to be on a variety of subjects, some of them quite personal. It was not long before it evolved into the pop culture/nostalgia blog that it is today and the more personal posts fell by the wayside. As to the title, in 2004 the big trend in blog titles included words like \"thoughts,\" \"musings,\" et. al. I then took the title from a quote from Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. I have to admit that I have since regretted not choosing a title more befitting a pop culture/nostalgia blog. Unfortunately, by the time I thought about changing it, the blog already had a readership and I feared changing the title might confuse my readers. It would be a bit like the movie That Thing You Do! (1996), \"Whatever happened to The Oneders?\" \"Whatever happened to A Shroud of Thoughts?\"Next year A Shroud of Thoughts will turn 20, which astounds me. If someone told me in 2004 that I would still be writing this blog after 19 years, I would have thought they were joking. I hope to continue writing it for many more years to come.Each year I post what I think were my best posts from the past year.

{"title": "The Late Great Barry Newman", "date": "Tuesday, June 6, 2023", "text": "Barry Newman, who starred in the movie Vanishing Point (1971) and the TV series Petrocelli, died May 11 2023 at the age of 92.Barry Newman was born on November 7 1930 in Boston, Massachusetts. He graduated from Boston Latin School in 1948. He later graduated from Brandeis University. In 1952 he was drafted into the United States Army. He played saxophone and clarinet  in the 3rd Army Band. After he was discharged he attended Columbia University and received a master's degree in anthropology. One of his friends invited Mr. Newman to sit in on an acting class with Lee Strasberg. Barry Newman afterwards decided to abandon anthropology and take up acting, studying with Lee Strasberg himself. In 1957 he made his debut on Broadway in Nature's Way. The following year he appeared on Broadway in Maybe Tuesday. He made his film debut in Pretty Boy Floyd in 1960. In the Sixties he appeared on Broadway in Night Life? and What Makes Sammy Run?. He made his television debut in an episode of Way Out in 1961. In the Sixties he had a brief, recurring role on the daytime serial The Edge of Night. He guest starred on the shows The Defenders, The United States Steel Hour, Naked City, Armstrong Circle Theatre, and Get Smart. He appeared in the movies The Moving Finger (1963) and The Lawyer (1970). It was in the latter that he originated the role of Tony Petrocelli. It was in 1974 that Barry Newman reprised the role of Tony Petrocelli on the TV series Petrocelli, which was based on the movie The Lawyer. He appeared in the TV movies Night Games, Sex and the Married Woman, and King Crab. He appeared in the movies The Vanishing Point (1971), The Salzburg Connection (1972), Fear is the Key (1972), and City on Fire (1979). In the Eighties he was one of the stars of the short-lived TV series Nightingales. He guest starred on the shows Quincy, M.E. and The Fall Guy. He appeared in the mini-series Fatal Vision. He appeared in the TV movies Fantasies, ...Deadline, Second Sight: A Love Story, and My Two Loves. He appeared in the movie Amy (1981).

He appeared in the movies Jack the Dog (2001), Good Advice (2001), True Blue (2001), 40 Days and 40 Nights (2002), Manhood (2003) and Grilled (2006). In the Teens he appeared in the film Raise Your Kids on Seltzer (2015).Barry Newman was a very talented actor, something borne out by the fact that his two best known roles were very different. Kowalksi in The Vanishing Point was a reserved Vietnam vet and former police officer who is intent on delivering a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T 440 Magnum as quickly as possible. Petrocelli was a Harvard educated lawyer who champions those innocent of the crimes of which they are accused. The one thing both characters had in common was that they liked to drive really fast. While both roles were very different, Barry Newman gave remarkable performances in both roles. On Miss Marple, in an adaptation of The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, he played film producer Jason Rudd. In Fear is the Key, he played the protagonist John Talbot, a man accused of robbing a bank and killing a police officer who finds himself involved in intrigue. Barry Newman played a variety of roles throughout his career, from lawyers to doctors to yet other occupations, and he did all of them well."},
{"title": "Godspeed Ed Ames", "date": "Saturday, June 3, 2023", "text": "Singer and actor Ed Ames died on May 21 2023 at the age of 95. Both with the Ames Brothers and as a solo artist, he had several hits. As an actor he may be best known for playing Mingo on Daniel Boone.Ed Ames was born Edmund Dantes Urick on July 9 1927 in Maldon, Massachusetts. He attended the Boston Latin School. He studied both classical music and opera. His brothers formed a singing quartet while still in high school. Three of the brothers would later form the Amory Brothers. It was playwright Abe Burrows who suggested a new name, \"the Ames Brothers.\" The Ames Brothers signed with Coral Records and their first single, \"Caravan,\" was released in 1947. In 1948 they would have their first hit, \"A Tree in the Meadow\" recorded with Monica Lewis. It went to no. 21 on the Billboard chart. The year 1950 gave them their first no. 1 hit, \"Rag Mop.\" It was followed by another no. 1 hit, \"Sentimental Me.\" Throughout the Fifties the Ames Brothers would have a string of hits, including \"Can Anyone Explain? (No, No, No), \"Undecided,\" \"You, You, You,\" \"The Man with a Banjo,\" \"The Naughty Lady of Shady Lane,\" and \"Tammy.\"In 1949 they were regulars on Robert Q. Lewis's radio show. That same year they were regulars on the CBS musical quiz radio show Sing It Again. In 1955 they had a syndicated television show, The Ames Brothers Show.  The Ames Brothers disbanded in 1963, whereupon Ed Ames launched a solo career. He had several hits in the Sixties, including \"My Cup Runneth Over,\" \"Time, Time,\" \"Timeless Love,\" \"When the Show is on the Roses,\" and \"Who Will Answer?.\" Ed Ames began his acting career in 1957 on the show State Trooper. He appeared with the other Ames Brothers on an episode of Mike Hammer in 1958. Prior to Daniel Boone, he guest starred on The Rifleman, Redigo, and The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters. It was in 1964 that he began playing Mingo, the Oxford educated Cherokee, on Daniel Boone. He left the show after is fourth season. Afterwards he guest starred on The Danny Thomas Hour and provided a voice for the Rankin/Bass special Cricket on the Hearth. In the Seventies he guest starred on The Starlost McCloud, Kodiak, The Wide World of Mystery, and Greatest Heroes of the Bible. In the Eighties he guest starred on Murder, She Wrote; It's Gary Shandling's Show, In the Heat of the Night; and Jake and the Fatman. In the Nineties he made his last television appearance, a guest shot on The Marshal. Ed Ames was very talented as a singer. He had a rich, very expressive baritone. It is a little wonder that both as one of the Ames Brothers and as a solo act he had a string of hit songs. He was also very talented actor. While it was admitted politically incorrect for Mr. Ames to play Mingo and while the portrayal of the Cherokee on Daniel Boone was inaccurate, he did well in the role. He would also do well in other roles as well. He played a racist, corrupt sheriff on an episode of In the Heat of the Night. In the McCloud episode \"The Colorado Cattle Caper\" he played the leader of a gang of cattle rustlers. In the Murder, She Wrote he played a role with which he was familiar, that of a singer, although in this instance it was a somewhat amoral singer. On The Rifleman he played a man wanted to murder. Both as a singer and an actor Ed Ames was enormously talented and very versatile."},

He played the role of John Gary. a former serviceman who sets out to travel the country with fellow veteran Lincoln Ridgeway (Robert Morris). There would be several changes made before the pilot would lead to Route 66. The two leads were renamed Tod Stiles and Buz Murdock, with Martin Milner cast in the role of Tod. They were no longer ex-serviceman. Tod was a Yale dropout from a once wealthy family, while Buz was an orphan who grew up on the streets of New York City.

He was nominated for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Series (Lead) for his role as Buz Murdock in 1962. He left the show during its third season after he had contracted hepatitis. After taking a break to recover from the disease, he appeared in the movies Quick, Before It Metls (1964), Sylvia (1965), The Satan Bug (1965), A Covenant with Death (1967), The Happening (1967), Land Raiders (1969), The Desperadoes (1969), and El último día de la guerra (1970). He also continued to appear on television, guest starring on the shows, Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, The Danny Thomas Hour, Journey to the Unknown, and Love Story. He starred in the short-lived show The Most Dangerous Game from 1970-1971. In the Seventies George Maharis guest starred on the shows Night Gallery, Cade's County, Medical Center, Cannon, Mission: Impossible, Barnaby Jones, Shaft, Marcus Welby M.D., The Snoop Sisters, Thriller, The Wide World of Mystery, McMillan & Wife, Movin' On, Nakia, Ellery Queen, Good Heavens, Jigsaw John, Bert D'Angelo/Superstar, The Bionic Woman, Kojak, Police Story, The Feather and Father Gang, Switch, Gibbsville, Logan's Run, and Fantasy Island. He appeared in the mini-series Rich Man, Poor Man. In the Eighties he appeared in the movie The Sword and the Sorcerer (1982). He guest starred on Fantasy Island; Matt Houston; The Master; Superboy; and Murder, She Wrote. His last appearance on screen was in the movie Doppelganger in 1993. George Maharis also had a recording career. Starting with George Maharis Sings!, he recorded seven albums from 1962 to 1966. He released several singles from 1962 to 1965, but only his cover of \"Teach Me Tonight\" was a hit. It went to no. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1962.George Maharis was a very talented actor. Both Buz Murdock and Tod Stiles on Route 66 rank among the greatest television characters of all time, all because of the performances of George Maharis and Martin Milner. He was also versatile. In The Satan Bug he played Lee Barrett, an outspoken private investigator who had earlier worked as an intelligence agent. In The Sword and the Sorcerer, he actually played a villain, Count Machelli, the War Chancellor to the evil Titus Cromwell (Richard Lynch). In the Ellery Queen episode \"The Adventure of the Judas Tree,\" he played the family physician, Dr. Anthony Bender, of millionaire George Sherman. In The Desperadoes he played one of a band of raiders led by corrupt  Parson Josiah Galt (Jack Palance). George Maharis could play nearly any role he wanted, and he always gave performances. Such was his talent that he could convey emotion with just a look or his body language. While he will always be best remembered as Buz Murdock, he left behind many other great performances."},

{"title": "Two Unusual Homes on Late Fifties Sitcoms", "date": "Friday, May 12, 2023", "text": "The late Fifties was the era of domestic sitcoms like The Donna Reed Show and Leave It to Beaver. The families on these shows generally lived in suburban homes that were almost always two storeys. There were at least two exceptions during this era. One centred on a group of hillbillies who migrated from the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia to a farm in the San Fernando Valley. The other centred on the teenage son of a small town grocer.The Real McCoys debuted on October 3 19457 on ABC and centred on the family of the title, who inherited a farm in the San Fernando Valley from an uncle. This alone made it different from the many sitcoms set in the suburbs of the time. Further setting them apart was the fact that their house was only a single storey. In the pilot a house on the Iverson Ranch was used. It had appeared in movies from Outlaws of Boulder Pass (1942) to Don't Knock the Rock (1956). For the regular series a house resembling the one on the Iverson Ranch was built on the old RKO Forty Acres lot, that had recently been bought by Desilu. Such classic films as King Kong (1933) and Gone with the Wind (1939) had been filmed there. The first season of The Adventures of Superman and later The Andy Griffith Show and Batman would be filmed there.As might be expected, the living room on The Real McCoys looked a bit old fashioned, with furniture that probably went back to the Victorian era. The same was true of the bedrooms, down to their wrought iron beds To a lesser degree, the same could be said of its kitchen/dining room. The McCoy's home offered a sharp contrast to the many Mid-Century Modern suburban homes featured on other sitcoms.While the McCoys lived in the country, the Gillis family on Dobie Gillis lived in the fictional town of Central City. Dobie Gillis centred on the girl-crazy teenager of the title (Dwayne Hickman), who was the son of the owner of a neighbourhood grocery store (Frank Faylen). As was typical of such neighbourhood groceries, the Gillis family lived above the store. This already sets it apart from many domestic sitcoms of the era. Of course, being located above a grocery, the Gillis home was also located in a downtown district rather than a residential area. In establishing shots of the downtown, other businesses are visible, including King Drug Store (a Rexall Pharmacy) and the State Hotel. From various episodes it would appear that Charlie Wong's ice cream parlour, Riff Ryan's Music Store, the Bijou Theatre, and Ziegler's clothing store are all within walking distance of the grocery. Even further setting it apart is that very little of the action on the show actually takes place in the Gillis home. It usually takes place in the grocery or at Central City High (later S. Peter Pryor Junior College), with some scenes at the local ice cream parlour on occasion. When scenes do take place in the Gillis home, it is often in the dining room/kitchen or Dobie's bedroom. The Gillis home is set apart from the various domestic sitcoms in that its dining room and kitchen are combined, but other than that the dining room/kitchen is similar to what one might see on other sitcoms of the time, complete with a toaster and a refrigerator (albeit a small one). Dobie's bedroom is also what one would expect from a teenager living in the late Fifties. Pictures and sports pennants decorate the wall, and a lamp sets on a night stand by the bed. There is apparently a tree outside the bedroom window, which explains how Dobie's pal Maynard (Bob Denver) is able to enter the room by way of the window (Dobie's room is on the second storey, above the grocery store). The Glllis family does have a living room, although its appearance could vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it has a table for dining when they have guests, sometimes it doesn't. When the table does appear, its position in the living room may vary. What is consistent about the Gillis living room is that it has a couch, several cabinets filled with knick knacks, and armchairs. Like many old-time, downtown stores, the Gillis Grocery also had a basement, as seen in first season episode \"The Chicken from Outer Space.\" In the end, the Gillis home is a sharp contrast to the homes seen on such shows as The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet and The Donna Reed Show.Of course, both The Real McCoys and Dobie Gillis differed from other shows of the late Fifties in other ways. The Real McCoys was the first of the rural sitcoms, which set it apart from the sitcoms set in the suburbs. Although it debuted in 1959, Dobie Gillis had much more in common with such sitcoms of the Sixties as Bewitched and The Monkees than it did Father Knows Best and Leave It to Beaver. I will say that of the two homes I prefer the Gillis home to the McCoys' home. I grew up on a farm and we had a better house than the McCoys, complete with Mid-Century Modern furnishings. Besides, I think it would have been fun living above a grocery store. Think about it. One would never have to go far to get groceries!"},
{"title": "The Late Great Newton Minow", "date": "Wednesday, May 10, 2023", "text": "Newton Minow, who served as the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (BCC) under President John F. Kennedy, died on May 6 2023 at the age of 97. He remains well-known for his speech before the National Association of Broadcasters on May 9 1961. Officially titled, \"Television and the Public Interest,\" it would become known as \"the Vast Wasteland\" speech.Newton Minow was born on January 7 1926 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. During World War II he served in the United States Army. Following the war he received a Bachelor of Science degree from Northwestern University and then a Juris Doctor from  Northwestern University School of Law. He went to work for the law firm of  Mayer, Brown & Platt and then became a law clerk to Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson of the U.S. Supreme Court. He became an assistant counsel to Adlai Stevenson, Governor of Illinois, and was afterwards a partner in  law firm of Stevenson, Rifkind & Wirtz. It was in 1961 that President John F. Kennedy appointed Newton Minow as the Chairman of the FCC. Newton Minow would have an enormous impact as the Chairman of the FCC. He supported passage of the All-Channel Receiver Act of 1962, which required all television manufacturers to include a UHF tuner on their sets. This made UHF television stations more viable. He was also influential with regards to satellite communications. He pushed through the licence for a test of Telstar that occurred in July 1962.He also campaigned for Congress to pass legislation related to communications satellites. While these achievements are arguably greater that the \"Vast Wasteland\" speech, Mr. Minow remains best known for that speech. Although the speech is remembered for the phrase \"vast wasteland,\" it was not a condemnation of all television programming. Instead he was reminding broadcasters that they must serve the public interest and as a result they must do better. Indeed,  he cited a number of television shows he considered to be of quality, including Kraft Theatre and The Twilight Zone.After serving as the Chairman of the FCC, Newton Minow would do further work in communications. He sat on the Board of Governors of National Educational Television and its successor the Public Broadcasting Service. From 1978 to 1980 he was Chairman of PBS. He also served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnegie Corporation, a foundation founded by Andrew Carnegie \"to promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding\" and one of PBS's chief sponsors.Newton Minow later worked as senior counsel at Sidney Austin LLP. Later he served as Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Singapore. Newton Minow also wrote books, including Inside the Presidential Debates: Their Improbable Past and Promising Future, and Abandoned in the Wasteland: Children, Television, and the First Amendment.Newton Minow would have an enormous impact, both as FCC Chairman and as a private individual. He was important in the passage of the All Receivers Act, which required all television sets to have UHF receivers. The requirement that all TV sets have UHF tuners would allow ABC to expand until it was finally competitive with NBC and CBS. It would also allow for the proliferation of independent television stations and public television stations. His support of thee Communications Satellite Act of 1962 and INTELSAT helped pave the way for communications satellites. As to his speech \"Television and the Public Interest,\" it would lead to the networks airing more news coverage and educational content throughout the Sixties and Seventies. Newton Minow also supported public television. In the end Newton Minow may have had more impact than any other FCC Chairman. Indeed, he may have had more impact on television and communications than most of those who actually in the industry."},
{"title": "Guy Lee, One of the Actors Who Played Charlie Wong on Dobie Gillis", "date": "Saturday, May 6, 2023", "text": "Guy Lee, Dwayne Hickman,and Shelia James from Dobie Gillis  Guy Lee is not among the best known Asian American actors, but he is remembered by many for playing ice cream parlour owner Charlie Wong on the classic sitcom The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. Guy Lee more or less shared the role with fellow actor James Yagi, and it was not unusual for Guy Lee play Charlie in one episode and then James Yagi to appear as Charlie in the next. Guy Lee was the first of the two play the part, in the episode \"Maynard's Farewell to Arms.\" In the next episode in which Charlie appeared, \"The Old Goat,\" it was James Yagi who played the role. Guy Lee ultimately played Charlie the most, appearing in five episodes. He last appeared in \"A Taste for Lobster,\" episode 38 of the first season. As to James Yagi, he appeared in four episodes as Charlie Wong, last appearing in \"The Flying Millicans,\" episode 18 of the first season. Charlie Wong no longer appeared on the show after the first season.Aside from The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, Guy Lee made two guest appearances on Bonanza (playing a different role each time), and also guest starred on episodes of Richard Diamond, Private Detective; Death Valley Days; Honey West; Ironside; and others. He also appeared in such movies as Girls! Girls! Girls! (1962) and One More Train to Rob (1971). Guy Lee's biggest impact may have been as an agent who represented such Asian American actors as B. D. Wong and John Lone, as well as an activist. He took over The Bessie Loo Talent Agency, which represented Asian American actors, from Bessie Loo, who had been an actress, when she retired. Guy Lee & Associates was still in operation as of 2019. Guy Lee was a co-founder and board member of the Association of Asian Pacific American Artists, which was founded in 1976 to right stereotyping and promote a more realistic portrayal of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in movies and television. He was among the many Asian Americans who protested the casting of British actor Jonathan Pryce as the engineer in the Broadway production of Miss Saigon rather than an Asian  actor.Guy Lee died on November 22 1993 at the age of 66 from cancer. While it is likely he will always be best remembered as Charlie Wong on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, he did so much more."},
{"title": "The Late Great Gordon Lightfoot", "date": "Friday, May 5, 2023", "text": "Gordon Lightfoot, the legendary singer/songwriter who had such hits as \"If You Could Read My Mind,\" \"Sundown,\" and \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" died on May 1 2023 at the age of 84. Gordon Lightfoot was born on November 7 1938 in Orillia, Ontario. His mother encouraged his musical talent and he started performing while still young. He sang in the choir of St. Paul's United Church in Orillia and he performed from time to time on local radio in Orillia. When he was twelve years old he appeared at Massey Hall in Toronto for the first time. In high school he was competed in track-and-field, and even set school records for for shot-put and pole vault. He studied music at the University of Toronto. He was twenty years old when he moved to Los Angeles and studied jazz composition at the Westlake College of Music in Hollywood. After two years Gordon Lightfoot returned to Toronto. He performed on the CBC television program Country Hoedown as part of the  Singin' Swingin' Eight. He also performed as the various coffee houses around Toronto, both as a soloist and as a part of folk ensembles. His first single, \"(Remember Me) I'm the One,\" was released in 1962. It went to no. 3 on the Canadian singles chart. It was followed by \"It's Too Late, He Wins\" and \"Adios, Adios\" that same year. In 1963 he moved to the United Kingdom where he hosted the BBC's  Country and Western Show. He returned to Canada in 1964. His first album, Lightfoot!, was released in 1966. In 1967 he was commissioned by the CBC to write the \"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\" for the television special One Hundred Years Young, celebrating Canada's centennial. He also performed the song in the special. In 1970 he appeared on the CBC's The Wayne & Shuster Comedy Special.It was also in 1970 that he signed with Warner Bros./Reprise. This would result in Gordon Lightfoot's first hit in the United States. His single \"If You Could Read My Mind\" went to no. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and no. 1 on the Canadian singles chart. That same year his album Sit Down Young Stranger (from which \"If You Could Read My Mind' was from) went to no. 12 on both the Billboard album chart and the Canadian album chart.The Seventies would see Gordon Lightfoot release several successful albums. He would also have some of his biggest hits during the decade. His song \"Sundown\" went to no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1974. That same year \"Carefree Highway\" went to no. 10 on the chart. The following year \"Rainy Day People\" reached 26 on the Billboard Hot 100. The year 1976 produced his second biggest hit, \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" which peaked at no. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Seventies marked the peak of Gordon Lightfoot's popular success, but he recorded seven more albums from 1982 to 2020. He also continued to perform and appear on television. Mr. Lightfoot wold also have two acting roles. He appeared in Western Harry Tracy, Desperado (1982) and a 1988 episode of the TV series Hotel. Gordon Lightfoot was an incredible talent. He was gifted with a rich baritone with which he could convey any emotion. More importantly, he was an incredible songwriter. Mr. Lightfoot told stories with his songs. \"If You Could Read My Mind\" addressed the failure of a romantic relationship. With \"Don Quixote\" he dealt with the famous character from Cervantes's novel. \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" told the story of the sinking of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior on November 10 1975. Gordon Lightfoot was a skilled lyricist who told compelling stories capable of moving his listeners."},
{"title": "The 30th Anniversary of Blood In Blood Out (1993)", "date": "Sunday, April 30, 2023", "text": "It was on this date in 1993 that Blood In Blood Out, under the title Bound by Honor, was released nationally.  Walt Disney Studios, which released the film under their production label Hollywood Pictures, offered the film little in the way of support. Critics gave the movie mixed reviews. The film ultimately did poorly at the box office. Despite this, Blood In Blood Out would go onto become a cult film, particularly among Chicanos and especially in Los Angeles County.For those who have never seen Blood In Blood Out, it centres on three related Chicanos as they navigate their lives from 1972 to 1984. While all three begin as part of an East Los Angeles street gang, their lives ultimately take very different paths. The origins of Blood In Blood Out (1993) go back to 1982. Producer Jerry Gershwin, who had produced Harper (1966) and Where Eagles Dare (1968), hired novelist Ross Thomas to write the screenplay. It went into development at New Visions Pictures under director Harold Becker, who had directed such films as The Ragman's Daughter (1972), The Onion Field (1979), and Taps (1981).  The August 7 1988 issue of The Los Angeles Times reported that Blood In Blood Out would mark the directorial debut of Edward James Olmos, and that Andy Garcia and Lou Diamond Phillips were set to star in the film. Ultimately, Edward James Olmos, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Andy Garcia would not be a part of Blood In Blood Out. In the meantime New Vision Pictures folded, after which Edward James Olmos took the project to Taylor Hackford. Taylor Hackford had directed the film An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) and both produced and directed the films Against All Odds (1984) and White Nights (1985). Taylor Hackford had been a producer on La Bamba (1987), the biopic about Chicano rock 'n' roll legend Ritchie Valens.  While Mr. Hackford liked the format of Blood In Blood Out, he thought the text of the screenplay did not ring true. He had grown up in Santa Barbara, California around the Mexican American community there, and as a reporter for KCET had covered East Los Angeles with his fellow reporter Jesus Treviño.Ultimately, Edward James Olmos and Taylor Hackford would part ways, with Olmos citing creative differences. He would go onto produce and direct American Me (1992), a film about similar subject matter. It was then that Taylor Hackford decided he would direct Blood In Blood Out himself. As to the screenplay, it would be rewritten by Floyd Mutux, who also contributed to American Me (1992). Jeremy Iacone would also rewrote the script. It was famous playwright Luis Valdez, best known for the play Zoot Suit, who directed Taylor Hackford to poet Jimmy Santiago Baca. At the time Jimmy Santiago Baca was not particularly interested in working in the film industry. It took Taylor Hackford visiting the poet in New Orleans to convince him to work on Blood In Blood Out. Jimmy Santiago Baca then moved from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Los Angeles to absorb the Chicano culture of East Los Angeles. Jimmy Santiago Baca also drew upon his own life experiences in working on the screenplay (he had spent five years in prison for drug possession), with characters based on the sorts of people he had known in prison. Taylor Hackford has said that Jimmy Santiago Baca came up with most of the final plot of Blood In Blood Out.Blood In Blood Out attracted the attention of Ricardo Mestres, president of production for Hollywood Pictures. Hollywood Pictures had been founded by then Disney CEO Michael Eisner and then Disney studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, and was meant to release movies with more mature themes than those released by Disney and Touchstone Pictures. Michael Eisner had been at Paramount when Taylor Hackford had directed An Officer and a Gentleman for that studio. It was then that Disney, then as now best known for family films came to produce Blood In Blood Out.The first of the three leads to be cast was Jesse Borrego, who played artist Cruz Candelara in the movie. At the time he may have been best known as Jesse Velasquez on the TV show Fame. Benjamin Bratt was the second lead to be cast. He played Paco Aguilar in the film, who eventually joins the LAPD. Benjamin Bratt had appeared in two short lived shows, Knightwatch and Nasty Boys. The last of the leads to be cast was Damian Chapa, who played the all important role of Miklo Velka, around whom much of the movie revolves. Like Miklo, Damian Chapa was the child of mixed heritage: he was the son of a Mexican father and an Irish mother. None of the three leads were from Los Angeles, so to insure authenticity director Taylor Hackford had them move into a house near Hazard Park so they could immerse themselves in the culture of the area. Each night Jesse Borrego would go over the script with Benjamin Bratt and Damian Chapa in what were referred to as \"Vatos Locos Tutorials,\" in which they went over the particulars of Chicano jargon.Beyond the three leads, Blood In Blood Out featured several cast members who would soon be famous. It was an early credit for Billy Bob Thornton, who may have been best known as Billy Bob Davis on the sitcom Hearts Afire when the movie came out. It was also an early credit for Danny Trejo, who had actually served time in San Quentin State Prison. Ving Rhames had already appeared in such movies as Native Son (1989) and  Jacob's Ladder (1990). The year following the release of Blood In Blood Out (1993), he appeared in Pulp Fiction (1994). The cast also included Latino actors who were already well established. Enrique Castillo, who played gang leader Montana, was a founding member of The Latino Theater Company and had guest starred on such shows as The Waltons and The Incredible Hulk. Lupe Ontiveros was already a legend in Latino film, with a career going back to the Seventies. Also among the cast was my dear friend Vanessa Marquez, who had already appeared in the classic Stand and Deliver (1988) and in unaired episodes of the TV show Wiseguy. The paintings by Jesse Borrego's character Cruz Candelara in Blood In Blood Out were by Chicano artist Adan Hernandez. A native of San Antonio, his art would be displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the San Antonio Museum Art. Blood In Blood Out (1993) was filmed from May 6 1991 to October 4 1991. Perhaps the most famous shooting location in the film is San Quentin State Prison. Director Taylor Hackford got a copy of the script to then warden Dan Vasquez, who was impressed by its authenticity. He then gave permission for Blood In Blood Out to be filmed in the prison. Several of San Quentin's inmates at the time served as extras in the film. Even warden Dan Vasquez appeared as the warden in the movie.Blood In Blood Out was also filmed at several locations in Los Angeles and East Los Angeles. Among the best known of these is the southwest corner of Folsom Street and N. Indiana Street in East Los Angeles, where the bunya pine known as El Pino is located. The tree appears extensively in the film. Another famous location in the film is the restaurant Los 5 Puntos, located at what was then Brooklyn Avenue and is now East Chavez Avenue. Other locations included St. Mary's Catholic Church on Chicago Street in Los Angeles and Evergreen Cemetery on North Evergreen Avenue in Los Angeles.The original cut of Blood In Blood Out turned out to be over five hours long. Much too long for theatrical release, the film was then edited down to three hours. The five hour version has never been released and it cannot definitively be said that it even still exists. It was as Blood In Blood Out was being edited that riots erupted in Los Angeles in the late April and early May of 1992 following the acquittal of the police officers who had beaten Rodney King. Michael Eisner, CEO of Disney, grew concerned that following the riots, the release of Blood In Blood Out could then generate bad press for the studio. Because of this, the film's release was delayed. On February 5 1993, test screenings were held in Rochester, New York, Tucson, Arizona, and Las Vegas, Nevada. It was at a screening in Las Vegas that a fist fight broke out during the film in which no one was injured. According to director Taylor Hackford recalled, the incident was enough to convince Michael Eisner that the film would result in violence. It was Frank Wells, then president of The Walt Disney Company, who would see to it that Blood In Blood Out would be released, although under a new title. After years of being known as Blood In Blood Out, the movie was retitled Bound by Honor. As  result, the studio's entire marketing campaign for the film had to be redone, from the trailers to the posters.It was then on April 30 1993 that Bound by Honor was released in thirty cities across the nation. Before the test screenings in Rochester, Tucson, and Las Vegas, when it was still known as Blood In Blood Out, Disney projected the movie to make $40 million. Instead as Bound by Honor, only made a meagre $4.5 million. Bound by Honor was not well received by critics either. Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times gave it a negative review, ending his review with \"Apparently in love with East L.A., this film succeeds only in getting lost in it.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum in The Chicago Reader also gave Bound by Honor a negative review, writing that it was an \"....ugly three-hour snoozefest is apparently supposed to do for East Los Angeles Chicanos what the Godfather movies did for New York mafiosi…\" Roger Ebert's review of Bound by Honor was decidedly mixed. He wrote, \"Bound by Honor contains some effective performances, some moments of deeply felt truth, and a portrait of prison life that I assume is accurate. What seems to be missing is a clear idea of why the movie was made, and what the director, Taylor Hackford, wanted to say with it.\" As might be expected, many reviews compared it to the previous year's American Me (1992).For its release on home video, the original title of Blood In Blood Out was restored. It was also released under the title Blood In Blood Out...Bound by Honor to such premium cable channels as Showtime and The Movie Channel. Slowly but surely, Blood In Blood Out developed a following. Eventually it became a cult film. A slightly longer \"director's cut\" would be released on DVD, although the five hour version remains unavailable.Here I want to digress for a moment to discuss Vanessa Marquez in Blood Out Blood Out given it remains one of her best known movies. Vanessa played the daughter of Montana, the leader of the gang La Onda in the film. Earlier in the movies pictures of Vanessa when she was younger can be seen in Montana's cell. Later in the film she appears briefly when Montana's daughter is going to visit him. She is only on for a minute and then she really has nothing in the way of lines. It may be possible that Vanessa received more screen time in the five hour version. I have never been able to confirm it, but I have seen claims (including on IMDB) that one of the subplots involved a grown up Montana's daughter. If this is the case, Vanessa Marquez may have originally had much more screen time in the film. I cannot say for certain, as Vanessa and I never discussed Blood In Blood Out.First conceived in 1982, Blood In Blood Out took many years to reach the screen. Once it did, it was all but abandoned by the studio that had released it. Regardless, through its release on VHS and being shown on various premium cable channels, Blood In Blood Out developed a following. Today it is a cult classic, particularly in the Chicano community. It is safe to say that it will be remembered for years to come."},
{"title": "Death Race 2000 (1975)", "date": "Friday, April 28, 2023", "text": "(This post is part of the Futurethon hosted by Cinematic Catharsis and Realweedgiemidget Reviews)If there was ever a Golden Age for dystopian science fiction movies, it might well have been the Seventies. The decade saw the release of such films as A Clockwork Orange (1971), Silent Running (1972), Soylent Green (1973), and Rollerball (1975).  Among the best known dystopian science fiction movies from the Seventies was Death Race 2000 (1975). What sets it apart from other dystopian sci-fi movies of the decade is that it actually has a sense of humour.Death Race 2000 is set in the year of its title. Following the World Crash of '79, during which there was widespread economic and civil unrest, the United States has become a fascist dictatorship. To keep the population complacent, the government offers up its own version of \"bread and circuses,\" the Transcontinental Road Race. During the Transcontinental Road Race, racers cross the country, racking up bonus points for every person they kill along the way. As might be expected, the race is the year 2000 is complicated by a plot by a resistance group intent on disrupting the event. As to Frankenstein (David Carradine), the race's reigning champion, he has his own agenda.In part, Death Race 2000 owes its existence to the novel Damnation Alley by Roger Zelazny. Producer Roger Corman had wanted to adapt Damnation Alley as a movie, but 20th Century Fox held its film rights (the studio would eventually release their adaptation of the novel in 1977). Unable to produce a film based on Damnation Alley, Roger Corman then optioned the film rights to the short story \"The Racer\" by Ib Melchior. Published in 1956 in the men's magazine Escapade, the story was about a race during which  racers earn points for the number of pedestrians they kill. It was at this time that United Artists had announced Rollerball, a big budget, dystopian science fiction movie that also featured a violent, futuristic sport. Roger Corman figured that with Death Race 2000 he could capitalize on the publicity building up to the release of Rollerball.The first script for Death Race 2000 was written by Robert Thom, who had written such films as All the Fine Young Cannibals (1960) and Wild in the Streets (1968). Director Paul Bartel thought Robert Thom's script could not possibly be filmed, and then wrote his own draft of the screenplay. This was in turn rewritten by Charles B. Griffith, who had written Not of This Earth (1956), Little Shop of Horrors (1960), and The Wild Angels (1966). The lead role of Frankenstein was ultimately filled by David Carradine,then best known for the TV series Kung Fu. Paul Bartel had seen him in the play The Royal Hunt of the Sun and was suitably impressed. In addition to David Carradine, Death Race 2000 also featured cast members who would shortly become famous. Sylvester Stallone played Frankenstein's chief rival, the Chicago style gangster Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, only a little over two years before the release of Rocky (1976). Martin Kove, who would later play John Kreese, the antagonist in the Karate Kid movies, played the Roman-themed racer Nero the Hero. Of course, among the biggest stars of Death Race 2000 are the cars themselves. They were designed by James Powers and constructed by Dean Jeffries (who had also been responsible for Black Beauty on The Green Hornet and the Monkeemobile on The Monkees). The cars were constructed using Volkswagen chassis. Unfortunately, none of them could go over 40 miles per hour. The cars were then shot undercranked in long shots to give the illusion of speed.Director Paul Bartel and producer Roger Corman would come to a disagreement during the shooting of Death Race 2000. Paul Bartel felt that the concept of the movie was inherently violent, so there need be little blood shown on the screen. At the same time, Paul Bartel insisted on humour in the film. Roger Corman thought the audience would want violence in the film. Once Paul Bartel had finished filming Death Race 2000, he sent out a second unit to shoot scenes involving blood that could be inserted into the film. As it turned out, most of the blood inserts could not be used, as the MPAA threatened to rate Death Race 2000 \"X.\" Afterwards the MPAA gave it an \"R\" rating, some of the blood inserts were put back into the film.Death Race 2000 ultimately cost $480,000. It made a respectable profit, earning $4.8 million in the Untied States alone. The film received decidedly mixed review from critics. Roger Ebert's review was largely negative and he was surprised by the presence of children in the theatre, stating \"... I was torn between walking out immediately and staying to witness a spectacle more dismaying than anything on the screen: the way small children were digging the gratuitous bloodshed.\" In The New York Times, Lawrence Van Gelder wrote that Death Race 2000 has  \"....nothing to say beyond the superficial about government or rebellion. And in the absence of such a statement, it becomes what it seems to have mocked—a spectacle glorifying the car as an instrument of violence.\" On the other hand, Tom Shales of The Washington Post and Kevin Thomas of The Los Angeles Times were more positive with regards to Death Race 2000. Tom Shales called it, \"..one of the zippier little B pictures of the year,\" while Kevin Thomas called it, \"a fine little action picture with big idea.\"Much of the reason Death Race 2000 may have received mixed reviews upon its initial release is that the film was in some ways something of an anachronism. While Roger Corman cut much of Paul Bartel's humour from the film, it plays like such works of Sixties camp as the 1960s TV show Batman and the movie Barbarella, but with ultraviolence thrown in to boot. The racers are all colourful characters with cars that match their respective personalities. As mentioned above, Sylvester Stallone plays Machine Gun Joe, a racer who acts and looks like a 1920s Chicago gangster, while Martin Kove's Nero the Hero has an ancient Roman theme, right down to his helmet. The other racers are the Western themed \"Calamity Jane\" Kelly (Mary Woronov) and the neo-Nazi  Matilda \"The Hun\" (Roberta Collins). Not only are the racers over the top, but so too are the numerous deaths throughout the film. While Roger Corman simply wanted an ultraviolent science fiction action movie, Paul Bartel delivered what is at times a cartoonish comedy.Of course, in addition to being intentionally camp, Death Race 2000 also works as satire. It portrays the media as exploitative, covering every death during the Transcontinental Road Race in detail. The government in Death Race 2000 has gone so insane as to believe its own propaganda, and has no concern for the safety of its citizens. Only the Resistance is treated with some respect in the film. Sadly, in some ways Death Race 2000 seems a bit prescient, given the popularity of reality shows and, even more so, the media's habit of airing bodycam videos of people's deaths.While Death Race 2000 received mixed reviews upon its release, it has since become a cult film. In 1995 a series of comic books serving as a sequel to the film, Death Race 2020, was published. In 2008 a poorly received remake, Death Race, was released. It was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. In 2017 there was an official sequel to the film, produced by Roger Corman and released direct to video, Death Race 2050. This sequel was somewhat better received than the 2008 remake.While Death Race 2000 received mixed reviews upon its initial release, its reputation has improved since. It currently has a rating among critics of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes. Of course, it long ago became a cult film. Ultimately, Death Race 2000 is a camp classic that combines gratuitous violence with a sly sense of humour to satirize both the media and the government."},

His second album, Belafonte, released in 1956, would be the first number one album on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. His third album, Calypso, also went number one on the chart. It proved phenomenally successfully, becoming the first album to sell over 1 million copies. It also triggered a calypso craze that overtook the United States in the mid to late Fifties. Harry Belafonte continued to have success on the Billboard album chart, recording in several other genres, until The Beatles and the British Invasion in 1964. His live album Belafonte at The Greek Theatre would be his last to reach the top 40 of the Billboard Pop Albums Chart.

He possessed a powerful, yet elegant voice that made him one of the best singers of the era. It is little wonder that he sparked the calypso craze of the Fifties. Of course, while he was known as the King of Calypso, he performed in a variety of genres, including folk music, blues, gospel, and American standards. Few singers saw the success that Harry Belafonte did, with millions of records sold throughout his career.He was not only a talented singer, but also a talented actor. He shined as Joe, the soldier who became involved with the title character in Carmen Jones. What might have been his best performance was in Odds Against Tomorrow, in which he played Johnny Ingram, a nightclub singer who becomes part of a heist because of his gambling debt.

In Kansas City he played another gangster, Seldom Seen, who made Geechie in Uptown Saturday Night look tame in comparison. Harry Belafonte played a variety of roles throughout his career, playing characters who were very different from each other. He always gave good performances.Beyond being a talented actor and singer, Harry Belafonte was also a great activist and humanitarian. He was involved in the Civil Rights Movement, and was even close friends with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1961 Mr. Belafonte supported the Freedom Rides and voter registration drives.

{"title": "The 100th Anniversary of Bettie Page's Birth", "date": "Saturday, April 22, 2023", "text": "It was on this date 100 years ago that Bettie Page was born in Nashville, Tennessee. I eulogized Miss Page upon the occasion of her death in 2008, so I won't write an in-depth post now. Even so, I do want to say a few words about Bettie Page this evening. Short of a few Golden Age movie stars, there can be no doubt that Bettie Page is the most famous pinup of all time. Indeed, she has been called \"the Queen of the Pinups\" with good reason. Beyond her enduring popularity nearly seventy years after her pinup career ended, she may possibly be the most photographed woman of all time, with an estimated 20,000 photographs. Bettie Page would certainly have an impact on popular culture. She had a lasting impact on comic books. I have seen claims that the look of Batman's opponent Poison Ivy was originally inspired by Miss Page, although I have been unable to confirm that. Cliff Secord's love interest in Dave Stevens's comic book feature The Rocketeer, Betty, was based on Bettie Page. Dave Stevens would later meet Bettie Page and the two would become close friends. There would later be Bettie Page comic books, including series published by Dark Horse Comics and Dynamite Entertainment. Bettie Page also had an impact on pop music. It is fairly obvious that Katy Perry took her look (dark hair with bangs) from Bettie Page. And, of course, Bettie Page has inspired songs, including \"Bettie Page\" by Public Image Ltd. and Royal Crown Revue's song \"Port-au-Prince (Travels with Betty Page).\" Bettie Page would also have an impact on film. Her look inspired Jenny (as the character of Betty was renamed) in the 1991 film adaptation of The Rocketeer, as well as Rosario Dawson's character in Death Proof (2007). Burlesque model Dita Von Teese has drawn upon Bettie Page for inspiration from time to time. Today Bettie Page's image graces everything from kitchen magnets to Zippo lighters to playing cards.In tribute to Bettie Page on the 100th anniversary of her birth, here are a few of her classic photos (for those who worry about such things, they are all PG rated)."},
{"title": "\"Twilight Time\" by The Platters", "date": "Friday, April 21, 2023", "text": "My usual tree pollen allergies have me feeling a bit under the weather today, so instead of a full-fledged blog post, I thought I would leave you with a song. In this case, it's \"Twilight Time\" by the Platters. \"Twilight Time\" originated as a poem written by Samuel \"Buck\" Ram in college. Buck Ram's poem was later set to music by the instrumental group The Three Suns in 1944. The Three Suns recorded an instrumental version that same year. It was also that year that Les Brown and His Band of Renown recorded an instrumental version, which served as the \"B\" side of their single \"Sentimental Journey.\"It was in 1953 that Buck Ram began working with The Platters, and he wrote their first major hit, \"Only You (and You Alone).\" The Platters would have further hits, including \"The Great Pretender (also written by Buck Ram)\" in 1955 and \"My Prayer\" in 1956. The Platters recorded \"Twilight Time\" in 1958, complete with the lyrics Buck Ram had written years ago. Amazingly enough, Mercury Records decided that \"Twilight Time\" would be the B-side of \"Out of My Mind.\" Fortunately, \"Twilight Time\" would not remain the \"B\" side of a single for long, largely thanks to Dick Clark. The Platters were set to appear on The Dick Clark Saturday Night Beechnut Show. The Platters were set to sing \"Only You,\" \"The Great Pretender,\" and \"Out of My Mind.\" Fortunately, Buck Ram's assistant, Jean Bennett was able to convince the show's producer to let The Platters perform both \"Out of My Mind\" and \"Twilight Time\" after playing \"Twilight Time\" for Dick Clark over the phone. The following Monday morning Mercury was receiving orders for \"Twilight Time,\" not \"Out of My Mind.\"As it turned out, \"Twilight Time\" proved to be a huge hit for The Platters. It went to number one on both the Billboard pop singles and rhythm and blues chart. It peaked at no. 3 on the UK singles chart."},
{"title": "DVD Netflix is Shutting Down", "date": "Wednesday, April 19, 2023", "text": "It was only a little over a month ago that I wrote a post on the 25th anniversary of DVD Netflix. Sadly, it was yesterday that it was announced that Netflix will be shutting down its DVD-by-mail business. The last DVD will be sent out on September 29 2023.Sadly, DVD Netflix is not as big as it once was. In 2012 DVD Netflix clocked  $1,136.87 million. In 2020 it was down to $239 million. Its revenue fell to $183 million in 2021 and then fell to $146 million in 2022. As to what caused DVD Netflix, it seems like that the blame can be placed firmly on streaming. Netflix launched it streaming service in 2007 and it would grow to the point that it is now what Netflix is best known for. Of course, other streaming services would follow in its wake, including Hulu, Disney+, and HBO Max. Given a choice between choosing a movie from DVD Netflix and waiting for it to arrive in the mail and choosing  a movie on a streaming service and then watching it minutes later, many apparently chose the latter option.While there can be no doubt that many people deserted DVD Netflix in favour of streaming services, DVD Netflix still has a loyal following. DVD Netflix has one big advantage over the various streaming services. Quite simply, it has an enormous DVD library, allowing customers to watch movies that aren't currently available on streaming services. Want to watch Mask (1985)? Well, you can't do it on streaming, but it is available on DVD. The  Cannonball Run (1981)? It's not on streaming either, but it is on DVD. Even the classic Rebecca (1940) is not be found on streaming at the moment, but there have been several DVD releases. The death of DVD Netflix will then leave a hole for many movie and television buffs that won't easily be filled.Indeed, I have fond memories of watching DVDs I received in the familiar Netflix red envelopes. I rewatched the entire runs of the TV shows Nowhere Man and Crime Story by way of Netflix. I also watched such diverse movies as Quadrophenia (1979), Phantom of the Paradise (1974), Seven Samurai (1954), and Pandora's Box (1929) through DVD Netflix. The extensive library of DVD Netflix gave me access to far more movies and TV shows than all of the major streaming services combined currently do. Now I will admit that I don't know how much it cost to operate DVD Netflix. It could be that a good chuck of $146 million it made last year was devoured by operating costs. Regardless, it is a sad day for fans of physical media. DVD Netflix filled a niche that I suspect the streaming services never will."},
{"title": "The 85th Anniversary of Superman", "date": "Tuesday, April 18, 2023", "text": "It was 85 years ago today, on April 18 1938, that Action Comics no. 1 (June 1938) hit newsstands. It was historic for featuring the first appearance of Superman. Superman was not the first superhero, but he would be the one to have the most impact. In the wake of Superman there would be several other superheroes introduced in comic books, including Batman, The Flash, Captain Marvel, Green Lantern, Captain America, Wonder Woman, and more. As to Superman himself, the character was a veritable phenomenon in the late Thirties and Forties. There was a ton of merchandising, as well as adaptations to such media as radio, theatrical animated shorts, newspaper comic strips, and movie serials. In the Forties, there weren't many characters as big as Superman.Here I should point out that Superman was not the only character important in the history of DC Comics to make his first appearance in Action Comics no. 1. The magician Zatara also debuted in the magazine. Zatara would prove successful, appearing in Action Comics throughout the Golden Age of Comics Books. It would be Zatara who would inspire what might have been the first legacy hero in the history of comics. His better known daughter, Zatanna, first appeared in Hawkman no. 4 (November 1964), in a storyline in which she was searching for her father. It was one of the few times in the Silver Age that a storyline ran through several different titles. I have already written several posts on Superman over the years, including a history of the character for his 75th anniversary. Below are links to some of the posts I have made on the Man of Steel over the years.\"The Fleischer Superman Cartoons\"\"Superman, the 1948 Serial\"\"The 75th Anniversary of Superman\"\"The Superman Phenomenon in the Late Thirties and Early Forties\""},
{"title": "A Pictorial Tribute to Ann Miller", "date": "Wednesday, April 12, 2023", "text": "Ann Miller was born 100 years ago today. Long time readers of this blog probably realize that I am a big fan of Miss Miller. Indeed, she is my favourite dancer in motion pictures and one of my favourite actresses. I certainly think she was gorgeous, with dark hair and long legs. More importantly, she was an incredibly talented dancer. In fact, she has been credited as the fastest tap dancer in Golden Age of Hollywood.  She was also a talented actress, and played everything from the ambitious Nadine in Easter Parade (1948) to anthropologist Claire in On the Town (1949). For obvious reasons, Ann Miller was a popular pin-up from the early Forties into the late Fifties. I swear she did pinup pictures for nearly every major holiday. Here at A Shroud of Thoughts I am guessing she is the one actress to appear in nearly every one of my holiday pinup posts.Ann Miller was born Johnnie Lucille Collier on April 12 1923 in in Chireno, Texas. As a child she was afflicted with rickets. It was then that she began dance lessons at age five in an effort to strengthen her legs. Her parents divorced when she was nine years old, and she moved from Houston to Los Angeles with her mother. Her mother was almost entirely deaf, so that finding work was difficult for her. Ann Miller was five foot five when she was only twelve and looked older than she really was. It was then that she began dancing professionally to make a living for the family, taking the stage name \"Ann Miller.\" By age 13 she was a showgirl at the Bal Tabarin in San Francisco. Still only 13, she became a dancer at the Black Cat Club in San Francisco. It was either at the Bal Tabarin or the Black Cat Club that she was discovered by Lucille Ball and talent agent Benny Rubin. She was signed to RKO, falsely claiming to be 18.At RKO Ann Miller appeared in several movies, including Stage Door (1937), You Can't Take It With You (1938), and Room Service (1938). In 1941 she signed with Columbia Pictures, where she appeared in a number of B musicals, starting with Time Out for Rhythm (1941). Her contract with Columbia ended in 1945, after which she made a number of musicals for MGM, including Easter Parade (1948), On the Town (1949), Lovely to Look At (1952), Kiss Me Kate (1952), and The Opposite Sex (1957). Ann Miller's last movie for several years was The Great American Pastime (1956). By the mid-Sixties the Hollywood musical was going out of fashion, and the cinema had lost ground to television.Ann Miller turned from the cinema to the stage, appearing in such productions as Can-Can, Mame, Hello Dolly, Sugar Babies, and others. She also made infrequent appearances on television, appearing on such shows as Lux Video Theatre; Love, American Style; The Love Boat; and Home Improvement. In 1971 she starred in a famous commercial for The Great American Soup, created by Stan Freberg, that played as a production number of the sort seen in the classic Hollywood musicals. Her last two movies were Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood (1976) and Mulholland Drive (2001).  Ann Miller died at age 80 from lung cancer on January 22 2004.Below a number of photos of Ann Miller, including many of her famous holiday themed pinups."},

While its longest running contributor, Al Jaffee always worked as a freelancer and was never on the staff of Mad.Al Jaffee was born Abraham Jaffee on March 13 1921 in Savannah, Georgia. He spent part of his childhood in Zarasai, Lithuania, before returning to the United States to live with his father in Far Rockaway, New York. He attended the High School of Music and Art in New York. He took up the name \"Al\" as a means of avoiding anti-Semitism during World War II. He served in the United States Army. During the war he worked as an art instructor at a rehabilitation centre and later at the Pentagon where he made posters and pamphlets as part of the war effort.He began his career in comic books in 1942 with a parody of Superman called \"Inferior Man\" for Will Eisner's studio. The character in copies of  Military Comics, published by Quality Comics. That same year he worked on Joker Comics, a title published by would later become Marvel Comics. At what would become Marvel, he created the humour feature \"Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal.\" Mr. Jaffee worked for what would become Marvel Comics following World War II.It was in 1955, following its transition from a traditional comic book to a magazine format, that Al Jaffee's work first appeared in Mad. Al Jaffe also contributed to the magazines Trump and Humbug (both published in 1957), edited by Harvey Kurtzman, who had been the editor on Mad. From 1957 to 1963 he drew the comic strip Tall Tales for the New York Herald-Tribune. It was syndicated to over 100 newspapers. In the late Sixties and early Seventies he scripted the comic strips Debbie Deere and Jason. From April 1964 to April 2013, only one issue of Mad did not include new material created by Al Jaffee. He introduced the Mad Fold-In in 1964. His regular feature \"Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions\" also originated in Mad in the Sixties. He retired in 2020 at the age of 99.Al Jaffee was an extraordinary talent. Throughout his work he consistently poked fun at the idiocy and incompetence with which one so often meets in life. These themes are particularly seen in his \"Snappy Answers for Stupid Questions,\" but also in his Mad Fold-In. His work was not only filled with humour, but wit and sophistication as well. Quite simply, Al Jaffee was one of the great humorists of the 20th and 21st Centuries."},

Part Four", "date": "Friday, April 7, 2023", "text": "While an argument can be made that the company existed in some form before, it was on April 4 1923 that Warner Bros. Pictures Incorporated was formally organized. The studio pioneered the use of sound in movies and ushered in the era of talkies. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, Warner Bros. was one of the Big Five studios. While experiencing some difficulties in the Fifties, Warner Bros. expanded into television during the decade. In 1969 Warner Bros.-Seven Arts was bought by Kinney National Company.It was in September 1971 that Kinney National Company spun-off its non-entertainment interests (mostly  parking and property management services) into a new company, National Kinney Corporation. As to National Kinney Company, in November 1971 it bought the cable television operator Television Communications Corporation. It was in February 1972 that National Kinney Company would be renamed Warner Communications. Television Communications Corporation was then renamed Warner Cable in 1973. Warner Cable would later be sold to Charter Communications and became part of their Spectrum brand. As to Warner Communications, the conglomerate was the parent of Warner Bros., Warner Bros. Pictures, National Periodical Publications (soon to be officially named DC Comics), the Warner Music Group (WMG), Warner Books, and Warner Cable.The Seventies would prove to be a fairly good decade for Warner Bros., with such hit films as Dirty Harry (1971), Enter the Dragon (1973), The Exorcist (1973), Blazing Saddles (1974), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), All the President's Men (1976), and Superman (1978). The Eighties would also prove to be a fairly good decade with regards to movies for the studio, either producing and/or distributing such films as Superman II (1980), The Right Stuff (1983),  The Colour Purple (1985), Lethal Weapon (1987), Stand and Deliver (1988), Dangerous Liaisons (1988), and Batman (1989).Warner Bros. also continued to expand in the Eighties. In 1989 Warner Bros. bought Lorimar-Telepictures, which had produced such television shows as The Waltons, Eight is Enough, Dallas, and ALF. The acquisition also gave Warner Bros. the Allied Artists library and Rankin/Bass's  post-September 1974 library. The acquisition gave Warner Bros. control of the old MGM lot in Culver City as well. In other words, Warner Bros. now had two studio lots: the First National/Warner Bros. lot in Burbank and the old MGM lot in Culver City.While Warner Bros. had several successful movies in the Eighties, during the decade Warner Communications began experiencing financial difficulties. Much of this was due to the fact that Warner Communications owned Atari, Inc., and as a result took a hit from the video game crash of 1983. Warner Communications then sold off Atari. It was later in the decade that Warner Communications announced a merger with Time, Inc., publisher of such magazines as Time and Life.The merger between Warner Communications and Time, Inc. was very nearly derailed by a rival conglomerate, Paramount Communications, who attempted a hostile takeover for Time, Inc. After Time, Inc thwarted Paramount Communications' hostile bid, Paramount Communications filed a lawsuit in an attempt to block the Time, Inc./Warner Communications merger. The court ruled in favour of Time, Inc., and as a result Time, Inc. and Warner Communications merged to become Time Warner.The Nineties would prove to be a busy decade for Warner Bros. It was in 1993 that Time Warner entered into a joint venture with  Chris-Craft Industries to launch the Prime Time Entertainment Network (PTEN for short), a programming block of dramas targeted at the key demographic of television viewers. PTEN was launched as a potential fifth television network, although that never came to pass. Among the shows aired as part of PTEN were Babylon 5, Kung Fu, and Time Trax. The demise of PTEN would come about because of the creation of two new television networks. As early as October 1993 Chris-Craft Industries announced the formation of the United Paramount Network (UPN) as a joint venture with Paramount Television. It was in November 1993 that Time Warner announced its intention to launch its own network,. The WB, in conjunction with the Tribune Company.The WB launched on January 11 1995, its first show being the debut episode of The Wayan Brothers. The fledgeling network began with only one night of programming and gradually added more nights over time. It was in September 1995 that The WB added a weekday and Saturday morning programming block called \"Kids' WB.\" A few shows with roots in the history of Warner Bros. and DC Comics aired on the Kids' WB, including some shows that had originally aired elsewhere. These included the shows Animaniacs, The Sylvester  & Tweety Mysteries, Superman: The Animated Series, Bugs 'n' Daffy, and more. As to The WB itself, it would produce some memorable shows, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed, Felicity, Angel, Smallville, and Supernatural.Unfortunately, The WB would not be a success. In part this was because the network failed to expand beyond an extremely young demographic (12 to 24 years old) to the key demographic desired by Madison Avenue. Much of the reason for the network's failure may also have been because there did not appear to be enough room for two fledgeling networks, UPN having only launched days after The WB. It was then on January 24 2006 that , CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment announced the closures of UPN and The WB respectively At the same time they announced their plans to launch a new network, The CW, as a joint venture. The CW launched on January 24 2008. Like The WB before it, it drew heavily upon DC Comics. Among its biggest successes would be shows based on DC Comics superheroes, including Arrow, The Flash, and DC's Legends of Tomorrow. Unfortunately, The CW never proved to be profitable and WarnerMedia and ViacomCBS sold the network to Nexstar Media Group last year.It was in 1996, the year after The WB launched, that Time Warner acquired the Turner Broadcasting System, which owned the successful cable channels TBS, TNT, Turner Classic Movies, and CNN. Over the years the Turner Broadcasting System had also acquired several film libraries. In 1986 Turner bought  MGM/UA Entertainment Co. from Kirk Kerkorian. Turner sold  MGM/UA Entertainment Co. back to Kirk Kerkorian almost immediately, but kept MGM's pre-1986 library, the United States/Canadian distribution, rights to the RKO library, and the Associated Artists Productions library (which included Warner Bros. pre-1950 movies, and the Fleischer Studios/Famous Studios Popeye cartoons). In buying Turner, then, Time Warner effectively returned ownership of Warner Bros.' pre-1950 movies to Warner Bros. itself. In 1991 Turner acquired  the Hanna-Barbera animation studio, so that Time Warner now owned the classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons as well.Warner Bros. would continue to be successful into the 21st Century. In 2012 it would become one of only two studios (the others being Disney and Universal) to release two movies that crossed the billion dollar mark in the same year with The Dark Knight Rises and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Its parent conglomerate would also undergo changes. It was in 2013 that Time, Inc. was spun off into a separate company. It was in 2018 that Time Warner was acquired by AT&T. AT&T renamed the company WarnerMedia.It was last year that AT&T spun off Warner Media, which then merged with Discovery, Inc. to form the new company Warner Bros. Discovery. Discovery, Inc. was a company that owned such cable channels as the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, the Food Network, HGTV, and other cable channels centred on documentary shows and reality shows (some of them of questionable quality). It is difficult to say where Warner Bros. Discovery will go from here, but if they wish to be successful they would best draw upon the Warner Bros. legacy. Warner Bros. is one of the most successful studios of all time. Not only were they one of the Big Five during the Golden Age of Hollywood, but they are still a major studio today. During the Golden Age, MGM's slogan was \"more stars than there are in the heavens,\" but the slogan may have been more true of Warner Bros. Through the years such well known stars as Rin Tin Tin, John Garfield, Bette Davis, Olivia De Havilland, Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, Joan Crawford, Lauren Bacall, and James Dean have all been under contract to Warner Bros. It was with such stars that Warner Bros. produced some of the greatest movies of all time. Indeed, in AFI's list of the all time greatest movies, AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies, there are no less than 10 Warner Bros. movies, more than any other studio. Many of the studio's classics from the Golden Age are still recognizable to even casual viewers today. The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Maltese Falcon (1941), Casablanca (1942), The Big Sleep (1946), Rebel without a Cause (1955), among others, are still well-known to audiences. Of course, Warner Bros. did not only produce feature films. They may actually be best known for their classic theatrical cartoons. Over the years, they developed a large roster of highly successful cartoon characters, including Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Bugs Bunny, Tweety, Sylvester, and yet others. Bugs Bunny may well be the most successful animated character of all time. He has appeared in more movies than any other cartoon character, so many that according to Guinness World Records he is the ninth most portrayed character in film. Of course, Warner Bros. expanded into television in the Fifties, and many of its classic television shows are still watched to this day. Cheyenne, Maverick, 77 Sunset Strip, F Troop, Kung Fu, Wonder Woman, Night Court, ER, and The Gilmore Girls, among others,  are still popular with television viewers.  Warner Bros. would also expand into streaming, producing such streaming television shows as The Flight Attendant, Titans (based on the DC comic book of the same name), Doom Patrol (based on the DC comic book of the same name), and others.In its 100 years Warner Bros. has gone from being an independent studio to one of the Big Five to a multimedia giant. They produced some of the greatest feature films of all time. They produced some of the greatest theatrical animated shorts of time. They produced some of the greatest television shows of all time. With any luck Warner Bros. will last another 100 years, producing yet more classics."},
{"title": "The 100th Anniversary of Warner Bros. Part Three", "date": "Thursday, April 6, 2023", "text": "While arguably the company had existed in some form before, it was on April 4 1923 that Warner Bros. was formally organized. An independent studio throughout the Silent Era, Warner Bros. became a major studio with the advent of sound, which the studio pioneered. Throughout the Thirties and Forties, Warner Bros. remained one of the Big Five studios. It had some of the biggest stars of the era under contract, including Bette Davis, Olivia De Havilland, Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, and yet others. Like the other studios, the U.S. Supreme Court case United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. dealt a severe blow to Warner Bros. Decided on May 3 1948, it forced Warner Bros. and the other studios to divest themselves of their theatres and to stop block booking (the practice of selling films to theatres in batches), among other things. The Fifties would see Warner Bros. struggling to survive.Even so, Warner Bros. would see some successes in the Fifties. The late 1940s and early 1950s saw the return of the Warner Bros. musical. Starting with Romance on the High Seas in 1948, Warner Bros. released a series of successful musicals featuring singer Doris Day. Tea for Two (1950), Lullaby of Broadway (1951), April in Paris (1952),  and Calamity Jane (1953) all proved to be successful. The late Forties and early Fifties also saw Warner Bros. return to making swashbucklers, with such films as Adventures of Don Juan (1948), Captain Horatio Hornblower (1950), The Crimson Pirate (1952), and The Master of Ballantrae (1953). As might be expected, Warner Bros. continued to release crime dramas (many of them film noirs), including White Heat (1949), Storm Warning (1951),  Tomorrow is Another Day (1951), The Blue Gardenia (1953), and The System (1953).In addition to dealing with the aftermath of United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., in the late Forties and early Fifties Warner Bros. also faced what they and the other studios regarded as a threat: the young medium of television. Initially, Warner Bros. sought to deal with the threat of television by diversifying into it. Warner Bros. applied for an application for television stations in Chicago and five other cities in April 1948. It was that same year that Warner Bros. sought approval from the FCC for the studio to buy Los Angeles television station KLAC and two radio stations owned by Dorothy Thackery, former publisher of The New York Post. The FCC took so long in coming to a decision that Warner Bros. dismissed its applications for television stations and Dorothy Thackery cancelled her deal with the studio.As it was, Jack L. Warner was not particularly fond of the new medium. Not only did he forbid any Warner Bros. productions (even short subjects) from being used for television broadcasts, but he even forbid the appearance of any television sets in Warner Bros. motion pictures. Regardless, with the success of television it was inevitable that Warner Bros. would move into the new medium.Leonard Goldstein was head of American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc., the parent company of the American Broadcasting Company, better known simply as ABC. Leonard Goldstein had worked in Hollywood for twenty years and as a result had a good number of contacts in the film industry, among them Jack L. Warner. At the time ABC was struggling, so Leonard Goldstein wanted Warner Bros. to produce filmed television shows that would draw desperately needed viewers to the network. As for Warner Bros., they would receive publicity for their feature films. The negotiations between Warner Bros. and ABC did not always go smoothly. An offer from ABC to pay Warner Bros. the same amount they had paid Disney ($2 million), as well as a request to show recent Warner Bros. movies (among them Casablanca) was flatly rejected by the studio. Fortunately, ABC and Warner Bros. were eventually able to work out a deal. Warner Bros.' initial foray into television was an umbrella title called Warner Bros. Presents. It rotated three series, two of which were based on popular Warner Bros. movies: Kings Row (based on the 1942 movie of the same name) and Casablanca (based on the 1942 movie of the same name). The third series aired under the Warner Bros. Presents umbrella was Cheyenne, which was historic as the first hour long Western television series. Unlike Kings Row and Casablanca, it was an original series not based on an existing property. Each edition of the show ended with a ten to fifteen minute segment entitled \"Behind the Camera\", hosted by Gig Young, that promoted such films as The Searchers (1956) and Giant (1956). Warner Bros. Presents debuted on ABC on September 20 1955. Warner Bros. Presents  would not prove to be a success, with Kings Row cancelled at mid-season and Casablanca cancelled at the end of the season. Only Cheyenne survived. For the 1956-1957 season Cheyenne rotated with an anthology series entitled Conflict (the title having been chosen by ABC rather than Warner Brothers). Conflict proved to be a failure, but  Cheyenne continued to be a success.Conflict was cancelled at the end of the 1956-1957 season.The success of Cheyenne would lead to Warner Bros. producing other Western television shows for ABC, including Sugarfoot, Maverick, Lawman, Colt .45, and Bronco. The most successful of the Western TV series would be Maverick, one of whose stars, James Garner, would go onto a successful film career. The Warner Bros. Western television shows all existed in the same shared universe, so that characters from Maverick might appear on Sugarfoot and so on. With 77 Sunset Strip in 1958 Warner Bros. began producing a number of detective shows as well, including Bourbon Street Beat, Hawaiian Eye, and Surfside Six. Like their Westerns, Warner Bros.' detective shows also existed in the same shared universe.Warner Bros. Television would continue to be successful into the early Sixties. The studio brought their animated cartoons made after 1948 to television with The Bugs Bunny Show in 1960 and produced such successful shows as F Troop and The F.B.I. There would be a lull in Warner Bros. Television's production from 1967 to 1971 when they only produced The F.B.I., but the Seventies would see the production of such shows as Kung Fu, Wonder Woman, and The Dukes of Hazzard. Since then Warner Bros. has produced several hit television shows, including Night Court, Murphy Brown, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, Babylon 5, and ER.Before their entry into television, Warner Bros. also sought ways to better compete with the new medium. Like the other studios, Warner Bros. embraced 3D, releasing their first 3D film House of Wax in 1953. The 3D fad soon faded, so that Warner Bros. had to look for other ways to compete with television. Harry Warner then made the decision to begin releasing films made in CienmaScope, Unfortunately, 1956 saw Warner Bros.' profits decline significantly from previous years. Jack L. Warner even took the drastic measure of selling the studio's pre-1950 films to Associated Artists Productions in 1956. This angered Harry Warner, whose relationship with his brother was already tumultuous. It was then in May 1956 that the Warner brothers put Warner Bros. on the market. What the other brothers did not realize is that Jack L. Warner had organized a syndicate to buy 90% of Warner Bros.' stock. Jack L. Warner then sold his stocks, just like his brothers, only to buy them right back. In the end, Jack L. Warner was Warner Bros.' majority stockholder. He appointed himself president.Warner Bros. would turn around in the late Fifties and early Sixties. The studio released a number of successful films based on plays, including Baby Doll (1956), The Bad Seed (1956), Damn Yankees (1958), The Music Man (1962), and Gypsy (1962). As the Sixties progressed, however, the film industry began to change. Film production was in decline by the mid-Sixties, as were the profits of Warner Bros. and the other major studios. The mid-Sixties saw the rise of New Hollywood, whereby a film's director played a more vital role than the studio producing the movie.Warner Bros. itself would see major changes from the mid to late Sixties. Largely because of his wife persuading him to slow as well as feeling his age, Jack L. Warner sold his control of Warner Bros. to Seven Arts Productions in November 1966. The company was then renamed Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. Jack Warner remained with Warner Bros. as a vice president and an independent producer.As it turned out Warner Bros-Seven Arts. would soon have new owners.  Eliot and Kenneth Hyman (the founders of Seven Arts Productions) quickly grew tired of having to deal with Jack L. Warner. It was then in January 1969 that they sold Warner Bros.-Seven Arts to Kinney National Company. Kinney National Company promptly changed the studio's name back to \"Warner Bros.\" The sale did not make Jack L. Warner happy and he made the move into independent production. He was the last of the Old Hollywood moguls.Beyond Jack L. Warner moving into independent production, the acquisition of Warner Bros. by Kinney National Company would have another effect on Warner Bros. It was in 1967 that Kinney National Company bought National Periodical Publications, the comic book company then known informally as \"DC Comics.\" This would provide Warner Bros. with a number of well-established popular characters. Starting with the failed television pilot Wonder Woman starring Cathy Lee Crosby and the  TV series Wonder Woman starring Lynda Carter in 1975, Warner Bros.would either produce and/or distribute a number of projects based on DC Comics characters, including such classic films as Superman (1978), Superman II (1980), and Batman (1989). With the acquisition, Warner Bros.' fortunes also turned around. Starting with the documentary Woodstock (1970), Warner Bros. would have a number of hits in the Seventies, including Dirty Harry (1971), Enter the Dragon (1973), The Exorcist (1973), Blazing Saddles (1974), and others.Warner Bros. ultimately made it out of the Golden Age of Hollywood and survived through the Fifties and Sixties. The coming years would see yet more changes at Warner Bros."},
{"title": "The 100th Anniversary of Warner Bros. Part Two", "date": "Wednesday, April 5, 2023", "text": "Although it can be argued the company had existed in some form earlier, it was on April 4 1923 that Warner Bros. Pictures Incorporated was formally organized. It was that same year that their first major star emerged, a talented German Shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. In the mid to late Twenties, Warner Bros. pioneered the use of sound. After a number of short subjects with sound, they released Don Juan (1926), the first feature-length film to utilize Warner Bros.' Vitaphone sound-on-disc sound system. It was the following year that they released The Jazz Singer (1927), the first movie with a synchronized recorded music score as well as synchronous singing and speech. Warner Bros.' early films with sound not only revolutionized the film industry. They also took Warner Bros. from being an independent studio to one of the Big Five studios. Warner Bros. was quick to take advantage of its sound technology. The introduction of sound made a genre that was popular on stage possible in film: musicals. Warner Bros.' first musical feature film, The Singing Fool, premiered on September 19 1928 in New York City. Like The Jazz Singer before it, it was only part talkie, more or less a silent movie with musical interludes. It proved enormously successful and would remain the highest grossing motion picture until Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937. It was largely the success of The Singing Fool that led Warner Bros. to release a number of successful musicals in the late Twenties into the Thirties. Among these were On with the Show! (1929), the first all-talking, all-colour musical; Show Girl in Hollywood (1930); Manhattan Parade (1931); 42nd Street (1933); Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933); Footlight Parade (1933); and many others. Of course, the early era of talkies was also the Pre-Code Era. While the Production Code was adopted in 1930, enforcement of the Code was lax and the studios often pushed the boundaries with regards to what was permitted on the big screen. Warner Bros. was no different from the other studios and, in fact, may have pushed the envelope as to what was allowed in movies more than some of the others. It was in the early Thirties that Warner Bros. began releasing socially realistic films, nearly all of them sympathetic to the common man. Movies such as Lawyer Man (1932), Man Wanted (1932), Baby Face (1933), and Convention City (1933) were grounded in reality and could be risqué. And while today we associate musicals with escapism, Warner Bros.' early musical reflected the social realism of the studio's dramas and comedies of the era. Indeed, the climax of 42nd Street includes the risqué song \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\" and simulated scenes of violence during the title song. Like other studios Warner Bros. released horror movies in the early Thirties, and even these tended to be grittier and more provocative than those put out by other studios. Both Doctor X (1932) and Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933) are intense by today's standards. Among the movies grounded in social realism released by Warner Bros. during the era were their well-known gangster movies. The studio released Little Caesar on January 9 1931 and the film proved to be an enormous success. It was followed by several other gangster and crime movies, including The Public Enemy (1931) and  I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932). The end of the Pre-Code Era would mark the end of the gangster movie as it existed in the early Thirties, although Warner Bros. would continue to release crime movies throughout its history. The Pre-Code Era would come to an end on July 1 1934. Religious groups had become increasingly concerned about the content of Hollywood films. In 1933  John T. McNicholas, Archbishop of Cincinnati founded the Catholic Legion of Decency (later renamed the National Legion of Decency), an organization formed to fight the \"immorality\" of films. With moral watchdogs opposing the film industry in greater numbers, an amendment was added to the Production Code on June 13 1934 that required all films made after July 1 1934 to be submitted to the Production Code Administration to get a seal of approval before they could be released. The Pre-Code Era was officially over.For Warner Bros. this meant an end to the socially realistic movies of the early Thirties, as well as the gangster movies. The popularity of musicals had gone into decline towards the middle of the decade, although the studio would continue to release musicals, albeit in fewer numbers than in the early Thirties. The mid-Thirties then saw Warner Bros. shift towards historical movies and swashbucklers. Captain Blood (1935), starring Errol Flynn, proved to be an enormous success and led to a series of hit swashbuckler movies starring the actor, including The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936) and The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Of course, throughout the Thirties, Warner Bros. distributed theatrical cartoons. It was in 1930 that Leon Schlesinger signed a contract with the studio to produce cartoons. To make the cartoons he signed animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Isling. It was these two animators who introduced the Looney Tunes series in 1930 and the Merrie Melodies series in 1931. Harman and Isling had a financial dispute with Leon Schesinger in 1933 and left the producer. It was then that Leon Schlesinger formed Leon Schlesinger Productions to make cartoons for Warner Bros. Over time Leon Schlesinger Productions would introduce some of the most successful cartoon characters of all time: Porky Pig in 1935, Daffy Duck in 1937, Elmer Fudd in 1940, and Bugs Bunny in 1940. While Walt Disney dominated theatrical cartoons in the Thirties, Warner Bros. dominated the medium from the Forties onwards.In 1944 Leon Schlesinger sold Leon Schlesinger Productions to Warner Bros., where upon it became Warner Bros. Cartoons, Inc. While Warner Bros. Cartoons were some of the studio's most successful products, Jack L. Warner did not hold them in a particularly high regard. In fact, at a rare meeting with the makers of Warner Bros. cartoons in 1953, Jack L. Warner not only admitted to not knowing where the animation studio was located, but said, \"The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse.\" Of course, Mickey Mouse was and still is a Disney character, not a Warner character. It was in 1955 that Warner Bros. sold all of its cartoons made before 1948 to Associated Artists Productions. With a few interruptions, Warner Bros. Cartoons more or less continued until 1969 when it finally closed. It was the success of The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie (1979) that led to the re-establishment of the cartoon studio as Warner Bros. Animation in 1980. Warner Bros. Animation would not only produce new theatrical cartoons, but also such television shows as Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, Batman: The Animated Series, and others.To a degree the movies Warner Bros. made in the Forties reflected what they had made in the mid to late Thirties. Warner Bros. would continue making comedies in the new decade, including such entries as The Strawberry Blonde (1941), The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942), Princess O'Rourke (1943), Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), and Christmas in Connecticut (1945). It was during the Thirties that Warner Bros. first started making what is known as woman's pictures, movies featuring female protagonists, female-centred storylines, and meant to appeal to a female audience. From the Thirties into the Forties, Warner Bros. released such woman's pictures as Jezebel (1938), Dark Victory (1939), The Letter (1940), Now, Voyager (1942), and Mildred Pierce (1945). Although Joan Crawford fans might disagree, an argument can be made that Bette Davis was the Queen of Woman's Pictures at Warner Bros. In 1932 Bette Davis signed to Warner Bros. and she would prove to be one of their most popular stars. She ranked in the Quigley Poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars for several years.World War II would see changes at Warner Bros., even before the United States entered the war. Harry Warner oversaw the production of several anti-German films, including Confessions of a Nazi Spy (1939), Sergeant York (1941), and You're in the Army Now (1941). Once the war began, Warner Bros. began making war movies. They also cut their film production in half. Many of the films Warner Bros. produced during the war years also served as propaganda in support of the war. Examples of these movies are Casablanca (1942), Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), This is the Army (1943), and Mission to Moscow (1943). It was shortly before World War II that one of Warner Bros.' biggest stars emerged. Humphrey Bogart proved to be a sensation in The Petrified Forest (1936) and was signed to a contract with Warner Bros. He found himself largely playing supporting roles in which he was a gangster or, at the very least, a tough guy. It was High Sierra (1941) that transformed Humphrey Bogart into a star. Mr Bogart followed it with some of Warner Bros.' most iconic films The Maltese Falcon (1941), Casablanca (1942), The Big Sleep (1946), and others.It was in 1943 that Warner Bros. would find itself at odds with one of its major stars. Olivia De Havilland, who had signed with the studio in 1935, sued Warner Bros. for breach of contract. She had fulfilled her seven year contract, only to be informed that six months were added to her contract to cover the times she was suspended. It was then that she filed a suit against Warner Bros, seeking a judgement that she was no longer held to the contract. It was only a little over a year after the suit had been filed that the California Court of Appeal for the Second District decided in her favour. The resulting judicial decision is still known to this day as \"the De Havilland Law.\" The last years of World War II would see the development of a new style of film in which Warner Bros. movies had played a role: film noir. Both High Sierra (1941) and The Maltese Falcon (1941) served as blueprints for the noir movement.  It was in 1944 that film noir really began to take shape with the release of such films as Double Indemnity (Paramount, 1944), Laura (20th Century Fox, 1944), and The Woman in the Window (RKO, 1944). Warner Bros. would release its own film noirs, including Mildred Pierce (1945), The Big Sleep (1946), Her Kind of Man (1946), Whiplash (1948), White Heat (1949), and others. Warner Bros. would continue to release film noirs throughout the classic period of noir (roughly from the mid-Forties to the mid-Fifties).Initially the years after the war would be good for Warner Bros., despite a strike by its employees in September 1946. The studio posted record profits. It had developed such new stars as Lauren Bacall. And it bought  Pathé News from RKO in 1947. Unfortunately, Warner Bros. was party to the famous antitrust case United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. Despite the name of the case, it was not only against Paramount. The rest of the Big Five, as well as the Little Three (Universal, United Artists, and Columbia) were named in the suit as well. It was on May 3 1948 that the Supreme Court decided the case against the studios. Among other things, the studios had to divest themselves of their theatres and cease block booking (in which multiple films, both short subjects and features, would be sold to theatres all together). The United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. degree essentially brought an end to the studio system and dealt a major blow to the major studios.While United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. dealt a serious blow to Warner Bros. and the other studios, Warner Bros. would hardly be down for the count. While there would be lean years and good years ahead, the years following the Forties would see the studio expand into new media and continue to release classic films."},
{"title": "The 100th Anniversary of Warner Bros. Part One", "date": "Tuesday, April 4, 2023", "text": "It was 100 years ago today, on April 4 1923, that Warner Bros. was formally organized. The would pioneer the use of sound in movies, releasing both  the first movie with both synchronized recorded music score as well as lip-synchronous singing and speech (The Jazz Singer in 1927) and the first all talking feature (Lights of New York in 1928). They also pioneered the use of colour in film, with the first all-colour, all-talking feature (On With the Show! in 1929). Warner Bros. would go onto become one of the Big Five studios of the Golden Age of Hollywood, known for such stars as James Cagney, Bette Davis,  and Humphrey Bogart, their animated cartoons, and much more.Of course, while Warner Bros. was formally organized in 1923, an argument can be made that the company existed in some form well before that. In fact, it was largely because of second youngest Warner brother Sam that they entered into the movie business. Sam worked as a movie projectionist at Idora Park, an amusement park in Youngstown, Pennsylvania. He saw the possibilities of the medium and as a result persuaded his family to back him in buying a used projector. His two older brothers, Harry and Albert, then joined him in showing movies in the mining towns around Pennsylvania and Ohio in 1903. The venture proved successful enough that they opened a movie theatre, the Cascade, in New Castle, Pennsylvania. It was in 1904 that they founded the Duquesne Amusement & Supply Company to distribute movies. It was in 1909 that the name most associated with Warner Bros, youngest brother Jack, was brought into the family business.It would not be long before the Warner brothers would go from exhibiting and distributing films to actually producing them. It was in 1918 that hey opened the first Warner Bros. studio on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. The first movie ever produced by the Warner brothers was My Four Years in Germany, released in 1918. It was based on the book of the same name by former United States Ambassador to Germany James W. Gerard. The Warner brothers would release several films before the studio was formally organized in 1923. Sadly, most of those films are lost. While the Warner brothers had been releasing movies for a few years, it was on April 4 1923 that Warner Bros. Pictures, Incorporated was formally organized. The first movie released by the formally organized Warner Bros. Pictures, Incorporated was Main Street (1923), now considered a lost film. It was that same year that Warner Bros.' first major star emerged. Rin Tin Tin had appeared as a wolf in  The Man from Hell's River (1922) and the family dog in My Dad (1922), but with Where the North Begins (1923) he had a starring role. Where the North Begins became Warner Bros.' first major hit and turned Rin Tin Tin into a star. He appeared in 24 more movies.Warner Bros. began to grow not long after it was formally organized. It was in 1924 that Goldman Sachs provided financing for Waner Bros. to open two theatres in New York and Hollywood. The next year, in 1925, that Goldman Sachs arranged for a loan so that Warner Bros. could purchase Vitagraph Studios. This not only gave Warner Bros. control of Vitagraph's Brooklyn studio, but ten theatres as well. Another acquisition, this one made in 1926, would be historic for Warner Bros. and film history in general. Since the 1910s Western Electric's Bell Laboratories had been been developing sound-on-disc and sound-on-film technologies for movies. Sam Warner visited Bell Laboratories where their sound-on-disc system made an impression on It was in 1926, then, that Warner Bros. bought the sound-on-disc system from Wester Electric. Warner Bros. formed Vitaphone Corporation to advance this new sound technology. Over the next five years, Warner Bros. would release over 1000 short subjects with sound. Warner Bros.' first feature film to use the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system was Don Juan (1926), which featured a synchronized film score and sound effects, but no spoken dialogue. The film proved to be a success at the box office and was, at the time, the most expensive film Warner Bros. had made. Unfortunately, it was so expensive that it failed to recoup its rather hefty budget. That could have been the end of Warner Bros.' experiments with film, but Sam Warner persisted and even threatened to leave the company unless they produced more sound on film. It was then that on October 6 1927 that The Jazz Singer premiered in New York City. It was the first first movie with both synchronized recorded music score as well as synchronous singing and speech. The Jazz Singer (1927) proved enormously successful and changed movie history forever. It would be followed by The Lights of New York, the first all talking feature film, which premiered on July 6 1928. The Silent Era had ended and the age of the Talkies had begun.It was in 1928 that Warner Bros. bought Stanley Theatres, one of the biggest theatre chains in the United States. Stanley Theatres owned one-third of rival studio First National, which Stanley Theatres had shares in. This would result in a bidding war with William Fox of Fox Film Corporation in which Warner Bros. wound up buying even more shares of First National. Warner Bros. would entirely take over First National in 1929, when they bought the one third of the studio owned by William Fox. Warner Bros. them moved from its Sunset Boulevard address to First National's lot in Burbank, essentially the modern day Warner Bros. lot. Although owned by Warner Bros. movies would continue to be released under First National through 1934. It was in 1936 that the stockholders of First National voted to dissolve the studio.The success of  their sound movies would transform Warner Bros. from an independent to a major studio. Throughout the Golden Age of Hollywood, Warner Bros. would be one of the Big Five studios. And while the studio had achieved a good deal during the Silent Era, its best years were yet to come."},
{"title": "Godspeed Comic Book Writer Steve Skeates", "date": "Sunday, April 2, 2023", "text": "Comic book writer Steve Skeates, best known for co-creating Hawk and Dove, as well as a long run on Aquaman, died on March 30 2023 at the age of 80. Steve Skeates was born on January 29 1943 in Rochester, New York. Growing up he was a fan of both humour magazines and comic books (although he preferred funny animals to superheroes). He attended Alfred University in Alfred, New York. It was as he was nearing graduation that Steve Skeates applied to the four major comic book companies. It was then in 1965 that he was hired as Stan Lee's assistant editor at Marvel Comics. He only lasted two weeks, as he was not particularly good at proofreading. Fortunately, while he was no longer an assistant editor, Stan Lee did give him some freelance writing assignments, including work on the Marvel Western titles Kid Colt Outlaw and Two-Gun Kid.Steve Skeates then picked up work at Tower Comics, writing issues of T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, Noman, and Undersea Agent. The late Sixties saw Mr. Skeates do considerable work at DC Comics, including his run on Aquaman as well as work on Date with Debbi, Debbi's Dates, and Spectre. He co-created Hawk and Dove with Steve Ditko and wrote four issues of their title. He also wrote for Charlton, writing on the titles Abbott & Costello, a back-up story featuring The Question in Blue Beetle, Charlton Premiere, The Gunfighters, the Thane of Bagarth back-up stories in Hercules, a Sarge Steel back-up in Judomaster, The Many Ghosts of Dr. Graves, Outlaws of the West, Fightin' 5 backup stories in Peacemaker, Secret Agent, and Timmy the Ghost.The Seventies saw Steve Skeates also writing for multiple comic book companies. At DC Comics he wrote Adventure Comics, Blackhawk, DC Super Stars, The Flash, Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion, House of Mystery, House of Secrets, The Mighty Isis, Phantom Stranger, Plastic Man, Plop!, Secrets of Haunted House, Star Spangled War Stories, Super-Team Family, Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen, Teen Titans, Unknown Soldier, Weird Mystery Tales, Weird War Tales, Weird Western Tales, The Witching Hour, and World's Finest. He also worked on Marvel on the titles Chamber of Chills, Crazy Magazine, Journey into Mystery, Monsters Unleashed, Sub-Mariner, and What If...?. At Gold Key he wrote issues of The Twilight Zone, Underdog, and Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny. At Archie Comics he wrote on Red Circle Sorcery. He also did work at Warren Publishing (Creepy, Eerie, Vampirella) and Star Reach (Star Reach and Quack!). Steve Skeates's work on comic books slowed in the Eighties, and late in the decade he took up bartending. He still did some work during the decade, including writing for DC (DC Graphic Novel, House of Mystery, Secrets of Haunted House) and Marvel (Bizarre Adventures, Crazy Magazine, Howard the Duck, Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham, Savage Sword of Conan, and Savage Tales). In the mid-Eighties he wrote episodes of the animated TV shows Transformers, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, and Jem.  In the late Eighties he also did a locally oriented newspaper strip in Upstate New York titled The Adventures of Stew Ben and Alec Gainey. Since the Nineties Steven Skeates wrote for various companies. He wrote very nearly until his death.One of the first comic books I ever read was one of the issues of Aquaman authored by Steve Skeates. To this day I don't think anyone wrote Aquaman as well as he did. Quite simply, he was one of the best writers to emerge from the Silver Age of comics. He was certainly versatile. While his first love was humour, during his career he wrote superhero comics, horror comics, Western comics, war comics, and more. There didn't seem to be a genre he could not write. What is more, he was able to take a character and do things with that character that no one else had ever considered. Indeed, Aquaman had spent most of his history as a back-up character in various titles before getting his own title in the Sixties. Steve Skeates took the character places he had never been before. Few comic book writers were ever as gifted as Steve Skeates."},

{"title": "Rory Calhoun in Motel Hell (1980)", "date": "Friday, March 31, 2023", "text": "(This post is part of the Favorite Stars in B Movies Blogathon, hosted by Films From Beyond the Time Barrier)\"It takes all kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincent's Fritters.\" Vincent Smith (Rory Calhoun)In the Fifties Rory Calhoun was a star. He played secondary male leads in such films as I'd Climb the Highest Mountain (1951),  Meet Me After the Show (1951), and  River of No Return (1954). He was the male lead in  Rogue River (1951),  With a Song in My Heart (1952), and Way of the Gaucho (1952).  He even played Betty Grable's love interest in How to Marry A Millionaire (1953). He starred in and produced the Western television series The Texan. The Sixties saw Rory Calhoun appearing more frequently on television, as well as in B-movies. Among the B-movies in which Rory Calhoun appeared later in his career is Motel Hell (1980). The black comedy received mixed reviews from critics, but has since become a cult film.In Motel Hell (1980), Rory Calhoun stars as Vincent Smith, the successful owner of a line of smoked meats, Farmer Vincent's Fritters, alongside his sister Ida (Nancy Smith). Vincent and Ida also operate a motel on their farm, Motel Hello. The \"o\" on the sign burned out long ago, so that it now reads \"Motel Hell.\"Given this is a horror movie, people travelling roads nearby Motel Hello have a tendency to disappear. It is one of those disappearances that leads Sheriff Bruce Smith (Paul Linke), Vincent's younger brother, to learn the awful truth about the source of his brother's fritters.Motel Hell was produced and written by Robert Jaffe and Steven-Charles Jaffe. The two brothers were the sons of literary agent Herb Jaffe, who handled such well known writers as  Paddy Chayefsky and Joseph Heller, among others. Robert Jaffe is an actor who had appeared in films as Fuzz (1972) and The Mechanic (1972). He was also one of the co-writers of the screenplay for Demon Seed (1977). Motel Hell would be the first screenplay ever written by Steven-Charles Jaffe, who had served as an associate producer on Demon Seed and Time After Time (1979). It would also be the first screenplay the two would co-write together. According to Steven-Charles Jaffe in an article on the film in Fangoria no. 9 (November 1980), the two brothers decided to write something together and thought of doing a horror movie. They had a working draft of the screenplay finished in four weeks. While the screenplay for Motel Hell was completed in 1977, it would take some time for the Jaffe brothers to sell it. In the aforementioned Fangoria article, Stephen-Charles Jafee said that the script received two sorts of reactions from studios, \"They either hated it or they thought it was the most bizarre script they'd ever read, but were afraid of it and delivered a polite rejection.\" United Artists was initially among the studios that \"delivered a polite rejection.\" Fortunately, for the Jaffe brothers, there would be changes at United Artists. The studio contacted them and struck a production deal with them. Motel Hell would be directed by English director Kevin Connor, who had already directed one horror film, the classic Amicus portmanteau film From Beyond the Grave (1974), as well as such movies as The Land That Time Forgot (1974) and At the Earth Core (1976). Kevin Connor had just migrated to Los Angeles when agent Bob Litman directed him to another agent who had received an enquiry for a director for the movie Motel Hell. Kevin Connor then visited United Artists where he showed From Beyond the Grave to the Jaffe brothers. The two loved From Beyond the Grave and so gave him a copy of the Motel Hell script to read. After having read the script, Kevin Connor agreed to direct Motel Hell so long as Robert and Steven-Charles Jaffe made it a black comedy and removed all unnecessary crudeness. The brothers agreed and Kevin Connor then directed Motel Hell. Kevin Connor's first choice to play Farmer Vincent Smith was Harry Dean Stanton. Mr. Stanton turned the part down, and so the role went to Rory Calhoun. It would be Mr. Calhoun's first lead role in years. Nancy Parsons, who played Ida, had appeared in small parts in films as well as guest appearances on television. Today Paul Linke, who played Bruce, may be best known as Grossman on the TV show CHiPs. Before Motel Hell he had appeared in such films as Big Bad Mama (1974), The Strongest Man in the World (1975), and Grand Theft Auto (1977). The role of Bruce was written specifically for Paul Linke, who had attended college with Robert Jaffe.Motel Hell (1980) premiered on October 18 1980 and received mixed reviews. Indeed, two of my favourite critics held totally opposite views of the film. Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars and wrote, \"Motel Hell is a welcome change of pace; it's to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as Airplane! is to Airport.\" Leonard Maltin gave it only one and a half stars. Other critics were similarly divided. John Stanley in Rick Chatenever of The Santa Cruz Sentinel did not care for the movie either, writing that it, \"...offers precious few tricks, and even fewer treats...\" People magazine gave it a fairly positive review, noting, \"Calhoun does justice to an often ridiculous script.\"Motel Hell made $6.3 million at the box office, more than recouping its production costs. And while it may not have been one of the biggest films of 1980, it would go onto become a cult film through airings on the various premium channels and through home video. Motel Hell has even aired on Turner Classic Movies, cementing its place among cult classics. Of course, much of the reason Motel Hell maintains a following to this day is quite simply Rory Calhoun. He endows Farmer Vincent with a relaxed, country charm, endearing himself to the viewer even as they know full well what nefarious deeds he has been up to. As Vincent Smith, Rory Calhoun also offers the perfect balance between sanity and derangement that the role requires. Both Nancy Parsons, as Vincent's none-too-bright sister Ida, and Paul Linke, as Vincent's at times naive brother Bruce, also deliver good performances. It's largely their performances that make the film, whose script can at times border on the unbelievable, work. While the script for Motel Hell does at times border on the unbelievable, it still somehow works. It is a sharp satire of consumerism with a wickedly dark sense of humour. Indeed, more so than other horror movies or comedies of the time, it has several quotable lines (\"Meat's meat and a man's gotta eat.\").Motel Hell would hardly revive Rory Calhoun's career. In the last years of his career he continued to appear in such B-movies as Angel (1984) and Hell Comes to Frogtown (1988) in supporting roles. What Motel Hell did for Rory Calhoun was give him one last memorable lead role. He may have played Eben in How to Marry a Millionaire and Jesse Hill in Ain't Misbehavin', not to mention many roles in Westerns, but many of us will always remember him best as Farmer Vincent Smith in Motel Hell."},
{"title": "The Late Great Comic Book Artist Joe Giella", "date": "Thursday, March 30, 2023", "text": "Comic book artist Joe Giella, best known for inking Carmine Infantino and Gil Kane during the Silver Age, died on March 21 2023 at the age of 94.Joe Giella was born on June 27 1928 in Queens, New York City. He studied at the School of Industrial Art and the Art Students League, both in Manhattan, and took courses in art at Hunter College in New York City. He began his career at age 17, working for Hillman Periodicals. He freelanced for Fawcett Comics, inking stories featuring Captain Marvel. He joined the staff at what would later become Marvel Comics, working on stories featuring Captain Marvel, The Human Torch, and The Sub-Mariner. It was in 1949 that he joined National Comics Publications, the company now known as DC Comics. He worked on stories featuring the Golden Age Flash, the Golden Age Green Lantern, Black Canary, and various other characters edited by Julius Schwartz. In the Fifties, as superheroes fell by the wayside at DC Comics, Joe Giella inked Western stories pencilled by Alex Toth and Gene Colan, and the King Faraday stories in the title Danger Trail. During the Atomic Age of Comics, he inked Gil Kane on science fiction stories, Western stories, and crime stories.It was with Showcase no. 4 (October 1956) that editor Julius Schwartz introduced a new version of The Flash, launching the Silver Age of Comic books and a revival of superheroes. Joe Giella inked Carmine Infantino on the new Flash series and later Gil Kane on the new Green Lantern series. He also inked the earliest Adam Strange stories in the title Mystery in Space. Perhaps the most important story every inked by Joe Giella (or any comic book artist) was \"The Flash of Two Worlds\" in The Flash (September 1961), which re-introduced the Golden Age Flash and introduced the DC Multiverse. In 1964, when Julius Schwartz took over as editor of the Batman titles, Joe Giella became the inker for Carmine Infantino on Detective Comics and Sheldon Moldoff on Batman. He stayed with the Batman titles through the Batmania created by the TV series that ran from 1966 to 1968.Joe Giella continued to work at DC Comics through the Seventies, but also began work on various newspaper comic strips. He began inking on Don Barry on Flash Gordon in 1970. He worked on The Phantom for 17 years, even helping Sy Barry with pencilling. He took over as the artist on Mary Worth in 1991 and continued to work on the comic strip until his retirement in 2016. In addition to his work on comic books and newspaper strips, he also did work for advertising agencies such as  McCann Erickson and Saatchi & Saatchi, as well as such publishers as Doubleday and Simon & Schuster. In 2001 Joe Geilla worked on issue no. 2 on the mini-series Batman: Turning Points. Joe Giella will always be most identified with the Silver Age at DC Comics, inking numerous stories featuring The Flash, Adam Strange, Green Lantern, and Batman. Indeed, it was Joe Giella's style that was chosen as the house style at DC Comics during the Sixties. His style was clean, crisp, fluid, and, most importantly, modern. It was Joe Giella who made Sheldon Moldoff's work on Batman look more modern, this after Sheldon Moldoff had been emulating the work of Golden Age artist and Batman co-creator Bob Kane for years. While other comic book fans might not agree with me, I think Joe Giella often made the art of various pencillers look much better. I don't think Carmine Infantino's work every looked as good as when it was inked by Joe Giella. If he was prolific and had a long career, it was because Joe Giella was so very talented."},

{"title": "The X-Files: \"Home\"", "date": "Saturday, March 25, 2023", "text": "It seems quite likely that The X-Files was the most popular science fiction series of the Nineties. What is more, it still maintains a huge following world-wide.  For those unfamiliar with the show, The X-Files stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, who are assigned to investigate the \"X-files,\" unsolved cases that cannot be easily explained and often involve the paranormal. Fans of The X-Files generally come in two types. There are those fans who prefer the show's \"mythology episodes,\" episodes which deal with a continuing storyline on The X-Files involving a government conspiracy to conceal the existence of extraterrestrial life. And then there are those fans who prefer The X-Files' \"monster of the week\" episodes, self-contained episodes that focus on non-reoccurring monsters, paranormal phenomena, or villains. I always fell into the latter category of \"monster of the week\" fan, not particularly caring for the mythology episodes. Picking a favourite monster of the week episode is difficult for me as there are so many great ones. That said, the most frightening episode of The X-Files for me may well be \"Home.\"\"Home\" is the second episode of the fourth season of The X-Files, and debuted on October 11 1996 on Fox. \"Home\" takes place in the fictional, small Pennsylvania town of the same name. Mulder and Scully are sent to the small town after a group of kids playing baseball discover the corpse of a severely deformed infant. A conversation with the local sheriff, Andy Taylor (Tucker Smallwood) leads them to the Peacock brothers, who can best be described as mutant hillbillies living well off the grid. There's much more to the episode than that, but the less one knows going into \"Home\" the better.\"Home\" marked the triumphant return of writers Glen Morgan and James Wong to The X-Files. Messrs. Morgan and Wong had worked on The X-Files during its first three seasons before departing to produce their own television show Space: Above and Beyond. After Space: Above and Beyond had been cancelled, they returned to The X-Files. For their first script following their return to the show, they decided to write something that would not only be ambitious, but that would push the envelope for what was allowed on television at the time.Inspiration for \"Home\" came from diverse sources. One was the 1992 documentary Brother's Keeper, which dealt with an alleged murder that occurred in a small farming community near Utica, New York and the Ward brothers, four brothers who lived on a dilapidated farm that had been passed down through their family for generations. Another bit of inspiration came from My Autobiography by Charlie Chaplin, in which he told how he stayed in a miner's tenement home in Wales and was introduced to a legless man who slept in the kitchen cupboard. Two well known movies also served as inspiration for \"Home\": The Texas Chaninsaw Massacre (1974) and The Hills Have Eyes (1977). Yet another source of inspiration came from, of all things, The Andy Griffith Show. Not only is Home, Pennsylvania's sheriff named \"Andy Taylor,\" but the show contains references to Mayberry, the setting of The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D.\"Home\" proved controversial before it even began filming. The producers of The X-Files worried that with \"Home\" the show may have gone too far. Tucker Smallwood, who played Sheriff Andy Taylor, was genuinely shocked by the episode's violence. The episode's director, Kim Manners, wanted to use Johnny Mathis's song \"Wonderful Wonderful\" in the episode, but Mr. Mathis was so appalled after reading the script that he refused to let them use the song. Fortunately, they found a Johnny Mathis soundalike who recorded a cover version for the episode. Kim Manners was the one fan of the script. The director called it \"as classic a horror script I'm ever going to see.\"\"Home\" was shot in Surrey, British Columbia, which is hardly a small town, having a population of over 500,000. Fortunately, Surrey has several buildings of the type often seen in small American (and Canadian, for that matter) towns and they were able to shoot the episode at different angles to give the illusion of a town no bigger than, well, Mayberry, North Carolina.The Fox Network was obviously concerned about \"Home.\" It was the only X-Files episode to carry a TV-MA rating upon its first broadcast. It was also the first X-Files episode to ever bear a viewer discretion warning because of its violent content. While \"Home\" received positive reviews from critics and did very well in the Nielsen ratings, it would be the only episode of The X-Files that Fox never reran. \"Home\" would not be seen again until FX began showing repeats of The X-Files in 1997. In many ways it is understandable why \"Home\" is considered the scariest episode of The X-Files. Its opening scene, in which the Peacock brothers bury the aforementioned deformed baby, is particularly horrifying, Later in the episode there is a good deal of violence that was unusual for most episodes of the series. Even so, The X-Files had featured episodes that were violent both before and after \"Home.\" What makes \"Home\" more disturbing than other X-Files episodes is that it might well hit a little too close to, well, home for many. \"Home\" does not deal with the paranormal or supernatural. The Peacocks are not the products of radiation nor government experiments, nor are they aliens or demons. Instead they are the products of both a highly dysfunctional family and, quite apparently, inbreeding.Unlike the flukeman of \"The Host\" or Tooms in \"Squeeze,\" the Peacocks could actually exist.Beyond the fact that the Peacocks could actually exist, \"Home\" is made all the more disturbing in that it takes aim at traditional American family values. The Peacocks are a nuclear family devoted to their familial traditions and what they view as their family honour. At the same time they are violent, backward, and hostile to outsiders, so much so that their behaviour would be considered dysfunctional by any decent human being. The Peacocks stand in contrast to the small town of Home, with its congenial Sheriff Taylor and the local kids who play baseball there. Although both are products of rural America, Home is the opposite of the Peacock brothers. Home welcomes outsiders and embraces traditional American family values in ways the Peacocks could not conceive. To make a television comparison, the Peacocks are a much more violent, even more dysfunctional Twin Peaks, while Home is Mayberry.Speaking of Mayberry, one of the things that might make \"Home\" all the more terrifying is that it references the archetypal small town, Mayberry from The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D. Its sheriff is named Andy Taylor and his deputy is even named Barney (although his last name is Paster rather than Fife). \"Home\" is also one of the few times a popular song was used in an episode. What is more, \"Wonderful Wonderful\" is used in a scene whose ultraviolence contrasts with the upbeat nature of the song. Yet another pop culture reference may be the name of the Peacock family themselves. Although I cannot verify it, there are those who claim that the name \"Peacock\" was chosen as a slight against rival network NBC, with whom Fox has been engaged in a feud for some time.I won't say that \"Home\" is the best episode of The X-Files. I won't even say it is my absolute favourite, as I never can make up my mind with regards to which episode of The X-Files I like best. That having been said, I can say it is the episode that frightened me the most. It scared me when it first aired and, even today, after repeated viewings it still disturbs me. I have to agree with director Kim Manners, it's as classic a horror episode as anyone is going to see."},

I have to admit that I am disappointed that TCM isn't showing Stand and Deliver (1988) next month. It was produced by American Playhouse, but has been distributed by Warner Bros. since its original release. I am also disappointed that some of Warner Bros.' greatest movies are rather awkwardly scheduled. The Letter (1940) late, late at night (or early, early in the morning, if you prefer)?  King's Row (1940) early Saturday morning? These movies really should be in primetime, in my humble opinion.Here are my picks of what to watch next month. I am including the classic Warner Bros. cartoons, although TCM did not provide the exact time they will air. All times are Central.Saturday, April 1:11:00 AM The Dawn Patrol (1930)11:30 AM Vitaphone Shorts: \"Gus Arnheim and His Cocoanut Grove Orchestra\"(1927), \"Baby Rose Marie: The Child Wonder\" (1929), \"Lambchops\" (1929)Sunday, April 2:12:15 AM The Jazz Singer (1927)5:30 AM Little Caesar (1931)1:00 PM High Sierra (1941)3:00 PM Key Largo (1948) \"Racketeer Rabbit\" (1943) following Key Largo7:00 PM The Public Enemy (1933)\"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" (1950), following The Public EnemyMonday, April 3:7:45 AM The Gold Diggers of 1937 (1936)\"Big House Bunny\" (1950), before Safe in Hell at 7:00 PMTuesday, April 4:4:15 PM Smart Blonde (1937)7:00 PM 42nd Street (1933)9:00 PM Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)10:45 PM Footlight Parade (1933)Wednesday, April 5:5:00 PM Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935)7:00 PM The Sea Wolf (1940)Thursday, April 6:7:30 AM Our Miss Brooks (1957)\"Rabbit Hood\" (1949), right before The Adventures of Robin Hood7:00 PM The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)9:00 PM Life with Father (1947)Friday, April 7:1:15 AM The Letter (1940)1:00 PM The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939)4:30 PM The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936)\"What's Opera, Doc?\" (1957), before They Won't Forget (1937)7:00 PM They Won't Forget (1937)Saturday, April 8:7:30 AM King's Row (1940)3:00 PM The Summer of '42 (1971)7:00 PM Casablanca (1942)Sunday, April 9:8:00 AM Sergeant York (1941)7:00 PM A Star is Born (1954)Monday, April 10: 12:15 PM The Curse of Frankenstein (1957)1:45 PM Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1970)\"Hair Raising Hare\" (1946), in between Hammer movies3:30 PM Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1969)5:15 PM Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970)7:00 PM The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)Tuesday, April 11:9:15 AM Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)5:00 PM The Great Lie (1941)7:00 PM Now, Voyager (1942)9:15 PM Dark Victory (1939)11:15 AM The Strawberry Blonde (1941)Wednesday, April 12:5:15 AM Nora Prentiss (1947)10:15 AM They Made Me a Criminal (1939)7:00 PM White Heat (1951)9:30 PM Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942)Thursday, April 13:1:45 AM The Sea Hawk (1940)8:45 AM They Drive by Night (1940)9:15 PM Sergeant Rutledge (1960)Friday, April 14:4:30 PM A Face in the Crowd (1957)9:00 PM Mister Roberts (1955)11:15 PM Dial M for Murder (1954)Saturday, April 15:1:15 AM House of Wax (1954)4:30 AM Doctor X (1932)6:00 AM The Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933)8:00 AM Them!

It is only one of two times of year, along with fall, when the weather is actually pleasant in Missouri.

{"title": "The 1970-1971 Television Season: When the Networks Tried to Be \"Relevant\"", "date": "Saturday, March 18, 2023", "text": "For the 1970-1971 television season, the broadcast networks' key words were \"youth,\" \"now,\" and \"relevance.\" That season CBS, ABC, and, to a lesser degree, NBC debuted several television shows that starred young casts and dealt with topical, social issues, shows such as The Storefront Lawyers, The Young Lawyers, and The Psychiatrist. This certainly was not because the networks wanted to appear \"relevant\" after years of criticism for airing primarily escapist television. Instead, the networks were hoping that these new shows would attract the key demographic of 18 to 49 year old viewers most valued by Madison Avenue. Despite this, while featuring young casts and dealing with topical issues, most of these shows were designed to have some appeal for the broader television audience in an effort to maximize their ratings. Despite all the networks' ballyhoo about shows that dealt with topical, social issues, in many respects it was nothing new. Shows that touched upon the issues of the day had aired earlier than the 1970-1971 season. In the Fifties it was not unusual for such anthology shows as Studio One and Playhouse 90 to occasionally deal with various hot topics of the time. The Twilight Zone often addressed various social issues and human nature in general. Debuting in 1961, The Defenders ushered in a small cycle of socially conscious television shows, and dealt with such topics as the Civil Rights movement, conscientious objectors, and mercy killing. One of its episodes, \"The Benefactor,\" which addressed abortion, was so controversial the show's regular sponsors (Brown & Williamson, Lever Brothers, and Kimberly-Clark) refused to sponsor it. The Defenders was followed by such socially conscious shows as East Side West Side, Channing, Mr. Novak, and For the People. At the same time as these socially conscious shows were airing, the sketch comedy show That Was the Week That Was, based on the British show of the same name, often dealt with the politics of the day.Even after the socially conscious dramas of the early to mid-Sixties faded away, there were still some shows that would touch upon social issues. From the beginning the Western Bonanza occasionally addressed such issues as racism and mental illness, and this would only increase as the Sixties progressed. At the time Star Trek  was known for addressing social issues through the lens of science fiction.  The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour proved controversial because it insisted on addressing politics and topical issues. Rowan & Martin's Laugh In also addressed politics and topical issues from time to time.In some respects, then, it should have come as no surprise when a spate of shows dealing with socio-political topics in their episodes debuted in the 1970-1971 season. Indeed, it is likely that such shows as The Young Rebels and The Interns owed their existence to one show: The Mod Squad. The Mod Squad centred on three, young undercover detectives (\"one black, one white, one blonde\"). The Mod Squad was one of the earliest shows to deal with the counterculture in a serious manner, and it dealt with such issues as abortion, child abuse, domestic violence, racism, and the Vietnam War. It debuted on September 24 1968 on ABC and proved to be a hit. For its first season it ranked 28 in the Nielsen ratings for the year.The impact of The Mod Squad was felt during the 1969-1970 season, with shows debuting that dealt with the hot topics of the day. Room 222 was a comedy-drama that debuted on ABC on  September 17 1969. It was set at the fictional Walt Whitman High School in Los Angeles, and starred Lloyd Haynes as a young history teacher. From time to time Room 222 dealt with such topics as feminism, homophobia, racism, and the Vietnam War. While Room 222 occasionally dealt with topical issues, they were at the core of the short-lived The New People. The show centred on a group of young people stranded on an island meant for an above-ground nuclear test but never used. The show followed the characters as they attempted to create their own society. Debuting on ABC on September 22 1969, it only lasted until January. While Room 222 and The New People both debuted on ABC, NBC would also debut a show that dealt with socio-political topics in the 1969-1970 season. Airing on NBC, The Bold Ones was an umbrella title for four rotating shows. When one of the original shows, The Protectors, was cancelled, it was replaced by a show called The Senator, starring Hal Holbrook as a United States Senator from an unnamed state. Because of its very nature, The Senator often addressed social issues, including air pollution, anti-war protests, and the welfare system. In addition to Room 222, The New People, and The Senator, two medical dramas debuted during the 1969-1970 season that occasionally touched upon social issues, Marcus Welby, M.D. (on ABC) and Medical Center (on CBS).The first of the shows featuring young casts and dealing with social issues to debut in the 1970-1971 season was Storefront Lawyers. Storefront Lawyers debuted on CBS on September 16 1970. The show starred Robert Foxworth as a young lawyer, David Hansen, who leaves a prestigious law firm to found a non-profit called  Neighborhood Legal Services. Working with him were Deborah Sullivan (Sheila Larken) and Gabriel Kay (David Arkin). A legal student, Robeto Alvarez (A. Martinez) worked as their law clerk. Storefront Lawyers differed from The Mod Squad (and most of the other new, socially conscious shows that season) in that it lacked an older character who acted as a father figure. Set in Century City, Storefront Lawyers dealt with such issues as domestic violence, affirmative action, racism, and illiteracy. Storefront Lawyers received mixed reviews, with the majority tending to be negative. Worse yet, the show did not perform particularly well in the ratings. CBS then revamped the show as Men at Law, in which David Hansen returns to his old law firm. It did no better in the ratings, and was cancelled at the end of the season. Curiously, while Storefront Lawyers was meant to appeal to a younger demographic, according to the book Archie Bunker's America: TV in an Era of Change, 1968-1978, its \"strongest audience\" was \"those over fifty.\"The second new, socially \"relevant\" show of the 1970-1971 season also debuted on CBS. The Interns was a medical drama loosely based on the 1962 film The Interns and its 1964 sequel The New Interns, which were in turn based on the novel The Interns by Robert Frede. Despite this, The Interns shared no characters in common with the two movies or the novel, although it was set in the same hospital as the movies, New North Hospital in Los Angeles. While inspired by the movie The Interns, the show owed a good deal to The Mod Squad. Like the young characters on The Mod Squad, the young characters on The Interns reported to a father figure--in the case of The Interns, Dr. Peter Goldstone (Broderick Crawford). Of the five interns on the show, one was a woman, Dr. Lydia Thorpe (Sandra Smith). Another was Black, Cal Barrin (Hal Fredrick). Yet another was married. Dr. Sam Marsh was played by Mike Farrel, now best known for M*A*S*H, while his wife, Bobbe Marsh, was played by Elaine Giftos. The remaining interns were Greg Pettit (Stephen Brooks) and Pooch Hardin (Christopher Stone). For a show meant to appeal to a young demographic, CBS scheduled the show at a time when it was likely they would not be watching television. It debuted on Friday, September 19 1970 at 7:30 PM Central/6:30 PM Central. It is perhaps for that reason it did not do very well in the ratings. Its first episode ranked 45th out of the 80 shows on the air, and the ratings did not improve from there.  The Interns received largely negative reviews from critics. Jack Gould of The New York Times described it as \"one more hospital drama of scant distinction.\" From descriptions of The Interns, it would appear to be an uncomfortable blend of medical soap opera and social relevance. Not only did episodes deal with racism, abortion, riots, drugs, and mental illness, but one of the doctors was in a serious car accident, another doctor was accused of having an affair with a woman by her husband, another doctor was accused of murder, and most of them appear to have been sued at some point. The Interns would not survive the 1970-1971 season.The Interns was immediately followed by the next new show to deal with social issues. Headmaster (also known as The Headmaster) debuted on CBS on September 19 1970 at 8:30 PM. Headmaster was unusual among the socially \"relevant\" shows to debut in the 1970-1971 season in that its regular cast was all over 30. Headmaster starred Andy Griffith as Andy Thompson, the headmaster of Concord School, a small private school in California. His wife, Margaret (Claudette Nevins), also worked at the school as an English teacher. Jerry Van Dyke was the school's football coach, Jerry Brownell, while Parker Fennelly was the school's custodian, Mr. Purdy. Despite the casting of Andy Griffith and Jerry Van Dyke, Headmaster was not a sitcom, but a comedy drama. Indeed, it was a sharp contrast to The Andy Griffith Show.  Its first episode guest starred Butch Patrick (best known as Eddie Munster on The Munsters) as a student who succumbs to peer pressure to do drugs. Despite starring Andy Griffith, Headmaster dealt with the issues of the day.If CBS was hoping that Headmaster would be Andy Griffith's triumphant return to television, they would be sorely disappointed. Headmaster was lambasted by the critics. In no less than The New York Times it was referred to as \"Modern TV waste.\" Audiences apparently did not care for Headmaster either. In the beginning, probably on the strength of Andy Griffith alone, its first episode ranked 20th out of the 80 shows on the air for the week. In its second week it dropped all the way to 38th for the week. After that, its ratings got even worse. With it clear that Headmaster was a failure, it was replaced in its timeslot by another show starring Andy Griffith. The New Andy Griffith Show was a more traditional rural comedy much like The Andy Griffith Show.While CBS's new socially relevant shows did not receive sterling reviews, none of them were met with as hostile a reaction from critics as The Young Rebels. Debuting on ABC on September 20 1970, it may have received the worst reviews of any show debuting that season. The Young Rebels was set during the Revolutionary War and centred around a group of young guerillas known as the Yankee Doodle Society. It starred Richard Ely as Jeremy Larkin, leader of the Yankee Doodle Society; Louis Gossett Jr. as Isak Poole, a former slave turned blacksmith; and Alex Henteloff as Henry Abington, who developed explosives and various devices with which to fight the British. They were often aided by the young he Marquis de Lafayette, played by Philippe Forquet. Despite being counted among the youthful, socially relevant shows of the time and being an obvious attempt by ABC to appear socially relevant, only the first episode of The Young Rebels acknowledged contemporary social issues (in that case, protests by the youth). Afterwards the show became essentially another family action show, closer in spirit to Daniel Boone than The Mod Squad. Regardless, critics were largely hostile to The Young Rebels at worst and indifferent to it at best. Viewers were not impressed, and The Young Rebels suffered from low ratings. Of course, this might have been the case even if it was a quality show. It was scheduled against extremely popular family shows, Wild Kingdom and the first half of The Wonderful World of Disney on NBC and Lassie on CBS. The Young Rebels ended its run after only 15 episodes.The Young Lawyers, debuting the next night, Monday, September 21 1970, fared somewhat better than The Young Rebels. The Young Lawyers was patterned somewhat after The Mod Squad. Its title was also somewhat inaccurate, as its young protagonists were only legal students rather than full-fledged lawyers. The Young Lawyers starred Zalman King as Aaron Silverman, a legal student who opens the Neighborhood Law Office, a centre for legal aid. Joining him was fellow legal student Pat Walters (Judy Pace). They were assisted by lawyer David Barett (Lee J. Cobb). A new character, Chris Blake (Phillip Clark) was introduced to the show at mid-season. In hopes of higher ratings, ABC wanted changes made to The Young Lawyers, including toning down the socially conscious stories and the introduction of a WASP character (Aaron Silverman was Jewish and Pat Waters was Black). The changes did not sit well with writer Stephen Kandel, who named the new WASP character \"Christian White,\" according to fellow writer Harlan Ellison. Stephen Kandel's script would go through several drafts before ABC's censors caught on and insisted the name be changed. Unlike some of the relevance shows of the 1970-1971 season, The Young Lawyers received somewhat respectable reviews. The critics' general opinion of The Young Lawyers may best be summed up by Rick Du Brow of UPI, who wrote of the series, \"..the show, while nothing great, has a rather nice feel to it.\" Unfortunately, The Young Lawyers would not do well in the ratings, probably because ABC scheduled it in the worst possible time slot. In the Eastern and Central time zones, it aired immediately before Monday Night Football (then in its first season)  at 7:30 PM Eastern/6:30 PM Central. To make matters worse, in the Eastern and Central time zones it faced stiff competition in the form of Gunsmoke on CBS and the first half of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In on NBC. On the West Coast it aired after Monday Night Football at 8:45 PM Pacific. There it faced Mayberry R.F.D. and The Doris Day Show on CBS and the first part of NBC Monday Night at the Movies on NBC. The end result is that The Young Lawyers did very badly in the ratings. It lasted the entire season, but it would not get a second season.ABC's next relevance show to debut starred a familiar face to television viewers. Then as now, Vince Edwards was best known as Ben Casey. It was on March 8 1970 that the TV movie Dial Hot Line aired on ABC Movie of the Week. It starred Vince Edwards as social worker David Leopold, who was in charge of a crisis hot line. The TV movie would inspire the series Matt Lincoln, although several changes would be made from the television movie. The character David Leopold was renamed \"Matt Lincoln\" and he was a psychiatrist rather than a social worker. In addition to the crisis hot line, Dr. Lincoln also operated a free walk-in clinic. In the TV movie David Leopold was assisted by Tag (Chelsea Brown), Jimmy (Felton Perry), and Ann (June Harding). who were retained in the TV series Matt Lincoln as Dr. Lincoln's assistants. On the television series further help came in the form of  Matt Lincoln's father, Dr. Matthew Lincoln, Sr. (Dean Jagger). The series covered such issues as heroin addiction, pollution, and alcoholism, among others. While Ben Casey had proven to be a smash hit in the Sixties, lightning would not strike twice for Vince Edwards. Matt Lincoln had the misfortune of airing against Family Affair and the first half of The Jim Nabors Hour on CBS and the smash hit of the 1970-1971 season, The Flip Wilson Show, on NBC. It only managed to last half a season, ending its run on January 14 1971. It was replaced by the Western Alias Smith and Jones.Unlike ABC and CBS, during the 1970-1971 season NBC did not invest heavily in relevance shows. Its only new show during the season to deal with social issues was The Psychiatrist. Even then it did not air the whole season. The Psychiatrist was one of four shows that aired under the umbrella title Four In One. Four in One differed from other umbrella titles, such as The Bold Ones and The NBC Mystery Movie in that its shows were not rotated weekly. Instead, the entire run of a show would be aired over several weeks before going onto the next show. The Psychiatrist was the last of the four shows to air on Four In One. The Psychiatrist starred Roy Thinnes as Dr. James Whitman, a psychiatrist who often used unusual methods to help his patients. Luther Adler played Dr. Bernard Altman, with whom Dr. Whitman worked. During its run of six episodes, The Psychiatrist dealt with such issues as drug addiction, abortion, and racism. The Psychiatrist received largely positive reactions from critics, but the umbrella title Four In One did not fair particularly well in the ratings. Much of this may have been due to its competition on CBS, the high-rated Hawaii Five-O. The Psychiatrist, along with another show that aired under the umbrella series, San Francisco International Airport, would not see another season. McCloud would join NBC's brand new umbrella title, NBC Mystery Movie, the following season. Night Gallery would be spun off as its own series. While \"relevance\" was among the broadcast networks' key words at the start of the 1970-1971 season, by the end of the season every single one of the relevance dramas were cancelled. As television journalist Les Brown remarked in his 1971 book Televi$ion: The Business Behind the Box, \"Relevance may have been the shortest program cycle in the history of the medium.\" While the broadcast networks (particularly CBS and ABC) were wrong about youth-oriented, relevant dramas being the wave of the future, they were right about one thing. Relevance would play a role in television in the Seventies. It was on January 12 1971 that the sitcom All in the Family debuted. The show dealt with such issues as racism, the Vietnam War, antisemitism, homosexuality, feminism, and so on. As a mid-season replacement CBS did not have high expectations for the show, and it initially received ratings low enough to warrant cancellation. Fortunately the show received seven Emmy nominations, which probably saved it from the chopping block. The following season it would become the no. 1 show on the air.  All in the Family would be followed by other socially relevant sitcoms, such as Maude and Good Times. The youth oriented dramas dealing with social issues may have failed, but All in the Family insured relevance would still have a place on American television.As to why the youth oriented, relevant dramas failed, much of it may have been because many of them were not very good. With a few exceptions (The Young Lawyers, The Psychiatrist) most of the shows did not get good reviews. In most cases the various shows were nothing new, featuring the same old, tired storylines with socially relevant angles grafted onto them. Indeed, most of the shows belonged to already established television genres, such as medical dramas (The Interns, Matt Lincoln) and legal dramas (Storefront Lawyers, The Young Lawyers). Even The Young Rebels, set during the Revolutionary War, fit in quite nicely with previous frontier dramas and Westerns. Making matters worse, there was a sameness about many of the shows because they were obviously patterned after The Mod Squad: a small group of young people (at least one of who was usually Black and another a woman) with an older father figure to serve as guidance.Of course, much of the reason the socially relevant dramas of the 1970-1971 failed was also bad scheduling. The vast majority of the shows were placed in the 7:30 PM Eastern/6:30 PM Central time slot, a time when the conventional wisdom is that children have control of the television set. I rather doubt kids in 1970-1971 were much interested in watching Storefront Lawyers or The Interns. This scheduling also somewhat limited the shows in how they dealt with their subject matter. With children possibly watching, there were many topics with which they could not deal in a matter befitting the seriousness of the subject. Even when a show was recognized by critics as being of some quality, such as The Young Lawyers, it was done in by poor scheduling.While the youth oriented, relevant shows of the 1970-1971 season failed, they would have a lasting impact on television in the Seventies. It wasn't simply sitcoms such as All in the Family and Maude that dealt with social issues. Medical shows such as Marcus Welby, M.D. and Medical Center would continue to do so. Such diverse dramas as The Waltons, Bonanza, Little House on the Prairie, Kojak, and Lou Grant dealt with such topics as racism, drug addiction, feminism, and so on. Since the Seventies various television shows have touched upon social issues from time to time. The youth oriented, socially relevant shows of the 1970-1971 might have been failures in the ratings, but they proved to have a lasting impact after all."},

{"title": "The Problem with Warner Bros.' 100th Anniversary Video", "date": "Thursday, March 16, 2023", "text": "Warner Bros. may well have been the first studio from the Golden Age of Hollywood of which I was aware. After all, the Warner Bros. shield was prominently featured before all of the classic Warner Bros. cartoons I watched voraciously as a kid. Later I would discover their classic television shows in reruns, from Maverick to 77 Sunset Strip to F Troop. It was only a little bit later that I discovered their classic films, including The Maltese Falcon (1941), Casablanca (1942), Now, Voyager (1942), and Mildred Pierce (1945) on local television stations. Many of my favourite stars were signed to Warner Bros., including Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, James Cagney, and Edward G. Robinson. If I had to name my favourite movie studio of all time, it might well be Warner Bros.It is because of that I have been eagerly awaiting Warner Bros.' 100th anniversary on April 4. It was in December that Warner Bros. dropped a video in tribute to their 100th anniversary. As it turned out, the video was not eagerly embraced by classic film buffs, myself included. The Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary video was shown during this past Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony, where it was once more met with a less than favourable reaction from classic film buffs. The problem? It includes clips from movies that were originally neither produced nor even distributed by Warner Bros.Indeed, many of the films prominently featured in the video were produced not by Warner Bros., but their archrival MGM. The Wizard of Oz (1939), North by Northwest (1959), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Ben-Hur (1959), An American in Paris (1941), and A Christmas Story (1983) were all produced by Metro-Golwyn-Mayer. Gone with the Wind (1939) was produced by Selznick International Pictures in association with MGM. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) was produced by Wolper Pictures and distributed by Paramount.Now all of these films are now owned by Warner Bros. It was in 1986 that Ted Turner bought MGM/UA Entertainment Co. from Kirk Kerokian. He almost immediately sold it back to Mr. Kerokian, but he kept the pre-1986 MGM/UA film and television library. It was with the MGM/UA library and other libraries that Ted Turner formed Turner Entertainment Co. in 1986. It was in 1996 that Turner Entertainment Co. was acquired by Time Warner. The end result of this is that Warner  has control of the pre-MGM library. Quite simply, Warner owns The Wizard of Oz, 2002: A Space Odyssey, and other movies made by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer. As to Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, it was in 1977 that Paramount declined to renew the distribution rights for the film. The rights then defaulted to Quaker Oats Company, who were involved in the production of the film. Quaker Oats Company then sold Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory to Warner Bros.Movies neither originally produced nor distributed by Warner Bros. being featured in the 100th Anniversary video would not be so bad if it were not for the fact that many prominent classic films that were produced and distributed by Warner Bros. are nowhere to be seen in the video. Such Warner Bros. classics as Little Caesar (1931), Stella Dallas (1937), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942), Kings Row (1942), Now, Voyager (1942), Arsenic and Old Lace (1944),and Christmas in Connecticut (1944), among others, are nowhere to be seen.Of course, in omitting many of Warner Bros.' classic films from the video, they also omitted almost all of their classic stars. Humphrey Bogart is the only one featured prominently in the video. Absent from the video are Bette Davis, James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, Errol Flynn, Mary Astor, Joan Fontaine, and many others. Going by the video, Warner Bros. would apparently have you believe that George Clooney is more important to film history than Bette Davis.Warner Bros. not only gave short shrift to their contract players from the Golden Age of Hollywood, but even the classic cartoon characters for which they may be best known. There is only one clip from a classic Warner Bros. cartoon and another from Space Jam (1996). Given that the classic Warner Bros. cartoons is how many of us were introduced to the studio, one would think they would have included several clips from the classic cartoons. One would think they would not only highlight Bugs Bunny, but Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig, and maybe a few other of their classic cartoon characters.As if omitting many of Warner Bros.' classic feature films and animated shorts in favour of movies produced by other studios wasn't bad enough, Warner Bros. also largely ignored its classic television shows. The classic Wonder Woman, starring Lynda Carter, is the oldest Warner Bros. show featured in the video. Missing are such classics as Maverick, 77 Sunset Strip, F Troop, The F.B.I., The Streets of San Francisco, and Kung Fu. While I appreciate that clips from ER found their way into the video, Warner Bros. effectively ignored three decades worth of television shows. Indeed, watching the video one would think Friends was Warner Bros.' greatest contribution to TV. history I hate to inform Warner Bros., but I think people will still be watching Maverick long after Friends has been forgotten.Now I do appreciate that Warner Bros. highlighted the contribution that DC Comics has made to the company (DC Comics was bought by Kinney National Company in 1967, who then bought Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in 1969). I also appreciate that they featured a clip from Stand and Deliver (1988--although produced by American Playhouse, it was distributed by Warner Bros.). I do think that Warner Bros. genuinely meant for the video to be a celebration of the studio's history. The problem is that in some ways it plays more like a celebration of MGM's history.As a fan of Warner Bros. since childhood, what I wanted to see in this video was a real tribute to the studio. I wanted to see clips from the many classic movies they produced and/or distributed. I wanted to see clips from The Adventures of Robin Hood and High Sierra. I wanted to see clips from such classic cartoons as \"What's Opera, Doc?\" and \"One Froggy Evening.\" I wanted to see clips from such TV shows as Maverick and 77 Sunset Strip. I wanted to see clips from Warner Bros.' history. As much as I love The Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, they are only movies that Warner Bros. currently owns, and as such are not a major part of the studio's history. Warner Bros. did not produce them and did not originally distribute them. Indeed, while I think Louis B. Mayer would probably get a big laugh out of the video, I think Jack Warner (and probably the other Warner brothers as well) would be furious. Honestly, I think Warner Bros. should create another video that truly acknowledges the studio's history. This one really doesn't."},
{"title": "The Academy Needs to Get the Oscars On-Air In Memoriam Right", "date": "Tuesday, March 14, 2023", "text": "The 95th Academy Awards were held this past Sunday and, as usual, film buffs are divided on whether it was good or not. Everyone seems to agree upon one thing though, that the on-air In Memoriam segment left a lot to be desired. Quite simply, it omitted far too many people, including many that one would have thought would have been guaranteed to have been included the In Memoriam.Indeed, legendary actress Marsha Hunt, who appeared in Pride and Prejudice (1940) and Raw Deal (1948), did not make the cut. Robert Morse had a career on stage, in television, and in film. He appeared in such movies as The Loved One (1965) and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1967). Despite this, he did not appear in the In Memoriam. Paul Sorvino had a career that spanned over fifty years and appeared in such films as The Brinks Job (1978), Goodfellas (1990), and The Rocketeer (1991). Apparently this was not enough to warrant being included in the In Memoriam. Cindy Williams was best known for television's Laverne & Shirley, but she appeared in movies as well, including the classics American Graffiti (1973) and The Conversation (1974). This wasn't enough for her to be included in the In Memoriam. The list of individuals who were excluded from the 95th Academy Awards' In Memoriam segment is not a short one. Among others, Ricou Browning, Pat Carroll, Kevin Conroy, Carole Cook, Melinda Dillon, Bert I. Gordon, Gilbert Gottried, Anne Heche, Marsha Hunt, Leslie Jordan, Yvette Mimieux, Stella Stevens, Topol, and Fred Ward were all omitted. I am sure there were others which I might have missed, for which I apologize.The In Memoriam segment of this Sunday's Oscars was met with anger from film buffs almost immediately, and in one instance the family of one of those omitted. Dee Dee Sorvino, widow of Paul Sorvino was upset that he was omitted from the In Memoriam, and even demanded an apology that he was left out. His daughter Mira Sorvino said she was \"hurt and shocked\" that her father was left out of the In Memoriam and also said, \"It is baffling beyond belief that my beloved father and many other amazing brilliant departed actors were left out.\" I can fully sympathize with both Dee Dee Sorvino and Mira Sorvino's pain at Paul Sorvino being omitted from the In Memoriam.It was in 2019 that my dearest friend Vanessa Marquez was omitted from the on-air In Memoriam segment, despite a petition demanding her inclusion that reached over 12,000 signatures, as well as letters, at least one from an Academy member, asking that she be included. To say that I was angry and hurt would be an understatement. I am still angry and hurt. Of course, The Academy has omitted bigger names than Vanessa both before and since 2019. Believe it or not, over the years such legends as James Arness, Michael Gough, Andy Griffith, Ann Rutherford, Robert Vaughn, Barbara Hale, Adam West, Stanley Donen, Abe Vigoda, Aretha Franklin, Julie Adams, Honor Blackman, Adam Schlesinger, Ed Asner, and Michael Nesmith have been omitted from the In Memoriam segment, Here I must stress that this is a short list. A list of every single well known actor, director, writer, and composer omitted from the Oscars on-air In Memoriam would be much, much longer. Now in past years the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has included a more comprehensive In Memoriam on the website (in 2019 Vanessa was included in this). And this year they had a QR code on the screen which one could scan to their phone and be taken to a place where they could watch a longer, more inclusive In Memoriam video. The problem I have with both of these is that it is not the same as being featured in the In Memoriam segment aired during the ceremony. As both a fan of many omitted from the In Memoriam over the years and the close friend of one of those omitted, I can safely say that we want to see our favourites honoured during the broadcast. Of course, as much as film buffs might want to blame the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the many omissions in the In Memoriam segment over the years, they are not the only ones to blame. ABC is also a culprit. For years ABC has insisted that the Oscars ceremony be shorter, this despite the fact that the one thing that film buffs have never complained about is the length of the ceremony. Indeed, it was ABC who insisted that the Academy cut eight categories from the ceremony last year, angering both the industry and film buffs.  Because ABC insists that the ceremony be shorter, I have no doubt that the Academy feels it has to keep the In Memoriam segment as brief as possible. I have two thoughts about this. First, the Academy Awards ceremony is the Super Bowl for film buffs. If ABC had the Super Bowl, I have to suspect that they would not insist the game be shorter. In insisting that the ceremony be shorter, ABC is then showing disrespect to the Oscars' core audience. Second, if the Academy feels it has to cut time somewhere, the In Memoriam segment is not the place to do it. The In Memoriam should be of such a length that it includes every single artist who has died in the past year. TCM Remembers runs about four to five minutes and manages to include nearly everyone, although honestly I wouldn't mind if the Oscars In Memoriam ran ten minutes. ABC needs to realize that the core audience for the Oscars are film buffs and we don't care how long the ceremony is and we don't care how long the In Memoriam is. In fact, we'd prefer a longer In Memoriam segment that includes everyone to a shorter one that omits beloved stars, Indeed, people have been complaining about omissions in the In Memoriam segment for literally years. The very fact that her Stand and Deliver (1988) co-star Lydia Nicole felt the need to create a petition to include Vanessa in the on-air Oscars In Memoriam shows how badly the Academy has been omitting individuals from the segment. In the end, both ABC and the Academy of Motion Arts and Sciences should realize that the In Memoriam segment is not for the Academy's members and it certainly isn't for the broadcast network. It is for the fans and loved ones of those who have died in the past year. It is an opportunity for film buffs to say goodbye to the stars they love. To omit beloved stars is not only an insult to those stars, but an insult to their fans and loved ones as well. ABC and the Academy need to start treating the In Memoriam segment with the seriousness it deserves."},
{"title": "Academy Awards 2023", "date": "Monday, March 13, 2023", "text": "Last year was the first year in decades that I did not watch the Academy Awards. Under pressure from ABC, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences cut eight categories (Sound, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score, Production Design, Documentary Short, Animated Short, and Live Action Short) from the live ceremony. This was the final straw for me, after years of the Academy omitting beloved stars from the on-air In Memoriam, including my dearest Vanessa Marquez despite a petition to include her with thousands of signatures. This year the Academy restored the eight categories to the live ceremony, so I decided to watch, even though I knew I would probably be angered by the In Memoriam (more on that in a bit).For the most part I enjoyed this year's Academy Awards ceremony, although I thought Jimmy Kimmel, who is usually quite funny, was unfunny for the most part. Indeed, some of his remarks were simply clueless. He acknowledged the return of eight categories to the live ceremony, which he attributed to protests from the film industry. In actuality, I think film buffs protested more than the film industry and many, like me, boycotted the ceremony last year because those categories were cut. Worse yet, Jimmy Kimmel began joking about the length of the ceremony before even an hour had passed. I think I can speak for many film buffs when I say that we really don't care how long the ceremony is and we have largely resented ABC and the Academy's attempts to make it shorter. Perhaps the low point for Mr. Kimmel was when he made a \"joke\" about Robert Blake being excluded or included from the In Memoriam. I personally thought the remark was both insensitive and in poor taste. Regardless of what Robert Blake may or may not have done, his death is very recent. His family is still grieving. I hate to think how his family felt hearing that \"joke.\"Fortunately, last night's presenters were much better than Jimmy Kimmel was. A lot of love was given to the craft categories, I am guessing because the Academy cut them from the live ceremony last year. Perhaps the most entertaining of the presenters was director Elizabeth Banks. Having directed the movie Cocaine Bear (2023), she presented the award for Visual Effects alongside a person in a bear suit. Never mind that the situation was funny in and of itself, Miss Banks was funny herself. Honestly, I wouldn't mind if she hosted the Oscars next year.The acceptance speeches on last night's Oscars were also quite good. Ke Huy Quan, who won Best Supporting Actor for Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022), gave a very touching speech, and  noted that his mother was watching at home. He held up his Oscar, saying \"Mom, I just won an Oscar!\" Jamie Lee Curtis, who won Best Supporting Actress for Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022), praised the fans of her genre movies and remarked \"We just won an Oscar.\" Both Brendan Fraser (who won for Best Actor for The Whale) and Michelle Yeoh (who won Best Actress for Everything Everywhere All at Once) both gave very touching speeches. Here I have to point out that Michelle Yeoh's win last night was historic. She is the first woman of Asian descent to ever win the Oscar for Best Actress. When compared to last year, the In Memoriam segment was much better staged. with Lenny Kravitz performing his song \"Calling All Angels.\" Unfortunately, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences seem to have omitted more beloved actors and actresses this year than ever. Among the most glaring omissions was Paul Sorvino, whose career spanned over fifty years. Many of his fans (including myself) were not happy with the Academy for omitting him. Both his daughter Mira Sorvino and his widow Dee Sorvino have made their disappointment in the Academy clear. One would think if anyone would be included in the In Memoriam, it would be Paul Sorvino. Also omitted was Cindy Williams. While she may be best known for the TV series Laverne & Shirley, she appeared in several movies, including the classics  American Graffiti (1973) and The Conversation (1974). Several others were omitted from the In Memoriam, so many I don't think I can name them all. I apologize in advance for missing anyone. Anyway, also omitted from the In Memoriam were Ricou Browning, Pat Carroll, Kevin Conroy, Carole Cook, Melinda Dillon, Bert I. Gordon, Gilbert Gottried, Anne Heche, Marsha Hunt, Leslie Jordan, Yvette Mimieux, Robert Morse, Stella Stevens, Topol, and Fred Ward.The omissions of Paul Sorvino and Cindy Williams particularly anger me, and having had someone I love omitted from the Oscars in the past I can fully sympathize with their families and friends. What the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should realize is that the In Memoriam isn't simply for the Academy, it is for the families, friends, and even fans of those who have passed. When I watch the In Memoriam on the Oscars, I want to see very single actor, actress, director, et. al. that I admire who has died. I am really not concerned with how long the In Memoriam is, and I don't think anyone except ABC and the Academy are. Aside from the omissions from the In Memoriam, one other thing angered me at last night's ceremony. The orchestra played off several winners before they could even begin to complete their acceptance speeches. Indeed, Judy Chin, one of the winners of the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling for The Whale (2022), just got up to the mic when she was played off. Her co-winner, Annemarie Bradley didn't get to say anything. Speaking as someone who has watched the majority of Academy Awards ceremonies for the past forty years, I am really not worried about how long acceptance speeches are. In fact, I want to hear them. I was then disappointed that Miss Chin and others were played off before they could say anything.Here I hope I don't sound overly negative. For the most part I enjoyed last night's ceremony. That having been said, the Academy has quite a bit of room for improvement. They really should make sure that whoever they get to host is actually funny, and knows and understand the fans watching at home. They shouldn't be joking about how long the ceremony is or making tasteless jokes about someone who has recently died. The In Memoriam should be longer and more inclusive. I really don't care if it runs 10 minutes, as long as it includes every star I love who has died.. When someone as famous and beloved as Paul Sorvino has died, make certain to include him in the In Memoriam. Winners should be allowed to make their acceptance speeches without fear of being played off. And, finally, don't worry about how long the ceremony is. I think I can speak for most film buffs when I say we don't care how long it. This is our Super Bowl. Treat it as such."},
{"title": "The Late Great Topol", "date": "Saturday, March 11, 2023", "text": "Topol, who played milkman Tevye in both the stage and film versions of Fiddler on the Roof (1971) and Dr. Hans Zarkov in the movie Flash Gordon (1980), died on March 8 2023 at the age of 87 after a long illness.Chaim Topol was born on September 9 1935 in Tel Aviv, Mandatory Palestine. It was his elementary teacher, acclaimed children's author Yemima Avidar-Tchernovitz, who discovered his theatrical side and encouraged him to pursue the performing arts. As a teenager he worked at the newspaper Davar while taking high school classes at night. After graduating high school he lived in Kibbutz Geva. Afterwards he enlisted in the Israeli army, where he became a member of the Nahal entertainment troupe. Once his service was over, Topol performed throughout Israel with a kibbutz theatre group founded by he and his friends in 1957. It was in 1964 that Topol made his film debut in I Like Mike in 1961. In the Sixties he appeared in the movies El Dorado (1963), Sallah Shabati (1964), Cast a Giant Shadow (1966), Ervinka (1967), and Before Winter Comes (1968). It was in 1966 that he first played Tevye the Dairyman in the Israeli production of Fiddler on the Roof. In 1967 he played the role on the West End of London. He would play the role several more times in his career.In the Seventies Topol produced the Broadway play Ipi-Tombi. He appeared in the films Ha-Tarnegol (1971), Fiddler on the Roof (1971), Follow Me (1972), A Talent for Loving (1973), Galileo (1975), and Flash Gordon (1980). In the Eighties he appeared on television in the mini-series The Winds of War, Queenie, and War and Remembrance. He guest starred on the show Tales of Remembrance. He appeared in the movies For Your Eyes Only (1981) and Roman Behemshechim (1985). He reprised his role as Tevye in a West End production of Fiddler on the Roof and a touring production of the musical in the United States.In the Nineties he appeared several times in Fiddler on the Roof, on Broadway, in a touring production in the United States, and at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne. He guest starred on the show SeaQuest DSV and appeared in the film Left Luggage (1998). He continued to appear in productions of Fiddler on the Roof in the Naughts. Topol also illustrated several books in both Hebrew and English, and produced drawings of important Israeli figures. He wrote his autobiography, Topol on Topol, and the books To Life! and Topol's Treasury of Jewish Humour.Topol was an incredible talent. He was a relatively young man when he played Tevye in the Sixties and in the 1971 film version, but he was utterly convincing as the middle-aged milkman. What is more he was versatile. The eccentric Dr. Zarkov in Flash Gordon (1980) couldn't have been more different from Tevye. He was also convincing as the legendary scientist Galileo Galilei in Galileo (1975). In Follow Me (1972), he played detective Julian Cristoforou, who refuses to give up on a case even after the person he is tailing realizes he is doing so. While there can be no doubt that Topol will be best remembered as Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof, he played a wide variety of roles in his career and gave great performances in all of them."},
{"title": "The 25th Anniversary of Netflix Sending Out Its First DVD", "date": "Friday, March 10, 2023", "text": "Today is my birthday. It was also on March 10 1998 that Netflix sent out its first DVD. For those of you who think of Netflix as a streaming service, it originated as a company that rented DVDs through the mail. It was a good time for such a company. DVD player ownership was growing in the late Nineties and would continue to do so in the Naughts. Netflix was founded on August 29 1997 by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings. As mentioned above, it sent out its first DVD on March 10 1998. As to what that DVD was, it was Beetlejuice (1998). The person who rented that first historic DVD is unknown. It was in 1999 that Netflix introduced monthly subscriptions, whereby one could rent several DVDs for a low monthly fee. Netflix grew very quickly in the Naughts. By February 2007 it had sent out its billionth DVD (the movie Babel from 2006). It was also in 2007 that Netflix launched its streaming service. In fact, it was announced on January 15. Originally, if one was subscribed to the DVD service, then one was also subscribed to the streaming service. This changed in the mid-Teens, when the two services were finally separated, although both retained the Netflix name. Netflix still sends DVDs through the mail, through their site DVD.com. While I no longer subscribe to Netflix's DVD service, I was a subscriber for well over a decade. Through its DVD service I was able to watch the entire run of the obscure TVseries Nowhere Man and re-watch the TV series Crime Story. I am not sure how many movies I discovered through Netflix, but it was quite a few. There are those who keep announcing the death of physical media, although I personally think such pronouncements are greatly exaggerated. Aside from myself, I know many who still use physical media. In fact, if I made more money I would probably still subscribe to Netflix DVD. The plain fact is that any streaming service is somewhat limited in what it has to offer, but Netflix DVD still has thousands of DVDs available. What is more, while most streaming services will offer only mainstream movies, one can get very obscure movies through Netflix DVD. It is then my hope that Netflix will still continue sending out DVDs for another 25 years and more."},

Gordon, nicknamed \"Mr. B.I.G.\" by sci-fi legend Forrest Ackerman both due to his initials and the frequent subject matter of his movies, died on March 8 2023 at the age of 100. Throughout his career he produced, wrote, and directed such low-budget sci-fi films as The Amazing Colossal Man (1957) and Earth vs. the Spider (1958).Bert I. Gordon was born on September 24 2022 in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He was given his first camera when he was only nine years old and became fascinated with visual effects. His aunt gave him a 16mm movie camera when he was 13 and he was soon making his own amateur films. He served in the Army Air Forces during World War II. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin.Bert I. Gordon made television commercials before producing the movie Serpent Island (1954). The first film produced, written, and directed by Bert I. Gordon was King Dinosaur (1955). The film only had a budget of $18,000 and its \"dinosaur\" was merely an iguana. In the Fifties Bert I. Gordon would produce, write, and direct other low budget movies, including Beginning of the End (1957), The Cyclops (1957), The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), Attack of the Puppet People (1958), War of the Colossal Beast (1958), Earth vs. the Spider (1958), The Boy and the Pirates (1960), and Tormented (1960).The Sixties saw Bert I. Gordon produce and direct two television pilots: Famous Ghost Stories and Take Me to Your Leader. He made the movies The Magic Sword (1962), Village of the Giants (1965), Picture Mommy Dead (1966), and How to Succeed with Sex (1970). In the Seventies he made the movies Necromancy (1972), The Mad Bomber (1973), The Food of the Gods (1976), and Empire of the Ants (1977). In the Eighties he made the films Burned at the Stake (1982), Let's Do It! (1982), The Big Bet (1987), and Satan's Princess (1989). His final film was Secrets of a Psychopath in 2015. Many directors are called \"auteurs,\" but Bert I. Gordon truly was one. He not only produce, directed, and often wrote his movies, but he even provided the special effects on many of them. What is more, his movies were often a family affair. His wife Flora often helped him with the visual effects. His daughter, actress Susan Gordon, appeared in this films Attack of the Puppet People (1958), The Boy and the Pirates (1960), Tormented (1960), and Picture Mommy Dead (1966). Although he was best known for his giant animal movies, Bert I. Gordon actually directed movies in a variety of genres, including supernatural horror, fantasy, psychological thriller, action, and even sex comedy. What is more, he was responsive to trend. In the Fifties, when the fear of nuclear annihilation resulted in a slough of movies about giant monsters, he made movies featuring oversized critters. In the Sixties, when fantasy movies were popular he directed The Magic Sword. The Seventies saw Satanic horror and action movies were all the rage, he directed the films Necromancy and The Mad Bomber. Bert I.Gordon's films weren't known for their quality--the budgets were tiny and the special effects were often cheesy--but they were nearly always entertaining."},

The following year she was cast as Elizabeth Grainger on The Virginian. Elizabeth was the granddaughter of the Shiloh Ranch's new owner, John Grainger (Charles Bickford). She remained on the show until 1970, when The Virginian was revamped. Using the stage name \"Russell Lane\" (Russell was her middle name), she appeared in the movies Schoolgirls in Chains (1973), The Trial of Billy Jack (1974), and Billy Jack Goes to Washington (1977).She retired from acting in the late Seventies. In 1984 she and her husband John Scott were among the founders of Havens Winery 1984. Sara Lane's career was brief and her appearances in film and television were few, but she displayed a good deal of talent. She was convincing as Kit Austin, one of the two prank callers whose calls get them in trouble in I Saw What You Did (1965). She also did quite a good job as Elizabeth on The Virginian, who loved life on the ranch and horses (something which was true of Miss Lane in real life--she had two horses when she was cast on The Virginian). Her career may not have been long, she gave performances that will be remembered."},
{"title": "\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" by Joan Jett & The Blackhearts", "date": "Tuesday, March 7, 2023", "text": "One of the biggest hits of the Eighties in the United States was \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" by Joan Jett & The Blackhearts. What many Americans do not realize is that it was a cover originally recorded by a British band.\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" was written by Alan Merrill and Jake Hooker of the band Arrows. Arrows were a glam rock band in the United Kingdom active from 1974 to 1977. They would have two hits, \"Touch Too Much\" in 1974 and \"My Last Night with You\" in 1975. They also had their own television show, Arrows, which aired in 1976 and 1977 on Granada Television.  The inspiration for \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" came from The Rolling Stones' song \"It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (But I Like It).\" Alan Merrill later said in an interview, \"The Stones had just released ‘It’s Only Rock ’n Roll,’ which sounded a bit apologetic to me. I wanted to say it loud and clear.\" \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" was originally recorded as the B-side of their single, \"Broken Down Heart,\" but was made the A-side. Strangely enough, given the success of Joan Jett's cover of the song, Arrows' original version of \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" did make the UK singles chart. It was while Joan Jett was on a tour of the United Kingdom with The Runaways that she saw Arrows perform\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" on their television show. In 1979 she recorded her first version of the song with Sex Pistols Steve Jones and Paul Cook as a B-side of her cover of \"You Don't Own Me.\" It was in 1981 that she recorded a new version of the song with her band The Blackhearts. It hit no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for seven weeks."},
{"title": "Godspeed Ted Donaldson, Widely Adored Veteran of Old Hollywood", "date": "Monday, March 6, 2023", "text": "As a child actor Ted Donaldson appeared in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945) and the series of film centred upon the German Shepherd named Rusty. While most classic film buffs were familiar with Ted Donaldson's work, for Turner Classic Movies fans Ted Donaldson was something special. Mr. Donaldson attended multiple TCM Classic Film Festivals, so many TCM fans got to meet him. Some even became close friends with him. Ted Donaldson was known not only for his knowledge of Hollywood during its Golden Age, but his affability and warmth. Everyone who met him noted that he was a perfect gentleman. Sadly, Ted Donaldson died on March 1 2023 at the age of 89 from complications from a fall.Ted Donaldson was born on April 20 1933 in Brooklyn, New York. His father was composer Will Donaldson. His mother, Jo, died when he was only a few months old. His father later remarried, marrying composer and radio organist Muriel Pollack. Ted Donaldson attended the Professional Children's School in New York City. It was in 1941 that he joined the Broadway production Life With Father, playing the youngest son Harlan. That same year he appeared on radio in a week-long, serialized adaptation of A Christmas Carol, playing Tiny Tim. In 1943 he was back on Broadway, appearing in Sons and Soldiers, directed by Max Reinhardt. It was his appearance in Sons and Soldiers that led to an audition with Columbia head Harry Cohn for the role of Arthur \"Pinky\" Thompson in Once Upon a Time (1944). Ted Donaldson then made his film debut in Once Upon a Time, in which his character taught his pet caterpillar to dance to \"Yes, Sir, That's My Baby.\" He appeared in the movies Mr. Winkle Goes to War (1944), A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), and A Guy, a Gal and a Paul (1945) before starring as Danny Mitchell, the boy who befriends the German Shepherd Rusty in The Adventures of Rusty (1945). He would appear as Danny Mitchell in seven more \"Rusty\" movies: The Return of Rusty (1946), For the Love of Rusty (1947), The Son of Rusty (1947), My Dog Rusty (1948), Rusty Lead the Way (1948), Rusty Saves a Life (1949), and Rusty's Birthday (1949). In the late Forties he also appeared in the films Personality Kid (1946), The Red Stallion (1947), The Decision of Christopher Blake (1948), and The Green Promise (1949). He also appeared in two shorts, \"My Pal\" (1947) and \"Pal's Adventure\" (1948). In 1949 he began playing the role of Bud Anderson on the radio show Father Knows Best. He continued to play the role until 1954. He was offered the role of Bud in the television version of Father Knows Best, but turned it down because, as he said in the book Growing Up on the Set, \"I didn’t want to be a 21-year-old playing a 15- or 16-year-old kid.\" In the Fifties he appeared in the films Phone Call from a Stranger (!952) and Flight Nurse (1953). He spent most of the decade on television, appearing on the shows Front Row Center, Matinee Theatre, and The Silent Service.As an adult Ted Donaldson taught acting and also worked at a bookstore on Hollywood Boulevard. Ted Donaldson was a remarkable child actor. His performances were always sincere. He was never overly cloying nor overly precocious. He was also quite versatile. He played Neeley, the fun-loving but ultimately responsible younger brother in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. He later played a boy caught in the middle of a divorce, the title character in The Decision of Christopher Blake. He played another child troubled by his parents' behaviour in Phone Call from a Stranger. Ted Donaldson certainly seemed to have a gift for working with animals. Aside from the \"Rusty\" series, he also worked with a burro in Personality Kid and a horse in The Red Stallion. Ultimately, Ted Donaldson was one of the best child actors of all time.As mentioned above, Ted Donaldson appeared many TCM Classic Film Festivals. He also granted many interviews over the years about his career. While I never interacted with Mr. Donaldson, I know people who got to meet him and even those who counted him among their close friends. All of them have spoken of his approachability and kindness. It is not unusual to hear the words \"darling\" and \"sweetheart\" when TCM fans speak of Ted Donaldson. Ted Donaldson was a total gentleman, and TCM fans adored him for it. Sadly, Ted Donaldson died with little in the way of possessions or money. His friends Thomas and Heidi Bruno have set a GoFundMe page for his burial expenses. They hope to bury him in Hollywood Forever Cemetery alongside so many of his co-stars."},
{"title": "DC Comics Movie Serials of the Forties Part Two", "date": "Saturday, March 4, 2023", "text": "Movie serials were a part of most Saturday matinees at movie theatres in the Forties. The Forties were also concurrent with the Golden Age of Comic Books, so that many comic book characters were adapted to movie serials. By 1947 the interrelated companies that would become the modern day DC Comics (National Allied Publications; Detective Comics, Inc.; and All-American Publications) had already had two serials based on their characters: The Batman (1944) and Hop Harrigan (1946). By the end of the decade there would be several more movie serials based on DC Comics characters, including their most popular, Superman.It was in the late Forties that DC Comics as we now know it would come into being. It was on September 30 1946 that National Allied Publications, Detective Comics, and All-American Publications were merged to form National Comics Publications. In 1961 the company was renamed National Periodical Publications. It was in 1977 that the company would finally be named \"DC Comics,\" the name by which National Allied Publications, Detective Comics, and All-American Publications, and afterwards National Periodical Publications, had been known informally since the Golden Age.DC Comics' next movie serial would be based on a character not particularly well known today. The Vigilante was a Western-themed superhero who had first appeared in Action Comics no. 42 (November 1941). The Vigilante was Greg Sanders, a country singer on radio known as \"the Prairie Troubadour.\" After his father was killed, Greg Sanders became The Vigilante, dressed in Western garb with a bandana over his mouth to conceal his identity. He later picked up a sidekick, Stuff the Chinatown Kid, who was one of the few Asian American characters to appear regularly in comic books during the Golden Age (and also one of the few who was not a stereotype). The Vigilante (1947) was the second movie serial based on a DC Comics character to be produced by Sam Katzman. Ralph Byrd, now best known for playing Dick Tracy, was cast as Greg Sanders/The Vigilante. If the casting sounds unusual today, it must be considered that Ralph Byrd began his career as a song and dance man, so he could do his own singing as Greg Sanders. Strangely enough, in the serial Stuff was not a Chinese American teenager. He was played by George Offerman Jr., a white actor who was around 30 at the time. The plot of The Vigilante found the hero trying to prevent the villain known only as X-1 and his gang from getting their hands on a cursed string of red pearls.The Vigilante was somewhat popular for a character in a backup feature in Action Comics and would actually outlast the Golden Age of Comic Books. After his first appearance he appeared in every single issue of Action Comics until issue no. 198, November 1954. This was only a little less than two years before the Silver Age of Comic Books began with the first appearance of the Barry Allen version of The Flash in Showcase no. 4 (October 1956).The next DC Comics character to be featured in a movie serial would be the one that started it all and their most popular character at the time. It was in 1943 that Paramount Pictures discontinued their highly successful series of Superman cartoons because of their sheer cost (each one averaged around $30,000).  As a result the screen rights to Superman once more became available. They were bought by Sam Katzman. While Sam Katzman would sign a contract with Columbia Pictures to make serials in 1945, he offered Superman to other studios before Columbia. He first offered the project to Universal, who had been winding down their production of serials and would entirely stop producing them in 1946. Universal then turned him down. He then approached Republic Pictures, who also turned him down. The reason they gave him was that it would be impossible to portray a superhuman character such as Superman who could fly. It seems likely that this was a mere excuse, as Republic Pictures had produced The Adventures of Captain Marvel in 1941 (in which Captain Marvel flew) and would produce King of the Rocket Men in 1949 (which featured a character who flew). It seems more likely that Republic Pictures resented DC Comics having named them in the lawsuit alleging Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel infringed upon Superman. Even if this was not the case, it must be pointed out that most of Republic Pictures' serials after 1946 were based on original material rather than licensed characters. It was after being turned down by both Universal and Republic that Sam Katzman finally took Superman to Columbia.Of course, casting Superman was of major importance. Several actors were considered for the role, Buster Crabbe, who had played the roles of Tarzan, Buck Rogers, and, most famously, Flash Gordon. Buster Crabbe turned the role down as he felt he had already been typecast in roles of comic strip heroes. Sam Katzman found his actor to play Superman while he was looking through photographs of actors with whom he had worked in the past. Mr. Katzman had previously worked with Kirk Alyn on the movies Little Miss Broadway (1947) and Sweet Genevieve (1947). Unfortunately, DC Comics was not particularly thrilled with the casting of Kirk Alyn in the beginning. At his first meeting concerning the role, Mr. Alyn walked in wearing a moustache and a goatee he had grown for a part in a period piece (probably the 1948 version of The Three Musketeers, in which he had a bit part). Fortunately, Sam Katzman and Kirk Alyn were able to win the comic book company over. As Kirk Alyn told them of his facial hair, \"It shaves off, you know.\"Noel Neill was cast in the role of Lois Lane, after having appeared in Sam Katzman's Teenagers series at Monogram and the serial Brick Bradford (1947) at Columbia. Pierre Watkin, who had also appeared in the serial Brick Bradford, was cast as Daily Planet editor Perry White and Tommy Bond, a veteran of \"Our Gang\" shorts, was cast as Jimmy Olsen. The serial was directed by Spencer Gordon Bennett and Thomas Carr. Spencer Gordon Bennett had directed several serials at Columbia and would go onto direct the second Batman serial, The New Adventures of Batman and Robin (1949). Thomas Carr had also directed several serials for Columbia and would later move into television. Among the episodes of TV shows he directed were episodes of The Adventures of Superman.Of course, one hurdle to be overcome for Superman (1948) was portraying Superman in flight. The special effects crew attempted this by suspending Kirk Alyn from wires (which were supposed to be opaque) in front of a rear projection screen of moving clouds. Unfortunately, the wires were visible in rushes, and as a result Sam Katzman fired the entire special effects crew. The scenes of Superman flying were then animated, which was probably was not particularly convincing even in the 1940s.Regardless, Superman (1948) proved to be a smash hit. Cinemas that had never shown a serial even booked it. Ultimately it became the highest grossing serial of all time. Its success may have also single-handedly revived serial production. For much of the Forties, serials were in decline. It was for that reason that Universal stopped producing serials in 1946. In 1947 Republic Pictures produced only three serials; in 1949, after the success of Superman at Columbia, it produced almost twice as many. Serials would continue to be produced until the release of the last serial, Blazing the Overland Trail, by Columbia in 1956.The next serial based upon a DC Comics character would be based on another character from Action Comics. Congo Bill first appeared in More Fun Comics (June 1940). The character moved to Action Comics the following year, It is pretty obvious the character was inspired by Alex Raymond's comic strip Jungle Jim, with Congo Bill an adventurer living in Africa. In Congo Bill (1948), Bill must find an heiress missing in Africa. Like Hop Harrigan and Superman (1948), it was produced by Sam Katzman for Columbia.Congo Bill was played by Don McGuire. By the time of Congo Bill (1948) he had appeared in the films Humoresque (1946) and Possessed (1947). He would later go into screenwriting, writing the screenplay for Bad Day at Black Rock (1955) and creating the sitcom Hennesey. The missing heiress was played by Cleo Moore, who would become one of the many blonde bombshells of the Fifties. Like Superman (1948) before it, Congo Bill was directed by Spencer Gordon Bennett and Thomas Carr.It was following Congo Bill that another serial featuring Batman and Robin was finally released. The New Adventures of Batman and Robin (1949) was produced by Sam Katzman and directed by Spencer Gordon Bennett. It featured two new actors in the roles of the Dynamic Duo. Robert Lowery was cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He had appeared in such films as The Mark of Zorro (1940) and The Mummy's Ghost (1944). He would later be a regular on the TV series Circus Boy, now best remembered for starring future Monkee Micky Dolenz. Robin was played by Johnny Duncan, who had appeared in various \"East End Kids\" and \"Bowery Boys\" movies. He was 26 years old when he played Robin, and perhaps a bit old to be playing the Boy Wonder. Eric Wilton played Alfred. The New Adventures of Batman and Robin (1949) would feature the first appearances on the big screen of both Commissioner Gordon and Bruce Wayne's long time girlfriend Vicki Vale. Commissioner Gordon had been a part of the Batman mythos since the very beginning, appearing in the very first Batman story in Detective Comics no. 27 (May 1939). In the serial he was played by Lyle Talbot, who had been signed to Warner Bros. in the 1930s and had served on the first board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild. He had already appeared in a serial based on a DC Comics serial, The Vigilante (1946). Vicki Vale had been introduced in Batman no. 49 (October 1948) and would continue to appear regularly in the Batman titles until 1964 before being revived in the modern era. In the serial she was played by Jane Adams, who had appeared in House of Dracula (1945) and several B-Westerns. Her last appearance on screen would be in another DC Comics project, the episode \"\"Ghost Wolf\" of The Adventures of Superman.In The New Adventures of Batman and Robin (1949), the Dynamic Duo face off against The Wizard, a villain with an electrical device that can control cars. Like The Batman (1944), The New Adventures of Batman and Robin (1949) was produced very cheaply. If anything the costumes in The New Adventures of Batman and Robin are even worse than those in The Batman (1944). The bat ears on Batman's costume more resemble devil's horns than bat ears. This time around Batman drives a 1949 Mercury rather than the Batmobile. The serial also features several continuity errors. The most blaring error is perhaps Batman pulling a full sized oxy-acetylene torch that could not possible fit in his utility belt.The New Adventure of Batman and Robin (1949) would be followed by the final serial to be based on a DC Comics character. Atom Man vs. Superman (1950) was the sequel to Superman (1949). Kirk Alyn, Noel Neill, Tommy Bond, and Pierre Watkin all returned in their roles as Superman/Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Perry White. The serial marks the first live-action appearance of Superman's archenemy Lex Luthor. Luthor was played by Lyle Talbot, making Mr. Talbot both the first actor to play Commissioner Gordon and the first actor to play Lex Luthor in live-action films. In Atom Man vs. Superman (1950), Lex Luthor in the guise of Atom Man plagues Metropolis with a number of deadly devices. Atom Man vs. Superman (1950) did improve upon the effects of Superman flying. Kirk Alyn was simply filmed standing in front of a cyclorama with his arms extended,  and a wind machine and smoke pot offscreen above him. The camera was turned on its side. It was an improvement over the animated flying sequences of the first serial. Like the rest of the serials based on DC Comics characters, Atom Man vs. Superman (1950) suffered from a low budget. A scene in which Clark Kent changes into Superman in a storeroom is reused several times. The serial also made a good deal of use of stock footage from Columbia's vaults.Atom Man vs. Superman (1950) would be the last movie serial based on a DC Comics character. With the advent of television, movie serials declined in popularity as the Fifties progressed. Republic Pictures stopped making serials in 1955. Columbia stopped making them in 1956. Of course, Superman would remain in the public eye outside of comic books. In 1951, the year following the release of Atom Man vs. Superman (1950), the feature film Superman vs. the Mole Men (1951), starring George Reeves as Superman, was released. In 1952 the television series The Adventures of Superman, also starring George Reeves, debuted. The Adventures of Superman would owe something to the Superman serials. Phyllis Coates played Lois Lane in the first season, but could not return for the second season due to prior commitments. Noel Neill, who had played Lois in the two serials, then took over the role on the TV series.The serials based on DC Comics characters would see the first live action iterations of  Superman and Batman, and provided exposure for some lesser known DC Comics characters as well. As to why some of DC Comics' other popular characters were not adapted into movie serials, much of the reason may have been special effects. The Flash and Green Lantern were among DC Comics' five most popular characters, but their powers were impossible for 1940s special effects to accomplish. Indeed, in 1990 the TV series The Flash cost $1 million an episode, simply because of producing the illusion of The Flash moving at superspeed. It is curious that Wonder Woman, DC Comics' third most popular character during the Golden Age, was never even considered for a movie serial. It certainly wasn't because there weren't serials centred on women. Tiger Woman (1944), Zorro's Black Whip (1944),  Brenda Starr, Reporter (1945), and several others featured women as their protagonists.As to why some lesser known DC Comics characters were adapted into movie serials, it must be pointed out that in each case they belong to genres that were well-established in serials. Hop Harrigan was yet another heroic aviator to appear on the big screen. Although a superhero whose adventures took place in the present day, The Vigilante was firmly rooted in the Western genre. Of course, Congo Bill firmly belonged in the genre of jungle adventure. Here it must be pointed out that at least two of these characters (The Vigilante and Congo Bill) were featured in Action Comics. I have to wonder that when Sam Katzman was researching Superman, he  fell upon The Vigilante and Congo Bill and thought that they would make for good movie serials.Sadly, the serials based on DC Comics characters are not well respected by connoisseurs of movie serials. All of them were produced at Columbia Pictures, who were not known for spending a lot of money on their serials or even assuring that they would be very high in quality. While Sam Katzman would seem to be an improvement over Larry Darmour Productions (who produced the 1944 serial The Batman), he was still more interested in making movie serials cheaply than he was in making movie serials that were good. Indeed, in The Great Movie Serials, Jim Harmon and Donald F. Glut observe of Mr. Katzman, \"He seemed to get the best characters--including Superman and Batman--and do the worst with them.\"Regardless of the quality of the serials based on DC Comics characters, they would have a lasting impact. It is arguable that the two Batman serials, along with his appearances on the radio show The Adventures of Superman, guaranteed Batman's continued popularity, allowing him to become one of the few comic book characters to be published contiuously since the Golden Age. The Batman (1943) introduced the Batcave and may been responsible for the creation of Alfred (at the very least, it changed his appearance). It was a screening of The Batman (1943) at the Playboy Theatre in 1965 that led to a re-release of the serial under the title An Evening with Batman and Robin that summer. This in turn led to the 1966 TV series Batman starring Adam West and Burt Ward. Batman may not have been the only character impacted by the serials based on DC comic book characters. If The Vigilante lasted until 1954, outlasting many more popular comic book characters, it seems possible that it was partly due to the 1947 serial. It even seems possible that it was the success of the Superman serials that led to the TV series The Adventures of Superman. After all, the serials proved that the Man of Steel could be a success in live action. The serials based on DC Comics characters may not have been very good, but they certainly had a lasting influence."},
{"title": "DC Comics Movie Serials of the Forties Part One", "date": "Friday, March 3, 2023", "text": "While superhero movies have dominated the box office for the past decade, there was a time when superheroes were largely absent from the big screen. From the Fifties to the Eighties, there were few superhero movies made. This was not the case with the Forties, when  movie serials were a part of the typical Saturday morning matinee. Comic books of the era (known as the Golden Age of Comic Books) provided fodder for many movie serials. As might be expected some of these movie serials were based on characters published by the companies that would become DC Comics. They published many of the most popular comic book characters during the era, including Superman and Batman.As to DC Comics, it emerged from three interrelated companies: National Allied Publications; Detective Comics, Inc.; and All-American Publications. The three companies shared owners in common and all three bore the \"DC\" bullet on their covers (hence the then informal name \"DC Comics\"). A good deal of cross-promotion took pace among the companies. Characters from all three companies appeared as members of the Justice Society of America in All-American Publications' title All-Star Comics. The three companies would be merged in 1946, creating a new company called National Comics Publications and still later National Periodical Publications and finally, in 1977, DC Comics. It was what would become DC Comics that kicked off the Golden Age of Comics, not to mention the superhero craze of the Forties, with the publication of Action Comics no. 1, cover dated June 1938, featuring the first appearance of Superman. Superman would prove to be phenomenally popular in the late Thirties into the Forties. While he would be the first comic book superhero to ever appear on the big screen, he would not be the first comic book superhero to appear in a movie serial. It was not long after Superman's first appearance that Republic Pictures optioned the rights for a Superman serial. The serial never came into being as Detective Comics, Inc. demanded more creative control over the production than Republic Pictures was willing to cede. Republic Pictures ultimately used what would have been the script for the Superman serial for the serial  Mysterious Dr. Satan (1940), simply changing the names and particulars of the characters. In the meantime, Superman would find his way to the big screen by way of Paramount Pictures and Fleischer Studios Noting the popularity of Superman, Paramount Pictures approached Max and Dave Fleischer about producing a series of Superman cartoons. Not eager to do Superman cartoons, they quoted Paramount the then astronomical sum (for theatrical cartoons anyway) of $100,000 for the series. To their shock, Paramount accepted. Fleischer Studios then produced and Paramount Pictures distributed a highly successful series of Superman animated shorts. As to Republic Pictures, in 1941 they once more made an attempt at a Superman serial. The project was even announced in a promotional book for movie distributors, Republic Pictures Advance Serial Promotion Book, that year, complete with drawings of proposed scenes for the serial. Unfortunately, it turned out Paramount Pictures had exclusive movie rights to Superman and so Republic Pictures could not make their proposed Superman serial.Republic Pictures then turned to Fawcett Publications and their character Captain Marvel, whose sales rivalled that of the Man of Steel. This did not sit well with Detective Comics, Inc., who even named Republic Pictures alongside Fawcett Publications in their famous lawsuit alleging that Captain Marvel infringed on their copyright for Superman. Regardless, Captain Marvel would then become the first comic book superhero to appear in live-action.Ultimately, despite being their most popular character, Superman would not be the first character from \"DC Comics\" that would be seen in a live-action film. Instead that honour would go to Batman. Batman first appeared in Detective Comics no. 27 (May 1939) and quickly became one of their most popular characters. He was joined by his sidekick, Robin, in Detective Comics no. 38 (April 1940). Given the character's popularity, it should have come as no surprise when Columbia Pictures licensed Batman for a movie serial. This may well have been unfortunate, as Columbia Pictures' serials were made on the cheap and not well known for their high quality. Since 1943 their serials were made by Larry Darmour Productions, which sought to make them as inexpensively as possible.The Batman (1943) starred  Lewis Wilson as Batman (and his alter ego Bruce Wayne) and Douglas Croft as Robin (and his alter ego Dick Grayson). William Austen played Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred. Shirley Patterson played Batman's love interest, Linda Page. Although forgotten today, Linda Page had originated in the comic books, appearing from 1941 to 1943. For whatever reason, Commissioner Gordon did not appear in the serial, although the character of Police Captain Arnold (Charles C. Wilson) largely played the same role. It was directed by Lambert Hillyer, who had previously directed the Universal horror movies The Invisible Ray (1936) and Dracula's Daughter (1936).Today The Batman is not highly regarded. Batman and Robin's costumes were poorly made and did not fit well. The Batmobile is nothing more than an ordinary Cadillac. There are several continuity errors throughout the serial.  In one fight scene Batman's cape is torn off, only to reappear back on the Caped Crusader moments later. Apparently its budget was so low that they could not afford to reshoot scenes even if a mistake was made.Admittedly, some modern viewers might forgive The Batman its poor productions values, but they may not forgive the blatant racism in the serial. Made during World War II, wartime propaganda found its way into the serial, much of it racist in nature. The villain is a Japanese scientist and secret agent named Dr. Daka, played by J. Carrol Naish. Narration in the serial actually refers to the United States government as \"wise\" for interning Japanese Americans during the war. Phrases such as \"shifty eyed Japs\" and \"Jap\" devil actually appear in the serial. Even for the era, The Batman is xenophobic in the extreme. It seems likely that the filmmakers were to blame for the racism and propaganda in The Batman. Wartime propaganda played very little role in the comic books during World War II, with Batman and Robin continuing to battle supervillains and gangsters.While The Batman was not a very poorly made (and by modern standards offensive) serial, it would have a lasting impact on the comic books. In his book Batman: the Complete History, Les Daniels writes that evidence suggests the character of Bruce Wayne's butler (and hence Batman's butler) Alfred was created for the movie serial and that Detective Comics, Inc. asked comic book writer Don Cameron to write Alfred into the comic books with Alfred's first comic book appearance in Batman no. 16 (April 1943). Even if Alfred wasn't created for the serial, the serial was certainly responsible for establishing Alfred's appearance ever since. Originally in the comic books Alfred was portly and clean shaven. Following the serial he was drawn more to conform with actor William Austen's appearance, slender and bearing a thin moustache.While Alfred may or may not have been created for the movie serial. the Batcave most certainly was. In the beginning in the comic books there was only a hidden tunnel that led to a barn where the Batmobile was housed. In Batman no. 12 (August-September 1942) writer and Batman co-creator Bill Finger makes reference to secret underground hangars. It is in The Batman that the idea of an underground headquarters for Batman was introduced. Called \"the Bat's Cave,\" it is first seen in the second chapter of the serial, also called \"The Bat's Cave.\" It was then in Detective Comics no. 83 (January 1944) that the Batcave first appeared in comic books.The next character published by the companies that would become DC Companies to be adapted to a movie serial is largely forgotten today. Hop Harrigan was an aviator hero of the sort popular during the Thirties and Forties. Hop Harrigan first appeared in All-American Comics no. 1 (April 1939). He was a heroic pilot who, with his friend Tank Tinker, runs the All-American Aviation Company. With the beginning of World War II, Hop became a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Although only a back-up feature in All-American Comics, Hop Harrigan proved popular. He eventually appeared in such titles as All-Flash, All-Star Comics, Comic Cavalcade, and Green Lantern. In 1942 Hop Harrigan received his own radio show on the Blue Network. With air adventure a popular genre for movie serials and Hop Harrigan a popular comic book character who was also the star of a popular radio show, it was perhaps natural that Columbia Pictures would license Hop Harrigan for a movie serial.By the time that the movie serial Hop Harrigan was made, Larry Darmour Productions was no longer making Columbia's serials. It was in 1945 that legendary producer Sam Katzman signed a contract with Columbia Pictures to make serials and B-movies for the studio. Known as \"Jungle Sam\" due to the sheer number of jungle adventure movies he had made, Mr. Katzman was known for making movies with very little money that would make a whole lot of money at the box office. Hop Harrigan (1946) starred William Blakewell in the title role, with Jennifer Holt playing Hop's girlfriend Gail Nolan. Sumner Getchell played Hop's firend Tank Tinker. It was directed by  Derwin Abrahams, who directed several B-Westerns in his career. The screenplay was by Ande Lamb and George H. Plympton. Ande Lamb's first screenplay was Police Bullets in 1942 and he would continue to work up into the Seventies, writing scripts for such television shows as The Lone Ranger and The Cisco Kid. George H. Plympton's career went back to the Silent Era and over the years he worked on several serials. In fact, he would work on every remaining serial based on a DC Comics characters. He was nothing if not prolific.The first chapter of Hop Harrigan was released on March 28 1946. Both the books The Great Movie Serials by Jim Harmon and Donald F. Blut and In the Nick of Time by Andrew C. Cline are fairly complimentary when it comes to the serial. Unfortunately, neither the serial nor the highly successful radio show would guarantee Hop Harrigan's survival. Hop Harrigan last appeared in All-American Comics no. 99 (July 1948) and has not been seen in DC Comics much since. The late Forties would see yet more serials based on DC Comics characters. Indeed, it would only be two years after Hop Harrigan that Superman would finally be seen in live action."},

{"title": "The Late Great Ricou Browning", "date": "Tuesday, February 28, 2023", "text": "Ricou Browning, best known for playing the Creature in the underwater scenes of Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) and its two sequels, died yesterday, February 27 2023 at the age of 93. He also co-created the TV series Flipper and directed episodes of the show.Ricou Browning was born on February 16 1930 in For Pierce, Florida. He attended Florida State University. He went to work for well known swimmer and promoter Newt Perry in water shows at Weeki Wachee Springs in Florida. It was in 1953 that he was asked to show Wakulla Springs, Florida to location scouts from Universal looking for locations to film the upcoming movie Creature from the Black Lagoon. They ultimately cast Ricou Browning to play the Creature when he was underwater (Ben Chapman played the Creature on land). It was the same year that he served as a stunt diver on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954).Ricou Browning played the Creature in two sequels, Revenge of the Creature (1955) and The Creature Walks Among Us (1956). He also guest starred on episodes of the TV shows Sea Hunt and Flipper, and played Dr. Buron in the movie Flipper's New Adventure (1964). He served as an underwater swimming double for Jerry Lewis on Don't Give Up the Ship (1959). He was a stunt coordinator on  The Heavenly Kid (1985), and Opposing Force (1986). Ricou Browning also served as a director of underwater sequences on the movies Thunderball (1965), Daring Game (1968), Lady in Cement (1968), and The Aquarians (1970). He served as a second unit director on the movies Thunderball (1965), Around the World Under the Sea (1966), Island of the Lost (1967), Hello Down There (1969), Joe Panther (1976), Hot Stuff (1979), Caddyshack (1980), Nobody's Perfekt (1981), and Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach (1988).  He also served as a second unit director on the TV show The Aquanauts.Ricou Browning wrote the story for the movie Flipper (1963) and as a result is considered a co-creator of the television show of the same name. On the show he served as an associate producer and directed several episodes. He also directed episodes of Gentle Ben, Primus, and Salty as well as the movies Salty (1973) and Mr. No Legs (1978). He was underwater photography supervisor on the TV show Sea Hunt and underwater photographer on the movie Island of the Lost (1967).Ricou Browning will always be remembered as the Creature from the Black Lagoon. His remarkable ability to swim made him, not to mention his ability to hold his breath, made him very convincing in the role. Of course, he did much more than play the Creature from the Black Lagoon. He was responsible for the story for the film Flipper, which led to the popular TV series of the same name. And he served as a director of underwater scenes on various movies and TV shows, and a supervisor on yet others. His expertise when it came to filming underwater would prove invaluable on many productions. From Creature from the Black Lagoon to his other projects, Ricou Browning made important contributions to film and television history."},
{"title": "The Late Great Walter Mirisch", "date": "Monday, February 27, 2023", "text": "It is fully possible that Walter Mirisch produced more of my favourite movies than anyone else. Through the years he produced such classics as The Apartment (1960), The Magnificent Seven (1960), The Great Escape (1963), and In the Heat of the Night (1967). Aside from producing a large number of truly great films, he was also known as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. Walter Mirisch died at age 101 on February 24 2023.Walter Mirisch was born on November 8 1921 in New York City. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx and attended the Harvard Business School. He moved to Los Angeles in 1945 and soon found a job working for the general manager of Monogram Studios. It was there that he produced his first film, Fall Guy (1947). It was while he was at Monogram Studios that he conceived the \"Bomba the Jungle Boy\" series of movies, remembering the \"Bomba the Jungle Boy\" books he had read as a child. He was only 29 when he became the head of Allied Artists, the division at Monogram dedicated to producing more expensive, \"A\" pictures. In the late Forties Walter Mirisch produced such movies as I Wouldn't Want to Be in Your Shoes (1948), Bomba the Jungle Boy (1949), Bomba on Panther Island (1949), The Lost Volcano (1950), County Fair (1950), and Bomba and the Hidden City (1950). It was in 1957 that Walter Mirisch founded the Mirisch Company with his brothers Marvin and Harold Mirisch. The Mirisch Company would be responsible for producing some of the greatest films of all time, including Some Like It Hot (1959), The Apartment (1960), The Magnificent Seven (1960), West Side Story (1961), The Great Escape (1963), The Pink Panther (1963), In the Heat of the Night (1967), and yet others. They also released the series of \"Pink Panther\" theatrical shorts made by DePaite-Freleng Enterprises. In the Fifties Walter Mirisch produced the films The Lion Hunters (1951), Cavalry Scout (1951), Elephant Stampede (1951), Flight to Mars (1951), Fort Osage (1952), Rodeo  (1952), Wild Stallion (1952), African Treasure (1952), The Rose Bowl Story (1952), Flat Top (1952), Bomba and the Jungle Girl (1952), Hiawatha (1952), Safari Drums (1953), The Maze (1953), Fighter Attack (1953), The Golden Idol (1954), Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954), Killer Leopard (1954), The Human Jungle (1955), The Big Combo (1955), Seven Angry Men (1955), An Annapolis Story (1955), The Dark Avenger (1955), Lord of the Jungle (1955), Wichita (1955), The Phenix City Story (1955), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), World Without End (1956), Crime in the Streets (1956), The First Texan (!956), Hold Back the Night (1956), Friendly Persuasion (1956), The Undead (1957), The Oklahoman (1957), The Tall Stranger (1957), Fort Massacre (1958), Man of the West (1958), The Man in the Net (1959), The Gunfight in Dodge City (1959), The Horse Soldiers (1959), Cast a Long Shadow (1959), and The Magnificent Seven (1960). He and his brothers produced the short lived TV Western series Wichita Town, inspired by the 1955 movie Wichita, in conjunction with star Joel McCrea. In the Sixties Walter Mirisch produced the films West Side Story (1961), The Children's Hour (1961), Follow That Dream (1962), Kid Galahad (1962), Two for the Seasaw (1962), The Great Escape (1963), Toys in the Attic (1963), The Pink Panther (1963), 633 Squadron (1964), A Shot in the Dark (1964), The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming (1966), Hawaii (1966), How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1967), In the Heat of the Night (1967), Fitzwilly (1967), The Party (1968), The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), Sinful Davey (1969), Some Kind of Nut (1969), Halls of Anger (1970), The Landlord (1970), The Hawaiians (1970), and They Call Me Mister Tibbs! (1970). In the Seventies Walter Mirisch produced the movies The Organization (1971), Fiddler on the Roof (1971), Scorpio (1973), The Spikes Gang (1974), Mr. Majestyk (1974), Midway (1976), Gray Lady Down (1978), Same Time, Next Year (1978), The Prisoner of Zenda (1979), and Dracula (1979). He was the executive producer on the TV movie High Midnight. In the Eighties Walter Mirisch produced the feature film Romantic Comey (1983) and the TV movie Desperado. In the Nineties he served as an executive producer on the TV movies Trouble Shooters-Trapped Beneath the Earth and A Case for Life. In the Teens he served as an executive producer on the TV movie Bridal Wave and the feature films The Magnificent Seven (2016) and The Pink Panther (2022).Walter Mirisch served as president of the Producers Guild of America for three terms, and  President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for four terms. He was a  a trustee of the Motion Picture and Television Fund. Few producers had a track record as good as Walter Mirisch and his brothers. Many of the films often rank in lists of the greatest films ever made. Even a list of the directors with whom Walter Mirisch worked is impressive: Billy Wilder, Blake Edwards, Norman Jewison, and others. Indeed, The Mirisch Company boasted three Academy Awards for Best Picture, received for The Apartment (1960), West Side Story (1961), and In the Heat of the Night (1967). Walter Mirisch certainly had an eye for good material that was also guaranteed to do well at the box office. What is more, he was not afraid to take chances. He encountered resistance from financiers regarding In the Heat of the Night, who worried it would not play in the South. What is more, Walter Mirisch was always supportive of filmmakers. It is little wonder why so many legendary directors worked with him.Walter Mirisch was not only a great producer, but he was also a true gentleman in a profession not known for gentlemen. Elmore Leonard dedicated his novel satirizing the film industry to Walter Mirisch, \"...one of the good guys.\" Steven Speilberg referred to Mr. Mirisch as \"..both a gentleman and an ardent advocate of good films.\" Walter Mirisch attended the TCM Classic Film Festival multiple times, and those who met him have all commented on just how very nice he was. Walter Mirisch was a giant in the world of film production. He was also one of the nicest people in the industry."},
{"title": "TCM Underground R.I.P.", "date": "Saturday, February 25, 2023", "text": "On February 22 2023 it was announced that TCM Underground, Turner Classic Movies' Friday night/Saturday morning programming block dedicated to obscure and sometimes downright odd movies, was ending its run on Friday, February 24. Fittingly, the last movie aired on TCM Underground was Ed Wood's camp classic Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959). Given Millie De Chirico, who had programmed TCM Underground since 2007, was laid off in December of the past year (2022), the announcement of TCM Underground's cancellation perhaps came as no surprise to TCM fans. Still, the announcement was met with disappointment from the show's many fans.TCM Underground was originally conceived by former Turner Classic Movies marketing director Eric Weber as a higher class version of the old horror movie anthologies aired on local stations, often with a host. The original intent behind TCM Underground was to attract younger viewers to the channel, which, rightly or wrongly, was thought to appeal to an older audience. In its earliest days TCM Underground even had its own horror host in the form of rock musician and movie director Rob Zombie. It was on October 14 2006 that TCM Underground was launched with an Ed Wood double bill of Plan 9 from Outer Space and Bride of the Monster (2005). The first major change to TCM Underground was that it lost its host. Rob Zombie last hosted TCM Underground on December 16 2006, introducing West of Zanzibar (1928) and The Unholy Three (1925).  Turner Classic Movies never replaced Rob Zombie and the programming block continued to air without a host for the rest of its history.A much bigger change occurred to TCM Underground in 2007 when Millie De Chirico became the show's programmer. Rather than the old horror hosts, Millie De Chirico looked to such Eighties cable television programs as Night Flight and USA Up All Night, as well as the late night programming of such premium channels as HBO and Showtime, for inspiration. TCM Underground began showing an eclectic mix of movies, from cult classics such as Let's Scare Jessica to Death (1971) to such Hollywood oddities as Xanadu (1980) to such obscurities as Private Property (1960). Over the years TCM Underground aired such diverse films as the classic The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T. (1953), the B horror movie Alligator (1980), the classic Blaxploitation movie Coffy (1973), the sci-fi classic Death Race 2000 (1975),  Enter the Ninja (1981--the movie that started the Eighties ninja craze), the aerobics musical Heavenly Bodies (1984), the teen comedy Little Darlings (1980), the Japanese horror movie Jigoku (1960), the big budget sci-fi film Logan's Run (1976), the camp classic Prehistoric Women (1967), the propaganda film Reefer Madness (1935), and even the Seventies action movie The Super Cops (1974). While many of my friends were, I have to confess I was never a regular viewer of TCM Underground. It was on just a bit too late for me. Even so, I would watch some of the movies shown on TCM Underground on the Watch TCM app and On Demand. I always appreciated its similarity to such programs of my youth as Night Flight and USA Up All Night. And I do think TCM Underground filled a much needed niche on the Turner Classic Movies schedule. Prior to TCM Underground it was rare that one saw such oddities as Spider Baby (1967) or The World's Greatest Sinner (1962) on TCM. Indeed, TCM Underground often aired rarely seen, truly obscure films. It was one of the few places where one might see Zig Zag (1970) or The Ninth Configuration (1980). And TCM Underground did show some true classics alongside the cult films and the more obscure movies. The cancellation of TCM Underground leaves a hole in cable schedules that probably won't soon be filled. Programs such as Night Flight and USA Up All Night fell by the wayside in the Nineties, and TCM Underground took over their mantle of showing cult films and cinematic obscurities. There is currently no other program that does this on any of the major cable channels. It is little wonder that TCM Underground has a large number of devoted fans. Indeed, I have to wonder that TCM's ratings for late night Friday/early morning Saturday won't drop with the demise of TCM Underground."},
{"title": "Barbarella (1968)", "date": "Friday, February 24, 2023", "text": "(This post is part of the Fifth So Bad It's Good Blogathon hosted by Taking Up Room)The Space Age and the Sexual Revolution were two events that coincided, both roughly taking place in the Fifties and the Sixties. It was probably these two events that resulted in the French comic strip Barbarella, created by Jean-Claude Forest. Jean-Claude Forest imagined Barbarella as an emancipated woman of the sort that the Sexual Revolution might produce. In the comic strip Barbarella travelled through space, often winding up in sexual situations with aliens. The comic strip first appeared in the spring of 1962 in the French magazine V. It was in 1964 that publisher Éric Losfeld collected the comic strip stories into the book Barbarella. In France Barbarella was a source of some controversy as one of the first adult comic strips ever published. Barbarella would find its way to the United States, with an English translation by Richard Seaver appearing in issues 37 to 39 (1965-1966) of Evergreen Review. While controversial in its native France, the comic strip Barbarella was also popular. It should then come as no surprise that a screen adaptation of the comic strip would come about only a few years after its debut. Producer Dino De Laurentiis bought the film rights to the comic strip. He then negotiated a distribution deal in the United States between the French production company Marianne Productions (which would produce the film) and Paramount Pictures. Although Barbarella remains one of Jane Fonda's best known roles, she was not the first actress considered for the part. Virna Lisi, Bridget Bardot, and even Sophia Loren were all approached about starring in the film. Finally Jane Fonda was cast in the role of Barbarella. Her husband at the time, Roger Vadim, would be the film's director. According to Miss Fonda's autobiography My Life So Far, he was enthusiastic about science fiction movies and believed they were \"the wave of the future.\" Terry Southern, known for his novel Candy as well as having worked on the screenplays for Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) and The Loved One (1965), was hired to write the screenplay. While Terry Southern's screenplay drew upon Jean-Claude Forest's first batch of Barbarella stories, he largely altered the character of Barbarella from that of the comic strip to something more resembling his character Candy from his novel of the same name. Like Candy, Terry Southern's Barbarella was a wide eyed innocent who often finds herself in sexual situations. While Mr. Southern enjoyed working on the script, he also thought Dino De Laurentiius wasn't particularly interested in making a good film. In the end, seven other screenwriters would be credited for the screenplay for Barbarella, with Charles B. Griffith later saying he did uncredited work on the screenplay. Jane Fonda would later say that they had not worked out the screenplay in advance.It is perhaps because of the sheer number of writers that worked on Barbarella that the film's plot is not particularly easy to describe.  The President of the Republic of Earth (Claude Dauphin) assigns Barbarella (Jane Fonda) the task of locating scientist Durand Durand (Milo O'Shea), who has developed a positronic ray capable of mass destruction. She crash lands on the 16th planet of the Tau Ceti system. From there she encounters children with flesh eating, mechanical dolls, Mark Hand, the Catchman whose job is to retrieve stray children (Ugo Tognazzi); Pygar, a blind angel who can no longer fly (John Phillip Law); Pygar's mentor, Professor Ping (Marcel Marceau); and ultimately The Great Tyrant, also known as the Black Queen, essentially the villain of the film (Anita Pallenberg). As seen above,  Barbarella featured several notable actors beyond Jane Fonda. Immediately prior to Barbarella, John Phillip Law had appeared  in the title role in Dino De Laurentiis's Danger Diabolik (1968). He had earlier appeared in the comedy The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! (1966) and later played the title role  in the Ray Harryhausen movie The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973). Of interest to comic book fans, John Phillip Law not only read the Barbaella comic strip, but comic books featuring DC Comics' Hawkman as well to prepare for his role. Anita Pallenberg had a relationship with The Rolling Stones' Brian Jones and would later have one with Keith Richards. Milo O' Shea was a veteran of stage and screen who had played Leopold Bloom in the 1967 screen adaptation of Ulysses. Of course, Marcel Marceau was a world famous mime who appeared frequently on variety shows on both sides of the Atlantic.Filming on Barbarella began on June 6 1967 and continued until November of that year. It was filmed at Dino De Laurentiis Cinematografica Studios in Rome. Barbarella was released in the United States on October 10 1968. Barbarella  was not particularly well received by critics. Variety called its script \"flat\" and described the cast as \"not particularly adept at comedy.\" The New York Times noted that following the film's initial, now famous, zero gravity strip tease scene, Barbarella \"...rapidly becomes a special kind of mess.\" The Globe and Mail stated that following the striptease scene, \"we are plunged back into the mundane, not to say inane world , of the spy thriller with a dreary overlay of futuristic science-fiction.\" As might be expected, even though it is mild by today's standards, the sexual content of Barbarella was controversial upon its initial release. The National Legion of Decency gave Barbarella a \"condemned\" rating , which meant practising Catholics should not see the film, and even attacked the Production Code Administration for having approved it. If Barbarella was not particularly well received by critics upon its initial release, it could be because the film was a bit of an anachronism even in 1968. Barbarella appears to have been made with a camp aesthetic in mind. The style known as camp, which according to Susan Sontag in her famous 1964 essay Notes on Camp emphasizes artifice, frivolity, and middle-class pretentiousness, was a bit of a fad in the mid-Sixties. Indeed, the hit television series Batman was intentionally made in a camp style. Like many fads, however, camp ran its course and was pretty much out of fashion with mainstream audiences by 1968. Even if Barbarella was not intentionally made as camp, it would certainly seem to qualify as such. The film's production design is over the top in a way that only Federico Fellini films might usually be. Particularly given 2001: A Space Odyssey was released in the same year, the special effects in Barbarella seem rather cheesy. The music can rightfully be described as psychedelic. The episodic plot of Barbarella is hardly progressive in its portrayal of the sexes. In many respects Barbarella simply fills the role of a Space Age damsel in distress. The movie has even been described as adolescent and it is hard to argue that it isn't. Even so, the film's plot is so outrageous that it is hard to take seriously. Quite simply, it is so over the top as to be laughable. Even though it was meant to be a comedy and may have been meant to be camp, it may well succeed in ways Roger Vadim did not intend for it to.If there is one thing that keeps Barbarella from being a truly bad film it is Jane Fonda's performance as Barbarella. As Barbarella, Jane Fonda projects an innocence and sweetness that greatly adds to the film's appeal. Indeed, if Barbarella works as a camp classic, it may well be because of the sincerity of Jane Fonda's performance. The film certainly would not be nearly as enjoyable without her.Despite being critically lambasted upon its initial release, Barbarella would become a cult classic and would even have a lasting impact. Among other things, the classic New Wave band Duran Duran took their name from Milo O'Shea's character in the movie, Durand Durand. Barbarella would also have a lasting impact on the production design and costumes of science fiction TV shows and movies. The animated television series Æon Flux and the movie The Fifth Element (1997) both drew some inspiration from Barbarella. Barbarella is an altogether ridiculous film, but at the same time it is an appealing movie for those who appreciate camp or even kitsch. For those who are willing to suspend their disbelief (or even their tastes) for  98 minutes, it can be quite enjoyable. Certainly there was never a science fiction movie like it before and there hasn't ever been one like it since."},
{"title": "The Short-Lived 1970 Sitcom Barefoot in the Park", "date": "Thursday, February 23, 2023", "text": "The Odd Couple, starring Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, remains the best known sitcom based on a Neil Simon play. What has been forgotten is that when The Odd Couple debuted, there was another sitcom based on a Neil Simon play. Barefoot in the Park was based on Neil Simon's 1963 play of the same name, upon which the 1967 feature film starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda was also based. What made the sitcom Barefoot in the Park different from many adaptation of Neil Simon's works is that the cast was predominantly Black.The sitcom Barefoot in the Park was developed for television by Bill Idelson and Harvey Miller. Bill Idelson may be best remembered for playing Sally's boyfriend Herman Glimscher on The Dick Van Dyke Show. From acting he had moved into writing, writing episodes of The Dick Van Dyke Show; The Andy Griffith Show; Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.; and several other shows. Harvey Miller had written for such shows as Studio One, Accidental Family, The Mothers-In-Law, and That Girl. Barefoot in the Park starred Scoey Mitchell as Paul Bratter, a lawyer for the firm Kendricks, Keene & Klein. He had only recently married his wife Corie (played by Tracy Reed). Corie's mother, Mabel, who was always meddling in their marriage, was played by Thelma Carpenter. Nipsey Russell played the local pool hall owner, Honey, and an admirer of Corie's mother. Scoey Mitchell had guest starred on Get Smart and was part of the recurring cast on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. He guest starred on The Mothers-In-Law, Here Come the Brides, The Carol Burnett Show, and That Girl. Tracy Reed had appeared in the unsold 1967 pilot Me and Benjy and guest starred on The Brady Bunch. Thelma Carpenter was a successful jazz singer who had appeared on variety shows in the Fifties and Sixties. Nipsey Russell was perhaps best known at the time as Officer Dave Anderson on the classic sitcom Car 54, Where Are You? and appearances on many variety shows during the era.Barefoot in the Park debuted on ABC on September 24 1970, with The Odd Couple debuting immediately afterwards. Both of the new sitcoms were scheduled following Bewitched, so it may be safe to assume that ABC was hoping the audience for Bewitched would stick around for the two new shows. Unfortunately, Bewitched fell in the ratings that season, so that the 1970-1971 season was the first one in which the show, at one time a top ten program, did not rank in the top thirty shows for the year. The weak performance of Bewitched perhaps had some effect on the ratings of both Barefoot in the Park and The Odd Couple, as neither show did particularly well in the ratings.Of course, part of the problem with the ratings for Barefoot in the Park might have been that audiences never became enamoured of the show. While there were no bad reviews, reviews of the show were lukewarm at best. Columnist Ernie Kreiling wrote of Barefoot in the Park in his column from around November 22 1970, \"It's not always funny; It's not always unfunny. It's just there to be watched or ignored as one wishes, always in the knowledge that if your attention wanders you're not really missing much.\" After the show had been cancelled, in her March 6 1971 column, Hazel Garland wrote, \"Unfortunately, the show just wasn't as good as the pilot had indicated. Few episodes were really funny.\" Even if the ratings had been better, it is possible Barefoot in the Park would not have lasted long. There is a reason The Odd Couple  survived, but it didn't. Lead actor Scoey Mitchell came into conflict with ABC executive vice president in charge of programming Douglas S. Cramer. According to Scoey Mitchell, he was \"forced to do the Uncle Tom bit.\" According to Earl Wilson's column from October 23 1970, Scoey Mitchell not only punched a network vice president, knocking out one of his teeth (although unnamed, one has to assume it was Douglas S. Cramer), but even punched co-star Thelma Carpenter. Ultimately, ABC cancelled Barefoot in the Park after only twelve episodes, perhaps in part so they would not have to replace Scoey Mitchell. Fortunately for Scoey Mitchell, Barefoot in the Park would not end his career. He went on to make many guest appearances on television and even had a recurring role on Rhoda.Today it is difficult to evaluate Barefoot in the Park today as it is not widely available. Running only one season, it is not available in syndication nor on any streaming services. It has never been released on VHS or DVD. In his book Primetime Blues: African Americans on Television, esteemed film and television historian Donald Bogle wrote of the sitcom, \"...the creators had no idea what the real Black bourgeosie was like and relied (with its older characters) instead on trite, hand-me-down depictions from the past.\" He further wrote of the show, \"Ultimately, Barefoot in the Park seemed a standard, generic, white middle-class comedy that was hopelessly out of sync with contemporary outlooks and interests.\"Regardless, Barefoot in the Park was historic in that it was the first sitcom since Amos 'n' Andy to have an all Black cast. Both Julia and The Bill Cosby Show, which had debuted in the years leading up to 1970, had both Black and white characters in their casts. In that respect, it paved the way for other shows with predominantly Black casts, including Sanford and Son and Good Times."},
{"title": "The Late Great Richard Belzer", "date": "Monday, February 20, 2023", "text": "Richard Belzer, the comedian and actor best known for playing Detective John Munch on Homicide: Life on the Streets and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, as well as many other shows, died yesterday, February 19 2023, at the age of 78. Richard Belzer was born on August 4 1944 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. His mother was physically abusive, and his comedy grew out of trying to make his mother laugh so she would not hit him. He attended Dean Junior College in Franklin, Massachusetts, but was expelled because of organizing protests on campus. He worked a number of odd jobs, including census taker, dock worker, jewellery salesman, and even a reporter for The Bridgeport Post. It was his father's suicide attempt, three years after his mother had died of breast cancer, that spurred him to try his hand at stand-up comedy. To that end, Richard Belzer answered an ad in The Village Voice for an audition for Channel One, a comedy troupe based out of East Village in New York City. His audition was successful and he became part of Channel One in 1971. Channel One's skits, which parodied television, would eventually lead to the movie The Groove Tube (1974), which marked Richard Belzer's movie debut. In the late Seventies Richard Belzer worked as the warm-up comedian for Saturday Night Live and also appeared on the show three times. He also appeared on the TV shows Sesame Street and Fame.In the Eighties Richard Belzer appeared in the movies Author! Author! (1982), Night Shift (1982), Café Flesh (1982),. Flicks (1983), Scarface (1983), Likely Stories, Vol. 3 (1983), America (1986), The Wrong Guys (1988), Freeway (1988), The Big Picture (1989), Fletch Lives (1989), and The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990). He guest starred on the shows Not Necessarily the News, Moonlighting, Miami Vice, D.C. Follies, and Tattingers. Richard Belzer had a recurring role as smarmy television reporter Joe Kline on the short-lived television show The FlashIn the Nineties he had a recurring role as the no-nonsense Inspector Henderson on Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. It was in 1993 that he began playing Detective John Munch on Homicide: Life on the Streets.John Munch was an acerbic, sceptical police officer who nonetheless believed in several conspiracy theories. Following the end of Homicide: Life on the Streets in 1999, Richard Belzer began appearing in a regular role as John Munch on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. He would ultimately appear on other Law & Order series as well, including the original Law & Order, Law & Order: Trial By Jury as well. Not only did the character appear on other Law & Order shows, but also The X-Files, The Beat, Arrested Development, The Wire, 30 Rock, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and American Dad. In the end Richard Belzer played John Munch for 23 years and the character John Munch may well have appeared on more individual television series than any other character in the history of television.In the Nineties, aside from his appearances as Detective Munch, Richard Belzer also guest starred on such television shows as Monsters, Good Sports, Human Target, Nurses, The Larry Sanders Show, Mad About You, South Park, and 3rd Rock from the Sun. He appeared in the movies Off and Running (1991), Missing Pieces (1991), Mad Dog and Glory (1993), Snake Eyes (1993), North (1994), The Puppet Masters (1994), Not of This Earth (1995), Girl 6 (1996), A Very Brady Sequel (1996), Species II (1998), Jump (1999), and Man on the Moon (1999).In the Naughts Mr. Belzer continued to appear as Detective Munch on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and other shows. He guest starred on the show Minding the Store. He appeared in the movie Polish Bar (2010). In the Teens he continued starring as John Munch on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and other shows. He guest starred on 30 Rock. He appeared in the movie Santorini Blue (2013). His final television guest appearance was on American Dad, where he played John Munch. His last movie appearance was in The Comedian in 2016, where he played himself. Richard Belzer retired from acting in 2017. Richard Belzer was also the author of the books How to Be a Stand-Up Comic; UFOs, JFK, and Elvis: Conspiracies You Don't Have to Be Crazy to Believe; and I'm Not a Cop! A Novel.As a comedian Richard Belzer was a genius. He was known for engaging with his audiences. His comedy act was a balance of friendliness and sarcasm. His humour was often edgy and irreverent. It is little wonder that Mr. Belzer often found himself playing stand-up comics and masters of ceremonies in movies and television shows. He was so perfect as a stand-up comic that it was natural for producers to want to cast him in those sorts of roles.Of course, Richard Belzer played more roles than stand-up comics and Detective John Munch. On The Flash he played TV commentator and reporter Joe Kline. Unlike many of Mr. Belzer's other characters, Joe Kline is a bit sleazy and much more concerned with his television ratings than the truth. He often proved to be a thorn in The Flash's side just by doing sensationalistic stories about the hero. Inspector Henderson on Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman was about as far from Joe Kline as one could get. He was straight forward and honest, and dealt fairly with reporters Lois and Clark. While Richard Belzer did play other roles, I think there can be no doubt that he will always be remembered as Detective John Munch. Not only did he play the character for decades, but he played him on multiple shows. And it is largely because of Richard Belzer that John Munch may be one of the greatest television characters of all time. Detective Munch was cynical and sarcastic. His politics veered towards the left and he had a tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. While John Munch might often doubt the overall honesty of the human race, he ultimately cared about his fellow human beings. If he was dogged in pursuing cases, it was because he cared about the victims of those crimes. It is little wonder that audiences loved and still love John Munch. Richard Belzer brought a humanity to the character that is not often seen in many long-running television characters."},
{"title": "The Sammy Davis Jr. Show", "date": "Sunday, February 19, 2023", "text": "Variety shows were a popular format in the Sixties, with such successes as The Hollywood Palace and The Carol Burnett Show. It was also a period when the career of Sammy Davis Jr. was at its height. The singer and actor had appeared in such movies as Ocean's 11 (1960) and Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964), as well as such television shows as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Rifleman, and The Danny Thomas Show. He also had a highly successful recording career, having released albums regularly since 1955. A variety show starring Sammy Davis Jr. would seem to have been primed for success. Unfortunately, it did not turn out that way for The Sammy Davis Jr. Show.Although it was short-lived, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show was historic. While variety shows were common in the Fifties and Sixties, there had been only a few Black performers to have hosted them. In 1948 Bob Howard became the first Black performer to host a regularly scheduled show on television. The Bob Howard Show aired once a week on WCBS, New York City's CBS affiliate. In 1950 Hazel Scott became the first Black performer to host a television show on a broadcast network. The Hazel Scott Show aired on the Dumont Television Network from January 3 1950 to September 29 1950. It was on November 5 1956 that The Nat King Cole Show debuted on NBC. Despite the phenomenal success of Nat King Cole, the show was unable to find a national sponsor. As a result, it aired its last edition on December 17 1957. With The Sammy Davis Jr. Show, Sammy Davis Jr. then became only the fourth Black performer to host his own variety show.Sammy Davis Jr. had long wanted his own television show. He had filmed a pilot for a sitcom called Three for the Road (and alternatively We Three  and Three's Comany) as early as 1953, but it didn't sell. It was in 1965 that Sammy Davis Jr. shot two television specials for ABC, the first of which (Sammy Davis Jr. and the Wonderful World of Children) aired on November 25 1965. Despite having shot two specials for ABC, it was NBC who approached Sammy Davis Jr. about hosting his own variety show. To a degree this should come as no surprise. Sammy Davis Jr. had hosted NBC's rock 'n' roll show Hullabloo several times. Furthermore, NBC's World War II drama Convoy had absolutely bombed on Friday nights, and the network wanted to replace it as quickly as possible.To produce The Sammy Davis Jr. Show, Joe Hamilton was tapped. Joe Hamilton had produced the highly successful Garry Moore Show, on which he had met his wife Carol Burnett. The writers on The Sammy Davis Jr. Show included Bill Angelos and Buz Kohan. Bill Angelos was a veteran of The Perry Como Show and had written on Sammy Davis Jr.'s special Sammy Davis Jr. and the Wonderful World of Children. Buz Kohan had worked on the TV series Ford Presents the New Christy Minstrels and had also written on the special Sammy Davis Jr. and the Wonderful World of Children. To better acquaint Joe Hamilton, Bill Angelos, and Buz Kohan with his act, Sammy Davis Jr. had them watch every performance of his four nights at the Fountainbleau Hotel in Miami, Florida.Unfortunately, things would go awry for The Sammy Davis Jr. Show almost immediately. With The Sammy Davis Jr. Show set to debut on January 7 1966, ABC decided to air its second Sammy Davis Jr. special (Sammy and Friends) on February 1 1966. This would not be a problem except ABC had a clause in their contract with Sammy Davis Jr. stating that he could not appear on television 21 days before the special and 8 days afterwards. In other words,after the premiere of The Sammy Davis Jr. Show, Sammy Davis Jr. would not be able to host his own show for a month. Unfortunately, NBC would not move the premiere date of The Sammy Davis Jr. Show, nor would ABC air the special at an earlier date in December 1965. ABC even refused an offer from Sammy Davis Jr. to buy the special.NBC reran the classic television special Peter Pan in the timeslot of The Sammy Davis Jr. Show one night, which left the network and Sammy Davis Jr. with only three guest hosts to find for the show. Ultimately, it would be Johnny Carson, Sean Connery, and Jerry Lewis who would substitute for Sammy Davis Jr. on the show.If the inability of Sammy Davis Jr. to host his own show was not enough of a problem, a greater problem may have been the critical lambasting the show's premiere received. Sammy Davis Jr.'s guests on the first show were Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, the megastars of the highest calibre. Unfortunately, Sammy Davis Jr.'s interview with the two stars turned out to be rather dull, as did Sammy Davis Jr., Elizabeth Taylor, and Richard Burton's musical performances. Critics tore the show apart. Tom Mackin of The Newark Evening News commented, \"Although no one knows what makes Sammy run, Liz and Dick slowed him to a walk.\"The premiere having received blistering reviews from critics, Sammy Davis Jr. then changed the format of the show so that it would more allow himself to be himself. He returned to The Sammy Davis Jr. Show on February 11, with guests Trini Lopez, Paula Wayne, and Corbett Monica. As much as critics hated the premiere episode, they loved the February 11 episode. Further episodes of The Sammy Davis Jr. Show also received good reviews. What is more, the show featured an all-star line-up of guests, including The Supremes, Tom Jones, Judy Garland, Peter Lawford, Diahann Carroll, Mel Torme, and yet others.Unfortunately, while critics loved The Sammy Davis Jr. Show, the show was faltering in the ratings. The Sammy Davis Jr. Show had received incredible ratings on its premiere, ranking ninth for the week. Sadly, the television audience may have had the same reaction to the premiere as critics and simply did not tune back in. It probably did not help that it aired opposite Hogan's Heroes (which would rank 9th for the year) and Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. (which ranked no. 2 for the year) on CBS. By February 21 1966, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show had dropped to 100 in the Nielsen ratings. It was in March 1966 that NBC put out its fall schedule, with The Sammy Davis Jr. Show conspicuously missing. Having failed in the ratings, the show was cancelled. In reaction to the cancellation the NAACP picketed NBC and even promoted a letter writing campaign, but in the end The Sammy Davis Jr. Show remained cancelled. While it might be tempting to chalk the cancellation of The Sammy Davis Jr. Show to racism, it seems likely any show that received ratings that low would be cancelled. The following season The Tammy Grimes Show on ABC was cancelled after only four episodes after similarly disastrous ratings.In February 1966 a studio album The Sammy Davis Jr. Show was released to take advantage of the new variety show. It was a collection of recording from five different recording sessions from 1961 to 1966. It proved more successful than the television show it was named for, receiving good reviews and selling quite well.Sadly, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show is not widely available. It has never been released on VHS or DVD. The only way to watch the show currently is at the Paley Centre for Media, which has every episode except two.While it only lasted briefly and did poorly in the ratings, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show would be historic as one of the earliest variety shows hosted by an African American. Despite its failure, it paved the way for further variety shows with Black hosts. It would be around five years after The Sammy Davis Jr. Show ended its run that The Flip Wilson Show debuted. Unlike The Sammy Davis Jr. Show, The Flip Wilson Show would prove to be a success, topping the ratings in its first season."},

{"title": "The Late Great Raquel Welch", "date": "Thursday, February 16, 2023", "text": "I have known who Raquel Welch was my entire life, well before I ever saw any of her movies. Such was Raquel Welch's level of stardom in the late Sixties and the Seventies that everyone knew who she was, even if they had never seen anything she had done. She was more than simply a movie star. She was the sex symbol of the era. I don't think there has been a sex symbol quite as popular ever since. Of course, while Raquel Welch was a sex symbol, she was also a very talented actress. I learned this when I was still a lad and I saw Fantastic Voyage (1966), The Three Musketeers (1974), and The Four Musketeers (1975) for the first time. She may have been best known for her looks, but Raquel Welch could act. Sadly, Raquel Welch died yesterday at the age of 82 after a short illness.Raquel Welch was born Jo Raquel Tejada in Chicago on September 5 1940. Her father came from Bolivia. She was only two years old when her family moved to San Diego, California. Miss Welch had wanted to be a performer since she was very young. She began studying ballet when she was seven, but stopped when she was ten years old. As a teenager she was winning beauty contests. At 14 she was named \"Miss Photogenic.\" She was later named Miss La Jolla, Miss San Diego, and Maid of California.She won a scholarship at San Diego College, where she studied drama, but eventually dropped out. She married her high school sweetheart, James Welch. The marriage only lasted a few years. In 1960 Raquel Welch got a job as a weather girl at KFMB in San Diego. It was in 1963 that she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. It was not long before she was landing parts. She made her film debut in A House is Not a Home in 1964. She made her television debut as a Billboard Girl on the variety show Hollywood Palace that same year. She guest starred on the shows The Virginian, McHale's Navy, Bewitched, The Rogues, Wendy and Me, and The Bailey's of Balboa. She auditioned for the role of Mary Ann on Gilligan's Island. She also appeared in the movies Roustabout (1964), A Swingin' Summer (1965), and Do Not Disturb (1965).It was producer Saul David's wife who took notice of her and suggested that 20th Century Fox sign her. Miss Welch was signed to a seven year, non-exclusive contract to the studio. Amazingly enough, the studio suggested she use \"Debbie\" as her first name, something that Raquel Welch refused to do. She was cast in the science fiction movie Fantastic Voyage (1966). She was then loaned to Hammer Films where she made One Million Years B.C. (1966). The poster for the movie, featuring her in a fur bikini, caused a sensation. Between Fantastic Voyage and One Million Years B.C., Raquel Welch became a sex symbol almost immediately. In the late Sixties Raquel Welch appeared in the movies Shoot Louder...I Don't Understand (1966), Sex Quartet (1966), The Oldest Profession (1967), Fathom (1967), Bedazzled (1967), The Biggest Bundle of Them All (1968), Bandolero! (1968), Lady in Cement (1968), 100 Rifles (1969), Flareup (1969), The Magic Christian (1969), and Myra Breckinridge (1970). She guest starred as herself in an episode of Bracken's World. In 1970 her television special Raquel! aired on CBS. In the Seventies Miss Welch appeared in the movies Hannie Caulder (1971), The Beloved (1971), Fuzz (1972), Kansas City Bomber (1972), Bluebeard (1972), The Last of Sheila (1973), The Three Musketeers (1973), The Four Musketeers (1974), The Wild Party (1975), Mother, Juggs & Speed (1976), and Animal (1977). She guest starred on the TV shows Laugh-In, Cher, Saturday Night Live, The Muppet Show, and Mork & Mindy. Miss Welch appeared in the TV specials Really, Raquel and From Raquel with Love. She appeared in the TV movie The Legend of Walks Far Woman.In the Eighties Raquel Welch appeared on Broadway in Woman of the Year. She appeared in the TV movies Right to Die, Scandal in a Small Town, and Trouble in Paradise. In the Nineties Raquel Welch was a regular on the short-lived series Central Park West. She guest starred on the shows Evening Shade, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Seinfeld, and Spin City. She appeared in the TV movies Tainted Blood and Torch Song. She appeared in the movies Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult (1994), Chairman of the Board (1998), and What I Did for Love (1998). She appeared on Broadway in Victor/Victoria.In the Naughts Miss Welch had a recurring role on the TV series American Family and a regular role on Welcome to the Captain. She guest starred on 8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter. She appeared in the movies Tortilla Soup (2001), Legally Blonde (2001), and Forget About It (2006). In the Teens she had a regular role on the TV series Date My Dad. She guest starred on the show CSI: Miami. She appeared in the TV movies House of Versace and The Ultimate Legacy. She appeared in the movie How to Be a Latin Lover (2007).I always thought, perhaps because of her status as a sex symbol, Raquel Welch was underrated as an actress. Indeed, she had a particular gift for comedy. Her comic talent was on display as the title character in the spy comedy Fathom. And she proved to have a gift for slapstick in both The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers, playing the beautiful but clumsy Constance de Bonacieux. On the family drama American Family she provided much of the show's humour as Aunt Dora, the family's drama queen who had almost become a star. When it came to comedy Raquel Welch had both a gift for delivering lines and a knack for slapstick. She really was underutilized when it came to comedies.Of course, Miss Welch was nothing if not versatile, and she may well have been the first major sex symbol who was also an action star. In 100 Rifles she played Native American revolutionary Sarita. In Bandolero! she played the widow of a man who was killed by outlaws, who also happens to be very good with a gun. In Hannie Caulder she played the title character, whose husband is murdered by a gang. She hires a bounty hunter to train her to use a gun in order to avenge her husband and herself. As good as Miss Welch was as a comic actress and action star, she was also good at drama. In Kansas City Bomber, she played K.C. Carr, a singer mother who makes her living in the world of roller derby. In the TV movie Right to Die she played a woman suffering from Lou Gehrig's Disease. In Scandal in a Small Town she played a mother who fights anti-Semitism in a small town. Raquel Welch was extremely versatile, being able to play everything from a scientist in Fantastic Voyage to a cavewoman in One Million Years B.C. to an alcoholic actress in the TV adaptation of Torch Song, She may have been incredibly sexy, but Raquel Welch was much more than a sex symbol."},

I have to admit that I am not one of them, and I have am a bit disappointed that it has fallen during my birth month the past many years. For one thing, the 31 Days of Oscar pre-empt TCM's usual programming, such as Noir Alley and Silent Sunday Nights. For another, it has generally been the month that TCM has shown the fewest of my favourite films. Fortunately, this year seems to be a bit better, with TCM showing several of my favourite movies. This year TCM is organizing the films shown during the 31 Days of Oscar by genre, so that there are blocks of sci-fi movies, gangster movies, and so on.

{"title": "The Flaming Hot...Five Reasons Why Tag", "date": "Monday, February 13, 2023", "text": "Many years ago Ruth of Silver Screenings and Maedez of A Small Press Life held the \"Reel Infatuation Blogathon,\" wherein one wrote about their big screen crushes. It was a few years ago that Gill of RealweegieMidget Reviews and Cat from Thoughts All Sorts, drawing inspiration from the \"Reel Infatuation Blogathon,\" came up with the \"Five Flaming Hotties\" tag, in which one wrote about five of their on-screen crushes. Last year Gill and Cat came up with a variation on this tag, in which one not only lists five of their crushes, but five reasons why they are crush-worthy. It is this final \"Flaming Hot...Five Reasons Why\" tag that this post deals with.Without further ado, then, here are the rules from Gill and Cat...1. You must add the name of the blog that tagged you AND those of the Thoughts All Sorts and Realweegiemidget Reviews with links to ALL these sites.. and use the natty cat themed picture promoting this post. This picture is found later in this post… 2. List 5 of your all-time swoon-worthy characters from TV or Film ie crushes/objects of your affection. And also do mention the actor or actress who plays them, as you might like James Bond as played by Timothy Dalton and no one else.. etc etc3. Link to 10 other bloggers.4. Add lovely pictures, gifs or videos of those you selected.5. If you don’t have a blog (or don’t have time to write a post) join in with your choices on Twitter with this #5TheFlamingHot5ReasonsWhy Tag and tag @realweegiemidge and @Thoughtsallsort  and the person who tagged you in your tweet.6. Oh…and post these rules.And now for my five Flaming Hotties. It will probably come as no surprise to many of you that four of my five hotties are played by the same actress. Vanessa Marquez was both my dearest friend and the girl of my dreams. I had a crush on Wendy on ER when the show first aired, years before I ever met Vanessa. And to be honest, characters played by her could have filled all five spots, but I could not think of five reasons why for the receptionist at the Cuban mission at the United Nations in the Seinfeld episode \"The Cheever Letters,\" beyond she's pretty (of course, she is--she's played by Vanessa) and has a sexy voice (of course, she does--she's played by Vanessa). Despite \"The Cheever Letters\" being one of the most popular things Vanessa ever appeared in, she's only in it for about two minutes!  Anyhow, here are my five Flaming Hotties.Nurse Wendy Goldman (Vanessa Marquez) from ERHottie's Story: In the first season Wendy was a student nurse in the emergency room of County General Hospital in Chicago. In the second and third seasons she appears to be a full-fledged nurse. 5 Reasons Why1. Wendy was very intelligent. In \"Luck of the Draw\" she corrects Dr. Lewis when she instructs Wendy to give a patient 350 milligrams of dopamine instead of 350 micrograms. Even as a student nurse, Wendy already knew a good deal about medicine. 2. Wendy was very sweet and very caring. She showed concern for her patients as well as her fellow employees. In \"Make of Two Hearts\" she holds a train victim's hand, only to have her had broken by the patient.  In \"Night Shift\" she expresses concern for Dr. Weaver after a clock falls off  the wall and hits Weaver in the head.3.  Wendy could bake and make candy. In \"Hell and High Water\" she baked cookies and in \"\"No Brain, No Gain\" she made salt water taffy. Not only was Wendy sweet, but she liked making sweet things.4, Wendy has a good sense of humour and enjoys having fun. In \"Blizzard,\" when the ER is slow, she rollerblades through the hospital. In \"Hell and High Water\" she appears to be very good at the video game Doom. She almost always takes part in desk clerk Jerry's (Abraham Benrubi) antics.5, Wendy appears to be a classic film buff. In \"Last Call\" she describes a friend of a patient as  a combination of Dennis Quaid, Robert Redford, and James Dean. Of course, Vanessa was a classic movie fan in real life and one of the original members of TCMParty, the group of fans who live tweet to movies on TCM using that hashtag. Wanda Hernandez (Vanessa Marquez) from Fire & Ice (2001)Hottie's Story: Wanda Hernandez is an employee at Holly Aimes (Lark Voorhies) and Pam Moore's (Tempest Bledsoe) high-tech security firm. According to the book upon which the BET television movie was based, Wanda was the firm's head technician.5. Reasons Why1. Wanda would have to be reasonably intelligent to be a technician at a high tech security firm. Indeed, in the film she accompanies Holly when they visit the home of Michael Williams to find out why his alarms are constantly going off. Here I must say it is a bit amusing that Vanessa played a technician at a security firm. Although she was very intelligent, in real life Vanessa was not particularly adept with technology. I had to walk her through things related to technology more than once. 2. Wanda is a romantic. Along with Pam she seems to be determined for Holly to get together with Michael.3. She has a very good sense of humour, and along with Pam provides much of the humour in the film.4. She looks really good in sweaters and skirts. Sweaters seem to be her favourite thing to wear. 5. She has a very sexy, very feminine voice.Violetta (Vanessa Marquez) in State of Emergency (1994)Hottie's Story: Violetta is the radiologist in an emergency room at a hospital in an unnamed city in the HBO movie State of Emergency.5 Reasons Why1. As a radiologist Violetta is both educated and intelligent. Not only would she have to had attended several years of college to become a radiologist, but she would have had to pass exams to do so too.2. Violetta shows real concern for her patients, even when her own patience is being tested (in the movie the CAT scan at the hospital is broken down).3. Violetta works very well with the doctors at the hospital, even when she is having to deal with a broken CAT scan. She seems fairly relaxed even when things are going wrong.4. Violetta has incredible, long, brown, curly hair. 5. She has a very sexy, very feminine voice.Janice Ramos (Vanessa Marquez) on Malcolm & EddieHottie's Story: Janice is a cocktail waitress at the Fifty/Fifty Club owned by Malcolm McGee (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) and Eddie Sherman (Eddie Griffin)5 Reasons Why1. Janice will stand up for her friends and employers. When the employees of the Fifty/Fifty Club go on strike, Malcolm and Eddie's use of scabs goes so badly that the customers riot. When the Fifty/Fifty Club employees realize the club is being torn apart, Janice is the first one to jump into the fray in an attempt to stop the riot. 2. Janice is very sweet. When Malcolm and Eddie announce that the prize for the Employee of the Week has been cut from $100 to $50 the other employees complain, but Janice says that she thinks $50 is enough.3. Janice is a very good worker. She wins the Employee of the Week prize, although admittedly part of that may be because she was fine with winning $50 instead of $100. 4. Janice has gorgeous, long dark hair.5.  Janice has a very sexy, very feminine voice (I know you might be tired of that one, but I loved Vanessa's voice).Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) on The AvengersHottie's Story: Emma Peel was born Emma Knight, the daughter of industrialist Sir John Knight. When Sir John died, she took over control of Knight Industries. She married test pilot Peter Peel, who was later presumed dead in a plane crash. Sometime after Peter Peel's disappearance, she joined John Steed (Patrick Macnee) in his ongoing battle against the various diabolical masterminds who threatened Britain and the world. 5 Reasons Why1. Mrs. Peel is very intelligent, able to grasp everything from literary references to scientific principles. This comes in useful given the nature of the opponents she and Steed usually face.2. She is self-sufficient and in no need of a man to come to her rescue her. More often than not she extricates herself from situations rather than have Steed save her.3. She is a skilled combatant who knows karate, kung fu, fencing, and a good number of other martial arts. She can easily take out multiple opponents, even when they are men larger than her.4. She has impeccable fashion sense. Mrs. Peel was on the cutting edge of fashion in the Sixties. This should come as no surprise, as her fashions were designed by such names as John Bates and Frederick Starke.5. Emma Peel is loyal to her friends. At times she has to come to Steed's rescue, and the two work well together. It is little wonder Steed appears to be smitten with her.About that whole nomination thing...This tag is over a year old and I have to think most people who are inclined to do it have already done so. I am then going to say that if you haven't done it yet, then go ahead and do so!"},
{"title": "Destination Freedom", "date": "Saturday, February 11, 2023", "text": "Journalist RicahardDurham African Americans were not exactly invisible on Old Time Radio. Black performers regularly appeared on the variety shows of the era and African Americans were regulars on various radio shows. At the same time, there were very few shows that starred Black performers or that were centred on the Black experience. An exception was a short-lived show that aired on WMAQ in Chicago. In its early days Destination Freedom aired biographies of important African Americans, from historical figures such as Harriet Tubman and George Washington Carver to more recent celebrities such as Lena Horne and Satchel Page. Destination Freedom was created by Richard Durham, a Black journalist who had written for New Masses, the Chicago Defender, the Chicago Star, and the Illinois Standard, in cooperation with the Chicago Defender. Richard Durham's goal with the show was to dispel many of the stereotypes about African Americans through an accurate portrayal of Black history and the Black experience. Hugh Downs served as the announcer on the series, while Studs Terkel provided many of the voices of the characters on the show. In its early days it featured many Black peformers The show would open with the spiritual, \"Oh, Freedom.\"Destination Freedom debuted on June 27 1948 and aired on Sunday mornings. Its first episode dealt with Crispus Attucks, the whaler, sailor, and stevedore who was the first person killed in the Boston Massacre. Over the course of 1948 Destination Freedom dealt with such subjects as Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Langston Hughes, Jackie Robinson, Duke Ellington. In 1949 it dealt with such subjects as Hazel Scott, Jesse Owens, W.E.B. Dubois, Canada Lee, Booker T. Washington, Satchel Page, Lena Horne, Louis Armstrong, and Jean Baptiste Point du Sable. In 1950 it dealt with such subjects as the foundation of the Chicago Urban League, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Fats Waller, and Nat King Cole.Richard Durham regularly found himself at odds with the station's censors. An episode on Nat Turner, who led a slave rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia, in August 1831, was outright rejected. The censors edited the episode on Frederick Douglass so heavily that it would not filled the entire half hour of the show, and was the cuts were restored only after protest from Richard Durham and the African American cast. Destination Freedom received a good deal of acclaim. Both Adlai Stevenson, then governor of Illinois, and legendary radio producer Norman Corwin praised the show. It won an award from the Institute for Education by Radio at Ohio State University. Unfortunately, such praise could not save the show. The changing times, with the nation becoming more conservative in early Fifties, led to WMAQ withdrawing their support of Richard Durham. Richard Durham, who had not made any money from Destination Freedom, took a job with Don Ameche, writing material for the performer.This was not the end of Destination Freedom. although the show as it continued might as well have been a different show. After being off the air since July 16 1950, Destination Freedom returned on October 15 1950. Its focus was no longer on Black history and the Black experience, but now on more generalized themes dealing with freedom in America. It ultimately ended its run on June 23 1951.Destination Freedom was not simply unique in being written by a Black journalist and featuring a largely African American cast. It dealt with events from Black history and other aspects of the Black experience at a time when it was often controversial to do so. The show certainly did not shy away from an accurate portrayal of racism in the United States, either in the past or in the present. Unfortunately, much of the United States was not ready at the time for such discussion, something that played a role in its change in format. In the end, Destination Freedom was a pioneering show that examined topics rarely, if ever, explored by other radio shows of the time."},

The changes in our temperatures are wreaking havoc with my sinuses. For that reason, in lieu of a full post, I will leave you with a song. Although it was never released as a single, \"Dangerous Type,\" from the album Candy-O, has long been my favourite song by The Cars. I have always suspected it was about the Mona Lisa, given the reference to \"museum directors\" trying to \"crack your crossword smile.\" Even if it isn't, it is a great song."},
{"title": "Cooley High (1975)", "date": "Thursday, February 9, 2023", "text": "When people think of Black cinema in the Seventies, they might be inclined to think of such Blaxploitation movies as Shaft (1971), Super Fly (1972), and Coffy (1973). While Blaxploitation movies might have dominated cinemas in the early to mid-Seventies, they were not the only Black movies being made. Cooley High (1975) is a coming of age movie set in Chicago in 1964 and has more in common with American Graffiti (1973) than Black Belt Jones (1974).Cooley High (1975) centres on Preach (Glynn Turman), a young, aspiring writer growing up in the Near-North Side of Chicago, where he attends the real-life  Edwin Gilbert Cooley Vocational High School. The movie follows the lives of Preach, his best friend Cochise (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs), and his other friends as they try to navigate high school and their lives in general. Beyond Preach's dream of becoming a writer, Cooley High does not have a central plot, but is instead more a collection of vignettes. As might be expected given it is set in 1964, Motown songs figure prominently in its soundtrack.Cooley High was based on the real life experiences of screenwriter Eric Monte. Eric Monte dreamed of becoming a writer, much like Preach in the film, and grew up in the  the Cabrini–Green housing project. He dropped out of high school in his junior year and enlisted in the United States Army. Once his service had ended, he hitch-hiked to Hollywood. Arriving there in 1968, he saw no success as a writer until one of his friends, actor Mike Evans was cast in the recurring role of Lionel Jefferson on All in the Family. Mike Evans persuaded Eric Monte to write a script that would expand his role as Lionel, and the script was accepted. He also co-created the sitcom Good Times. He would eventually sue CBS, Tandem Productions, producers Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio for misappropriating his ideas for The Jeffersons and Good Times. It was while Eric Monte was contributing dialogue to the animated film The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat (1974) that the film's producer Steve Krantz encouraged Mr. Monte to write a screenplay based on his experiences in Chicago. In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, he said that he wrote the screenplay to dispel misconceptions about growing up in the projects.  The resulting screenplay would be picked up by American International Pictures (AIP). Michael Schultz, who had directed the movies Together for Days (1972) and Honeybaby, Honeybaby (1974), was hired as the director of Cooley High.As might be expected of a movie produced by AIP, Cooley High was shot on a limited budget and in a brief amount of time. It was budgeted at $750,000 and its shooting schedule was 25 days. Cooley High was shot at real-life locations in Chicago, including the Cabrini-Green Public Housing Projects, Lincoln Park Zoo, and Providence-St. Mel High School. Cooley High proved to be a success. It received largely positive reviews and made $13 million at the box office. This success would lead to ABC planning a TV show based on the movie. ABC was not happy with the pilot, and it was retooled as the sitcom What's Happening!!. While Cooley High was set in 1964, What's Happening!! was set in the present day.Much of the success of Cooley High may have been due to a nostalgia craze that lasted for much of the Seventies. While many people associate the Seventies nostalgia craze with nostalgia for the Fifties, it actually included other eras as well, among them the Twenties (the movie The Great Waldo Pepper), the Depression (the TV show The Waltons), and the post-war years (the TV show Ellery Queen). Among these eras that the Seventies nostalgia craze included was the early to mid-Sixties. American Graffiti (1974), Cooley High, and Animal House (1978) were all set in this era.Of course, most of the success of Cooley High may have been that it was an utterly unique movie. In the Seventies movies centred on Black families or on Black teenagers were unknown. One almost never saw a film set in the projects, let alone one that treated the projects somewhat positively. Cooley High was then a singular film in that it dealt with Black teenagers growing up in the projects in 1964 in a sensitive, non-sensationalistic fashion. It is notable that Sounder (1972), which centred on Black sharecroppers in the Thirties, also met with success. Well done films about the Black experience were nearly non-existent in the Seventies, so that when one came out it was bound to find an audience.Cooley High is a very well done movie. Eric Monte's script captures 1964 Chicago with sympathy and thoughtfulness. Michael Schultz's direction captures the energy of both the era and its young protagonists. The cast delivers great performances throughout the film, a remarkable feat given many of them were inexperienced (for Cynthia Davis, who played Preach's love interest Brenda, Cooley High was her first and last time in front of a camera). Together the script, direction, and acting give us characters we can care about, characters we can sympathize with, and even characters one can identify with. If Cooley High was a hit upon its release and continues to be popular, it is because it gave us characters that audiences can truly love."},

It was in 2018 that he reprised his role as Jim Dial on the revival of Murphy Brown.Charles Kimbrough consistently gave great performances as Jim Dial on Murphy Brown, and it is shocking that he was nominated only once for an Emmy for the role. He should have not only been nominated many more times, but he should have won. Of course, he played many other roles besides Jim Dial. He had a highly successful career on Broadway, and made various guest appearances on television shows. In animated projects he played everything from the gargoyle Victor The Hunchback of Notre Dame to bumbling network executive Sandy Dreckman on the Pinky and the Brain episode \"You'll Never Eat Food Pellets in This Town Again!.\" Charles Kimbrough was wonderful actor with great deal of versatility."},

She also appeared in the movies Bound for Glory (1976), Slap Shot (1977), F.I.S.T. (1978), and The Muppet Movie (1979). She guest starred on the shows The Jeffersons and Sara. She appeared on Broadway in Ovid's Metamorphoses.In the Eighties Melinda Dillon played the mother in the holiday classic A Christmas Story (1983) and she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Absence of Malice (1981). She also appeared in the movies Songwriter (1984), Harry and the Hendersons (1987), Spontaneous Combustion (1989), Staying Together (1989), and Captain America (1990). On television she appeared in the mini-series Space. She guest starred on the TV shows The Mississippi, Insight, and The Twilight Zone.In the Nineties she appeared in the movies The Prince of Tide (1991), Sioux City (1994), To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar (1995), How to Make an American Quilt (1995), The Effects of Magic (1998), and Magnolia (1999). On television she appeared in the HBO movie State of Emergency, for which she was nominated for a CableACE award for Supporting Actress in a Movie or Miniseries. She guest starred on the TV shows The Client, Picket Fences, and Tracey Takes On.In the Naughts she appeared in the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation A Painted House. She guest starred on the TV shows Judging Amy, The Lyon's Den, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and Heartland. She appeared in the movies Cowboy Up (2001), Debating Robert Lee (2004), Adam & Steve (2005), and Reign Over Me (2007).Melinda Dillon was an enormous talent. I have no doubt she will probably always be best remembered for A Christmas Story. This is not merely because of the film's ongoing popularity, but because she was so very good as Ralphie's sweet, fun loving mother who was still willing to wash Ralphie's mouth out with soap for saying a word that definitely wasn't \"fudge.\" As iconic as Miss Dillon was in A Christmas Story, it is important to keep in mind that she played many, very different roles. She was lead character Tom Wingo's (Nick Nolte) suicidal sister Savannah in The Prince of Tides. In the HBO movie State of Emergency she was a woman who was overwrought at the death of her husband following an auto accident. In Absence of Malice she played Teresa Perrone, a devout Catholic who commits suicide after a newspaper story reveals she had an abortion. In To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar Miss Dillon played Merna, the operator of a beauty parlour who befriends the drag queens. Melinda Dillon was a wonderful actress who could play a wide variety of characters, from sweet, well-adjusted women to those bordering on a nervous breakdown."},

{"title": "Louise Harrison Caldwell, George Harrison's Older Sister, Passes On", "date": "Thursday, February 2, 2023", "text": "George & LouiseLouise Harrison Caldwell was never a household name, but her brother was. Her younger brother was none other than George Harrison, lead guitarist for The Beatles. Mrs. Caldwell played a pivotal role in the history of The Beatles, and was quite probably her brother's greatest admirer. Sadly, she died on January 29 2023 at the age of 91.Louise Harrison was born on August 16 1931 in Liverpool. She was the oldest of four children. It was in the Fifties that she married an American and moved to the North America. In 1963 she was living in the small town of Benton, Illinois with her husband. In September of that year George Harrison visited her in Benton. The two siblings hiked through the Garden of the Gods in Herod, Illinois  and George got to see his first movie in a drive-in theatre. He also bought a Rickenbacker guitar. He even performed with a local band, The Four Vets, at the VFW in Eldorado, Illinois, making George Harrison the first Beatle to perform in the United States.Louise Harrison Caldwell would be pivotal in spreading Beatlemania in the United States, even writing radio stations and record stores about her brother's band. She even toured with the band during the tours of the United States in 1964, 1965, and 1966. She would continue to promote her brother and The Beatles for the rest of her life. She made numerous personal appearances and give numerous interviews. In 2005 she formed The Beatles tribute band, Liverpool Legends, who perform in Branson, Missouri. A book on her experiences as the sister of a Beatle, My Kid Brother's Band a.k.a. The Beatles was published in 2016. Louise Harrison Caldwell spent much of her life living in either Illinois or Missouri, so it was not unusual to see her on the various local television stations from time to time. She was filled with various stories of The Beatles, which she would eagerly tell. She was obviously proud of her brother George, as well as the other Beatles. Those who met her remarked on her kindness. While Louise Harrison Caldwell was not as famous to her brother, she was well loved by Beatles fans."},
{"title": "The Late Great Cindy Williams", "date": "Tuesday, January 31, 2023", "text": "Cindy Williams, best known for playing Shirley Feeney on the classic sitcom Laverne & Shirley, and who appeared in such movies as American Graffiti (1973) and The Conversation (1974), died on January 25 2023 at the age of 75 following a brief illness.Cindy Williams was born on August 22 1947 in Van Nuys, California. She was only one year old when her family moved to Dallas, where they spent the next nine years. When Cindy Williams was eleven, her mother moved to the San Fernando Valley in California. She took an interest in acting while very young and acted in plays at Birmingham High School. She graduated from high school in 1965 and then attended Los Angeles City College, majoring in theatre. She worked as a waitress at the International House of Pancakes and later the nightclub the Whiskey A Go Go, where she served such music legends as Duke Ellington, Jimi Hendrix, and Joe Cocker. She signed with the the Paul Kohner Agency and made her television debut in an episode of Room 222 in 1969. She also guest starred on My World and Welcome to It and Barefoot in the Park. She made her movie debut in Gas! -Or- It Became Necessary to Destroy the World in Order to Save It in 1970. |In the Seventies she was one of the regulars on the short-lived sketch comedy program The Funny Side. It was in 1975 that she guest starred on Happy Days as Shirley Feeney. Cindy Williams guest starred alongside Penny Marshal as Shirley's roommate and best friend Laverne one more time before the two characters were spun off into their own series, Laverne & Shirley. During the decade she also guest starred on the TV shows Nanny and the Professor;  Room 222; Getting Together; Love, American Style; Hawaii Five-O; Cannon; Insight; Police Story; Petrocelli; Laugh-In; and CHiPs. She appeared in the movie American Graffiti (1973), for which she was nominated for the BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actress. She also appeared in the movies Drive, He Said (1971), Beware the Blob! (1972), Travels with My Aunt (1972), The Killing Kind (1973), The Conversation (1974), Mr. Ricco (1975), The First Nudie Musical (1976), and More American Graffiti (1979).Cindy Williams continued to appear on Laverne & Shirley in the Eighties. She also provided the voice of Shirley on the Saturday morning cartoon Laverne & Shirley in the Army and guest starred as Shirley in two more episodes of Happy Days. She guest starred on the shows The Billy Crystal Comedy Hour and The Wonderful World of Disney. She had regular roles on the shows Just Like Family and Normal Life. She appeared in the movies The Creature Wasn't Nice (1981), UFOria (1984), Big Man on Campus (1989), and Rude Awakening (1989).In the Nineties she starred on the shows Getting By, Strip Mall, and For Your Love. She guest starred on the shows Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, The Magic School Bus, Night Stand, Touched by an Angel, Hope & Gloria, and Girl Across the Lake. She appeared in the movies Bingo (1991) and Meet Wally Sparks (1997).In the Naughts Cindy Williams had a regular role on the show Drive. She guest starred on the shows Son of the Beach, The Brothers Garcia, 7th Heaven, Less Than Perfect, 8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter, Law & Order: Special Victims Order, and Girlfriends. She appeared in the movies The Biggest Fan (2005) and The Legend of William Tell (2006).In the Teens she guest starred on the shows Are We There Yet?, Sam & Cat, and The Odd Couple (2016). She appeared in the movies Stealing Roses (2012), Waiting in the Wings: Still Waiting (2018), and Canaan Land (2020). She will appear in the Amazon Prime series Sami, set to debut in March.I believe it is certain that Cindy Williams will always be best remembered as Shirley Feeney. Aside from the continued popularity of Laverne & Shirley, she gave a great performance as the perky, always postive, yet senstive Shirley, in contrast to the great Penny Marshall as the tough as nails, outspoken Laverne. As good as Cindy Williams was as Shirley, it is important to remember she played many other roles throughout her career. She gave an excellent performance as Ann in The Conversation, the woman that surveilance expert Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) has been assigned to spy upon. She also gave a great performance as Laurie in American Graffiti. She was very funny in UFOria, playing a religious grocery store clerk who belives in flying saucers. Cindy Williams played a wide variety of characters throughout her career.Cindy Williams was also a very kind, very nice human being. One of my friends is the biggest Laverne & Shirley fan in the world. She had the opportunity to chat with Miss Williams on Zoom and to meet her in person. Miss Williams could not have been nicer. She talked to my friend as if she had known her all her life and could not have been sweeter towards her. Miss Williams was funny, bright, and very vibrant. I don't think I have ever seen a celebrity treat a fan better. If I am a bit shocked by Cindy Williams's death, it's not simply because 75 seems like a young age to go, but because she seemed so youthful and very much still full of life."},
{"title": "Godspeed Lisa Loring", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2023", "text": "Lisa Loring, who originated the role of Wednesday Addams on the 1960s sitcom The Addams Family, died on January 28 2023 at the age of 64. The cause was complications from a stroke. Lisa Loring was born Lisa Ann DeCinces in Kwajalein Atoll, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (now the Marshall Islands). Her parents both served in the United States Navy, and divorced when she was very young. As a very young child she lived in Hawaii for a time before moving to Los Angeles to live with her mother. She was three years old when she began modelling, taking the stage name \"Lisa Loring.\" She made her television debut in 1964 in an episode of Dr. Kildare.It was also in 1964 that Lisa Loring was cast as Wednesday Addams on The Addams Family. Wednesday was an overly morbid six year old who owned headless dolls and kept pet spiders. The Addams Family only lasted two years, but proved to be a success as a syndicated rerun. In the Sixties she also played Suzy Pruitt on the short-lived sitcom The Pruitts of Southamptom. She also guest starred on The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. After The Pruitts of Southampton ended, Lisa Loring would not appear in television or films until the television reunion movie Halloween with the New Addams Family, in which she reprised her role as Wednesday Addams. In the late Seventies she guest starred on the TV shows Fantasy Island and Barnaby Jones. She appeared in the TV movie Annie Flynn. From 1980 to 1983 Lisa Loring had the recurring role of Cricket Montgomery on the soap opera As the World Turns. She appeared in the TV movie Gabe and Walker. She appeared in the movies Blood Frenzy (1987), Savage Harbor (1987), and Iced (1989). In the Teens she appeared in the movies Way Down in Chinatown (2014) and Doctor Spine (2015). It is safe to say that Lisa Loring will always be best remembered as Wednesday on The Addams Family. Aside from the show's continued popularity, I think it is primarily the case that she was so  good in the role. This is all the more remarkable given she was only five years old when she was cast and could not yet read. Someone had to read her lines to her and she memorized them that way. In interviews Miss Loring said that playing Wednesday was sometimes hard, because John Astin, Carolyn Jones, Jackie Coogan, and Ted Cassidy were all so funny, and yet she had to keep a straight face. In an interview at Monsterpalooza in 2017 she revealed that she was actually quite different from Wednesday, saying, \"I liked lace and pearls and pretty things and Wednesday liked everything dark and spooky.\" Certainly, Lisa Loring's portrayal of Wednesday has shaped every portrayal of the character since.And certainly Lisa Loring's portrayal of Wednesday Addams would have a lasting impact. I know many women who were inspired by Wednesday. Much of the message of The Addams Family, and Wednesday in particular, is that it is okay to be different, that it is okay not to conform to society's expectations of what you should be. In that respect, in some ways Wednesday could be considered a proto-feminist icon. While other little girls on television in the Sixties tended to conform to what was expected of them, Wednesday was very much her own person.In addition to being a talented actress, Lisa Loring was also a very nice person. She often attended conventions and other events, and everyone who had the privilege to meet her has said the same thing, that she was one of the nicest people one could ever meet. She certainly appreciated her fans. If many are sad today, it is not simply that Lisa Loring played a beloved character, it was because she was very much loved herself."},
{"title": "Alice Cooper on The Muppet Show", "date": "Sunday, January 29, 2023", "text": "(This post is part of  The Great Muppet Guest Star Caper hosted by Taking Up Room and Realweegiemidget Reviews)In the Sixties rock stars appeared on American television nearly every week. The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Lovin' Spoonful, The Doors, and others appeared on variety shows from The Ed Sullivan Show to The Jonathan Winters Show to The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. By the mid-Seventies this had changed and it was rare for rock stars to appear on television beyond such specialized shows as Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. The Muppet Show was then unique in that it actually guest starred the occasional rock star, among them Elton John, Paul Simon, Debbie Harry, and Alice Cooper. Alice Cooper guest starred on the seventh episode of the show's third season, the 307th episode of The Muppet Show over all. Alice Cooper began his career with the band of the same name. He was one of the pioneers of shock rock, with his stage shows featuring everything from an electric chair to a boa constrictor. Much of the imagery of Alice Cooper drew upon classic horror movies. The band first met with success with their third album Love It to Death. Their song \"School's Out\" would turn out to be a major hit in 1972, peaking at no. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and going all the way to no. 1 on the UK singles chart. It remains Alice Cooper's best known song. In 1975 Alice Cooper went solo with the album Welcome to My Nightmare. He proved to be a success as a solo act, with the hit singles \"Only Women Bleed\" (no. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100), \"You and Me\" (no. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100), and \"How You Gonna See Me Now\" (no. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100). Given how successful Alice Cooper was in the Seventies, not to mention his highly theatrical stage act seemed well suited to television, it was perhaps no surprise that he appeared on The Muppet Show. It should also be no surprise that his episode is reminiscent of Vincent Price's guest appearance on the show in its first season. That episode capitalized on Vincent Price's status as a horror movie legend, complete with Kermit turned vampire. The episode guest starring Alice Cooper capitalized on his status as \"the Godfather of Shock Rock,\" as he would eventually be called. Both episodes draw heavily on the mythos of horror movies.From the beginning Alice Cooper's guest appearance on The Muppet Show is humorously macabre. At the start of the episode he informs Scooter that the monsters in his dressing room don't belong to the Muppets, but to him. Early in the episode Alice reveals himself to be an agent of the Devil and offers the Muppets \"fabulous riches and worldwide fame\" in exchange for the souls. While Kermit rejects the offer, Miss Piggy does a trial run of the offer before deciding its not for her. Gonzo also wants to take the deal, but spends most of the episode trying to get a pen to sign the contract before he finally decides it isn't worth it.The running sketch in which Alice offers to buy the Muppets' souls is hardly the only part of the episode that deals with horror movie tropes. The whole episode does. The Muppet Labs invent a Germ Enlarger, inadvertently creating a gigantic germ that attacks Beaker. Fozzie is so freaked out by the creepy atmosphere of the episode that he takes refuge in the canteen with \"clean cut kids,\" only to learn that they are not \"clean cut\" at all. On the Pigs in Space segment, Link is suffering from some strange space disease. An attempt to cure him simply turns him into a mere outline of himself. As might be expected, Alice Cooper performs some of his songs on the episode. He performs \"Welcome to My Nightmare\" early in the episode, backed by The Vile Bunch (a group of monstrous Muppets). He sings \"You and Me\" to Beakie, who turns out to be Miss Piggy (who was transformed as part of the deal for her soul). Finally, Alice and some of the Muppet monsters perform \"School's Out.\"Here it must be pointed out that Alice Cooper's guest appearance on The Muppet Show marked the first appearance of Beakie, a bird-like, rainbow coloured monster. While in episode 307 she was simply a form Miss Piggy had been transformed into, she would later appear as an independent. background character in future episodes. Early in the episode Kermit remarks, \"Things weren't this spooky when Julie Andrews did the show.\" And while everyone I know (including myself) enjoyed Julie Andrews's guest appearance on The Muppet Show, I know there are a lot of us that loved Alice Cooper's guest appearance on the show as well, complete with its creepy atmosphere. Like Vincent Price's guest appearance on the show, it is a fun send up of horror movie tropes. The fact that one gets to hear three of Alice Cooper's most popular songs is an added bonus."},

{"title": "Stand and Deliver (1988) at the 2023 TCM Classic Film Festival", "date": "Wednesday, January 25, 2023", "text": "Vanessa Marquez as Ana Delgado in Stand and DeliverTurner Classic Movies has announced more films that will be shown at the 2023 TCM Classic Film Festival. Among them is Stand and Deliver (1988). The film, starring Edward James Olmos in the true story of math teacher Jaime Escalante, is being shown as part of the WB100 celebration at the festival. While Stand and Deliver (1988) was produced by American Playhouse, it was distributed by Warner Bros. Of course, regular readers of this blog know that Stand and Deliver (1988) has significance for me going beyond the fact that it has been one of my favourite movies ever since I first saw it in 1989. Quite simply, it marked the film debut of Vanessa Marquez, my dearest friend. Vanessa was cast after she answered an open casting call in the trade paper Dramalog, writing the casting directors and including her high school photo. She had to make a three hour bus trip from the fast food restaurant at which she worked to her audition for Stand and Deliver (1988), and then a three hour bus trip back. She was 19 at the time Stand and Deliver (1988) was filmed, and still very shy. Vanessa herself has said that she did not speak to anyone for the first two weeks of shooting. I am sure Vanessa would be happy that Stand and Deliver (1988) is being shown at the TCM Classic Film Festival. On the occasion of its 25th anniversary she campaigned to have it shown on Turner Classic Movies, and she wanted it shown at the film festival as well. I am sure she would be even happier to know that one of her favourite movies by one of her favourite directors, American Graffiti (1973), is also being shown at the festival.In addition to Stand and Deliver (1988) and American Graffiti (1973), TCM will also be showing such films as Casablanca (1942), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), Enter the Dragon (1973), Footlight Parade (1933), House of Wax (1953), Ikiru (1952), The Red Shoes (1948), Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), and Shadow of a Doubt (1943), among other films."},
{"title": "The 30th Anniversary of Twenty Bucks (1993)", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2023", "text": "It was thirty years ago today that the movie Twenty Bucks (1993) premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Unfortunately, Twenty Bucks (1993) never received a wide release. Fortunately, it was released on VHS. It was also shown on such premium cable channels as Bravo (then a premium channel), Cinemax, HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel. Still later it would be released on DVD. Ultimately, it would become a cult film. Much of the reason it achieved cult status may well be its cast, which includes Brendan Fraser, Elisabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd, and Steve Buscemi. Among the cast was my dearest friend Vanessa Marquez, only a little over a year before she began her stint on ER.Twenty Bucks (1993) is a portmanteau film in which many of the various stories overlap. It follows a twenty dollar bill, from its arrival at a bank via armoured car and the various people who come into possession of it to its ultimate demise. Among those people who have the bill for a time is a homeless woman who wants to win the lottery (Linda Hunt), a young man about to marry the boss's daughter, (Brendan Fraser), the owner of a new age shop (Gladys Knight), an underage boy wanting to buy wine (Kamau Holloway), a well-mannered armed robber (Christopher Lloyd), and so on. In many ways it resembles such portmanteau films as If I Had a Million (1932), Tales of Manhattan (1942), and Dead of Night (1945). The origins of Twenty Bucks (1993) go back nearly sixty years before it was released. Screenwriter Endre Bohem had written the film  Desert Nights (1929) and would go onto write the film  The House of a Thousand Candles (1936). Still later he would serve as a story consultant and writer on the classic television Western Rawhide. He had seen the portmanteau film If I Had a Million, in which a dying millionaire left his fortune to eight total strangers. Endre Bohem thought it would be more interesting to follow a smaller denomination of money pass through the hands of various people. It was then in 1935 that he wrote what would become the first draft of Twenty Bucks (1993). It was in the Eighties that Endre Bohem showed the screenplay to his son Leslie Bohem. Leslie Bohem .had been the bassist for the rock band Sparks, but left the band to pursue writing. Leslie Bohem liked his father's screenplay and thought that it would make for a good movie. He then decided to resurrect his father's screenplay. Ultimately, both father and son would share the screeenplay's writing credit.Karen Murphy, who had produced such films as This is Spinal Tap (1984) and Drugstore Cowboy (1989), agreed to be the film's producer. She approached veteran documentary filmmaker Keva Rosenfeld to direct the film. According to an article in Pop Matters, he decided to direct the movie because \"... it was finally a film I wouldn't mind paying to see.\" As to why they decided upon a $20 bill rather than some other amount, according to Keva Rosenfeld in the same article, \"We chose a 20 because in these times it could represent food money for a homeless person for a week or simply tip money for somebody in a restaurant.\" It would take some time before the script for Twenty Bucks would result in a movie. According to an October 17 1993 article in The Los Angeles Times, Endre Bohem's original script went through several rewrites and even a Sundance Workshop before being \"scrapped as being too dated.\" The final script would depart from Endre Bohem's original script. In both Endre Bohem's original script and his son's rewrite, each story was self-contained, with little to connect them beyond the $20 bill. It was Keva Rosenfeld who thought that the stories should overlap. Over the next two years he worked with screenwriter Leslie Bohem on 18 drafts of the screenplay.Ultimately, the stories in Twenty Bucks (1993) would overlap so that a character from one story might appear in another story. Melora Walters plays a stripper at a bachelor party held for Sam Mastrewski (Brendan Fraser), who later shows up as a funeral director. Mark (Noah Lee Margetts) is one of the participants at that same bachelor party. He shows up in a later story offering to buy wine for the underage character Melanie (Vanessa Marquez). Linda Hunt's character, Angeline is largely the thread that runs through much of the movie. She is the homeless woman who initially had the bill and goes throughout the movie trying to buy lottery tickets. Twenty Bucks (1993) was greenlit without a cast, a remarkable achievement given studios generally want a big-name star attached to a project before they will give the go-ahead. Nonetheless, Twenty Bucks (1993) would have one of the most remarkable casts of any film made after the Golden Age of Hollywood. Many in the cast were already well-known actors with highly successful careers, including Linda Hunt, Elisabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd, Steve Buscemi, Gladys Knight, and Diane Baker. Others would achieve stardom in the coming years. Among these were Brendan Fraser, William H. Macy, and David Schwimmer.As to how a low-budget, independent film like Twenty Bucks (1993) attracted such remarkable actors, much of it probably had to do with the sheer size of the cast. There were 46 speaking parts alone. For that reason a large number of actors auditioned for Twenty Bucks (1993). Often, when they did not get the role they wanted, they would simply take a smaller part. Another reason Twenty Bucks (1993) attracted well-known, established stars and up and coming actors alike is that it gave many actors a chance to play roles that they had never played before. Linda Hunt took the role of Angeline, the homeless woman initially in possession of the $20 bill, because she wanted to play a character who had been \"stripped of her authority.\" Then as now, Linda Hunt was known for playing authority figures. Elisabeth Shue took the role of aspiring writer Emily Adams because she had mainly played girls-next-door and girlfriends in big budget, Hollywood movies. Christopher Lloyd wanted to play the part of holdup artist Jimmy because the character was more lowkey than the previous characters he had played. While Jim Ignatowski on the TV series Taxi, Doc Brown in the Back to the Future trilogy, and many of his other characters were often zany and eccentric, Jimmy was quiet, reserved, and even urbane.Jimmy's fellow holdup artist and partner in crime in Twenty Bucks (1993) was Frank, played by Steve Buscemi. At the time Mr .Buscemi worried that he was being typecast in criminal roles, so he was initially resistant to playing Frank. It took Keva Rosenfeld some time to convince him to do the role. Ultimately he was happy he did take the part, as it was an altogether enjoyable experience and he got to play opposite Christopher Lloyd, with whom he had never worked before.As I said at the start of this post, among the large cast of Twenty Bucks (1993) was my dearest Vanessa Marquez, who played Melanie, the girlfriend of Bobby McComrac, an underage boy who wants to use the $20 bill to buy wine for their dinner. Vanessa never told me how she was cast in the film, but two of the three casting directors on the film (Richard Pagano and Sharon Bialy) were previously casting directors on Blood In Blood Out (1993), in which Vanessa played Montana's daughter. Appearing in Twenty Bucks was an altogether pleasant experience for Vanessa Marquez. She really enjoyed playing opposite Christopher Lloyd and Steve Buscemi, and she met most of the other actors working on the film. She also enjoyed working with the film's cinematographer, Emmanuel \"Chivo\" Lubezki (more on him in a bit). Twenty Bucks (1993) remained one of Vanessa's favourite projects that she ever did, and she absolutely loved the movie. She described it as \"a fun, sweet film.\"Twenty Bucks (1993) was filmed on location in Minneapolis, with interiors filmed in Los Angeles, as well as a few locations in LA for actors who could not travel to Minneapolis. Before settling on Minneapolis, the production team had looked at Houston, Dallas, St. Louis, and a few other cities. They wanted Twenty Bucks (1993) to be set in a large city so that the $20 bill could pass through the hands of a large variety of people. They also wanted it to be set in a classic American city that was not readily identifiable. Among the Minneapolis locations that appear in the film are Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, the 1000 block of West Broadway (where Jimmy and Frank meet), Willwerscheid & Peters Mortuary, and the Marquette Bank. Twenty Bucks (1993) was shot in 36 days. Because of the short amount of time allotted for filming the movie, Twenty Bucks (1993) was shot on a very strict schedule. The availability of the actors was always a concern, and scenes had to absolutely finished on time, not only because of the brief shooting schedule, but because one or more of the actors might not be available the next day. One major concern during the filming of Twenty Bucks (1993) was the \"star\" of the film, the $20 bill itself. In reality, multiple $20 bills were used throughout the filming of the movie. The production team got several bills with  consecutive serial numbers, as well as bills with the same first few digits and other bills with the same last few digits. This was done so that observant viewers could not tell that it was not the same $20 bill throughout the movie. For the sake of continuity, they had to keep track of how the $20 bill was \"marked up\" throughout the film (tyre tracks, coffee stains, blood, et. al.). According to Keva Rosenfeld, once they were finished with the bills, they would be put in the production's petty cash fund. In addition to actual $20 bills, they also used bills of various sizes to make shooting some scenes easier. For instance, some bills were much larger than an actual $20 bill.Money is certainly at the heart of Twenty Bucks (1993). It was production designer Joseph Garrity who came up with the idea of cluttering the city frames with references to money in the form of murals, advertisements, and so on. The references to money don't stop there. There are radio ads for the lottery, news reports on the stock market, and even a commercial featuring Kevin Kilner as lawyer Gary Adams (who just happens to be the brother of aspiring writer Emily Adams, played by Elisabeth Shue). As mentioned earlier, the cinematographer on Twenty Bucks (1993) was Emmauel \"Chivo\" Lubezki. Twenty Bucks (1993) was among his earliest American films. One can already see the hallmarks of Mr. Lubezki's style in Twenty Bucks (1993), from his use of practical lighting to his uncanny ability to frame shots and follow movement. It is largely because of Emmauel Lubezki's work on Twenty Bucks (1993) that the film actually looks more expensive than it actually was.As I already mentioned, Twenty Bucks (1993) premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. That original version was 100 minutes long. It would later be cut down to 91 minutes for its release. At Sundance it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize-Dramatic (it ultimately went to Public Access and Ruby in Paradise--that's right, it was a tie). Twenty Bucks (1993) would also be shown at other film festivals, including the Seattle Film Festival, the Edinburgh Film Festival, and the Deauville Film Festival, It was at the Deauville Film Festival that it won the critic's award. Twenty Bucks (1993) not only received recognition at film festivals. Christopher Lloyd won the Film Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male Actor for his role as Jimmy in Twenty Bucks (1993). Despite being well received at film festivals, Twenty Bucks (1993) had difficulty finding a distributor. Ultimately it would be picked up by Triton Pictures, a distribution company that had distributed Mindwalk (1990), A Brief History of Time (1991), Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1993), and various foreign films. It opened on October 22 1993 in New York City, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Unfortunately, it was while Twenty Bucks (1993) was in limited release, on December 7 1993, that Triton Pictures announced that they would be winding down their theatrical distribution by the end of the year. Ultimately, Twenty Bucks (1993) would never go into wide release.Fortunately, Twenty Bucks (1993) would not be relegated to obscurity. It was released on VHS by Columbia TriStar Home Video on June 1 1994. And, as mentioned earlier it aired on various premium cable channels. Even as it was in limited release, it opened the Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival on November 12 1993. Still later, it would be shown at the Austin Film Festival on October 10 1996. Twenty Bucks (1993) may have never received a wide release, but it would develop a cult following.As it was, Twenty Bucks (1993) was in some ways a historic film. Aside from School Ties (1992), it marked the first time Brendan Fraser played anything approaching a leading role. Twenty Bucks (1993) would also be the first independent film in which Elisabeth Shue appeared, this after having made several Hollywood movies. David Schwimmer who played Emily Adams's friend Neil, would become a household name only a year later on the TV show Friends. As mentioned earlier Twenty Bucks (1993) was one of the earliest American films on which cinematographer Emmanuel \"Chivo\" Lubezki worked, and his style is already evident in the film.In many respects, Twenty Bucks (1993) is very much a film from the Nineties. The film features nudity (the aforementioned Melora Walters's scenes as a stripper), a few instances of violence (none of it very graphic), one scene of drug use, and some strong language. At the same time, it feels as if it belongs to another era. In an already mentioned Los Angeles Times article on the film, both Leslie Bohem and Keva Rosenfeld say that they \"believe the final version is true to the spirit of the original.\" Legendary critic Roger Ebert agreed with them. In his review of the movie, he wrote, \"Some of the language and situations (like the stripper at the bachelor party) were no doubt not in the original version, but the spirit seems to come through unchanged.\" I have to say that I always agreed with Vanessa's summation of Twenty Bucks (1993). It is a sweet, fun film.Indeed, its script is one of its strong suits. Throughout the film there are references to fate and luck, which make even some of the most unlikeliest ways the $20 bill finds its way into various people's hands seem realistic. The characters are well written, so that even when they appear for only a few minutes they seem like fully realized human beings. Of course, much of that credit must go to the cast. Christopher Lloyd is chilling as Jimmy, a calm character who is much darker than the zany characters he had played before. Steve Buscemi, as Jimmy's more emotional partner Frank, also delivers an excellent performance. Both Brendan Fraser and Elisabeth Shue give admirable performances as young people who aren't exactly sure what they want to do with their lives. Even the supporting actors deliver fine performances. William H. Macy is superb as a police evidence locker clerk who is a bit bemused by his job. Melora Walters does a good job as the stripper who is unhappy with her life and then becomes a funeral director. And while I might be biased, I think my dearest Vanessa Marquez did a fine job as Melanie. Melanie is unlike earlier young characters she played. She is not shy and she is not studious. She is outgoing and is even willing to flirt in order to get wine for her and her boyfriend. Of course, beyond the script and the performances, Twenty Bucks (1993) is beautifully shot. Twenty Bucks (1993) is a remarkable film, one that, despite some of its content, seems as if it would have been more suited to the Thirties or Forties than the Nineties. Any one of its stories contain more substance than some entire movies. Twenty Bucks (1993) had difficulty finding a distributor and it never received a wide release, but somehow it became a cult film anyway. It is easy to understand why."},

{"title": "David Crosby Passes On", "date": "Thursday, January 19, 2023", "text": "David Crosby, best known for his work with The Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash, died today, January 19 2023, at the age of 81. David Crosby was born on August 14 1941 in Los Angeles. His father was cinematographer Floyd Crosby, who had worked on such films as High Noon (1952) and House of Usher (1960). David Crosby briefly attended Santa Barbara City College before he left the school to pursue a career in music. For a brief time he performed as part of a duo with soul, folk, and jazz performer Terry Callier in both Chicago and New York City. Around 1962 he performed with the folk group Les Baxter's Balladeers.It was in 1964 that David Crosby met folksingers Jim McGuinn (later taking the name \"Roger\") and Gene Clark. Mr. McGuinn had worked with The Limelighters and The Chad Mitchell Trio. Gene Clark had worked with The New Christy Minstrels. The three formed under the name The Jet Set and had their first recording sessions under that name. Bassist Chris Hillman and drummer Michael Clarke joined the group later in the year. As The Beefeaters they recorded the song \"Please Let Me Love You\" on Elektra Records. The single flopped.The Jet Set singed a recording contract with Columbia Records in November 1964. It was shortly thereafter that they renamed themselves \"The Byrds.\" Their first single, a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" went to no. 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK singles chart. Their first album, Mr. Tambourine Man, went to no. 6 on the Billboard album chart. The Byrds proved to be very successful, with such hit songs as \"Turn! Turn! Turn!,\" \"Eight Miles High,\" and \"Mr. Spaceman.\" Unfortunately, David Crosby and the other Byrds did not always get along. Tension between David Crosby and the other Byrds came to a head while recording The Notorious Byrd Brothers, and it was in October 1967 that he was fired from the band.It was about the time that David Crosby was fired from The Byrds that he met Stephen Stills, the former guitarist of Buffalo Springfield. The two began playing together. They were eventually joined by Graham Nash, who had decided to leave The Hollies. The trio formed Crosby, Stills & Nash and were soon recording for Atlantic Records. Their self-titled debut album was released in May 1969 and produced the hits \"Marakesh Express\" and \"Suite Judy Blue Eyes.\" They would be joined by Neil Young, another former member of Buffalo Springfield, and released their first album as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Déjà Vu in March 1970. It produced the hits  \"Woodstock\", \"Teach Your Children\", and \"Our House.\"Following  Déjà Vu, releases from Crosby, Stills & Nash could be years apart. CSN would not be released until 1977. Daylight Again would not come out until 1982. Neil Young rejoined the band for Crosby, Stills & Nash's 1988 album American Dream. Ultimately, they released eight albums in total.In between David Crosby and Graham Nash recorded as a duo, releasing the albums Graham Nash David Crosby in 1972, Wind on the Water in 1975, Whistling Down the Wire in 1976, and Crosby & Nash in 2004. David Crosby also released his own solo albums, the first being If Only I Could Remember My Name in 1972. It was followed by seven more solo albums. His last studio solo album was For Free, released in 2021. He also recorded with the band CPR, also known as s Crosby, Pevar & Raymond, a jazz rock fusion band formed with session guitarist Jeff Pevar and David Crosby's son keyboardist James Raymond. They released four albums from 1998 to 2001.David Crosby also had an acting career. He guest starred on such shows as Shannon's Deal, Roseanne, Flying Bird, The Simpsons, The John Laroquette Show, Ellen, and Chicago Hope. He appeared in the movies Backdraft (1991), Hook (1991), To Cross the Rubicon (1991), and Thunderheart (1992).David Crosby was an exceptional singer and there can be no doubt that his voice was responsible in part for the success of both The Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash. His voice had a fairly good range, and it was well suited to the harmonies for which The Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash were known. At the same time he was a very good stylist, able to change his voice to suit the song. David Crosby was a rock legend with good reason."},
{"title": "My Six Favourite Cary Grant Movies", "date": "Wednesday, January 18, 2023", "text": "Cary Grant was born today in 1904, so I thought today I would list my six favourite movies he ever did. Here I must point out that this list is not definitive. Except for North by Northwest and Arsenic and Old Lace it is very much subject to change. Cary Grant appeared in so many great films throughout his career that it is hard for me to make my mind as to which ones I like the best. Anyway, here is my list of six of my favourite Cary Grant films (at least for now).1.  North By Northwest (1959): This is not only my favourite Cary Grant film, but also my favourite Alfred Hitchcock film and one of my favourite movies of all time. Cary Grant is perfectly cast as Madison Avenue executive Roger Thornhill, who is mistaken by enemy agents for a spy who doesn't even exist. It is fun, action-packed, and the chemistry between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint is palpable. I have to think that North By Northwest may have spurred the spy craze that began in the United Kingdom with the TV shows Danger Man and The Avengers and spread to the United States through the James Bond movies. It certainly had an impact on the spy shows of the Sixties, particularly The Man From U.N.C.L.E.2. Arsenic and Old Lace (1944): For me Arsenic and Old Lace is the perfect Halloween film. Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) returns to his childhood home with his new bride (Priscilla Lane) on Halloween only to discover his maiden aunts' (Josephine Hull and Jean Adair) dark secret. Worse yet, his brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey), a well-known serial killer, shows up with his plastic surgeon (Peter Lorre). No, it isn't a horror movie (although it has a few scares), but an at times sweet natured black comedy. It is uproariously funny and very well acted.3. The Awful Truth (1937): I think Cary Grant may have been at his best in screwball comedies, and The Awful Truth is a prime example of the genre. A misunderstanding between Lucy Warriner (Irene Dunne) and Jerry Warriner (Cary Grant) results in divorce proceedings. As it turns out Lucy and Jerry discovered that staying apart isn't as easy as they though it was. The Awful Truth is hilarious, and features several moments that push the boundaries of the overly strict Production Code of the time. Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are wonderful together, and Irene Dunne remains my favourite of Cary Grant's leading ladies. They would appear together gain in by My Favourite Wife (1940) and Penny Serenade (1941). 4, The Bishop's Wife (1947): I think it is safe to say that the majority of classic film fans count The Bishop's Wife among the greatest Christmas movies of all time. It certainly has an excellent cast, including David Niven as Bishop Henry Brougham, Loretta Young as his wife Julia, and Cary Grant as Dudley, the angel sent to offer Henry guidance. The cast is filled out by Monty Woolley as Henry and Julia's friend Professor Wutheridge and Elsa Lancaster as their housekeeper Mathilda. The Bishop's Wife and warm without being too maudlin, altogether an inspiring movie.5. Bringing Up Baby (1938): This is among the greatest screwball comedies ever made. Mix in Cary Grant as a palaeontologist, Katharine Hepburn as the extremely free-spirited Susan Vance, and a leopard named Baby, and you have Bringing Up Baby. Even for the genre, Bringing Up Baby is fast paced and one might not catch all of them in one viewing. Even today the movie seems amazingly fresh.6. The Philadelphia Story (1940): The Philadelphia Story is often called a romantic comedy, but I think it might be better called a screwball comedy blended with a comedy of manners with a good deal of farce thrown in for good measure. Katharine Hepburn stars as socialite Tracy Samantha Lord, whose wedding plans are snarled up by the arrival of her ex-husband C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant). Matters are complicated further by the arrival of reporter Mike Connor (Jimmy Stewart) and his photographer Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey), who are supposed to cover Tracy's wedding. The Philadelphia Story is filled with witty dialogue, some great performances, and truly hilarious situations."},

{"title": "The Late Great Jeff Beck", "date": "Saturday, January 14, 2023", "text": "Jeff Beck, the guitar god known for his work with The Yardbirds and his solo work, died on January 10 2023 at the age of 78. The cause was bacterial meningitis.Jeff Beck was born on June 24 1944 in Wallington, Surrey, England. He was drawn to music from an early age and sang in a church choir when he was 10. He was 15 years old when he built his first guitar and then taught himself to play the instrument. He was influenced by such guitarists as Les Paul, Gene Vincent's guitarist Cliff Gallup, B.B. King, and Steve Cropper.Jeff Beck attended the Wimbledon College of Art. Afterwards he was employed in a variety of jobs. In 1963 he formed The Nightshift. The band recorded one single, a cover of T-Bone Walker's \"Stormy Monday, on the Piccadilly label. For a short time he was the lead guitarist for the Croydon band The Rumbles and later the Chiswick band The Tridents. He played as a session player on The Fitz and Startz's 1964 single \"I'm Not Running Away.\"It was in March 1965 that The Yardbirds recruited Jeff Beck as their lead guitarist to replace Eric Clapton. It was while Jeff Beck that The Yardbirds produced many of their hits, including \"Heart Full of Soul,\" Evil Hearted You,\" \"I'm a Man,\" and \"Shape of Things.\" It was in June 1966 that Jimmy Page temporarily took over as The Yardbirds' bassist following Paul Samwell-Smith's departure. He was bassist only until Chris Dreja could master the instrument. Once that happened, Jimmy Page became lead guitarist in tandem with Jeff Beck. Eventually Mr. Beck would be fired due to his often explosive temper and his perfectionism, as well as his tendency not to show up for concerts at times. Following his departure from The Yardbirds, Jeff Beck recorded singles for Mike Most in 1967. It was also in 1967 that he formed The Jeff Beck Group with vocalist Rod Stewart and rhythm guitarist Ronnie Wood. While the line-up would change from time to time, The Jeff Beck Group ultimately recorded four albums: Truth in 1968, Beck-Ola in 1969, Rough and Ready in 1971, and Jeff Beck Group in 1972. While it had been recorded in 1966 before The Jeff Beck Group formed, Jeff Beck's instrumental \"Beck's Bolero\" was included on the album Truth and became one of his most lasting successes. After the dissolution of The Jeff Beck Group, Jeff Beck formed Beck, Bogert & Appice with  bassist Tim Bogert, and drummer Carmine Appice. They released one album in 1973 before breaking up. Afterwards Jeff Beck would release twelve solo albums. He would also collaborate with other musicians, including Jeff Lieber on the 1992 album Frankie's House, the 1993 album Crazy Legs with The Big Town Playboys, and the 2022 album 18 with Johnny Depp. He also played on numerous songs with various artists, including \"Trudi\" on Donovan's album Barabajagal, Stevie Wonder's song  \"Lookin' for Another Pure Love\" on his album Talking Book,. Stanley Clarke's song \"Rock 'n Roll Jelly\" on the album Modern Man, and so on.I don't think anyone can argue that Jeff Beck wasn't one of the greatest guitarists of all time. His level of technical skill was greater than most of the guitarists of his time. Furthermore, he was versatile, able to play the blues, rock, jazz, classical, and yet other genres. It was not unusual for him to blend various types of music together. What is more, Jeff Beck was an innovator. It was while he was with The Yardbirds that he introduced audio feedback and distortion on the guitar to rock music. Much of his work, particularly the Jeff Beck Group album Truth, would have a lasting impact on heavy metal. Rock music would certainly sound different without Jeff Beck."},

She took an interest in acting after seeing her first stage production at age four. She graduated from Baylor University in 1945, where she studied Greek drama. She worked in regional theatre, and then went to New York. She made her Broadway debut in a revival of Threepenny Opera in 1954.

Miss Ball asked her to come to California to audition for the Desilu Workshop, Desilu's training program for young actors. She signed with Desilu and made her television debut in 1959 in the Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse episode \"The Desilu Revue,\" which highlighted many of Desilu's young performers (among them future TCM host Robert Osborne). In 1960 she appeared in two episodes of U.S. Marshal, a syndicated Western television series produced by Desilu. It was Lucille Ball who convinced her to use \"Carole\" as a stage name, after Carole Lombard whom Miss Ball admired.In the Sixties Carole Cook made several appearances on The Lucy Show, playing the recurring role of Lucy's friend Thelma Green, as well as other roles.

She appeared in the movies A Very Sordid Wedding (2017) and Waiting in the Wings: Still Waiting (2018).Carole Cook was an amazing actress. She had a particular gift for musical comedy, possessing a good voice and impeccable comic timing. She always enriched anything she was in, from playing flirty hotelier Naomi Yates in Palm Springs Weekend to the title character's nagging wife in The Incredible Mr. Limpet. She was a delight on television as well, whether it was in a recurring role like Thelma on The Lucy Show or a guest appearance like Laverne & Shirley. Carole Cook was truly a great talent."},

{"title": "Jack Carson: What a Character", "date": "Saturday, January 7, 2023", "text": "(This post is part of the 11th Annual What a Character! Blogathon hosted by Once Upon a Screen, Outspoken and Freckled, and Paula's Cinema Club)Like most character actors, Jack Carson was best known for playing a specific type of character, in his case affable fools who were often supporting characters in films. What set him apart from other character actors is that he played lead roles in several films. What is more, while he is best known for his comedic roles in films ranging from Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) to The Good Humor Man (1949), he also played supporting roles in such dramas as Mildred Pierce (1945) and A Star is Born (1954).Jack Carson was born on October 27 1910 in Carman, Manitoba, Canada. His family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin when he was only about four years old. His older brother was character actor Bob Carson, who appeared in a number of movies and television shows. Jack Carson became interested in acting when he attended Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. In fact, it would be a production at a college that would lead directly to his career. He was playing Hercules and stumbled, nearly taking most of the set. It occurred to one of his friends at the college, Dave Willock, that Jack Carson's sheer size (he stood 6' 2\") and his physicality would make for a good vaudeville act. The two then formed the comedy team of Willock and Carson, and proved to be a huge success on the vaudeville circuit. The team would eventually part ways, although Dave Willock and Jack Carson would work together again. Dave Willock was one of the writers on Jack Carson's radio program The Jack Carson Show, and also played the recurring role of Jack Carson's nephew Tugwell on the show. Dave Willock went onto his own career as a character actor, appearing in several films, working with Cliff Arquette (playing his character Charley Weaver) on the radio show Dave and Charley, and playing the title character's father on the sitcom Margie.Jack Carson would move from vaudeville to radio, first appearing as one half of Willock and Carson on  Kraft Music Hall when Bing Crosby in 1938. He hosted The Camel Comedy Caravan from 1942 to 1943 before starring on The Jack Carson Show from 1943 to 1949. The Jack Carson Show was much like The Jack Benny Program, insofar as it blended the variety show and sitcom formats. Jack Carson played himself, with the show focused on his home life as a star. From 1947 to 1948 he starred on the radio show The Sealcrest Village Store. Jack Carson actually appeared on film before he began his radio career, playing a bit part in You Only Live Once in 1937. Even so, his appearances on radio certainly helped his movie career. Initially signed to RKO, he found himself cast largely in bit parts in such films as Bringing Up Baby (1938) and Destry Rides Again (1939). It was after he signed with Warner Bros. that his career really began to take off. Indeed, in The Strawberry Blonde (1941) he played a role somewhat different from the affable buffoons for which he would become most familiar. He played Hugo Barnstead, a somewhat dishonest braggart who serves as the rival of the lead character Biff Grimes (played by James Cagney). He played a somewhat similar role in Love Crazy (1941), champion archer Ward Willoughby. He may well have been even less likeable as Leo Powell, the loud mouthed, egoistical trumpeter who is also singer Ginger Powell's (Priscilla Lane) husband in Blues in the Night (1941).Fortunately, Jack Carson would switch from somewhat unlikeable blowhards to amiable sidekicks and other supporting characters. In the 1942 movie Gentleman Jim he played the friend of the title character (historical figure Jim Corbett, played by Errol Flynn). He played somewhat similar roles in such films as Princess O'Rourke (1943).  It was during this period that he appeared in one of his best known roles, that of police officer and would-be playwright Patrick O'Hara in Arsenic and Old Lace (1944). It was also during this period that Warner Bros. developed what seemed like an unbeatable formula, teaming heart throb Dennis Morgan with Jack Carson.  Jack Carson played Dennis Morgan's amiable friend  in Wings for the Eagle (1942). In The Hard Way (1943) he played Dennis Morgan's business partner, while in One More Tomorrow (1946) he played Dennis Morgan's butler. It was Dennis Morgan and Jack Carson's rapport in One More Tomorrow that led to the movie Two Guys from Milwaukee (1946). Two Guys from Milwaukee was Warner Bros.' attempt to capture the same sort of success that Paramount had seen with the \"Road to...\" movies starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. With Two Guys from Milwaukee, Jack Carson no longer played Dennis Morgan's sidekick, but was instead his co-lead, much as Bob Hope was Bing Crosby's co-lead in the \"Road to...\" films. Two Guys from Milwaukee would be followed by two more films with Dennis Morgan and Jack Carson firmly in \"Hope and Crosby\"mode: The Time, the Place and the Girl (1946) and Two Guys from Texas (1948). Dennis Morgan and Jack Carson appeared one last time together in a movie in It's a Great Feeling (1949), in which they played themselves in a movie that today could be considered \"meta.\" All in all, Dennis Morgan and Jack Carson made eleven films together. The two men were very close. Upon Jack Carson's death from stomach cancer at age 52, Dennis Morgan described him as his \"best friend.\"While Jack Carson was the co-lead with Dennis Morgan in many films, he also played the lead in his own movies. The first film in which Jack Carson was clearly the lead actor was the comedy Make Your Own Bed (1944), in which he played an inept private eye who must pose as the butler in the estate of a wealthy couple. He was top billed in Love and Learn (1947), although arguably  his role in the film is yet another best friend and sidekick (in that case, to Robert Hutton). He certainly was not the sidekick in April Showers (1948), in which he played one of half of a married song and dance act with Ann Sheridan. He also played the lead in Romance on the High Seas (1948), now best known as Doris Day's film debut. With their next film together, My Dream is Yours (1949), Doris Day had graduated to leading lady status.Much like Make Your Own Bed, The Good Humor Man (1949) is definitely a Jack Carson vehicle. The film was meant to be a follow up to The Fuller Brush Man (1948) starring Red Skelton, with Jack Carson playing an incompetent Good Humor man who reads Captain Marvel comic books and is framed for a payroll robbery. Written by animator Frank Tashlin and directed by Lloyd Bacon, the film often plays like a live-action Warner Bros. cartoon. Following The Good Humor Man Jack Carson was the co-lead in a few more films.While Jack Carson was best known for comedy, he played dramatic roles as well. Indeed, among his best known roles is that of Wally Fay, the title character's friend and lovelorn suitor in Mildred Pierce. His previous film Roughly Speaking (1945), was also a drama. He played the faithful, yet careless husband of Rosalind Russell's character. In A Star is Born (1954) he played studio publicist Matt Libby.Of course, many of Jack Carson's films were musicals and he appeared as a supporting character in yet other musicals, including Dangerous When Wet (1953), Red Garters (1954), and Ain't Misbehavin' (1955). His only appearance on Broadway was in a musical, the 1952 revival of I Thee I Sing.Like many actors Jack Carson would move into television. From 1950 to 1951 he was one of four alternating hosts of Four Star Revue along with  Jimmy Durante and Ed Wynn, and Danny Thomas. He also had his own show, The Jack Carson Show, from 1954 to 1955. He appeared on several of the anthology series of the Fifties and Sixties, including Lux Video Theatre,General Electric Theatre, Climax!, Studio One, Playhouse 90, The United States Steel Hour, Thriller, The Twilight Zone, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. He also appeared in episodic television shows, including The Bob Cummings Show, Date with the Angels, Bonanza, and Bus Stop. His final appearance on screen was playing the lead in the two-part episode \"Sammy, the Way-Out Seal\" on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color.Sadly, Jack Carson died from stomach cancer on January 2 1963 at the age of 52. He left behind a legacy of great performances. While best known for playing affable buffoons, he could play other roles. In some of his roles he was not particularly likeable, such as Hugo Barnstead in The Strawberry Blonde and the big-headed Ward Willoughby in Love Crazy. In The Male Animal (1942) he played Joe Ferguson, former football star and rival to lead character Tommy Tucker (Henry Fonda). In The Tattered Dress (1957) he played the outright villainous Sheriff Hoak. And as pointed out, he excelled in drama as well as comedy, as demonstrated by Mildred Pierce, A Star is Born and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958).Of course, even given the other sorts of roles Jack Carson played, including dramas, it is probably as the loveable buffoons for which he is best remembered. Whether it was a supporting role such as the  hapless Officer O'Rourke in Arsenic and Old Lace or a lead role such as inept Good Humor man Biff Jones in The Good Humor Man,  Jack Carson had a flair for comedy. His gift for physicality and his perfect comic timing, particularly combined with his large size, made him the perfect comedic actor.  Indeed, his comic roles are so well remembered that I suspect the mere thought of Jack Carson brings smiles to most classic film buffs's faces."},
{"title": "Announcing The 9th Annual Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon ", "date": "Monday, January 2, 2023", "text": "It is that time of year when I announce the Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon. This will be the 9th Annual TV Show Episode Blogathon. The previous eight blogathons were successful, so it is back for another year.  For those unfamiliar with the Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon, it is a blogathon in which bloggers write entries about their favourite episodes of their favourite classic television shows. This year it will take place March 24, 25, and 26.Here are the ground rules:1. Posts in the blogathon must be about an episode from a scripted drama. Episodes of reality shows, talk shows, game shows, and variety shows are ineligible. That having been said, posts can be on episodes from any genre of scripted dramas: animated shows, anthology shows, detective shows, police procedurals, science fiction shows, situation comedies, and so on. I also have to say that episodes can be from scripted dramas that aired at any time of day. They don't have to be from prime time alone. If one wanted to write about his or her favourite episode from his or her favourite Saturday morning cartoon or daytime soap opera, one could.2. Because this blogathon is dedicated to classic television and I think a classic is something that must have stood the test of time, episodes must be from shows that are at least 25 years old. That means one cannot write posts on episodes from shows that debuted after 1998 (nothing from CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, let alone Abbott Elementary). Now here I want to point out that the episode itself does not have to be 25 years old, only the show on which it aired. Law & Order (the original, not the revival) debuted in 1990 and ran until 2010, so that its final season aired after 1998. Because Law & Order is over 25 years old, however, one could still write about an episode that aired in the 2009-2010 season.3. Given my love of British television, it should come as no surprise that posts do not have to be about episodes from American shows alone. Posts can be about episodes from any show from any country as long as the show is a scripted drama and debuted over 25 years ago. If you want to write about your favourite episode of The Saint, The Little Hobo, Jaianto Robo, or Escrava Isaura, you can.4.  I am asking that there please be no duplicates. That having been said, if someone has already chosen to cover \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" from The Twilight Zone, someone else could still write about another Twilight Zone episode.5. In keeping with ground rule no. 4, I am asking that if you participated in the past years' blogathons that you write about a different episode from what you did the past years. That having been said, you could write about an episode from the same show.  If you wrote about the Star Trek episode \"Amok Time\" last year, then you could write about the Star Trek episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\" this year.6. I am not going to schedule days for individual posts. All I ask is that the posts be made on or between March 24, March 25, or March 26 2023.7. On March 24 I will set up the page for the blogathon. I ask that you link your posts to that page.

{"title": "Goodbye, 2022", "date": "Saturday, December 31, 2022", "text": "Buster KeatonI have to be honest. In many ways 2022 was a rough year, but not necessarily an entirely bad one. More so than most years, it seemed as if we lost several beloved stars. The world of classic film blogging lost one of its most popular bloggers. As for myself, I lost my beloved cat Malcolm and then this month, December, I came down with the flu for the first time in years. Still, there were a few bright spots in the year, so that I cannot say that 2022 was all bad.Of course, many classic film bloggers are still grieving the loss of Patricia Nolan, known as Paddy Lee to her friends. Paddy wrote the blog Caftan Woman and was very prolific when it came to commenting on other classic film and television blogs. Her knowledge of classic movies and classic television was encyclopaedic. What is more, Paddy had a sunny disposition and could cheer up anyone, no matter how bad things may be going. She truly loved classic movies and classic TV shows, and she loved her fellow fans as well. She died on March 7 2022.My cat Malcolm died in September. He arrived on our porch as a kitten one hot summer day. He couldn't have been more than three months old. We kept him and he quickly became one of the family. He was possibly the most loving, most cuddly cat I ever had. He always slept with me and loved sitting on my lap. When Vanessa died, he would not leave my side, even as I was crying my eyes out. He loved being groomed and petted. I don't know that I ever loved any cat more than Malcolm, and I am still grieving him three months later.Of course, many celebrities died this year. Perhaps the most famous person to die was Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Regardless of what one thinks of the British monarchy, there is no denying the impact that she had on the United Kingdom and the world. The world of film also lost royalty this year. Sir Sidney Poitier died not long after 2022 began. Later in the year Dame Angela Lansbury died. The legendary Marsha Hunt also died this year. I cannot begin to list every actor that died this year, but here is a list of some that did. Please forgive me if I have left your favourite out, as so many actors died this year it is hard to include all of them. Any, here they are: Dwayne Hickman,  Howard Hesseman, Veronica Carlson, Robert Morse, Joe Turkel, Larry Storch, L. Q. Jones, Lenny Von Dohlen, David Warner, Nichelle Nichols, Bernard Cribbins, Paul Sorvino, Pat Carroll, Clu Gulager, Robbie Coltrane, and Robert Clary. We also lost the esteemed directors Peter Bogdonovich, Bob Rafelson, Jean-Luc Godard, and Mike Hodges. Many people from the world of music died this year, including Don Wilson of The Ventures, Bobby Rydell Ronnie Hawkins, Alan White of Yes, Andy Fletcher of Depeche Mode, Manny Carlton of Nazareth, Olivia Newton John, Dan Mcafferty of Nazareth, and Terry Hall of the Specials. The world of comic books lost legendary artists Neal Adams and George Pérez, as well as writer Alan Grant. Artist James Bama, known for the covers of the Bantam reprints of the Doc Savage novels, the illustrations on the boxes of Aurora's classic movie monster model kits, and Western art, also died this year.For once this year I actually watched new movies and new television shows. I watched  Guillermo del Toro's new adaptation of Nightmare Alley and I was impressed. I can't say it is as good as the 1947 adaptation, but it is almost as good. It was a very fine adaptation of the novel. I also watched Steven Spielberg's remake of West Side Story. West Side Story (2021) is a well done movie, although I do not think it is quite as good as the 1961 film, even with Latinos playing the roles of the Puerto Rican characters. I also watched The Batman (2022), which may be the best movie featuring the Caped Crusader short of The Dark Knight (2008). One of the things I love about the movie is that, unlike other Batman movies, we actually get to see Batman function as a director. The cast did an excellent job, with Robert Pattinson ranking among the best Batman actors in my opinion. Prey (2022) is the first Predator movie I have loved since the first. The movie is set in the 18th Century and features a young Comanche woman battling a predator. It treated the Comanche with dignity and, near as I can tell, was accurate to their culture.As far as television shows go, I got caught up on Reservation Dogs. The show is the first to have a writing and directing staff that is entirely Native American. It centres on four Native American characters living on a reservation in rural Oklahoma. The show is well written and notable for the accuracy with which it portrays life on a reservation. I also watched Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. It is the best new Star Trek series since Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (which itself was the best new Star Trek series since the original). It follows the adventures of Captain Pike, the captain of the Enterprise before Captain Kirk, and his crew (which includes a young Mr. Spock). They did a very good job of capturing the feel of the original series, and I must admit I am a big fan of Strange New Worlds.With regards to 2023, I will continue writing A Shroud of Thoughts, which will turn 19 this coming June. I also hope to get more books out next year. I am also hoping that 2023 will be better than 2022. I hope as few beloved celebrities die as possible, and I lose no dear friends or pets. I also hope your 2023 will be a happy one."},

It was released to the rest of the United States the following day, December 13 1972. The movie proved to be a huge hit at the box office. It would ultimately earned $42,000,000, making it the second highest grossing film of 1972 following The Godfather (1972). Hollywood certainly took notice of its success. Along with Airport (1970), it sparked the cycle towards all-star disaster films that dominated much of the Seventies. The song \"The Morning After\" from the film not only won the Oscar for Best Song, but a version of the song performed by Maureen McGovern went to no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.The Poseidon Adventure (1972) centred on the ageing luxury liner the SS Poseidon, which capsizes on New Year's Eve after an earthquake beneath the ocean. The Reverend Frank \"Buzz\" Scott (Gene Hackman) then has to lead a group of survivors to safety. Among the survivors are Detective Lieutenant Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine), singer Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley), store owner Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson) and his wife Belle (Shelley Winters), and yet others.The Poseidon Adventure (1972) was based on the 1969 novel of the same name by Paul Gallico. The novel was inspired by an experience Mr. Gallico had in 1937. He was going back to England from the United States aboard the Queen Mary when an enormous wave struck the ship and knocked it hard to port. Fortunately the Queen Mary righted itself and none of the passengers died. Still, the experience stayed with Paul Gallico, who eventually used it as inspiration for the novel The Poseidon Adventure.While the novel The Poseidon Adventure did not sell particularly well, Hollywood did take notice of producer Irwin Allen, then perhaps best known for such sci-fi television shows as Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and Lost in Space. He had signed a three movie deal with AVCO Embassy and convinced them to buy the rights to the novel. AVCO Embassy would ultimately cancel the project, Irwin Allen found another production company in 20th Century Fox. 20th Century Fox was nervous about what could be a very expensive movie, so Mr. Allen offered to raise half of the movie's budget. Additional money was provided by Steve Broidy, former president of Monogram Pictures, and cinema owner Sherill C. Corwin. 20th Century Fox then approved of the production.The cast that Irwin Allen initially had in mind was somewhat different from the cast that ultimately appeared in the movie. Mr. Allen wanted George C. Scott to play Reverend Scott, Petulia Clark as Nonny, and Esther Williams as Belle. Shelley Winters, who was a skilled swimmer, was ultimately cast as Belle. Burt Lancaster was offered the role of Reverend Scott, but turned it down. Gene Wilder was cast as shy bachelor James Martin, but dropped out of the project. Red Buttons played James Martin in the movie. Largely out of necessity, The Poseidon Adventure (1972) used state-of-the-art special effects. A scale model, based on the Queen Mary, was constructed, and used in the scene where the Poseidon capsizes. 20th Century Fox built the sets for the ship inside a large gimble that would give the actors the sensation of an actual rolling ship. The famous scene of a passenger falling from the floor (now rightside up) through a skylight was a practical special effect using famed stuntman Ernie F. Orsatti (whose father was Ernie Orsatti, former outfielder and first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals). For the most part the cast did their own stunts, including a scene requiring Shelley Winter to swim through a flooded corridor. The Poseidon Adventure (1972) received largely positive reviews from critics, who gave high marks to the film's special effects. The Poseidon Adventure was the no. 1 movie at the box office by Christmas Day and would remain at no. 1 through New Years. The Getaway (1972) displaced The Poseidon Adventure (1972) for a week, after it which retook the number one spot and kept it for eight full weeks. The Poseidon Adventure (1972) made its television debut on ABC on October 27 1974. It did very well in the ratings, become the sixth highest rated movie to air on television at the time. ABC had paid $3.2 million for the rights, which given its ratings was well worth it.The Poseidon Adventure (1972) was followed by a sequel, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979), which not only bombed with the critics, but also with audiences. In the Naughts there would be two new adaptations of the novel The Poseidon Adventure was a made-for-TV movie that aired on NBC on November 20 2005. Poseidon (2006) was a feature film directed by Wolfgang Petersen. It received negative reviews and bombed at the box office.The Poseidon Adventure (1972) has become a cult film and remains popular, particularly as a movie to watch on New Years Eve. It also remains influential. As stated earlier, with Airport (1970), it started the cycle towards all-star disaster movies that lasted for much of the Seventies. Arguably, it would have an influence on every disaster movie made ever since. While its characters may not be well developed and its dialogue banal, the realistic special effects and well-executed sequences make it well worth watching."},

He qualified as chartered accountant before his two years of national service aboard a British minesweeper. Following his service, he worked as a teleprompter operator in British television. The job allowed him to observe television production and learn about writing scripts for television shows. He wrote a script for Armchair Theatre that was not produced, but led him to get writing commissions.

He also wrote for radio and wrote the novel Watching the Wheels Come Off and the collection of novellas Bait, Grist, and Security.Mike Hodges was a very talented director and one who was also very versatile. Each of his films had their own particular style. Get Carter was a tough, edgy neo-noir. Pulp was a comedy thriller that sent up pulp fiction and Old Hollywood. Flash Gordon was a camp science fantasy that had the look of a comic strip on film. Black Rainbow was a psychological thriller. Croupier was another rough-edged neo-noir. Mike Hodges was comfortable in a number of genres and always produced great work regardless of the type of film he was directing. He really should make any list of the great directors of the later half of the 20th Century."},
{"title": "Godspeed Diane McBain", "date": "Monday, December 26, 2022", "text": "Actress Diane McBain, who starred on the TV show Surfside 6 and appeared in such movies as Spinout (1966) and The Mini-Skirt Mob (1968), died on December 21 2022 at the age of 81. The cause was liver cancer.Diane McBain was born on May 18 1941 in Cleveland, Ohio. Her family moved to Glendale, California in 1944. As a teenager she did modelling for magazine ads and appeared in television commercials. It was not long before she graduated from high school that she was spotted by a talent scout for Warner Bros. She signed the contract with the studio on her 18th birthday. She made her television debut in 1959 on an episode of Maverick. She played Richard Burton's daughter in her film debut in Ice Palace in 1960. In the late Fifties she guest starred on various Warner Bros. shows in addition to Maverick, including The Alaskans, Sugarfoot, Lawman, and Bourbon Street Beat. It was also in 1960 that she began a two year run playing Daphne Dutton on Surfside Six. In the Sixties Diane McBain continued to star on Surfside 6 as Daphne. She guest starred on Burke's Law four times and guest starred in two episodes of Batman. She also guest starred on Hawaiian Eye; 77 Sunset Strip; Arrest and Trial; Wendy and Me; Valentine's Day; Kraft Suspense Theatre; Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre; Vacation Playhouse; The Wild Wild West; The Man From U.N.C.L.E.; Love, American Style; Mannix; To Rome with Love; and Land of the Giants. She played the title role in the movie Claudelle Inglish (1961), and also appeared in the movies Parrish (1961), Black Gold (1962), The Caretakers (1963), Mary, Mary (1963), A Distant Trumpet (1964), Spinout (1966), Thunder Alley (1967), Maryjane (1968), The Mini-skirt Mob (1968), Five the Hard Way (1969), and I Sailed to Tahiti with an All Girl Crew (1969). In the Seventies Miss McBain guest starred on the shows The Mod Squad; The Wide World of Mystery; Police Story; Barbary Coast; Marcus Welby, M.D.; The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams; Hawaii Five-O; and Charlie's Angels. She appeared in the movies Temporada salvaje (1971), Huyendo del halcón (1973), Wicked, Wicked (1973), and The Deathbed Virgin (1974).In the Eighties Diane McBain had a recurring role on the soap opera Days of Our Lives from 1982 to 1984 and the soap opera General Hospital in 1988. She guest starred on the shows Charlie's Angels; Eight is Enough; Dallas; Matt Houston; Airwolf; Crazy Like a Fox; Knight Rider; and Jake and the Fatman.

In the Naughts she appeared in the movie Besotted (2001) and guest starred on the show Strong Medicine.Diane McBain wrote two novels, The Laughing Bear in 2020 and The Colour of Hope in 2021. Diane McBain was a very fine actress. She played a number of bad girls in her career, a fact about which she complained in the book Fantasy Femmes of Sixties Cinema by Tom Lisanti. In the book she said, \"I wanted to play the ingenue. I could never understand why everyone wanted to play the bitch.\" While in real life Miss McBain was a kind, gentle woman and nothing like those characters, she did do a good job playing them. She played Dean Jagger's spoiled daughter in Parrish, the vixen of the title of the movie Claudelle Inglish, a snobbish society girl in Mary Mary, and the brutal leader of The Mini-Skirt Mob. While Miss McBain did a good job at playing bad girls, she was also quite capable at other roles. After all, among her best known roles is the eccentric Daphne on Surfside 6. She also played socialite Pinky Pinkston, owner of the Pink Chip Stamp Factory and a rare love interest for Bruce Wayne, on Batman. In The Caretakers she played a caring, gentle nurse. She played a farm owner on whose land oil is found in the movie Black Gold. Diane McBain played these roles as well as, enough better than, her many bad girl roles. Diane McBain was a remarkable actress who could play a wide variety of roles and play all of them well."},

{"title": "\"The Changing of the Guard\": The Twilight Zone Christmas Episode That Didn't Air at Christmas", "date": "Saturday, December 24, 2022", "text": "Donald Pleasance asProf. Fowler Perhaps because he was born on Christmas Day, Rod Serling had a particular gift for writing Christmas stories. He wrote the classic 1964 TV movie A Carol for Another Christmas, not to mention Christmas episodes of The Twilight Zone and Night Gallery. Curiously, what in my opinion is the best Christmas episode of The Twilight Zone did not originally air at Christmastime. Instead, \"The Changing of the Guard\" aired in the spring, on June 1 1962. \"The Changing of the Guard\" centres on elderly Professor Ellis Fowler (Donald Pleasance), who teaches English Literature at Rock Spring School, a Vermont prep school. It was at Christmastime that Professor Fowler learns he is being retired after 51 years of teaching, although he will receive free housing and a salary from the school for the rest of his life. Professor Fowler then grows depressed, feeling that he has made no impact in his life and that his lessons have come to nothing. He then decides to kill himself on Christmas Eve. Fortunately, an event occurs that makes Professor Fowler realize just how much good he had done as a teacher.It is no secret that Rod Serling sometimes drew upon his own life in his writing, His Playhouse 90 episode \"The Velvet Alley,\" as well as such episodes of The Twilight Zone as \"Walking Distance\" and \"A Stop at Willoughby\" both featured semi-autobiographical elements. I have to wonder if this isn't the case with \"The Changing of the Guard.\" Certainly, the quote that Professor Fowler reads from a plinth of a statue of Horace Mann comes from Rod Serling's life. \"Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity\" is the school motto of Rod Serling's alma mater, Antioch College. Horace Mann, Antioch College's first president, made the quote at the school's first  commencement. I also have to wonder if the character of Professor Fowler wasn't drawn from one of Rod Serling's professors or perhaps wasn't drawn from several of his professors. Here I want to stress that I have never read anywhere that this was the case. Regardless, Ellis Fowler is one of Rod Serling's best realized characters.Of course, much of this is due to Donald Pleasance's performance. Donald Pleasance was only 42 years old when he appeared in \"The Changing of the Guard,\" yet he is utterly convincing as Professor Fowler. We know Professor Fowler has been teaching for 51 years and the headmaster (Liam Sullivan) states that he passed the usual retirement age long ago. At any rate, Donald Pleasance is entirely convincing in the role and it remains one of the best  roles he ever played on television.Ultimately, while \"The Changing of the Guard\" aired in June rather than December, for me it remains the best of The Twilight Zone's Christmas episodes. It is a better written and better performed episode than \"The Night of the Meek,\" the show's first Christmas episode. And while \"Five Characters in Search of an Exit\" is arguably a better episode, its ties to Christmas are less powerful than \"The Changing of the Guard,\" making \"The Changing of the Guard\" the better episode to watch for the holiday.Indeed, \"The Changing of the Guard\" deals with Christmas themes of rebirth and redemption. In many ways, it can be considered a blend of Goodbye, Mr. Chips and It's a Wonderful Life. \"Changing of the Guard\" also features many of the trappings of the holiday, from Christmas trees and other Christmas decorations to \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\" performed by carolers (some of Professor Fowler's students). Ultimately, it would seem to be very difficult to come away from watching \"Changing of the Guard\" without feeling a good deal of holiday spirit.While \"Changing of the Guard\" may have first aired in June, today many television outlets (MeTV among them) choose to air it at Christmastime. There should be little wonder why. While there are other Twilight Zone Christmas episodes, I would argue it is the best."},
{"title": "The Rankin/Bass Christmas Special Frosty the Snowman", "date": "Friday, December 23, 2022", "text": "In American television history, as of 2022, there have been only two Christmas special that have aired every year without interruption on one of the broadcast networks. What is more, both were produced by Rankin/Bass Productions. The first is Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, which debuted on December 6 1964. The second is Frosty the Snowman, which debuted on December 7 1969. While Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer debuted on NBC and would later move to CBS, Frosty the Snowman is the only Christmas special to have aired every year on the same network. It debuted on CBS and has remained on that network ever since.In 1969 Rankin/Bass Productions was not yet the premier producer of Christmas television special that they would be in 1970, but they were already well on their way. Upon it debut in 1964 Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer would become one of the most successful Christmas specials of all time. In 1968 Rankin/Bass followed the success of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with another special based on a Christmas song, The Little Drummer Boy. With the success of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and The Little Drummer Boy, it was quite natural that Rankin/Bass would produce another Christmas special based on a holiday song. Frosty the Snowman was based on the song by Walter E. Rollins and Steve Nelson song of the same name. It had been a huge hit for Gene Autry in 1950, reaching no. 7 on the Billboard pop singles chart that year. \"Frosty the Snowman\" would be covered by man other artists. In 1950 alone it was covered by Jimmy Durante, Nat King Cole, and Guy Lombardo in addition to Gene Autry. Given the song's success through the years, it must have seemed to Rankin/Bass to have be obvious fodder for a television special.While Frosty the Snowman was based on a song much as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and The Little Drummer Boy were, Frosty the Snowman differed from the other two specials in one important regard. While Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and The Little Drummer Boy were produced using Rankin/Bass's stop-motion process known as Animagic, Frosty the Snowman was produced using tradition cel animation. It was not Rankin/Bass's first cel-animated. Their 1967 Christmas special Cricket on the Heart (based on the Charles Dickens novella of the same name) was their first special that used cel animation. It was followed by Rankin/Bass's 1968 Thanksgiving special The Mouse on the Mayflower, which also produced using cel animation.The animation for both The Cricket on the Hearth and The Mouse On the Mayflower had been provided by Japanese animation studios. This would also be the case with Frosty the Snowman, whose animation was produce by Mushi Productions. If the name \"Mushi Productions\"sounds familiar, it is because they were the animation studio founded by the legendary Osamu Tezuka. By 1969 they had already produced such classic anime series as Astro Boy. Princess Knight, and Kimba the White Lion. By 1969 Osamu Tezuka had already left Mushi Productions in 1968 and formed a new company, Tezuka Productions.While the animation was provided by Mushi Productions, the character designs and backgrounds were created by an American. Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass wanted Frosty the Snowman to have the look of a Christmas card. To this end they hired Paul Coker Jr., a greeting card artist who also had also provided art for Mad magazine starting in 1961. Paul Coker Jr. had earlier did uncredited work on the Rankin/Bass feature film The Wacky World of Mother Goose (1967) and his first credited work for Rankin/Bass on The Cricket on the Hearth. After Frosty the Snowman, Paul Coker Jr. would work as production designer on several more Rankin/Bass specials, including Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, The Year Without a Santa Claus, Frosty's Winter Wonderland, and yet others.Frosty the Snowman was written by Romeo Muller, who had also written the teleplays for the Rankin/Bass specials Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Cricket on the Hearth, The Mouse on the Mayflower, and The Little Drummer Boy, as well as the screenplays for the Rankin/Bass feature films as The Daydreamer (1966) and The Wacky World of Mother Goose (1967). Romeo Muller expanded upon the plot of the song, in which a snowman comes to life after an old silk hat, in which \"there must have been some magic in,\"  upon his head. In the special it snows on Christmas Eve. The local children, among them Karen, build a snowman and place an old silk hat on his head that had been thrown away by inept stage magician Professor Hinkle (Billy De Wolfe). Unfortunately for Frosty (Jackie Vernon), as the children named the snowman, it begins to warm up and so Karen accompanies Frosty the North Pole in the refrigerated car of a train. They are pursued by Professor Hinkle, who wants the hat back after learning it had some magic in it. Here it must be pointed out that, despite being played at the holiday season, the song \"Frosty the Snowman\" makes no reference to Christmas. The special was narrated by Jimmy Durante, who had recorded his own version of the song \"Frosty the Snowman\" in 1950. The voice of Frosty was provided by comedian Jackie Vernon. Professor Hinkle was voiced by Billy De Wolfe, a character actor who had appeared in such films as Blue Skies (1946), The Perils of Pauline (1947), and Lullaby of Broadway (1951). In the original version of Frosty the Snowman, the voices of the school teacher, Karen, and the other children were all provided by legendary voice actor June Foray, then as now best known as the voice of  Rocky the Flying Squirrel and Natasha Fatale on Rocky and His Friends and The Bullwinkle Show. For reasons that remain unknown, after the special originally aired, child actress Suzanne Thompson replaced Miss Foray as the voice of Karen while child actor Greg Thomas replaced Miss Foray as the voices of the other children. Legendary voice actor Paul Frees (the voice of Boris Badenov on Rocky and His Friends and The Bullwinkle Show) provided the voices of a traffic cop, a ticket taker at the train station, and Santa Claus. The success of Frosty the Snowman would lead to two sequels produced by Rankin/Bass. Frosty's Winter Wonderland aired in 1976 and provided Frosty with a wife (a snowwoman the children make for him). Like the original special, it took inspiration from a holiday song, in this case \"Winter Wonderland\" by Dick Smith. Frosty's Winter Wonderland was followed in 1979 by a feature length sequel to both Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman. Like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and unlike Frosty the Snowman and Frosty's Winter Wonderland, Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July used Rankin/Bass's stop-motion process Animagic. It was marked the first and only time Frosty appeared using Animagic rather than cel animation. Billie Mae Richards returned as the voice of Rudolph, while Jackie Vernon returned as the voice of Frosty.A third special is not a sequel to the Rankin/Bass special Frosty the Snowman, although it is often mistaken for such. Frosty Returns was a half hour special produced by Broadway Video and long time \"Charlie Brown\" special animator Bill Melendez for CBS. The animation style is entirely different from that of the Rankin/Bass specials, while the voice of Frosty is provided by John Goodman. Furthermore, Frosty Returns makes no reference to the earlier Rankin/Bass specials. One thing odd about Frosty Returns is that it makes absolutely no reference to Christmas, with the post centred around a winter carnival. Despite having no connection to the original special beyond being based on the same song, CBS usually airs Frosty Returns back to back with Frosty the Snowman.A direct-to-video feature released in 2005 has a bit more of a connection to Rankin/Bass's Frosty the Snowman. The Legend of Frosty the Snowman was produced by Classic Media, who still own the rights to the original special. The character design of Frosty closely copies Paul Coker Jr.'s original, while the character of narrator Old Tommy (Burt Reynolds) greatly resembles the original special's antagonist Professor Hinkle.Aside from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman is the most successful animated Christmas special of all time. At no point in the 53 years since it debuted has it not aired on American broadcast television each year. Indeed, at no point in the past 53 years has it not aired on CBS. After decades on the air, there appears to be no sign that Frosty the Snowman will ever cease airing on television. It seems likely people will still be watching it fifty years from now."},
{"title": "The 70th Anniversary of The Holly and the Ivy", "date": "Thursday, December 22, 2022", "text": "When many think of classic Christmas movies, they may well think of a film made in the United States. It's a Wonderful Life (1946), Miracle on 34th Street (1947), The Bishop's Wife (1947), and others all originated in Hollywood. Even so, the United Kingdom has produced its share of Christmas classics. What many considered the best film adaptation of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, Scrooge (1951--also known as A Christmas Carol) originated in Great Britain. Another British Christmas classic is The Holly and the Ivy (1952). With a cast that includes Sir Ralph Richardson, Celia Johnson, and Margaret Leighton, it was released seventy years ago today, on December 22 1952.The Holly and the Ivy (1952) centres on a widowed English parson (Sir Ralph Richardson) who has devoted his life so much to his congregation that he has neglected his children's emotional well-being. Everything comes to a head over the Christmas holiday, when his family returns to the parsonage.The Holly and the Ivy was based on the play of the same name by Wynyard Browne. The title comes from a tradition British folk Christmas carol, \"The Holly and the Ivy.\" Produced in 1950, the play proved to be a hit at the box office. It was then natural that the play would be adapted for film. Producer Anatole de Grunwald wrote the screenplay for the film, and it was directed by George More O'Ferrall,  a director best known for his work in television. The movie was produced and distributed by British Lion. The Holly and the Ivy was produced on a modest budget, but features a well-known cast nonetheless. Sir Ralph Richardson, who played Reverend Gregory, had already appeared in such classic films as Things to Come (1936), Anna Karenina (1948), and The Fallen Idol (1948). Celia Johnson, who played the parson's eldest daughter Jenny, was best known for her work on stage, but had appeared in the classic film Brief Encounter (1945). Margaret Leighton, who played the parson's younger daughter Margaret, had appeared in Under Capricorn (1949). The cast included such notables as Denholm Elliott, John Gregson, Margaret Halstan, and Maureen Delany, as well as the First Doctor on Doctor Who, William Hartnell, in a small role. The cast of The Holly and the Ivy rehearsed for three weeks before shooting began. Shooting the film only took fourteen days. What is more, the film was shot in sequence, which may well have helped the cast develop the characters as the film's plot unfolded. Despite the play's success and a good deal of critical acclaim, the film version of The Holly and the Ivy did not do well at the box office following its release in the United Kingdom on December 22 1952. The Holly and the Ivy was released in the United States two years later, in 1954. While it was well received by critics, it did not do very well at the box office here either. It was picked up by NBC Films for television distribution, who in 1955 sold its distribution, along with other British films, to Clift TV films, who in turn sold the distribution rights for The Holly and the Ivy and three other British films to WCBS.It would be through television that The Holly and the Ivy would finally find its audience. Although it remains better known in the United Kingdom than the United States, it has developed a following among American classic film fans. While it may not have as high a profile as some classic Christmas movies, the performances of its cast and the well-written screenplay has made it a favourite of many at Christmastime."},
{"title": "The 54th Birthday of Vanessa Marquez", "date": "Wednesday, December 21, 2022", "text": "Today Vanessa Marquez would have turned 54. She was born in Los Angeles County on December 21 1968 and grew up in Montebello, California. For those of you who might not know who Vanessa Marquez was, she was an actress best known for playing Ana Delgado in the classic film Stand and Deliver (1988) and Nurse Wendy Goldman on the hit TV show ER. She was also a regular on the first season of the TV show Culture Clash, starring the comedy troupe of the same name, and she had a recurring role on the TV show Wiseguy. Vanessa Marquez guest starred on such shows as Tequila and Bonetti, Seinfeld, Nurses, Melrose Place, and Malcolm & Eddie. She appeared in such movies as Blood In Blood Out (1993), Twenty Bucks (1993), and Father Hood (1993).For me Vanessa Marquez wasn't just a famous actress. She was also my dearest friend. We met through Twitter as original members of TCMParty, the loosely affiliated group of Turner Classic Movies fans who live tweet movies on the channel using the hashtag \"TCMParty,\" as well as live tweeting episodes of Mad Men. We soon learned we had a good deal in common, from a love of the movie Star Wars to the TV shows Star Trek and The X-Files. Very soon we were in touch very nearly every day through social media and eventually texts and phone calls. Vanessa and I became very close. As for myself, I was in love with her.There was very little Vanessa and I ever disagreed on, although one thing was that she thought she was only cute at best, while I maintained she was beautiful. Over the years I have collected a few head shots of Vanessa from her career as an actress. I submit some of these head shots as proof that she was indeed gorgeous.This first photo is from Vanessa's last years on ER. Her last movie before this photo was taken was Hit Me (1996), originally titled The Ice Cream Dimension.This photo is from the same photo shoot as the above photo.This is another photo of Vanessa from the same era. I am guessing it may be from the same photo shoot as the first two.This head shot of Vanessa is from 1993, the same year that she appeared in the movies Blood In Blood Out, Twenty Bucks, and Father Hood.This is a head shot of Vanessa from 1991. At this point her only credits were Stand and Deliver (1988), Night Children (1989), the TV movie To My Daughter, the TV show Wiseguy, the Wonderworks TV movie Sweet 15, and the TV movie Locked Up: A Mother's Rage. This is the oldest head shot of Vanessa that I have. At this point in her career, her only credits were Stand and Deliver (1988), Night Children (1989), the Wonderworks TV movie Sweet 15, and the stage play Demon Wine. This would have been about 1990.I realize I may be biased, but I honestly think Vanessa Marquez was incredibly beautiful. Of course, she always much more than a pretty face or even a talented actress. Vanessa was sweet, warm hearted, open, intelligent, and she possessed a great sense of humour. She cared deeply about her friends and had this uncanny ability to remember the smallest details about them. She was always swift to defend her friends and worried about them if they were sick. She was happy when things were going well for them and sad when things weren't. In the end Vanessa meant more to me than anyone else in my life, and I miss her to this day. While I miss Vanessa terribly and I am still grieving her over four years after her death, her birthday is still a happy day for me. It marks the anniversary of the birth of the one person who means more to me than anyone else. My life would have been much poorer had I not known Vanessa Marquez."},
{"title": "Babes in Toyland (1961)", "date": "Tuesday, December 20, 2022", "text": "When most people think of a movie version of Victor Herbert's operetta Babes in Toyland, they probably think of the 1934 film starring Laurel & Hardy, also know by the title of a 73 minute, edited version of the movie, March of the Wooden Soldiers. While Babes in Toyland (1934) may remain the best known version of the operetta, it was in 1961 that Walt Disney Productions released their own version of the operetta. In fact, Babes in Toyland (1961) is historic as the first live action musical ever released by Walt Disney.Walt Disney had considered adapting Babes in Toyland much earlier than the late Fifties. In the early Thirties, when Walt Disney was considering various stories for his first animated feature film, among the things he considered was an adaptation of Babes in Toyland. He ultimately settled on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs for the subject of his first feature film, and it would be Hal Roach Studios that would adapt the Victor Herbert operetta, the famous 1934 Babes in Toyland. It was in May 1955 that Walt Disney announced the studio would produce an animated featured film based on Babes in Toyland. By October 1956 Walt Disney had decided that Babes in Toyland would not be an animated feature, but instead would be a live action musical. At the time Bill Walsh was set to produce and Sidney Miller was set to direct. It was set for release in 1957. Ultimately, this would not come to pass and the Babes in Toyland project would be delayed for for a few years. It was announced in August 1959 that the project had been restarted. Legendary animator Ward Kimball was set to direct the live action feature, while Mel Leven would write new lyrics for Victor Herbert's songs.While Mel Leven would remain with Babes in Toyland, Ward Kimball would not. While Walt Disney was on vacation in Europe, Mr. Kimball set about casting the film, something which actually required Mr. Disney's approval. The publicity department realized that the studio's rights to Babes in Toyland were set to expire with the year, and as a result placed ads in the Hollywood trade papers, something which also did not please Walt Disney. As it was, Ward Kimball and Walt Disney came to disagreements over casting. Ward Kimball had one particular actress in mind for the role of Mary Contrary, while Walt Disney wanted Annette Funicello. Ultimately, Walt Disney removed Ward Kimball from the film and assigned Jack Donohue to direct the film. Babes in Toyland would be Annette Funicello's first starring role in a feature film. Ray Bolger was cast as Barnaby, the villain of the film and the first villain he ever played in his career. Tommy Sands was cast as Tom Piper, Mary's love interest. Walt Disney had wanted Dean Jones for the role, and according to Annette Funicello, Michael Callan and James Darren were also considered for the role. The roles of villains Gonzorgo and Roderigo were filled by two veterans of Disney's television series Zorro, Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon respectively. Ed Wynn was cast in the all important role of The Toymaker, while Tommy Kirk was cast as his assistant Grumio.Babes in Toyland departed from the plot of Victor Herbert's operetta a great deal, much as the 1934 version had as well. Only some of Mr. Herbert's music remained, and even then it was sometimes altered a good deal. While Babes in Toyland (1961) was released at Christmas and is often thought of as a Christmas movie, the holiday only plays a role in the plot towards the end of the movie. In some ways this should be no surprise, as Christmas plays no role in Victor Herbert's original operetta. Christmas doesn't play a role in the 1934 film version either (unless one counts a summertime visit from Santa to The Toymaker), despite having been released at Christmas and being shown repeatedly on television during Christmas time. As it turned out, Walt Disney may have regretted departing from the operetta so much. Babes in Toyland opened on December 1961 to reviews that were indifferent at best and hostile at the worst. To make matters worse, audiences appear to have agreed with the critics. In the early Sixties it was rare for a Walt Disney movie to do relatively poorly at the box office, but Babes in Toyland bombed at the box office. Ultimately, the only thing anyone had good to say about the movie was the \"March of the Toys\" sequence that formed its climax, complete with stop-motion animated wooden soldiers.It would be the wooden soldiers from Babes in Toyland (1961) that would prove to be the movie's most lasting impact. Almost immediately they would become a part of Disneyland and would figure in the park's holiday celebrations. They have remained a part of Disneyland's holiday celebrations ever since, as well as those of other Walt Disney Resorts. They would even appear in the stop-motion nursery sequence in Walt Disney's much more successful live-action musical, Mary Poppins (1964). Babes in Toyland  (1961) would air in two parts on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Colour on December 21 and December 27 1969, and it would appear on television a few times since then. In 2002 it was released on DVD and in 2012 it was released on Blu-Ray. It is currently available on the streaming service Disney+.  With Babes in Toyland (1961) Walt Disney had wanted to create a film that would match The Wizard of Oz (1939). At the same time, one had to think he hoped Babes in Toyland (1961) would become a holiday tradition. While it failed at both, Babes in Toyland remains important in the history of Walt Disney. It was the studio's first live-action musical, paving the way for Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), and others. It would also be the first time Annette Funicello played the lead in a feature film (she had appeared in a supporting role in 1959's The Shaggy Dog). Furthermore, the toy soldiers featured in the film have been a part of Walt Disney parks ever since. Babes in Toyland (1961) may not be regarded as a classic even today, but it was an important film nonetheless."},
{"title": "TCM Remembers 2022", "date": "Monday, December 19, 2022", "text": "I have to be frank. This years TCM Remembers is one of the harder ones to watch. We lost some beloved stars this year. I made it to Nichelle Nichols before I teared up, but if I hadn't started tearing up then, I might have done it when they reached Larry Storch, Marsha Hunt, or Paul Sorvino. By the time they reached Dame Angela Lansbury and Sir Sidney Poitier at the end, I seriously doubt many Turner Classic Movies fans wouldn't have teared up at some point. Of course, for me their choice of song did not make it any easier to avoid crying. This year's song is \"The Night We Met\" by Lord Huron. It is one of the best songs ever used in a TCM Remembers, but for me the problem comes down to the fact that Turner Classic Movies used Lord Huron's \"When the Night is Over\" for TCM Remembers 2018, the one that included my beloved Vanessa Marquez. Ever since then I cannot hear Lord Huron without crying. I have only watched this year's TCM Remembers a few times, but I think I have only caught one omission, although it is a really big one. For some reason they did not include Betty White. While Betty was best known for television, she did appear in movies as well. I was actually expecting her towards the end, along with Dame Angela Lansbury and Sir Sidney Poitier. I have to think they will include her later. Anyway, get some tissues ready, because here is TCM Remembers 2022."},
{"title": "Johnny Marks: Composer of  Christmas Songs", "date": "Saturday, December 17, 2022", "text": "The average person might not recognize the name \"Johnny Marks,\" but it is an almost certainty that they have heard more than one of the songs he wrote. Quite simply, Johnny Marks was the composer of some of the most famous Christmas songs of all time, including \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,\" \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,\" and \"A Holly Jolly Christmas.\" It is an interesting fact that while Mr. Marks wrote some of the most successful Yuletide songs of all time, he did not celebrate Christmas himself. Quite simply, Johnny Marks was Jewish.Johnny Marks entered the field of writing Christmas songs through one of his family. His sister was married to Robert L. May, the former advertising copywriter for Montgomery Ward who, in 1939, wrote the children's story \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" as a promotion for the retailer. Eventually Montgomery Ward would give Robert L. May the rights to the story and the character. It was in 1948 that Mr. May persuaded his brother-in-law Johnny Marks to adapt \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" as a song. \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" was offered to Gene Autry, who had already seen some success with his own Christmas song, \"Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane.\" Gene Autry initially rejected the song, but his wife convinced him to record. He recorded \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" in June 1949 and it was released that September. It proved not only to be the biggest hit of Gene Autry's career, but quite possibly the most successful Christmas single of all time besides \"White Christmas\" by Bing Crosby. Johnny Marks would follow \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" with several more Christmas songs, among them \"When Santa Claus Gets Your Letter\" and \"An Old-Fashioned Christmas,\" but he would not have another hit until \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\" by Bing Crosby in 1956. While Johnny Marks wrote the music to \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,\" it had originated as the poem \"Christmas Bells\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in 1863. \"Christmas Bells\" had been set to music as early as 1872, when organist John Baptiste Calkin did so. Johnny Marks set the poem to his own music in 1956 and it was recorded by Bing Crosby. It was two years later that Johnny Marks would receive a writing credit on the song \"Run Rudolph Run\" by Chuck Berry, although Mr. Marks actually had nothing to do with the song and was simply given a credit due to the character of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. While Johnny Marks actually had little to do with \"Run Rudolph Run,\" he would write a rock 'n' roll Christmas song also released in 1958. Johnny Marks asked twelve year-old Brenda Lee to record \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,\" although she did not understand why given she had yet to see a good deal of success. Upon its initial release in 1958, \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" did not perform particularly well on the charts. It also did not do well when it was re-released in 1959. \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" finally took off in 1960, when it reached no. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. It would continue do well afterwards every holiday season.Johnny Marks's next hit Christmas songs would come about because his very first Christmas hit, \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\" One of Johnny Marks's neighbours in the early Sixties was Arthur Rankin Jr., a producer with Videocraft International Ltd. (later known as Rankin/Bass Productions Inc.). It was Arthur Rakin Jr. who suggested to Mr Marks that the song \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" could be adapted as a stop-motion animated television special. Johnny Marks was initially reluctant, but eventually Arthur Rankin Jr. was able to sell him on the idea of the television special, but to provide songs for the special as well.The songs Johnny Marks wrote for the television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer would prove to be a success. Indeed, two of the songs would become hits for Burl Ives (who narrated the special) and would go onto become Christmas standards. \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" has since been covered by several artists, and the original Burl Ives version would return to the charts several times over the years. \"Silver and Gold\" from the special would also prove to be popular. Johnny Marks would not repeat the success of the songs from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, although he would write songs for two more Christmas television specials. Johnny Marks also wrote songs for the 1975 DePatie-Freleng cel-animated television special The Tiny Tree, and the special included his 1959 song \"A Merry Merry Christmas to You.\" The following year he provided songs for Rankin/Bass's sequel to their classic 1964 television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Rudolph's Shiny New Year. Johnny Marks died on September 3 1985 at the age of 75 from complications from diabetes. He left behind a legacy of hit Christmas songs that are matched by very few. \"Johnny Marks\" may not be a household name, but his songs certainly are."},
{"title": "The Norelco Santa Claus", "date": "Friday, December 16, 2022", "text": "Chances are good that if you are an American of a certain age, you remember television commercials done in stop motion animation of Santa Claus riding an upside-down, electric razor across a snowy landscape. The commercials were for Norelco electric razors and aired for years each holiday season. They proved to be among the most popular commercials of all time and remain fondly remembered by many.Norelco is the brand name used by Koninklijke Philips N.V. for its electric razors in the United States. Phillips was founded in 1891 in Eindhoven by Gerard Philips as company that made light bulbs. It was in 1939 that Philips expanded into the electric razor market, although they were unable to introduce their electric razors into the United States until 1948 due to World War II. Philips was prevented from using the \"Philips\" name in the United States by American electronics company Philco, who argued that the names of the two companies were similar enough to result in confusion. For the American market Philips then created the name Norelco, short for \"North American Philips [electrical] Company.\" It was in 1981 that Philips bought Philco, thus allowing Philips to use their name in the United States if they chose to. Of course, by that time Norelco was a recognizable brand name in United States and as a result Philips would continue to use the name. It was in 2005 that Philips started branding their electric razors in the United States \"Philips Norelco,\" in the first step in phasing out the \"Norelco\" name. As of 2022, however, their razors are still branded \"Philips Norelco.\"The Norelco stop-motion animation television commercials featuring Santa Claus first aired in 1961. There really isn't any information on the origin of the commercials to be found online. Norelco's advertising agency at the time was C. J. LaRoche & Company, so I would presume the idea for the ad originated in their offices. As to who actually created the stop-motion animation for the commercial, that remains a mystery. Because of its similarity to the stop-motion animation of the Rankin/Bass television specials, there are those who have assumed that they were responsible for the Norelco Santa Claus ads. That is not the case and, in fact, the first Norelco Santa Claus ad aired three years before Rankin/Bass's first Christmas special, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (which debuted in 1964).From the beginning the plot of the Norelco Santa Claus ads roughly remained the same. It featured Santa Claus riding an upside down electric razor attachment over a snowy landscape, usually with an instrumental version of \"Jingle Bells\" playing. Apparently in some of the earlier commercials there was a jingle, performed to the tune of \"Jingle Bells,\" that  went \"Floating heads, floating heads, floating all the way/Norelco is the shaving gift to give on Christmas day.\" The commercials would end with \"Norelco\" spelled as \"Noëlco,\" with the slogan, \"Even our name says, 'Merry Christmas.'\" The Norelco Santa Claus ads proved popular from the beginning, and in the Sixties and Seventies were nearly ubiquitous. They aired during everything from NFL games to prime time programming. As Norelco razors would change over the years, the commercials would be updated from time to time. The Norelco Santa Claus commercials would be pulled in 1986 as Norelco decided to spend their advertising money on other campaigns. Viewers missed the Norelco commercials, however, so that in 1997 a new version of the Norelco Santa Claus commercial was introduced, this time done in computer animation rather than stop-motion. After a time the Norelco Santa Claus commercials would disappear again, only to be revived again in 2011. The success of the Norelco Santa Claus commercials perhaps came down to two factors. The first is that when the commercials debuted in 1961, stop-motion animation was rarely seen on television and particularly not in commercials made for adults. The Norelco Santa commercials were then unlike anything else on the air at the time. The second is the sheer novelty of Santa Claus riding an oversized electric razor attachment across snowy hills. Whoever had the initial idea that the top of an electric razor resembles a sleigh had a stroke of genius.Below is a collection of Norelco Santa commercials over the years."},

He eventually became a featured male soloist on the show. After Sing Along With Mitch was cancelled, Mitch Miller and his company of singers performed at the Desert Inn in Las Vegas and then went a 30 date tour of Japan.

David Connell had worked on the children's show Captain Kangaroo when he left to join the newly formed Children's Television Workshop as a vice president in charge of production. He asked Bob McGrath to audition for a new show they had planned, Sesame Street. Bob McGrath would remain on the show for 47 years and would continue to appear at live Sesame Street events for some time after that.There can be no doubt that Bob McGrath was responsible for much of the success of Sesame Street. He was a gifted tenor who had a way with songs. He also had a gentle demeanour that was perfectly suited to a children's show. For many children he may well have seemed more like a kindly neighbour than a television personality. Indeed, for many Sesame Street may not seem possible without Bob McGrath."},

In the Naughts he continued to appear on Walker, Texas Ranger. He appeared in the movie Left Behind: Tribulation Force (2002). In the Teens he appeared in the movies Little Monsters (2012), Chasing Shakespeare (2013), A Matter of Faith (2014), The Track (2015), Rabbit Days (2016), The Sector (2016),  and The Perfect Race (2019). He appeared the TV movie Christmas on the Coast.Clarence Gilyard was a talented and versatile actor. This can be seen in what may be his two best known roles. In Die Hard he played villain Hans Gruber's computer hacker Theo. Theo was arrogant and sarcastic, and a bit lacking in feelings for others (he even jokes when people die). On Matlock he played Conrad McMasters. In contrast to Theo, Conrad is easy going and good natured. He truly cares for others. Clarence Gilyard could play a variety of characters and play all of them well."},
{"title": "IMDB Should Return to the Old Name Page Design", "date": "Thursday, December 1, 2022", "text": "Today IMDB debuted its redesign for Name Pages for actors, writers, filmmakers, and other crew members. To say that it is mess would be putting it lightly. The Name Page redesign is harder to navigate and it is also much less intuitive than the old Name Page Design was. It also happens to be aesthetically unappealing.To wit, in the redesign there is a huge amount of empty space on the screen, in contrast to the old design which was tightly put together. Both the Photos section and the \"Known for\" section on the Name Page redesign are much too large. The items on the right sidebar are also much too large.  In fact, even the fonts used in the redesign are too large.Of course, the right sidebar on IMDB's Name Page redesign has other problems besides the items on it being too large. It is missing some important information, such as Awards, Trivia, and so on. Now some of this information can be found by scrolling down on the page, but some (such as Awards) have apparently disappeared. With regards to the items that are included on the sidebar, I noticed that on the user lists there is no way to view all of the lists on which an individual may be included. The Name Page redesign is harder to navigate in yet other ways as well. By default filmographies are sorted by year. I know many IMDB users, myself included, prefer to have the filmographies sorted by media (television, movies, et. al.). Now one can still view filmographies this way, but to do so one must use filters, which might not be obvious to everyone. Worse yet, IMDB does not save your filters, so if you visit another actor, director, producer, writer, or crew member's page you have to apply the filters all over again.Perhaps the worst change made with the redesign is the way individual episodes of television shows in an actor or other crew member's filmography are handled. In the old Name Page design, the episodes on which a particular artist, be they an actor, director, writer, or whatever, worked were all listed under the particular television series. For instance, with my dearest Vanessa Marquez, every ER episode in which she appeared would be listed under ER. On the Name Page redesign there is merely a link reading how many episodes on which a crew member worked (in Vanessa's case with regards to ER, \"27 episodes\"). One has to click on this link to see the individual episodes, which are displayed in a pop up. This pop up is not particularly easy to navigate, with the episodes divided by season. Worse yet, for many it may not be easy to read, given it has a charcoal grey background. IMDB claims that the Name Page redesign is meant to \"make your IMDb experience easier and more enjoyable by providing better access to photos and videos, an upgraded view of an individual’s credits, and improved mobile navigation making it easier to view IMDb features on the go.\" Quite frankly, none of this is true. The redesign does not give better access to photos and videos than the old design. The view of an individuals' credits is a downgrade rather than an upgrade. As to the navigation, it would be horrible on a smart phone, let alone a computer. Worst of all, the redesign is, to put it bluntly, ugly and far from sleek or modern. A commentor on the IMDB community compared it to a combination of Windows 8 Metro and the redesign of Netflix from many years ago. At any rate, given to the reaction on the IMDB community, IMDB users seem to be united in their hatred of the Name Page redesign. My suggestion to IMDB is that they revert to the old Name Page design immediately and fire anyone and everyone involved with the Name Page redesign. Yes, it is that bad."},

For me, at least, this year will be no different. I am happy to see that once again TCM will be showing my all time favourite Christmas movie, The Apartment (1960), this year. What is more, they're showing it twice and one of those time is on Christmas Day at that! Of course, TCM is also showing many of my other favourites as usual, including The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942), Christmas in Connecticut (1944), The Bishop's Wife (1947), It Happened on 5th Avenue (1947), and Holiday Affair (1949).Below is a schedule I compiled of all the Christmas movies on TCM next month.

As much as I love Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), I have never thought of it as a Christmas movie!

{"title": "Johnny Passe by Scott Fivelson and Tim Cleavenger", "date": "Friday, November 25, 2022", "text": "The hard-boiled detective story emerged in pulp magazines like Black Mask in the 1920s and became popular in the 1930s. It was in the late 1920s improvements in microphone technology saw the emergence of crooners such as Russ Columbo and Bing Crosby. Crooners were very much in vogue in the 1930s, with possibly its most popular performer, Frank Sinatra, emerging in the 1940s. The novella Johnny Passe (Hen House Press) by Scott Fivelson and Tim Cleavenger is a humorous pastiche of hard-boiled detective fiction. It includes many of the hallmarks of the genre, from the down-and-out detective of the title to a mysterious client to a complicated case. It is written in first person, with Johnny Passe himself telling how he missed the biggest opportunity of his life. Scott Fivelson is the author of the novel Tuxes as well as the one-act plays Dial L For Latch-Key and Leading the Witness. He is also the writer and director of the film, Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story, and co-screenwriter along with Caroline Allward of the upcoming British romantic-comedy mystery, The Vicar’s Wife.Fans of hard-boiled fiction will appreciate Johnny Passe. Authors Scott Fivelson and Tim Cleavenger capture the narration of Raymond Chandler's short stories and novels perfectly. And, as mentioned earlier, they send up many of the tropes of the genre, from a menacing villain to a beautiful girl. What ultimately makes Johnny Passe so enjoyable is that its authors take it in a direction that Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler or many other hard-boiled writers would have never taken it. While readers will appreciate the outcome of Johnny Passe, they certainly won't expect it.Hard-boiled fiction and the crooners were both phenomena of the 20th Century that remain popular in the 21st. The many fans of both will enjoy Johnny Passe, a very funny, but loving pastiche of both."},

{"title": "American Graffiti (1973)", "date": "Sunday, November 20, 2022", "text": "This post is part of the Fake Teenager Festivus hosted by Taking Up Room)Today George Lucas's second feature film, American Graffiti (1973), is generally overshadowed by Star Wars (1977). Even so, while American Graffiti did not make nearly as much money as Star Wars, it was very successful and proved influential in its own right. Indeed, while it cost only  $1.27 million to make, it grossed  $55 million worldwide. It was the third highest grossing film in the United States after The Exorcist and The Sting for the year 1973.American Graffiti centres on four friends, recent high school graduates Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve Bolander (Ron Howard), drag racer John Milner (Paul Le Mat), and Terry \"the Toad\" Fields (Charles Martin Smith) during the last night of summer vacation in the year 1962 in Modesto, California. The next morning Curt and Steve will make the trip east to attend college. Music plays a large role in the movie, with the soundtrack consisting of popular songs from the era. The origins of American Graffiti go back to George Lucas's first feature film THX 1138. It was in 1969 that Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas founded American Zoetrope. THX 1138 was only the second film released by American Zoetrope, after Francis Ford Coppola's The Rain People (1969). Sadly, THX 1138 received mixed reviews and bombed at the box office. Francis Ford Coppola challenged George Lucas to write something more mainstream and more commercial.For inspiration George Lucas looked to his own youth, when cruising was still a phenomenon. For those unfamiliar with cruising, it is simply driving around town aimlessly, talking to other cruisers and pedestrians as one does so. In the United States cruising was an activity in which many teenagers engaged from the 1950s and, in some areas, as late as the 1980s. George Lucas drew upon his own life to provide parts of the story, while the four main characters were based on himself from different phases in his life. For additional inspiration, George Lucas looked to Federico Fellini's film I Vitelloni, which centred on five young men in a small town in Italy.Originally titled Another Quiet Night in Modesto, George Lucas eventually retitled his idea for a film American Graffiti. He wrote 15 page treatment and then hired  Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the screenplay.William Huyck had earlier co-written the film The Devil's 8 (1968). Ultimately, William Huyck and Gloria Katz were unable to complete the screenplay for American Graffiti, due to the start of their own film, the horror movie Messiah of Evil (1973). George Lucas then hired Richard Waller to finish the screenplay. Both George Lucas and Richard Waller had attended the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Unfortunately for George Lucas, Richard Waller's screenplay would owe more to teenage exploitation films than the more realistic portrayal of a night in the life of teenagers in 1962 that Mr. Lucas wanted. Richard Waller did rewrite the screenplay, but ultimately, George Lucas fired him due to creative differences. George Lucas then completed the screenplay himself, finishing it in three weeks. George Lucas, William Huyck, and Gloria Katz then wrote the second draft of the screenplay together. While American Graffiti would be a smash hit, George Lucas had trouble finding a  home for the film. Initially the various studios shied away from the movie out of the fear that the music licences would cost a fortune. MGM, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, and Columbia Pictures all refused to provide financing for the movie and to distribute it. While American International showed some interest in American Graffiti, they ultimately turned it down as it did not contain enough of the sex and violence for which they were known in that era. Ultimately, Universal agreed to co-finance and distribute the movie. They gave George Lucas artistic control over the film, as well as approval of the final cut, provided American Graffiti was produced on a very low budget. The casting director on American Graffiti was Fred Roos, who had earlier served as the casting director on The Andy Griffith Show. It was because of Mr. Roos that Ron Howard, who had played Opie Taylor on The Andy Griffith Show, was cast as Steve. As for the rest of the casting, it was both long and involved. A casting call was put out throughout community theatres and high school drama groups in California's Bay Area. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role of Curt alone. Despite the casting call sent out to high school drama groups and community theatres for younger actors, of the four leads, only Ron Howard and Charles Martin Smith were actually teenagers Both actors were 18 at the time shooting began. Richard Dreyfuss was 24 years old at the time. At 26, Paul Le Mat was the oldest of the four leads in American Graffiti. Messrs. Dreyfuss and Le Mat were hardly alone in playing characters several years younger than they were. Suzanne Somers, who played the infamous Blonde in the Ford Thunderbird, was 26 at the time. While it is unclear how old drag racer Bob Falfa is in the film (he may be in his twenties), the actor playing him, Harrison Ford, was just shy of his 30th birthday when shooting began. It is a tribute to the talent of much of the cast that, despite being older than their characters, they are convincing as teenagers.While American Graffiti is set in Modesto, much of the film was shot in Petaluma as George Lucas thought Modesto had changed too much since 1962. The \"Burger City\" drive-in restaurant was actually the famous Mel's Drive-In in San Francisco. The freshman sock hop was shot at Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley. The radio station at which Wolfman Jack works was KRE-AM in Berkeley. Amazingly enough for a film that would be both a box office smash and a darling of critics, Universal was not overly fond of American Graffiti. Even though a test screening of the film in January 1973 had gone very well, Universal wanted to re-edit the film. Francis Ford Coppola, fresh from his success with The Godfather, took up for the film and even offered to buy it. Both 20th Century Fox and Paramount, initially uninterested in the movie, also offered to buy American Graffiti. It was after Francis Ford Coppola had won his Oscar for The Godfather that Universal relented and asked that only a few minutes be cut from American Graffiti. Even so, Universal was convinced that American Graffiti was suited only for release as a television movie. Fortunately, many Universal employees loved the film and their praise eventually convinced the studio to give the movie a limited release in Los Angeles and New York. The movie was a success in both markets, and it was ultimately released in the United States on August 11 1973. As mentioned above, American Graffiti proved to be a success with both critics and audiences. It would also prove to be influential. At the time of the movie's release, only Ron Howard was well-known, having played Opie on The Andy Griffith Show and appearing in various movies. American Graffiti turned Richard Dreyfuss into a star. It would only be two years later that he would star in Jaws (1975). Cindy Williams, who played Steve's girlfriend Laurie, would find success on the hit sitcom Laverne & Shirley in only a few years. Mackenzie Phillips and Suzanne Somers would also find success it sitcoms in only a few years, on One Day at a Time and Three's Company respectively. As to Harrison Ford, he would ascend to superstardom in George Lucas's next movie, playing Han Solo in Star Wars (1977).Of course, American Graffiti would prove influential beyond its cast. A nostalgia craze had been brewing in the United States prior to the movie's release, but arguably it was American Graffiti that kicked it into high gear. Such period films as The Lords of Flatbush (1974), Cooley High (1975), and National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) were released in the wake of American Graffiti. American Graffiti would also have some impact on television. Happy Days had begun life as an episode of the anthology series Love, American Style in 1972. It starred Ron Howard, Marion Ross, and Anson Williams. With the success of American Graffiti, ABC took an interest in developing the episode into a series and so Happy Days was born. Beyond adding fuel to the Seventies nostalgia craze, American Graffiti arguably created an entire subgenre of period films that simply portrayed a short period in characters' lives. Arguably such diverse films as Diner (1982), Stand by Me (1986), and Dazed and Confused (1993) owe something to American Graffiti. If the coming of age period piece has been seen regularly for nearly the past fifty years, it is largely because of American Graffiti.Certainly American Graffiti is not as influential as Star Wars (1977), but that is not to say the film did not have a huge impact. The movie had a lasting influence on American cinema that lasts to this day. That influence is still being felt."},
{"title": "Jay Silverheels as Geronimo", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2022", "text": "Today Jay Silverheels is best remembered as Tonto on the television series The Lone Ranger. This is unfortunate, as Jay Silverheels played many other roles in his career, roles that are not regarded as stereotypical as Tonto is today. Indeed, what is often overlooked is that Jay Silverheels played Apache leader Geronimo no less than three times.The first time Jay Silverheels portrayed Geronimo was in the 1950 movie Broken Arrow. Broken Arrow starred James Stewart as Tom Jeffords, a historical figure who was friends with Apache leader Cochise and who was instrumental in ending the Indian wars in Arizona Territory. While today Broken Arrow is problematic insofar as it stars Jeff Chandler in redface as Cochise, as well as other white actors portraying Native Americans, it is one of the earliest movies to portray American Indians sympathetically. Jay Silverheels only appears briefly as Geronimo in the film, but that appearance is significant. Geronimo is not portrayed as a savage bent on killing white settlers, but instead as a leader among his people seeking the best path forward for them. When he opposes the peace treaty Tom Jeffords has negotiated with Cochise, it is clear he has his reasons for doing do. Although brief, Jay Silverheels's performance as Geronimo numbers among his best, lending the Apache leader the gravitas one would expect of him.It would be two years later that Jay Silverheels would once more portray Geronimo in the movie The Battle at Apache Pass (1952). Like Broken Arrow, The Battle at Apache Pass was also based on history, in this case it was loosely based on both The Bascom Affair from 1961 and the Battle of Apache Pass from 1862. The Battle at Apache Pass had two more things in common with Broken Arrow. First, Cochise was once more played by Jeff Chandler in redface and Geronimo was played by Jay Silverheels. Second, the movie also treats Native Americans sympathetically.Unfortunately, while Jay Silverheels does a good job in the role, the movie's portrayal of Geronimo is less than would be desired. At one point Geronimo plots with two white men to frame Cochise for an attack on a ranch, something that not only never happened historically, but would have been out of character for the historical Geronimo. Sadly, the makers of The Battle of Apache Pass chose to make Geronimo a traditional screen villain instead of portraying him accurately.The final time Jay Silverheels would play Geronimo was in the Audie Murphy Western Walk the Proud Land (1956). Walk the Proud Land was also based on history, in this case on introduction of limited self-government to the Apache by Indian agent John Clum (Audie Murphy). Like Broken Arrow and The Battle at Apache Pass, Walk the Proud Land features examples of redface, namely Anne Bancroft as an Indian widow who is John Clum's housekeeper and Robert Warwick as Apache leader Eskiminzin. Even so, like Broken Arrow and The Battle at Apache Pass before it, Native Americans are treated with sympathy in Walk the Proud Land. Indeed, Geronimo fares better in Walk the Proud Land that he had in The Battle at Apache Pass. Like Broken Arrow, Geronimo is portrayed as doing what he believes is best for his people, even if that means resorting to violence.Over the years Jay Silverheels has received a lot of criticism for having played Tonto on The Lone Ranger, but throughout his career he played many other roles as well, roles that were not stereotypes. His three performances as Geronimo were all fine, even if the portrayal of the Apache leader is less than is desired in The Battle of Apache Pass. In both Broken Arrow and Walk the Proud Land he brought a dignity to the historical figure at time when American Indians were still often being portrayed as savages."},

{"title": "The Film Noirs of Veronica Lake", "date": "Monday, November 14, 2022", "text": "A promotional photofrom This Gun for HireVeronica Lake was born 100 years ago on this date. Among her best known films today are comedies, such as Sullivan's Travels (1941) and I Married a Witch (1942), but she made other types of films as well. Indeed, among classic movies buffs, Veronica Lake is also remembered for film noirs she made with Alan Ladd. When people think of film noir actresses, Veronica Lake might not be the first name that comes to mind, she starred in a few influential film noirs made during the movement's formative years.Indeed, the first film she made with Alan Ladd, This Gun for Hire (1942), was the movie that made Alan Ladd a star. The film starred Macdonald Carey as Lt. Michael Crane, a police detective investigating the murder of a blackmailer by paid assassin Philip Raven (Alan Ladd). Veronica Lake played Lt. Crane's girlfriend, stage magician and nightclub singer Ellen Graham. While Veronica Lake and Macdonald Carey were technically the stars of This Gun for Hire, it was arguably Alan Ladd who stole the show. His star power was obvious even before the movie was finished, as was his chemistry with Veronica Lake. It was even before This Gun for Hire was completed that Paramount announced him as the star of The Glass Key.This Gun for Hire received positive reviews, with Alan Ladd often singled out for praise. It also did well at the box office. Beyond cementing Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake as co-stars in crime films, it would also have an influence on the development of film noir. Released in 1942, it was among the earliest movies that is identifiably noir. As mentioned above, Alan Ladd was cast in The Glass Key (1942) even before This Gun for Hire as finished. The Glass Key was an adaptation of the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Paramount had already released an adaptation of the novel in 1935 starring George Raft. While that version would prove to be one of George Raft's most successful movies of the Thirties, it was not particularly well received by critics. Regardless, Paramount apparently thought it was the perfect vehicle for Alan Ladd. It probably helped that The Maltese Falcon (1941), also based on a Dashiell Hammett novel, had been a hit for Warner Bros. the previous year.In The Glass Key Veronica Lake played Janet Henry, the daughter of a candidate for governor (Moroni Olsen). Political boss Paul Madvig (Brian Donlevy) falls in love with Janet, and for that reason decides to help get her father elected. Alan Ladd played Madvig's right-hand man, Ed Beaumont, who also falls in love with Janet. Janet's brother Taylor (Richard Denning) creates problems for everyone in that he owes gambling debts to gangster Nick Varna (Joseph Calleia), who is already unhappy with Madvig and Henry after being informed by Madvig that he plans to clean up the city.Oddly enough, in The Glass Key it is Brian Donlevy who gets top billing, followed by Veronica Lake and then Alan Ladd. Like This Gun for Hire before it, however, it is Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd who are the real stars. And like This Gun for Hire, it also received positive reviews.Despite the success of This Gun for Hire and The Glass Key, it would be a few years before Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd would make another film noir together, although they had cameos in the film adaptation of the popular radio show Duffy's Tavern (1945). Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd's next film noir, The Blue Dahlia, was not released until 1946. Among other things, The Blue Dahlia was the first and only original screenplay written by Raymond Chandler. The Blue Dahlia starred Alan Ladd as Johnny Morrison, a United States Navy pilot whose discovers his wife is having an affair with Eddie Harwood (Howard Da Silva), owner of the Blue Dahlia nightclub. Ultimately, Johnny finds himself accused of murder when his wife Helen (Doris Dowling) winds up dead. Veronica Lake's part in the film is small. She plays Joyce Harwood, the estranged wife of Eddie Harwood, whose path crosses with Johnny Morrison in the film The Blue Dahlia received positive reviews and did well at the box office in the United Kingdom. It would be two years later that Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake would appear in their final film noir together. Saigon (1948) starred Alan Ladd as Major Larry Briggs, who, with two of his buddies from the war, run afoul of a dangerous criminal. Veronica Lake played Susan Cleaver, the secretary of a war profiteer from who Larry has taken work as a pilot. Saigon did not received particularly good reviews, with critics pointing out the weakness of the movie's story. The film did not do as well at the box office as Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd's previous films, although it was not a bomb by any stretch of the imagination.Saigon would be the last film Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd made together. This was perhaps in part because Veronica Lake's career would go into decline. Her last few films of the Forties did not match the success of her earlier films. In 1948 Paramount decided not to renew her contract. After leaving Paramount, Veronica Lake would only make four more films in her lifetime. Veronica Lake only appeared in four film noirs. Indeed, her career was coming to an end even as the film noir movement was reaching its peak in the late Forties. Even so, her earliest film noirs would leave an impact on the movement. This Gun for Hire and The Glass Key laid the blueprint for many film noirs to come, with Alan Ladd playing morally ambiguous characters and Veronica Lake playing the good girl who initially seems bad. The Blue Dahlia remains a beloved film noir, respected for its atmosphere and dialogue. Although she appeared in far fewer film noirs than other actresses, Veronica Lake remains tied to the movement to this day."},
{"title": "The Late Great Kevin Conroy ", "date": "Sunday, November 13, 2022", "text": "Kevin Conroy, who first provided the voice of Batman in Batman: The Animated Series and voiced the character longer than any other actor, died on November 10 2022 at the age of 66. The cause was cancer.Kevin Conroy was born on November 30 1955 in Westbury, New York. He grew up in Westport, Connecticut. He studied acting at Julliard under actor and director John Houseman, and was room mates with Robin Williams. Among those at Julliard at the same time as Mr. Conroy was future Superman Christopher Reeve. After he graduated from Julliard he toured as part of The Acting Company. Mr. Conroy made his television debut in a bit part as a bartender in the TV movie How to Pick Up Girls in 1978. He had a regular role on the soap opera Another World from 1980 to 1981. In the Eighties he had  recurring or regular roles on Search for Tomorrow, Dynasty, Ohara, and Tour of Duty. He guest starred on the shows Matlock, Kay O'Brien, Spenser: For Hire, Cheers, and WIOU. He played Ted Kennedy in the mini-series Kennedy and John Laurens in the mini-series George Washington.It was in 1992 that Kevin Conroy began his long stint playing Batman with Batman: The Animated Series. He would play Batman on the TV shows The New Batman Adventures, Superman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, Static Shock. The Zeta Project, Justice League, Justice League Unlimited, Justice League Action, Teen Titans Go, and Scooby Doo and Guess Who?. He provided the voice of Batman in the TV movies The Batman Superman Movie: World's Finest and Batman Beyond: the Movie, as well as the mini-series Tales of Metropolis. He also appeared in live action as Bruce Wayne in the Batwoman episode of the crossover miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths. He provided the voice of Batman in several feature films, starting with Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993). He voiced Batman in the feature films Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero (1998), Batman Beyond; The Return of The Joker (2000), Batman: Mystery of The Batwoman (2003), Justice League: Starcrossed (2004), Baman: Gotham Knight (2008), Superman/Batman: Public Enemies (2009), Superman/Batman: Apocalypse (2010), Justice League: Doom (2012), Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013), Batman: Assault on Arkham (2014),  Batman: The Killing Joke (2016), Batman and Harley Quinn (2017), and Justice League vs. the Fatal Five (2019). He provided the voice of Bruce Wayne's father Thomas Wayne in Batman vs. Robin (2015) and guest starred as Robin's father John Grayson in an episode of The Batman. He also voiced Batman in several video games, beginning with The Adventures of Batman & Robin in 1996. He last voiced Batman in a video game in MultiVersus, released this year. During the Nineties Kevin Conroy also had a regular role on the TV show Rachel Gunn, R.N. He had a recurring role on The Office. He guest starred on the shows Murphy Brown and The Real Adventures of Johnny Quest. Kevin Conroy made his movie debut in Chain of Desire in 1992. In the Naughts, in addition to voicing Batman in various DC Comics projects, he guest starred on the shows Ben 10: Alien Force and The Venture Brothers.

In the Twenties he was a guest voice on the animated shows Masters of the Universe: Revelation and He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Kevin Conroy is considered by many, perhaps most fans as the definitive voice of Batman. When many hear the voice of Batman in their head, it is not Adam West, Michael Keaton, or Christian Bale they hear, but Kevin Conroy. If Kevin Conroy is the quintessential Batman, it is with good reason. He brought a suitable air of menace to the character, but with an underlying humanity. He drew upon his own life to channel a character whose life had been shaped by tragedy. More so than any other actor, Kevin Conroy brought out the fact that at his core, Batman was someone who had lost his parents at a very young age. This made it much easier for viewers to identify with Kevin Conroy's Batman than any Batman before or since.Of course, Kevin Conroy played more roles than Batman. He played the extremely patient Captain Rusty Wallace on Tour of Duty. On Dynasty he played gay politician Bart Fallmount. He also had a successful stage career. He appeared on Broadway in Lolita in 1981. In 1989 he appeared in Eastern Standard, in which he played a television producer recently diagnosed with AIDS. While Kevin Conroy was an extremely talented actor, he was also a true gentleman known for his kindness and thoughtfulness. Following the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks, Mr. Conroy volunteered to cook for firefighters, police officers, and other emergency service workers. He frequently attended conventions, where he would always take time with his fans, who always said that he was the nicest person one could meet. Kevin Conroy was also on Cameo, the video-sharing service that allows celebrities to send personalized messages to their fans. He was well-known for creating longer messages than he had to, taking time to let fans know how much they meant to him. Following Mr. Conroy's death, a DC Animated Universe fan shared on Twitter a Cameo video they had received from him following the death of their grandmother. Opening the video as Batman, Kevin Conroy shared his own experiences with death and grief and gave comfort to the fan. When it came to his fellow human beings, particularly his fans, Kevin Conroy always gave more than he was expected to. He was a kind, loving man who truly cared for his fellow human beings. In the end, Kevin Conroy not only played a superhero, he was a superhero."},

In the late Fifties he guest starred on the shows Police Station and The Twilight Zone.In the Sixties Ron Masak guest starred on The Monkees, The Second Hundred Years, The Flying Nun, Premiere, Get Smart, The Good Guys, I Dream of Jeannie, Mayberry R.F.D., Nanny and the Professor, Arnie,. Bewitched, and Nancy. He made his movie debut in Ice Station Zebra in 1968. In the late Sixties he also appeared in the movies Second Effort (1968), Daddy Gone A-Hunting (1969), A Time for Dying (1969), and Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). In the Seventies Ron Masak starred on the short-lived TV series Love Thy Neighbor.  He also starred on the short-lived show The Law. He guest starred on the shows The Young Lawyers; Ironside; Marcus Welby, M.D.; The Mary Tyler Moore Show; Funny Face; McMillan & Wife; Insight; Mission: Impossible; Mannix; Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law; Longstreet; The Delphi Bureau; The Bob Newhart Show; Medical Center; Love, American Style; Good Times; Emergency!; Land of the Lost; Police Woman; Barney Miller; Good Heavens; Barnaby Jones; The Feather and Father Gang; The Rockford Files; Alice; Police Story; Wonder Woman; Supertrain; and Eischied. He appeared in the mini-series McNaughton's Daughter and Once an Eagle. He appeared in the movies Evel Knievel (1971), The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker (1971), The Man from Clover Grove (1974), Laserblast (1978), and Harper Valley P.T.A. (1978). In the Eighties Ron Masak began playing Sheriff Mort Metzger. He first appeared in the show's fifth season and remained with it for the rest of its run. He guest starred on the shows Quincy, M.E.; Magnum, P.I.; Jessica Novack; Private Benjamin; Meatballs and Spaghetti; Goodnight, Beantown; The Yellow Rose; Masquerade; Jennifer Slept Here; E/R; The Fisher Family; Diff'rent Strokes; Falcon Crest; Remington Steele; New Love, American Style; Starman; The Law and Harry McGraw; Bustin' Loose; She's the Sheriff; and Webster. He was a guest voice on the animated shows The Real Ghost Busters and Superman. He appeared in the movies Heart Like a Wheel (1983) and Listen to Me (198\\9). In the Nineties he continued to appear on Murder, She Wrote. He guest starred on Columbo. He appeared in the movies Cops n Roberts (1995), No Code of Conduct (1998), and The Thundering 8th (2000). In the Naughts he guest starred on Cold Case. He appeared in the movies The Stoneman (2002) and The Benchwarmers (2006). In the Teens he guest starred on The Bold and Beautiful. He appeared in the movie My Trip Back to the Dark Side (2014), Angels on Tap (2018), and The Last Page of Summer (2020).Ron Masak was a very prolific actor whose career lasted over 60 years. The reason was that he was simply very talented. I suspect he will always be best remembered as Sheriff Mort Metzger on Murder, She Wrote, but he played many others in his career. In the Monkees episode \"Monstrous Monkees Mash\" he played the Count, a vampire who wants to turn Davy into one as well. In the Get Smart episode \"The Worst Best Man,\" he played \"Tiger\" Schlermer, a CONTROL agent whose cover is that of a professional boxer. While Ron Masak may have been best known for his comedic or humorous roles, he also appeared in dramas, including Mission: Impossible; Marcus Welby, M.D.; Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law; Ironside; and others. He was certainly versatile, and he always gave good performances."},
{"title": "The Late Great Jules Bass", "date": "Sunday, November 6, 2022", "text": "Director, producer, lyricist, and author Jules Bass died on October 25 2022 at the age of 87. He is best known for his work with Rankin/Bass Productions, the company he operated with Arthur Rankin, Jr., which produced such classic television specials as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, and The Year Without a Santa Claus.Jules Bass was born on September 16 1935 in Philadelphia. He attended New York University. After graduating from college, he worked in the advertising industry. Arthur Rankin, Jr. was operating his own graphic design firm, which did a good deal of work for the advertising agency at which Jules Bass worked. Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr. soon became friends and set about founding a company that would utilize Arthur Rankin, Jr.'s knowledge of television and Jules Bass's knowledge of advertising. Together they founded Videocraft International on September 14 1960. It would renamed Rankin/Bass Productions in 1967.The first work to emerge from Videocraft International was the TV show The Adventures of Pinocchio in 1960. It was produced using the stop motion technique called Animagic that would become forever associated with Rankin/Bass Productions. Videocraft International followed The Adventures of Pinochio with the TV series Tales of the Wizard of Oz, which utilized cel animation. It would be the year 1964 that would prove to be a breakthrough year for Videocraft International. First, they produced the TV special Return to Oz for NBC's anthology series General Electric Fantasy Hour. It used cel animation. Second, Videocraft International produced what would become the longest running Christmas special of all time, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, which was produced using the Anamagic stop motion technique. Like Return to Oz, it originally aired as part of General Electric Fantasy Hour. The success of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer not only led to more TV specials produced by Videocraft International, but also feature films, the first of which was Willy McBean and His Magic Machine (1965). Like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was made using Anamagic. Videocraft followed Willy McBean and His Magic Machine with The Daydreamer (1966), which was the first feature film directed by Jules Bass. The Daydreamer featured songs with lyrics by Jules Bass and music by Maury Laws. The Daydreamer was followed by Mad Monster Party? (1967), which was also directed by Jules Bass. Jules Bass and Maury Laws once more wrote the lyrics and music. The Wacky World of Mother Goose, also directed by Jules Bass, was released  same year as Mad Monster Party?.While Mad Monster Party? would become a cult film, none of the feature films released by Rankin/Bass in the Sixties did well at the box office. Regardless, Rankin/Bass saw considerable success on television. With Toei Animation, Rankin/Bass produced the Saturday morning cartoon King Kong, which ran for three years on ABC. They produced the television specials Cricket on the Hearth , Mouse on the Mayflower, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, and Santa Claus is Comin' To Town, each of which was co-directed by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass. Rankin/Bass also produced the syndicated TV series The Smokey Bear Show. With music by Maury Laws, Jules Bass wrote the lyrics for many of the songs in these specials, including The Cricket on the Heart, The Mouse on the Mayflower, and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town.The Seventies saw Rankin/Bass produce more Saturday morning cartoons, and Jules Bass directed some of the episodes these included Jackson 5ive, The Osmonds, and Kid Power. They also continued to produce holiday specials, including Here Comes Peter Cottontail, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, The Year Without a Santa Claus, Frosty's Winter Wonderland, and others. Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr. directed the specials, and the lyrics for many of the songs in the specials were written by Jules Bass with Maury Laws providing the music. Rankin/Bass also produced television movie adaptations of The Hobbit and Return of the King. Rankin/Bass produced a two part adaptation of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea that aired on the anthology series Festival of Family Classics. It was directed by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr. Jules Bass served as a producer on the Japanese live-action film The Last Dinosaur (1977). In the Eighties Rankin/Bass produced the feature film The Last Unicorn (1982), which was directed by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr. They produced the TV specials The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold and The Life & Adventures of Santa Claus.  Rankin/Bass' last significant production would be the animated series Thundercats in 1985. Jules Bass stopped producing and directing films and television programs in 1987.Following his work with Rankin/Bass, Jules Bass turned to writing books. He wrote the children's books Herb, the Vegetarian Dragon and Cooking with Herb. He also wrote the novel Headhunters.There was perhaps no influential producer of American holiday television specials than Rankin/Bass Productions. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is the longest running Christmas special of all time. Frosty the Snowman is the only Christmas special to have aired on the same network (CBS) since its debut. A good number of Rankin/Bass Productions' specials would air for years, and many are still seen to this day. For that matter, the feature films Mad Monster Party? and The Last Unicorn have become cult films since their initial release.Of course, Jules Bass not only directed many of the specials and feature films with Arthur Rankin, Jr., he also wrote the lyrics for many of the songs in the specials, with Maury Laws providing the music. Many of the songs were particularly memorable, and are probably responsible for much of the success of the specials. Indeed, the \"Snow Miser & Heat Miser Song\" from A Year Without a Santa Claus has even taken on a life of its own. Indeed, music artists have covered it multiple times. As a director, producer, and lyricist Jules Bass leaves behind an impressive legacy."},

{"title": "The 80th Anniversary of I Married a Witch (1942)", "date": "Sunday, October 30, 2022", "text": "The 1940s saw a cycle of supernatural comedies that lasted throughout much of the decade. Among the movies that kicked off this cycle was I Married a Witch (1942). The film was a success when it was first released and has remained popular to this day. I Married a Witch was released on October 30 1942, a most fitting date given its subject matter.I Married a Witch centred on Wallace Wooley (Fredric March), a man running for the office of governor of his state. He is descended from Jonathan Wooley (also Fredric March), a puritan who accused Jennifer (Veronica Lake) and her father Daniel (Cecil Kellway), who were burned at the stake as a result. Jennifer cursed the Wooley men to always marry the wrong women. After their deaths Jennifer and Daniel's spirits were trapped in a tree. When the tree is struck by lightning in the present day, the two are freed. Jennifer and Daniel then conspire to torment Jonathan Wooley's descendent Wallace Wooley, eventually creating a human body for Jennifer for her to do so. Of course, this being a supernatural comedy, everything does not go according to plan and Jennifer falls in love with Wallace.I Married a Witch was based on The Passionate Witch by Thorne Smith and Norman H. Mason. Thorne Smith may be best known as the author of Topper, and also wrote several other novels as well, including The Night of the Gods and Turnabout. The Passionate Witch was unfinished at the time of Thorne Smith's death, and was completed by Norman H. Matson. It would be French director  René  Clair who would bring The Passionate Witch to the big screen. He had just made his first American film, The Flame of New Orleans (1941) for Universal. Unfortunately, it did not do well at the box office and Universal did not offer him the chance to make another movie. Fortunately,  René Clair's agent Myron Selznick sent him a copy of The Passionate Witch. Mr. Clair thought the book had possibilities as a movie. He met with his friend Preston Sturges, who was then a success at Paramount. At the time Paramount Pictures was looking for projects for Veronica Lake. Preston Sturges was able to convince the studio that The Passionate Witch would make the perfect movie for her. The working title of the film was He Married a Witch, which would eventually be changed to its current title, I Married a Witch. Initially Joel McCrea was going to play the male lead, but he backed out of the project because he did not want to work with Veronica Lake again. He apparently did not enjoy working with her on Sullivan's Travels (1941). Eventually Fredric March was cast in the male lead role of Wallace Wooley. Unfortunately for Fredric March, he would not enjoy working with Veronica Lake very much either. Before he had even met Miss Lake, Fredric March had reportedly said that she was a \"a brainless little blonde sexpot, void of any acting ability.\" This got back to Veronica Lake, who was quite naturally not very happy about it. She in turn called Fredric March, \"a pompous poseur.\" The two did not get along while shooting the film at all, and Miss Lake often did things simply to torment Mr. March. In one instance, when Fredric March had to carry her, she placed a forty pound weight under her dress. I Married a Witch would run afoul of the Production Code Administration (PCA). It was in January 1942 that the PCA sent Paramount a letter telling them that its screenplay was \"flatly in violation of the code.\" Among these violations of the code were \"suggestions of nudity,\" \"sex suggestiveness in Jennifer's attitude in forcing herself upon Wally,\" and \"the overemphasis on liquor and drinking.\" After Paramount made changes the PCA would send the studio another letter in which they admitted there had been improvements, but continued to demand that the screenwriters remove any \"plays on nudity,\" gambling, and \"undue exposure of the female body.\" The Production Code Administration's complaints would delay shooting until April 17 1942, when they finally gave Paramount their approval.I Married a Witch was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Bosley Crowther in The New York Times wrote, \"The strange and beautiful illusion that Veronica Lake is completely unreal is being quite charmingly nourished in René Clair's new film, I Married a Witch.\"  The Chicago Tribune's critic wrote of the film, \"I Married a Witch is bizarre but beguiling. Under Rene Clair's delicately preposterous direction it unreels a story of modern witchcraft, the like of which has not been seen on any screen\" I Married a Witch also did very well at the box office, breaking records in theatres across the United States. I Married a Witch not only proved popular, but eventually it would also prove to be influential. As mentioned earlier, it was among the movies that sparked a cycle of supernatural comedies that would last for the most of the decade of the Forties. Both I Married a Witch (1942) and Bell, Book and Candle (1958) served as inspiration for the classic television show Bewitched. If I Married a Witch proved to be popular, it is because it is a true classic. It is a tribute to the acting talent of both Veronica Lake and Fredric March that their characters have such chemistry. While the film ran afoul of the Production Code, it does manages to get across a good deal of sexuality that most movies of the time would not. It is not only filled with a good deal of witty dialogue, but a number of clever sight gags as well. If I Married a Witch remains popular to this day, it is because it is a truly great film, and one very fitting for Halloween season."},
{"title": "Kenny & Company (1976)", "date": "Saturday, October 29, 2022", "text": "As hard as it may be to believe, despite being a widely celebrated holiday by the early 20th Century, there was a time when Halloween was infrequently mentioned in movies. This would begin to change in the Seventies, when films began mentioning Halloween more often. The year 1976 was a bit of a banner year in that three movies were released in which Halloween played a major role. Two were the horror movies The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane (1976) and The Clown Murders (1976). The third was the little known comedy drama Kenny & Company (1976).Kenny & Company (1976) was significant as only the second feature film directed by Don Coscarelli, who would go onto direct the cult favourites Phantasm (1979), The Beastmaster (1982), and Bubba Ho-Tep (2002). He had earlier directed the drama Jim the World's Greatest (1975).  It was also significant in featuring Reggie Banister and A. Michael Baldwin, both of who would go onto star in Phantasm. In Kenny & Company, Reggie Banister played the teacher Mr. Donovan, while A. Michael Baldwin would play Kenny's best friend Doug.Kenny & Company takes place over the four days leading up to Halloween. It centres on twelve year old boy Kenny (Dan McCann), his best friend Doug (A. Michael Baldwin), and their neighbour kid Sherman (Jeff Roth). The movie is episodic in nature, with Kenny and Doug's preparations for Halloween being the thread that links everything together. In the course of the movie, Kenny experiences his first crush, deals with the local bully, deals with the death of his dog, witnesses a fatal car crash, and, of course, celebrates Halloween. The movie climaxes with Halloween, during which Kenny, Doug, and Sherman go to a neighbour's haunted house and pull a trick on an elderly neighbour, and ends with Kenny and Doug finally besting the bully.In making Kenny & Company, Don Coscarelli wanted to portray the everyday life of a twelve year old boy, drawing upon his own childhood to do so. At the same time he recognized the importance of Halloween for children, which may even overshadow Christmas in its significance for kids. Having written the screenplay for Jim the World's Greatest with Craig Mitchell, Kenny & Company was the first screenplay Don Coscarelli wrote all by himself.Kenny & Company was truly a family affair. Don Coscarelli's father, Dac Coscarelli and his mother Kate Coscarelli both served as producers on the movie. Kate Coscarelli also played Kenny's mother in the film. It was Don Conscarelli's sister who designed the costumes Kenny, Doug, and Sherman wore for Halloween. As to Don Coscarelli himself, he not only wrote, directed, and produced Kenny & Company, but he also served as the film's cinematographer and editor. When it came time to find a distributor for Kenny & Company, Universal Pictures, who had distributed Don Conscarelli's previous movie, Jim the World's Greatest, showed little interest in Kenny & Company. Don Coscarelli found a distributor for Kenny & Company in 20th Century Fox, who expressed interest in the movie as a late summer release. Unfortunately, 20th Century Fox decided to market Kenny & Company directly to children. In his book True Indie: Life and Death in Filmmaking, Mr. Coscarelli says that the film's tagline, \"Get ready to have a happy day...Kenny & Company are coming your way!\" did them no favours. Indeed, the posters for Kenny & Company from 1975 must seem odd to anyone has seen the movie. The emphasis seems to be on skateboards, with only one photo on the poster referencing Halloween (the centrepiece of the movie). The over all impression that the posters for Kenny & Company give of the film is that it's a light-hearted comedy, when in truth it is a comedy drama that sometimes deals with such serious subjects as the nature of death.Given 20th Century Fox's promotion of Kenny & Company, it should come as no surprise that at test screenings it did very well at daytime matinees, but played to empty theatres during evening showings. Ultimately, Kenny & Company would not play in such major markets as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Needless to say, Kenny & Company did not do well at the box office.While Kenny & Company did not do well in the United States, it proved to be an outright phenomenon in Japan. Released there in 1978, the film did very well at the box office in Japan. A. Michael Baldwin, Dan McCann, and Jeff Roth went on a tour of Japan, where they were met by crowds of adolescents everywhere they went. While Kenny & Company was dead on arrival in the United States, it was very much a hit in Japan.Kenny & Company may not be well known beyond fans of Don Coscarelli, but it would prove to be influential nonetheless. Not only did the movie feature A. Michael Baldwin and Reggie Banister, who would go onto star in Phantasm, but Kenny & Company would even inspire Phantasm. During test screenings Don Coscarelli noted the reactions of audiences during the Halloween sequence and it occurred to him that he should make a horror movie. Of course, that horror movie was Phantasm.Kenny & Company was also ahead of its time. While Hollywood had churned out several movies about teenagers through the years, there was a time that movies about young adolescents and pre-teens were not particularly common. Kenny & Company was unique at the time in focusing on a twelve year old. It was then the forerunner of such movies as Over the Edge (1979),. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), A Christmas Story (1983), and Stand By Me (1986).Even today, Kenny & Company is not seen often. Its only DVD release was in 2005 and it is out of print. On Amazon it sells for a hefty $59.56. It is not available on any streaming services, unless one counts a copy that someone uploaded to YouTube. This is unfortunate not simply because of the significance of Kenny & Company in film history, but because it is a very fine movie. Speaking as someone who was close to the same age in 1976 as the characters in Kenny & Company, it realistically captures childhood in the Seventies. Indeed, with the exception of the absence of those awful Ben Cooper costumes, I think many Seventies kids will see their own childhoods in the Halloween sequence. With only a few exceptions (such as 1944's Meet Me in St. Louis), no movie captures the spirit of Halloween as well as Kenny & Company.Of course, the movie benefits not only from a good screenplay, but from its cast as well. A. Michael Baldwin does well as Doug, the one kid who is not afraid to talk back to adults. As Kenny, Dan McCann portrays the sort of kid many might have known in the Seventies. Reggie Banister does a great job as Mr. Donovan, Kenny and Doug's slightly eccentric teacher. My favourite character in the film is Doug's father, Big Doug, a Secret Service agent with a sense of humour. Big Doug is played by Ralph Richmond, who has a surprisingly short filmography.Ultimately, Kenny & Company is more than a movie that would lead to Phantasm or even a forerunner of Eighties movies about adolescents. It is a fine comedy drama that captures both the fun and stress of childhood perfectly. While people who grew up in the Seventies might appreciate it best, I think even Zoomers would love the film. Kenny & Company is still rarely seen today, but it really should be much more readily available."},
{"title": "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet Radio Show: \"Haunted House\"", "date": "Friday, October 28, 2022", "text": "Harriet & OzzieThe TV show The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet is probably well remembered by many people of a certain age. Indeed, until It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia broke its record last year, at 14 seasons it was the longest running live action sitcom. What is not as well remembered is that before it aired on television, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet was a radio show that ran from October 8 1944 to June 18 1954. Both the television show and the radio show centred on the every day life of Ozzie Nelson, his wife Harriet Hilliard, and their sons David and Ricky.Like many radio shows before it and like the TV show after it, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet would have episodes dedicated to Halloween. Among these was \"Haunted House,\" which aired on October 31 1948. \"Haunted House\" begins with David and Ricky getting ready to go trick or treating. Here they must explain trick or treating to Ozzie, although oddly enough later in the episode he does seem to be familiar with the concept. It is while Ozzie and his sons are discussing trick or treating that he tells the boys that when he was a boy they would visit haunted houses on Halloween. He also mentions the old MacAdams house as one that could be haunted, and the boys think it would be a good idea if he visited it. After the boys go trick or treating, Harriet sends Ozzie to get candy at the drug store, and he encounters their friend Thorny (John Brown) on the way. Once home Ozzie tells Harriet that he is going to the old MacAdams house. Unfortunately, along the way he encounters Emmy Lou (Janet Waldo), one of their little neighbour girls, who tells him how the MacAdams house is haunted by one of the original owner's dead suitors, a Scotsman named MacTavish. The story scares Ozzie so that he decides not to go to the MacAdams house after all. Once home he tells Harriet that he didn't go to the MacAdams house, and she finally convinces him to go by agreeing to go with him.\"Haunted House\" is notable not simply because it was one of the Halloween episodes of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, but because it features one of the earliest references to trick or treating in American popular culture. Although today it might seem like it is a long established custom, trick or treating would not emerge until the 20th Century. The first reference to trick or treating anywhere is in the the November 4 1927 issue of the Herald (published in Lethbridge, Alberta). From Canada it would spread to the Western United States and the Midwest in the early to mid-Thirties, and from there to the East Coast. This is probably why David and Ricky have to explain to Ozzie the whole idea of trick or treating. As a relatively new phenomenon, there might have been listeners who were unfamiliar with it. It is because trick or treating was a rather recent development that references to the custom were rare in American popular culture in the Thirties and Forties. Arsenic and Old Lace (released in 1944, but filmed in 1941) would be the first movie to reference trick or treating. Following World War II, trick or treating would be referenced on various radio shows. Trick or treating played a central role in the plot of the November 1 1946 episode, \"Halloween Show\", of The Baby Snooks Show.  With regards to radio, the year 1948 would seem to be a banner year for trick or treating.  The same night that The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet episode \"Haunted House\" was aired, The Jack Benny Program also aired an episode featuring trick or treating, \"Jack Goes Trick or Treating.\"Of course, \"Haunted House\" was not the only Halloween episode of the radio version of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. The episode \"Halloween Party\" aired on October 27 1950. Halloween episodes would not be unknown on the television version of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet either. In fact, the very first Halloween episode of the television version of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, \"Halloween Party,\" was only its fifth episode. The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet would make the transition to television on October 3 1952. The radio show would continue to air along side the radio show until 1954, finally ending its run on June 18 1954. While The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet only ranked once in the top thirty during its long run (it came in at no. 29 during the 1963-1964 season), it was popular enough to last 14 seasons. Although I have to think many younger viewers are unfamiliar with the show, it remains popular to this day."},
{"title": "The Beverly Hillbillies: \"Trick or Treat\"", "date": "Thursday, October 27, 2022", "text": "The Beverly Hillbillies was the smash hit of the 1962/1963 season. In fact, it would be the first show in the history of American television to hit no. 1 in the Nielsen ratings for the year in its first season. It would be with its sixth episode that The Beverly Hillbillies hit no. 1 in the ratings for the first time. That episode also happened to be the show's only Halloween episode, \"Trick or Treat.\" Like many episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies, \"Trick or Treat\" deals with multiple subplots. In the primary subplot Granny (Irene Ryan) is complaining that people in Beverly Hills are so unfriendly that they never come calling. It is for this reason that she wants to return to the hills. Jed (Buddy Ebsen) then notes that they haven't visited any of their neighbours either, and convinces Granny that they should go calling on their neighbours. It being Halloween, their neighbours think that the Clampetts are dressed in costume for trick and treating, and shower them with candy. In the second subplot, Jed's cousin Pearl (Bea Benaderet) visits Jed's old cabin in pursuit of oil man John Brewster (Frank Wilcox). While there, Pearl's daughter Jethrine (body by Max Baer Jr. and voice by Linda Kaye Henning) gains a suitor in the form of Jasper \"Jazzbo\" Depew (Phil Gordon).\"Trick or Treat\" would be a historic episode for more than being the first episode of The Beverly Hillbillies to hit no. 1. First, it marks the first appearance of Jazzbo Depew, who would eventually become Jethrine's long-term beau. Second, it marks the first reference to Hooterville, later the setting of The Beverly Hillbillies creator Paul Henning's other shows, Petticoat Junction and Green Acres. While flirting with Jethrine, Jazzbo mentions a dance in Hooterville. Not only is this the first reference to Hooterville, but it is also the first time that viewers learn Hooterville is near the Clampetts' home in the hills.If there is one caveat that I have with \"Trick or Treat,\" it's that it doesn't seem very likely to me that Jed and his kin would not know what Halloween is. Back in the hills, Mr. Brewster asks Pearl and Jethrine if they are dressed for Halloween. Pearl doesn't seem to know what Halloween is. Similarly,in Beverly Hills,  the Clampetts seem to be unaware that the day is Halloween. Of course, as anyone who has ever watched Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) knows, Halloween was a well-established tradition in Missouri by the early 20th Century. My father used to tell my brother and me about the many pranks he and his friends would pull on Halloween. The Ozarks were no different than any other part of Missouri, with Halloween celebrated there as early as the late 19th Century.  This was also true of the portion of the Ozarks in Arkansas. This should come as no surprise, given the Ozarks were heavily settled by Scots and it was the Scots who brought the holiday as we know it to North America.Now I know there are some who might question that the Clampetts were from Missouri, but throughout the series there are several clues that they were. In the very first episode, \"The Hillbillies of Beverly Hills,\" we are told that Jed's cabin is in the Ozarks. Now this could easily be in northern Arkansas rather than southern Missouri, but there are other clues making Missouri the more likely location. Joplin is mentioned more than once on The Beverly Hillbillies. In the second season episode, Jed brags that the Clampetts are dressed as well as any executive in New York City or Joplin. In the eighth season episode \"The Clampetts in New York,\" downtown New York City is said to be bigger than downtown Springfield or even downtown Joplin. In the eighth season the Clampetts return to the hills, where they visit Silver Dollar City, an amusement park outside Branson, Missouri. Other Missouri places mentioned on the show are Springfield, Taney County, and Branson. When a city outside of Missouri is mentioned, it's usually one in a neighbouring state. An example of this is Eureka Springs, which is just across the border in Northern Arkansas. Given the show's creator Paul Henning was from Missouri, it would make sense if the Clampetts were from that state.Even if the Clampetts were from the Ozarks in Northern Arkansas, as mentioned above, it seems unlikely that they wouldn't know what Halloween was. Of course, while it seems likely that the Clampetts would have been aware of Halloween (and probably celebrated it), they might not have known what trick or treating was. Trick or treating originated in the 20th Century. The first known reference to trick or treating is from Canada in the November 4 1927 issue of the Herald (published in Lethbridge, Alberta). From Alberta it would spread to the Western United States and the Midwest. It would take the better part of the 1930s for trick or treating to reach the East Coast of the United States. Given how far behind the Clampetts were on popular culture (they were still watching silent movies back in the hills), they might not know what trick or treating is.While it might not seem realistic for the Clampetts to be ignorant of Halloween, \"Trick or Treat\" is still a very funny episode. And as mentioned above, it is also a very historic one. It marked the first time the show hit no. 1, as well as the first time Hooterville was every mentioned. The only Halloween episode of The Beverly Hillbillies would then be pivotal in the history of the show."},
{"title": "The 1965 Halloween Episode of Shindig! ", "date": "Wednesday, October 26, 2022", "text": "Shindig! was a rock/pop music show that aired on ABC from September 16 1964 to January 8 1966. The show is notable in that it featured keyboardists Billy Preston and Leon Russell as part of its house band, not to mention Teri Garr as one of its dancers (she also danced on Shindig!'s rival show Hullabaloo on NBC). Among the show's regulars were also The Blossoms (led by Darlene Love) and The Wellingtons (now perhaps best known for performing the theme song for Gilligan's Island). Today Shindig! is perhaps best remembered for two things. The first is that The Who made their debut on American television on its October 2 1965 episode. The second is its Halloween episode, on which Boris Karloff was the guest host and Ted Cassidy, as the Addams Family's butler Lurch, was among the guests. On the episode Boris Karloff performed a portion of \"Monster Mash,\" while Lurch performed his novelty song \"Do the Lurch.\"Shindig! was the creation of Los Angeles disc jockey Jimmy O'Neill, who would also host the show,  his wife, songwriter Sharon Sheeley, British television producer Jack Good, and Art Stolnitz, It largely made it to the air because of the failure of another music show. ABC's folk music show Hootenanny. Hootenanny tumbled in the ratings after the British Invasion brought an end to the early Sixties folk revival. In its first season Shindig! proved popular, actually holding its own against CBS megahit The Beverly Hillbillies. In fact, it proved successful enough that NBC debuted its own rock/pop music show, Hullabaloo, and it inspired such syndicated  rock/pop music shows as Shivaree and Hollywood a Go-Go.For its second season ABC began airing Shindig! twice a week. Having aired on Wednesday night in its first season, it now aired on Wednesday night and Saturday night. The historic Halloween episode of Shindig! aired on Saturday, October 30 1965. Beyond guest host Boris Karloff, guest Ted Cassidy, and guest Bobby Sherman, I seriously doubt many today would recognize many of the guests on that night's show. Jim Doval & The Gauchos were a Fresno, California band that released several singles in the early to mid-Sixties, as well as one album, The Gauchos Featuring Jim Doval. Jackie & Gayle were Jackie Miller and Gayle Caldwell. The duo released a few singles in the mid-Sixties, and saw much more success as members of The New Christy Minstrels. The Spokesmen were a vocal trio who released singles from 1965 to 1967, as well as one album, The Dawn of Correction. The 1965 Halloween episode of Shindig! began ordinarily enough with Billy Preston playing keyboards, followed by Bobby Sherman performing a medley of The Beatles' songs \"Help!\" and \"I'm Down.\" This was followed by a performance of \"Get on the Right Track, Bobby\" by Jackie & Gayle, Ted Cassidy as Lurch, The Blossoms, and The Spokesmen. Host Jimmy O'Neill then introduced guest host Boris Karloff. This was followed by performances of \"Tell Me What You're Gonna Do\" by Jim Doval and The Gauchos, \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\" by Jackie & Gayle, \"Memphis\" by Bobby Sherman, and \"There But for Fortune\" by The Spokesmen. It is then that Boris Karloff, seated in a chair, recites a \"fairy tale\" called \"Peppermint Twist.\" Afterwards there were performances of \"Some Enchanted Evening\" by The Wellingtons and \"Bonie Maronie\" by Jim Doval and The Gauchos. Sadly, for whatever reason, film of Boris Karloff's performance of a portion of \"Monster Mash\" appears to be lost.  This situation is both curious and sad, as Shindig! is one of the best preserved of all the rock/pop music shows of the Sixties. In fact, its episodes appear to be largely intact except for the missing footage from the 1965 Halloween episode. Fortunately, someone recorded Boris Karloff's performance on a reel to reel tape, so we at least have the audio of the performance, which was part of a medley performed by multiple artists. The medley begins with Boris Karloff, backed by Jim Doval and The Gauchos, performing the first part of \"Monster Mash.\" This segues into Jim Doval and The Gauchos performing one of the musical interludes between the songs, after which Ted Cassidy performs the song \"Do the Lurch.\" This is followed by another musical interlude by Jim Doval and The Gauchos and \"Scully Gully\" performed by The Wellingtons. The medley ends with Jim Doval and The Gauchos performing \"Out of Sight.\"Here I should discuss the song \"Do the Lurch.\" \"Do the Lurch\" was a novelty record by Ted Cassidy as Lurch, released on Capitol Records in late 1965. The song was written by Gary Paxton, who had produced The Hollywood Argyles' novelty song \"Alley Oop,\" as well as singing lead vocals on the song, and the classic \"Monster Mash.\" Ted Cassidy as Lurch had earlier performed \"The Lurch\" on the syndicated rock/pop music show Shivraree that September.Despite the exposure \"Do the Lurch\" received on television, not to mention the popularity of The Addams Family, \"Do the Lurch\" failed to chart.  For ABC Ted Cassidy appearing on Shindig! probably meant good business sense. Like Shindig!, The Addams Family aired on ABC, so Mr. Cassidy's appearance on Shindig! was a clever bit of cross-promotion. The 1965 Halloween episode of Shindig! closed with a bit between Jimmy O'Neill, Ted Cassidy (as himself rather than as Lurch), and Boris Karloff, and Mr. Karloff announcing next week's guests. Over the closing credits, Bobby Sherman performed \"You Can't Sit.\" Sadly, Shindig! would last only a few months after its legendary 1965 Halloween episode. The change in the show's time slots had seriously impacted its Nielsen ratings. The Saturday edition of Shindig! performed particularly poorly. This should have come as no surprise, given its primarily teenage audience probably went out on Saturday night. ABC cancelled Shindig! at mid-season. Its Thursday night time slot was filled by the second weekly episode of Batman, which would prove to be an outright phenomenon. Its Saturday night time slot would be filled by elderly sitcom The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, which had forfeited its Wednesday night time slot to, you guessed it, the first weekly episode of Batman.Regardless, the 1965 Halloween episode of Shindig! would be well remembered by those who saw when it first aired and would become a legend for those of us who were either too young to remember it or simply weren't born yet. Indeed, it is something of a touchstone for both fans of Boris Karloff and fans of The Addams Family.Update: I want to thank Robert M. Roberts in his comment for pointing out that the big finale of the 1965 Halloween episode of Shindig!, including Boris Karloff's performance of \"Monster Mash,\" has recently resurfaced. Someone uploaded it to YouTube on October 10 of this year. Sadly, it is with a gigantic watermark in the middle of the screen. Regardless, individuals can finally see it. You can watch it here."},
{"title": "The Halloween Tree (1993)", "date": "Tuesday, October 25, 2022", "text": "Ray Bradbury is one of the best known authors of the 20th Century. He is also an author who worked in motion pictures and television, and whose works have been adapted several times over for both the big and small screen. Among his best known works is his 1972 novel The Halloween Tree. What is not as well is known is the 1993 television movie adaptation of the novel that first aired on October 2 1993 on the cable channel ABC. It was perhaps only fitting that The Halloween Tree would be adapted to the small screen, as it had originated as a television project. As hard as it might be to be believed, The Halloween Tree grew out of the disappointment Ray Bradbury and his daughters experienced upon watching the debut of the now classic It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown in 1966. In a 1967 interview, Ray Bradbury addressed his disappointment with It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, saying, \"I thought the Great Pumpkin was just dreadful. So mean. It was dreadfully mean, to anticipate the ‘Great Pumpkin’ arriving for a half hour and when it was over my kids sat there, and they were depressed. And so was I. I thought it was dreadful of Mr. Schulz not to know that you can’t build up this kind of need in people to see the Great Pumpkin, and not have him show up one way or another. It’s a shame. I thought he knew better.\"Ray Bradbury later discussed his disappointment in It's the Great Pumpkin,, Charlie Brown with his friend, legendary animator Chuck Jones, at lunch. He would later give Mr. Jones a painting of an tree with pumpkins hanging from its branches that he had made a few years before. The two men then conceived a half-hour Halloween television special that would address the history of the holiday. Unfortunately, MGM closed down its animation division and fired everyone, including Chuck Jones. Ray Bradbury and Chuck Jones's Halloween television special would never be made. Mr. Bradbury then took his teleplay and expanded it into the novel The Halloween Tree. The novel followed eight children, ready to go trick or treating, who discover a friend's life is on the line. Ultimately, with the help of the mysterious Mr. Moundshroud, the children find themselves pursuing their friend through a history of Halloween and similar holidays, from ancient Egypt to Mexico during the Day of the Dead.Over the next several years various studios would have options on The Halloween Tree. Eventually Hanna-Barbera, not long after Ted Turner had taken over the animation studio optioned the novel. Ray Bradbury wrote the teleplay for the special, which simplified the plot of the novel by reducing the number of children from eight to four. Ray Bradbury also narrated the telefilm. Leonard Nimoy provided the voice of Carapace Clavicle Moundshroud. The composer on The Halloween Tree was John Debney, who had also provided the music for another Halloween movie released the same year, Hocus Pocus (1993). He would later be nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Score for The Passion of the Christ (2004). The Halloween Tree won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Writing in An Animated Program and was nominated for the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Children's Program. It also received largely positive notices from critics.While The Halloween Tree was produced by Hanna-Barbera, it is a far cry from their Saturday morning cartoons. The animation on the special is superior for a made-for-TV animated film, with often lavish backgrounds and imagery. The Halloween Tree itself is very impressive. The voice talent also does a remarkable job of bringing the characters to life, particularly Leonard Nimoy. He is virtually unrecognizable as Mr. Moundshroud. What really places The Halloween Tree above other television specials is Ray Bradbury's script. For the most part the teleplay is fairly faithful to the novel, and, as might be expected of a teleplay by the great Mr. Bradbury himself, captures the magic of his writing perfectly. The only caveat I have is a flaw shared by the novel as well. In including Día de Muertos, I fear that it might reinforce the misconception that many have that the holiday is merely \"Mexican Halloween.\" While both Halloween and Día de Muertos have roots in Allhallowtide, and Halloween originated as a \"day of the dead,\" the two holidays evolved separately and differ in some significant ways.After its debut on ABC, The Halloween Tree would air regularly at Halloween on both TBS and the Cartoon Network. Turner Home Entertainment released the TV movie on VHS in the Nineties. In 2012 the Warner Archive released it on DVD. It is currently available to watch for free with commercials on the streaming service Tubi and for rent on several other streaming services. The Halloween Tree may not be as famous as other Halloween specials, but there is every reason it should be. It is a finely produced television movie that numbers among the best of Halloween fare that has aired on American television. And it is among the few adaptations of a Ray Bradbury work that actually captures the magic of his writing."},
{"title": "Retro Halloween Commercials", "date": "Monday, October 24, 2022", "text": "Halloween advertising has existed in print for well over 100 years. It was then natural that with the rise of television there would be Halloween commercials. I am not sure how far Halloween commercials go back in the history of the television, but I know it is at least the Sixties and I have to suspect there were even Halloween commercials in the Fifties. Below are five old Halloween commercials I gathered from YouTube. The quality of many of them is poor, but then I suspect that they were probably digitalized from old video tapes that had seen better days.First up is a commercial for Shasta Orange Soda. It is from the Seventies, but I have no idea what year. I believe the store clerk is none other than John Fiedler, now best known as the voice of Piglet in Disney's \"Winnie the Pooh\" cartoons and Juror No. 2 in 12 Angry Men (1957).One can tell this next commercial is old simply from the fact that it is for Woolworth's and Woolco. Woolworth's closed its department stores in 1997. This particular commercial is from 1978. Notice the Star Wars costumes, not to mention the other old Ben Cooper costumes.This Wrigley's Gum commercial is from 1979.And here is a Hershey's commercial from 1981.Finally, here is a Toys \"R\" Us ad from 1985. You'll notice the kids are still wearing costumes of the type manufactured by Ben Cooper. Ben Cooper didn't have too many years left. It would close its doors in 1991. As to Toys \"R\" Us, they closed down just a few years ago, in 2018."},
{"title": "Seinfeld: The Cheever Letters", "date": "Saturday, October 22, 2022", "text": "Vanessa MarquezThis coming Friday it will have been thirty years since the Seinfeld episode \"The Cheever Letters\" first aired. The episode aired on Wednesday, October 28 on NBC. While not as well known as such Seinfeld episodes as \"The Contest,\" \"The Soup Nazi,\" \"The Merv Griffin Show,\" or \"The Calzone,\" \"The Cheever Letters\" was in many ways a pivotal episode for the show. It is an important episode to me because it marked the only guest appearance of my dearest Vanessa Marquez on the show. It was also the first time she played an adult role after playing juvenile roles in film and TV shows. It was also one of her earliest guest appearances on television.\"The Cheever Letters\" was written by Seinfeld co-creator Larry David, Elaine Pope, and Tom Leopold. Like many episodes of the show, \"The Cheever Letters\" featured multiple subplots, some of which carried over from earlier episodes. One of these subplots that carried over from earlier episodes was Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld) and George (Jason Alexander) continuing work on the television sitcom pilot they are developing for NBC. Two other subplots carry over from the previous episode, \"The Bubble Boy,\" in which Kramer (Michael Richards) is careless with a cigar and as a result burns down the cabin owned by the parents of George's girlfriend Susan (Heidi Swedberg).The first of these subplots resulting from the cabin burning down is the fact that George and Susan must break the bad news to her parents (Warren Frost and Grace Zabriskie). They do so at a dinner with her parents, and her father takes it very badly. He goes into another room sobbing. It is later, when Jerry and George visit Susan's parents to return her sunglasses, that a doorman (David Blackwood) delivers a metal box, the only thing that survived the fire at the cabin. As it turns out the metal box contains letters between novelist John Cheever and Susan's father detailing their rather torrid affair.The second subplot that grew out of the burning of the cabin in \"The Bubble Boy\" is the loss of Kramer's source for Cuban cigars. As a cigar connoisseur who prefers Cubans, Kramer is distraught about the cigars having burned up, and requests that George ask Susan's father for more of them. When George fails to do so, Kramer decides to find a new source on his own and visits the Cuban diplomatic mission at the United Nations. There he strikes a deal with the diplomats in which he trades his jacket to one of them for more Cuban cigars. This is the subplot in which my dearest Vanessa Marquez appears. She plays the receptionist at the Cuban diplomatic mission.Finally, a fourth subplot deals with Jerry complaining about Elaine's assistant Sandra (Lisa Malkiewicz) being overly chatty. Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) then asks Sandra to not be so talkative with Jerry, whereupon Sandra quits. Elaine asks Jerry to call Sandra and take back what he had said by claiming that Elaine misconstrued his comments. It was while Jerry and Sandra are on the phone that Sandra asks him out. Jerry agrees to a date, which goes badly after Jerry says something to her that, to paraphrase George, is \"not offensive\" but is \"abnormal.\" This subplot ends with what might be the best line in \"The Cheever Letters,\" a zinger delivered by Elaine towards Jerry. This particular subplot was based on an actual experience by writer Tom Leopold, in which he said the exact same thing to a date that Jerry had, with a similar reaction from his date.\"The Cheever Letters\" was shot on September 22 1992 in front of a live studio audience at CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles. When it first aired, it received a Nielsen rating of 11.1 with an audience share of 17. Here I should point out that the John Cheever who gives \"The Cheever Letters\" its title was an actual novelist, who lived from 1913 to 1982. He was known for writing four novels: The Wapshot Chronicle, The Wapshot Scandal, Bullet Park, and Falconer (which George is reading at the end of the episode). He also wrote the novella Oh What a Paradise It Seems and several short stories. It was following his death that his daughter Susan Cheever revealed in her memoirs (Home Before Dark) that her father had affairs with both women and men. This would be confirmed by John Cheever's own journals and letters. The idea that Susan's father had an affair with John Cheever is then not very far-fetched.As I mentioned earlier, while not as well known as some other Seinfeld episodes, \"The Cheever Letters\" is significant to the show for several reasons. \"The Cheever Letters\" would mark the very first time that Susan's parents appeared on the show. Strangely enough they would not appear again until the seventh season episode \"The Rye,\" their marriage apparently having survived the revelation that Mr. Ross had an affair with John Cheever. \"The Cheever Letters\" would also mark the first credited guest appearance of actor Timothy Omundson, who played Susan's brother Ricky. Timothy Onmundson would go on to have regular and recurring roles on the TV shows Judging Amy, Psych, Galavant. and This is Us. Curiously, this was the only time that Susan's brother Ricky ever appeared on the show. He was absent even for major plot lines.Lisa Malkiewicz was not the only actress considered for the role of Elaine's assistant Sandra. Dedee Pfeiffer (Michelle Pfeiffer's sister, later a regular on Cybill and currently a regular on the show Big Sky) and Kim Gillingham (earlier a regular on the short-lived show One Big Family) also auditioned for the part. Both actresses would later appear in Seinfeld episodes, Dedee Pfeiffer in the fifth season episode \"The Opposite\" and  Kim Gillingham in the fifth season episode \"The Puffy Shirt.\"\"The Cheever Letters\" was Vanessa Marquez's second guest appearance on a TV show, following an appearance on the short-lived Tequila and Bonetti earlier in the year. While Vanessa was Mexican in descent, it was the second time she played a character of Cuban descent. She was set to have a recurring role as Consuelo Burns, the niece of the new lead character Michael Santana (Steven Bauer), on the TV show Wiseguy, but the show was cancelled before her episodes and never aired. They would be seen in syndication and would be released on the fourth season DVD set of Wiseguy in 2009. Both Michael Santana and hence Vanessa's character were Cuban in descent.Vanessa never related any memories of her guest appearance on Seinfeld, other than saying it was one of the more pleasant experiences in her career. Given how briefly she appears on the episode (she appears for around a minute or two and has only a few lines), I have to think she did not spend much time on the Seinfeld set. Vanessa did say that out of everything she had ever done, \"The Cheever Letters\" was the most consistent in delivering residuals to her, even beating out Stand and Deliver (1988). This should be no surprise, given how often it has aired since Seinfeld entered syndication.  Here I have to once more point out that \"The Cheever Letters\" was the first time that Vanessa Marquez played an adult character. Before the episode, she had played teenagers in the movies Stand and Deliver and Night Children, the TV movies Sweet 15 and Locked Up: A Mother's Rage, and on the TV shows Wiseguy and Tequila and Bonetti.\"The Cheever Letters\" was the eighth episode of the fourth season of Seinfeld, the season in which the show finally broke into the mainstream. It was during the season that NBC moved Seinfeld from Wednesday to Thursday night, which resulted in a rise in the show's ratings. For the first time since it debuted, Seinfeld ranked in the top 30, coming in at no. 25 for the year. It was also the year that several of the show's best known episodes aired, including \"The Bubble Boy,\" \"The Contest,\" \"The Outing,\" and \"The Junior Mint.\"\"The Cheever Letters\" may not be as well known as any of those episodes, but, as pointed out above, it was a pivotal episode for the show. It marked the first appearance of Susan's parents. It also gave Timothy Onmundson the first credit of what has been a very successful career. It would only be a few years later that he appeared on Judging Amy and Psych. And while Vanessa Marquez only appears briefly in the episode, it marked the first time she played an adult role and gave her more exposure than she had since Stand and Deliver. It would only be two years later that she would return to NBC on Thursday nights as Nurse Wendy Goldman on ER. On a personal level, I also think it is one of the all-tme funniest Seinfeld episodes. There are some truly hilarious bits here, from George delivering the bad news about the cabin to Susan's parents to Kramer at the Cuban Diplomatic Mission at the UN to the revelation that Susan's father had an affair with John Cheever. And the zinger Elaine directs at Jerry at the end of the show is one of the best closes to an episode of the entire run. Indeed, the line received such an enthusiastic and prolonged response from the audience that it had to be buffered and truncated  when the episode was edited. During its fourth season Seinfeld truly came into its own, and \"The Cheever Letters\" is proof of that."},
{"title": "Donald Pleasence as Prince John on The Adventures of Robin Hood", "date": "Friday, October 21, 2022", "text": "(This post is part of the Devilishly Delightful Donald Pleasance Blogathon Hosted by Realweedgiemidget Reviewsand Cinematic Catharsis) Today Donald Pleasence may be best known as Blythe, \"The Forger,\" in The Great Escape (1963) and Blofeld in You Only Live Twice (1967). Not many people may remember that he played the villainous Prince John on the 1950s ITV television series The Adventures of Robin Hood. It was Donald Pleasence who originated the role on the series, and he would appear four times as Prince John on the show.For those who may be unfamiliar with The Adventures of Robin Hood, it was set in England at the time King Richard the Lionheart was away on the Crusades and Prince John was ruling in his stead. It centred on the legendary outlaw Robin Hood (Richard Greene) and his band of merry men as they opposed the machinations of the corrupt Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Wheatley) in Sherwood Forest and the surrounding area. Although it was not the first British television show to air in the United States, it was the first to be a major hit there, paving the way for Danger Man, The Avengers, The Saint, and many others to come. It debuted in the United Kingdom on September 25 1955. In the United States it aired on CBS and debuted on September 26 1955. The Adventures of Robin Hood proved incredibly successful, inspiring such similar series as The Adventures of Sir Lancelot, The Buccaneers, and The Adventures of William Tell. It also produced a great deal of merchandise on both sides of the Pond. Ultimately, it ran for four seasons and has persisted as a syndicated rerun ever since.Throughout the series, the Sheriff of Nottingham was often acting on the orders of Prince John, but Prince John would not appear until the final episode of the first season. In \"The Prisoner\" a rumour has spread that King Richard has died in the Crusades. Taking advantage of the rumour, Prince John imprisons a courier who has arrived with news that Richard is alive, and then sets to have himself crowned King of England. Fortunately, Robin Hood gets wind of the plot. In the episode Prince John makes for a sharp contrast to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Although scheming and villainous, Prince John is a coward at heart and would rather hide than face Robin in combat. Not only was Prince John on The Adventures of Robin Hood dishonestly and cowardly, he also apparently lacks other morals as well. In the second season episode \"Isabella,\" John plots to set his current wife, Princess Avice (Helen Cherry), aside and marry the French princess Isabella (Zena Walker). John's hope is that once he does so, the French king will recognize him as the rightful King of England. Fortunately, Princess Avice alerts Robin Hood to the plot.What might have been Prince John's most sinister plot occurs later in the second season. In \"Ambush\" Prince John plots for Prince Arthur (Peter Asher, later of Peter & Gordon fame), the son of Prince John and King Richard's brother Geoffrey whom Richard had designated as the heir to the throne, to die in an \"accident.\" As might be expected, Robin Hood learns of the plot and takes action to protect the young prince. Here I have to point out that historically Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, was indeed the son of Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, and King Richard the Lionheart did appoint him as his heir apparent. What eventually happened to Duke Arthur remains a mystery to this day, but there are historians who think Prince John had a hand in it.Donald Pleasence appeared one final time as Prince John on The Adventures of Robin Hood in the third season episode \"Marian's Prize.\" In \"Marian's Prize,\" while the Sheriff of Nottingham is away, Prince John is in Nottingham and arranges for an archery contest in order to trap Robin Hood. As it turns out, Robin Hood and Little John (Archie Duncan) are off on a hunting trip. The merry men then set up their own archery contest, to see which of their number should compete in Prince John's contest in Robin's stead. They let Marian (Patricia Driscoll) compete in their contest and, as it turns out, she is the best archer among them. She then competes in Prince John's archery contest disguised as a boy. \"Marian's Prize\" differs a bit from the earlier episodes featuring Prince John, which play out almost like medieval spy dramas. \"Marian's Prize\" is a bit more straight forward and, in fact, the episode could have easily been done with the Sheriff of Nottingham as the villain.Donald Pleasence was not the only actor to play Prince John on The Adventures of Robin Hood. Hubert Gregg played Prince John in two third season episodes. He had earlier played the character in the 1952 movie The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men. Brian Haines played Prince John in a single, third season episode. While others played the role on the show, it was Donald Pleasance who originated the role and he was the one who played it the most.Aside from his guest appearances as Prince John, Donald Pleasence also made one other guest appearance on The Adventures of Robin Hood.  In \"A Village Wooing,\" Robin and the merry men seek to help Wat Longfellow (Leslie Phillips), win the hand of the Widow Winifred (Betty Impey). Unfortunately for Wat, Bailiff Baldwin, played by Donald Pleasance, also has his eye on the widow. Baliliff Baldwin is a very different character from Prince John. Although a stickler for the rules and more than a bit superstitious and a little underhanded, Baldwin was not evil in the way John was. Donald Pleasence did an extraordinary job of playing Prince John, and it is easy to see how he would later become a movie star. He is barely recognizable as John, having a full head of hair and a beard. Of course, once Donald Pleasence as Prince John speaks in any given episode of The Adventures of Robin Hood, it is no mistaking him for anyone but Donald Pleasence. To Prince John, Donald Pleasence brought just the right amount of knavery, conceit, and cowardice. Prince John lacks the Sheriff of Nottingham's bravery, but he more than makes up for it in the depths to which he will stoop to get the throne. While both Hubert Gregg and Brian Haines made for acceptable Prince Johns, neither of them were as good as Donald Pleasence. If Donald Pleasence excelled in playing such villains as Blofeld in You Only Live Twice and Himmler in The Eagle Has Landed (1976), it is perhaps because he got plenty of practice on The Adventures of Robin Hood."},

His father was a physician, who also served as a forensic surgeon with the police, while his mother was a pianist and teacher.  He attended Belmont House School in Newton Mearns and then  Glenalmond College in Perthsire. He attended the Glasgow School of Art, where he studied painting.

He also appeared in the movies From Hell (2001), On the Nose (2001), Van Helsing (2004), Ocean's Twelve (2004), Provoked: A True Story (2006), Stormbreaker (2006), and The Brother's Bloom (2008). He was the voice of Gregory in The Tale of Despereaux (2008) and the title character in Gooby (2009). On television he guest starred on the TV shows Frasier and Still Game. He appeared in the mini-series Murderland. He also reprised his role as Fitz in the final Cracker special in 2006. In the Teens Robbie Coltrane played Hagrid in the final \"Harry Potter\" movie,  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two (2011). He appeared in the movies Great Expectations (2012) and Effie Gray (2014). He was the voice of the lead elf in Arthur Christmas (2011) Lord Dingwall in Brave (2012). He guest starred on the TV shows Yes, Prime Minister and Urban Myths. He appeared in the mini-series National Treasure.Robbie Coltrane was a talented and versatile actor. This can be demonstrated by looking at his two best known roles. Fitz on Cracker was cranky, caustic, and foul-mouthed, and tended to smoke, drink, and gamble far too much. Hagrid in the \"Harry Potter\" movies was about as far removed from Fitz as one could get. Hagrid was soft-hearted, loved animals (both magical and otherwise), friendly, and loyal to his friends. Ftiz and Hagrid were not isolated cases either, as he often played characters who were dramatically different from each other. In Henry V (1989) he played John Flastaff, the vain, overly boastful knight who spend much of his time drinking. In Nuns on the Run, he played small-time hood Charlie McManus who goes on the run disguised as a nun with his buddy Brian Hope (Eric Idle). In two \"James Bond\" movies he played Russian gangster and former KGB Valentin Zukovsky. Robbie Coltrane was an incredible actor who portrayed a wide variety of characters. What is more, he always gave a good performance."},

{"title": "The High Chaparral", "date": "Saturday, October 15, 2022", "text": "Even today Latinos are underrrepresented in the media. While Latinos make up 18.7% of the population in the United States according to the last census, they account for only 3.1% of all leading roles on television. In the Sixties Latino representation was much worse. Latinos rarely appeared on television and when they did, it was usually in Westerns where they were often portrayed as stereotypical Mexican bandidos or hot-tempered señoritas. When the Western television series The High Chaparral debuted, it was then positively revolutionary. Half of the lead characters were Mexican (even though they weren't played by actors of Mexican descent), and some of the supporting characters were as well. What is more, they were not presented as stereotypes, but as three-dimensional characters whose personalities were not entirely defined by preconceived notions about their ethnicity.The High Chaparral centred on the ranch of the same name, so named for the chaparral that grew in the area. In the pilot John Cannon (Leif Erickson), his wife  Anna-Lee (Joan Caulfield), his son Billy Blue (often called \"Blue Boy,\" he was played by Mark Slade), and his brother Buck (Cameron Mitchell) settled the ranch, located near the border between Arizona Territory and Mexico. Anna-Lee was killed not long after they settled there in an attack by the Apaches. With the Apaches a constant threat, John Cannon had to enter into an alliance with Don Sebastian Montoya (Frank Silvera), who owned a large ranch on the Mexican side of the border. As a condition of the alliance, Don Sebastian required John to marry his daughter, Victoria (Linda Cristal).  Victoria's brother, Manolito (Henry Darrow), who did not get along particularly well with her father, accompanied his sister to her new home. Blue Boy initially did not approve of the marriage, although he grew to appreciate it in time. Although they married for reasons other than love and there was 30 years difference in their ages, John and Victoria grew to love each other as well.The High Chaparral was the creation of David Dortort, who had also created what may be the most famous ranch Western of them all, Bonanza. David Dortort wanted to produce a Western where a son did not get along with his father, which would make it quite different from Bonanza. At the same time he thought Latinos did not get enough exposure on television and, when they did, too often they were portrayed as stereotypes. The end result of these two ideas was The High Chaparral, on which Blue did not particularly get along well with his father John and Mexican characters played large roles.The pilot for The High Chaparral was shot in the summer of 1966. What set the pilot for The High Chaparral apart from any pilots before it is that it was meant to air in two parts, each an hour long with commercials. According to news reports at the time, it was the first two-part pilot ever. As might be expected, the pilot was expensive for television at the time. It cost $600,000. At the time David Dortort thought that if the pilot did not sell, then he could release it as a feature film. At the time he assumed the role of Big John Cannon, Leif Erickson already had a long career. He had been appearing in movies since the Thirties and had appeared in such movies as On the Waterfront (1954) and Strait-Jacket (1964). Before playing Buck Cannon on The High Chaparral, Cameron Mitchell had also had a long career in film and television. He had starred on the short-lived British series The Beachcomber. Prior to playing Billy Blue, Mark Slade had been a regular on the short-lived show The Wackiest Ship in the Army and had guest starred on such shows as Gomer Pyle: USMC and Mr. Novak.Despite the fact that their characters were Mexican, some of the actors playing members of the Montoya family were not even Latino. Although she grew up in Argentina, Linda Cristal was either born to a French father and an Italian mother or to Spanish parents. She had an impressive film career prior to playing Victoria on The High Chaparral, appearing in such films as The Perfect Furlough (1958) and The Alamo (1960). Frank Silvera, who played the recurring role of Don Sebastian Montoya, was Jamaican in ancestry. Throughout his career he had played a variety of ethnicities, although more often than not he played Latin characters. Of the Montoyas, the one character played by a Latino was Manolito Montoya. Henry Darrow was born Enrique Tomás Delgado in New York City to Puerto Rican parents. Initially using the stage name \"Henry Delgado,\" he switched to the name \"Henry Darrow\" to avoid typecasting. Prior to The High Chaparral, he had made several guest appearances on television from Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea to Gunsmoke.On many ranch Westerns on television it was often the case that ranch hands rarely appeared. Indeed, on David Dortort's own Bonanza it sometimes seemed as if the vast Ponderosa was ran by only four men. This was not the case with The High Chaparral, on which one of the lead characters was a ranch hand and several of the recurring characters were also ranch hands. Don Collier played the foreman of the High Chaparral, Sam Butler. Don Collier had been one of the leads on the Western television series Outlaws and had made several guest appearances on television shows. While Sam Butler was a regular character on The High Chaparral, there were several other ranch hands who appeared in several episodes and appeared from the beginning of the show to its very end. Among these was Sam's brother Joe (Bob Hoy). Prior to The High Chaparral Bob Hoy had made several guest appearances on Bonanza and The Wild Wild West. Pedro was another ranch hand at the High Chaparral who appeared frequently on the show. He was also played by one of the only two semi-regular actors on the show who were actually Mexican in descent. Roberto Contreras was the son of director Jaime Contreras, who was born in Oaxaca, Mexico. Prior to The High Chaparral, Roberto Contreras had guest starred on several TV Westerns. The other semi-regular actor on The High Chaparral who was Mexican in descent was Rodolfo Acosta, who played Vaquero on the show. Like Roberto Contreras, Rodolfo Acosta had appeared on several TV Westerns prior to The High Chaparral. Among the other ranch hands who appeared on The High Chaparral from time to time were Reno (Ted Markland) and Ira (Jerry Summers).The High Chaparral was filmed on location at Old Tucson Studios in Arizona, as well as  Saguaro National Park in Arizona. Shooting in Arizona presented some problems, as in the summer temperatures could easily rise above 100 degrees. Other exteriors were shot around California, in such places as Red Rock Canyon State Park and Bronson Canyon. All interiors and some of the exteriors were shot at Warner Bros. in Burbank, with scenes shot on Laramie Street on the back lot and Studios 20 and 25 at Warner Bros.The theme of The High Chaparral was composed by David Rose, who served as the composer on Bonanza (although its famous original theme was composed by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans). In fact, he drew upon the score he had composed for the fifth season Bonanza episode \"The Pressure Game\" in writing the theme to The High Chaparral.For a show that had a large ensemble, The High Chaparral had very few changes in its cast. Mark Slade left at the end of the third season. He was 28 when the show began and was over thirty by the third season. Quite simply, he was too old to convincingly play a teenager. Frank Silvera died shortly after the end of the third season. Don Sebastian was written out of the show as having died. He willed Rancho Monotya to his brother, Don Domingo (played by Mexican acting legend Gilbert Roland). While The High Chaparral never ranked in the top thirty shows for the year, it did relatively well in the ratings for most of its run. It proved phenomenally successful in Europe, where it was the number one show there for a time. In Sweden a song titled \"Manolito,\" about the character from The High Chaparral, was even written and recorded by singer/songwriter Thore Skogman. The High Chaparral can still be found in syndication in Europe.The High Chaparral would end its run with its fourth season. Its last original episode aired on March 12 1971. The reasons for the cancellation of The High Chaparral seem to have been manifold. Its ratings were no longer as high as they had once been. It was also an expensive show to produce. The average episode cost $225,000 to produce. Another possible factor in the cancellation of The High Chaparral may have been the fact that the 1970-1971 season was the year of the Rural Purge, at which time the networks purged themselves of shows that appealed primarily to rural audiences, older audiences, or both. It was mostly CBS that cancelled rural shows and shows that appealed to older audiences, although both NBC and ABC did their share of cancellations of such shows. NBC cancelled The Men from Shiloh (the new title of the long running Western The Virginian) because its audience was too old. Given Westerns have traditionally appealed to an older audience, it is possible that The High Chaparral fell victim to the networks' obsession with the 18-49 demographic. Finally, it is possible that The High Chaparral fell victim to a moral panic over violence on television that had emerged after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. During the 1968-1969 season CBS had cancelled The Wild Wild West as a scapegoat in the moral panic over television violence. Sadly, the networks tended to identify the Western genre with violence. In an article published in the Pittsfield Berkshire Eagle, the Corpus Christi Caller Times, and other newspapers in mid-March of 1969, an ABC executive uses the fact that the network had eliminated all Westerns from their schedule as an example of their efforts to reduce violence on television. It is possible that NBC saw cancelling The High Chaparral as a means of reducing television violence on the network.While The High Chaparral ended after four seasons, it would remain popular through the years. In addition to local television stations, it has been shown on such TV outlets as the Family Channel, the Hallmark Channel, INSP, and Heroes & Icons. The first three seasons have been released on DVD in the United States, and the entire run has been released on DVD in Europe. Although not as well known as such ranch Westerns as Bonanza and The Big Valley, The High Chaparral maintains a large following to this day.Much of the reason The High Chaparral remains popular is that it was different from any other ranch Western on the air. The very fact that many of its characters were Mexican and were not played as stereotypes would set it apart from other Westerns of the time. While Victoria was strong-willed and had a temper, she was no stereotypical, fiery señorita. Indeed, she was responsible for much of the day-to-day running of the High Chaparral. And unlike a certain other ranch Western, when Victoria was captured she would not wait for the men to rescue her, but would figure out her own way to escape her captors. Similarly, Manolito was no stereotype either. Manolito was brave, intensely loyal to his friends and family, and he would always come down on the side of the oppressed. Even the Mexican ranch hands, such as Pedro and Vaquero, were not portrayed as stereotypes. Contrary to the \"lazy Mexican\" stereotype, they not only work hard, but they enjoy their work. Here it must be pointed out that Big John and Victoria had one of the few mixed marriages on television at the time. At a time when Latinos were rarely seen on television, The High Chaparral was positively revolutionary at the time in its portrayal of Latinos. Even more so than Bonanza, The High Chaparral was sympathetic towards Native Americans. While the Apache were presented as a threat to both the High Chaparral and Rancho Montoya, they were treated with respect and as characters with their own motivations. For the most part, they were not portrayed as simple stereotypes, a sharp contrast to many of the Western television series of the Fifties. Of course, another way in which The High Chaparral differed from other ranch Westerns is that it was much a grittier show. The characters on The High Chaparral did not always get along. Particularly in its early seasons, it was not unusual for Blue to fight with his father John, something the sons on Bonanza or The Big Valley rarely did. Even Victoria and Manolito, who were usually devoted to each other, would have arguments. In comparison to Bonanza and The Big Valley, The High Chaparral could be a very violent show. While the show was always centred around its characters (both the regulars and guest stars), it was at its core an action show. Gunfights and fisticuffs were not unknown in its earlier seasons.The High Chaparral was one of the last Westerns on American television and it was a groundbreaking one at that. It featured Latinos in non-stereotypical roles at a time when Latinos were rarely seen on television. It also treated other ethnicities, from the Apache to Irish miners, with sympathy. At the same time, it was very effective as an action/adventure show. The High Chaparral may not be as well known as The Big Valley, let alone Bonanza, but there is every reason it should be."},
{"title": "The 50th Anniversary of the TV Series Kung Fu", "date": "Friday, October 14, 2022", "text": "It was fifty years ago today, October 14 1972, that the TV show Kung Fu debuted on ABC. Kung Fu would prove to be a success. For its first season it ranked no. 29 out of all the shows on the air. For its second season it ranked no. 27 out of all the shows on the air. It also seems likely that the show was at least partly responsible for triggering a kung fu/martial arts fad that lasted from 1973 to 1974. It maintains a cult following to this day.Kung Fu centred on Shaolin priest Kwai Chang Caine (David Carradine), who was forced to flee China after killing his teacher's murderer (who just happened to be the Emperor's nephew). He then wandered the Old West, searching for his American half brother Danny Caine. All the while, Caine was pursued by bounty hunters and often faced injustice in his travels, forcing him to use his martial arts skills. Kung Fu grew out of a movie treatment written by comedy writer Ed Spielman. Ever since had seen the movie Seven Samurai (1954), Mr. Spielman had been fascinated by East Asian culture. He wrote a movie treatment about legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi. In the original draft of the movie treatment, Miyamoto Musashi travelled to China where he was taught kung fu by a Shaolin monk. It was around 1967 that he showed the treatment to his writing partner, Howard Friedlander, who was fascinated by the character of the Shaolin monk. It was Howard Friedlander who suggested that instead of a movie about Miyamoto Musashi, Ed Spielman instead focus on a Shaolin monk wandering the Old West. The two then set to work on the treatment, eventually titled The Way of the Tiger, The Sign of the Dragon. It was in 1969 that Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander submitted their jokes, along with  the movie treatment, to Peter Lampack, an agent at the Howard Morris agency. While Peter Lampack was not impressed by Messrs. Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander's jokes, he was interested in the treatment about a Shaolin monk wandering the Old West. Fred Weintraub, an Executive Vice President at Warner Bros., also took an interest in the The Way of the Tiger, The Sign of the Dragon. He had Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander write a screenplay based on the treatment in 1970. Unfortunately, Fred Weintraub was not able to stir up much interest at Warner Bros. in the project.Fortunately, it occurred to Fred Weintraub that The Way of the Tiger, The Sign of the Dragon could be turned into television movie. It would be Jerry Thorpe and writer Herman Miller who would take Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander's screenplay and turn it into a ninety-minute teleplay for a television movie. Now simply titled Kung Fu, the TV movie aired on ABC on February 22 1972 as a Movie of the Week. The TV movie Kung Fu proved successful enough that ABC greenlit a TV series. Ever since the publication of Linda Lee's memoir about her husband, Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew, some have assumed that it was actually Bruce Lee who created the TV series Kung Fu. In many ways, it is understandable why some would assume this. It was in 1971 that Tom Kuhn, the head of the television division at Warner Bros., offered Bruce Lee a deal to develop his own television series. Among other ideas, Mr. Lee came up with the idea of a Shaolin monk named Ah Sahm who travelled the Old West helping the oppressed. Originally titled Ah Sahm, Bruce Lee retitled it The Warrior and submitted the proposal to Warner Bros. Ultimately Bruce Lee did not sign the contract for his development deal with the studio because of the success of the first film to star Bruce Lee in a lead role, The Big Boss (1971). With a movie career in the offing, there was no reason for his to star in his own television show. Given Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander's original movie treatment dated to 1969, it seems more likely that any similarities between Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander's concept and Bruce Lee's concept were purely coincidental. Indeed, there were some differences between the two. Caine is only half Chinese and is searching for his half-brother. Ah Sahm was fully Chinese and was simply wandering the West helping the oppressed. Here it must be pointed out that the idea of \"Far East Meets Old West\" was not unknown in the Sixties and early Seventies. The 1971 movie Red Sun starred Toshiro Mifune as a samurai seeking to retrieve a sword owned by the Japanese ambassador in the Old West. Still yet earlier, the 1960 Wanted: Dead or Alive episode \"Black Belt\" involved bounty hunter Josh Randall (Steve McQueen) tracking a karate expert accused of killing his employer. The 1963 episode The Rifleman \"The Sixteenth Cousin\" featured a cousin of the Japanese Emperor and his bodyguard, a skilled samurai. That Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander as well as Bruce Lee came up on the idea of a Shaolin monk wandering the Old West separately is then not at all far-fetched.Regardless, Bruce Lee was considered for the role of Caine on Kung Fu. He had played Kato on the single season show The Green Hornet and later appeared on the TV series Longstreet. It was Longstreet that sparked Warner Bros.' interest in him for the show. Ultimately, Bruce Lee was not cast as Caine because Tom Kuhn felt his accent was too thick for a series lead. Other actors of Asian descent were considered. Mako was considered for role, but ultimately it was thought his accent was too thick as well. He later made a guest appearance on the show. George Takei, then as now best known as Sulu on Star Trek, was also considered, but it was ultimately decided he was the wrong physical type.After having considered various actors of Asian descent for the role of Caine, the producers then looked elsewhere for an actor to play Caine. James Coburn, William Smith, and John Saxon were all considered for the role. Ultimately, David Carradine, who was decidedly not Asian in descent, was cast as the half-Chinese Kwai Chang Caine. The casting of David Carradine would result in controversy even before the Movie of the Week aired. The Association of Asian Pacific American Artists filed a formal complaint against the casting of Mr. Carradine on the grounds of unfair hiring practices. They demanded that David Carradine be replaced by an actor of Asian descent and that a Chinese history advisor be hired. While the producers would hire an advisor on Chinese history, David Carradine remained in the role of Caine on Kung Fu. While a white actor played a half-Chinese actor on Kung Fu, the show would provide Asian and Asian American actors with more roles than they ever had been on American television. Kung Fu would often involve flashbacks to Caine's life at the Shaolin monastery, which often involved his teachers there, including his mentor Master Po (Keye Luke) and Master Chen (Philip Ahn). Other Asian actors would have recurring roles on the show, including James Hong, Victor Sen Yung, Richard Loo, and Yiki Shimoda. The show featured guest appearances ranging from actors Benson Fong to Nancy Kwan. As mentioned earlier, Kung Fu proved to be successful in its very first season. There was some merchandising associated with the show. As might be expected, King-Seely put out a Kung Fu lunchbox. Topps issued a set of 60 bubblegum cards associated with the show. There were even at least three novels based on the show, credited to Lee Howard (a house pen name, the actual author was Barry N. Malzberg).For its third season ABC moved Kung Fu from the Thursday night time slot to a new Saturday night time slot where it was opposite The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Bob Newhart Show on CBS. Its ratings then faltered and for the first time it did not rank in the top thirty shows for the year. It would not be ratings that would end Kung Fu, but instead its star. After three seasons on the show, David Carradine decided it was time to leave for multiple reasons. Indeed, he had warned the producers that the third season would be his last.Kung Fu remained popular after ending its network run and enjoyed some success in syndication. In 1986, the television film Kung Fu: The Movie aired. The film introduced a son Caine did not know he had, Chung Wang (Brandon Lee). The following year the TV movie Kung Fu: The Next Generation aired. This movie was set in the present and centred on a descendant of Caine, Kwai Chang \"Johnny\" Caine (Brandon Lee). It was in 1993 that the TV series Kung Fu: The Legend Continues debuted in first run syndication. The series starred David Carradine as a Shaolin monk and a descendent of Caine who fights crime alongside his son Peter Caine (Chris Potter).In 2021 a new series, Kung Fu, debuted on The CW. Although called a reboot, Kung Fu (2021) actually has very little in common with the original series. The series is set in present day San Francisco, and the show's lead character, Nicky Shen (Olivia Lang) is in no way connected to the Kwai Chang Caine of the original series. Furthermore, Nicky does not wander the United States, but instead fights evil in San Francisco. Regardless, the show has been well received by critics and has done well in the ratings for a show running on The CW. While it only lasted three years, Kung Fu would have a lasting impact. It seems likely that the show helped spark the kung fu craze of the Seventies. Kung Fu debuted in the fall of 1972. It was in March 1973 that the Hong Kong  movie King Boxer (AKA 5 Fingers of Death) reached the top ten movies at the box office in the United States. It would soon be followed by yet other kung fu movies produced in Hong Kong that dominated the American box office. In turn, there would be comic books and magazines dedicated to East Asian martial arts. The \"kung fu craze\" would last well into 1974. The \"kung fu\" craze would forever alter American action movies, comic books, and television shows, with characters from Batman to Buffy the Vampire Slayer being skilled in East Asian martial arts. While it is possible the \"kung fu craze\" would have taken place had Kung Fu never aired, it seems likely that the show kick-started it.Kung Fu was not a perfect show by any means. Casting David Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine amounted to nothing more or less than yellow face. The show often had inaccuracies with regards to Chinese history and culture. The show would even err with regards to the Shaolin temple, with its priests quoting Taoism and Confucianism when in truth they are Buddhists. Regardless, Kung Fu did give many Asian actors the opportunity to appear in television in major roles. What is more, those roles were rarely, if ever stereotypes. While Kung Fu was certainly a flawed show, it remains popular to this day and would have a lasting impact on American popular culture."},
{"title": "The Late Great Angela Lansbury", "date": "Wednesday, October 12, 2022", "text": "Dame Angela Lansbury, the acclaimed actress who was nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in her film debut in Gaslight (1944), played Eleanor Shaw in The Manchurian Candidate (1962), and played mystery novelist Jessica Fletcher in the TV series Murder, She Wrote, died yesterday, October 11 1922, at the age of 96. Angela Lansbury was born on October 16 1925 in Regent's Park, London. Her father was politician Edgar Lansbury and her mother was Northern Irish actress Moyna Macgill. She spent her early life in Poplar, East London and then Mill Hill, North London. Her father died of stomach cancer when she was nine and her mother later remarried. She attended Hampstead School for Girls where she took part in school plays. She studied acting at Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art in Kensington, West London, and passed with honours from the Royal Academy of Music. It was at the start of World War II that her mother moved with  both her and her younger brothers (Bruce Lansbury, who would become a well-known television producer, and his twin Edgar Lansbury, who also became a producer) to the United States. Angela Lansbury attended the Feagin School of Dramatic Art in New York City and graduated in 1942. She went to work in nightclubs as a singer, also doing imitations of comedy actress Beatrice Lillie.

She appeared on Broadway in Gore Vidal's The Best Man. She appeared in the mini-series Little Women.  Later this year she will appear in the movie Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. Angela Lansbury was extremely versatile, so much so that she was described a \"character actress\" from when she was very young. While she might be best known as Jessica Fletcher on Murder, She Wrote, she played  wide variety of roles throughout her career. She was the flirtatious, young maid in Gaslight (1944). She played dance hall girl Em in The Harvey Girls tavern singer Sibyl in The Picture of Dorian Gray. In The Court Jester she was the beautiful, but scheming Princess Gwendolyn. While today when many people think of Angela Lansbury playing older roles, when she was young she could and did play attractive, young, and even flirtatious characters. Of course, even when Angela Lansbury was young she was playing characters older than she was. In Samson and Delilah she played Semadar, the older sister of Delilah, despite the fact that Hedy Lamarr was around ten years older than she was. Angela Lansbury was only ten years older than Elvis Presley, but played his mother in Blue Hawaii. It is well known that Angela Lansbury was only three years older than Laurence Harvey, yet he played her son in The Manchurian Candidate. The Manchurian Candidate is a mark of just how great an actress Angela Lansbury was. After playing a seductive maid in Gaslight and before playing the sweet-natured Jessica Fletcher on Murder, She Wrote, she played one of the greatest villains in movie history. As played by Angela Lansbury, Eleanor Shaw was absolute evil.Angela Lansbury wasn't simply a great actress, but she was also a gifted singer as well. This can be seen in her musical roles in movies, from The Harvey Girls to Beauty and the Beast. It is little wonder that two of her best known roles on Broadway were in musicals, Mame and Sweeney Todd.Given the length of her career, the many high-profile films in which she appeared, and her sheer talent as an actress, Angela Lansbury was well-loved in the classic film buff community. Classic film buffs also loved her for her well-known kindness. Miss Lansbury always had time for her fans and she treated with both warmth and respect. Over the years many fans met her, and all of them said that she was among the nicest people one could meet. Angela Lansbury may have played some of the most villainous characters on screen, but  in reality she was a true lady."},
{"title": "The 60th Anniversary of McHale's Navy", "date": "Tuesday, October 11, 2022", "text": "It was sixty years ago today, on October 11 1962, that McHale's Navy debuted on ABC. At a time when ABC trailed behind both CBS and NBC in the ratings, McHale's Navy was one of their more successful sitcoms. It ultimately ran for four seasons. McHale's Navy starred Ernest Borgnine as Lt. Commander Quinton McHale, commander of the U.S. Navy PT boat PT-73 in the South Pacific during World War II. Stationed on a small island opposite Taratupa where they saw little in the way of action, Lt. Commander McHale and his men spent more time dreaming up money making schemes than fighting the Japanese. It was for this reason McHale often found himself at odds with his commanding officer, Captain Binghamton (Joe Flynn), who is always trying to get enough evidence on McHale and his men to put them in the brig permanently. If McHale's Navy sounds a bit like The Phil Silvers Show (AKA Sgt. Bilko), it should be kept in mind that it was produced by Edward J. Montagne, who had been a producer on The Phil Silvers Show.It might surprise many to learn that the sitcom McHale's Navy actually originated as a very serious, World War II drama that had aired as an episode of Alcoa Premiere. The episode, \"Seven Against the Sea,\" aired on April 3 1962 and starred Ernest Borgnine as Quentin McHale, the commander of PT-73 in the South Pacific during World War II. The relative peace that McHale and his men had been enjoying is disrupted by the arrival of a new executive officer,  Durham (Ron Foster), whose job it it is to get the base back to fighting the war. Naturally McHale and Durham clash, until word comes that a battalion of United States Marines are under siege. While \"Seven Against the Sea\" had some humour, it was firmly a drama and had a very serious tone for the most part. Reportedly, \"Seven Against the Sea\" was a pilot for a show to be titled McHale's Men, although in later interviews Ernest Borgnine has said that Durham was to be the main character on the show. The point may have been moot, as \"Seven Against the Sea\" sparked little interest at Revue Productions. It was Jennings Lang, Vice President of MCA TV Limited (the parent of Revue) who suggested that instead the show be done as a situation comedy. Ultimately, McHale's Navy would retain only two members of the cast of \"Seven Against the Sea.\" Aside from Ernest Borgnine as Lt. Commander McHale, it also kept Gary Vinson as George \"Christy\" Christopher, the quartermaster on the PT-73, and John Wrighat as radio man Willy Moss, a Southerner who also operated their still. The rest of the cast of McHale's Navy would be entirely different from \"Seven Against the Sea.\" Joe Flynn joined the show as Captain Biunghamton. Also joining the show was Bob Hastings, as Lt. Carpenter, Captain Binghamton's assistant who is utterly incompetent despite trying to do everything by the book. Tim Conway joined the show as McHale's second in command, Ensign Charles Parker. Mr. Parker was naive, more than a bit bashful, and utterly mild mannered. He also tended to be inept. While Parker is hardly a good officer, he is so likeable that the crew of the PT-109 take measures to protect him. The rest of McHale's crew is rounded out by a diverse group of personalities. Lester Gruber (Carl Ballantine) was the PT-79's torpedo mate, an amateur magician and con man who is always concocting money making schemes that nearly get them put in the brig. The crew was rounded out by Machinist Mate Harrison James \"Tinker\" Bell (Billy Sands), Gunner's Mate Virgil Edwards (Edson Stroll), and Seaman Joseph \"Happy\" Haines (Gavin MacLeod). Staying with McHale and his crew is Fujiwara \"Fuji\" Takeo Kobiashi, a Japanese naval seaman and prisoner of war who had deserted from the Japanese Imperial Navy. He has no loyalty to the Japanese military and is entirely faithful to the crew of PT-79. They in turn hide him from Captain Binghamton and any other military officers (both American and Japanese). McHale's Navy did respectably well in the ratings, particularly for a show on third rated ABC. For it second season it ranked no. 22 for the year in the Nielsens. For its third season it ranked at no. 29 for the season. Over all, McHale's Navy would be successful to have two feature films spun off from it. The first was McHale's Navy (1964), released at the end of the second season. In the film the crew of the PT-79 find themselves deep in debut after Gruber's horse betting scheme doesn't pan out and Ensign Parker destroys both the cargo and dock belonging to a rich businessman. Ernest Borgnine would be absent for the second film, McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force (1965) because of filming on Flight of the Phoenix (1965). In the film, after switching uniforms with a U.S. Air Force officer, Parker is mistaken for an Air Force officer. Aside from Ernest Borgnine, most of the cast appears in McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force, except for Carl Ballanine as Gruber.McHale's Navy underwent very little in the way of cast changes. Of McHale's crew, only Gavin MacLeod left. He departed from the series at the end of the second season to appear in the movie The Sand Pebbles (1966). The show featured several recurring characters, including Roy Roberts as Admiral Rogers, Jane Dulo as Nurse Nancy Turner, and Henry Beckman as Colonel Harrigan.While McHale's Navy underwent very little in the way of cast changes, in its fourth season it entirely changed its location. The crew of PT-79, as well as Captain Binghamton and Lt. Carpenter, were all transferred to the fictional Italian town of Voltafiore. In an interview in 1965 with TV Guide writer Peter Bogdanovich (yes,the one who would become a movie director), producer Si Rose said, \"After three years in the Pacific, we thought the Allied and Japanese forces had had enough of McHale. You know, new enemy, new relationships, a new dimension for McHale.\" As it was, the move perhaps turned out to be a bad idea for the show. After ranking in the top thirty for the past two seasons, ratings for McHale's Navy dropped low enough that it was cancelled at the end of its fourth season. Of course, things did not help that it aired opposite The Red Skelton Hour on CBS and Dr. Kildare on NBC.McHale's Navy was gone, but hardly forgotten. It proved to be a success in syndication. The entire run of the show has also been released on DVD and it is available on streaming. In 1997 a film very loosely based on the TV series McHale's Navy was released, with Tom Arnold as Lt. Commander McHale. McHale's Navy (1997) received overwhelming negative reviews (on Rotten Tomatoes it boasts a rating of 3% based on 29 reviews) and it also bombed at the box office. McHale's Navy was very much a product of its time. To a degree Fuji fits the stereotype of the passive, accommodating East Asian male.   Some of the other Japanese characters appearing on the show also conformed to stereotypes. It was not unusual for McHale and his crew to refer to the Japanese as \"Nips,\" today considered an ethnic slur (here it must be pointed out that it appears in movies about World War II of the time). The native islanders are also often stereotypes of the sort often seen on Gilligan's Island. Although a good deal of progress had been seen in the previous decades, the Sixties were still a time when ethnic stereotypes were often seen on American television.Regardless, McHale's Navy would have a lasting impact on the career of Tim Conway, even though he is better known for The Carol Burnett Show today. It was McHale's Navy that first brought him to prominence and gave him his first role in a feature film, reprising the role of Ensign Parker in the two McHale's Navy movies. The short-lived sitcom The Tim Conway Show re-teamed Tim Conway and Joe Flynn as co-owners of a charter plane company. Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway would later provide the voices of superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy on the animated TV series SpongeBob Squarepants. Today McHale's Navy does not necessarily count among the best known sitcoms. It is perhaps best remembered as a vehicle for Ernest Borgnine, up until that time an actor in feature films. Even so, it stands as one of ABC's few successes in the early Sixties and it remains a very funny sitcom. In 1963 both Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway would be nominated for Emmy Awards. Although it is not as well remembered as it once was, McHale's Navy remains one of the better comedies to emerge from the early Sixties."},
{"title": "The Ring (1952)", "date": "Saturday, October 8, 2022", "text": "Rita Moreno & Lalo RiosFor most of the Golden Age of Hollywood, individuals of Mexican descent were rarely seen on the silver screen. When they did appear in a movie, they were often portrayed as gross stereotypes, such as the bandido or lazy Mexican. This began to change after World War II, when movies focusing on Mexican Americans began to appear. Among these movies was the low budget film The Ring (1952). Now known for featuring Rita Moreno in her first lead role, The Ring (1952) was among the first movies to deal with discrimination against Mexican Americans. The Ring (1952) centred upon Tomas Cantanios (Lalo Rios), a young Chicano living in East Los Angeles. After his father was laid off from his job and following a street fight, Tomas is discovered by boxing manager Pete Ganusa (Gerald Mohr). Tomas then begins boxing to make money for his family under the Anglicized name Tommy Kansas, against the wishes of his father (Martin Garralaga) and his girlfriend (Rita Moreno). The Ring (1952) was based on the novel The Square Trap by Irving Schulman, who also wrote the movie's screenplay. The novel's trip to the big screen began in the late Forties. The October 1 1949 issue of Box Office reported that Filmmakers Inc., the independent film company founded by actress Ida Lupino, producer Collier Young, and screenwriter Malvin Wald, would produce Pachuco, a movie based on a novel by Irving Schulman, to be distributed by RKO. Filmmakers Inc. never did produce the movie Pachuco. Eventually, the screen rights to the novel would be purchased by King Brothers Productions, an independent film company that had produced such films as Dillinger (1945) and Gun Crazy (1950). In 1951 King Brothers Productions submitted the screenplay, under the title The Ring is a Trap, to the Production Code Administration. The title was eventually shortened to simply The Ring.What set The Ring (1952) apart from its contemporaries, let alone earlier movies, is that it had a large Latino cast. Indeed, while Gerhard Mohr and Rita Moreno are top billed, it is Lalo Rios, playing Tomas, who is the star. The movie centres on the character of Tomas and he appears in the majority of its scenes. This makes The Ring one of the first movies to feature a Mexican American in the lead role. Lalo Rios had earlier appeared in another film that dealt with racism against Mexicans and Mexican Americans, The Lawless (1950). In the film Lalo Rios played Paul Rodriguez, a young fruit picker in California who finds himself the victim of bigotry. What separates The Ring (1952) from The Lawless is that the latter film is largely told through the eyes of a white character (Macdonald Carey as newspaper editor Larry Wilder). Sadly, Lalo Rios would never again have a major role like Tomas in The Ring (1952). For the rest of his career he appeared primarily in supporting roles and bit parts. Following The Ring (1952), his most significant role may have been Risto, the nephew of Grandi (Akim Tamiroff ) who hurls acid at Mexican special prosecutor Miguel Vargas (Charlton Heston) in Touch of Evil (1958).Tommy's love interest in The Ring (1952) is also the film's leading lady, Rita Moreno as Tomas's girlfriend Lucy. The Ring was only her fourth film and, oddly enough, only the second time the Puerto Rican Rita Moreno ever played a Latina (she played Latina runaway Dolores in So Young, So Bad in 1950 before playing a bit part in The Toast of New Orleans the same year and the first of many island girls in Pagan Love Song, also in 1950). Lucy is a significant break from earlier portrayals of women of Mexican descent in American film. For much of American film history, women of Mexican descent were portrayed as such stereotypes as hot tempered, hypersexual señoritas or submissive mamacitas. Lucy was neither of these stereotypes. Instead Lucy was a nice Mexican American girl who is not afraid of telling Tommy she disapproves of him boxing while remaining supportive of him. It is notable that while Miss Moreno has been critical of many of her early roles, she has always looked back fondly on The Ring (1952). She would later say of the film, “Everyone in the film and in the family are good people. He’s not a gangster, he’s not a bad boy. She’s a good girl. She has very traditional Mexican values. She doesn’t want him to box.\"Tommy's friends also play a significant role in The Ring, each of them played by Latino actors. For many of these actors, The Ring would be their only credit. This was not the case with Puerto Rican actor Tony Martinez. He had already appeared in three films. Later in the Fifties he would play what may be his best known role, that of Pepino in the sitcom The Real McCoys. The fact that actual Latinos played Latinos in The Ring further set it apart from many other movies of the time. Often times, individuals of Mexican descent would be played by white people in brownface or individuals of yet other ethnicities.One notable Mexican American member of the cast is Art Aragon, playing himself as the final boxer Tommy faces in the movie. Art Aragon was a lightweight boxer of Mexican descent from New Mexico. He was extremely popular in Los Angeles and even mingled with the Hollywood elite. He was friends with Audie Murphy and even reportedly dated Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield. He also appeared in a few films beyond The Ring.Of course, what truly sets The Ring (1952) apart is that it is among the very first movies to examine discrimination and racism against Chicanos. In fact, when the original screenplay was submitted to the Production Code Administration, the PCA suggested changes be made to the film's dialogue, remarking, \"We feel it would not be good to infer that the police discriminate against these boys because of their nationality.\"Despite this suggestion, some indication of racism on the part of the police against Chicanos remains in the film. Early in the film two police officers stop by Tomas and his friends' clubhouse for no other apparent reason than to harass the boys. Later in the film the boys go to a diner in Beverly Hills. There the waitress is downright rude to them and the management actually calls the police despite the fact the boys are well behaved and have done nothing wrong. Fortunately, the police officer (played by John Crawford, who later played Sheriff Ep Bridges on The Waltons) is sympathetic to the boys after he learns one of them is boxer Tommy Kansas.The Ring even portrays the little known fact that Los Angeles was a segregated city. Early in the movie, Tomas and Lucy go to the local roller rink. They are not allowed in as it is not \"Mexican night.\" Indeed, there are signs plainly posted above the box office stating a separate night for African Americans and a separate night for Mexican Americans. At least one critic reacted poorly to the presentation of racism against Chicanos and the segregation that existed in Los Angeles in The Ring (1952). The critic at The Hollywood Reporter described The Ring (1952) as  \"a depressing, rather pointless harangue on American discrimination against its Mexican minority group.\" They further claimed it offered \"such a bleak outlook for the Mexican-American that it emerges only as the type that does this country definite disservice abroad\" and claimed The Ring appeared \"to show that if a Mexican can't make good in the ring, or in some other exhibitional profession, there isn't much hope for him in this 'land of bigotry.'\" To add insult to injury, the critic indicated that its only audience would be \"East Los Angeles, the Mexican-American population and those who love films depicting minorities as abused in America.\" It is tempting to view this review as rooted in racism, particularly as The Ring (1952) portrays Chicanos in a very positive light. They are treated with dignity rather than as stereotypes, and portrayed as hard working, honest people. That it portrays the racism they faced daily in Los Angeles would not seem to me to be a legitimate criticism against it.As it is, The Ring (1953) stands as a document of Los Angeles County in the early Fifties in other ways. As an independent film made on a low budget, it was largely shot on location around Los Angeles County. Indeed, the opening shot is of historic Olvera Street. The street fight that draws Pete Ganusa's attention to Tommy took place outside what would become the Dresden Room in downtown Los Angeles in only a few years. As might be expected of a boxing movie, boxing venues do appear in the film. Both the American Legion Post 43's Hollywood Stadium and the Valley Garden Arena appear in the film. Sadly, The Ring (1952) suffered from one of the worst publicity campaigns of any movie in the Fifties. While The Ring (1952) is essentially the story of a young Chicano's personal journey, including the racism he encounters, one would not know it from the film's posters. Some might even be considered racist by today's standards.  Perhaps the worst of the lot featured the tagline \"They call me 'Dirty Mex' but still chase my women!,\" complete with a provocative illustration of Rita Moreno in a gown and Tommy in his boxing shorts and robe. Another poster, featuring Tommy on the ropes, had the tagline, \"I was slaughtered to please the crowd!,\" accompanied by another tagline, \"They called me 'Dirty Yellow Mex!'...I'm not good enough for them--but my women are!\" None of these posters truly captured The Ring (1952), which was not a violent, overly sensationalized movie at all. Lucy was a clean cut girl, not a femme fatale, while Tommy was simply a good boy seeking to find his way in the world. Contrary to its promotional material, The Ring (1952) is a very fine movie that is hardly sensationalized. It avoids most of the cliches often found even in the best boxing movies. There is no villainous boxer who fights dirty. Tommy is never asked by mobsters to take a dive. There are no corrupt promoters who cheat Tommy and Pete out of money. That is not to say that there are not things in The Ring (1952) that one hasn't seen in other films. Like many previous characters in boxing movies, Tomas comes from poverty. After several fights, Tommy does become punch drunk, which naturally becomes a cause of concern for him. Even so, these seem like natural outgrowths of the plot, and not cliches inserted into the film because they are common to most boxing movies.Indeed, in many ways The Ring is less about boxing (and less about racism against Chicanos, for that matter) than it is about Tommy's journey of self discovery. Contrary to what the critic at The Hollywood Reporter claimed in his review, there is a good deal of hope for Tommy at the end of The Ring. He still has a family that loves him. He still has a girlfriend who loves him. He still has friends who love him. At the core of The Ring is the importance of family and friends. The Ring (1952) presents Chicanos as human beings rather than stereotypes, and in doing so it became a truly pioneering film."},

{"title": "Olga San Juan, the Puerto Rican Pepper Pot", "date": "Wednesday, October 5, 2022", "text": "Before Héctor Elizondo and Raul Julia, even before Rita Moreno, there was Olga San Juan. Olga San Juan was one of the earliest Puerto Rican stars to appear in American movies. What is more, she was a true triple threat. She could sing, she could dance, and she could act. When Olga San Juan appeared in a movie, one couldn't help but take notice of her.Olga San Juan was born on March 16 1927 in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Her father was Luis San Juan, a World War I veteran whose regiment guarded the Panama Canal. After the war he returned to Puerto Rico and got married. He and his wife Mercedes later moved to New York City. The family moved back to Puerto Rico when Olga San Juan was three. When she was five they moved to Spanish Harlem in New York City. Olga San Juan's talent manifested when she was still very young. She began taking dance lessons when she was only three years old. When she was was only eleven she and other schoolchildren performed for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the White House. Growing up she was part of a Puerto Rican children's club called Infancia Hispania, of which future musician and bandleader Tito Puente was also a member. Olga San Juan and Tito Puente's mother would put together shows for the children to perform. Olga San Juan's father fell ill when she was in the ninth grade, and she was forced to leave high school to pursue work. She found it performing at such places as the Hotel Astor and the El Morocco. She was only sixteen when she became a \"Copa Girl\" at the famed Copacabana. She eventually formed her own act, Olga San Juan and Her Rumba Band. She caught the eye of Paramount Pictures, who signed her to a contract in 1943. Olga San Juan made her film debut in the short subject \"Caribbean Romance\" in 1943. She made her feature film debut the following year in a small role in Rainbow Island (1944). She had the lead role in the short \"Bombalera\" (1945), where she was dubbed \"the Cuban Cyclone\" despite being Puerto Rican. \"Bombalera\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject, Two-reel.Olga San Juan appeared in the movie adaptation of the popular radio show Duffy's Tavern (1945) before appearing in what could be considered her breakthrough role. Blue Skies (1946) starred Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. Olga San Juan played nightclub singer Nita Nova, and there was no way anyone could not take notice of her in the film. She performed the number \"You'd Be Surprised,\" as well as the duet \"I'll See You in C-U-B-A\" with Bing Crosby. She performed the song \"Heat Wave,\" during which she also danced with Fred Astaire. Miss San Juan followed Blue Skies as one of the leads in the film Variety Girl (1947), in which she performed the song \"He Can Waltz.\" She also has what may be the best scene in the film, in which she causes a ruckus in a restaurant to draw attention to herself. In Are You With It? (1948) she played the female lead opposite Donald O'Connor. In the movie she got to perform the numbers \"Daddy, Surprise Me\" and I'm Looking for a Prince of a Fella.\"  Olga San Juan would also have significant roles in One Touch of Venus (1948), The Countess of Monte Cristo (1948) and The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend (1949). In One Touch of Venus she performed \"Don't Look Now My Heart is Showing\" and \"That's Him.\" In \"The Countess of Monte Cristo\" she performed \"Count Your Blessings,\" \"Who Believes in Santa Claus,\" and \"The Friendly Polka.\" Surprisingly, she had no songs in The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend.Like other musical comedy stars, such as Ann Miller, Betty Grable, and Rita Hayworth, Olga San Juan was a popular pinup girl. Given her looks, this should come as no  surprise. Even a cursory search on Google Images reveals that Miss San Juan did pinup pictures for such holidays as Christmas, New Year's Day, Halloween, and even St. Patrick's Day. Of course, what set Olga San Juan apart from other pinup girls is that she was Puerto Rican. Quite simply, she was one of the first Latina pinups, not to mention one of the earliest Latina sex symbols.Olga San Juan also appeared on radio in the Forties and Fifties. She appeared on both Command Performance and Lux Radio Theatre. In 1951 she guest starred on Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar.Sadly, The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend would be Olga San Juan's last appearance in a major motion picture. Following her marriage to Edmond O'Brien in 1948, she largely retired from movies. That is not to say that Miss San Juan disappeared from the public eye. She played Jennifer Rumson on Broadway in Paint Your Wagon in 1951 and 1952. She also made several appearances on television in the late Forties and in the Fifties, on the shows The Ed Wynn Show, The Peter Lind Hayes Show, The Paul Whiteman's Goodyear Revue, The Kate Smith Evening Hour, Texaco Star Theatre Starring Milton Berle, The Rosemary Clooney Show, The Lux Show, and The George Jessel Show. She made a rare dramatic appearance on television in the syndicated crime drama Johnny Midnight, on which her husband Edmond O'Brien was the star, in 1960. She made one last appearance on television in 1964 on The Mike Douglas Show.Olga San Juan was nicknamed \"the Puerto Rican Pepper Pot,\" and it easy to understand how she earned that nickname when seeing her on screen. In her tiny frame Olga San Juan seemed to contain an abundance of energy, not to mention a forceful personality. When combined with her incredible voice and her talent as a dancer, it was impossible to take one's eyes off her when she was on the screen."},

That season saw the beginning of a cycle of shows set during World War II, so that Combat! was among the first shows in the Sixties set during the Second World War. It proved to be successful, receiving moderately good ratings during its network run and lasting five seasons. It would also receive a good deal of critical acclaim.Combat! followed American solders belonging to the second platoon of K Company, which was part of 361st Regiment, as they made their way through Nazi Germany following D-Day.2nd.  Lt. Gil Hanley (Rick Jason) was the commander of the second platoon, In the pilot he was a Technical Sergeant when the 361st Regiment landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day. He was promoted to second lieutenant when the platoon's original lieutenant was killed. Sgt. Chip Saunders (Vic Morrow) was the squad leader, and close friends with Lt. Hanley. With the show from the beginning to its end were various men in the squad: Private \"Caje\" LeMay (Pierre Jalbert); Private William Kirby (Jack Hogan); and Private \"Littlejohn\" (Dick Peabody). Their original medic was Doc Walton (Steven Rogers), who disappeared without explanation after the first season. He was replaced by Doc (Conlan Carter), whose full name was never given. He remained with the show for the rest of its run. Private Billy Nelson (Tom Lowell) and Private Braddock (played by comedian Shecky Greene) were only on the show in its first season.The Fifties saw a start of a prolonged cycle towards World War II that would last into the Seventies. It should then come as no surprise that the 1962/1963 season saw the start of a cycle towards TV shows about World War II with three different shows set during World War II debuting that season. The Gallant Men debuted only a few days after Combat! and centred on American soldiers fighting in Italy during the Second World War. It only lasted one season. More successful was McHaley's Navy, a sitcom centred on the crew of a PT boat based in the South Pacific. It ran for four seasons. It would be the success of Combat! that would lead to other World War II dramas, including 12 O'Clock High, The Wackiest Ship in the Army, and The Rat Patrol.Combat! was created by screenwriter Robert Pirosh. He had collaborated with George Seaton on the classic Marx Brothers movies A Night at the Opera (1935) and A Day at the Races (1937). He also contributed to the musical comedy Song of the Islands (1942), the comedy Rings on Her Fingers (1942), and the classic I Married a Witch (1942). During World War II he served with the 320th Regiment, 35th Infantry Division as a Master Sergeant. He served in both the Ardennes and Rhineland campaigns. It was perhaps because of his service during World War II that following the war his focus shifted from comedies to more serious works. In 1949 his screenplay for the movie Battleground won the Academy Award for Best Story and Screenplay. He would revisit World War II with the movies Go for Broke! (1951) and  Hell is for Heroes (1962). Robert Pirosh's World War II movies are noted for their realism, and for portraying soldiers as vulnerable human beings rather than cardboard heroes.It was not long after he finished Hell is for Heroes that Robert Pirosh approached producer Selig Seligman with the idea for a television series to be called Men in Combat that follow a squad of soldiers from D-Day to the liberation of Paris. Like his movies, Men in Combat would offer a realistic depiction of war and would feature soldiers who were often vulnerable and sometimes even questioned what they were asked to do. Selig Seligman would become the show's executive producer. ABC approved a pilot for the prospective series. The pilot, \"A Day in June,\" was shot in December 1961. By that time  the prospective new show was being referred to as Combat Platoon in the press. It was in April that ABC announced it had picked up the new show, now titled Combat!.Unfortunately, Robert Pirosh would not remain with the show he created. Neither of the show's two leads, Rick Jason and Vic Morrow, particularly cared for Mr. Pirosh's pilot. Vic Morrow disliked it so much that he actually considered leaving the show before it had even begun. It following the shooting of the pilot and ABC picking up Combat! that executive producer Selig Seligman fired Robert Pirosh as the show's producer and replaced him with Robert Blees. A few other changes were also made, including dropping some of the characters. Combat! debuted to largely positive reviews. Combat! also did relatively well in the ratings. While it did not make the top thirty shows for the year in its first two seasons, in its third season it was the 10th highest rated show for the year. Combat! never did quite so well again, but it would run for another two years.Much of the success of Combat! was perhaps its emphasis on realism. Before the series began filming, executive producer Selig Seligman actually had the cast go through a week of basic training at the Army's Infantry Training Center at Fort Ord in northern California. Selig Seligman made a request to the United States Army that they assign a technical advisor to Combat!. Preferably, Mr. Seligman wanted someone who had be at D-Day. The Army Maj. Homer Jones as the show's technical advisor. He had served with the 82nd Airborne's 508th Parachute Infantry and was a veteran of D-Day. Great care was taken to sure that every American and German uniform featured on the show was accurate to the era. For the most part whenever German soldiers spoke to each other, it was in German. Beyond the accuracy with which Combat! portrayed World War II, Combat! was not so much an action show as it was a show that examined the human condition through the lens of World War II. The soldiers on the show were portrayed as human beings, subject to human frailties and sometimes wrestling with questions regarding morals and ethics.  The debut episode, \"Forgotten Front,\" had the squad having to interrogate a German soldier who was already questioning his own loyalties. \"The Celebrity\" involved a professional baseball player turned soldier who freezes during combat. In \"The Wounded Don't Cry,\" Sgt. Saunders finds himself in an uneasy alliance with a German soldier as they must travel to get plasma for a German field hospital in a French village. In point of view, Sgt. Saunders faced court martial.In addition to quality writing, Combat! also benefited from superior direction. Before the show began filming, Robert Altman, who would later establish a name for himself in feature films, was hired to direct every other episode of the first season. Ted Post, another veteran television director who would go onto feature films, also directed several episodes. Burt Kennedy, who had already written several Westerns and would establish himself as a director in the genre, also directed many episodes of Combat!. It also benefited from both good cinematography and good editing. Robert B. Hauser, the director of photography on Combat! during its first season, was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography for Television. William Mace was nominated for the American Cinema Editors Award for Best Edited Television Program for the episode \"Escape to Nowhere.\"The success of Combat! did lead to some merchandising. In 1963 Ideal Toy Company produced a Combat! board game. In 1964 Whitman Publishing produced a young adult novel titled Combat! The Counterattack by Francis M. Davis. There were also three tie-in novels written by Harold Cain and published by Lancer Publishing. The three novels (Combat! in 1963, Combat!: Men Not Heroes also in 1963,  and Combat!: No Rest for Heroes in 1965) were not particularly loyal to the TV series. After five seasons on the air, ABC cancelled Combat! in the spring of 1967. While Combat! would no longer air on the network, that would not mean that ABC would be without an hour-long, World War II drama for the 1967-1968 season. Garrison's Gorillas was also produced by Selig Seligman's Selmur Productions. In fact, the unaired pilot of Garrison's Gorillas was aired as an episode of Combat!, with Lt. Hanley introducing a group of commandos. If Garrison's Gorillas had not sold, the pilot could then air as an episode of Combat!. As it turned out, Garrison's Gorillas would not see the success that Combat! had. It ran for only one season.Following its network run, Combat! entered syndication. It proved to be successful, not only in the United States, but as far afield as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Peru, South Korea, and yet other countries. Over the years it has aired on such television venues as Encore Action and MeTV. Since 2020 it has aired on the Heroes & Icons channel. Lasting five seasons, Combat! was American television's longest running World War II drama. As mentioned earlier, it was largely the success of Combat! that led to a cycle of World War II shows (both comedies and dramas) during the Sixties. Had Combat!not been a success, it is very possible that 12 O'Clock High, The Wackiest Ship in the Army, The Rat Patrol, and Garrison's Gorillas might never had made it to the air. Combat! has also been cited as an influence by both director Steven Spielberg and actor/director Tom Hanks, and the show even had an impact on Steven Spielberg's movie Saving Private Ryan (1998). At a time when escapism was in fashion on television, Combat! offered an authentic look at World War II and emphasis on its characters. Unlike other TV shows and movies of the era, it certainly did not romanticize the war. Sixty years after its debut, Combat! stands as an extraordinary achievement on television."},

{"title": "Cheers Turns 40", "date": "Friday, September 30, 2022", "text": "It was 40 years ago today, on September 30 1982, the classic sitcom Cheers debuted in NBC. Debuting to low ratings, it became one of the most successful shows of the Eighties. Except for its first two seasons, it ranked in the top twenty for each season. For its seven seasons it ranked in the top ten. Following its original network run, it would see enormous success as a syndicated rerun. It is still seen today on local stations and cable channels.Cheers centred on the bar of the same name, located in Boston. Its owner was Sam Malone (Ted Danson), a former Major League baseball player who was also a womanizer. At the beginning of the show he hired a new waitress, Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) a graduate student attending Boston University who eventually has an on-again/off again relationship with Sam. Coach (Nicolas Colasanto) was a retired baseball coach and a bartender at Cheers who was apparently in the early stages of dementia. Carla Tortelli (Rhea Pearlman) was a  long time waitress at Cheers and the mother of five children known for not always being polite to customers. Norm (George Wendt) was one of Cheers's regulars and an accountant who is only occasionally employed. Joining the cast very early was Cliff (John Ratzenberger), another regular at Cheer and a postman who thinks he knows everything. Over the years there would be a few changes to the cast, with some characters leaving and other characters joining the cast.Cheers was created by brothers Glen and Les Charles and James Burrows. The Charles brothers had written for such shows as The Bob Newhart Show and M*A*S*H. James Burrows had directed episodes of the shows The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Bob Newhart Show. Initially the three men conceived of something along the lines of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, in which a group of co-workers behave as if they were family. They considered an American version of British sitcom Fawlty Towers, but then changed their idea to a bar, whereupon they drew upon the classic radio show Duffy's Tavern for inspiration. Different cities were considered for the location of the bar, including Barstow, California and Kansas City, Missouri. Eventually they decided to set their planned show on the East Coast and settled upon the location of Boston. They found the Bull & Finch Pub in a Boston phone book and asked the owner, Tom Kershaw, if they could shoot photos of the exterior and the interior for the show. Mr. Kershaw charged the producers only $1. The Bull & Finch Pub has since made a good deal of money from being the real-life bar upon which Cheers was modelled. Initially the character of Sam Malone was to be a former football player and former NFL player Fred Dryer was considered for the role. The part eventually went to Ted Danson, who had more experience as an actor, having appeared in soap operas and several guest appearances on prime time shows. With the casting of Ted Danson, Sam was then made a former baseball player, the producers feeling that would be more believable than having Sam a former player in the NFL. Shelly Long, who had already appeared in the movies Caveman (1981) and Night Shift (1982), and had been recommended by others to the producers. The character of Cliff was created after John Ratzenberger had auditioned for the part of Norm, which went to George Wendt. After the audition John Ratzenberger asked the producers if they planned to have a bar \"know-it-all,\" something common to most bars. As a result, Cliff Clavin was created.Cheers debuted to low ratings. Its debut episode ranked 77 out of 100 shows in the Nielsen ratings for the week. Over the coming weeks, ratings did not rise particularly well either. Fortunately, Brandon Tartikoff, then president of NBC, saw something in the show and protected it from cancellation. The ratings for Cheers rose during the summer and it ultimately ranked no. 74 for the year. Its ratings improved immensely in its second season, so that it ranked no. 34 for the season. Its ratings would rise more in its third season, when it came in at no. 13 for the year. By its fourth season Cheers was one of the most popular shows on the air. It ranked no. 5 that season and would remain in the top ten for the rest of its run.Over its eleven seasons, Cheers would evolve. The early seasons centred a good deal on the relationship between Sam and Diane, which modelled largely after the relationship between characters played by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in their movies. Over time Cheers became more of a ensemble show, with more and more episodes centring around Carla, Norm, Cliff, and other characters.For a show that ran eleven years, Cheers had a surprisingly stable cast, with few of the original actors departing. It was following the third season that Nicholas Colasanto died due to his heart condition. Woody Harrelson was then introduced as Woody Boyd, the bartender who replaced Coach. Woody was a naive and none-too-bright Midwesterner. It was following the fifth season that Shelley Long left Cheers to pursue other projects. Diane was written out of the show as having left Boston. It was with the sixth season that the character of Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) was introduced. A corporation had bought Cheers from Sam and Rebecca was its new manager. Once Sam regained control of Cheers, Rebecca would remain, first as a waitress and then once more as its manager. It was during the third season that one major character would be introduced to the show. Originally psychiatrist Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) was a recurring character and a love interest for Diane. In the fourth season Diane dumped Frasier at the altar, after which he became a regular at Cheers. It was with the fifth season that Frasier became part of the main cast.As successful as Cheers was, it should be no surprise that the show would produce spin-offs. Nick Tortelli (Dan Hedaya) was Carla's ex-husband and a recurring character on Cheers early in its run. He had married again, this time to Loretta (Jean Kasem). They were eventually spun-off into their own show, The Tortellis. On The Tortellis, Nick and Loretta are now in Las Vegas. The Tortellis would not prove successful, running for only 13 episodes. After the cancellation of The Tortellis the characters would once more appear on Cheers.While The Tortellis failed, the second spin-off of Cheers, Frasier, was nearly as successful as the original show. Indeed, it also ran for eleven seasons. On Frasier, Frasier Crane had returned to his hometown of Seattle, where he became a local radio host. He moves in with his elderly father (John Mahoney), His younger brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) was also a psychiatrist. Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves) was Frasier's father Martin's live-in caretaker, with whom Niles was in love. Roz Doyle (Peri iGilpin) was the producer of Frasier's radio show. Except for Rebecca, every single remaining character from Cheers would appear on Frasier on one time or another. While Wings was not a spinoff of Cheers, the two shows seemed to exist in a shared universe. Wings was created by Cheers veterans  David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee. Cliff and Norm as well as Frasier and his wife Lilith appeared in episodes of Wings, while Rebecca had a cameo in yet another episode. St. Elsewhere also appears to exist in the same shared universe. In the St. Elsewhere episode \"Cheers,\" Westphall, Craig, and Auschlander visit Cheers, which is apparently only manned by Carla at the time. As might be expected, Norm and Cliff are there. After eleven seasons, Ted Danson decided it was time to move onto other things. Rather than continue the show without Sam, the production team then decided to bring the show to an end. Given Cheers had run eleven years and was still a high rated show, NBC then pulled out all the stops for the series finale. A whole night was dedicated to \"One for the Road,\" the final episode of the show. In addition to the episode itself, NBC aired a retrospective of the show. Following the episode the network aired an interview with the cast by Jay Leno. As might be expected, \"One for the Road\" was very successful in the Nielsen ratings, with  a 64 or 62 share. It is currently the third highest rated series finale after all time, after the M*A*S*H finale \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" and The Fugitive finale \"The Judgement Part 2.\" It remains the fourth highest episode of an American television, after the M*A*S*H, after the M*A*S*H finale, the Dallas episode \"Who Done It,\" and the Fugitive finale. As mentioned earlier, Cheers would go onto a highly successful run as a syndicated rerun and can still be found in syndication on local stations and cable channels. All eleven seasons have been released on DVD. The entire run of the show is also available on several streaming services.Throughout its run Cheers earned 111 Emmy nominations, with 28 wins. The success of Cheers can largely be chalked up to its characters. Its creators had set out to create a show about a group of co-workers who interact like a family. Ultimately, they created a show about a group of co-workers and their customers who interact as a family. Much like such shows as The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show before it, Cheers centred on a close-knit group of friends with who the average person could identify. In many ways the show was summed up by the title of its theme song, \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name.\" When it came to sitcoms, Cheers was also a bit of a pioneer. It was its third season that Cheers began using serialized storylines, with story arcs that would last through several episodes. It was also with that season that Cheers began using season finale cliffhangers. There had certainly been shows that had used serialized story lines before (The Beverly Hillbillies being one), but Cheers was still among the earliest. As to cliffhangers, very few sitcoms prior to Cheers had ever used them. If many of today's sitcoms are serialized today, it is largely because of the success of Cheers. Cheers was one of the most successful shows of the Eighties and ultimately one of the most successful shows of all time. It remains widely available, both in syndication and on streaming services. It is one of those very few shows that has maintained its popularity for forty years. It is safe to say it will still be popular in another forty."},
{"title": "Turner Classic Movies Remembers the Hollywood Blacklist This October", "date": "Thursday, September 29, 2022", "text": "It was not long after World War II that the period known as the Second Red Scare began in the United States. It was a time of widespread fear of the infiltration of American society by Communism and other leftist ideologies. It was only a matter of time before right-wing, anti-Communist ideologues turned their eyes towards Hollywood. It was on July 29 1946 that William R. Wilkerson, founder and publisher of The Hollywood Reporter, published a column naming several \"Communist sympathizers\" in the film industry (among them screenwriters Dalton Trumbo, Howard Koch, and Ring Lardner Jr.). It was in October 1947 that  the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed several figures from the film industry to testify at hearings regarding Communist infiltration of Hollywood. It was the beginning of the Hollywood Blacklist, a blacklist that denied employment to any actors, directors, writers, and other entertainment professionals perceived as being Communists, Communist sympathizers, or just too far to the left. Ultimately the Hollywood Blacklist, as well as the red baiting that occurred throughout the era, was not about punishing actual Communists. Legendary actress Marsha Hunt, who found herself blacklisted, said of the Blacklist, \"But then I was told, once I was blacklisted, you see, I was an articulate liberal, and that was bad. I was told that in fact it wasn’t really about communism — that was the thing that frightened everybody — it was about control and about power.\"This October Turner Classic Movies is observing the 75th anniversary of the Hollywood Blacklist the last three Wednesdays of October (October 13, October 20, and October 27).

{"title": "Viva Hollywood: The Legacy of Latin and Hispanic Artists in American Film by Luis I. Reyes", "date": "Wednesday, September 28, 2022", "text": "Both in front of the camera and behind the scenes, Latinos have been a part of the film industry from the beginning. Unfortunately, representation of Latinos in Hollywood has never been particularly good. Worse yet, often their contributions to the history of American film have gone unrecognized. Even today, representation of Latinos in film and television remains low. According to UCLA's Hollywood Diversity Report from 2021, Latinos only accounted for 7.1% of lead roles and 7,7% of all roles.Viva Hollywood: The Legacy of Latin and Hispanic Artists in American Film by Luis I. Reyes is a comprehensive history of the stars, artists, movies, achievements, and impact of the Latino and Hispanic communities in the history of American film. Luis I. Reyes may be familiar to many classic movie fans as the author of the 1995 book Hispanics in Hollywood and Made in Mexico: Hollywood South of the Border. He has also served as a unit publicist on such films as Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins (1985), American Me (1992), and My Family (1995) and the TV movies The Josephine Baker Story and The Cisco Kid. Viva Hollywood: The Legacy of Latin and Hispanic Artists in American Film includes a foreword by Jimmy Smits, who has starred in such films as Old Gringo (1989), My Family (1995), and three Stars Wars movies, as well as such TV shows as L.A. Law, NYPD Blue, and The West Wing. The focus of Viva Hollywood: The Legacy of Latin and Hispanic Artists in American Film is on the stars and artists behind the scenes who contributed to Hollywood history. It covers a span from the very beginnings of Hollywood cinema to the present day. As might be expected, it touches upon the major Latino and Hispanic stars in movie history, from such legends as Antonio Moreno and Gilbert Roland during the Silent Era, Lupe Vélez, Cesar Romero, Maria Montez, and Pedro Armendáriz from the Golden Age of Hollywood, and Rita Moreno, Raquel Welch, Raul Julia, and Andy Garcia from later eras. What sets Viva Hollywood: The Legacy of Latin and Hispanic Artists in American Film apart from other books is that Luis I. Reyes not only covers famous Latino and Hispanic actors, but also musicians, screenwriters, directors, and other artists. Mr. Reyes has extensive write ups on such legends as pianist José Iturbi, bandleader Xavier Cugat, and director Robert Ramirez. A whole chapter is dedicated to Latino and Hispanics' contributions to some of the greatest films ever made, including sculptor Marcel Delgado and matte painter Mario Larrinaga's contributions to King Kong (1933); Francisco \"Chico: Day's contributions as first assistant director to The Ten Commandments (1956); and choreographer Alex Romero's contributions to Jailhouse Rock (1957), among others. Viva Hollywood: The Legacy of Latin and Hispanic Artists in American Film mentions a large number of movies important in the history of Latinos in Hollywood, including the \"Mexican Spitfire\" series, Border Incident (1949), The Ring (1957), Zoot Suit (1981), and Stand and Deliver (1988).Luis L. Reyes recognizes that films are not made in a vacuum, and as a result he addresses some of the historic events that would have an impact on Latinos and Hispanics in film. He devotes a good deal of space to such history as World War II, the Zoot Suit Riots, the Good Neighbour policy, and  the Chicano Movement. Not only can the reader learn a good deal about the history of Latinos and Hispanics in film, but the over all history of Latinos in the United States since the advent of film.Viva Hollywood: The Legacy of Latin and Hispanic Artists in American Film also happens to be a very attractive book. It has a beautiful red dust jacket featuring Latino and Hispanic screen legends prominently. The interior of the book is also attractive, and features several photos throughout. Amanda Richmond designed both the book's cover and interior, and she is to be commended for a job well done. Viva Hollywood: The Legacy of Latin and Hispanic Artists in American Film is also very easy to read. Luis I. Reyes writes in a concise, yet readable style that allows him to pack a good deal of information in a relatively small space. What is more, he spares no details. Not only will those new to classic film and particularly those new to the history of Latinos and Hispanics in classic films learn some things, but so too will those of us who already know a good deal about Latino and Hispanic film history. Over the years Turner Classic Movies and Running Press have published many fine volumes on various aspects of film history, and Viva Hollywood: The Legacy of Latin and Hispanic Artists in American Film is one of their best. It is an in-depth, comprehensive, and loving look at the history of Latinos and Hispanics in classic American films. It will certainly be a welcome addition to any classic film buff's library."},

{"title": "The 60th Anniversary of The Beverly Hillbillies", "date": "Monday, September 26, 2022", "text": "The Beverly Hillbillies debuted sixty years ago today, on September 26 1962, on CBS. It proved to be a hit immediately after its debut and has remained popular ever since. After ending its run in 1971, The Beverly Hillbillies went onto a highly successful run in syndication. Over the years it has aired on such cable channels as TBS, Nick at Nite, TV Land, WGN, and The Hallmark Channel. It can still be seen on such outlets MeTV, Circle, Classic Reruns TV, GAC Family, and ZLiving. While most people probably realize that The Beverly Hillbillies has always been a popular show, what many may not realize that it is also one of the most successful TV shows of all time.The Beverly Hillbillies centred on a hillbilly family who moved from the Ozarks to Beverly Hills after their patriarch, Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen), found oil on his land. Although collectively known as \"the Clampetts,\" they were not a traditional nuclear family as usually seen on television at the time. In fact, aside from Jed himself, only his daughter Elly May (Donna Douglas) shared the last name \"Clampett.\" Elly May was a tomboy skilled in hunting, climbing trees, and even wrestling, who loved animals. Moving to Beverly Hills with Jed and Elly May was Jed's mother in law, Granny. Granny's full-name was Daisy Moses and while the rest of the family appear to have come from the Ozarks, Granny came from Tennessee. Granny brewed moonshine, which she claimed was for medicinal purposes, and took great pride in being an M.D. (\"Mountain Doctor\").  Since Jed, Elly May, and Granny couldn't drive, it was Elly May's cousin Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.) who drove them to Beverly Hills in an ancient truck. Jethro was not very bright, but fancied himself as being intelligent (he was proud of his \"sixth grade education\"). Pearl Bodine (Bea Benaderat), was Jethro's mother and Jed's cousin, who often came into conflict with Granny. Jed kept his money in the Commerce Bank of Beverly Bills, of which Milburn Drysdale (Raymond Bailey) was president. Mr. Drydsale was consumed by his love of money, and would do nearly anything to keep the Clampetts' money in his bank. He even moved the Clampetts next door to him, something that did not sit well with is blueblood wife, Margaret Drysdale (Harriet McGibbon). Mr. Drysdale's secretary, Jane Hathaway (Nancy Kulp) acted as a voice of reason to Mr. Drysdale.  She frequently questioned her boss's schemes and sometimes even defied him if she thought he had gone too far. Even though she was educated at Vassar, Miss Jane (as the Clampetts called her) treated the Clampetts as equals and friends.The Beverly Hillbillies was the creation of Paul Henning, who was a seasoned veteran of writing situation comedies at the time. He got his start in radio with a script for Fibber McGee and Molly and wound up spending 15 years with the show. He went on to work with The Burns and Allen Show on radio and made the transition with the show when it moved to television. He created The Bob Cummings Show (also known as Love That Bob), which ran for five season and saw success as a syndicated rerun.Paul Henning not only had considerable experience with sitcoms when he created The Beverly Hillbillies, but he also has some experience with actual mountain folk. He was born and raised in Independence, Missouri. As a Boy Scout he would go on camping trips to the Ozarks where he encountered real life hillbillies. Not only had he met mountain folk in real life, but he also had some experience in writing rural humour. While at the radio station KMBC in Kansas City early in his career, he was both a writer and cast member on Happy Hollow, a show described as \"a down-home program featuring traditional music, country humour, and the corn-fed wisdom of 'Uncle Ezra'.\" With Stanley Shapiro on both The RCA Victor Show and The Dennis Day Show, he created the character of Charley Weaver, a rural character that performer Cliff Arquette adopted for his own. He also wrote two episodes of The Real McCoys, the show that would spark the upsurge in rural comedies during the Sixties.It was in the early Sixties that Al Simon, an executive at Filmways, approached Paul Henning about writing a pilot for them. Paul Henning drew upon his experiences with hillfolk and his love of rural humour to create what was initially titled The Hillbillies of Beverly Hills. The title was soon changed to The Beverly Hillbillies, which created some problems for the producers. Country musician Zeke Manners had a band called The Beverly Hill Billies in the Thirties that proved to be somewhat popular on radio at the time. Fortunately, the producers and Zeke Manners were able to work out a deal so that the TV show would keep its title The Beverly Hillbillies.The Beverly Hillbillies was pitched to ABC, the home of earlier hillbilly hit The Real McCoys. ABC turned the show down. Ultimately, CBS picked the show up. Unfortunately, they scheduled it against the popular show Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall on NBC. To make matters worse, CBS gave the new show absolutely no promotion. Filmways then mounted their own promotional campaign.  Filmways produced a series of 20 to 60 second spots that started airing in 85 cities six weeks prior to the debut of the show.As it turned out, The Beverly Hillbillies proved to be the smash hit of the 1962-1963 season. It debuted to a 28 ratings share, and its ratings simply improved from there.  By only its fourth week on the air, The Beverly Hillbillies became the no. 1 show on network television, with a phenomenal 33.7 ratings share. In the end it became the the first show in the history of television to be no. 1 for the year during its very first season (here I must point out that The $64000 Question was a summer replacement before becoming the no. 1 show for the 1955-1956 season). The Beverly Hillbillies would remain the no. 1 show on the air in its second season. Indeed, if anything, it became even more successful, actually breaking records in the ratings with several episodes. To this day the January 8 1964 episode \"The Giant Jackrabbit\" remains the highest rated, half hour episode of a sitcom. What is more, seven other episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies aired in late 1963 and early 1964 remain among the most watched programmes on American television for all time. The Beverly Hillbillies would not maintain such incredibly high ratings for the entirety of its run, but it still did respectably well. Ultimately it spent five of its seasons in the top ten highest rated shows and three in the top twenty. It was only in its final season that it failed to reach the top thirty.While The Beverly Hillbillies debuted to phenomenal ratings, it also received some of the worst reviews for any show in the history of American television. Rick Du Brow of UPI wrote about the show, \"The series aimed low and hit its target.\"  William K. Sarmento in The Lowell Sun commented that, \"...last night’s premiere of The Beverly Hillbillies was an insult to the intelligence of the most moronic viewer,\" and remarked, \"The show is a cross between The Real McCoys and L’il Abner.\" William K. Sarmento wasn't the only critic to bring up The Real McCoys in a review of The Beverly Hillbillies. Variety wrote the show off as an imitation of The Real McCoys and further wrote that it was \"...painful to sit through\" and \"...improbable and impossible as the characters who people it.\"  No less than The New York Times called the show \"...strained and unfunny.\"Although it might have seemed so at the time, not every review of The Beverly Hillbillies was negative. Cynthia Lowry of Associated Press actually liked the show and wrote, \"...it promises to be uninhibited and amusing if the writers remember to add enough branch water to the corn.\" One individual with much more intellectual clout than any television critic also genuinely liked the show. Cultural critic and writer Gilbert Seldes wrote essays on the show for both the December 15 1962 issue of TV Guide and January 5 1963 issues of The Saturday Review. He pointed out that while  the typical formula for comedy was \"real people in unreal situations\", the formula for comedy on The Beverly Hillbillies was \"unreal people in unreal situations.\"For a show that ran nine seasons, The Beverly Hillbillies saw very little change in its cast over the years. The core characters of Jed, Granny, Elly Mae, Jethro, Mr. Drysdale, and Jane Hathaway all remained with the show for the entirety of its run. The second season of the show would see one major change in its cast. During its first season Jed's cousin Pearl Bodine was a recurring character on The Beverly Hillbillies. The Beverly Hillbillies producer and creator Paul Henning had known Bea Benaderet since their days on radio working on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show (on which she played George and Gracie's neighbour Blanche Morton). He had long admired her as a comedic talent and thought that after years of playing supporting roles it was time for her to be a lead in a situation comedy. He then created the sitcom Petticoat Junction as a vehicle for Bea Benaderet. After last appearing in the first season episode, \"The Psychiatrist Gets Clampetted,\" Pearl made one last appearance on the show in the sixth season episode \"Greetings from the President\" in 1967.While the central cast of The Beverly Hillbillies would remain intact for its whole run, various recurring characters would come and go. John Brewster (Frank Wilcox), the executive of O.K. Oil Company (the company that bought the rights to the oil on Jed's land ) was a recurring character for the show's first five seasons. Elverna Bradshaw (Elvia Allman), Granny's rival from the hills, was a recurring character on the show from its first season to its eighth season. John Cushing (Roy Roberts), the president of the Commerce Bank's rival Merchants Bank, who was always trying to lure the Clampetts away to his institution, appeared on the show as a recurring character from its third to its sixth season. Dash Riprock, a handsome actor who started out as one of Elly May's suitors and became friends with the Clampetts, appeared from the show's third season to its seventh season. Dr. Roy Clyburn (Fred Clark) was Mr. Drysdale's doctor who was always trying to keep Granny from practising her mountain medicine. He was a recurring character from the show's second season to its fifth season. Late in the show's run famed character actor Percy Helton played Homer Cratchit, a bank clerk at Commerce Bank who had worked under Mr. Drysdale's father. Daneille Mardi played the recurring role of British Commerce Bank secretary Helen Thompson.It would be another actress who played a secretary at Commerce Bank who might well be the most famous person to have a recurring role on The Beverly Hillbillies. Sharon Tate had been signed to a seven year contract with Filmways by its president Martin Rashonoff in 1963. Considered for the role of Billie Jo Bradley on Petticoat Junction, Mr. Rashonoff thought she needed more confidence and cast her in a guest appearance on the Filmways show Mister Ed and then in the role of secretary Janet Trego on The Beverly Hillbillies. Sharon Tate first appeared on The Beverly Hillbillies in the show's second season, playing a student named Mary at a school Elly May was attending. She first appeared as Janet Trego in the second season episode \"Jethro's First Love.\" She continued to appear as Janet Trego until the show's fourth season. By that point her movie career was beginning and she no longer appeared on the show. It is to be noted that the naturally blonde Sharon Tate played Janet in a brunette wig.One of the most unusual recurring characters to appear on The Beverly Hillbillies was Jethro's twin sister Jethrine. Jethrine was played by Max Baer Jr. in drag. While many people probably assume Max Baer Jr. played Jethrine using a falsetto voice, in reality her voice was provided by Paul Henning's daughter Linda Kaye. Linda Kaye later played Betty Jo Bradley on Petticoat Junction. Jethrine appeared in several episodes of the first season and made her last appearance in the second season episode \"Christmas with the Clampetts.\"There were many more recurring characters on The Beverly Hillbillies than I have listed here. Some would appear for several seasons, others for only one story arc. Of course, this was one of the ways in which The Beverly Hillbillies differed from other sitcoms of its day or sitcoms before it. Other sitcoms of the Sixties were episodic, with their plots neatly wrapped up  in one episode. The Beverly Hillbillies featured story arcs that would unfold over multiple episodes. Among the story arcs on The Beverly Hillbillies were the Clampetts inheriting a castle in England; Jethro playing Robin Hood in Griffith Park and leading a band of hippies as his \"Merry Men;\" Jethro opening his own talent agency on the fifth floor of the Commerce Bank building; and yet others. The Beverly Hillbillies was hardly serialized the way modern TV shows are, but it did utilize plots that would unfold over several episodes. This made it a pioneer in television, particularly with regards to sitcoms. Another way in which The Beverly Hillbillies differed from earlier sitcoms is that on many of the domestic comedies episodes would revolve around a crisis that were neatly resolved in a half hour, often with some sort of moral to the story. On The Beverly Hillbillies often various crises would not be resolved at the end of an episode, and there was generally no moral to the story. Quite simply, on The Beverly Hillbillies the emphasis was on comedy, with no real concern to resolving the personal problems of the characters in any given episode. As Gilbert Seldes pointed out, the formula for comedy on The Beverly Hillbillies was \"unreal people in unreal situations.\"One more way that The Beverly Hillbillies differed from many sitcoms is that it existed in a shared universe with Petticoat Junction and Green Acres. While the Warner Bros. Westerns and detective shows of the late Fifties and early Sixties existed in a shared universe, this was something that had not been seen in sitcoms before. Hooterville, the small town that served as the setting for both Petticoat Junction and Green Acres, was first referenced in in the sixth episode of The Beverly Hillbillies, \"Trick or Treat.\" It was during the show's seventh season that the Clampetts, as well as Mr. Drysdale and Miss Jane, actually visited Hooterville, spending both Thanksgiving and Christmas there. Afterwards Frank Cady would make a few guest appearances as Sam Drucker from Petitcoat Junction and Green Acres on The Beverly Hillbillies.  \"The Clampett-Hewes Empire\", that aired in the 1970-1971 season, would be the last crossover episode between The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres. Of course, since then there have been other sitcoms that have existed in shared universes (Cheers Wings, The Tortellis, and Frasier being an example).For the most part The Beverly Hillbillies concentrated on its central cast and recurring characters rather than frequently featuring guest stars, although over the years several big names appeared on the show. Blue grass legends Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs would guest star as themselves in a few episodes. The two of them had written the show's theme song, \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett.\" Their fictional wives on the show were played by Joi Lansing (who played Lester Flatt's wife) and Midge Ware (who played Earl Scrugg's wife). Perhaps the biggest name to appear on the show was John Wayne, who had a cameo in the fifth season episode \"The Indians Are Coming.\" Gloria Swanson was another big name to appear on The Beverly Hillbillies, playing herself in the fifth season episode \"The Gloria Swanson Story.\"  Julie Newmar guest starred in the fourth season episode \"The Beautiful Maid,\" playing an actress Mr. Drysdale installed as a maid in the Clampett household so she can learn their backwoods dialect for a role (the episode aired on March 30 1966, only two weeks after she had made her debut as Catwoman on Batman). Ted Cassidy guest starred on the fifth season episode \"The Dahlia Feud\" as Mr. Ted, Mrs. Drysdale's nearly invulnerable gardener (even Granny's shotgun didn't phase him). Phil Silvers played shifty conman \"Honest John\" in the eighth season episodes \"Jed Buys Central Park\" and \"The Clampetts in New York.\" Among other things, he \"sold\" Jed Central Park. It was in the following episode that what might have been the biggest name besides John Wayne appeared. In \"Manhattan Hillbillies\" Sammy Davis Jr. played a New York City police officer. Sammy Davis Jr. was friends with Dick Wesson, who wrote several episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies from its first season to its last.Another famous face appeared in the pilot of The Beverly Hillbillies. Robert Osborne, the film historian who worked for The Hollywood Reporter and gained everlasting fame as the first host of Turner Classic Movies, had at one time been an actor. In the pilot for The Beverly Hillbillies Robert Osborne played Mr. Drysdale's young assistant, Jeff Taylor. He was offered a regular role on the show, but turned it down thinking that the pilot would never sell. As might be expected of a show that became a smash it nearly upon its debut, there was some Beverly Hillbillies merchandise on the shelves in the Sixties. Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs released \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\" as a single and it went to no. 1 on the Billboard Country chart and no. 44 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1963 a soundtrack album for the TV series was released, with the cast performing in character. In 1966 Irene Ryan released a single as Granny entitled \"Granny's Mini-skirt.\" Standard Toycraft put out a Beverly Hillbillies board game, while Milton Bradley put out a Beverly Hillbillies card game. Aladdin manufactured a Beverly Hillbillies lunchbox with a Thermos. In 1963 Ben Cooper released Halloween costumes based on The Beverly Hillbillies Later, in the late Sixties and early Seventies, Halco would put out their own Halloween costumes based on the show. Dell Comics published several issues of a Beverly Hillbillies comic book from 1963 to 1971. As mentioned earlier, The Beverly Hillbillies did very well in the ratings. It ranked no. 1 for the year in its first two seasons, and spent five years in the top ten and another three in the top twenty. It was only with its ninth and final season that it failed to make the top thirty of the Nielsen ratings for the year. Much of the reason the show might have fallen in the ratings may have been the fact that CBS moved it from its long time Wednesday time slot to a new time slot on Tuesday. There it faced strong competition from The Mod Squad. While the ratings for The Beverly Hillbillies had dropped, they were still high enough that any other season it might have been renewed. Unfortunately, the 1970-1971 season was the year of the Rural Purge.As early as 1967 CBS was concerned about its ageing and largely rural audience. At the time it was reported that CBS wanted to redo its schedule to better compete with NBC for the younger, 18-49 year old demographic desired by Madison Avenue. It was in 1969 that Robert D. Wood became president of CBS. He was concerned with both the network's falling ratings (although it was still no. 1 each season) and concerned that it was not attracting younger viewers. It was in June 1970 he appointed Fred Silverman as Vice President, Programs, essentially the head of CBS's programming department. It would be Fred Silverman who hit upon improving the network's fortunes by cancelling nearly every single show that appealed to an older, rural audience at once.Of course, much of the impetus for the Rural Purge was not simply making CBS better able to compete with NBC for younger viewers, but also the fact that the Prime Time Access Rule was going into effect at the start of the 1971-1972 season. The Prime Time Access Rule cut several hours from the networks' prime time schedules each week. The FCC had enacted the Prime Time Access Rule out of concerns over the amount of control the networks exerted over the production and distribution of television shows. The FCC hoped that the rule would create more diverse programming on local stations by letting them air different sorts of shows in time slots that once belonged the networks. Regardless, because of the Prime Time Access Rule, the networks had to cancel many more TV shows than they ever had before. In the case of CBS, the network used it as a chance to get rid of shows that appealed to rural audiences and older audiences in hopes of attracting younger viewers.It was with its ninth season that The Beverly Hillbillies was cancelled, although it might well have been renewed any other season. Green Acres, Mayberry R.F.D., and the variety show Hee Haw were also cancelled. The latter two shows ranked in the top twenty for the year, making them among the highest rated shows ever cancelled. The Beverly Hillbillies had been the smash hit of the 1962-1963 season. It ended its run cancelled en masse with several other shows.The Beverly Hillbillies was gone, but hardly forgotten. From  the late Seventies into the Eighties, TV reunion movies were popular on American broadcast television. With the continued popularity of The Beverly Hillbillies it was perhaps inevitable that there would be a TV reunion movie. That TV movie, Return of The Beverly Hillbillies, aired on October 6 1981. Irene Ryan had died in 1973 and Raymond Bailey in 1980, so Granny and Mr. Drysdale were noticeably absent from the reunion movie. Max Baer Jr., who had been typecast as Jethro, did not want to return for the reunion movie and so Ray Young played the role. While The Beverly Hillbillies had become much more highly regarded than it had upon its debut, Return of the Beverly Hillbillies received bad reviews from critics and received mediocre ratings. Even fans were not too happy with the TV reunion movie. In 1993 CBS aired a retrospective of The Beverly Hillbillies, The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies. Buddy Epsen, Donna Douglas, and Max Baer Jr. reunited for the special. The special proved successful, ranking fourth in the Nielsen ratings for the week. Interestingly enough, The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies treated the 1981 TV reunion movie as if it has never happened.That same year a feature film based on the TV show was released. The Beverly Hillbillies (1993) starred Jim Varney as Jed, Cloris Leachman as Granny, Erika Eliniak as Elly Mae, Dabney Coleman as Mr. Drysdale, and Lily Tomlin as Jane Hathway. The movie was released to abysmal reviews. It also did poorly at the box office. Perhaps audiences did not appreciate a beloved sitcom being resurrected as a film with 1990s humour, some of which could be considered offensive (it is inconceivable that the Clampetts, or any real residents of the Ozarks, would eat \"roadkill stew\"). Today The Beverly Hillbillies can still be seen on various television outlets and is available on streaming services. The show that many critics in 1962 thought was insulting to the intelligence of audiences is now regarded as a classic. Quite simply, many critics in 1962 did not seem to grasp that The Beverly Hillbillies was different from anything before it. As mentioned earlier, it threw the standard, domestic comedy format of episodes whereby crises would be neatly resolved in a half hour out the window. Not only were situations in many episodes left unresolved at the end, but the comedy in The Beverly Hillbillies was often so broad that it could be considered absurdist. The show certainly had no pretence towards realism.Beyond the fact that the comedy of The Beverly Hillbillies was extremely broad, it also differed from its contemporaries (not to mention earlier sitcoms) in that it acted as a social satire. The honest, hard working Clampetts were often contrasted with the often hypocritical city folk of Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. While the show served as an attack on the upper class of Beverly Hills, it also acknowledged the changes in society throughout the Sixties. Over its seasons it spoofed Hollywood, beatniks, dance crazes, the spy craze, the counterculture (to which it was somewhat sympathetic), the student movement, feminism, environmentalism, jogging, and the growing interest in Eastern religions. While The Beverly Hillbillies never addressed the Vietnam War or the anti-war movement, it did acknowledge that the world around the Clampetts was changing, which was more than many of the sitcoms of the era did.The Beverly Hillbillies' influence would be seen in future \"fish out of the water\" comedies, including sister show Green Acres, Newhart, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, The Nanny, and The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Derided by critics upon its debut, it became phenomenally successful with episodes still ranking among the most watched of all time. While it never reached those heights of success ever since, it remains popular to this day and still maintains a large and faithful following."},

{"title": "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1967)", "date": "Friday, September 23, 2022", "text": "This post is part of the Fifth Broadway Bound Blogathon Hosted by Taking Up Room)In the Sixties, as is still the case now, Broadway musicals were often adapted as films. As to the Broadway musicals themselves, they might spring from original concept (such as Stop the World I Want to Get Off), based on earlier play or plays (A Funny Thing Happened on the Forum, based on Plautus's  Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus, and Mostellaria), or a book (Oliver!, based on Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist). One would not expect to see a Broadway musical based on a parody of self-help books. Even so, that is exactly the case with How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.The musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying  was based on the book How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying: The Dastard's Guide to Fame and Fortune by Shepherd Mead, published in 1952. It is a satire of self-help books, popular then as now. In the case of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying: The Dastard's Guide to Fame and Fortune, it satirizes office work of the sort done for large companies by dishing out often outrageous advice on how to get ahead at work. To some degree How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying: The Dastard's Guide to Fame and Fortune owes something to The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship: Or the Art of Winning Games Without Actually Cheating by Stephen Potter, a parody of self-help books which sought to advise the reader on how to win games. Stephen Potter would write further self-help book parodies, including Lifemanship: With a Summary of Recent Researches in Gamesmanship (1950) One-Upmanship: Being Some Account of the Activities and Teachings of the Lifemanship Correspondence College of One-Upness and Games Lifemastery (1954), and Christmas-ship; or, The Art of Giving and Receiving (1956). Although it was a parody, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying: The Dastard's Guide to Fame and Fortune did have some basis in reality. It was based on Stephen Mead's career at the advertising agency Benton & Bowles. He joined the agency in 1936, working in the mail room, and eventually became a vice president. It was while he was working at Benton & Bowles that he wrote the book in his spare time.  How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying: The Dastard's Guide to Fame and Fortune proved to be a best seller. It attracted the attention of Willie Gilbert and Jack Weinstock, who wrote a play based on the work in 1955 that went unproduced for five years. It was talent agent Abe Newborn who came up with the idea of adapting the book as a musical. To this end, he brought his idea to producers  Cy Feuer and Ernest H. Martin, who had been responsible for Guys and Dolls. Abe Burrows worked on the musical's book with Willie Gilbert and Jack Weinstock. The legendary Frank Loesser, who had written \"Once in Love with Amy\" for Where's Charley? and several of the songs for Guys and Dolls, wrote the lyrics and music for How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Willie Gilbert was the director, while Bob Fosse was responsible for the choreography, with the choreography in \"Treasure Hunt\" sequence having been created by an obscure choreographer named Hugh Lambert.How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying opened on October 14 1961 at the 46th Street Theatre. It proved to be highly successful. It opened to largely positive reviews and won eight Tony Awards (it was nominated for nine). It ultimately ran for 1417 performances, finally closing on March 6 1965. As the original book How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying: The Dastard's Guide to Fame and Fortune was a parody of self-help books, it has neither plot nor characters. When Willie Gilbert and Jack Weinstock wrote their original play and then when they turned it into a musical with Abe Burrows, they had to provide it with both a plot and characters. To do so, they used author Shepherd Mead's career as inspiration. The plot centres on J. Pierrepont Finch, a young window washer who picks up the book How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Using the book as a guide, he then gets a job in the mail room of the World Wide Wicket Company and then proceeds to use the book to work his way up the corporate ladder. Given the success of the Broadway musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, it should come as no surprise that it would be adapted as a movie. United Artists paid $1 million dollars for the film rights to the musical. For the most part the movie version use the cast of the Broadway play. Robert Morse (J. Pierrepont Finch) Rudy Vallee (World Wide Wicket Company president J. B. Bigley), and Ruth Kobart (Mr. Bigley's secretary Miss Jones) all reprised their roles from the Broadway production. Michele Lee had replaced Bonnie Scott on Broadway as Finch's love interest, the secretary Rosemary Pilkington, and played the role in the film. Maureen Arthur replaced Virginia Martin as Mr. Bigley's mistress Hedy LaRue on Broadway, and played the role in the movie. Some changes were made from the Broadway musical for the movie. In the original Broadway musical, J. Pierrepont Finch is a much edgier character, and so the character was softened a bit. The songs Love From a Heart of Gold,\" \"Happy to Keep His Dinner Warm,\" and \"Cinderella Darling.\" were all cut for the film. A portion of the song \"Coffee Break\" was included in the movie. As it appears on the movie's soundtrack album, some think the song may have been filmed, but the scene scrapped for whatever reason. In the case of \"Paris Original,\" its music is simply heard in the background.How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1967) was released on March 9 1967 to largely positive reviews. Unfortunately, it failed at the box office. It made its television debut on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies on November 25 1972. It would be through repeated showings on television that it would develop a following. It was released on DVD in 2003 and is available on various streaming services.Even today How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1967) holds up well. Quite simply, the comedy in the movie is so good that it would work well even without the songs and musical sequences. Indeed, while most of the comedy in the film is centred on work in an office, it also takes shots at such things as college sports rivalries. And while many of the situations in the film are exaggerated for humorous effect, anyone who has worked in an office, particularly one for a large corporation, will recognize many of them as true to working in an office. The characters are also enjoyable. Even when J. Pierrepont Finch is at his most devious, one can't help but root for him.One can see echoes of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying in such workplace comedies as The Secret To my Success (1987) and Working Girl (1988) . And while How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying is a comedy with somewhat exaggerated situations, it may well have had an influence on the TV drama Mad Men. Indeed on Mad Men Robert Morse (J. Pierrepont Finch himself) played Bert Cooper, the senior partner of the advertising agency Sterling Cooper. Bert would recommend the works of Ayn Rand to others from time to time. One had to wonder if he didn't recommend the book How to Succeed in Business by Shepherd Mead as well...."},

{"title": "The 60th Anniversary of the TV Series The Virginian", "date": "Tuesday, September 20, 2022", "text": "Today ninety minute television shows are unknown on American broadcast network television. Long ago the networks appear to have settled on a half hour with commercials for comedies and an hour with commercials for dramas as acceptable lengths for TV shows. That having been said, there was a time when shows that were ninety minutes in length were not unknown on American broadcast network television. The successful anthology show Playhouse 90, debuting in 1956, was ninety minutes in length. In the Seventies, NBC Mystery Movie was ninety minutes and later even two hours in length. In between those two shows was The Virginian. The Virginian was not only the first ninety minute Western, but one of the most successful ninety minute shows ever. It ran for nine seasons and spent eight of those seasons in the top thirty highest rated shows for each year. It debuted on September 19 1962, making yesterday its 60th anniversary.The TV series was loosely based on the novel The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains by Owen Wistler. The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains was set on the Sunk Creek Ranch outside Medicine Bow,Wyoming in the 1890s. It centred on the title character, who is only known as the Virginian. Starting out as a cowboy, the Virginian eventually became the foreman of the Sunk Creek Ranch. Among other things, the Virginian comes into conflict with Trampas, a cowboy and gambler. The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains is counted as one of the earliest Western novels and it would have a lasting influence on the genre. What we today consider Western cliches originated with The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains. The line \"Smile, when you say that\" stems from a line in the novel, \"When you call me that, smile!\" The trope of the mysterious stranger who wanders into town or onto a ranch originated with the Virginian, a man with no name if there ever was one. It was in The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains that a schoolmarm first appears as the hero's love interest. It even features the first classic \"showdown\" in the history of Western fiction.Given the impact of The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains, it should come as no surprise that it has been adapted to film and television multiple times. It was twice adapted as a movie during the Silent Era, first in 1914 and then in 1923. It would be adapted again as a talkie in 1929 with Gary Cooper in the title role, establishing him as a Western star. It was adapted again in 1946 with Joel McCrea as the Virginian. Indeed, as early as the late Fifties there was a proposed TV show based on The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains. Television writer Frank Price then an analyst and story editor at Screen Gems, suggested The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains as the basis for a possible TV series. He realized that the novel had gone into public domain, so Screen Gems would have to pay nothing for it. A half hour pilot was then shot, written by Leslie Stevens, who would go onto create The Outer Limits. In the title role it starred a young actor James Drury, who would play the Virginian in 1962 series. Despite the fact that James Drury played the role, in many ways the Virginian of the pilot was very different from the Virginian of the 1962 series. In the pilot the character was a bit of a fop, dressed in a frilly shirt with lace cuffs. NBC did not pick up the pilot, but but it for this proposed series based on The Virginian; Horseman of the Plains was shown on the anthology series Decision on July 6 1958.The origins of the 1962 series The Virginian can be traced back to Jennings Lang, vice president of MCA TV Limited. As vice president, he was involved in the development and sale of television shows and worked with MCA's production company Revue Productions. In the early Sixties not only was Wagon Train Revue's most successful show, but for the 1960-1961 season it was the no. 2 show on the air. For the 1961-1962 show it was the number 1 show on the air. With NBC about to renew Wagon Train, Jennings Lang figured he could make twice as much money by selling it to another network. While perpetually third rated network ABC had seen some success with such Warner Bros. shows as Maverick and 77 Sunset Strip, the network's fortunes were in decline by the early Sixties and they desperately needed a hit series. Jennings Lang then sold Wagon Train to ABC.NBC's executives were hardly happy and wanted something to replace Wagon Train. Jennings Lang then proposed television's first ninety minute Western, The Virginian to NBC. To write the show's format, Jennings Lang assigned Frank Price, who had written Screen Gems' failed pilot for The Virginian. Frank Price would serve as an executive producer on the series. Charles Marquis Warren, who had produced both Gunsmoke and Rawhide, served as a producer early in the history of The Virginian and largely shaped the series. He left after only 10 episodes. He was followed for a time by Roy Huggins, who had produced Maverick.Several actors were considered for the role of the Virginian (Frank Price thought Steve Forrest was among them), but the role ultimately went to the actor who had portrayed the Virginian in the Screen Gems pilot, James Drury. The character of Trampas on the television series would be completely different from the character in the original novel. In the series Trampas was a fun-loving, easy going cowboy who was friends with the Virginian. Doug McClure was the only actor considered for the role, having impressed MCA with his performance was one of the leads in the short-lived show Overland Trail. Beyond a complete change in Trampas's personality, the TV series would differ from the novel in other ways. In the novel the ranch was named the Sunk Creek Ranch and its owner was Judge Henry. It was renamed Shiloh Ranch for the show. Cast in the role of the Judge, Lee J. Cobb wanted to change the character's name, so he became Judge Henry Garth. Another difference from the novel was that in the TV series Judge Garth is given a young daughter, Betsy, played by Roberta Shore. The character of Steven Hill, played by Gary Clarke, was based on the character of Steve from the original novel. As in the novel, he was a friend of the Virginian. While The Virginian was a ninety minute show, NBC still expected the producers to deliver one episode a week. For this reason it had a more gruelling schedule than other shows. Each episode took eight days to shoot and they were often shooting multiple episodes at once. Of the schedule, star James Drury commented to True West on the occasion of the show's fiftieth anniversary, “A logistical nightmare, with as many as four shows shooting at the same time. But we got it done.\" Many of the cast wore the same clothing much of the time, That way any footage could be used again in other episodes.Over time The Virginian would see several changes in its cast. Among the first changes in its cast was the departure of Gary Clarke, who played Steven Hill. The character of Steve was simply phased out during the second season, with no real explanation ever given by the producers or NBC. It was during the second season that the character of young ranch hand Randy Benton was introduced. Played by Randy Boone, he remained with the show until its fourth season. It was in the third season that the character of Deputy Sheriff Emmett Ryker was introduced. He was played by Clu Gulager. By season four, Deputy Ryker would become the sheriff. With a brief interruption during season five, Clu Gulager remained with The Virginian until its sixth season.The biggest changes in the cast of The Virginian up until that time would occur with the fourth season. It was during the fourth season that Roberta Shore left the show. Betsy was written out of the show when she married a former minister and moved with him to Pennsylvania. To a degree this reflected Roberta Shore's real life, as she left the show to focus on her marriage. The role of the ingenue on the show was then filled by Diane Roter as the Judge's niece Jennifer Sommers. She remained with the show until its the end of its fourth season.  It was also with the end of the fourth season that Lee J. Cobb left The Virginian. Mr. Cobb was none too happy with the show and as a result he left The Virginian.The character of Judge Garth would be replaced by a new character named Morgan Starr. played by John Dehner. Judge Garth had been appointed Governor of Wyoming, and so the Judge hired Morgan Starr to run the ranch. Unfortunately, the character of Morgan Starr was not well received and John Dehner did not remain on the show long. He was replaced by Charles Bickford as John Grainger at the start of the fifth season. John Grainger had two grandchildren, Stacey Granger played by John Quine and Elizabeth Granger played by Sara Lane. Unfortunately, John Bickford died from pneumonia and a blood infection at the age 76 on November 9 1967. After Charles Bickford had died, both Don Quine and Sara Lane remained with the show for a time. Don Quine left with season six, while Sara Lane remained with the show until its eighth season. Their grandfather, John Grainger, would be replaced by his brother, Clay Grainger, played by John McIntire. Clay Grainger had a wife, Holly, played by John McIntire's real life wife Jeanette Nolan. The two characters would remain with the show until the end of its eighth season. It was with the eighth season that The Virginian would undergo dramatic changes.It was with the eighth season that The Virginian did not rank in the to 25 for the first time in its history. It didn't even rank in the top thirty. It was perhaps for this reason that The Virginian was entirely retooled and even given a new title, Men From Shiloh. This was the result of a joint decision of Sid Sheinberg, then head of Universal TV, and Herb Schlosser, head of NBC programming. To a large degree, the retooled show, now titled The Men From Shiloh, would be patterned after Universal's successful series The Name of the Game. Like The Virginian, The Name of the Game was ninety minutes in length. Like The Virginian, The Name of the Game aired on NBC. Unlike The Virginian, The Name of the Game was a drama that rotated among three leads. One week viewers might tune into see Tony Franciosa as crusading reporter Jeff Dillon, then the next week they might see Gene Barry as publisher Glenn Howard, and then again the following week they might see Robert Stack as crime reporter Dan Farrell. The Men From Shiloh utilized the same format of rotating leads as The Name of the Game. Clay and Holly Grainger were replaced by a new owner of the Shiloh Ranch, Colonel Alan MacKenzie (Stewart Granger).  Colonel MacKenzie was a retired British Army officer who even had his own valet (Parker, played by John McLiam). Another new character was cowboy Roy Tate, played by Lee Major (fresh from his run on the Western The Big Valley). These two characters would rotate as leads along with James Drury as the Virginian and Doug McClure. One major difference in the cast of The Men From Shiloh with earlier casts of The Virginian is that there were no girls or women among the leads whatsoever.The title and the format were not the only things that were changed. A new title sequence, not unlike those used on The Name of the Game, was created by Jack Cole, who had also provided the title sequences for Ironside and The Name of the Game. Percy Faith's original theme for The Virginian was replaced by a new theme composed by Ennio Morricone, who had composed the scores for A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966). Even the costumes of the Virginian and Trampas were changed. After eight seasons of wearing essentially the same thing, the two characters were given all new wardrobes. Even production of the show would change, with different executive producers handling different characters. Col. MacKenzie and Tate were handled by Herbert Hirschman and Edward J. Montagne. Leslie Stevens and Glen Larson handled the episodes featuring Trampas, while Norman MacDonnell took care of the episodes featuring the Virginian. If the name \"Norman MacDonnell\" sounds familiar, it is because he co-created the radio show Gunsmoke. The Men From Shiloh improved in the ratings from the eighth season of The Virginian. In fact, it did very well, ranking at no. 18 for the year. Unfortunately, the 1970-1971 season was the last season before the Prime Time Access Rule took effect. The Prime Time Access Rule was a regulation created by the FCC, who were concerned about the dominance of the broadcast networks in television programming and production. Among other things, it cut several hours in prime time each week from the network schedules. The networks then had to cancel many more shows than they ever had before. It was with the 1970-1971 season that NBC's archrival, CBS, performed what was soon known as the Rural Purge, cancelling every single show that appealed to an audience that was too rural or older. Quite simply, CBS wanted to attract the younger 18-49 demographic desired by Madison Avenue.CBS was not alone in cancelling show that whose audiences were either too rural or too old. Both ABC and NBC cancelled shows that did not appeal to the 18-14 demographic as well. The Men From Shiloh was among the shows that NBC cancelled because its audience was too old. Having come in at no. 18 for the year, it was among the highest rated shows ever cancelled.The Virginian had a lasting influence. It proved that a ninety minute show could be successful. It was because of the success of The Virginian that during the 1963-1964 season Wagon Train was expanded to ninety minutes and also made the change to colour. At ninety minutes in length, Wagon Train did not prove to be successful, and it returned both to being an hour long in length and being shot in back and white in the following season. That same season the TV series Arrest and Trial debuted. Ninety minutes long, the first part of the show followed a police detective trying a case, while the second part of the show featured a defence attorney defending the individual arrested by the detective. It lasted only one season. CBS tried its own 90 minute Western with Cimarron Strip. Debuting at the start of the 1967 season, it only lasted one season.  The Name of the Game, debuting on NBC in 1968, proved to be somewhat successful. It ran three seasons. Of course, following the cancellation of The Men From Shiloh, NBC would debut The NBC Mystery Movie. Also produced by Universal, the umbrella title may be the most successful ninety minute show of all time.The Virginian would also be responsible for another NBC Western produced by Universal TV. The 1965 episode \"We've Lost a Train\" was a backdoor pilot for the comedy Western Laredo. Laredo debuted on September 16 1965 and ran for two seasons. While The Virginian ended its run in 1971 as The Men From Shiloh, it was hardly gone. It would have a successful run in syndication. and has aired on Encore Westerns, Insp, and Cozi TV. The entire series, including its final season as The Men From Shiloh, is available on DVD.At nine seasons, The Virginian is tied with Wagon Train as the third longest running broadcast network Western TV series. It has also persisted in syndication ever since it left network airwaves. The show still maintains a large following of fans, many of who weren't even born when the show debuted. It seems likely people will be watching The Virginian sixty years from now."},

{"title": "The Ipcress File (1965)", "date": "Sunday, September 18, 2022", "text": "(This post is part of the 9th Annual Rule, Britannia Blogathon, hosted by A Shroud of Thoughts)The debut of the TV shows Danger Man in 1960 and The Avengers in 1961 would mark the beginning of a spy craze in the United Kingdom. In 1962 Dr. No, the first movie in the James Bond series, would bring the spy craze to the United States. On both sides of the Pond there would be a plethora of TV shows and movies capitalizing on the craze for secret agents. Many of the Bond imitators that sprang up during the spy craze were nearly superhuman, battling larger than life villains and boasting expense accounts that would put Jed Clampett to shame. There was one spy from Sixties movies who broke with the rest. Harry Palmer (Michael Caine) was decidedly working class. He was so near-sighted that he was nearly blind without his glasses. Although he was a formidable opponent, it was not unusual for him to come out on the losing end of fights. He was also cynical and somewhat disillusioned with life. Harry Palmer made his film debut in The Ipcress File (1965), which would be followed by the movies Funeral in Berlin (1966) and Billion Dollar Brain (1967). The Ipcress File was based on the novel The IPCRESS File by Len Deighton. It was Mr. Deighton's debut novel. The novel centred on an unnamed, cynical, working class intelligence officer who finds himself investigating the disappearance of several important figures. The investigation ultimately involves American testing of a neutron bomb and mind control. Len Deighton was hired by Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, producers of the James Bond movies, to write the screenplay for the second James Bond movie, From Russia with Love (1963). When Len Deighton failed to make any headway on the script, he was let go from the movie. Regardless, he sold the film rights to The IPCRESS File to Eon Productions.That The IPCRESS File should appeal to Harry Saltzman should come as no surprise. He had produced some pivotal kitchen sink dramas before producing the Bond movies, including Look Back in Anger (1958), Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960), and The Entertainer (1960). Indeed, Sir Michael Caine: The Biography by William Hall quotes Harry Saltzman as having said, \"Let me explain: James Bond had spawned a lot of stupid clones of Superman secret agent heroes. But Deighton had created a spy who was a loser. A real person. He doesn't get up and have champagne and caviar for breakfast, and he doesn't hop into bed with every beautiful woman that comes by. He worries about how to pay the rent at the end of the month.\" Indeed, in the film The Ipcress File Harry Palmer is a very different sort of spy from James Bond. While Bond had an upper class upbringing and attended Eton, Harry had a working class background. While Bond was a Commander in the Royal Navy, Harry was a mere Sergeant. While Bond has an extravagant expense account, Harry receives a modest pay cheque. While Bond had an array of gadgets provided to him by Q, all Harry has is his gun and his wits. Indeed, while Bond drives an Aston Martin, Harry drives a blue Ford Zodiac. It is perhaps Harry's superior Major Dalby who sums up Harry best when he reads from Harry's B107 in The Ipcress File, \"Insubordinate. Insolent. A trickster. Perhaps with criminal tendencies.\" Indeed, the only reason Harry became a spy was to avoid being put in military prison for theft.Harry Saltzman gave a copy of the novel The IPCRESS File to screenwriter Jimmy Sangster, best known for his work on such Hammer Horrors as The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), Dracula (1958--known in the US as Horror of Dracula), and The Mummy (1959). It was Jimmy Sangster who suggested  that Mr. Saltzman take a look at the movie The Leather Boys (1964), directed by a young director named Sidney J. Furie. Previously Sidney J. Furie had directed the horror movie Dr. Blood's Coffin (1961) and the Cliff Richard vehicles The Young Ones (1961) and Wonderful Life (1964). Producer Walter Shenson had offered Mr. Furie what would become A Hard Day's Night (1964), but he declined it. The cinematographer on The Ipcress File was Otto Heller, who had earlier shot such classics as The Lady Killers (1955) and Peeping Tom (1960). Others who worked on The Ipcress File were veterans of the James Bond movies: Ken Adam, who had served as production designer on Dr. No and Goldfinger (1964); composer John Barry, who composed the scores for Dr. No, From Russia with Love; and Goldfinger; Peter R. Hunt, who had edited the James Bond films; and yet others.With regards to the screenplay, Jimmy Sangster very much wanted to write it, but he and Harry Saltzman could never come to an agreement on the time frame as to when it would be completed. Ken Hughes, who had written several screenplays since 1953, wrote a screenplay for The Ipcress File that Harry Saltzman rejected. In the end the screenplay was written by Bill Canaway and James Doran. Bill Canaway was a  novelist who also wrote the screenplay for the movie Sammy Going South (1963). James Doran had worked primarily in television.While it might seem odd to think of anyone else but Michael Caine as Harry Palmer, Christopher Plummer was initially considered for the role of the protagonist of The Ipcress File. Christopher Plummer turned the role down as he had received a higher paying offer to star in The Sound of Music (1965). Harry Saltzman had seen Michael Caine as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead in Zulu (1964). It was only a few days after seeing the movie that he met Michael Caine in a restaurant. In sharp contrast to his upper crust character in Zulu, Mr. Caine wore a polo-neck sweater and spoke with a Cockney accent. He had found his working class spy.It would ultimately be Michael Caine who would choose the name of the protagonist of The Ipcress File. In the novel The IPCRESS File, the protagonist is never given a name, although he is called \"Harry\" once and cannot remember if he ever used that name. Of course, for the movie the production team felt that their hero needed a name, something common and unremarkable. Michael Caine told Harry Saltzman about a dull boy he had known at school named \"Palmer.\" Harry Saltzman then asked Michael Caine about a first name (according to some accounts he asked, \"What is the dullest name you can think of?\"). Inadvertently and meaning no insult to Harry Saltzman, Michael Caine blurted out, \"Harry.\" Michael Caine realized he had made a bit of a faux pas, but fortunately Harry Saltzman was amused rather than insulted. Len Deighton's unnamed working class spy then became \"Harry Palmer.\"Making The Ipcress File did not always proceed smoothly. Director Sidney Furie and producer Harry Saltzman had a number of clashes while making the film. Mr. Furie was not particularly fond of the movie's script, so much so that he set fire to it on the first day of shooting. Harry Saltzman hated Sidney Furie's framing technique so much that he banned him from the editing room. At one point, while on location at Shepherd's Bush in West Londin, Sidney Furie was convinced he was going to be fired from the picture and hopped on a bus. Fortunately, he was persuaded to return to the set.Despite any difficulties that arose during The Ipcress File, the film proved to be a success. It received mostly positive reviews on both sides of the Pond. It also did very well at the box office, guaranteeing there would be a second Harry Palmer movie (Funeral in Berlin in 1966). It won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film and Ken Adam won the BAFTA Award for Best British Art Direction, Colour. The key to the success of The Ipcress File may well be the character of Harry Palmer himself. In contrast to the many James Bond clones, not only is Harry Palmer strictly working class and far from superhuman, but he is an intellectual who loves cooking, books, and classical music. About the only thing he has in common with James Bond is, to paraphrase fellow spy Jean Courtney (Sue Lloyd) in the film, that he likes girls. Harry Palmer was a much more human character than many of the superspies so prevalent during the spy craze of the Sixties.Not only is Harry Palmer a very different character from other fictional spies of the era, but overall The Ipcress File is a very different movie. The Ipcress File looks more like Harry Saltzman's earlier kitchen sink dramas than a Bond movie. The London of The Ipcress File is not Swinging London, but a darker, seedier London,complete with smog and rundown buildings. Harry's flat is a far cry from the bachelor pads featured in other spy movies of the time. While The Ipcress File looks like a kitchen sink drama, it feels very much like a film noir. Harry Palmer exists in a world of espionage where it can be difficult to know whom to trust and whom not to. Even Harry's co-workers can be suspect. And just as many of the best film noirs are police procedurals, The Ipcress File could be described as an \"espionage procedural.\" Indeed, much of Harry's time is spent on leg work and paper work. Even the various intelligence departments sometimes find it difficult to cooperate with each other. For Harry Palmer, being a spy is hardly glamorous.The Ipcress File would have a lasting impact. It differed from the Bondian spy dramas that were dominant at the time and set a precedent for a more realistic spy drama. It led to two sequels, Funeral in Berlin and Billion Dollar Brain, in the Sixties, followed by the TV movies Bullet to Beijing and Midnight in St. Petersburg in the Nineties. A six part mini-series, The Ipcress File, debuted on ITV this year, with Joe Cole playing Harry Palmer.Today The Ipcress File is considered a classic. In 1999 it ranked at no. 59 on the BFI's list of the Top 100 British Films. Its influence would also prove to be far reaching, from television shows such as Callan to movies such as The Bourne Identity (2002). Harry Palmer may not be as influential as James Bond, but in many respects he would also have a huge impact."},
{"title": "The TV Series M*A*S*H Turns 50", "date": "Saturday, September 17, 2022", "text": "It was fifty years ago today, on September 17 1972, that the TV show M*A*S*H debuted on CBS. M*A*S*H would go onto become one of the most successful television shows of all time. Only ranking at no. 46 for its first season, by its second season M*A*S*H had risen to no. 4 for the year. It would remain in the top twenty in the Nielsens each year for the rest of its eleven year run, nine of those years in the top ten. After it ended its run in 1983, M*A*S*H entered syndication where it would have a very successful run. In fact, it is still airing in syndication to this day.The entire series is also available on DVD and it is also available on streaming. Like the novel and movie before it, M*A*S*H centred on the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital near Uijeongbu, South Korea during the Korean War. The primary focus of the show in its early days were surgeons Captain Benjamin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce (Alan Alda) and \"Trapper\" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers). They shared their tent in \"the Swamp\" with Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville), an inept, but well-to-do surgeon who usually blamed others whenever he made  a mistake. He also has a tendency to go by the book, although he often behaves as if the rules don't apply to him. The head nurse was Major Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Switt), who was regular Army and the daughter of a career Army officer. She is a firm believer in military discipline. Initially having an affair with Frank Burns, she would evolve into a more sympathetic character through the course of the series. The commanding officer of the 4077th was Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson). Henry was very down-to-earth and laid back, and never strict on military discipline, so much so he wasn't particularly effective as a commanding officer. Corporal Walter \"Radar\" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff) was the company clerk. He grew up on a farm near Ottumwa, Iowa and was somewhat naive. He loved comic books, slept with a teddy bear, loved Nehi grape soda, and had an extensive menagerie of animals. Father John Mulcahy (William Christopher) was the unit's chaplain. Although very religious, Father Mulcahy served somewhat as comedy relief early on the series, but became a more serious character as the show went along. While many of the characters were not religious, they still often turn to Father Mulcahy for advice. The origins of  the TV series M*A*S*H can be traced back to the novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors by Richard Hooker (the pen name of Dr. H. Richard Hornberger, who was an Army surgeon during the Korean War). Published in 1968, MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors was adapted as the 20th Century Fox movie M*A*S*H (1970). The movie proved to be a hit at the box office, ultimately making $81.6 million at the box office. It also received mostly positive notices from critics at the time, and it was nominated for five Oscars. It won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay – Based on Material from Another Medium for screenwriter Ring Lardner Jr. Such success was not lost on William Self. President of 20th Century Fox Television. William Self turned to Gene Reynolds to bring M*A*S*H to the small screen. He had directed episodes of such shows as The Farmer's Daughter, My Three Sons, and Hogan's Heroes, and produced episodes of the TV series Room 222. Gene Reynolds brought Larry Gelbart onto the project as a writer and a producer. Larry Gelbart had a long career in comedy, having written for the TV shows The Colgate Comedy Hour, Four Star Revue, and Caesar's Hour, as well as having written the book for the Broadway musical A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum. He wrote the story for the movie The Thrill of It All (1963) and the screenplay for The Wrong Box (1966). While Larry Gelbart left the series after its fourth season, he would have a lasting impact on it. Larry Gelbart insisted on realism in the scenes in the operating scenes. He fought for M*A*S*H to not have a laugh track, finally getting the network to agree that there would be no laugh track during operating room scenes. Larry Gelbart was also the reason the show, although set during the Korean War, would serve as a commentary upon the then ongoing Vietnam War in its early years. The pilot (simply titled \"Pilot\") was written by Larry Gelbart. CBS then picked the series up and scheduled it on Sunday at 8:00 PM Eastern/7:00 PM Central. Ratings for the show then proved to be less than stellar, with it only coming in at no. 46 for the year. Fortunately, for its second season, M*A*S*H was moved to Saturday night at 8:30 PM Eastern/7:30 PM Central, following the hit All in the Family. Its ratings rose to no. 4 for the season. While CBS and the producers would at times come to heads, one thing that both agreed upon was that M*A*S*H must be medically accurate. Larry Gelbart devoted a good deal of time researching Army medicine during the Korean War, interviewing doctors who had served in the Army during the Korean War. The show also attempted to recreate a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War as realistically as possible. In fact, the 4077th was largely modelled after the real-life 8055 during the Korean War. That having been said, some concessions were made for the medium of television. The actual 8055 had 10 doctors, 12 nurses, and 200 beds, with 248 individuals serving in the company. The 4077th on M*A*S*H was much more modest, with fewer doctors, fewer nurses, fewer beds, and a smaller operating room. M*A*S*H would also depart from reality in other ways. With regards to the racial composition of the actual MASH units during the Korean War, African Americans made up 14 to 18 percent of the personnel. The nurses serving in the actual MASH units during the Korean War also tended to be much older than the nurses serving in the 4077th on M*A*S*H. Indeed, most of the nurses who served in the Korean War tended to be career Army.Over time M*A*S*H would evolve. Characters would change over time from their movie counterparts. Characters would also be added, while others would leave. Captain Oliver \"Spearchucker\" Jones (Timothy Brown) was one of the show's few Black characters. He was a surgeon who had been a champion javelin thrower in college (hence his nickname, which could be considered racially insensitive). The character was eventually dropped during the first season. Corporal Max Klinger (Jamie Farr) was the first character to be introduced on the show who was in neither the novel nor the movie. Klinger first appeared in the show's fourth episode, \"Chief Surgeon, Who?\". Klinger was inspired by a story Larry Gelberat had heard about comedian Lenny Bruce trying to be released from the Navy during World War II by wearing a WAVES uniform. For that reason, Klinger wore dresses in an attempt to get a Section 8 (a discharge on grounds of mental illness). Jamie Farr was hired for only one day to play Corporal Klinger in \"Chief Surgeon, Who?,\" but the character proved to be so popular that he became a recurring character. By the fourth season, he was promoted to being a regular character. \"Radar and Klinger would not be the only enlisted men who would appear multiple times on M*A*S*H. Private Igor Straminsky (Jeff Maxwell, although Peter Riegert played him in two episodes of the sixth season) first appeared in the second season episode \"5 O' Clock Charlie.\" Igor most often served food in the mess hall, although he sometimes had other duties as well. Igor would continue to appear until the end of the series. Among the nurses, Lt. Kellye Yamato (Kellye Nkhaara) may have appeared the most. She first appeared in the second season episode \"Divided, We Stand.\" She remained until the end of the show. Initially appearing only briefly in episodes, as time went by Kellye played a  more important role.Among the most popular recurring characters on M*A*S*H was psychiatrist Major Sidney Freedman (Allan Arbus). He was not permanently assigned to the 4077th, but was called upon to treat any mental difficulties that arose. He first appeared in the second season episode \"Radar's Report,\" although originally his first name was \"Milton.\" He continued to appear in various episodes until the end of the series, including the series finale. One of the show's few recurring antagonists was Colonel Samuel Flagg (Edward Winter). Flagg was an American intelligence officer, although he was often unclear on whom he actually worked for (over time he claimed to work for the CIA, the CIC, and the CID) . Flagg also displayed a good deal of paranoia, and most of the 4077th thought he was insane, a diagnosis Sidney Freedman appeared to agree with. Edward Winter first appeared in the second season M*A*S*H episode \"Deal Me Out,\" playing a character named Captain Halloran. There are those who believe that Halloran may have been Flagg using a different rank and name, given the characters are nearly identical. He first appeared as Colonel Flagg in the second season episode \"A Smattering of Intelligence.\" He continued to appear until the seventh season.M*A*S*H had a very large ensemble, and it is difficult to include all the recurring characters in one blog post. This is complicated by the fact that M*A*S*H underwent several changes in its lead cast through the years. Wayne Rogers, who played Trapper John, left after the show's third season. Originally, Trapper John was meant to be as important as Hawkeye, but as the series progressed and Hawkeye proved popular, less and less attention was being paid to Trapper John. In the novel, movie, and originally on the TV show, Trapper was the 4077th's thoracic surgeon. It was with in the first season episode \"Dear Dad\" that Hawkeye was also made a thoracic surgeon, thus making Trapper John a less special character. While Wayne Rogers enjoyed working on M*A*S*H and enjoyed working with its cast, he felt that Trapper was not getting his due and so he left the series. Trapper John was then written out of the show as having been discharged from the Army.He was replaced by Captain B. J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell). B.J. came from a family of doctors and was happily married to his wife Peg and he had a daughter named Erin. He was more reserved than either Hawkeye or Trapper, and often acted as the voice of reason for Hawkeye. While he did not care for military discipline and was prone to practical jokes much as Hawkeye was, he also had a stronger moral compass, sometimes refusing to go along with Hawkeye's schemes on moral grounds. McClean Stevenson as Henry Blake also left the show after its third season. He was uncomfortable in playing what had become a supporting role to Hawkeye and wanted the opportunity to have a starring role on a show, having played in ensembles for years. Lt. Col. Henry Blake was written out of the show as having received a discharge from the Army. His departure would prove to be a source of controversy. As many men did not make it home from the Korean War even after their discharge, in the episode \"Abyssinia, Henry,\" in which Lt. Col. Blake was set to return home, Radar enters the operating room and reports the sad news that the plane carrying Henry was shot down over the Sea of Japan and that there were no survivors. The producers received over 1000 letters from viewers in reaction to the episode, which was decidedly mixed. Some accepted Henry's death as part of the realities of war. Others objected to his death, thinking it was not fitting for a television comedy. Not only were some viewers unhappy with Henry's death, but so too were CBS and 20th Century Fox. In fact, CBS went so far that when \"Abyssinia, Henry\" was rerun that summer, they simply cut the finale in which Radar reports Henry's death from the episode.McClean Stevenson was replaced by Harry Morgan as Col. Sherman T. Potter. Col. Potter was a sharp contrast to Henry. He was a career Army doctor who had first entered the miliary as part of the cavalry in World War I. Col. Potter was stricter with regards to military discipline than Henry ever was, but at the same time he was very laid back, realizing how much pressure the surgeons and nurses were under. He was from Hannibal, Missouri, and had been married to his wife Mildred for years. Given their ages, Col. Potter and Mildred not only had children, but grandchildren. Col Potter loved horses and he was a big fan of Western novels. The staff of the 4077th had enormous respect for Col. Potter, and he is one of the few officers that Hawkeye and B.J. ever saluted.  Larry Linville would leave the show after its fifth season. He simply felt that he had taken the character of Major Burns as far as he could take him. Frank Burns would be written out of the show as having a mental breakdown in the wake of Major Houlihan's marriage to Lt. Col. Donald Penobscott. He was replaced by Major Charles Emerson Winchester III. Much as Col. Potter was a sharp contrast to Lt. Col. Blake, so too was Winchester a sharp contrast to Frank Burns. For one thing, not only Major Winchester a competent surgeon, but he was actually one of the best surgeons in Boston. He was the scion of a wealthy family who lived on Beacon Hill and could sometimes be a snob. Like Frank Burns, Winchester could be adversarial to both Hawkeye and B. J., but at the same time he often takes their side. Unlike Frank Burns, Winchester, although he might be loathe to admit, respects Hawkeye and B.J. and counts them as friends. Although raised in wealth, Winchester was capable of great acts of charity.The last major cast change on M*A*S*H was the departure of Gary Burghoff. He left the show in its seventh season primarily to spend more time with his family. Unlike the other major characters on the show, Radar was written out of the show as having been given a hardship discharge following the death of his Uncle Ed. Unlike other characters, Radar was not replaced, but instead Kliinger simply took over being company clerk. While M*A*S*H went though several cast changes in its run, it also changed in tone over the years. Upon its debut, M*A*S*H was essentially a situation comedy with some dramatic elements. Eventually M*A*S*H would evolve into what was later called a \"dramedy,\" combing elements of both comedy and drama. Even in its earliest days, M*A*S*H could shift from a scene that was highly comedic to one that was very dramatic. As the series progressed, the show's episodes also became much more character driven than they had before.While in its early days M*A*SH more often than not focused on Hawkeye and Trapper, as the seasons progressed it became much more of an ensemble show.In keeping with being a dramedy, M*A*S*H often pushed the envelope as to what could be done on a television series. A prime example of this is the aforementioned death of Henry Blake. Characters on situation comedies had been killed off before. After Jean Hagen left Make Room for Daddy  following its third season, her character was written off the show as having died in between seasons. What set Henry Blake's death apart from earlier instances of character deaths on situation comedies is that the character of Henry actually appeared in the episode in which he was killed off. As noted above, the move would prove controversial.M*A*S*H was also the first primetime, network show to feature nudity, although it was brief. In the second season episode \"The Sniper,\" Radar briefly loses his towel while fleeing from the sniper of the title. M*A*S*H was also pioneering in its use of strong language.In the eighth season episode \"Guerilla My Dreams,\" Hawkeye actually calls Lt. Park, a South Korean intelligence officer visiting the 4077th to take a wounded North Korean woman into custody, \"a son of a bitch.\" For the year 1979 that was extremely strong language on American television (keep in mind it was only a few years earlier that the word \"Hell\" couldn't even be uttered).M*A*S*H often toyed with television storytelling. The 4th season episode \"Deluge\" actually rotated scenes of the doctors in the 4077th at work with actual newsreel footage from the Korean War. Another 4th season episode, \"The Interview,\" was shot entirely in black and white (except for the credits) and featured an American news correspondent interviewing the staff of the 4077th about their work and their experiences in Korea. The eighth season episode \"Life Time\" was told in real time, as they attempt to save a wounded soldier. Also in the eighth season, the episode \"Dreams\" portrayed the staff of the 4077th working with little sleep and the dreams they have when they do get a little time to nap. The 9th season episode \"A War for All Seasons\" unfolded through the course of a year. Finally, the eleventh season episode \"Point of View\" was told from the point of view of a wounded soldier.Throughout its eleven years on the air, M*A*S*H received several Emmy nominations. Ultimately it won 14 Emmy Awards. Following its first season, it also received high ratings, ranking in the top ten shows every year except for its fourth season (when it came in at a still respectable no. 15 for the year). When it ended its run it was the 3rd highest rated show for the season.As the seasons passed, it became harder and harder for the producers to find storylines that had not already been done on M*A*S*H before. Alan Alda and other producers then wanted to end the show with its tenth season, but CBS persuaded them to make a shorter 11th season with a two hour series finale. The final original episode,  \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen,\" aired on February 28 1983. The episode drew a total of 121.6 million viewers. It remains both the most watched episode of an American television series and the most watched series finale to this day. M*A*S*H would produce two spinoff series. The first to debut was the medical drama Trapper John, M.D., in 1979. On the series Pernell Roberts played Trapper, now working as the Chief of Surgery at San Francisco Memorial Hospital. Although a spinoff of M*A*S*H, the producers of the original show actually had nothing to do with Trapper John, M.D. Instead, the show was a product of 20th Century Fox, who had produced the 1970 movie and the TV show M*A*S*H. Trapper John, M.D. would prove successful. It ran for seven seasons.The second spinoff to M*A*S*H was also a direct sequel to the show. CBS was not ready to give up on the M*A*S*H franchise when the show ended its run. AfterMASH took place immediately following the Korean War. After returning home, Sherman T. Potter became the chief of staff at General Pershing Veteran's Hospital in Missouri. He was joined by Klinger, whom he hired as his administrative assistant. Father Mulcahy became General Pershing Veteran's Hospital's chaplain. A few characters from the original series would appear on AfterMASH. Colonel Flagg appeared in the episode \"Trials,\" investigating Klinger as a suspect Communist sympathizer or an outright Communist. Radar appeared in two first season episodes. While Sidney Freedman never appeared on AfterMASH, in one episode Sherman T. Potter is writing a letter to him. AfterMASH received respectable ratings in its first season, ranking at no. 15 for the year. It also received largely negative reviews. The show was overhauled a bit for its second season, and the show was moved to Tuesday. Unfortunately, this placed it opposite NBC's megahit The A-Team. Its ratings dropped dramatically and it was ultimately cancelled.Gary Burghoff's guest appearances on AfterMASH would lead to one last, proposed spinoff of M*A*S*H. In the proposed spinoff, W*A*L*T*E*R, Walter O'Reilly, no longer using his nickname \"Radar,\" must leave the family farm in Iowa and take a job as a police officer in St. Louis, Missouri. CBS did not pick up the series, but aired the pilot only once, on July 17 1984. M*A*S*H was a huge departure from previous service comedies that had aired on American television. Previous service comedies (such as The Phil Silvers Show) were often set during peacetime. Even when a service comedy was made during a time of war, it often avoided any mention of that war. A perfect example of this is Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C., which never mentioned the Vietnam War. When a service comedy did have a wartime setting, such as McHale's Navy and Hogan's Heroes, it was usually set during in an earlier time period (in the case of those two sitcoms, World War II) and strenuously avoided the realities of war. M*A*S*H was set during the Korean War and never avoided the harsh realities of war. The scenes in the operating room could be graphic for the era. The doctors and nurses were often overworked. It was not unusual for characters to die, in one instance one of the lead characters. While M*A*S*H was often comedic in tone, it always took the subject of war very seriously. This was a sharp break from earlier service comedies.M*A*S*H was also revolutionary in its blend of comedy and drama. It is quite possible that M*A*S*H was the first dramedy to air on American television. At the very least it was the first successful one. Arguably, the success of M*A*S*H opened the doors for such dramedies as Moonlighting, The Wonder Years, Northern Exposure, and others. It also revolutionized the way stories could be told on television. As noted above, many of its episodes broke with the usual, straightforward plotlines of American television, with an episode told from the point of view of a particular character and told in real time. The fact that M*A*S*H differed a good deal from previous shows on American television may explain much of its success, but it also seems likely that much of its success was also because it was a character driven show. Between an excellent writing staff and a great cast, the episodes of the show explored the staff of the 4077th in a way that no previous sitcoms had explored their characters before. Indeed, M*A*S*H may be one of the very few shows from which the average person can actually name most of the characters.Ever since M*A*S*H ended its original run on CBS it has persisted in syndication. It is also available on DVD and it is available on streaming. Arguably, it was not only one of the most successful shows of the Seventies, but also one of the most success TV shows of all time. It may well be safe to say that in 50 years viewers will still be watching M*A*S*H."},

{"title": "The 50th Anniversary of The Waltons", "date": "Thursday, September 15, 2022", "text": "Yesterday was the 50th anniversary of the TV show The Waltons. It debuted on CBS on September 15 1972. The Waltons centred on the family of that name, who lived in rural Virginia upon the fictional Walton's Mountain in the fictional Jefferson County. The series began at the height of the Great Depression in 1933. The series concluded shortly after the end of World War II. The main character on the show was John Walton Jr. (Richard Thomas), called \"John Boy,\" who began the show as an aspiring writer. His parents were John  Walton Sr. (Ralph Waite) and Olivia Walton (Michael Learned). John Boy's grandparents, Zebulon Walton (Will Geer) and Esther Walton (Ellen Corby), lived with them. John Boy had several brothers and sisters: second oldest Jason, an aspiring musician; eldest daughter and tomboy Mary Ellen ((Judy North Taylor); middle sister Erin (Mary Elizabeth McDonough); middle brother Ben (Eric Scott); youngest son and aspiring pilot Jim-Bob; and youngest child Elizabeth (Kami Cotter). The Waltons shopped at the local general store on Walton's Mountain, ran by Ike Godsey (Joe Conley). While The Waltons debuted to low ratings, it would become one of the most successful shows of the Seventies. It ultimately ran for nine seasons.The origins of The Waltons can be traced back to the 1961 novel Spencer's Mountain by Earl Hamner Jr. The novel was adapted as the 1963 motion picture of the same name, starring Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara. The movie differed a good deal from the novel. While the novel was set in the Great Depression, the movie was set in the early Sixties. Also, while the novel was set in Virginia, the movie was set in Wyoming. It was in 1970 that a sequel to the novel Spencer's Mountain, The Homecoming: A Novel About Spencer's Mountain, was published. Lee Rich of Lorimar Productions bought the television rights to The Homecoming: A Novel About Spencer's Mountain to adapt as a TV movie. Because Warner Bros. still owned the film rights to the novel Spencer's Mountain, the names of the characters were changed. For that reason, the Spencers became the Waltons, Clayboy became John Boy, and so on. The Homecoming: A Christmas Story aired on CBS on December 19 1971 on The CBS Sunday Night Movie. Except for Ellen Corby as Grandma and the children, The Homecoming: A Christmas Story had a different cast from the subsequent TV series: Patricia Neal played Olivia Walton, Edgar Bergen played Grandpa Walton, and Andrew Duggan played John Walton. Even storekeep Ike Godsey was played by a different actor. He was played by Woodrow Parfrey. Like the TV series, author Earl Hamner Jr. served as the narrator, playing the adult John Walton Jr.The Homecoming: A Christmas Story proved to be phenomenally successful in the Nielsen ratings. While it was not meant to be the pilot for a TV series, its success led to the TV series nonetheless. Despite the TV movie's success, CBS would insist that the father be played by a big name in order to draw in viewers. For that reason, Lorimar Productions approached Henry Fonda, who had played Clay Spencer in the movie Spencer's Mountain (1963), to play John Walton Sr. After watching The Homecoming: A Christmas Story, he said Lorimar, \"What do you want me for? The family is the star. You don't need me.\" Ultimately, Ralph Waite was cast in the role. As to the role of Olivia Walton, the part went to Michael Learned, billed as \"Miss Michael Learned\" because of her unusual first name. As to Edgar Bergen, his health was in decline and as a result he was replaced by Will Geer.The Waltons debuted on September 14 1972. While its competition on ABC was not particularly impressive (The Mod Squad had been declining in the ratings), it was opposite The Flip Wilson Show on NBC, then one of the highest rated shows on television. Despite getting overwhelmingly positive reviews, The Waltons was then not expected to last. Given the fact that the network scheduled The Waltons against the no. 2 show on the air, there are those who believe CBS simply picked up the show to appease representatives and senators in Congress, not to mention moral watchdogs, concerned about sex and violence on television. Regardless, there were those at CBS who apparently believed in the show. Lou Dorfsman, design director at CBS, created a print ad extolling the show and making reference to its critical acclaim. The ad turned things around for The Waltons. Initially suffering from low ratings, its ratings climbed until it was ultimately no. 19 for the year in the Nielsens. By its second season, it was the no. 2 rated show for the year. As to the show that was expected to kill The Waltons,  The Flip Wilson Show dropped in the ratings. For its fourth and final season, it came in at no. 50 for the year. Given The Waltons grew out of The Homecoming: A Novel About Spencer's Mountain, the show's characters were essentially the same as those in the novel Spencer's Mountain. Warner Bros. still owned the rights to the novel. To avoid a lawsuit, Lorimar then sold the distribution rights to the show to Warner Bros. Of course, in 1989 Lorimar was acquired by Warner Bros., so that now Warner Bros. owns the series.Centred on a large family consisting of parents, grandparents, and seven children, The Waltons had a large cast. What made the show's cast even larger was a number of semi-regular and recurring characters who played the inhabitants of Walton's Mountain and neighbouring communities. Mamie (Helen Kleeb) and Emily Baldwin (Mary Jackson) were a pair of elderly spinsters who made what they called \"Papa's recipe,\" thinking it a simple elixir and not realizing it was outright moonshine. Mamie was the more sensible of the two, while Emily was the romantic. She is still fixated on an old beau, Ashley Longworth, who she still expects to return to her after decades. Yancy Tucker (Robert Donner) was the local handyman, who, at times, engaged in such things as chicken theft. Verdie Grant (Lynn Hamilton) began the show as a widow, who had two adult sons and three adult daughters. She was one of the African American characters on the show. Sheriff Ep Bridges (John Crawford) was the sheriff of Jefferson County and a close friend of the Walton family. Reverend Matthew Fordwick (John Ritter) was their church's pastor, while Rosemary Hunter (Mariclare Costello) was their school's teacher. As The Waltons progressed, yet more characters would be added to the show. In the second season itinerant worker Harley Foster arrived on Walton's Mountain, where he met and married Verdie Grant.H Harley had a young son named Jody (Erin Blunt). Later Harley and Verdie would adopt an orphan named Josh (Todd Bridges). It was in the second season that Ike Godsey met and married John Walton's second cousin Corabeth (Ronnie Claire Edwards). As the Walton children grew older, some of them would also marry. Mary Ellen married Dr. Curtis Willard (Tom Bower), who was thought to be killed Pearl Harbour. Ben married Cindy Brunson (Robin Eisenman), and they later had a daughter. The Waltons featured several recurring characters, so many that it would be hard to list them all.Over the years The Waltons went through several changes. Among these were changes in the cast. John Ritter left the series in its fifth season, having been cast on the sitcom Three's Company. Richard Thomas, John Boy himself, left the show after its sixth season out of fears that he might become typecast. Ellen Corby had a stroke during the show's fifth season, and had to leave The Waltons for a time (although she still received her credit). Ellen Corby returned in the sixth season, which, sadly, would be the last season on which Will Geer appeared. He died of respiratory failure at age 76 on April 22 1976. Grandpa was then written out of the show as having died between seasons. Ellen Corby remained with the show until its eighth season, leaving due to declining health. As if the loss of Richard Thomas, Will Geer, and Ellen Corby was not enough, it was in the seventh season that Michael Learned left the show. Olivia was then written out of the show as having contracted tuberculosis and having to go to a sanitarium. Ralph Waite would also leave the show in its ninth season. It was explained that John went to be with Olivia. To fill the void left by characters no longer on the show, The Waltons would add characters in its later years. Rose Burton (Peggy Rea) was Olivia's cousin, who moved in with the Waltons to take over keeping the house in Grandma and Olivia's absence. She had two young grandchildren, Jeffrey (Keith Coogan) and Serena (Martha Nix). Jeffrey and Serena would only appear in the show's eighth season, although Rose remained with the show until nearly its end, marrying her beau Stanley Perkins (William Schallert) in the ninth season. One bit of casting that has always been controversial with fans was the recasting of John Boy. The character returned to the show in its eighth season, this time played by Robert Wightman. Robert Wightman remained with the show until its end and even played John Boy in the first reunion movie (A Wedding on Walton's Mountain in 1982).While the various cast changes would alter The Waltons, the show would also see changes due to the passage of time. Beginning in 1933, for each season roughly one year would pass in its early years. It was with the fifth season that suddenly two years would pass for every season. With two years passing in each season, by the seventh season The Waltons had entered World War II. A might be expected, with World War II The Waltons was sometimes darker than it had been, with recurring characters on the show actually being killed off.Over the years the credit sequence also changed. In its first season the credits portrayed John Walton Sr. bringing home the family's new radio, with shots of the various characters. With the second season the credit sequence was changed to a montage of sepia still photographs. With changes made to the credits to accommodate changes in the cast, the sepia credit sequence remained in place until the end of the show's run. Today there is tendency to think of The Waltons as a wholesome, even a saccharine show. In truth, The Waltons covered some very serious issues throughout its run. Multiple episodes addressed racism, both against African Americans and in one episode (\"The Medal\") against Chicanos. Anti-Semitism was also addressed more than once. Among the other issues addressed by The Waltons were poverty, illness, war, pacifism, post traumatic stress, and spousal abuse. The show even addressed drug addiction using one of its own characters. In \"The Obsession,\" Mary Ellen becomes addicted to amphetamines while studying for her nursing exam. The Waltons was certainly a wholesome show given it centred on a close-knit, loving family, but it was also a very progressive show.&nbspIt was perhaps because of the changes in the show over the years, particularly the death of Will Geer, that The Waltons would decline in the ratings as time passed. It remained in the top twenty until its seventh season, when it dropped to no. 37 for the year. The show was ultimately cancelled with its ninth season. The Waltons was filmed on rear part of the Warner Bros. lot, with the mountains in the background actually being the Hollywood Hills. With the series' end, the facade of the Waltons' home was torn down. A replica of the Waltons' house would be built for the reunion movies, on the old Columbia Ranch. This house would later serve as the Dragonfly Inn on Gilmore Girls, among other things. While The Waltons ended its run in 1981, the show was hardly gone. Aside from having a highly successful run as a syndicated rerun, there were also reunion movies. It was in 1981 that NBC aired the first of three reunion movies, A Wedding on Walton's Mountain. It was followed in 1982 by Mother's Day on Walton's Mountain and A Day for Thanks on Walton's Mountain. It would be ten years before another reunion would air. A Walton Thanksgiving Reunion aired on CBS marked the return of Richard Thomas as John Boy. It would be followed by two more reunion movies: A Walton Wedding in 1995 and A Walton Easter in 1997.Last year a reboot of The Homecoming: A Christmas Story, The Waltons: A Homecoming, aired on The CW. As might be expected, it had an all new cast, although the character of Ben was omitted and Richard Thomas took over as narrator, Earl Hamner Jr. having died a few years ago. It will be followed by another reboot movie this year, A Waltons Thanksgiving, also airing on The CW.Throughout its run The Waltons won several Emmy Awards and it has been in syndication ever since its network run ended. It is definitely one of the most successful shows of the Seventies. As to the reason for its success, part of it may be due to the nostalgia craze that lasted throughout the decade. While many think of the Fifties with regards to the nostalgia craze of the Seventies (a prime example being the show Happy Days), there was also nostalgia for other eras, such as the Depression, as well. The nostalgia craze had actually begun in the Sixties, with renewed interest in Old Time Radio and pulp magazines. As a result, the Seventies would then see several period dramas, from the action adventure shows Bearcats and The Manhunter to the mystery series Ellery Queen. The Waltons would even inspire other period family dramas, such as The Family Holvak and the Saturday morning cartoon These Are the Days. Prior to The Waltons, successful period pieces were a rarity, The Untouchables being a notable exception. Since The Waltons there have been several. As strange as it may seem given how different the two shows are, Mad Men then owes something to The Waltons.The Waltons would also pave the way for other family dramas. In the wake of The Waltons there were such family dramas as Apple's Way (created by Earl Hamner Jr. himself), Family, and Eight is Enough. To a degree The Waltons carved a path for further family dramas, whether or not they are set in the current day or an earlier time.In the end The Waltons  would have a lasting impact on television. It has persisted in syndication ever since its original run ended and inspired further television period pieces and family dramas. Much of this was perhaps due to the show's superior writing, much of it by the show's creator Earl Hamner Jr. Although many today sometimes think of it as a somewhat saccharine show, it was actually much more complicated than that."},
{"title": "Technical Difficulties", "date": "Wednesday, September 14, 2022", "text": "Today I was going to write about the 50th anniversary of The Waltons, which debuted on this date, September 14, in 1972. Unfortunately, we had an internet outage that lasted for hours today, so I was unable to do so. This will make things a bit rough the next few days. I will have to write the post on The Waltons tomorrow. Friday the 9th Annual Rule, Britannia Blogathon begins. The 50th anniversary of The Bob Newhart Show is Friday, but I will have to write about it sometime next week. Quite simply, the 50th anniversary of M*A*S*H is Saturday and Sunday I will want to write my contribution to the Rule, Britannia blogathon. Of course, next week there are yet more television anniversaries... Anyway, if you are wondering why the 50th anniversaries of The Waltons, The Bob Newhart Show, and M*A*S*H all fall so close together, it can be summed up by the phrase \"premiere week.\" From the Forties into the Fifties, the networks tended to debut their new shows throughout the month of September and sometimes even as late as October. This changed in the early to mid-Sixties when the networks began premiering their new shows all in one week in September. The tradition of \"premiere week\" persisted for decades and it has only been in the past few years that they have broken away from it. For fall 1972, CBS's premiere week was from September 11 to September 17. The Waltons, The Bob Newhart Show, and M*A*S*H all aired on CBS, hence they all debuted in the same week.Of course, this means that CBS's premiere week in 1972 was one of the absolute best premiere weeks of all time. Anyway, my post on The Waltons will be out tomorrow evening, barring another internet outage!"},
{"title": "The Late Great Jean-Luc Godard", "date": "Tuesday, September 13, 2022", "text": "Jean-Luc Godard, the legendary filmmaker who revolutionized the cinema with such films as À bout de souffle (1960) and Bande à part (1964), died today, September 13 2022, at the age of 91.Jean-Luc Godard was born on December 3 1930 in Paris, France. His mother, Odile, was the daughter of Julien Monod, a founder of the Banque Paribas, and the great granddaughter of theologian Adolphe Monod. In 1933 the family moved to Switzerland, from which Jean-Luc Godard's father, Paul Godard, came. As a child Jean-Luc Godard was athletic, and he enjoyed football, skiing, basketball, and tennis. He was a teenager when he developed an interest in cinema, having read the essay \"Outline of a Psychology of Cinema\" by André Malraux and the magazine La Revue du cinéma. He studied at the Lycée Buffon in Paris, after which he studied for a time at the Sorbonne. He would soon desert his classes for  ciné-clubs and cinemas of the Latin Quarter. It was there that he would meet such fellow cinephiles as François Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Rivette. In 1950 with  Éric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette he founded the short-lived film journal Gazette du cinéma, which only lasted five issues. Jean-Luc Godard was first published in the legendary film journal  Cahiers du Cinéma in 1952. Jean-Luc Godard's first film was the short subject \"Une femme coquette\" in 1955, made using the name Hans Lucas. He would make several more short subjects before his first feature film Breathless (the French title was À bout de souffle) was released in 1960. In the Sixties, Jean-Luc Godard directed A Woman is a Woman (1961), the segment \"La paresse\" in the film Les sept péchés capitaux, My Life to Live (1962), The Little Soldier (1963), the segment \"Il nuovo mondo' in the film Ro.Go.Pa.G. (1963), The Carabineers (1963), Contempt (1963), Band of Outsiders (1964), A Married Woman (1964), Alphaville (1965), the segment \"Montparnasse-Levallois\" in Paris vu par..., Pierrot le Fou (1965), Masculin féminin (1966), Made in the U.S.A. (1966), Two or Three Things I Know About Her (1967), La  Chinoise (1967), Week End (1967), A Film Like Any Other (1968), and Joy of Learning (1969). He began directing documentaries in the late Sixties, including the films One + One (1968) and British Sounds (1969). In the Seventies Jean-Luc Godard directed the movies Struggle in Italy (1971), Tout va bien (1972),  Comment ça va? (1976), and Every Man for Himself (1980). He directed the documentaries 1 P.M. (1971), Letter to Jane (1972), Number Two (1975), and Ici et ailleurs (1976). He directed the six part documentary television mini-series Six fois deux/Sur et sous la communication and the 12 part documentary television mini-series France/tour/détour/deux/enfants. In the Eighties he directed the feature films Passion (1982), Prénom Carmen (1983), Je vous salue, Marie (1985), King Lear (1987),  and Le rapport Darty (1989). He directed the documentaries Sauve la vie (qui peut) (1981), Scénario du film 'Passion' (1982), and Soft and Hard (1985). He directed an episodes of the TV shows Spécial cinéma and Série noire,  and episodes of the mini-series Les Français vus par. In the Nineties Jean-Luc Godard directed the movies Les enfants jouent à la Russie (1993) and For Ever Mozart (2003). He directed the documentaries JLG/JLG - autoportrait de décembre (1994) and The Old Place (2000). He directed the TV movie Allemagne 90 neuf zéro, and an episode of the TV show Century of Cinema and the 8-part cinema Histoire(s) du cinéma. In the Naughts he directed the films Éloge de l'amour (2001), Notre musique (2004), and Film socialisme (2010). He directed the documentaries Moments choisis des histoire(s) du cinéma  (2001), Vrai faux passeport (2006), and Vrai faux passeport (2006). In the Teens he directed the film Adieu au langage (2014). Jean-Luc Godard also wrote, edited, and produced much of his work. He made several films with actress Anna Karina, to whom he was married for a time. Jean-Luc Godard would have a lasting impact on cinema, both as a critic and as a director. His use of jump-cuts in Breathless was not unprecedented, but that film was largely responsible for its modern day usage. The metafictional elements of Breathless would also have a lasting impact on modern day cinema. Indeed, regardless of what story was played out in his movies, Jean-Luc Godard's films were largely about film itself. As a critic he wrote a good deal about montage, and in his later films he would put his theories to use. He was also a pioneer in low-budget cinema. Breathless was shot on a shoe-string budget. Jean-Luc Godard's most lasting legacy may be the fact that he was one of the earliest filmmakers to belong to the film movement known as La Nouvelle Vauge--the French New Wave. The French New Wave would have an impact on the British New Wave and kitchen sink realism, the Japanese New Wave, the Indian New Wave, and yet other film movements around the world. Jean-Luc Godard himself would have an influence on such diverse filmmakers as Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, Brian De Palma, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, and Quentin Tarantino. Jean-Luc Godard created such legendary films as Breathless, Band of Outsiders, and Alphaville, and in doing so changed cinema forever."},

In the late Forties she appeared on the TV shows The Ford Theatre Hour, The Silver Theatre, Studio One, Danger, and Sure as Fate. In 1948 she made her Broadway debut in Joy to the World. In 1950 she appeared on Broadway in The Devil's Disciple, Borned in Texas, and Legend of Sarah.It was in 1947 that she and her husband Robert Presnell Jr. joined the Committee for the First Amendment, a group formed to challenge the legality of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), then trying to uncover Communist activity in Hollywood. The group also included such members as Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Danny Kaye, and John Huston. It was on October 19 1947 that members of the Committee for the First Amendment flew to Washington, DC to protest the HUAC hearings. While other members of the Committee for the First Amendment would recant, Marsha Hunt would not.  As a result she was listed in Red Channels,a radical right wing pamphlet that named 151 actors, directors, musicians, and so on who were alleged to be Communists or Communist sympathizers. Marsha Hunt then found herself blacklisted.Increasingly, Marsha Hunt's career would be on television and on stage. In 1959 she was a regular on the sitcom Peck's Bad Girl. She guest starred on the TV shows Cosmopolitan Theatre, The Ford Television Theatre, The 20th Century Fox Hour, The O. Henry Playhouse, Panic!, Matinee Theatre, Climax!, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Laramie, Grand Jury, The Detectives, and Zane Grey Theatre.

In the mid-Forties she was known as \"Hollywood's Youngest Character Actress.\" While other actresses often played the same sort of roles multiple times, Marsha Hunt played a wide variety of roles. No two roles were ever really the same. In Pride and Prejudice she played the bookish, dowdy Bennet sister Mary. In Raw Deal Marsha Hunt played caseworker Ann Martin, who finds herself hostage to escaped convict Joe Sullivan (Dennis O'Keefe). In the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode \"Tea Time,\" she played Blanche, a woman having an affair with a married man. In \"The Grand Inquisitor,\" Marsha Hunt played the widow of a possible serial killer in one of the most chilling performances of her life.Marsha Hunt was a remarkable woman beyond being a talented actress. She was certainly brave, continuing to take a stand against HUAC even though it was detrimental to her career. She also devoted herself to humanitarian causes long before it was fashionable to do so. Over the years Marsha Hunt appeared at various film festivals, and she was a familiar face to Turner Classic Movies fans. I have plenty of friends who had the chance to meet her, and every one of them have said she was one of the warmest, nicest people one could hope to meet. She was articulate, thoughtful, and she truly loved her fans. Marsha Hunt had strength of character that few have, and she treated everyone with dignity. She was not simply a great actress. She was a great woman."},
{"title": "My Beloved Cat Malcolm", "date": "Tuesday, September 6, 2022", "text": "This week has not been easy for me. It was late Saturday night/early Sunday morning, September 4 2022, that my cat Malcolm died. I miss him terribly and I have been crying on and off the past few days.It was on a hot day in early August many years ago when my brother and I were sitting on the porch that a kitten came running up to us, going, \"Meow.\" He couldn't have been much more than three months old. We gave him some food and water, and while he was a bit standoffish at first, he quickly warmed to us. After failing to find any humans who would claim him, we adopted the kitten and named him \"Malcolm Reynolds,\" after the character on  the TV series Firefly. Our other cats accepted Malcolm with no problem and it was not long before he became part of the family. Malcolm also quickly became my cat.Malcolm may have been the most loving cat I ever had. He was certainly attached to me. He would sit on me when I was working on the computer or watching television. He would sleep with me in my bed at night. He loved being petted. He was also our only cat who loved being hugged. Malcolm would always come running if he saw either my sister or me with his comb, as he loved being groomed. Malcolm was also very sensitive to my moods and would always come to me if I was feeling sad or if I was sick. If I had the flu and I was having chills, he would curl up beside me to keep me warm. When my dearest Vanessa Marquez died, he would not leave my side, cuddling with me even as I was crying nonstop. I am not sure how, but Malcolm seemed to realize who Vanessa was and how important she was to me. She spoke to him on the phone once and afterwards he would pay attention if I was watching one of her movies or TV shows. Somehow he connected her voice to her appearance. When after her death I set up an ofrenda for Vanessa for Día de Muertos, he would jump on the ofrenda, somehow without disturbing anything, and kiss her picture. Malcolm's behaviour with regards to Vanessa was a bit odd, as he was generally scared of other people. It took him a long time before he would let my niece and my grandniece pet him. If someone strange to him, such as our plumber, entered the house, he would run and hide under my bed until they were gone. Particularly when he was young, Malcolm could be neurotic. He was still a kitten when for some odd reason he developed a phobia of my tennis shoes. I had to sprinkle them with cat nip before he would go near them. Malcolm absolutely hated loud noises, and he would hide for a time after the garbage truck picked up our trash. He loathed the 4th of July and would spend much of the day hiding in my room.While Malcolm could be neurotic, he was not a coward by any means. He would gladly chase other cats and even small dogs from our yard, He wasn't afraid of wild animals either. Malcolm was also intelligent. He understood what the words \"food,\" \"treat,\" and \"comb\" all meant. He recognised the names of the other cats, as well as the members of the family. We had to start hiding his treats because he figured out how to open the bag without ripping it open. Among the many words Malcolm knew was \"chicken,\" probably because it was his favourite food. He loved chicken so much he would actually try to steal it from us any time we had it for dinner. As I said earlier, Malcolm was very attached to me. He would spend a good part of his day sitting on me and slept with me at night. He would miss me if I was gone for an extended period of time. He was always there waiting for me when I arrived home. As I mentioned earlier, he was always there to comfort me if I was sick or if I was sad. Malcolm was a great companion and I have no doubt that he loved me as much as I loved him.The past few days have been hard on me. I keep expecting him to be somewhere around the house. Every time I go into my bedroom I expect to see him on my bed. Right now I want nothing more than to be able to hold him again and tell him that he is my \"baby.\" There are some people who might think, \"He was only a cat,\" but I can guarantee no one who has ever had a pet will say that. Pets, regardless of their species, become part of our families. In fact, I daresay many people love their pets more than some of their biological relatives. They love us unconditionally. They don't care if we are good looking or if we have money. All they ask is that we love them in return, take care of them, and treat them well. Malcolm was certainly part of our family. I loved him more than I do most human beings and he certainly loved me back. In fact, in the past ten years there is only one individual I have mourned more than Malcolm, and that was Vanessa. Malcolm saw me through some of my darkest days. He was always there for me. I know that I will miss him for the rest of my life."},

{"title": "The Lasting Influence of Vanessa Marquez", "date": "Tuesday, August 30, 2022", "text": "It was four years ago today that Vanessa Marquez was shot in the back and killed by officers of the South Pasadena Police Department. Vanessa Marquez was a beautiful, well-known and beloved actress. She starred in such movies as Stand and Deliver (1988) and Twenty Bucks (1993). She was a regular on the TV shows Culture Clash and ER. She appeared on such TV shows as Wiseguy, Seinfeld, Nurses, and Melrose Place. Vanessa was also my dearest friend. We first encountered each other live tweeting to movies on Turner Classic Movies using the hashtag TCMParty and live tweeting episodes of the TV show Mad Men. We soon learned that we had a good deal in common and we became close friends. Eventually we were in touch nearly every day, through social media, texts, and phone calls. Vanessa made an enormous difference in my life and I miss her to this day. Four years later, I am still grieving over her.Of course, I am hardly the only person upon whom Vanessa Marquez had an impact, and her influence on people went well beyond her circle of friends. As an actress Vanessa Marquez was something of a pioneer. In the late Eighties and early Nineties, Latinas, particularly Chicanas, were rarely seen in movies and on television. When they did appear, the characters they played were often stereotypes. Vanessa Marquez did not play stereotypes. She did not play cholas or overly sexualized, fiery señoritas. When she died, her friend production designer Edward E. Haynes, who worked on the TV show Culture Clash, summed up the sort of characters she played, \"In the world where there was such little representation for people of colour, she always represented the strong, educated, and centred Latina character.\"Out of all the characters Vanessa played, perhaps no character better represented the intelligent and educated Latina than Ana Delgado in Stand and Deliver. In the film Ana Delgado is a restaurateur's daughter who not only excels in mathematics, but wants to major in medicine, despite her father's desire for her to go to work in the family restaurant. Soft spoken and shy, Ana was nonetheless intelligent and strong willed. She was a sharp break from earlier portrayals of Latinas on screen. Vanessa excelled in playing Ana, making the fact that it was her very first acting job all the more surprising. Here it must be pointed out that while the other students in the film were composites of the various students Jaime Escalante had taught through the years, Ana Delgado was the one character based on an actual person. She was based on  Leticia Rodriguez, the daughter of the owner of the restaurant El Farolito. While in the movie Ana wanted to go into medicine, in real life Leticia Rodriguez became an electrical engineer for Honeywell Corp.While Ana Delgado is among the best known characters Vanessa Marquez ever played, she was not the only intelligent, educated Latina that she played. Vanessa was also well known for having played Nurse Wendy Goldman on the hit TV show ER. While Wendy's name sounds Jewish, the character was obviously a Latina, and was often called upon to translate for Spanish speakers. Wendy may be best known for her various humorous subplots in episodes of ER, but she was also portrayed as both intelligent and competent. In the episode \"Luck of the Draw,\" when Dr. Lewis tells Wendy to give her patient 350 milligrams of dopamine, Wendy corrects her and says, \"I think you mean micrograms.\" Even before her stint as Wendy on ER, Vanessa regularly portrayed intelligent and educated characters on sketches on the show Culture Clash. Most notably, she played an exceptionally bright character in a parody of the game show Jeopardy. Vanessa's credits following ER are few, but among them is her role in the BET television movie Fire & Ice. In the TV movie, Vanessa Marquez plays Wanda Hernandez, a technician working for a security film run by Holly Ames (Lark Voorhies) and Pam Moore (Tempest Bledsoe). The educated characters played by Vanessa would have an impact, particularly Ana Delgado. Over the years she would receive fan mail from individuals who had gone into mathematics or the sciences because they had been inspired by the character of Ana Delgado. Since Vanessa's death, I have also received messages from individuals who told me how Vanessa's characters had inspired them. Indeed, if Vanessa Marquez has a legion of fans, I think it is because she played strong, fully developed characters who were not stereotypes. I think that is why the petition, launched by her Stand and Deliver co-star Lydia Nicole, to include Vanessa in the Oscars' on-air In Memoriam reached 12, 000 signatures. People loved Vanessa and appreciated her for the characters she played. Of course, Vanessa Marquez's impact went beyond her acting career. When she was younger, before she was diagnosed with refractory coeliac disease, she was busy as an activist. She worked with the United Farm Workers, and knew both Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. She did publicity for the UFW, and on December 7 1989, she took part in a rally and then a march protesting the exposure of farmers to pesticides used on grapes. She also did work on behalf of Amnesty International. Vanessa was one of the famous Latinas who appeared in the award winning 1994 Latina Vote public service announcement, directed by Julie Carmen, encouraging Latinas to vote. Later in her life, she volunteered at her local animal shelter. Vanessa was also relentless in raising money for cancer treatment for Jamie Escalante, the teacher who had inspired the movie Stand and Deliver. She was even interviewed by various Los Angeles news outlets in this capacity.Quite simply, Vanessa cared for people, and that was made even more obvious in the way she treated her friends and acquaintances. Alongside myself, Vanessa was one of the original members of TCMParty, the loose affiliation of Turner Classic Movies fans who live tweet movies on the channel using that hashtag. Vanessa was so loved by her fellow TCM fans that TCMParty co-founder Paula Guthat called her, \"the Sweetheart of #TCMParty.\" Vanessa became very close friends with many members of TCMParty. I was not the only one by any means. She was known in TCMParty for her kindness and her compassion for her fellow fans. She could recall tweets that TCMParty members had made long after they had made them. TCMParty paid tribute to Vanessa when she died. When TCM showed Stand and Deliver on September 30 2020 and again on February 4 this year, a  great amount of love was expressed for Vanessa Marquez. Edward James Olmos may have received top billing, but as far TCMParty was concerned, it was Vanessa who was the star. As an actress Vanessa Marquez was extremely talented. She could bring to life characters in a way few actors could. Very bright herself, Vanessa had no problem playing such characters as Ana Delgado and Nurse Wendy Goldman. Acutely aware of the lack of Latino representation in the media and aware of her responsibility to her fellow Mexican Americans, Vanessa refused to play stereotypes. It was because of this she would have a lasting influence as an actress. As a human being, Vanessa was sweet, warm, and loving. She cared about her fellow human beings and she sought to make a difference, whether it was through her work with the United Farm Workers or volunteering at an animal shelter. Vanessa treated her friends and even acquaintances with kindness and dignity. She was so down to earth that one would never know she was a famous actress who starred in a classic film and the number one TV show of its time. Her death sent shock waves through the TCM fan community and many TCMParty members paid tribute to her. When Turner Classic Movies aired Stand and Deliver on September 30 2020 and on February 4 this year, there may well have been more of an outpouring of love for Vanessa than many better known stars. Vanessa was a beautiful and extremely talented actress, but more importantly she was a loving and caring woman who made a difference in her friends and acquaintances' lives. It is for that many will always remember her."},

The Golden Age of Radio was roughly concurrent with the Golden Age of Hollywood. And there was a good deal of crossover between the media of radio and film. Radio show stars, such as George Burns, Gracie Allen, and Jack Benny appeared in movies. Movie stars, such as Agnes Moorehead and Lionel Barrymore, starred on radio shows. Such radio shows as Lux Radio Theatre, adapted movies as radio plays. In turn, such movies as The Great Gildersleeve (1942) and A Date with Judy (1948), were based on radio shows. It should then come as no surprise that TCM Spotlight is on radio next month on Turner Classic Movies, with movies dealing with radio in some way shape or form airing each Monday.TCM Spotlight: Radio Days deals with a wide array of movies. Some, such as The Big Broadcast of 1937 (1936) features radio show stars. Others, such as The Crime Doctor (1943) and I Love a Mystery (1945), are based on radio shows. Radio plays a prominent role in yet other movies being shown during TCM Spotlight: Radio Days, such as A Christmas Story (1983) and The Hucksters (1947).My own picks for the movies showing next month include all of the films airing on September 12, all of which are based on radio shows. Among my other picks are You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939), The Road to Singapore (1940), and I Dood It (1943), all of which air on September 5. On September 19 I suggest viewers check out the classics A Christmas Story and A Face in the Crowd (1957). On September 26, The Great Man is worth watching for its historical interest alone (it was inspired by Arthur Godfrey). For the same reason, viewers might want to check out American Hot Wax (1978), based on the life of deejay Alan Freed.Below is the schedule for TCM Spotlight: Radio Days.

He had seen a movie starring Richard Widmark in which Mr. Widmark chewed a lot of gum, and he thought that if he chewed enough gum he would emerge from the boat a full-fledged American. The theme of The Idea of America is how various immigrants' images of the United States were shaped by the movies they saw while they were young. The Idea of America airs on Friday, September 9 2022 on TCM and the following two Fridays.For each movie host Ben Mankiewicz is joined by someone who immigrated to the United States, each of who will discuss a particular movie and how it shaped their idea of the country before they immigrated, and how that image compares to the reality they have experienced since they immigrated.

{"title": "Noir Alley Returns in September 2022", "date": "Thursday, August 25, 2022", "text": "Like most Turner Classic Movies fans, I love Summer Under the Stars. The only drawback to Summer Under the Stars is that Noir Alley is pre-empted for the entirety of the month of August. Fortunately, it returns in September, so fans can once more enter the shadows to enjoy their Saturday night or Sunday morning dose of film noir.Noir Alley returns on September 3 2022 with Hit and Run (1957), which features Cleo Moore in her final film appearance and Vince Edward, who would play Ben Casey in the TV show of the same name in a few years. Hit and Run centres on an older man (Hugo Haas) who marry a younger showgirl with disastrous results.On September 10 2022 Obsession (1949) airs on Noir Alley. It is a British thriller in which a well-to-do psychiatrist (Robert Newton) decides to kill his cheating wife. It was the first of two films directed by Edward Dmytryk in the United Kingdom after he had been cited for contempt of Congress (along with the rest of the Hollywood Ten) for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee.The Naked Street (1955) airs on September 17 2022 (1955). The film stars Farley Granger as Nicky, a young man saved from the electric chair by his pregnant girlfriend's racketeer brother. In addition to Farley Granger, the movie also stars Anthony Quinn, Anne Bancroft, and Peter Graves.On September 24 2022 Noir Alley will be showing I Love Trouble (1948). I Love Trouble is based on the novel The Double Take by Roy Huggins, which would also provide the inspiration for the classic TV show 77 Sunset Strip. In the film Franchot Tone plays detective Stuart Bailey (played by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. on 77 Sunset Strip), who his hired to find the missing wife of a prominent politician. Anyway, as much as I love Summer Under the Stars, I think I can safely speak for all Noir Alley fans when I say we are eager for its return."},

Her family moved to Portland, Oregon when she was still a baby. Her uncle was General George S. Patton. She graduated from Jefferson High School in Portland and then attended the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles.Virginia Patton made her film debut in an uncredited, bit part in Thank Your Lucky Stars in 1943. In the next few years she appeared in the films Old Acquaintance (1943), Janie (1944), The Last Ride (1944), Hollywood Canteen (1944), The Horn Blows at Midnight (1945), and Canyon Passage (1946). While at USC she appeared in a play directed by William C. DeMille, the brother of director Cecil B. DeMille. Miss Patton read for Frank Capra when she was casting It's a Wonderful Life. He cast her in the role of Rath Dakin Bailey, the new bride of Harry Bailey (Todd Karns), the brother of protagonist George Bailey (James Stewart), and signed her to a contract. She was the last surviving adult cast member of the film (only some of the child actors remain). After appearing in It's a Wonderful Life, Virginia Patton would only appear in a few more movies.

Virginia Patton was a wonderful actress."},
{"title": "Luis Guzmán Is Ideal as Gomez Addams", "date": "Monday, August 22, 2022", "text": "A few days ago the first photos from the upcoming streaming TV series Wednesday, based on Charles Addams's classic single panel cartoon The Addams Family were released. Almost immediately on social media sites there were unfavourable comparisons of Luis Guzmán as Gomez Addams to John Astin (in the classic TV show) and Raul Julia (in the feature films of the Nineties). Fortunately, a number of Addams Family fans defended Mr. Guzmán. I am one of those people who is very happy with him being cast as Gomez.As portrayed in Charles Addams's cartoons, Gomez Addams was short, squat, and not conventionally handsome. Even after the classic TV series debuted in 1964, in the cartoons Gomez continued to be short and squat. Of course, this was a sharp contrast to the TV series, on which Gomez as portrayed by John Astin was above average in height, slender, and handsome. Here it must be pointed out that, despite the success of the TV series, Gomez's appearance was not changed in Charles Addams's cartoons. He remained short and tubby and not what one would usually consider handsome.The movies of the Nineties (The Addams Family and Addams Family Values) would follow the TV show's example in the casting of Gomez. Raul Julia was tall, slender, and handsome. While both John Astin and Raul Julia did superb jobs of playing Gomez--he remains an iconic character with good reason, their appearances did differ from Gomez as portrayed in Charles Addams's cartoons.Now I can understand why those familiar with only the TV show or the movies might not be pleased with the casting of Luis Guzmán as Gomez. That having been said, for those of us who are huge fans of the cartoons, his casting is ideal. The fact is that Luis Guzmán looks much more like Gomez in the cartoons than either John Astin or Raul Julia. He is below average in height. He has a stout build. And  I personally think Mr. Guzmán's face looks much more like Gomez as he was portrayed in the cartoons. Miles Millar, co-creator of the TV series Wednesday, has said of the show, \"It's not trying to be the movies or the '60s TV show.\" Given this, it makes perfect sense that they would cast as actor who looks more like Gomez in Charles Addams's original cartoons. As for myself, I have always admired Mr. Guzmán's work and I think he will do a fantastic job as Gomez Addams. I honestly don't think they could have cast the role any better."},
{"title": "Hop Harrigan on the Radio", "date": "Saturday, August 20, 2022", "text": "In the Thirties heroic aviators became a hot commodity, with such comic strips as The Adventures of Smilin' Jack and such pulp magazines as G8 and His Battle Aces. In 1939 Action Comics no. 1  (June 1938) introduced the world to Superman and suddenly the young medium of comic books were a big business. The character of Hop Harrigan was both a heroic aviator and a comic book hero. With his best friend Tank Tinker and an heiress named Gerry, Hop Harrigan founded the All-American Aviation Company, which led he and Tank on an number of adventures.Hop Harrigan first appeared in All-American Comics no. 1 (April 1939). It was the first comic book published by  All-American Publications. It was  a sister of company to two other related companies, National Allied Publications and Detective Comics, Inc. Even in the Golden Age the three companeis would be referred to colloquially and collectively as \"DC Comics,\" as all three bore the \"DC bullet\" on their titles. The three companies would promote each other's titles in their own, and their characters would even appear together. Indeed, they are the companies that by 1946 would comprise the modern day DC Comics (initially called National Comics Publications and later National Periodical Publications until at last being formally named DC Comics). Hop Harrigan was created by Jon L. Blummer, who worked on such characters as Ultra-Man, Captain X of the RAF, and Little Boy Blue for DC, and created the superhero Fighting Yank for the comic book publisher Nedor. While Hop Harrigan never earned his own title like other All-American stalwarts like The Flash, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman, he was a popular character nonetheless. He appeared as a backup feature not only in All-American Comics, but also such titles as All-Flash, All-Star Comics, Comic Cavalcade, and Green Lantern. It should have surprised no one, at least those savvy to comic book characters, when Hop Harrigan received his own radio show in 1942.Hop Harrigan debuted on August 31 1942 on Blue Network (which would become the American Broadcasting Company during the run of the radio show).  It starred Chester Stratton as Hop Harrigan. Mr. Stratton was also the lead on the radio show The O'Neills and appeared on the radio serial Pepper Young's Family, as well as making appearances on Broadway and in movies. Tank Tyler was played by Jackson Beck, already familiar to DC Comics fans as the narrator on The Adventures of Superman, as well as the voice of Bluto in Paramount's \"Popeye\" cartoons. Hop's girlfriend Gail Nolan was played by Mitzi Gould, who also appeared on such radio shows as Into the Light and Life Can Be Beautiful. Eventually Albert Aley, who was also one of the writers on the show, would take over the role of Hop Harrigan. The announcer on the show was Glenn Riggs, who also served as the announcer on several other shows, including The Adventures of Jungle Jim, Boston Blackie, Ethel and Albert, and Vic and Sade. He served as Bing Crosby's announcer for years.Much of Hop Harrigan was written by Bob Burtt and Wilfred Moore. The two had created the hit radio show Captain Midnight, so it should come as no surprise that Hop Harrigan resembled that show to a large degree. As mentioned earlier, Albert Aley was also one of the writers. Many radio shows had fan clubs that fans could join. Hop Harrigan had no less than two: the All-American Flying Club and the American Observers Corps. Both groups had their own pins and other related merchandise. As a mark of the popularity of Hop Harrigan, in the show's second month on the air it received 124,264 letters from people wanting premiums offered on the show. In the mid-Forties Grape Nut Flakes was the show's sponsor. Hop Harrigan lasted on ABC until August 2 1946. It moved to the Mutual Broadcasting Company, where it debuted on October 2 1946. There it lasted until February 6 1948.  By the mid to late Forties aviator heroes were not as popular as they had once been, and it seems quite possible that because of that the character of Hop Harrigan had declined in popularity. Indeed, despite having his own radio show and a 1946 movie serial, Hop Harrigan last appeared in All-American Comics no. 99 (July 1948). Sadly, he has not been seen in DC Comics very much since.While Hop Harrigan's radio show ended in 1948 and he stopped appearing regularly in comic books that same year, he is not forgotten. Several (perhaps all) of the episodes of Hop Harrigan survived and they are available on both Old Time Radio sites and YouTube. Hop Harrigan may not be the best known All-American Comics character these days, but for a time he had a bigger impact in media beyond comic books."},

With brothers Brian and Eddie Holland he was one third of the songwriting and production team Holland-Dozier-Holland. Together they wrote such hits as \"Heat Wave\" by Martha and The Vandellas, \"Baby Love\" by The Supremes, \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\" by Marvin Gaye, \"It's the Same Old Song\" by The Four Tops, and many others.Lamont Dozier was born on June 16 1941 in Detroit, Michigan. It was a teacher in elementary school who encouraged him in his writing. By the time he was 12 or 13, he would be setting his words to music. He was 15 when he formed the doo-wop group The Romeos. The Romeos would record two singles, \"\"Gone, Gone, Get Away\" and \"Moments to Remember You By.\" After The Romeos disbanded, Lamont Dozier auditioned for the new label, Anna Records. At the label, he became part of the group The Voice Masters. The Voice Masters released a total of five singles from 1957 to 1961. It was in 1961, using the name Lamont Anthony, he released his first solo single. The A-side was \"Let's Talk It Over,\" but the label preferred the B-side, \"Popeye.\" \"Popeye\" was subsequently withdrawn due to objections from King Features, the copyright holders of the character Popeye. It was re-recorded as \"Benny the Skinny Man.\" In 1961 he released one last single under the name Lamont Anthony, this one under the Checkmate label. It was \"Just to Be Loved.\"It was also in 1961 that Lamont Dozier received a job offer from Barry Gordy, Jr., to work for his new label Motown. He would receive a salary of $25 a week against royalties. Lamont Dozier began working with another young songwriter, Brian Holland. Brian's older brother, Eddie Holland, soon joined them. Together Holland-Dozier-Holland would write many of Motown's biggest hits, composing songs for such artists as The Marvelettes, The Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Mary Wells, Martha and The Vandellas, and The Four Tops.Dozier-Holland-Dozier left Motown in 1967 after a dispute over royalties and profit-sharing with Barry Gordy. They went onto start their own labels, Invictus and Hot Wax. It was in 1973 that Lamont Dozier left the team and resumed his singing career. In 1973 he released his debut solo album, Out Here On My Own. He released the single \"Trying to Hold on to My Woman,\" which went to no. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. From 1974 to 2018 he would release eleven more albums. He would also co-write songs with such songwriters as Eric Clapton, Mike Hucknall of Simply Red, and Phil Collins. He also wrote songs for such artists Alison Moyet, Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle, Debbie Gibson, and Joss Stone.Along with his partners, Brian and Eddie Holland, there can be no doubt that Lamont Dozier was one of the greatest songwriters of all time. Arguably, it was as much songwriters Holland-Dozier-Holland who were responsible for the success of Motown as it was the label's various artists. Some important was the songwriting and production team to Motown that in 1986 Mary Wilson of The Supremes told The Washington Post, \"Holland-Dozier-Holland left and the sound was gone.\" Few songwriters could ever match the success of Lamont Dozier."},
{"title": "Godspeed Olivia Newton-John", "date": "Saturday, August 13, 2022", "text": "Olivia Newton-John, who had a string of hit songs from the Seventies into the Eighties and starred in the movies Grease (1978) and Xanadu (1980), died on August 8 2022 at the age of 73. The cause was cancer.Olivia Newton-John was born on September 26 1948 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire. She was six years old when her family immigrated to Australia. She attended Christ Church Grammar School in South Yarra, Victoria and  the University High School in Parkville, Victoria. Olivia Newton-John was only 14 when she and three classmates formed the all-girl group Sol Four. She was still a teenager when she became a regular on the Australian television shows Time for Terry and The Happy Show. She was also a regular on The Go!! Show. Miss Newton-John won a talent contest on the Australian show Sing! Sing! Sing!. In 1965 she appeared in the movie A Funny Thing Happened Down Under. It was in 1966 that Decca Records released her first single, \"\"Till You Say You'll Be Mine.\"Olivia Newton-John became part of the music group Toomorrow, formed for the movie for the same name, released in 1970. The film received poor distribution and produced no hits from its soundtrack. Fortunately for Miss Newton-John, her first album, If Not for You, was released in 1971. The first single from the album, \"If Not for You,\" proved to be a hit, going to no. 1 in Australia, no. 7 in the United Kingdom, and no. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Her third album, Let Me Be There, would produce another hit. In 1973 \"Let Me Be There\" went to no. 2 in Canada and no. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. It would be followed by even bigger hits, \"I Honestly Love You\" and \"Have You Ever Been Mellow,\" in 1974 and 1975 respectively. This began a string of hits that would last for the next few years.Olivia Newton-John's career would become even more successful following the release of the movie Grease. Her singles regularly reached the top forty of the Billboard Hot 100 until the mid-Eighties. She continued to record throughout the Nineties, Naughts, and Teens. She ultimately released 26 albums throughout her career. Of course, Olivia Newton-John also had a career in film and on television. It was after appearing in A Funny Thing Happened Down Under (1965) and Toomorrow (1970) that Olivia Newton-John appeared in Grease (1978). The movie proved to be very successful, as did its soundtrack. She followed Grease with Xanadu (1980. Xanadu did not do particularly well at the box office and received negative reviews, but the soundtrack (half of which were by the Electric Light Orchestra and half of which were by Olivia Newton-John). She starred in the movie Two of a Kind(1983). Like Xanadu, the film failed at the box office and received negative reviews, but the soundtrack performed very well on the charts. Miss Newton-John would later appear in the feature films She's Having a Baby (1988), It's My Party (1996), Sordid Lives (2000), Score: A Hockey Musical (2010), A Few Best Men (2011), and The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee (2020). On television Miss Newton-John appeared in the TV movies A Mom for Christmas, A Christmas Romance, The Christmas Story: A Story on Ice, The Wilde Girls, and Sharknado 5: Global Swarming. She guest starred on the shows Snowy River: The McGregor Saga, Ned and Stacey, Murphy Brown, and Bette. She was a regular on the show Sordid Lives: The Series.As a kid I had a crush on Olivia Newton-John, even if I didn't  necessarily like all of her music. Of course, I am probably not the only person who had a crush on Olivia Newton-John as a kid, and I know she has a legion of fans who love her songs and some of her movies. Olivia Newton-John certainly had a beautiful voice. She also had the ability to literally light up the screen, regardless of the quality of the material in which she appeared. Quite simply, she was a great performer. The whole reason I still have a soft spot for Xanadu is that in the various musical sequences Miss Newton-John is simply incredible. I think if she had been born a few decades earlier, she would have been a major musical star.Of course, Olivia Newton-John was more than a singer and actress. She was also a humanitarian. From a young age she advocated for animal rights. She was also an environmental activist. She founded the Olivia Newton-John Fund for cancer research. The world was a better place for Olivia Newton-John having been in it."},
{"title": "Godspeed Judith Durham", "date": "Friday, August 12, 2022", "text": "Judith Durham, the lead singer with The Seekers from 1963 to 1968 who went onto a successful solo career, died on August 5 2022 at the age of 79. The cause was bronchiectasis, which she had most of her life.Judith Durham was born on July 3 1943 in Essendon, Victoria, Australia. She spent the first several years of her life in Essendon before her father moved to Taroona, Tasmania, a suburb of Hobart, Tasmania. She attended the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and received an Associate in Music in classical piano at the University of Melbourne Conservatorium. Originally planning to be a a pianist, her singing career began when she asked the Melbourne University Jazz Band's conductor, Nicholas Ribush, if she could sing with the band at the Memphis Jazz Club in Malvern. In 1963 she started performing at the Memphis Jazz Club in Malvern with Frank Traynor's Jazz Preachers. That same year her first, self-titled EP was released on W&G Records Judith Durham joined The Seekers as their new lead vocalist after their original lead singer, Keith Ray, left to get married. It was because of Miss Durham's ties to W&G Records that The Seekers signed with the label in in 1963. Their debut album Introducing The Seekers, was released that same year. Their first single was a cover of the Australian bush ballad \"Waltzing Mathilda.\" It peaked at no. 74 on the Australian singles chart. It was in 1964 that The Seekers travelled to the United Kingdom, with the intent of staying their only ten weeks. As it turned out,they were offered work by the Grade Organization and the ten weeks turned into an extended stay. They eventually met Tom Springfield, brother of Dusty Springfield, who wrote \"I'll Never Find Another You\" for the group. It proved to be their first major hit, going to number 1 in Australia, number 1 in the United Kingdom, and number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"I'll Never Find Another You\" would be followed by several more hits, including \"\"A World of Our Own,\" \"The Carnival is Over,\" \"Someday, One Day,\" \"Morningtown Ride,\" \"Georgy Girl,\" and \"When Will the Good Apples Fall.\" Judith Durham left The Seekers in 1968 to pursue a solo career. Over the years she released several solo albums. She also played the role of Sarah Simmons in the Australian Seventies television show Cash & Company.Judith Durham had one of the most beautiful voices of her era. Elton John himself once described her as having \"the purest voice in popular music.\" She had an incredible soprano that placed The Seekers' songs and her own solo work well above the songs of many of their contemporaries. With The Seekers, Judith Durham was a pioneer among Australian music artists, becoming among the first to have international hits. She also influenced Australian music artists to come, including Olivia Newton-John (who, sadly, died only three days after Miss Durham). Judith Durham was an incredible singer and her songs will still be played for many years to come."},

Clu Gulager was born William Martin Gulager on November 16 1928 in Holdenville, Oklahoma. His father, John had been an actor on Broadway before practising law in Muskogee, Oklahoma. His mother, Hazel, worked for the Veteran's Administration. His father gave him the nickname \"Clu\" after the martins or clu-clu birds that nested around their home. Clu Gulager was Cherokee and a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. He as also related to Will Rogers through his paternal grandmother, who was the sister of Will Rogers's mother. This made Clu Gulager and Will Rogers first cousins, once removed.  Clu Gulager was a genuine cowboy when he was young. In an interview with Tulsa World from 2019, he said, \"I was a cowboy from Oklahoma. I rode the fences [around cattle] in the winter, and in the summer, I was out in the field, watching out for rattlesnakes.\" He also played the French horn. After graduating high school, Clu Gulager served in the United States Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton. He attended Northeastern State College in Tahlequah, Oklahoma and Baylor University in Waco, Texas. It was while he was at Baylor University that he received a one-year scholarship to study in Paris under French director, actor, and mime Jean Louis Barrault (perhaps best known for the classic Les Enfants du Paradis).Clu Gulager made his television debut in 1955 in an episode of Omnibus. In the late Fifties he appeared in the shows The United States Steel Hour, Goodyear Television Playhouse, Studio One, West Point, The Alcoa Hour, Black Saddle, Playhouse 90, Wanted: Dead or Alive, The Lawless Years, Have Gun--Will Travel, Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, Laramie, Law of the Plainsman, The Untouchables, Five Fingers, Riverboat, The Lineup, The Rebel, Wagon Train, The Deputy, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. In 1960 Mr. Gulager began playing a two year run as Billy the Kid on The Tall Man.In the Sixties Clu Gulager continued playing Billy the Kid on The Tall Man. In 1963 he began a five year run as Sheriff Emmett Ryker on the hit Western series The Virginian. In 1970 he starred on the series San Francisco International Airport. He guest starred on the shows The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, Wagon Train, Kraft Suspense Theatre, Dr. Kildare, The Survivors, Ironside,  and Name of the Game. He made his move debut in The Killers (1964), playing a hit man opposite Lee Marvin. He also appeared in the movies And Now Miguel (1966) and Winning (1971). In the Seventies he starred on the TV show The MacKenzies of Paradise Cove. He guest starred on the shows The Psychiatrist; The F.B.I.; Medical Center, Bonanza; The Mod Squad; The Bold Ones: The New Doctors; Mannix; The Wonderful World of Disney; Kung Fu; The Wide World of Mystery; Insight; Ironside; The New Perry Mason; Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law; Shaft; Get Christie Love!; The ABC Afternoon Play Break; McCloud; Khan!; Cannon; The Streets of San Francisco; Kate McShane; Medical Story; Three for the Road; Police Story; Phyllis; Ellery Queen; Barnaby Jones; Good Heavens; Hawaii Five-O; Most Wanted; Dog and Cat; Westside Medical; and The Oregon Trail. He also appeared on the mini-series Once an Eagle. Black Beauty, and King, as well as several TV movies. He appeared in the movies The Last Picture Show (1971), Molly and Lawless John (1972), McQ (1974), Gangsterfilmen (1974), The Drought (1975), The Other Side of Midnight (1977), A Force of One (1979), and Touched by Love (1980). In the Eighties Clu Gulager appeared in the movies Lies (1983), The Initiation (1984), Chattanooga Choo Choo (1984), Into the Night (1985), The Return of the Living Dead (1985), Prime Risk (1985), A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985), Hunter's Blood (1986), Summer Heat (1987), The Offspring (1987), The Hidden (1987), Tapeheads (1988), I'm Gonna Git Ya Sucka (1988), and Teen Vamp (1989).

Even so, Mr. Gulager played a wide variety of roles throughout this career. In The Killers he was gum chewing hired killer Lee. In the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode \"Pen Pal,\" he played an escaped convict who visits the woman who has been writing him while he was in prison. In The Last Picture Show he played Abilene, the town scoundrel and a foreman for the richest man in town as well. In the mini-series North and South, Book II Clu Gulager played Union General Philip Sheridan. Over the years Clu Gulager played everything from cowboys to medical doctors to men of the cloth to police officers. What is more, he played all of them well. Clu Gulager always gave a good performance.I never had the opportunity to meet Clu Gulager, but I have friends who were not only privileged to have met him, but to have called him a friend. Over the years Clu Gulager attended many conventions. He was also a classic movie fan, and it was not unusual to see him at various classic movie events around Los Angeles. From a piece he wrote for True West magazine I know he loved the work of Federico Fellini and his favourite movie was 8 1/2 (1963). From my friends I know that Clu Gulager behaved very much as cowboys in old Westerns are shown to act. He was polite, kind, charming, honest, and very loyal to his friends. He was also a fan of classical music and, as mentioned earlier, classic film. Clu Gulager was a true gentleman, and while he died at 93, to many of us it still seems as if he died too young."},
{"title": "Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story", "date": "Tuesday, August 9, 2022", "text": "Rightly or wrongly, there are those directors, actors, and artists fromthe Golden Age of Hollywood who are often obscure today and known onlyto devoted classic film buffs. They may have been critically acclaimedin their time. They may have even received Oscar nominations or evenOscar wins. Regardless, today their names are not recognized by thegeneral public. Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story, written and directedby Scott Fivelson, centres on a fictional example of such anindividual. Oskar Knight was a critically acclaimed director, one whoholds the record for having been nominated for the Academy Award moretimes than any other director in history. Famous in his day, OskarKnight is now only known to students of classic film.Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story brings to mind such mockumentariesas All You Need is Cash (1979) and This is Spinal Tap (1984), while atthe same time evoking such movies dealing with Old Hollywood as SunsetBoulevard (1950) and The Artist (2011). It follows Oskar Knight fromhis childhood in Germany to his early days in Hollywood to his rise tothe top of the directing profession. Near Myth: The Oskar KnightStory goes into some detail on the ups and downs of his career,including Oskar Knight's frustration at endless Oscar snubs, despitebeing nominated multiple times. The film not only touches upon hiscareer, but upon Oskar Knight's personal life as well. His days as aHollywood bon vivant, his marriage, and his son Oskar Knight, Jr.'ssubstance abuse problems are all covered in the movie.What separates Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story from similar films isjust how convincing it is. When one watches This is Spinal Tap, one isperfectly aware that Spinal Tap is a fictional creation, but when onewatches Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story, one can almost believe thereactually was a director named Oskar Knight. Much of this is due to thefact that it uses real-life Hollywood personages to discuss OskarKnight as both a director and a person. Classic film buffs willrecognize Margaret O'Brien (famous for Meet Me in St. Louis and TheSecret Garden), the late Noel Neill (forever Lois Lane from theSuperman serials and the TV series Adventures of Superman), and JonProvost (best known as Timmy on Lassie). Among the rest of the cast areother readily recognizable names, such as Kristina Anapau of the TVseries True Blood and the movie Black Swan (2010); Randall Batinkoff ofthe TV series Christy and the movie Higher Learning (1995); JulianFlynn from the movie Wasp Network (2019); Julianna Guill of the TVseries The Resident; Rudolf Martin of the movie Swordfish (2001)and Ford v. Ferrari (2019); Lawrence Pressman of the movie TheHellstrom Chronicle (1971) and the TV series Doogie Howser, M.D.; andSir David Suchet of Agatha Christie's Poirot. Not only does Near Myth:The Oskar Knight Story feature real-life Hollywood personagesdiscussing the director, but all of their performances are sincere.Even when their discussions of Oskar Knight are tinged with humour (itis, after all, a comedy), one can honestly believe Oskar Knightactually existed.Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story is made all the more convincing infeaturing photos of Hollywood legends into which Oskar has beeninserted, further giving the illusion that Oskar Knight was an actual,respected director who hobnobbed with the Hollywood elite. As if thiswasn't enough, we also get clips from his movies, fromthe screwball comedy Heaven to Betsy to his critically malignedepic Oskar Knight’s Moby Dick, not to mention Oskar's home movies andpersonal photos.Of course, at the heart of Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story is OskarKnight himself. As Oskar Knight, the great Lenny Von Dohlen doesn'thave a lot of lines, but his performance still makes the viewer feel asif they know Mr. Knight. Lenny Von Dohlen was such a talent that hecould relay the thoughts and feelings of his characters with littlemore than his facial expressions and body language. This is no lesstrue of his performance as Oskar Knight, which stands out as one of hisbest performances in a career filled with great performances. Thefilm's other lead, Alex Bell as Oskar Knight, Jr., also gives a bravuraperformance. Oskar Knight, Jr. is the child of Hollywood one sometimeshears about, the son of a famous and acclaimed director who fallsvictim to substance abuse. As Oskar Knight, Jr., Alex Bell isresponsible for much of the humour in the film, while at the same timeinsuring Oskar Knight, Jr. remains a sympathetic figure in themovie. Lenny Von Dohlen and Alex Bell both make Near Myth: The OskarKnight Story, already a fun film to watch, all the more enjoyable.Without a doubt, Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story would not workwithout Scott Fivelson's superior script and expert direction. ScottFivelson has written a film that is at times very funny, but at thesame time treats its subject with respect and even poignancy. It isbecause Oskar Knight is so well conceived that one can be convincedthat he is real. Scott Fivelson's direction makes the best use of hisdiverse ensemble, improving upon performances that were already greatto begin with.Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story had a successful run on the filmfestival circuit. At the 2016 Hollywood Independent Film Festival ScottFivelson won the Breakthrough Director Spotlight Award. At the 2017Vancouver Filmdance Festival he won the award for Best Director. At the2016 Buffalo Niagara Film Festival, Jay Gillespie won the award forBest Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance as Young Val in thefilm. At the 2016 Garden State Film Festival, Ted Reedy won the awardfor Best Song from a Feature Documentary.Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story will be coming out later this year.It is my firm hope that it also receives a theatrical release. Afterall, it is a film about cinema, so I think it really should be seen ina cinema.Beyond everything else, Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story is a loveletter to Old Hollywood. It is a loving ode to every director, actor,or other artist who never got their due, who never won an Oscar or tooka lifetime to win one – you’ll have to see the film to find out ifOskar ever did – and today remain obscure, even though they deservedbetter. In that respect, Oskar Knight is something of an everyman, astand-in for all those great directors and actors long overlooked bythe general public. While I believe everyone will enjoy Near Myth: TheOskar Knight Story, I can see it being loved best by classic film fans,who will know all too well there is a good deal of truth to OskarKnight's story. Indeed, I think Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story could be destined to be a classic itself."},
{"title": "Some of Marilyn Monroe's Best Performances", "date": "Friday, August 5, 2022", "text": "It seems to me that it is a sad fact that while one hears a lot about Marilyn Monroe, one actually hears very little about Marilyn Monroe as an actress. Her acting talent seems to have been overshadowed largely by her tragic life and death, not to mention her status as an icon.When many people think of Marilyn Monroe what really comes to mind is a caricature of the actual Marilyn Monroe. When they think of Marilyn, they think of a blonde bombshell in a skintight dress singing, \"Happy birthday, Mr. President,\" in a soft, breathy voice. There was much more to Marilyn Monroe than her sad life and certainly more to Marilyn Monroe than the image the average person might carry in their mind. As many classic film fans know, she was an immensely talented actress who gave some great performances. Today, on the 60th anniversary of her death, I want to take the time to remember some of Marilyn Monroe's best performances. Indeed, some of Miss Monroe's best performances came early in her career. She isn't on screen for very long in All About Eve (1950), but she leaves a lasting impression in the film. Marilyn Monroe plays Claudia Casswell, an actress and the date of of an important film critic at a party. Claudia is hardly respected as an actress, as her performances are generally considered terrible. Even so, at the party Claudia displays a deadpan wit and has no difficulty charming most everyone in the room. Another one of Marilyn Monroe's early dramatic role is also one of her most disturbing. In Don't Bother to Knock, she plays Nell, a young woman with suicidal and even homicidal impulses, who exhibits some definitely disturbing behaviour. When the audience learns of Nell's past, they probably aren't surprised. Marilyn Monroe gives a bravura performance as Nell, one that makes the character sympathetic even as her she is going through a psychotic break.Another great early performance by Marilyn Monroe is perhaps better known than playing Nell in Don't Bother to Knock. In Niagara (1953) Marilyn Monroe plays Rose Loomis, a woman married to an older man who also happens to be unhappy and very, very jealous. As it turns out, Rose begins an affair with another man and the two plot her husband's death. The femme fatale may not be the first sort of role that comes to mind when one thinks of Marilyn Monroe, but she does very well playing Rose Loomis. Quite simply, Rose is about as far from Sugar Kane as one can get.Although she seems to be best known for comedies and musicals, Marilyn Monroe was particularly adept at drama. This is demonstrated by one of the films made midway through her career. In Bus Stop (1956), Miss Monroe plays Chérie, a singer at the Blue Dragon Cafe in Phoenix. Chérie  is a singer from the Ozarks with aspirations of Hollywood stardom. Unfortunately, she seems trapped in her current position, no matter how much she wants to get out of it. As Chérie, Marilyn Monroe is at her most vulnerable, and she portrays the character's sadness very well. Of course, Marilyn Monroe was adept at comedy and it is perhaps for that reason her best known roles tend to be in comedies and musicals. A prime example of Miss Monroe's talent for comedy is in the movie Monkey Business (1952). In the film she plays Lois Laurel, the secretary of Oliver Oxley (Charles Coburn) of the Oxley chemical company. Lois is generally clueless and not particularly bright, leading to much of the humour in the movie. Marilyn Monroe (who in reality was very intelligent), plays the role perfectly, without going over the top and playing the character with perfect innocence. Naturally, when it comes to comedy one cannot discuss Marilyn Monroe without mentioning How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), and Some Like It Hot (1959). In How to Marry a Millionaire she played the extremely myopic Pola, who refuses to wear her glasses when around men because she fully believes \"men aren't attentive to girls who wear glasses.\" In Gentlemen Prefer Blondes showgirl Lorelei Lee who prefers men with money, regardless of their looks. In Some Like It Hot, Miss Monroe plays Sugar Kane, the singer and a ukulele player in Sweet Sue and the Society Syncopators. I won't go in depth on these three roles as much has been written about them already, but Marilyn plays each role with a subtlety that makes them all the more funny than if she had been over the top.Marilyn Monroe's final performance would also be one of her best. In The Misfits (1961) she played Roslyn Taylor, a vulnerable, sensitive, and ultimately very sad divorcee who become involved with three cowboys. Miss Monroe plays Roslyn Taylor with a melancholy that few other actresses could pull off. Roslyn Taylor is a woman who has been defeated by life, but nonetheless survives. Given its stars (Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe) would die not long after the film's completion, The Misfits can be uncomfortable viewing.Marilyn Monroe was much more than her tragic life and death. She was also much more than the image the general public seems to have of her. She was an immensely talented actress who was capable of playing a wide variety of roles with both subtlety and vulnerability. Sugar Kane may be her best known role with good reason, but over the years she played many roles that equally memorable."},

Tom Richmond also taught at both Brooklyn College and New York University. While the movies of many cinematographers have similar looks, each one of Tom Richmond's movies had a different look. In a 1998 interview Tom Richmond explained,  \"My style is completely based on the script and the director\" and later in the interview said, \"Every director is different in their styles and in their ability to communicate. All my films look different because they're not my visions; they're my reflections of the directors' visions.\" Tom Richmond certainly had a talent for capturing the mood and feel of any given movie. On James Gray's Little Odessa he used the 2:35 aspect ratio, the widescreen aspect ratio often used by Sergio Leone. For Keenen Ivory Wayans's I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, he perfectly captured the look of the Blaxpoitation movies of the Seventies. Not only could Tom Richmond capture the perfect look for any given film, but he was a talented photographer capable of capturing beautiful images on film. Stand and Deliver begins with a moving shot of beautiful water. It is only when the camera pulls out that one realizes it is the Los Angeles River. Shots in  Slums of Beverly Hills of Los Angeles's famous palm trees are also impressive. So gifted was Tom Richmond as a cinematographer than frames in his movies also work very well as still photographs. Tom Richmond was never nominated for an Oscar, although he was nominated three times for Independent Spirit Awards (once for Stand and Deliver) and he won a Sundance Award for Right at Your Door). While he might not have received much in the way of awards or even nominations, he was still one of the best cinematographers of the late 20th and early 21st Centuries."},

She won an Emmy for her work on Caesar's Hour with good reason. As Bunny Halper, the wife of Danny's manager Charlie Halper (Sid Melton) on The Danny Thomas Show, she was easily one of the funniest characters on a show filled with funny characters. Pat Carroll enriched any show she was on, which was why she was so much in demand, appearing with such legends as Red Buttons, Mickey Rooney, Steve Allen, Red Skelton, and Charley Weaver over the years. Able to extemporize funny lines on the spot, she was very much in demand in game shows from the Fifties to the Seventies. Even in her guest appearances Pat Carroll could easily steal the show. She was hilarious as a cranky patient sharing Mary's hospital room on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. On three episodes of The Red Skelton Show she played Clara Appleby, the domineering wife of Red Skelton's perpetually henpecked character George Appleby. Of course, Pat Carroll was also a gifted voice actor, providing voices for numerous animated TV shows and movies. In animation she played a wide variety of roles, from the sweet natured Granny in My Neighour Toturo to the villainous Ursula in The Little Mermaid. Pat Carroll was a gifted performer who always improved the quality of any show or movie she was in."},

In any given year he might appear on several television shows, not to mention a movie or two. Americans of a certain age had to be familiar with much of his work as well, given how the many movies in which he appeared in the Sixties. On either side of the Pond, Bernard Cribbins was then something of a comforting figure. People (particularly my fellow Americans) might not remember his name, but they knew they would be treated to a great performance.And Bernard Cribbins gave many great performances, so many that to single out only a few, while necessary in a blog, doesn't seem fair. In The Mouse on the Moon he played the Prime Minister's son, educated in England and determined to become an astronaut.

On a memorable episode of Fawlty Towers, he played a finicky spoon salesman. One of his best remembered roles was on Doctor Who. He played Wilfrid Mott, the grandfather of The Doctor's companion Donna Noble. Wilfrid was a bit eccentric, but also brave (once he took on Daleks with a paintball gun) and devoted to those he loved. Of course, in addition to Bernard Cribbins's acting career, he also recorded novelty songs. \"The Hole in the Ground\" and \"Right Said Fred\" remain classics to this day. Bernard Cribbins was very prolific and he had a career that lasted decades. He was a talented actor with a gift for comedy, but who could also play drama very well. There can be no doubt that he will be remembered for years and years to come."},
{"title": "Hailing Frequencies Open: The Late Great Nichelle Nichols", "date": "Monday, August 1, 2022", "text": "There are those shows and those actors who have an impact on us from our earliest years. I cannot remember when I first saw Star Trek, but I know I must have been very young. That also means I have no idea when I first saw Nichelle Nichols. I simply know that I have been one of her fans as long as I can remember. The entire cast of Star Trek made a lasting impression on me and Nichelle Nichols was no different. When I was young, besides Gail Fisher on Mannix, she was the only Black actress on a drama I knew of.  What is more, Nichelle Nichols played Lt. Uhura, who as Communications Officer and fifth in command of the starship Enterprise occupied a position of authority. Miss Nichols could not help but make an impression on me. What is more, Nichelle Nichols impressed me beyond being a talented actress, singer, and dancer. She worked with NASA to recruit minorities and women in the space program. In the Eighties she served  on the board of governors of the National Space Institute. To put it simply, Nichelle Nichols was one of my heroes. Sadly, Nichelle Nichols died July 30 2022 at the age of 89.Nichelle Nichols was born Grace Dell Nichols on December 28 1932 in Robbins, Illinois. She adopted the name \"Nichelle\" when she was a teenager. Her father, Samuel Nichols, was mayor and chief magistrate of Robbins. It is the second oldest  Black incorporated town in northern Illinois after Brooklyn, Illinois. Nichelle Nichols studied both ballet and Afro-Cuban dancing. It was while she was performing in a revue at the Sherman House hotel in Chicago that she was discovered by Duke Ellington. She toured with Duke Ellington and his band throughout the United States and later performed with Lionel Hampton's orchestra. In the Fifties, she performed in nightclubs in both the United States and Canada. She even opened for Redd Foxx.Nichelle Nichols made her film debut in 1959, dancing in Porgy and Bess. In 1961 she appeared in the stage musical Kicks and Co. in New York City and later Chicago. She performed at the Chicago Playboy Club and also appeared in a Chicago stock company production of Carmen Jones. She later performed in a New York production of Porgy and Bess. In 1964 Nichelle Nichols made her television debut in the TV movie Great Gettin' Up in the Mornin'. That same year she guest starred on Gene Roddenberry's television series The Lieutenant and The CBS Repertoire Workshop. In 1966 she guest starred in two episodes of Peyton Place. It was in 1966 that she began her three year run as Lt. Nyota Uhura on Star Trek. While the show did not receive particularly good ratings, it developed a cult following even in its first run. It was while she was on Star Trek that Nichelle Nichols guest starred on the TV series Tarzan. In 1970 she guest starred on Insight. In the Sixties Nichelle Nichols appeared in the movies Made in Paris (1966), Mister Buddwing (1966), and Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding! (1967).In the Seventies Nichelle Nichols reprised her role as Uhura in Star Trek: The Animated Series and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). She guest starred on the TV show The D.A. She appeared in the movie Truck Turner (1974). In 1976 she was a  a special guest at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, watching the landing of Viking 1 on Mars. That same year she attended the  christening of the Space Shuttle Enterprise with other Star Trek cast members. Beginning in 1977 Nichelle Nichols began her affiliation with NASA through her company Women in Motion to recruit more minorities and women into the space program. In the Eighties Nichelle Nichols continued to appear as Uhura in the Star Trek movies, including Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984), Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986), and Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989). She also appeared in the movie The Supernaturals (1986). She guest starred on the show Head of the Class and appeared in the TV movie Antony and Cleopatra. As mentioned above, it was in the Eighties that she served on the  the board of governors of the National Space Institute. In the Nineties Nichelle Nichols appeared in the movie Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991). She was a host on the Sci Fi Channel program Inside Space. She guest starred on the TV shows ABC Weekend Specials and G Vs. E. She was a guest voice on the animated shows Batman: The Animated Series, Gargoyles, Spider-Man, Buzz Lighyear of Star Command, and Futurama.

(2005), Lady Magadalene's (2008), Tru Loved (2008), and The Torturer (2008). She had a recurring role on the TV show Heroes. She appeared in the pilot of the web series The Cabonauts. She was a guest voice on the animated series Futurama and The Simpsons. She appeared in the animated TV movie Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster. In the Teens Nichelle Nichols guest starred on the TV shows The Young and the Restless, Downward Dog, and Space Command. She appeared in the Star Trek television fan film Star Trek: Renegades. She also appeared in the TV movie Sharknado 5: Global Swarming. She appeared in the movies This Bitter Earth (2012), Surge of Power: Revenge of the Sequel (2016), The White Orchid (2018), Mr. Malevolent (2018), Surge of Dawn (2019), and Unbelievable!!!!!. She appeared as Nyota Uhura in the fan-produced movie Star Trek: First Frontier (2020). In 2021 she guest starred on the TV series 12 to Midnight.Nichelle Nichols has been described as a groundbreaking actress, and that is no understatement. While Cicely Tyson was the first Black actress in a major role in a television drama on East Side West Side, her character was the lead character's secretary. This made Nichelle Nichols to the first Black actress to play a character in a position of authority. After all, Nyota was not only the Communications Officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise, but its fifth in command. While Lt. Uhura never got to take command of the Enterprise on the original series, she got to do so twice on Star Trek: The Animated Series. Playing a character of some importance on Star Trek, Nichelle Nichols then paved the way for every Black actress appearing on a television drama ever since. Her importance was certainly not lost on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. After the first season of Star Trek, Nichelle Nichols was considering leaving the show. It was at an NAACP that she was told a fan wanted to meet her. It turned out that the fan was none other than Dr. King himself. He told her that Star Trek was the only show he and his wife would let their children stay up and watch. Nichelle Nichols then told Dr. King she was planning to leave Star Trek. He told her that she couldn't. He told her that \"...for the first time on television, we will be seen as we should be seen every day, as intelligent, quality, beautiful, people who can sing dance, and can go to space, who are professors, lawyers.\" Essentially, Dr. King saw Lt. Uhura as an important role model for Black children and little girls. Of course, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. turned out to be right. As Uhura, Nichelle Nichols inspired many young people to pursue careers as astronauts, astrophysicists, astronomers, and linguists, No less than Dr. Mae Jemison, physician, engineer, and the first female Black astronaut, has cited Nichelle Nichols as an inspiration. She even began every one of her shifts on the space shuttle Endeavor with Uhura's line, \"Hailing frequencies open.\" Through her work with NASA, Nichelle Nichols was responsible for many women and minorities entering the space program.As groundbreaking as Nichelle Nichols' role as Nyota Uhura was, it was not the only role she ever played. She was a talented singer and dancer who had performed in both Porgy and Bess and Carmen Jones. With regards to movies, she played Amelia Brooks, the adoptive mother of the protagonist in Snow Dogs. She was an elderly babysitter in the movie Are We There Yet?. In the movie Truck Turner she played a role as far from Uhura as one can get--Dorinda, who ran a stable of prostitutes. In addition to being a talented actress, dancer, and singer, a true pioneer in television and film, and an activist for the space program, Nichelle Nichols was also well known for her kindness. Following her death George Takei wrote at length about their friendship and her kindness towards him throughout the years. Her kindness did not simply extend to her Star Trek cast mates, but to her fans as well. I know several people who have met her through the years (including my beloved Vanessa) and all of them have said she was one of the sweetest, kindest people they had ever met. Following her death, many fans paid tribute to her, writing about how kind and how nice she was to them. Nichelle was truly a legend. She was a groundbreaking actress who paved the way for Black actors on television and in film ever since. She inspired many to enter scientific and space related fields, and recruited minorities and women into NASA. But ultimately she was also a very kind woman who truly cared for people Nichelle Nichols was a legend and a very definition of a lady."},

{"title": "Vanessa Marquez Singing, \"Fly Me to the Moon\"", "date": "Friday, July 29, 2022", "text": "It was three years ago today that the mother of Vanessa Marquez, a few friends, and myself gathered atop Mount Lee in Los Angeles to scatter Vanessa's ashes. It is for that reason that Vanessa has been on my mind a lot today. I have listened to songs I identify with her and taken note of every butterfly I have seen (Vanessa always said her name meant \"butterfly.\").Among the songs I identify with Vanessa Marquez is \"Fly Me to the Moon.\" It was many years ago that she got the chance to sing \"Fly Me to the Moon\" with jazz singer Rick Blessing at Jax Bar & Grill in Glendale, California. Some of her friends sprung it on Vanessa as a surprise, so she was not expecting it at all and as a result she was nervous. It might seem odd for an actress who had appeared on stage and screen, but Vanessa did suffer from stage fright. It is for that reason she forgot the words, \"Baby, kiss me.\" I think she handled very well. In fact, when I first saw the video I thought it was simply part of the act. Regardless, Vanessa had a beautiful singing voice. It is a shame that she didn't get to utilize it as an actress. The only time she got to sing on television, much less film, was on the classic sketch comedy show Culture Clash. At any rate, if I hadn't loved Vanessa before seeing this video, I certainly would have fallen in love with her afterwards!Anyway, in memory of my dearest Vanessa Rosalia Marquez, here she is singing, \"Fly Me to the Moon\" in duet with Rick Blessing."},

He also directed episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine; Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Crusade; Cover Me: Based on the True Life of an FBI Family; and Manhattan, AZ. He also directed the TV documentary Child Stars: Their Story and produced the TV movies The Adventures of Captain Zoom in Outer Space and It Came From Outer Space II. In the Naughts he appeared in the movie Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star (2003). In the Teens he guest starred on the TV series Suspense.Tony Dow was also a talented sculptor. He was one of only two American sculptors whose sculptures were featured at the Carrousel du Louvre. His work was also displayed at the  Salon 2008 de la National des Beaux Arts in Paris.  His works have been displayed at he  Karen Lynne Gallery, Topanga Canyon Gallery, the Morgan Gallery, and the Bilotta Gallery.While I am not nearly as big a fan of Leave It to Beaver as many of my generation, I always appreciated that it was the first sitcom to focus on the kids in the family rather than the parents. What is more, Tony Dow was perfect as Wally, the big brother many with they had. Of course, he played many more roles than just Wally. On Diagnosis Murder he played  a role as far from Wally as one could get, a television network executive. On Adam-12 he played a young corporal in the military whose car had been stolen. On Love, American Style he played a husband whose wife was leaving him. Over the years Tony Dow not only played Wally, but medical doctors, school principals, and motorcyclists as well.Of course, Tony Dow also directed several hours of television. He was a very good television director and seemed to have a gift for both science fiction and comedy. His episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, \"Field of Fire,\" is one of the best of the series.In real life, Tony Dow was a lot like Wally, simply a nice guy. While I never got to meet Mr. Dow, I have many friends who did and they all the said same thing. He really was the big brother everyone wanted. Tony Dow was a talented actor, a talented director, a talented sculptor, and, most importantly of all, simply a good person."},

I have never heard of a fan who had a bad experience meeting Paul Sorvino. His wife Dee Dee is on Twitter and has taken part in both TCMParty and Svengoolie live tweets. She would sometimes relay something Paul had said, and his niceness would shine through. Paul Sorvino was a remarkable actor, a remarkable tenor, and a remarkable man. The world seems a little dimmer without him."},
{"title": "The Late Great Bob Rafelson", "date": "Monday, July 25, 2022", "text": "Bob Rafelson, the co-creator of the TV series The Monkees with Bert Schneider and director of such films as Head (1968), Five Easy Pieces (1970), The King of Marvin Gardens (1972), and Mountains of the Moon (1990), died on July 23 2022 at the age of 89. The cause was lung cancer.Bob Rafelson was born on February 21 1933 in New York City. His father, Sidney Rafelson, was a hat ribbon manufacturer. Among his cousins was screenwriter and playwright Samson Raphaelson, who wrote such Ernst Lubitsch films as The Shop Around the Corner (1940) and Heaven Can Wait (1943). He attended Trinity-Pawling School in Pawling, New York. He took an interest in movies while very young, watching as many as four films a day. He left home when he was only a teenager. For a time he was a rodeo rider, as well as a jazz musician in Acapulco. It was the latter job that would serve as some of the inspiration for the TV show The Monkees. He studied philosophy at Dartmouth College before being drafted into the United States Army. In the Army he served as a disc jockey in Japan. There he also translated Japanese films into English and served as an advisor to  Shochiku Film Company. In Japan he developed an interest in Japanese cinema, particularly the movies of  Yasujirō Ozu. Once his service in the Army was over, Bob Rafelson returned to the United States. He broke into television as a script editor on the Play of the Week episode \"Burning Bright\" in 1959. In the same year he served as a script editor on the TV movie The World of Sholom Aleichem. He also wrote several episodes of Play of the Week. From 1960 to 1961 he served as a story editor on David Susskind's television series as a story editor on The Witness. He also wrote one episode of the show. In the Sixties he moved to Hollywood where he went to work for Universal. He served as an associate producer on the TV shows The Greatest Show on Earth and Channing before leaving Universal over a disagreement with  Lew Wasserman. He also wrote one episode of The Greatest Show on Earth.It was in 1965, while Bob Rafelson was working at Screen Gems, that he and Bert Schneider formed Raybert Productions. Messrs. Rafelson and Schneider created the TV show The Monkees, based in part on Mr. Rafelson's experiences in Mexico as a jazz musician and The Beatles' movies A Hard Day's Night (1964) and Help! (1965). While The Monkees only received moderate ratings, the TV show and the band both became phenomena in the mid to late Sixties, with success on the record charts and a good deal of merchandise.In addition to producing The Monkees, he also directed and wrote episodes. Bob Rafelson made his feature film directorial debut with The Monkees' movie Head (1968). Bob Rafelson served as a producer on the film Easy Rider (1969). He produced and directed the movie Five Easy Pieces (1970).  It was after Easy Rider came out that Raybert Productions became BBS Productions with the addition of Stephen Blauner as a partner. In the Seventies Bob Rafelson served as a producer on the movies The Last Picture Show (1971), The King of Marvin Gardens (1972), La maman et la putain (1973), and Stay Hungry (1976). He directed the film The King of Marvin Gardens (1972) and Stay Hungry (1976). In the Eighties he produced and directed the film The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981). He directed the films Black Widow (1987) and Mountains of the Moon (1990). In the Nineties Bob Rafelson directed the movies Man Trouble (1992) and Blood and Wine (1996). He directed the segment \"Wet\" for the movie Tales of Erotica (1996). He also directed an episode of the TV show Picture Windows and the TV movie Poodle Springs. In the Naughts he directed the film No Good Deed (2002). He directed the TV documentary Afterthoughts.I cannot estimate the impact that Bob Rafelson has had on my life. As the co-creator of The Monkees, I can truly say my life would be very different if Bob Rafelson had never existed. As much as I owe to Bob Rafelson for the creation of The Monkees, I know that it was far from his only achievement. Quite simply, Bob Rafelson directed some of my favourite movies, including Head, Five Easy Pieces, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981) and Mountains of the Moon. As a director he was versatile. His films ranged from the virtually plotless, freewheeling Head to the drama The King of Marvin Gardens to the neo-noir Black Widow to the Sir Richard Francis Burton historical epic Mountains of the Moon. What is more, Bob Rafelson never conformed to what the major studios thought a film should be. He made movies his own way, even when it meant clashing with the Hollywood establishment. As both the co-creator of The Monkees and a movie director who leaves behind a considerable legacy."},
{"title": "The Late Great Alan Grant", "date": "Saturday, July 23, 2022", "text": "Comic book writer Alan Grant, who worked on such features as Judge Dredd and Batman, died on July 20 2022 at the age of 73. He had been ill for some time.Alan Grant was born on February 9 1949 in Bristol, England. He was only one year old when his family moved to Newtongrange, Midlothian, Scotland. He attended Newtongrange Primary School and Dalkeith High School. He worked at a bank for a short time before answering an ad for trainee journalists in the local newspaper. Alan Grant became an editor at DC Thompson, the company that publishes The Beano, The Dandy, Commando, and other comic magazines. He later returned to college and worked a number of odd jobs before encountering fellow comics writer and DC Thompson veteran John Wagner. John Wagner was working for IPC on the launch of a new science fiction comics magazine 2000 AD. John Wagner asked Alan Grant to help him with a Tarzan comic.John Wagner later asked Alan Grant to contribute work to IPC's short-lived science fiction comics magazine Starlord (not to be confused with the Marvel Comics character). This eventually led to Alan Grant obtaining an editorial position on 2000 AD. Alan Grant would later work with John Wagner on such features for 2000 AD  as Ace Trucking Co., Robo-Hunter, Strontium Dog, and Judge Dredd. In addition to 2000 AD, Alan Grant also wrote IPC's revival of Eagle. There he worked on such features as Doomlord, Joe Soap, The House of Daemon, and so on. It was in the late Eighties that Alan Grant did his first work for DC Comics in the United States. With John Wagner he wrote the limited series Outcasts, published from October 1987 to September 1988. The two of them then began writing for the character Batman beginning with Detective Comics no. 583 (February 1988). They introduced such characters as The Ventriloquist and The Ratcatcher. It was after about twelve issues that the partnership between Alan Grant and John Wagner dissolved, after which Alan Grant wrote the character of Batman on his own. It was in 1989 that he introduced the character of Anarky in Detective Comics no. 608 (November 1989). In the Nineties Alan Grant continued to work on various Batman titles, as well as on such titles at DC Comics as Lobo, L.E.G.I.O.N., The Demon, and Catwoman, among others. It was in the pages of Batman: Shadow of the Bat that he introduced the villain Victor Szsasz and the character of Jeremiah Arkham. While writing for DC Comics, Alan Grant continued to write for other companies. With John Wagner he wrote the four issue adventures series The Last American. Reportedly it was The Last American, along with the \"Chopper\" storyline in Judge Dredd, that led to the dissolution of the partnership between John Wagner and Alan Grant. The two divided the strips upon which they worked between them. John Wagner kept Judge Dredd and Alan grant kept Judge Anderson and Strontium Dog. They would later work together on some special projects, such as Judgement on Gotham, a Batman/Judge Dredd crossover. One of these projects was The Bogie Man, which was published independently after DC Comics refused it. He also worked on the British comic Toxic! and served as a consultant on Judge Dredd Magazine. For Toxic! he wrote such features as Makabre, Garbage Man, Among Alan Grant's work beyond 2000 AD  and DC Comics were \"Doctor Who: Invaders From Gantac\" in Doctor Who Magazine issues no. 148 to 150; The Chronicles of Genghis Grimtoad for the British Marvel magazine Strip; The Bogie Man; Psychonauts (for Epic Comics); Jeremiah Harm(for Boom! Studios); LEGO Rock Raiders: High Adventure, Deep Underground; The Dead (Kingdom of Flies) for Berserker Comics; and Church of Hell for Berserker Comics. Alan Grant and his wife Sue organized the annual Moniaive Comics Festival. In 2020 he helped his fellow residents of Moniaive, Dumfries and Galloway, produce a comic, Moniaive Fights Back, about life during the COVID-19 pandemic. All proceeds went to a financial recovery fund for the village, called Revitalise Moniaive.Alan Grant was one of my favourite comic books writers of all time. He had a gift for staying loyal to well-established characters, such as Batman, while at the same time writing about them in ways that were starkly novel. His characters, whether they were ones he had created (such as Anarky or long-running characters like Batman or the Legion of Superheroes, were always four-dimensional with personalities all their own. Mr. Grant had a particular talent for often cynical satire, which was often on  display in his work on Judge Dredd.  He was well known for nurturing young talent and has even been credited with discovering Alan Moore. Alan Grant has had a lasting influence on both British and American comic books that will be continued to be felt for years to come. He was certainly a great talent."},

Okay, the temperatures are hardly like January. It has been overly hot even for Missouri in July. Even so, having eulogized individuals on this blog for the past 18 years, it seems to me that January is the month when more people (at least celebrities) die than any other. This year might be the exception. I swear more people have died this July than usual. Most of my posts this month have been eulogies and I still have at leat two more to write. Today, I have decided to take a break and post something different.It was 45 years ago today that Elvis Costello's debut album, My Aim is True, was released in the United Kingdom. The album would prove to be successful, going to no. 14 on the UK albums chart. It was also critically acclaimed and has since been come considered a classic. The Third single from My Aim is True is \"(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes.\" The song didn't chart in the United Kingdom or the United States, but it remains one of my favourite Elvis Costello songs. I love its Byrds-inspired sound and its subject matter is unusual"},

Manny Charlton was born on July 25 1941 in La Línea, Andalusia, Spain. He was only two when his family migrated to Dunfermline, Scotland. When he was young he played in such bands as The Mark 5 and The Red Hawks. In 1968 Manny Charlton joined the Dunfermline band The Shadettes. After the departure of various members reduced the band to a quartet, The Shadettes renamed themselves \"Nazareth.\" The name was taken from the first line of \"The Weight\" by The Band, \"I pulled into Nazareth, feelin’ ’bout half past dead.\" Nazareth moved from Scotland to London in 1970. They signed to Pegasus Records and their eponymous debut album was released in 1971. Nazareth's first two albums failed to chart, but their third album, Razamanaz, peaked at no. 11 on the UK album chart and no. 157 on the Billboard album chart. Nazareth would have success with singles in the United Kingdom early in their career. Their single \"Bad Bad Boy,\" from the album  album Razamanaz, went to no. 10 o the UK singles chart. Their cover of Joni Mitchell's \"This Flight Tonight\" peaked at no. 11 It was with their sixth album, Hair of the Dog, that Nazareth would have their biggest hit in the United States. The album went to no. 17 on the Billboard album chart. A single from the album, a cover of The Everly Brothers' \"Love Hurts,\" went to no. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single performed even better elsewhere, going to no. 1 in Canada, South Africa, and the Netherlands.Nazareth would never repeat the success of Hair of the Dog in the United States, but the band continued to be popular, releasing several more albums and continuing to tour. Manny Charlton remained with the band, both as its lead guitarist and as a producer on their albums starting with their fifth album Rampant.  He also served as a producer for several other artists, including fellow Nazareth member Dan McCafferty's solo work, Steelheart, Marseille, Vic Vergeat, and Guns 'n' Roses' debut album, Appetite for Destruction, among others. Manny Charlton left Nazareth in 1990. In 1991 he moved to Texas where he formed The Manny Charlton Band. The band released two albums Stonkin and Klone This and disbanded in 2003. A new incarnation of The Manny Charlton Band released the album Hellacious in 2012. Manny Charlton released his first solo album, Drool, in 1999. He would release eight more solo albums. He also recorded albums  with From Behind (Game Over in 2006) and  The Fluffy Jackets (Fighting Demons in 2014 and Something for Nothing in 2019). There can be no doubt that Manny Charlton was responsible for much of the success of Nazareth, both as a producer and as their lead guitarist. His lead guitar had the sound of the blues and certainly set Nazareth apart from other hard rock bands. Manny Charlton could make a guitar create any emotion he wanted. Indeed, despair is evident in Manny Charlton's guitar solo on \"Love Hurts.\" Few guitarists had the skill that Manny Charlton displayed throughout his career."},

TCM dedicates every day in August to a specific star, with 24 straight hours of their films. If there is one disadvantage to Summer Under the Stars it's that TCM's usual programming is pre-empted for the whole month. This means for the whole month of August there is no Noir Alley. Fortunately, film noir fans do not have to to go without their noir fix on TCM the whole month, as during Summer Under the Stars Turner Classic Movies usually shows several film noirs.

{"title": "TCM Summer Under the Stars 2022", "date": "Thursday, July 14, 2022", "text": "Starting in 2003, Turner Classic Movies has dedicated the month of August to the programming block known as Summer Under the Stars. TCM dedicates each day of August to a different star during Summer Under the Stars. Many TCM fans, including myself, look forward to Summer Under the Stars each year (although I do miss seeing Noir Alley each week). This Summer Under the Stars devotes days to many top stars, as well as some lesser known ones. This year TCM did not indicate which stars are being featured during Summer Under the Stars for the first time, and I really can't hazard a guess as to which ones they are.  Regardless, I am glad to see Turner Classic Movies has days dedicated to Jean Arthur, Ruth Roman, Jane Powell, Randolph Scott, Raquel Welch, Toshiro Mifune, Constance Bennett, and Jack Carson. My only real complaint with this year's Summer Under the Stars it that TCM is showing some of my favourite movies at awkward times. For instance, on Jean Arthur's day they are showing The More the Merrier (1943) at 1:30 AM, even though it is one of her most popular movies. On Gene Kelly's day they are showing Singin' in the Rain (1952), arguably his most popular movie of them all, at 3:00 in the afternoon. With other stars there are important movies missing from their days. Why isn't TCM showing Jailhouse Rock (1957) on Elvis's day? I know they showed it this month, but then they also showed Viva Las Vegas (1964). And Lilies in the Field (1963) is conspicuously missing from Sidney Poitier's day. Anyway, below are my picks for each day as to the movies you really don't want to miss. All times are Central.August 1, Elvis Presley:7:00 PM Viva Las Vegas (1964)August 2, Jean Arthur:12:15 PM The Talk of the Town (1942)7:00 PM Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)9:15 PM Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)11:30 PM The Devil and Miss Jones (1941)1:30 AM The More the Merrier (1943)August 3, Sidney Poitier:5:00 AM Edge of the City (1957)6:30 AM The Blackboard Jungle (1955)5:00 PM A Warm December (1972)7:00 PM A Raisin in the Sun (1961)9:15 PM A Patch of Blue (1955)August 4, Ruth Roman:7:00 PM Strangers on a Train (1951)10:45 PM Down Three Dark Streets (1954)August 5, Orson Welles:11:30 AM Journey into Fear (1942)1:00 PM The Stranger (1946)7:00 PM The Third Man (1949)9:00 PM The Lady from Shanghai (1948)10:45 PM Citizen Kane (1941)August 6, Audrey Hepburn:5:00 AM Wait Until Dark (1967)5:00 PM Charade (1963)7:00 PM Roman Holiday (1953)9:15 PM How to Steal a Million (1966)August 7, Gene Kelly:7:00 AM Les Girls (1957)3:00 PM Singin' in the Rain (1952)7:00 PM On the Town (1949)9:00 PM An American in Paris (1951)August 8, Maureen O'Sullivan:9:45 AM The Devil Doll (1936)7:00 PM Tarzan, The Ape Man (1932)9:00 PM Tarzan and His Mate (1934)11:00 PM The Big Clock (1948)August 9, William Holden:3:00 PM Born Yesterday (1950)7:00 PM Sunset Blvd. (1950)10:45 PM Network (1976)August 10, Greta Garbo:1:30 PM Anna Karénina (1935)3:15 PM Ninotchka (1939)12:00 PM Queen Christina (1933)August 11, Laurence Harvey:9:00 AM Life at the Top (1965)7:00 PM The Manchurian Candidate (1962)9:15 PM Walk on the Wild Side (1962)11:15 AM A Room at the Top (1959)August 12, Jane Powell:5:00 AM A Date with Judy (1948)7:00 PM Royal Wedding (1951)9:00 PM Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)August 13, Marlon Brando:7:00 PM A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)9:15 PM The Wild One (1954)August 14, Elizabeth Taylor:10:45 AM Father of the Bride (1950)7:00 PM Giant (1956)10:30 PM Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

{"title": "Godspeed Lenny Von Dohlen", "date": "Wednesday, July 13, 2022", "text": "Lenny Von Dohlen, who starred in the movie Electric Dreams (1984) and played diarist, orchid lover, and agoraphobe Harold Smith on Twin Peaks, died on July 5 2022 at the age of 63 following a long illness.Lenny Von Dohlen was born on December 22 1958 in Augusta, Georgia. He grew up in Goliad, Texas. As a child he wanted to become a jockey. He attended the University of Texas where he majored in drama. After graduating from college he moved to New York City to pursue acting.Lenny Von Dohlen made his television debut in the television movie Kent State in 1981. It was in 1990 that he appeared as Harold Smith on Twin Peaks. He also appeared in the prequel movie, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992). In the Eighties he guest starred on the shows Miami Vice, American Playhouse, ABC Afterschool Specials, Tales from the Darkside, The Equalizer, Thirtysomething, The Young Riders, and Grand. He made his film debut in Tender Mercies in 1983. In the Eighties he appeared in the films Electric Dreams (1984), Billy Galvin (1984), and Dracula's Widow (1988).In the Nineties Mr. Von Dohlen played Mr. Cox on the TV show The Pretender. He guest starred on the shows The Flash; Red Dwarf; Picket Fences; Walker, Texas Ranger; The Lazarus Man; Chicago Hope; and The Magnificent Seven. He appeared in the movies Cold Heaven (1991), Leaving Normal (1992), Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me; Blind Vision (1992), Eyes of the Beholder (1992), Jennifer Eight (1992), Tollbooth (1994), Amberwaves (1994), Bird of Prey (1995), One Good Turn (1996), Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story (1996), Cadillac (1997), Home Alone 3 (1997), and Frontline (1999).In the Naughts he guest starred on the shows CSI: Miami, Ghost Whisperer, Criminal Minds, and Psych. He appeared in the movies Breathing Hard (2001), Teeth (2007), Beautiful Loser (2008), and Downstream (2010). In the Teens Lenny Von Dohlen appeared in the movies Choose (2011), Camilla Dickinson (2012), Annie and the Gypsy (2012), Dark Power (2013), Broken Horse (2015), Threshold (2016), Ray Meets Helen (2017), Just Within Reach (2017), The Maestro (2018), Near Myth: The Oskar Knight Story (2018), and For the Weekend (2020). He guest starred on The Orville. Lenny Von Dohlen was extremely talented. As Miles Harding in Electric Dreams he bought new life to the age-old trope of the sweet guy who falls in love with a beautiful woman (although his rival was a computer...). Harold Smith, with all his eccentricities, could easily have been a one-note character on Twin Peaks, but Mr. Von Dohlen turned him into one of the show's most memorable characters. On The Pretender he played a character as far from Miles Hardin in Electric Dreams as one could get. Mr. Cox was a truly sinister figure, certainly one of the show's creepiest villains. Lenny Von Dohlen played a wide array of characters in leading roles and in roles that only appeared for a few minutes on the screen. And he turned in a good performance every time."},

In the Alfred Hitchcock Hour episode \"An Out for Oscar,\" he plays the timid bank employee of the title, who finds out his wife Eva (Linda Christian) is unfaithful. He was Texas Jack in The Great Race, an overly aggressive and greatly feared, if not particularly competent, outlaw. Larry Storch played the Swami in S.O.B. a parody of spiritual gurus. On the Saturday morning live action TV series he played Eddie Spencer, a more honest version of Corporal Agarn, overly emotional and not terribly bright. Of course, he provided voices for a wide variety of cartoon characters from The Joker on The New Scooby-Doo Movies to Koko the Clown.In addition to being an enormous talent, Larry Storch was also known as a truly sweet man who appreciated his fans. He was well known for his kindness to those fans lucky enough to meet him. He was one of those celebrities one never heard an unkind word about, one of those celebrities that people came away from meeting with smiles and warm hearts. Part of the announcement of Larry Storch's death on his official Facebook page reads, \"Please remember he loved each and every one of you and wouldn't want you to cry over his passing.\" It is safe to say his fans loved him back."},

In Cinderella Liberty he played the lonely sailor John Baggs Jr. He was the stalwart Houston rollerball team captain in Rollerball and Frank, the jewel thief of the title in Thief. James Caan was best known for his \"tough guy\" roles, but he was quite adept at comedy, as shown by his appearances in such films as Slither, Freebie and the Bean, and Elf. James Caan was a great talent capable of playing a diverse number of roles."},

He also wrote an unpublished memoir, The Miseries of Success. Joe Turkel was an incredible actor. In many of his films he only appears for a few minutes at most, yet he always left an indelible impression on viewers. As Lloyd in The Shining, he only appears briefly, yet the character remains memorable. In Blade Runner Dr. Tyrrell is not on screen for long, but is one of the movie's most unforgettable characters. Over the years, Joe Turkel appeared in a large numbers of roles, as well as a large variety of roles. He was comfortable with comedy, guest starring as bank robber Fred in the Andy Griffith Show episode \"Otis the Deputy.\" He played gangsters on The Untouchable, yet he was a district attorney on Ironside and the sheriff in the cult film Village of the Giants. Regardless of what role he played, Joe Turkel always gave a good performance. He will likely always be remembered for The Shining and Blade Runner, but he played so many other roles."},

She later had the recurring role of Inspector Bryn Carson on Nash Bridges. She guest starred on Philly Heat, Hope & Gloria, Dellaventura, The Visitor, NYPD Blue, Ally McBeal, Farscape, G vs E, Law & Order, Profiler, and Rude Awakening.

This is demonstrated by her role as Loretta Sweet on ER. Loretta was a prostitute who occasionally came to the emergency room to be treated. She also had children. Eventually she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Miss Mara played Loretta with a poignancy that makes the character more memorable than some of the regulars on the shows. Of course, she also played Inspector Bryn Carson on Nash Bridges, a character far removed from Loretta. Bryn was a tough, but fair cop who was often called upon to go undercover. Over the years Mary Mara played a wide variety of roles, from a police informant to social workers to alien beings. What is more, she was convincing in all of these roles."},

{"title": "Diana Rigg in The Assassination Bureau (1969)", "date": "Sunday, July 3, 2022", "text": "(This blog post is part of the Other Than Bond Girl Blogathon hosted by Realweedgiemidget Reviews)Chances are good that Dame Diana Rigg will always be best remembered as Emma Peel on the classic television show The Avengers. Of course, she will also be remembered as Countess Tracy di Vicenzo in the James Bond movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). While both The Avengers and On Her Majesty's Secret Service are well remembered, one of Dame Diana Rigg's best movies is nearly forgotten. The Assassination Bureau (1969).The Assassination Bureau stars Diana Rigg as Sonya Winter, a suffragette and journalist who uncovers the Assassination Bureau, Ltd., a secret organization that has existed for centuries and is in the business of murder for hire. Sonya takes a novel approach to putting an end to the Assassination Bureau. Quite simply, her boss, Lord Bostwick (Telly Savalas) gives Sonya £20,000 to hire the Bureau to assassinate their own chairman, Ivan Dragomiloff (Oliver Reed). As it turns out, the Assassination Bureau will only kill those who are truly worthy of death, such as criminals and tyrants. As many of the Assassination Bureau's members have taken to killing for money, Dragomiloff accepts Sonya's assignment and throws down the gauntlet for the other board members of the Bureau to try to kill him.  Of course, as might be expected, things are not quite as they seem.The Assassination Bureau was based on the unfinished novella The Assassination Bureau, Ltd. by Jack London. Jack London had bought the idea for the novella from Sinclair Lewis in 1910. Jack London wrote 20,000 words before he finally gave up on the novella because he could not think of a way to properly end it. Jack London died in 1916, so The Assassination Bureau, Ltd. remained unfinished for decades. Eventually mystery writer Robert L. Fish completed The Assassination Bureau, Ltd. based on both the unfinished manuscript left behind by Jack London and an outline of an ending for the novella created by Jack London's wife Charmian not long before her death in 1955. The Assassination Bureau, Ltd. was then finally published in 1963. Given President John F. Kennedy was assassinated not long after the novella came out, it proved to be a source of some controversy. It was in 1966 that it was announced that director Basil Dearden and producer/screenwriter Michael Relph were making a film based on The Assassination Bureau, Ltd. for United Artists. Basil Dearden and Michael Relph had already made several films together, including The Bells Go Down (1943), The Blue Lamp (1950), Sapphire (1959), and many others. Mr .Dearden had even directed \"The Hearse Driver\" segment of the classic Dead of Night (1945).  While Jack London's novella The Assassination Bureau, Ltd. was rather serious, the movie Messrs. Dearden and Relph had in mind would be an adventure comedy.Michael Relph had in mind an English lead when he wrote the screenplay, but unfortunately United Artists insisted that Burt Lancaster be cast in the lead role. Michael Relph ended up revising the script to fit with the casting of Burt Lancaster, none of which pleased Mr. Lancaster. Burt Lancaster then left the project. Michael Relph attracted the interest of Rex Harrison as the lead in The Assassination Bureau, but United Artists had absolutely no interest in Mr. Harrison. Ultimately, United Artists lost interest in The Assassination Bureau. This not mean that the project was dead. Basil Dearden and Michael Relph took The Assassination Bureau to Paramount Pictures. Ultimately, Michael Relph got the British leading man he had wanted to begin with. Oliver Reed had already established his name as a film actor, having appeared in several Hammer productions, as well as the films The System (1964), The Jokers (1967), and I'll Never Forget Wat 'isname (1967). Of course, the female lead was none other than Diana Rigg. Diana Rigg had already become an outright phenomenon on both sides of the Atlantic in the classic spy TV series The Avengers. Later, in 1969, she would play Tracy, the one woman to win James Bond's heart, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1968). Curiously, Telly Savalas, one of the few non-British actors in the cast of The Assassination Bureau, would play the villain Blofeld in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.While The Assassination Bureau was based on Jack London's The Assassination Bureau, Ltd., the movie differs from the book a good deal. The Assassination Bureau, Ltd. is a very serious work, with some rather deep philosophical underpinnings. In contrast, the movie The Assassination Bureau is a light hearted comedy adventure. Furthermore, while The Assassination Bureau, Ltd. is set in the United States, The Assassination Bureau is set in Europe during the Edwardian Era prior to World War I. Filming on The Assassination Bureau began in April 1968. It was shot on location throughout Europe, including scenes taking place in London, Switzerland, Paris, Venice, Vienna, and Czechoslovakia. Paramount poured a good deal of money into The Assassination Bureau, in the hope that its stars and production value would translate well at the box office.The Assassination Bureau received a trade show release in March 1969 and went into wide release in April 1969. For the most part reviews were positive. The review in The Guardian referred to The Assassination Bureau as \"elegant, quite witty, engaging\" and complimented both Basil Dearden's direction and Michael Relph's screenplay. John Russell Taylor of The Times described it as \"a killingly funny film.\" The film did receive some negative reviews as well. The critic at the Daily Express was particularly vicious with regards to the movie, stating that he \"didn't like the beginning or the middle, but I loved the end--simply because it meant the ordeal was over.\" The Assassination Bureau would receive some recognition by various awards. The Assassination Bureau was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best English Language Foreign Film and Diana Rigg was nominated for the Laurel for Female New Face.In the United Kingdom The Assassination Bureau did modestly well at the box office in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, it did little business in the all important market of the United States. I think it could be possible that the film's title, The Assassination Bureau, could have been unappealing to Americans, the previous year (1968) having seen the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy. It could also be the case that in 1969 The Assassination Bureau was already something of an anachronism. In the mid-Sixties such period piece pastiches as The Great Race (1965), Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965), and The Wrong Box (1966) were popular. At the same time, spy spoofs from Our Man Flint (1966) to The Silencers (1966) met with success. By 1969, both the period piece pastiches and particularly spy spoofs were no longer quite as fashionable. Since The Assassination Bureau was bit of a period piece pastiche and bit of a spy spoof, it should probably be no surprise that it was met with indifference in the United States.That The Assassination Bureau had less than stellar box office numbers in the United States is disappointing in retrospect. Quite simply, The Assassination Bureau is a highly enjoyable film. Oliver Reed is remarkable as the chairman of the Assassination Bureau who comes to question the organization's morality. Diana Rigg does a great job as Sonya, who shares both Emma Peel and Tracy Bond's independence, but is different enough that she is not a carbon copy of those characters. The script has no shortage of laughs and no shortage of excitement either. And it must be pointed out that, even in the Sixties, there weren't many movies with a climax aboard a Zeppelin. The Assassination Bureau may not be one of Diana Rigg's best remembered movies, but there is every reason it should be."},
{"title": "Special Theme: Black Independents on Turner Classic Movies on Wednesday in July", "date": "Thursday, June 30, 2022", "text": "Daughters of the DustThis July Turner Classic Movies will be showing movies with the Special Theme of Black Independents on Wednesdays. Neither the Silent Era nor the Golden Age of Hollywood were very golden for African Americans. The major studios gave Black actors very little in the way of meaningful roles, with many African American characters being little more than stereotypes. As a result, Black filmmakers had to make movies outside the major studios, movies with primarily Black casts free of the stereotypes so prevalent in the Hollywood movies of the time. Financing was often along the same lines as independent filmmaking remains today, and budgets were often low. With segregation existing throughout much of the United States in the Twenties, Thirties, and Forties, race films were almost always shown at Black theatres and in Black neighbourhoods. While race films would disappear in the early Fifties, Black independent filmmakers have continued making movies to this very day.The films TCM is showing for the Special Theme on Black Independents range from the Silent Era to the 21st Century. The oldest is Oscar Micheaux's The Symbol of the Unconquered, dating to 1921.  The newest is the documentary Oscar Micheaux: The Superhero of Black Filmmaking, dating to last year. Viewers will definitely want to tune in Wednesday, June 6 when TCM will be showing Black independent movies from the Silent Era to the Forties. These include Oscar Micheaux's The Symbol of the Unconquered (1921), Powell Lindsay's Souls of Sin (1949), Richard E. Norman's The Flying Ace (1926), and Spencer Williams Jr.'s The Blood of Jesus (1941) and Dirty Gertie from Harlem U.S.A. (1946).Of course, TCM will also be showing more recent films on Wednesday nights in July. On July 13 Turner Classic Movies will be showing Bill Duke's The Killing Floor (1984), an American Playhouse film centred on two sharecrooppers who find jobs in the meatpacking industry in Chicago in the 1930s. It is on late, so viewers will want to set our DVRs. On July 20 TCM is showing Hollywood Shuffle (1987), Robert Townsend's excellent satire of African American stereotypes. Later that same night The Watermelon Woman, Cheryl Dunye's comedy about a video store employee who sets out to make a documentary about a 1930s actress best known for playing stereotypical Mammy roles, airs. On July 27, TCM is showing the classic Daughters of the Dust (1991). Directed by Julie Dash, the film follows a family of Gullah islanders in 1902.

The movies airing as part of the TCM Spotlight on the History of Rock on Film span most of the history of rock music, from Jailhouse Rock in 1957 to Sid and Nancy in 1986. Among the films airing on TCM Spotlight: the History of Rock on Film is perhaps the greatest rock musical of all time, The Beatles' movie A Hard Day's Night (1964). As most readers of this blog know, it is one of my favourite movies of all time. Also among the movies I suggest that TCM viewers will not want to miss is Jailhouse Rock, featuring Elvis Presley in his prime. Catch Us if You Can (1965) is stars The Dave Clark Five and is decidedly different from A Hard Day's Night. Don't Look Back (1967) is a documentary is a documentary that follows Bob Dylan on his 1965 tour of England. Bikini Beach (1964) might seem like an unusual choice for the History of Rock on Film, but it features perforances by Stevie Wonder, The Pyramids, and The Exciters. Viva Las Vegas (1964) is my favourite Elvis movie of all time and features the incredible Ann-Margret. Among the other must-see movies are The Harder They Come (1972), starring reggae and ska star Jimmy Cliff, and Pink Floyd: The Wall (1982).For TCM Spotlight: the History of Rock on Film, Turner Classic Movies has a fairly good line-up of movies. The only changes I would make is that I would have put The Who's movie The Kids Are Alright (1979) and Cliff Richard's Summer Holiday (1963) in there as well. I don't know that I would have included ABBA--The Movie (1977), as I don't think Abba can be considered rock even by the loosest definition of the genre.Anyway, here is the schedule for TCM Spotlight: Rock on Film.

{"title": "Salvatore Romano on Mad Men", "date": "Tuesday, June 28, 2022", "text": "In the Fifties and Sixties, homosexual characters were rarely seen on American television. When they did appear, they were often portrayed as caricatures. This changed in the Seventies with the debut of the short-lived, 1972 summer replacement show The Corner Bar. This largely forgotten sitcom was historic for introducing the first recurring gay character on an American television show.  Unfortunately, Peter Panama (Victor Schiavelli) was portrayed as such a stereotype that Rich Wandel, then the president of the Gay Activists Alliance, referred to the character as \"the worst stereotype of a gay person I've ever seen.\" Fortunately, since then gay characters on American television have been portrayed much more realistically. Among the best known gay characters to appear on American television in the twenty years was Salvatore Romano (Bryan Batt), the art director at Sterling Draper, during the first three seasons of the TV show Mad Men.In some respects, Sal conformed to previous stereotypes of gay men in American society. He was close to his mother, with whom he would often talk on the phone in Italian. He was extremely fashionable, always wearing the best clothes, and urbane. Indeed, in the sixth episode of Mad Men, \"Babylon,\" when lead character Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and his wife Betty (January Jones) are discussing actress Joan Crawford, Don tells Betty, \"All men love Joan Crawford. Salvatore never stops talking about her.\" For the most part, however, Sal transcended old stereotypes of gay men. Sal Romano became a fully developed character, and he also remains one of the most popular characters on Mad Men.Mad Men being set in the Sixties, Sal is a closeted gay man, passing as straight. To this end, he often jokes with the other men of Sterling Draper about women. Sal also refrains from any homosexual activity during the first season of Mad Men. one has to think for fear of being discovered. In the episode\"The Hobo Code,\" Sal has dinner with Sterling Draper client and Belle Jolie executive Elliott Lawrence (Paul Keeley), but declines his invitation to go back to his room.  It must be kept in mind that the time period in which  Mad Men was initially set in 1960, a time when the Lavender Scare was still very much underway. The Lavender Scare was a moral panic over homosexuality that lasted from the end of World War II into the Sixties. Homosexuality was still included the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association as a mental disorder. It is perhaps to continue passing as straight that between the first and second seasons of Mad Men Sal married Kitty Romano (Sarah Drew). Initially, Sal and Kitty's marriage seems happy, although, as might be expected, it son develops problems. In the episode \"The Gold Violin,\" when Sal invites Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton), on whom Sal has a slight crush,  to dinner at their apartment, Sal pays more attention to Ken than he does Kitty. Things come to a head in Sal and Kitty's marriage in the episode \"The Arrangements.\" Kitty complains to Sal about their lack of sexual intimacy. It is when Sal re-enacts Sterling Cooper's commercial for Patio Diet Cola, which is a take-off on the opening of the movie Bye Bye Birdie (1963) in the same episode, that Kitty finally realizes Sal is gay.While the audience realizes from the beginning that Sal is gay, for most of his run on Mad Men no one at Sterling Cooper does. But then Salvatore Romano is deep in the closet. As mentioned earlier, he jokes with the other men at the agency about women. In the first season he also refrains from any homosexual liaisons. As far as the rest of Sterling Cooper is concerned, Sal is straight. He is also a valued member of Sterling Cooper. Don Draper respects Sal's opinion in artistic matters and he is often allowed more input into advertising campaigns than some of the copywriters. In \"The Arrangements\" Don selects Sal to direct the television spot for Patio Cola, a task that he excels at.While Sal was very much in the closet in the first and second seasons, in the third season episode \"Out of Town,\" while Sal and Don are on a business trip to Baltimore, that Sal permits himself a tryst with a male hotel bellhop. Don discovers this after a fire breaks out in the hotel. Much to Sal's relief, Don never mentions what he saw to Sal. On the plane flight back to New York City, Don does suggest the line \"Limit Your Exposure\" for the campaign for London Fog raincoats. Sadly, one of the people who realizes that Sal is gay is Lee Garner, Jr. of Lucky Strike, Sterling Cooper's top account. In the episode \"Wee Small Hours\" Garnet made a pass at Sal, which Sal rebuffs. Garner demanded Harry Crane remove Sal from the account and when Harry did not do so, Roger Sterling fired Sal in order to keep the Lucky Strike account. The last time we see Sal is in the same episode. He is in a phone booth at a truck stop, apparently arranging to meet another man.Sal's departure from Mad Men was not popular with fans. According to Bryan Batt in an interview with Esquire in 2015, after Sal left the show \"there was a big write-in outcry.\" I find this entirely believable, as I know that Sal was a favourite among myself and my fellow Mad Men fans and all of us were disappointed that he would no longer be on the show. Of course, many Mad Men fans always hoped for Sal's return. He never did, not even in the show's final season. That leaves Mad Men fans with the question of \"What ever happened to Salvatore Romano?\" In the same interview Bryan Batt relates that Matt Weiner once told him that Sal would come back as a big director, but he thought the \"storyline took a different route.\" As to Bryan Batt's opinion as to what happened to Sal, in the Esquire interview he said that he'd like to think \"Sal had a happy ending,\" although that it would mean breaking his wife Kitty's heart. Bryan Batt thought that after Sal's mother died, he would finally come out of the closet. In the Esquire interview, Bryan Batt said, \"I imagine him walking through the West Village as Stonewall happens and getting swept up in it.\" I don't know about other Mad Men fans, but I always thought Sal probably got a job as an art director at another agency. I think he probably continued directing television commercials and may have eventually directed television shows and even movies. And I do think, once his mother died, he came out of the closet.As to why Sal Romano remains a fan favourite among Mad Men fans, I think there is a number of reasons. The first is that Sal was among the very few decent men at Sterling Cooper. While he might joke with the other men about women in his effort to pass as straight, he always treated the secretaries and other employees at Sterling Cooper with decency. Sal also has a dignity that many of the other people at Sterling Cooper does not. He could have very easily given into Lee Garner, Jr.'s advances, but instead he chose to stand up for himself. Honestly, I would not want to work with Don Draper, much less Pete Campbell, but I think Sal would be very pleasant to work with. Second, I think many people can identify with Sal beyond gay men, even cisgender, heterosexual men such as myself. In the aforementioned Esquire interview, Bryan Batt said of Sal \"I think everyone in their lives, in some way, shape, or form, pretends to fit in. Anyone who has felt they didn't belong, who felt as if they couldn't be themselves among others, can then identify with Sal whether they are gay, straight, or whatever. While there were gay characters on American television before Salvatore Romano on Mad Men, in some ways he was a groundbreaking character. While gay characters had appeared on American television before Sal, Sal was probably one of the earliest closeted gay men portrayed in an American period television, if not possibly the first. Through the skill of the writers on Mad Men and Bryan Batt's talent as an actor, Sal became one of the best developed characters on the show. He also became one of the best loved."},
{"title": "Save the Historic Castro Theatre in San Francisco", "date": "Saturday, June 25, 2022", "text": "The Castro Theatre is well-known even to those of us who aren't from the Bay Area or have spent significant time in San Francisco. The theatre was founded by the Nasser Brothers, who had begun showing movies at their father's grocery and candy factory and later a small, 600 seat theatre. The architect who designed the Castro Theatre, Timothy L. Plueger, would also design the  the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building in San Francisco. He would also design other theatres, including the Alhambra and El Rey in San Francisco and the Paramount in Okalnd  Its opening on June 22 1922 was attended by then San Francisco mayor Sunny Jim Rolph. The first film shown at the Castro Theatre was Across the Continent (1922), starring Wallace Reid. The Castro Theatre was operated by the Nasser family until 1976, at which point they leased the theatre to San Francisco film exhibitor Mel Novikoff. After that lease ended, the Castro Theatre shifted to showing repertory movies and hosting film festivals. Among the festivals it has hosted are the Berlin & Beyond Festival, CAAMFest, the San Francisco Film Noir Festival, San Francisco International Film Festival, the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, and others.Unfortunately, it was earlier this year that Another Planet Entertainment partnered with the Castro Theatre's current owner, Bay Properties. Another Planet Entertainment plans to level the theatre's floor (taking away its slope) and removing seats for rock concerts. As connoisseurs of classic theatres know, removing the slope and removing seats would ruin the Castro Theatre's effectiveness as a movie theatre. The Castro Theatre Conservancy has then been formed in order to retain as much of the interior of the Castro Theatre as possible. Among its supporters are such big names as Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson, Danay Delaney, David Byrne, Leonard Maltin, and yet others. The Castro Theatre Conservancy has set up a petition on Change.org \"to ensure that the historic orchestra seating and sloped floor that are so essential to preserving the filmgoing experience are maintained.\" If you love beautiful old movie palaces, by all means sign this petition."},
{"title": "Godspeed Maureen Arthur", "date": "Wednesday, June 22, 2022", "text": "Maureen Arthur, who played Hildy both the Broadway production of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and the 1967 movie adaptation, died on June 15 2022 at the age of 88. She had been suffering from Alzheimer's  disease for some time.Maureen Arthur was born on April 15 1934 in San Jose, California. She grew up in St. Louis. Her father operated a movie theatre and as a little girl she would perform on stage during vaudeville nights. She was attending Northeastern University when she won a talent contest on The Garry Moore Show. She won a gig at the Palace in New York City for a week and the chance to compete on the television talent show Chance of a Lifetime. She won Chance of a Lifetime for six straight weeks. Maureen Arthur acting at the Neighbourhood Playhouse in New York City.Miss Arthur made her television debut in 1956 as a regular on Tonight! starring Steve Allen. In the Fifties she guest starred on the TV shows Flight, Whirlybirds, Bourbon Street Beat, Not For Hire, and Richard Diamond, Detective. She made her film debut in Hot Rod Gang in 1958. In the Sixties Maureen Arthur was a regular on the TV shows Holiday Lodge and What's It All About, World?. She guest starred on the shows General Electric Theatre; Bachelor Father; The Red Skelton Show; Perry Mason; Branded; I Spy; Hank; Get Smart; The Hero; Please Don't Eat the Daisies; The Monkees; The Flying Nun; That's Life; Gomer Pyle : USMC; and Love, American Style. She toured with How to Succeed in Business Without Trying for two years before appearing in the play on Broadway. She also appeared on Broadway in Something Different.  She appeared in the movies How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying? (1967), Thunder Alley (1967), The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz (1968), A Man Called Dagger (1968), Killers Three (1968), How to Commit Marriage (1969),  and The Love God? (1969). In the Seventies she guest starred on the TV shows Love, American Style; Night Gallery; Sanford and Son; The New Dick Van Dyke Show; Kolchak: The Night Stalker; Joe and Sons; Laverne & Shirley; CPO Sharkey; and The Stockard Channing Show. She was a regular during a story arc on the live action Saturday morning television show The Red Hand Gang. She appeared in the movies The Love Machine (1971) and Harry and Walter Go to New York (1976). In the Eighties Maureen Arthur was a regular on the show Empire. She guest starred on the TV shows Mork & Mindy; The Duck Factory; Too Close for Comfort; Murder, She Wrote; Highway to Heaven, and Matlock. In the Nineties she guest starred on Empty Nest.In addition to acting, Maureen Arthur also recorded the singles \"Don't Make the Angels Cry\" and What Does He Do With Her\" on the Carlton labelMiss Arthur was president of the Variety Club of Southern California children’s charity for several years.  I have to think Maureen Arthur will always be remembered best as Hedy in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and with good reason. She was wonderful in the role. And it seems as if many of her roles in both television and movies were similar to the not-too-bright Hedy. She played Lois, a divorcee pursuing Frank Benson (Bob Hope) in How to Commit Marriage. In The Love God? she played the cover girl of the magazine The Peacock, a nudie magazine along the lines of Playboy.  On television she played gangsters moll Ruby in the Monkees episode \"Alias Micky Dolenz\" That having been said, Maureen Arthur was fully capable of playing other sorts of roles. In The Love Machine she played a not so nice character, publicist and office tramp Ethel Evans. In the Get Smart episode \"The Contessa,\" she played a KAOS agent, Contessa Montenegro (who would seem to be at take off on the Gabor Sisters). In addition to being a talented actress, Maureen Arthur was also a very good singer. She devoted literally years to Variety, the Children's Charity. Maureen Arhtur was entirely wonderful. While she will probably always be best remembered as Hedy, she did much more."},
{"title": "Announcing the 9th Annual Rule, Britannia Blogathon ", "date": "Tuesday, June 21, 2022", "text": "I am proud to announce the 8th Annual Rule, Britannia Blogathon, which will take place on September 17, 18, and 19 2022.While many people think of Hollywood when they think of classic movies, the fact is that the United Kingdom made many significant contributions to film over the years. From the Gainsborough melodramas to Hammer Films to the British New Wave, cinema would be much poorer without the British.Here are the ground rules for this year's blogathon:1. Posts can be about any British film or any topic related to British films. For the sake of simplicity, I am using \"British\" here to refer to any film made by a company based in the United Kingdom or British Crown dependencies. If you want to write about a film made in Northern Ireland or the Isle of Man, then, you can do so. Also for the sake of simplicity, people can write about co-productions made with companies from outside the United Kingdom. For example, since 2001: A Space Odyssey is a British-American co-production, someone could write about it if they chose.2. There is no limit on subject matter. You can write about any film in any genre you want. Posts can be on everything from the British New Wave to the Gainsborough bodice rippers to the Hammer Horrors. I am also making no limit on the format posts can take. You could review a classic British film, make an in-depth analysis of a series of British films, or even simply do a pictorial tribute to a film. That having been said, since this is a classic film blogathon,  I only ask that you write about films made before 2012. I generally don't think of a film as a classic until it has been around for thirty years, but to give bloggers more options I am setting the cut off point at ten years ago.3. I am asking that there please be no duplicates. That having been said, if someone has already chosen to cover From Russia with Love (1963), someone else could write about the James Bond series as a whole.4. I am not going to schedule days for individual posts. All I ask is that the posts be made on or between September 7, 18, and 19 2022.

{"title": "More Native Americans on Television", "date": "Saturday, June 18, 2022", "text": "With the exception of the Fifties, Sixties, and Seventies, Native American characters have been nearly non-existent on television in the United States. And in the Fifties, Sixties, and Seventies, Native American characters were generally confined to the Westerns of the era and played by white actors or actors of yet other ethnicities than Indigenous. It was exceedingly rare that a Native American character even appeared in a present day setting. It is then remarkable that within the past year and a quarter three different shows featuring Native Americans in lead roles have debuted. What is more, two of those of shows have casts that are almost entirely Native American.The first of these three shows to debut was Rutherford Falls. The show debuted on Peacock on April 22 2021. It was created by Ed Helms (perhaps best known for The Office), Michael Schur (co-creator of Parks and Recreation and The Good Place), and Sierra Teller Ornelas (who served as a producer on Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Superstore. While Messrs. Helms and Schur are white, Ms. Teller Ornelas is Navajo. Rutherford Falls is set in the small town of the same name, where a controversy over a statue in the town pits best friends Nathan Rutherford (Ed Helms), a descendent of the town's founder) and Reagan Wells, a member of the Minishonka Nation. A good number of the cast are Native Americans. What is more, half of the writers on the show are Indigenous. Rutherford Falls has been well received. Furthermore, Rutherford Falls does not rely on stereotypes the way previous shows have, nor does it mythologize American Indians.The second Native American show to debut was Reservation Dogs. It premiered on FX on Hulu on August 9 2021. Reservation Dogs follows a group of group of Indigenous teens as they try to navigate life on a reservation. It was created by New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo. Sterlin Hajro is a citizen of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and has Muskogee heritage. He has directed the films Four Sheets to the Wind (2007), Barking Water (2009), and Mekko (2015).If anything Reservation Dogs goes even further than Rutherford Falls in representation. Its cast is almost entirely Indigenous, as is its production team. Every single one of its writers is Native American. It is shot on location in Okmulgee, the capitol of the Muscogee Nation. This also makes it the first TV series to be shot entirely in Oklahoma.  Reservation Dogs has received a good deal of critical acclaim. It is notable for featuring no stereotypes and presenting Native life from a Native point of view. The third new Native American show just debuted this past Sunday, June 12. Dark Winds is based on Tony Hillerman's Leaphorn & Chee mystery novels, which centre on the Navajo Tribal policemen Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. While Tony Hillerman wrote the Leaphorn & Chee novels from 1970 to 2006, Dark Winds is set in 1971 on the Navajo Reservation. The vast majority of the cast of Dark Winds are Indigenous (an exception is Noah Emmerich, who plays FBI agent Whitover). The nearly all of the crew are Native American.  Among its producers is Chris Eyre, perhaps best known for the classic film Smoke Signals (1998). The writers on Dark Winds are entirely Native American. Indeed, it was Graham Roland, who is a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation, who developed Dark Winds for television. Dark Winds has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Dark Winds differs from both Rutherford Falls and Reservation Dogs in that, while they are comedies, it is a thriller. The show is free of stereotypes and told from a Native viewpoint.With three Native American shows having debuted recently, I am hoping that there will be more to follow. Native Americans have been largely invisible on American television for much of its history. When Native American characters have appeared, they have often been confined to the Old West and, even when they appear in a modern day setting, have been heavily romanticized. Rutherford Falls, Reservation Dogs, and Dark Winds are s big step forward for Native representation. I hope that it is just the beginning of more to come."},
{"title": "The Late Great Tim Sale", "date": "Friday, June 17, 2022", "text": "Tim Sale, the artist best known for his work on various Batman titles (particularly the miniseries The Long Halloween), died yesterday, June 16 2022, at the age of 66. No cause was listed, but the had been admitted to hospital for severe health issues.Tim Sale was born on May 1 1956 in Ithaca, New York. His father was the literary critic and author Roger Sale. His uncle was author Kirkpatrick Sale. He spent most of his childhood in Seattle. He attended the University of Washington for two years before moving to New York City and attending the School of Visual Arts. He began his artistic career in 1983, providing artwork for the comic book adaptation of the novel series MythAdventures and then the comic book adaptation of the shared universe book series Thieves' World. In 1988 he drew an issue of the comic book Grendel. He later became the series' regular artist.It was in 1991 that DC Comics editor Elliot S! Maggin hired Tim Sale for the mini-series Challengers of the Unknown. The writer on the miniseries was screenwriter Jeph Loeb, who co-wrote the films Teen Wolf (1985) and Commando (1987), among other movies. Tim Sale and Jeph Loeb would become frequent collaborators, including Batman: The Long Halloween, Batman: Dark Victory, Superman for All Seasons, and others. At DC Comics would work on such projects as the 1992 story arc \"Blades\" in Legends of the Dark Knight, the story arc \"Misfits\" in Shadow of the Bat, and the Wildstorm title Deathblow,In 1995 Tim Sale illustrated the Wolverine/Gambit miniseries at Marvel. It was from 1996 to 1997 that Tim Sale and Jeph Loeb created the miniseries Batman: The Long Halloween. The yearlong miniseries received considerable acclaim and is now regarded as a classic. In 1998 they collaborated on the miniseries Superman for All Seasons. That same year Tim Sale contributed to the anthology Grendel: Black, White and Red. In 1999 Tim Sale and Jeph Loeb collaborated on the sequel to The Long Halloween, Batman: Dark Victory. That same year they contributed a story to Vampirella: Rebirth no. 1. Over the next few years the duo would work on such projects for Marvel as Daredevil: Yellow, Spider-Man: Blue, and Hulk: Gray. In 2003 they contributed a backup story to JSA All Stars no. 2. In 2004 they collaborated on Catwoman: When in Rome, and the first issue of Solo. Their last comic book collaboration was on Captain America: White for Marvel. When Jeph Loeb became a writer and co-executive producer on the NBC TV series Heroes, Tim Sale's artwork would be featured on the show. Beyond his collaborations with Jeph Loeb, Tim Sale also worked on Superman Confidential, Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Tales of the Slayers, and Tales of the Batman: Tim Sale. He provided covers for The Foot Soldiers no. 3, Adventures of Superman no 597, Batgirl no. 21, Detective Comics no. 763, Harley Quinn no. 13, JSA no. 29, The Spectre no. 10, Flinch no. 5, El Diablo no. 1-4, Queen & Country no. 1-4, Detective Comics no. 777-796, Batgirl no. 69-73, and various issues of Batman vol 3. Tim Sale was one of the greatest comic book artists to emerge in the past few decades. His style was different from anyone else in the industry and immediately identifiable. His style was tight and he often made use of strong contrasts between light and dark in his work. He was not afraid to use caricature from time to time in his art. More than anything else, Tim Sale's art emphasized the characters and moved the story forward. In some respects his artwork was more reminiscent of painting than traditional comic book artwork. Tim Sale was well loved by his fellow comic book creators, and his fans as well. He was known for his kindness and friendliness to his fans, and many left conventions with sketches he had done. If so many comic book professionals and fans are mourning Tim Sale, it's not simply because he was a great artist. It is because he was a great man."},
{"title": "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars", "date": "Thursday, June 16, 2022", "text": "It was fifty years ago today that David Bowie's album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars was released. While David Bowie's preceding album Hunky Dory reached no. 3 on the British album chart, many count The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars as his breakthrough album. Since its release it has ranked on various lists of the greatest albums of all time. In 1987 Rolling Stone ranked it at no. 6 on its list of \"The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years.\" In 2003 Rolling Stone would rank it The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars at no. 35th in their list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\" Publications from Pitchfork to Q to Time to NME have ranked it among the best albums ever made. The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars would certainly have a lasting influence. The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is a concept album, if a somewhat loose one. In the reality of the album, a news network reports that Earth has only five more years left before it is destroyed by an apocalypse. It is in this milieu that that alien rock star Ziggy Stardust comes to Earth. Along with his  his backing band The Spiders from Mars, he delivers a message of hope that Earth will be saved by an alien Starman (hence the title of the song of the same name). He also becomes a superstar with a legion of fans. Unfortunately, Ziggy's ego gets the better of him and he ultimately finds himself driving away his bandmates and alienating his fans. In the end, his ego and fame cost him his life. The character of Ziggy Stardust was inspired by a number of different sources. including English rock and roll singer Vince Taylor, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Marc Bolan, and the Legendary Stardust Cowboy. Recording on The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars began only a few months after recording sessions for David Bowie's previous album, Hunky Dory, had ended. The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars retained David Bowie's backing band from Hunky Dory, consisting of Mick Ronson on guitar, Trevor Bolder on bass, and  Mick Woodmansey on drums. Ken Scott, who had produced Hunky Dory with David Bowie, would also serve as the producer on The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Like Hunky Dory, it was recorded at Trident Studios in London. It would be after David Bowie's return from a promotional tour of the United States in February 1971 that he wrote a number of songs at Haddon Hall in London that would appear on both Hunky Dory and The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. David Bowie's cover of the Ron Davies song \"It Ain't Easy,\" which would appear on The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars was recorded while they were still recording Hunky Dory, on July 9 1971. It would not be included on Hunky Dory, but would find its way onto The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. It was on November 8 1971 that recording officially began on the album. Recording continued until November 15 1971, when the band took a break for the holidays. They returned to the studio in January 1972 where the band worked on \"Suffragette City\"and \"\"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide.\" After RCA executive Dennis Katz complained that the album contained no songs that could be released as a single. It was then that the song \"Starman\" replaced  a cover of Chuck Berry's song \"Around and Around,\" retitled \"Round and Round\" on the album. It was on February 4 1972 that the album was finished, with \"Starman,\" \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide,\" and \"Suffragette City\" recorded on that day.Even though The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is a concept, most of the album's concept was not fleshed out until after it had been recorded. Indeed, as late as December 15 1971, the album still bore the title Round and Round. Given this, it should come as no surprise that some of the songs were written before work began on The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. \"Moonage Daydream\" was written during David Bowie's promotional tour of the United States in February 1971. \"Hang On to Yourself\" was also written in early 1971. Even \"Ziggy Stardust\" and \"Lady Stardust\" date back to early 1971. It is well known that \"Suffragette City\" was meant for another band entirely. David Bowie offered both \"All the Young Dudes\" and \"Suffragette City\" to Mott the Hoople. Mott the Hoople took \"All the Young Dudes,\" but turned down \"Suffragette City.\" \"Suffragette City\" was then recorded by David Bowie and the Spiders from Mars and became one of the highlights of the album.The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars would take glam rock places it never had before. As Barney Hoskyns wrote in a 2021 retrospective about the album in The Independent,  as Ziggy Stardust, David Bowie, \"...took glam rock to places that the Sweet only had nightmares about.\" The album ultimately covered such topics as drug use, sexuality, politics, the apocalypse, and the artifice of rock 'n' roll. And while The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars has often been counted as glam rock and even, in retrospect, proto-punk, the album embraced a wide array of musical styles. The styles used on the album range from 1950s rock 'n' roll, jazz, heavy metal, and proto-punk. David Bowie himself compared the album to the music of Iggy Pop. Influences on the album ranged from Little Richard to Eddie Cochran to Elton John to The Velvet Underground. Upon its release The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars received several positive reviews from critics. The 1972 review of the album in Circus stated, \"Someday in the far future when armed guides are leading interplanetary tourists through the ruins of Western society, perhaps they'll also be touting chrome statuettes of David Bowie - the young man from England who, if it may not be said that he saw it coming, at least was heard to cry 'Look out!'\"Jack Lloyd wrote in The Philadelphia Inquirer, \"David Bowie is one of the most creative, compelling writers around today.\" The review in Beat Instrumental Magazine ended with the line, \"Definitely an album for every serious rock fan. A taste of things to come.\" The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars proved to be successful on the charts. It peaked at no. 5 on the British album chart. In the United States it only went to no. 75 on the Billboard Top LPs and Tape chart, but then it must be considered that David Bowie's previous albums (including Hunky Dory, a hit in the UK) had failed to reach the Billboard chart in the United States. The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars has had a lasting influence. As mentioned earlier, it is consistently ranked on lists of the greatest albums of all time. It would prove to have a impact on a wide array of artists, from Bauhaus to  The Cure to Chris Cornell of Soundgarden to Fall Out Boy. Fans might argue about which album is David Bowie's best, but The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is definitely the one that put him on the map."},
{"title": "The Radio Show Command Performance", "date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2022", "text": "Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and Judy Garland during the episode Dick Tracy in B-Flat.Command Performance was one of the best known and most respected radio shows of the 1940s. Despite this, many Americans at home never heard an episode. This was because Command Performance aired on the Armed Forces Radio Network and by shortwave to the troops serving overseas during and after World War II. The show began as a result of a request from the United States War Department to Louis G. Cowan, then working in their radio division, to create a radio show to entertain the troops serving overseas. Prior to the war, Mr. Cowan had helped Kay Kyser develop his radio show Kay Kyser's Kollege of Musical Knowledge, and  created the popular radios show Quiz Kids. For the War Department Louis Cowan conceived a show that would based on requests from servicemen and servicewomen serving in World War II. It is for this reason that the show was titled Command Performance. The requests made by members of military for Command Performance varied a good deal. Among the requests were such things as Charles Laughton teaching Disney cartoon character Donald Duck elocution and Bing Crosby mixing bourbon and soda for Bob Hope. Others were a bit more unusual, such as hearing Carole Landis sigh and Ann Miller tap dancing in combat boots. Other service members simply wanted to hear sounds from home. One soldier wanted to hear his dog back home barking. An serviceman from Indiana wanted to hear the birds chirping in his home town. In its earliest days Command Performance was transmitted via shortwave, which proved to have its disadvantages. Many in the service had no access to  a shortwave radios. Another problem with shortwaving the show is that often reception was poor, with a lot of static and fading. It was for that reason that Command Performance was then recorded on 16\" transcription discs and shipped to Armed Forces Network stations overseas. The performers who appeared on Command Performance reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood and radio. The Andrew Sisters, Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Bob Hope, Lena Horne, Kay Kyser, Ginger Rogers, Frank Sinatra, Lana Turner, and yet others appeared on Command Performance. Any other radio show would have had to have paid a good deal of money for such talent, but the many legendary performances who appeared on Command Performance did so for free. NBC and CBS volunteered use of their network studios for recording the show for free as well. It is estimated that $75,000 would have been necessary to produce a similar show. In the beginning Command Performance originated from New York City, but it later moved to Hollywood where it would have better access to the stars of the big screen. It was recorded live in front of an audience made up of members of the military. Because it was recorded to transcription discs, many more episodes of Command Performance survive than episodes of other radio shows. Only one episode would ever air stateside. It was on Christmas Eve in 1942 that Command Performance was broadcasted to radio listeners at home in the United States. That episode featured Fred Allen, The Andrew Sisters, Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen, Bing Crosby, Harriet Hilliard,  Spike Jones and The City Slickers, Kay Kyser, Charles Laughton, Dinah Shore, Ginny Simms, Red Skelton, and Ethel Waters.Perhaps the most notable episode of Command Performance was its February 15 1945 broadcast. It featured the 55 minute parody operetta Dick Tracy in B-Flat: For goodness sakes isn't he ever going to marry Tess Trueheart!. It starred Bing Crosby as Dick Tracy, with Dinah Shore as Tess Trueheart, Bob Hope as Flattop, Cass Daley as Gravel Gertie, Frank Sinatra as Shaky, Judy Garland as Snowflake Falls, The Andrew Sisters as The Summer Sisters, Frank Morgan as Vitamin Flintheart, Jerry Colonna as Chief Brandon, Harry Von Zell as Judge Hooper, and Jimmy Durante as The Mole. The AFRS Orchestra was conducted by Meredith Wilson, who would later become famous for The Music Man. No one loved Dick Tracy in B-Flat more than Dick Tracy's creator, Chester Gould. Command Performance debuted on March 1 1942. It began airing via the Armed Forces Radio Network after it was launched on May 26 1942. It would continue even after the war, until December 20 1949. It  was cancelled, along with nine other AFRS shows (including the popular series Mail Call), due to budget cuts.While Command Performance had ended its run, it was not forgotten. Many veterans who served during and shortly after World War II would remember the show. The existence of the show's many transcription discs would ensure that it would survive for further generations. Indeed, episodes of the show are available at such venues as the Internet Archive and YouTube, and CD collections of episodes can be bought from various Old Time Radio outlets. Command Performance was a remarkable achievement in radio, a program featuring the best talent of the time and written by top writers. What is more, they did all of it for free."},

Throughout his career he played a variety of roles, everything from clergymen to military officers to police officers to criminals. In Hard Eight he shined as professional gambler Sydney who takes a homeless man under his wing. Perhaps his most memorable guest appearance was in the Seinfeld episode \"The Library,\" in which he played dogged library investigations officer Lt. Joe Bookman, who confronts Jerry about having not returned Tropic of Cancer for twenty years. Philip Baker Hall was even good when a particular movie or TV show wasn't. Hit Me is not a particularly good movie, but Mr. Hall still gave a stellar performance as gangster Lenny Ish. So versatile was Philip Baker Hall that he did equally well in comedies and dramas. It is no wonder that Philip Baker Hall was so prolific. His talent was so great that he was very much in demand."},
{"title": "The 100th Birthday of Judy Garland", "date": "Friday, June 10, 2022", "text": "Judy Garland was born Frances Ethel Gumm 100 years ago today, on June 10 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Her parentswere vaudevillians who settled down to run a movie and vaudeville theatre. The family moved to Lancaster, California where young Frances Ethel Gumm and her sisters began their career in entertainment as the Gumm Sisters. The Gumm Sisters proved relatively successful. They toured the vaudeville circuit and appeared in short films. The Gumm Sisters would eventually become the Garland Sisters, with Frances Ethel Gumm taking the first name \"Judy.\" It was in 1935, after Suzanne Garland (born Mary Jane Gumm) got married, that the Garland Sisters broke up as an act. It was that same year that Judy Garland would be signed to MGM. Four years later she was catapulted to superstardom in The Wizard of Oz (1939).Judy Garland remains one of the most famous stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood, as well as one of the most beloved. In their list of the Greatest Female Stars of All-Time, the American Film Institute ranked eighth, and one has to suspect many would have ranked her much higher. Indeed, she has been called \"the World's Greatest Entertainer.\" Many of her movies, including The Wizard of Oz (1939), Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), and A Star is Born (1954), are counted among the greatest movies of all time. Many of the songs she originated in movies, including \"Over the Rainbow,\" \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\" and \"The Man That Got Away,\" have become standards. One hundred years after her birth, Judy Garland is still a superstar.While Judy Garland made many films in her career, it seems likely that much of her continued fame is due to one film: The Wizard of Oz. Contrary to popular belief, The Wizard of Oz did do well at the box office (it was the fifth highest grossing film of 1939), it was simply a case that its production costs and other costs were so high that it did not make a profit. It certainly did well in its re-releases. More than its several re-releases to theatres, it was perhaps its annual airings on television that contributed most to Judy Garland's fame. It first aired on television on Ford Star Jubilee in 1956. Starting in 1959, The Wizard Oz would air annually on network television until 1996. Since then it still airs regularly on Turner Classic Movies, TNT, and TBS, and is available on streaming as well. It is largely because of its annual airings on broadcast network television that many estimate The Wizard of Oz is the most viewed film in history. Indeed, it seems likely that because of the annual airings of The Wizard of Oz, not only is it the first classic film many younger Baby Boomers and the entirety of Generation X and the Millennials ever saw, making Judy Garland the first classic movie star to whom they were exposed. Of course, The Wizard of Oz was not the only Judy Garland movie that would air regularly on television. Meet Me in St. Louis would air on many stations on a regular basis, particularly at Christmas time. Easter Parade would be an annual Easter event for many local stations. It seems likely that a good swathe of Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, and Millennials were all exposed to Judy Garland well before they turned 18.Of course, even with annual airings of The Wizard of Oz, Judy Garland would not have remained popular had it not been for her enormous talent. As an actress she was capable of displaying a wide range of emotions, not simply in her words but also in her expressions and body language. She was ideally suited to comedy and musicals, but she was capable of playing drama as well. Judy Garland was as good in Judgement at Nuremberg as she was Meet Me in St. Louis. Judy Garland was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress for A Star is Born (an Oscar many believe she should have won) and Best Supporting Actress for Judgement at Nuremberg. Judy Garland was also a fairly good dancer, displaying her talent in many musicals. As great an actress as Judy Garland was, it can be argued that she was an even better singer. Miss Garland was blessed with a powerful contralto over which she had perfect control. What is more, while singing Judy Garland could imbue her voice with a multitude of emotions. It is little wonder that \"Over the Rainbow\" would be counted by the American Film Institute as the greatest movie song of all time. When discussing Judy Garland's popularity, her status as a gay icon really cannot be ignored. It seems likely she was already a gay icon before she died. More one than writer at the time noted a disproportionate number of her fans present at her 1967 engagement at the Palace Theatre in New York City were gay. As a heterosexual cisgendered male, I am not sure I can entirely explain how or why Judy Garland became a gay icon, but I think part of the reason may also be why she remains popular with audiences in general. Both in her films and in life Judy Garland was something of an outsider. In The Wizard of Oz, she played Dorothy Gale, a young woman who longs for life beyond the confines of her aunt and uncle's Kansas farm. She played a small town girl aspiring to dreams on Broadway in Presenting Lily Mars (1943). In The Harvey Girls (1946) it is Judy Garland's character Susan who leads the fight against Judge Sam Purvis's (Preston Foster)campaign to drive the Harvey Girls away to keep the town's saloon thriving. In real life Judy Garland was a bit of an outsider as well. While there is no doubt that Judy Garland is and was a star, she never fit neatly into the categories into which the studios liked to place actresses. Although she was very attractive, Judy Garland was never counted as a great beauty and she was never counted as a glamour girl. Although she was a great actress, she was never counted among such enormous talents as Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn. In many ways Judy Garland stood apart from the Hollywood mainstream. Anyone who does not feel as if they fit into mainstream society, whether because of sexual orientation or some other reason, will probably feel some affection for Judy Garland for that reason.Of course, Judy Garland would have an enormous impact on many. For me, The Wizard of Oz was the first classic film I can remember watching and as a result Judy Garland was the first classic movie star of whom I was aware. Judy Garland and The Wizard of Oz could then be counted as the start of my journey as a classic movie buff. By the time I was an adult I had already seen many of her movies, including Meet Me in St, Louis and A Star is Born. Judy Garland would have an even bigger impact on my dear friend Vanessa Marquez. It was after she saw The Wizard of Oz for the first time when she was three or four that she decided she wanted to be an actress when she grew up. The list of other celebrities inspired by Miss Garland is not a short one: Bete Midler, Freddie Mercury, Donna Summer, Janelle Monae, and many others. Judy Garland has had a lasting impact on pop culture and there can be no doubt she will continue to do so for the next 100 years."},
{"title": "Victim (1961)", "date": "Thursday, June 9, 2022", "text": "Although it may not be well known among the general public now, Victim (1961) was groundbreaking upon its release. Directed by Basil Dearden and starring Dirk Bogarde, it was pioneering in its approach to homosexuality. In fact, it was the first English language film in which the word \"homosexual\" was mentioned.Victim centred on Melville Farr (Dirk Bogarde), a successful barrister who is on the verge of becoming a Queen's Counsel. Farr also happens to be gay. Jack \"Boy\" Barrett (Peter McEnery), a young man with whom Farr had a romantic, if platonic relationship, was being blackmailed. To play the blackmail he stole  £2,300 from his job and as a result is being pursued by the police. He wants Farr's help in leaving the country. Unfortunately for Barrett, he is picked up by the police, who wants to know why he was being blackmailed. Barrett ultimately hangs himself in a police cell to avoid revealing the reason why he was being blackmailed and compromising Farr as well. Farr then decides to take on the ring of blackmailers himself.Victim emerged from the social and political climate in the United Kingdom at the time. The  Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 had made homosexual acts between men illegal. It was after the end of the Second World War that arrests and prosecutions for violating for homosexual offences had increased dramatically. Following the convictions of such high profile men as John Gielgud,  Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, Peter Wildeblood and others, that the government set up a committee within  Home Office and Scottish Home Department  to examine homosexual offences and prostitution. The  Report of the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution was published on September 4 1957, and is often called the Wolfenden report after  Sir John Wolfenden, the chairman of the committee. The report ultimately recommended that \"homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence.\"Janet Green, the screenwriter who had written such films as Eyewitness (1956) and Sapphire (1959), read the Wolfenden report and as a result took in the reform of the laws regarding homosexuality. She and her husband John McCormick then wrote a screenplay originally titled Boy Barrett. Janet Green had previously worked with director Basil Dearden and produce Michael Relph on Sapphire, and the two men decided to forward with Victim. They decided to take an approach to Victim similar to that they took with Sapphire, which addressed racism against Afro-Caribbean immigrants in London.Basil Dearden and Michael Relph would have some difficulty finding their leading man. Victim was offered to Jack Hawkins, but he turned it down. An offer was made to James Mason, but he turned it down as well. Even Stewart Granger was considered for the lead role. Finally, Victim was offered to Dirk Bogarde, then one of the United Kingdom's top matinee idols. He had starred in the successful Doctor series of films, as well as such movies as The Blue Lamp (1950), Cast a Dark Shadow (1955), and A Tale of Two Cities (1958). What was not well known at the time was that Dirk Bogarde was gay himself. He lived with his partner, Anthony Forward, and the two men would remain together until Mr. Forward died in 1988. Given homosexual acts were illegal in the United Kingdom at the time, as well as the possible adverse affect a revelation that he was gay could have upon his career, it should come as no surprise that Mr. Bogarde hid his sexual orientation for years.In making Victim producer Michael Relph made the decision to approach the subject of homosexuality very cautiously. It was decided that the movie would feature no discussion of sexual acts between men, let alone scenes addressing sexual relations between men. That having been said, the movie approached homosexuality with sympathy, something that was somewhat revolutionary at the time. Michael Relph ultimately said that  Victim was a story of \"not glands, but of love.\"Even without any mention of homosexual acts, let alone any portrayal of such, Victim ran afoul of censors on both sides of the Pond. The British Board of Film Censorship (BBFC) demanded four lines of dialogue be cut, and suggested shortening two other scenes. Even so, the BBFC would ultimately give Victim an \"X\" certificate, which meant no one under the age of 16 could see the film. At the time \"X\" certificates were generally given to only adult films and horror movies. The Production Code Administration in the Unites States would have a much stronger reaction to Victim. Quite simply the PCA refused to give Victim its seal of approval. Victim was released in the United States without the PCA's seal. While Victim proved controversial with the censors, it did receive positive reviews in the United Kingdom and the United States. Seen today Victim seems dated. Farr and Barrett never had sex, nor does Farr ever mention having had sex with any other man. In fact, there is no mention of sexual relations between men at any point in the film. The photograph for which Barrett being blackmailed is not one of him en flagrante with another man, but a simple photo of Barrett crying on Farr's shoulder. While Victim was certainly groundbreaking at the time, today its approach to homosexuality seems prudish. Of course, as pointed out above, this approach was intentional. Producer Michael Relph knew better than to push the envelope too far with regards to the censors.Regardless, Victim was a groundbreaking film in addressing the topic of homosexuality directly in a way that it never had before. It also proved to be a turning point in Dirk Bogarde's career. Previously and with but a few exceptions, Mr. Bogarde had been confined to roles befitting his status as a matinee idol. Afterwards he would appear in such films as The Servant (1963), Darling (1965), Death in Venice (1971), and yet others. Although Victim might appear dated today, at the time it was a positively revolutionary film."},

It would remain no. 1 on the chart for three weeks. It peaked at no. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Ultimately, \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" would sell over 10 million copies worldwide.A promotional film for \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" was shot at the ruins of Witley Court in Worcestershire, England. It was directed by Peter Clifton, who would go onto direct the Led Zeppelin concert film The Song Remains the Same (1976). Better known than the promotional film for \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" is perhaps the film made for Scopitone visual jukeboxes. The members of Procol Harum in the  Scopitone film does not reflect the actual personnel who had worked on the song \"A Whiter Shade of Pale.\" Drums on the song were provided by session drummer Bill Evden, who did not appear in the original promotional film either. Guitarist Ray Royer had left Procol Harum and been replaced by Robin Trower by the time the Scopitone film was shot. The Scopitone film was shot in and around London.Without further ado, here is the Scopitone film of \"A Whiter Shade of Pale.\""},

{"title": "The 18th Anniversary of A Shroud of Thoughts", "date": "Saturday, June 4, 2022", "text": "If A Shroud of Thoughts was a human being, it would be old enough to vote. It was 18 years ago today that I made my first post on this blog. At the time I started A Shroud of Thoughts, I did not expect that I would still be writing it eighteen years and 4264 posts later. I also did not expect the many changes to my life that A Shroud of Thoughts would make to my life. I have made many close friends through writing A Shroud of Thoughts. My first book would even largely be compiled of posts from this blog. I have never made any money writing this blog, but I do think in some ways it has become my life's work.As to the origins of A Shroud of Thoughts, in the mid-Naughts blogs were something of a fad. I had a lady friend at the time who had her own blog and it looked like fun, so I decided to start my own. As to the title, at the time it was fashionable for blogs to have names containing the word \"thoughts\" or something similar like \"musings\" and so on. I then settled on the phrase \"a shroud of thoughts\" from Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage canto iii stanza 113 (I won't quote here, as over the years I think I have quoted it enough). I have to admit that I have since regretted it. Since the blog very quickly evolved from a general interest blog to a blog devoted to pop culture, nostalgia, classic movies, classic films, Old Time Radio, classic comic books, and pulp magazines, I think perhaps I should have chosen a  more fitting name! Unfortunately, by the time I realized I should have chosen a better name than A Shroud of Thoughts, the blog already had a readership and I thought it would confuse people if I changed the name. If 18 years seems very old for blog, I can tell you that in many ways it is not unusual.  Immortal Ephemera is older than this blog, dating to 2002. Inner Toob is about a month and a half older, starting in April 2004. Both The Stop Button and Laura's Miscellaneous Musings go back to 2005. The Rap Sheet dates to 2006. My friend Raquel started Out of the Past in 2007.And these aren't the only blogs that are well over ten years old out there. While most blogs won't last one year, it's not as unusual for a blog to last well over a decade as one might think.Sadly, some of my fellow long time bloggers are no longer with us. Steve Bailey, who ran the blog MovieMovieBlogBlog died last fall. His death took me entirely by surprise. He was only a little older than me, although his health was not particularly good. Steve had a wonderfully twisted sense of humour and he was active in many blogathons. He was a huge fan of The Beatles and perhaps the biggest Jane Russell fan I ever knew. It was on March 7, only three days before my birthday, that beloved blogger Patricia Nolan-Hall, known to her friends as Paddy Lee, died. In the classic film and television blogging community, I don't think anyone was more loved than Paddy. She not only posted to her blog Caftan Woman often, but she read a large number of blogs and more often than not commented on them. She was participated in many blogathons. Paddy was warm and approachable, a ray of sunlight even when the world seemed dark. I miss both Steve and Paddy immensely, and thinking of both of them still brings tears to my eyes.Anyway, I would like to think those of you who have continued to read this blog over the years.

{"title": "They Call Me Trinity (1970)", "date": "Friday, June 3, 2022", "text": "(This post is part of the Foreign Western Blogathon hosted by Moon Over Gemini)When people think of Spaghetti Westerns, such grim, ultraviolent movies with morally ambiguous protagonists as A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Sabata (1969) most likely come to mind. While it is most definitely a Spaghetti Western, about the only thing They Call Me Trinity has in common with those movies are a morally ambiguous protagonist. Quite simply, They Call Me Trinity, or in its native Italian Lo chiamavano Trinità (literally \"They call me Trinity\") is a Spaghetti Western comedy.They Call Me Trinity centres on the character of the title (Terence Hill), a gunfighter with preternatural skill with guns wandering the Old West. While Trinity is an excellent gunslinger and quite good at hand to hand combat, he also happens to be exceedingly lazy, so lazy that he has a litter attached to his horse on which he takes naps while his horse takes them to wherever he wants to go. Trinity finds himself in a small Western town where his brother Bambino (Bud Spencer) just happens to be impersonating the local sheriff while he waits for his gang, just escaped from prison, to arrive. Bambino is not particularly happy to see Trinity, as one of Trinity's few talents is causing trouble. As it turns out, Trinity is taken with a pair of young, single women from the local Mormon settlement. This puts him into conflict with the corrupt Major Harriman (Farley Granger), who wants to drive the Mormons from their land so he can use it for pasture for his horses. Trinity and Bambino then must form an uneasy alliance despite their differences.For much of the Sixties, Spaghetti Westerns had proven to be very successful. The genre reached its peak in 1968 when fully one-third of all films produced in Italy were Spaghetti Westerns. The bottom would fall out of the genre by 1969, when Spaghetti Westerns comprised only one tenth of all films produced in Italy. It was perhaps for that reason that producer Italo Zingarelli asked director Enzo Barboni to write a script for a Western comedy. Given the time, Mr. Zingarelli was probably wise in doing so. In the Sixties such Western comedies produced by Hollywood as McLintock! (1963), Cat Ballou (1965), and Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969) had seen success. As to director Enzo Barboni, he had already directed a serious Western, The Unholy Four (1970). Originally Peter Martell and George Eastman were to be cast as the leads in They Call Me Trinity. It was director Enzo Barboni who cast Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. The two first appeared on screen together in the movie Hannibal (1959), but not as a team. It was the Spaghetti Western God Forgives...I Don't (1967) that established Terence Hill and Bud Spencer as a team. While God Forgives...I Don't! is a serious Spaghetti Western, it has its comic moments, particularly in scenes in which Terence Hill and Bud Spencer were together. God Forgives...I Don't would prove so successful that Terence Hill and Bud Spencer would reprise their characters in Ace High (1968) and Boot Hill (1969). As in the case of God Forgives...But I Don't!, both Ace High and Boot Hill were serious films, but with a bit of comedy thrown in for good measure.  Incredibly, both Terence Hill and Bud Spencer would perform their own stunts in They Call Me Trinity, with stuntmen mostly performing the stunts for the supporting cast.While it is a comedy, one thing that They Call Me Trinity has in common with other Spaghetti Westerns is that it was shot in Europe. In the case of They Call Me Trinity, it was shot in Italy. Interiors and towns were shot at Incir De Paolis Studios in Rome. Campo Imperatore in Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park served as the Mormons' field that the Major wanted. Other locations were shot around Lazio, the province in which Rome is located.They Call Me Trinity proved to be a hit upon its release in Italy. In fact, it was so successful that as of 2004 it was the 22nd most successful Italian film, right below fellow Spaghetti Western The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966). They Call Me Trinity also did well elsewhere in the world, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The success of They Call Me Trinity would lead to a sequel, Trinity is Still My Name (1971), which proved to be even more successful than They Call Me Trinity. Its success would also lead to several more films teaming Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, from Blackie the Pirate (1971) to Troublemakers (1994). As might be expected given the nature of Italian cinema, several derivative films were released in the wake of They Call Me Trinity, including They Call Me Hallalujah (1971), Two Sons of Trinity (1972), Cambonia! (1974), and yet others. The success of They Call Me Trinity also led to a boom in Spaghetti Western comedies that would last until Spaghetti Westerns faded from view in the mid to late Seventies.Sadly, They Call Me Trinity has been blamed for the many inferior Spaghetti Western comedies that followed, with some even maintaining that They Call Me Trinity marked the beginning of the end for the Spaghetti Western. While They Call Me Trinity certainly did inspire a number of inferior imitators, it did so because it is a very funny movie. Indeed, Howard Thompson wrote in The New York Times \"Whoever E. B. Clucher (director Enzo Barbonis's pseudonym.--Terence) is—and he is credited as writer-director of yesterday's new movie, \"They Call Me Trinity\"—he has a sense of humour.\"  They Call Me Trinity is primarily a slapstick comedy, with the emphasis on physical gags. In some respects it is not unlike an extended Laurel and Hardy short set in the Old West, given a few tropes from Spaghetti Westerns, and shot in Italy. Because of this it translates well around much of the world. Languages may vary from country to country, but physical humour remains mostly the same. It must also be pointed out that Terence Hill and Bud Spencer are perfect in their roles. At any rate, to blame They Call Me Trinity for the many inferior Spaghetti Western comedies that followed it would be something like blaming Star Wars (1977) for the many bad sci-fi movies that followed in its wake.In the end, whether They Call Me Trinity led to the demise of the Spaghetti Western is perhaps moot. It remains one of the funniest Western comedies shot anywhere in the world."},
{"title": "Alan White of Yes and Andy Fletcher of Depeche Mode Pass On", "date": "Thursday, June 2, 2022", "text": "Alan WhiteAlan White, drummer and longest serving member of Yes, died on May 29 2022 at the age of 72 following a brief illness.Alan White was born on June 14 1949 in Pelton, County Durham. Music ran in his family. His grandfather was a pianist and his uncle was a drummer. When he was seven the family moved to Ferryhill, County, Durham. Alan White was six year old when he began taking piano lessons. His uncle noticed that young Alan White played the piano as if it were a percussion instrument, and told his parents. When Alan White was twelve, his parents then gave him an Ajax drum kit for Christmas. Eventually his parents would buy him a large Ludwig drum kit.Alan White was only thirteen when he joined his first band, The Downbeats, who largely played covers of such beat bands as The Beatles, The Searchers, and Gerry & The Pacemakers. In 1964 The Downbeats changed their name to The Blue Chips. As The Blue Chips they went to 'London where they competed in a talent contest. They won the contest, which included a monetary award, new equipment, and a recording contract. The Blue Chips released the singles \"I'm on the Right Side,\" \"Some Kind of Lovin',\" and \"Tell Her\" in 1965 and 1966, but none of them charted. The Blue Chips soon broke up afterwards.Alan White went onto play as part of Billy Fury's band The Gamblers. Afterwards he joined The Happy Magazine. The band released a few singles before being renamed Griffin. Grffin would record only one single before they broke up. Alan White also played with The Alan Price Set and appeared on their albums A Price on His Head and The Price is Right.It was in 1969 that Alan White was invited by John Lennon to play with The Plastic Ono Band when performed at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival.  He also appeared on John Lennon's single \"Instant Karma\" and on his album Imagine. He would later play on George Harrison's album All Things Must Pass and Radha Krsna Temple. He later worked with Denny Laine's band Bails and Ginger Baker's Air Force, as well as working with Steve Winwood and Terry Reid.It was when Yes's drummer Bill Bruford left the band to join King Crimson that Alan White became Yes's drummer. He first appeared on Yes's album Yessongs and ultimately played on over forty Yes studio albums and live albums. He also co-wrote various Yes songs, including \"Turn of the Century\" from Going for the One; \"Future Times\" and \"Release, Release\" from Tormato; and  \"Changes,\" \"Our Song,\" and \"Hearts\" from 90125. Ultimately, Alan White would become the longest standing member of Yes and the only member besides Chris Squire to have never left the band.Alan White released only one solo album,  Ramshackled in 1976. He appeared solo projects by fellow Yes members Chris Squire, Steve Howe, and Rick Wakeman. He also worked with Gary Wright, Jesse Davis, Donovan, Eddie Harris, and Johnny Harris.Alan White was arguably one of the best drummers of his era. He had impeccable timing. What is more he was capable of a variety of drumming styles, insuring that he could play with artists as diverse as prog rockers Yes to jazz musician Eddie Harris. His versatility also allowed him to keep pace with Yes's changing styles over the years. When it came to drummers in progressive rock, Alan White was one of the best.Andy FletcherAndy Fletcher, keyboardist and founding member of Depeche Mode, died on May 29 2022 at the age of 60.Andy Fletcher was born on July 8 1961 in Nottingham. His first two years of life were spent in Basildon before the family moved to Nottingham. It was in 1977 that Andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke formed a band called No Romance in China. It was later in 1980 that Andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke formed another band, this one called Composition of Sound. Vince Clarke played guitar and sang, while Andy Fletcher played bass. It would after Vince Clarke heard the band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark that Messrs. Clarke and Fletcher decided to shift to electronic music. Martin Gore then joined the band. Still later Dave Gahan joined Composition of Sound. It was Dave Gahan who suggested a new name for the band Depeche Mode. They are believed to have first played under that name at the James Hornsby School in Basildon. Depeche Mode's first single, \"Dreaming of Me,\" was released on Mute Records in 1981. It would be their second single, \"New Life,\" that would be their first hit, peaking at no. 11 on the UK singles chart. With Martin Gore and Dave Gahan, Andy Fletcher would be one the three members of Depeche Mode who remained with the band from its beginning. While Messrs Gore and Gahan both wrote songs, Andy Fletcher's precise role in the band was a bit of a running joke. He once joked in a Rolling Stone interview,  \"Martin's the songwriter, Alan's the good musician, Dave's the vocalist, and I bum around.\" In truth, Andy Fletcher played an important role in Depeche Mode. Early on, he played bass and still later synth bass. Later he would play the synthesizer, using it both for music and sound effects. Also, since it was often the case that Depeche Mode did not have a manager, Andy Fletcher handle much of the band's business. He was also pivotal in settling disputes within the band. Quite simply, he was the glue that kept the band together.In addition to his work with Depeche Mode, Andy Fletcher also founded his own label as an imprint of Mute Records, Toast Hawaii, in 2002. Whenever he was on hiatus from Depeche Mode, he sometimes played as a DJ at various clubs and festivals. Many were often puzzled by Andy Fletcher's role in Depeche Mode. Some even pondered whether or not his keyboards were plugged in when he was on stage. Aside from handling the band's business, as mentioned above, Andy Fletcher was the glue that held the band together. And his bandmates adored him. In their official statement on this death, they said in part, \"Fletch had a true heart of gold and was always there when you needed support, a lively conversation, a good laugh, or a cold pint.\" Depeche Mode's fans, many of who actually met him, loved Andy Fletcher as well. He was known for being both down to earth and very approachable. He was often known to talk to fans and even offer them a cigarette. He was a true gentlemen, one in an industry not often known for gentlemen."},
{"title": "The Late Great Ronnie Hawkins", "date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2022", "text": "Rock 'n' roll legend Ronnie Hawkins died on May 29 2022 at the age of 87 after a long illness.Ronnie Hawkins was born on January 10 1935 in Huntsville, Arkansas. His family moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas when he was young. He came from a family of musicians. Various uncles and cousins toured Arkansas and Oklahoma as \"The Hawkins Family\" in 1930s and 1940s. His uncle Delmar \"Skipper\" Hawkins performed with the Sons of the Pioneers. Delmar Hawkins's son Dale Hawkins had a music career contemporaneous with Ronnie Hawkins and had a hit in 1957 with the song \"Suzy Q.\" At age eleven Ronnie Hawkins started singing at local fairs. He formed his first band, The Hawks, after graduating high school. He attended the University of Arkansas, majoring in physical education, but dropped out in 1956 just a few credits shy of graduation.Afterwards Ronnie Hawkins enlisted in the United States Army. It was while he was in  Army Basic Combat Training at Fort Sill that he began performing with an African American quartet under the name The Black Hawks. The Black Hawks disbanded after Ronnie Hawkins's service in the army ended. He was not out of the military for long when he cut two demos, a cover of Lloyd Price's \"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\" and a cover of Hank Williams's \"A Mansion on the Hill.\" Unfortunately, nothing came of the demos. Despite this, Ronnie Hawkins impressed Luke Paulman, the session guitarist on the two demos, who made an offer to young Mr. Hawkins that they go to his home of Helena, Arkansas, where he could further pursue his music career. Once in Helena, Ronnie Hawkins formed the initial version of his band The Hawks with Luke Paulman, Luke Paulman's brother, bassist George Paulman, and their cousin, pianist Willard \"Pop\" Jones. It was later in 1957 that drummer Levon Helm joined the band. It was in 1958 that Conway Twitty suggested to Ronnie Hawkins that he tour Canada. Having met with little success in the United States, Ronnie Hawkins found success in Canada and would make the country his home. Except for drummer Levon Helm, the other members of The Hawks would not join Ronnie Hawkins in Canada. It was in 1959 that Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks signed a contract with Roulette Records. He would have his first hit with a cover of Chuck Berry's \"Thirty Days,\" retitled \"Forty Days.\" It went to no. 4 on the Canadian singles chart and peaked at no. 45 on the Billboard Hot 100. The B-side of \"Forty Days,\" a cover of Young Jessie's \"Mary Lou\" would prove to be his biggest hit in the United States. Peaking at no. 6 on the Canadian singles chart, it went to no. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100. While Ronnie Hawkins would see little success on the American Billboard Hot 100, he would continue to have hits on the Canadian singles chart. His covers of Bo Diddley's \"Bo Diddley\" and Ersel Hickey's \"Bluebirds over the Mountain\" reached the top ten of the Canadian singles chart. In 1970 his cover of The Clovers' \"Down in the Alley' peaked at no. 20 on the chart. Starting with his self-titled debut album in 1959, Ronnie Hawkins also released several albums throughout his career. With Fred Carter on guitar and Levon Helm on drums, Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson became the new incarnation of the Hawks. They would leave him in 1964 and form The Band. Over the years Ronnie Hawkins would prove to be a mentor to several rock musicians. In addition to The Band, he started the careers of guitarists Roy Buchanan and Pat Travers. The Band always acknowledged the debt they owed Ronnie Hawkins, and he performed at their farewell concert on Thanksgiving Day at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco in 1975, which was filmed for Martin Scorsese's documentary The Last Waltz (1978). Ronnie Hawkins was a pioneer of rock 'n' roll and an incredible performer. Much more of a live performer than a studio musician, he could give incredible performances. He was known for his racousness on stage, which included his camel walk and even back flips. Ronnie Hakwins was certainly influential on rock music in Canada. Over the years he was honoured in Canada with a star on the Canada Walk of Fame in Toronto, induction into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame, and an honorary degree from Laurentian University in Sudsbury, Ontario. He was made an Honorary Officer of the Order of Canada in 2014."},

{"title": "Daughter of Shanghai (1937)", "date": "Saturday, May 28, 2022", "text": "Philip Ahn & Anna May WongGood roles for East Asian Americans were uncommon during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Even a superstar like Anna May Wong could not overcome the various stereotypes about people of East Asian descent the film industry perpetuated during the era. In an era when yellowface was still common practice, it was not unusual for Anna May Wong to lose Chinese roles to white actresses. She lost the role of Lien Wha in The Son-Daughter (1932) to Helen Hayes. She lost the role of  O-lan in The Good Earth (1937) to Luise Rainer, who won an Oscar for the part. Sadly, for much of her career Anna May Wong would be cast in such roles as the \"Dragon Lady\" stereotype or the \"Butterfly\" stereotype.While Anna May Wong lost the role of O-lan in The Good Earth, it was in 1937 that her career somewhat improved. She signed to Paramount, who featured her in a series of B-movies. While these B-movies were sometimes dismissed by the critics of the day, they gave Anna May Wong the chance to play Chinese American roles that were not stereotypes and were regarded in the Chinese American press of the time as positive images of East Asian Americans. Significant among these movies is Daughter of Shanghai (1937), the second film Anna May Wong made for Paramount.In Daughter of Shanghai Anna May Wong plays Lan Ying Lin, the Chinese American daughter of a Chinese art dealer, Quan Lin (Lee Ching-Wah). When Quan Lin refuses to cooperate with criminals smuggling illegal aliens in to the United States, they kill him and attempt to kill Lan Ying Lin, who survives. Lan Ying Lin decides to take matters into her own hands and investigate the smugglers herself. Also investigating the smugglers is Chinese American FBI agent Kim Lee (Philip Ahn). The two eventually team up to take down the smuggling ring. As to why a movie centred on a Chinese American would be titled \"Daughter of Shanghai,\" there is an explanation for that in the movie.Daughter of Shanghai is historic in that it is one of the earliest American movies to feature two East Asian American leads. In some respects, Philip Ahn's career reflected that of Anna May Wong. Philip Ahn was a Korean American actor who also often had troubles finding good roles. Korean and Korean American roles being rare in Hollywood during the Golden Age of Hollywood, Philip Ahn often found himself playing Chinese American roles and later Japanese roles. His character Kim Lee in Daughter of Shanghai was not simply historic because it was a lead role, but also because it may well be the first portrayal of a Chinese American law enforcement officer in the history of American film. What is more, Kim Lee is not played as a stereotype at all, but an intelligent, resourceful FBI agent who speaks without an accent. Anna May Wong's character Lan Ying Lin is also portrayed with dignity and without any stereotypical traits. Indeed, it is to be noted that in Daughter of Shanghai not one East Asian role is played by a white person in yellowface. The Chinese American characters are all played by East Asian American actors.While most of Daughter of Shanghai was shot on the Paramount lot, the film is of interest to those who would like a look at San Francisco in the Thirties. Early in the movie there is an establishing shot of San Francisco's Chinatown in which the exterior of the Shanghai Low restaurant is visible.Daughter of Shanghai was released on December 17 1937 to largely positive reviews. It also did well at the box office. Paramount would follow Daughter of Shanghai up with Dangerous to Know (1938). Anna May Wong and Philip Ahn would be reunited in the 1939 film King of Chinatown, in which they once more played the leads. While Daughter of Shanghai is dated to some degree (on more than one occasion someone must come to Lan Ying Lin's aid), it holds up as a fine crime movie. Anna May Wong and Philip Ahn both give good performances, as do other members of the cast. And while Daughter of Shanghai was shot on a low budget, it still looks very good with impressive set design and some very fine costumes. Its plot has a good deal of excitement while at the same time avoiding the cliches of the genre.Daughter of Shanghai was a historic film in giving audiences two East Asian American leads  in roles that were far removed from the stereotypes so prevalent during the era. It also happens to be a very good film. It is for those reasons that it was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2006."},

No cause has been given.Ray Liotta was born on December 18 1954 in Newark, New Jersey. He was abandoned at an orphanage as an infant and was adopted by Mary and Alfred Liotta when he was six months. He grew up in Union, New Jersey. He did not want to be an actor growing up, but he was interested in sports and played baseball, basketball, and football. It was in his senior year at Union High School that the school's drama teacher asked him if he wanted to be in the school play. Ray Liotta agreed and his interest in acting began. He studied acting at the University of Miami and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1978. Mr. Liotta worked as a bartender on Broadway in New York City before he landed the role of Joey Perrini on the soap opera Another World. He remained with the show until 1981.

{"title": "Little Shop of Horrors (1960)", "date": "Thursday, May 26, 2022", "text": "This post is part of the The Cormanverse Blogathon hosted by Cinematic Catharsis and Realweedgiemidget ReviewsLittle Shop of Horrors (1960) remains one of the best known films directed by Roger Corman. Part of this may be due to the popular musical based upon the movie (itself later adapted as a film), but much of it may be due to the fact that it proved to be a surprise hit at the box office. Repeatedly aired on television since its release, it would also develop a cult following it maintains to this day. Little Shop of Horrors (1960) centres on Seymour Krelborn (Jonathan Haze), a meek clerk working in a florist shop owned by Gravis Mushnick (Mel Welles). Also working in the florist shop is Audrey Fulquard (Jackie Joseph),  the girl of Seymour's dreams. Inept and clumsy, Seymour is not a particularly good employee, but he manages to insure security in his job when he tells Mr. Mushnick about an unusual plant he has grown from seeds he bought from \"...Japanese gardener over on Central Avenue.\" Seymour named the plant \"Audrey Jr.,\" after his beloved Audrey. While unusual, the plant is also rather sickly, and Mr. Mushnick gives Seymour only one week to revive the plant or he is fired. Unfortunately, Seymour soon learns the plant requires blood. As Audrey Jr. gets more blood, the plant begins to thrive.   As one might expect given this is a horror movie, Audrey Jr. soon requires entire human beings, which Seymour hesitantly provides. By the way, Audrey Jr. also turns out to be sentient, very intelligent, and very demanding. Little Shop of Horrors (1960) is well known for the speed with which it was filmed. According to legend, the manger of Producer's Studio, where many of American International Pictures movies were filmed, told Roger Corman that another film was about to finish shooting and the sets would be left standing for a brief period. Roger Corman's brother Gene then bet him that he couldn't shoot a film in two days with those sets. Mel Welles, who played Mr. Mushnik in the film, claims there is no truth to this legend. Instead, while Little Shop of Horrors (1960) was shot on sets left over from another film, Roger Corman had another reason for shooting the movie so swiftly. On January 1 1960 residuals would have to paid to actors for all films made after that date. Roger Corman then wanted to shoot his next film before the start of the new year in order to avoid paying residuals. Regardless, Little Shop of Horrors was meant to be a follow up to Bucket of Blood and it was both planned and shot quickly. For Roger Corman's prospective new movie, screenwriter Charles B. Griffith proposed a plot in which a music critic becomes a vampire. Roger Corman turned that proposal down, and Mr. Griffith then proposed a plot in which a salad chef cooks up meals using his regular customers. Roger Corman pointed out that this would run into problems with the Production Code, which at the time strong disapproved of anything touching upon cannibalism. Charles B. Griffith then suggested a man-eating plant. Charles B. Giffrth wanted to write what would become Little Shop of Horrors as a horror comedy, but given the poor box office performance of Bucket of Blood, Roger Corman was initially against it. Fortunately, Mr. Griffith was able to convince Mr. Corman to do another horror comedy. Initially, what would become Little Shop of Horrors was titled The Passionate People Eater.Given how quickly Little Shop of Horrors (1960) was made, it should come as no surprise that the cast was filled by some actors who had regularly appeared in Roger Corman's movies. Roger Corman offered the role of Seymour to Dick Miller, but he turned it down as being too similar to his role in Bucket of Blood. He ultimately took the smaller role of florist shop customer Burson Fouch. The role of Seymour ultimately went to Jonathan Haze, who had already appeared in several of Roger Corman's movies Gunslinger (1956), Not of This Earth (1957), and Rock All Night (1957). Mel Welles, who was cast as Mr. Mushnick, had already appeared in such Roger Corman movies as Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957), The Undead (1957), and Rock All Night (1957). As hard as it might be to believe, Nancy Kulp (now best known as Jane Hathsway on The Beverly Hillbillies) was in the running for the role of Audrey that went to Jackie Joseph. Jonathan Herman Shaner, who played Oscar in Bucket of Blood, played the sadistic dentist Dr. Farb. Jack Nicholson played the role of masochistic dentist patient Wilbur Force. Of course he would go onto become a regular in Roger Corman's films. Screenwriter Charles B. Griffith provided the voice of Audrey Jr.  off screen as a reference for the actors. It was planned that his voice would be overdubbed with that of an actor later on. As it turned out, that never happened, so that in the completed film it is an uncredited Charles B. Griffith voicing Audrey Jr. As Roger Corman had planned, Little Shop of Horrors (1960) was shot very quickly. Roger Corman filmed the movie during the last week of December 1959. Rehearsals unfolded over three days, with principal photography taking only two days and one night. Three days were then spent on second unit work and pick up shots. The film was shot using three cameras running at the same time, a method of filming even then used on television sitcoms. The budget of Little Shop of Horrors (1960) was low even for Roger Corman. It only cost around $30,000.Initially, Roger Corman had difficulty finding distribution for Little Shop of Horrors (1960) because it was viewed by some exhibitors as anti-Semitic due to Mel Welles's portrayal of Mr. Mushnick, as well as the character of Siddie Shiva (Leola Wendorff). It was nine months after it was completed that Little Shop of Horrors was finally released. When American International Pictures picked up the American distribution rights for Mario Bava's Black Sabbath (1960), it was paired with Little Shop of Horrors (1960) on a double bill. Word of mouth then spread about Little Shop of Horrors (1960) and it would later be released on a double bill with AIP's Last Woman on Earth (1960).Roger Corman had little hope for the success of Little Shop of Horrors (1960) in its initial release and had even less hope of it doing well after its initial run in theatres. For that reason he did not bother to copyright the film and as a result it entered the public domain. Regardless, Little Shop of Horrors (1960) would only grow in reputation as the years passed, with the film being shown often on television. By 1982 the popularity of Little Shop of Horrors (1960) as such that a stage musical was produced Off-Off-Broadway before moving a few months later Off-Broadway. A movie adapted from the musical was released in 1986. Made cheaply and quickly, Little Shop of Horrors (1960) has maintained its reputation over the years. At Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 92% from twelve critics. Being in public domain, there are numerous VHS and DVD releases of varying quality. A restored version of the film, along with a colourized version, was released on DVD by Legend Films in 2006. Little Shop of Horrors (1960) was a film that Roger Corman thought would do poorly at the box office and would be forgotten quickly. For once, Roger Corman was wrong."},

That is, she was a radio star. Barbara Jean Wong appeared in several hours worth of radio shows during the era of Old Time Radio, everything from I Love a Mystery to Hallmark Playhouse.Barbara Jean Wong was a fourth generation Chinese American born on March 3 1924 in Los Angeles. Her parents, Thomas and Maye Wong, operated a produce market. She was only five years old when she first started performing on radio. At the time her long black hair was styled in ringlets, and as a result she became known as the Chinese Shirley Temple. She attended the Mar-Ken School for Professional Children, where one of her classmates was Mickey Rooney. Barbara Jean Wong's most significant role may well have been on the radio program The Cinnamon Bear. The Cinnamon Bear is what would later be termed on television a \"mini-series\" or \"limited series.\" It was meant to air six days a week from Thanksgiving to Christmas. The Cinnamon Bear centred on a pair of twins, Judy Barton (Barbara Jean Wong) and Jimmy Barton (Bobby La Manche) who journey to a magical world called \"Maybeland\" to retrieve the silver star that topped their family's Christmas tree. They are helped in their search by Paddy O'Cinnamon, also known as The Cinnamon Bear. The Cinnamon Bear first aired from November 26 and December 25 1937. It would be repeated most holiday seasons for literally years. It remains widely available to this day.Another notable role for Barbara Jean Wong was Amos's daughter Arbadella on Amos 'n' Andy. Arbadella appeared in several episodes of the show and would usually play a significant role in the Christmas episodes, in which Amos would explain the importance of Christmas to Arbadella. Barbara Jean Wong also appeared several times on I Love a Mystery and later I Love an Adventure. On I Love a Mystery she played a variety of characters, most often such Chinese characters as P.Y. Ling and Lee Taw Ming. Barabra Jean Wong also played the daughter on The Smiths of San Fernando, the 1946 audition program (the radio equivalent of a television pilot) for what would become The Smiths of Hollywood.During the Golden Age of Hollywood, Barbara Jean Wong was very much in demand and appeared on several other radio shows. She made several appearances on the anthology show Lux Radio Theatre. She also appeared on such radio shows as Cavalcade of America, Hallmark Playhouse, Nightbeat, and Romance. Barbara Jean Wong would also have a movie career, although her roles of any significance would be playing Charlie Chan's daughter in Charlie Chan in Honolulu (1938), Nan Ti in China (1943), and Iris Ling in another Charlie Chan movie, The Red Dragon (1945). In most of her other film appearances her roles are usually incidental at best. Barbara Jean Wong appeared in a few roles on television, including such shows as Boston Blackie, The Lone Wolf, The Halls of Ivy, and Buffalo Bill Jr. After she married in 1950 her acted much less frequently. She provided the voice of Stormy in the animated film The Man From Button Willow (1965). In 1972 she guest starred on the TV show Anna and the King.In addition to acting, Barbara Jean Wong was a dancer and as a child performed at various events in the Los Angeles area, including Hollywood Women's Club costume party in 1935. Barbara Jean Wong earned degrees in drama and English at the University of Southern California and Columbia University. She taught elementary school in Los Angeles for 23 years before retiring in 1992. She was active in such community organizations as the Friends of the Chinese American  Museum and El Pueblo Historical Monument.In an era when Asian Americans rarely appeared in movies and were perhaps even more rare on radio, Barbara Jean Wong carved out a career as a radio performer. She was a highly versatile actor, appearing in everything from adventures shows to comedies."},

{"title": "The Resurgence of Western Comic Books in the Late 1960s and Early 1970s Part Three", "date": "Saturday, May 21, 2022", "text": "The Western genre had been part of American comic books nearly since the beginning of the medium. In 1948 there was a surge in popularity of Western comic books, with several publishers introducing their own Western titles. By the late Fifties the genre had faded in popularity, with several publishers cancelling their remaining Western comic books. While Marvel Comics and Charlton continued to publish a few Western titles, from the early to mid-Sixties there was a lull in Western comic books. This changed in the late Sixties when there was a resurgence in the genre in comic books, with such new titles as Marvel's Ghost Rider DC Comic's Bat Lash making their debuts. This resurgence may have reached its peak in 1970, but the resurgence would continue for several more years with yet more new titles and characters being introduced. Among the new characters introduced during the resurgence would be one who would not only be the most famous Western comic book character to emerge from the resurgence, but possibly the most famous Western comic book character of all time.With the resurgence in Western comic books still going strong, a new comic book publisher would count Western titles among those they published. Skywald Publications entered the publishing field with the black and white comic magazine Nightmare in 1970. It was in 1971 that Skywald Publications made an attempt to enter the field of colour comic books under the imprint Skywald Comics. Of their first two titles one was a romance comic book (Tender Love Stories), while the other was a Western comic book titled Blazing Six Guns. Both were cover dated February 1971. Blazing Six Guns was an anthology title that included an original story featuring The Sundance Kid as well as reprints of Western stories from defunct publishers such as Magazine Enterprises and Avon. Blazing Six Guns only lasted two issues. It was followed by Wild Western Action, cover dated March 1971. Each issue of Wild Western Action included an original story featuring a team of Western heroes known collectively as The Bravados. as well as reprints from defunct publishers such as Toby, Magazine Enterprises, and Avon. Wild Western Action only lasted three issues.Skywald Comics' first title devoted to a single character followed Wild Western Action. The first issue of Butch Cassidy was cover dated June 1971. Each issue featured an original story starring Butch Cassidy, and like Skywald's other titles each issue featured reprints from other publishers. Butch Cassidy proved about as successful as Wild Western Action. lasting only three issues. That same month saw The Sundance Kid get his own title. It followed the same format as Skywald's other Western titles, with an original story followed by several reprints. It also lasted only three issues. Skywald's last Western title was The Bravados, with the team of Western heroes getting its own title. It only lasted for one issue.Skywald Comics did not prove particularly successful, a fact which editor Al Hewetson attributed to \"a price war\" between DC and Marvel \"which hurt just about everybody.\" Skywald Comics published its last colour comic book with a cover date of October 1971, that book being Butch Cassidy no. 3. Skywald Publications continued publishing their black and white magazines until finally going out of business in 1975. Their last magazine published was Psycho no. 24 (March 1975).While Skywald Comics' line of colour comic books failed, both Marvel and DC Comics continued publishing their own Western titles. It was in Avengers no. 80 (September 1970) that Marvel introduced a Native American superhero called Red Wolf. This Red Wolf lived in the Seventies, but Stan Lee decided he wanted the character to be set in the Old West. Red Wolf was then given a try-out starting out with Marvel Spotlight no. 1 (November 1971). Red Wolf was Johnny Wakely, a Cheyenne man who had been raised by white people. After stumbling upon the grave of a Cheyenne warrior known as Red Wolf, he was visited by a Native American spirit known as Owayodata and he became Red Wolf. Red Wolf was given his own title with Red Wolf no. 1 (May 1972). Unfortunately, Red Wolf would not prove to be successful. The title lasted for six issues before the setting was changed to modern times with someone else assuming the mantle of Red Wolf with issue no. 7 (May 1973). Red Wolf would only last two more issues. It would be decades before the Johnny Wakely version of Red Wolf would appear again. His first appearance in years would be in Rawhide Kid vol. 4 issue 2 (July 2010).It was in late 1971 that Marvel would introduce another title that consisted solely of reprints. The Western Kid had been a character that Marvel had published in the Fifties, both in his own title and in the anthology title Gunsmoke Western. The Western Kid was was Tex Dawson, a gunfighter who wandered the Old West doing good. Unlike other Marvel characters, such as Kid Colt and The Rawhide Kid, he had never been accused of a crime and was not wanted by the law. A reprint title, The Western Kid, debuted with a cover date of December 1971. It would not prove to be as successful as some of Marvel's other Western reprint titles, only lasting five issues. While Marvel would see little success with Red Wolf and its reprints of The Western Kid, DC Comics would see phenomenal success with their next Western character. In fact, it seems like that at this point Jonah Hex could well be the most famous Western character to debut in American comic books of all time. Jonah Hex is a bad tempered, cynical bounty hunter who, nonetheless, has a personal code of honour such that he will always protect the innocent. While many fictional Western comic book heroes could be matinee idols, one entire side of Jonah's face was scarred. Jonah Hex made his first appearance in All-Star Western no. 10 (March 1972). After several issues of featuring the adventures of such historical figures as Billy the Kid and Buffalo Bill, All-Star Western shifted back to its original format with its 10th issue. Jonah Hex was the headliner, with El Diablo and Bat Lash stories filling out the issue. Jonah Hex proved to be successful, remaining the headliner when All-Star Western was retitled Weird Western Tales and remaining the headliner until he received his own title, Jonah Hex Vol. 1 No. 1 (March/April 1977). The title Jonah Hex proved to be successful, ultimately running for 92 issues until August 1985, easily outlasting the resurgence in Western comic books. Since then Jonah Hex appeared in the title Hex (in which Jonah is thrown forward in time to an apocalyptic future) and still later in several titles set in Old West. He also appeared in an episode of Batman: The Animated Series, a 2010 live action feature film, and the TV series Legends of Tomorrow.It would only be two issues following Jonah Hex's first appearance that All-Star Western  was retitled Weird Western Tales. DC Comics had been publishing the anthology series Weird War Tales, which blended war stories with elements of horror, science fiction, and mystery. The title had proved successful, hence DC Comics retitled All-Star Western. And while it might seem unusual for DC Comics to have changed the format of All-Star Western to that of the Weird West, in some ways it  should not have been surprising. The origin of El Diablo, who had appeared in All-Star Western Volume 2, touched upon the supernatural. With Jonah Hex's introduction in issue no. 10, the Weird West elements in All-Star Western became even more pronounced. It must be pointed out that the late Sixties had also seen a resurgence of horror comic books, many of which proved to be highly successful. Regardless, with the new title and the not-quite-so-new format, Weird Western Tales proved to be a success. It ended its run with issue no. 70 (August 1980). It was only a few months after Jonah Hex's first appearance that Marvel published its last new Western title with entirely new material. Gunhawks no. 1 (October 1972) introduced gunfighters Reno Jones and Kid Cassidy. Kid Cassidy was the son of Southern planters, while Reno Jones had been one of the Cassidys' slaves. After the plantation was attacked by Union forces and Reno's lover Rachel was abducted, Reno Jones and Kid Cassidy enlisted in the Confederate Army. After the war they wandered the West, searching for Rachel. Kid Cassidy was killed off in Gunhawks no. 6 (August 1973). The series was then retitled Reno Jones, Gunhawk. This made Reno Jones the second African American character at Marvel to have his own title after Luke Cage. Reno Jones, Gunhawk no. 7 (October 1973) would also be the final issue of the title. Kid Cassidy and Reno Jones disappeared from the pages of comic books until the mini-series Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes in 2000, which told a more historically accurate (and politically correct) version of their story. Among  other things, Reno Jones never served in the Confederate Army.The same month that Gunhawks debuted, Marvel also re-introduced one of their titles from the Fifties as a reprint title. Wyatt Earp no. 30 (October 1972) resumed the numbering of the title, which had last been published in 1960. Despite having the name recognition of a historical figure, the reprint title Wyatt Earp did not prove particularly successful. It lasted for four issues, ending with no. 34 (June 1973).Marvel introduced yet another reprint title with Gun-slinger no. 1 (January 1973). Despite the title, this was another attempt on Marvel's part at reprinting old Western Kid stories. It proved no more successful than their attempt in 1971, lasting only three issues.The failure of Gunhawks, Wyatt Earp, and Gun-slinger signalled the end of the resurgence of Western comic books. Not counting Jonah Hex receiving his own title in 1977, no new Western titles would debut for the rest of the decade. Nevertheless, Marvel would continue publishing such titles as Kid Colt, Outlaw and The Rawhide Kid for the remainder of decade. DC Comics would continue publishing Weird Western Tales. What is more, DC would debut two new characters in the pages of Weird Western Tales. When Jonah Hex received his own title, his place in Weird Western Tales was taken by Scalphunter. Brian Savage was a young boy when he was abducted by Kiowa Indians, who raised him. When he left the tribe, he assumed the name \"Scalphunter.\" Scalphunter first appeared in Weird Western Tales no. 39 (March/April 1977). Scalphunter would continue to appear for the rest of the run of Weird Western Tales and has occasionally appeared in DC comic books since then.It was in Weird Western Tales no. 48 (September-October 1978) that DC Comics introduced another new Western character. Cinnamon was born Katherine \"Kate\" Masner. Her father was a sheriff in a Western town. When her father was killed, by bank robbers, Kate was sent to an orphanage. While there she secretly taught herself to be a gunfighter. Once she came of age, she became a bounty hunter. Cinnamon would only appear in two issues of Weird Western Tales, but would prove to have some success in the long run. She has appeared sporadically in comic books ever since. In more recent comic books she has been teamed with the old DC Comics character Nighthawk. She has also appeared in an episode of the TV show Legends of Tomorrow. Marvel Comics would attempt to introduce a new Western character in 1980. Caleb Hammer was a Pinkerton detective in the Old West who appeared in Marvel Premiere no. 54 (June 1980).  That would remain his only appearance until he resurfaced in the 2000 mini-series Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes. Even though DC Comics would introduce two new Western characters in the late Seventies, the resurgence in Western comic books more or less ended in 1973. The resurgence's end marked the start of a slow decline for the Western genre in comic books. Marvel cancelled Western Gunfighters in 1975 and The Mighty Marvel Western in 1976. They cancelled The Two-Gun Kid in 1977. It was in 1979 that Marvel cancelled its two remaining Western titles: Kid Colt, Outlaw ended its run after thirty one years, making him the longest continuously published Western comic book character of all time. That same year The Rawhide Kid ended its run as well. It was the following year that DC Comics cancelled Weird Western Tales. Only Jonah Hex would last into the Eighties, ending its run in 1985.As to what brought the resurgence of Western comic books to an end, that can be attributed to the decline of the popularity of the Western genre as a whole in American society. While the Western was a popular film genre in the Thirties, Forties, Fifties, and even the Sixties, in the Seventies the Western was not nearly as popular as it once was. In the Seventies only Blazing Saddles (1974), which was notably a parody of the genre, ranked in the top ten highest grossing movies for its year. In the late Fifties  there was often at least one Western television show on every night. The Seventies saw the cancellation of the long running Westerns Bonanza and Gunsmoke. Even readership for Western fiction began declining in the mid-Seventies. With the Western genre declining in popularity in other media, in some respects it is remarkable that it persisted in comic books as long as it did.While the resurgence in Western comic books only lasted from about 1967 to 1976, it would have a lasting impact. At Marvel, The Ghost Rider, rechristened The Phantom Rider, would continue to appear in Marvel comic books, even playing a role in titles devoted to the motorcyclist known as The Ghost Rider.  At DC Comics, Jonah Hex would prove so successful that his fame may well exceed characters who originated in the Forties, Fifties, and Sixties, such as Kid Colt, Pow-Wow Smith, and The Rawhide Kid. Other characters, such as El Diablo, Scalphunter, and Cinnamon still appear from time to time. Strangely enough, while  historically Marvel had more success with Westerns than DC prior to the resurgence (after all, they continued to publish Western comic books from 1948 to 1980), DC Comics had more success than Marvel did during the resurgence. Weird Western Tales would be longest running Western title to emerge during the resurgence, while Jonah Hex, a title devoted to a character from the resurgence, would be the longest running Western title to debut in the Seventies. Both Marvel and DC Comics have returned to the Western genre from time to time since the end of the resurgence in Western comic books in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 2000 Marvel published the mini-series Blaze of Glory, followed by its sequel Apache Skies in 2002. A controversial third volume of The Rawhide Kid was published in 2003 followed by a sequel mini-series, Rawhide Kid: The Sensational Seven, in 2010. DC Comics has perhaps made more use of their Western characters, with three mini-series featuring Jonah Hex alone, as well as two new titles starring the character. As part of the New 52, DC Comics even published a third volume of All-Star Western that continued the adventures of Jonah Hex and also featured such characters as Nighthawk, Cinnamon, Tomahawk, and Bat Lash. It lasted for 34 issues. While the heyday of the Western comic book may be long past, it is safe to say that some of the characters from the resurgence in Western comic books that lasted from 1967 to 1973 will be around for a long time."},
{"title": "The Resurgence of Western Comic Books in the Late 1960s and Early 1970s Part Two", "date": "Friday, May 20, 2022", "text": "In 1948 the big trend in the American comic book industry was the Western genre. Western comic books would remain popular until the late Fifties when the genre went into decline. While Marvel Comics and Charlton Comics would continue publishing Western titles, the genre was in a lull for much of the Sixties. In 1967 Marvel Comics published the first issue of Ghost Rider with a cover date of February. While Ghost Rider would only last seven issues, it was significant as the first title in what would be a resurgence of Western comic books that would last into the early Seventies. Indeed, if one could not take Ghost Rider as a sign that Western comic books were due for a comeback, the fact that DC Comics re-entered the field could be. In 1961 DC Comics cancelled its two Western titles, Western Comics and All-Star Western. It was in the pages of Showcase no. 76 (August 1968) that DC Comics introduced its first new Western character in years. Bat Lash was a gambler and bit of a ladies man who detested violence. Denny O'Neil, who wrote dialogue for the character, described him as  \"a charming rogue.\" Bat Lash's try out in Showcase proved successful enough that he received his own title, the first issue cover dated October/November 1968. This made it the first Western comic book published by DC Comics in years. Unfortunately, Bat Lash would last only seven issues, ceasing publication with its October/November 1969 issue. DC Comics editorial director Carmine Infantino claimed that while Bat Lash sold well in Europe, it did not sell well in the United States. Denny O'Neil tended to doubt this, stating that low sales were always given as the reason for cancelling titles at that time, and he didn't think Bat Lash suffered from low sales. Regardless, Bat Lash won the Alley Award for Best Western Title in both 1968 and 1969. And while Bat Lash's original title was cancelled after only seven issues, the character has persisted ever since, appearing in issues of Weird Western Tales, Jonah Hex, and yet other titles. In 2008 he even received his own self-titled mini-series written by creator Sergio Aragonés.While DC Comics published its first issue of Bat Lash, Marvel Comics published the first issue of The Mighty Marvel Western, cover dated October 1968. While The Mighty Marvel Western was a new title, it exclusively published reprints stories of Marvel's Western heroes. Every issue featured a Rawhide Kid story and a Two-Gun Kid story, and most issues featured a Kid Colt story. In those issues where there wasn't a Kid Colt story, a reprint of a Matt Slade, Gunfighter story appeared. While The Mighty Marvel Western contained exclusively reprints, it did prove somewhat successful. It lasted for 46 issues until 1976.With Showcase no. 85 (September 1969) DC Comics tried out another Western character. Firehair was the lone survivor of a wagon train massacred by the Blackfoot Indians in the early 19th Century. An infant at the time of the massacre, he was adopted by the Blackfoot Chief Grey Cloud. The try-out for Firehair would not prove successful enough to warrant his own title, but he would later appear as a recurring character in Tomahawk after that title had shifted its lead character to Tomahawk's son and the time frame to the early 19th Century (more on that later).The resurgence of Western comic books may well have reached its peak in 1970, with new titles launched and one older title rebooted as a Western. The first new title to appear in 1970 was actually the revival of an old Marvel  title. The Ringo Kid had run from August 1954 to September 1957. It was with a cover date of January 1970 that a new volume of The Ringo Kid debuted. This new volume of The Ringo Kid consisted entirely of reprints and proved somewhat successful, running for thirty issues until November 1976. The second Western title to debut in 1970 was Western Gunfighters, with a cover date of August 1970. Western Gunfighters shared its name with an earlier Western anthology published by Marvel from June 1956 to June 1957. Unlike The Mighty Marvel Western, this new version of Western Gunfighters did contain original material, at least for its first seven issues. News stories featuring Ghost Rider appeared in those first seven issues, as well as three new features. Gunhawk was a bounty hunter and gunfighter with no name who wandered throughout the Old West. \"Tales of Fort Rango\" centred on the adventures of the troopers of Fort Rango. \"Renegades\" centred on a team of adventurers led by a gunfighter known only as The Dude and also consisting of knife thrower Carlos Cortez, young gunfighter The Kid, and outdoorsman and trapper Little Flower. The first seven issues also featured reprints of stories featuring The Apache Kid, The Western Kid, Wyatt Earp, and Black Rider. It was with issue 8 that the new features were dropped from Western Gunfighters and it shifted to being entirely a reprint title. While Ghost Rider would appear from time to time in Marvel titles (renamed \"Phantom Rider\" to avoid confusion with the newer, motorcycle riding Ghost Rider), Gunhawk, the troopers of Fort Rango, and the Renegades would not appear again for literally years. It was also with a cover date of August 1970 that another revival of an old Marvel title, The Outlaw Kid, was first published. Like The Ringo Kid, The Outlaw Kid was originally a reprint title. The title sold well enough that with issue 10 it started featuring brand new stories. Strangely enough, with the new stories sales for The Outlaw Kid dropped, so that after issue 16 it switched back to being a reprint title. Regardless, it proved highly successful, lasting for thirty issues until October 1975.While Marvel Comics published most of the new Western titles in 1970, it would arguably be DC Comics that would publish what might well have been the most significant title of the year. All-Star Western was a revival of a title that had run from 1951 to 1961. That first issue, cover dated September 1970, included a new story featuring DC Comics' old Western character Pow-Wow Smith, as well as a reprint of a  Pow-Wow Smith story from Western Comics. It was with the second issue, cover dated October 1970) the all new features \"El Diablo\" and \"Outlaw\" were introduced. El Diablo was Lazarus Lane, a bank teller who was almost killed by outlaws and then struck by lightning. He was resurrected by his friend, the Native American medicine man Wise Owl. Afterwards he fought evil throughout the Old West as the masked avenger El Diablo. \"Outlaw\" centred on Rick Wilson, the young son of a Texas Ranger who wanted to become a Ranger himself. It was after his father objected to him becoming a Ranger that Rick Wilson fell in with the wrong crowd and found himself on the wrong side of the law. \"Outlaw\" featuring Rick Wilson would last appear in All-Star Western Volume 2 issue 5 (May 1971). With All-Star Western Volume 2 issue 6 (July 1971), the title's emphasis would be on such real life Western and frontier figures as Billy the Kid, Wild Bill Hickok, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill Cody, with the occasional El Diablo or Pow-Wow Smith story. While both Marvel and DC debuted new titles in 1970 (although some of them were reprint titles), DC Comics also rebooted a title it had been publishing for twenty years. The character of Tomahawk had first appeared in Star Spangled Comics no. 69 (June 1947). The character proved popular enough to receive his own title, the first issue of which was cover-dated September 1950) Tomahawk was a frontiersman and soldier who served under George Washington during the Revolutionary War, leading unit known as \"Tomahawk's Rangers\" While Tomahawk was a popular title for much of its run, its sale started to decline in the Sixties. With Western comic books enjoying new titles, Tomahawk was rebooted as a Western with Tomahawk no. 131 (December 1970). While its title was still technically Tomahawk, its covers now bore the legend Son of Tomahawk. The son of Tomahawk as Hawk, the son of Tomahawk by a Native American woman named Moon Fawn. He was born around 1900 and would have adventures in the American West in the early 19th Century. Despite being the son of a legendary adventurer and American Revolution veteran, Hawk despised violence, even though he was a skilled combatant himself. Sadly, the change in the format of Tomahawk would not save the title.  With the \"Son of Tomahawk\" as its star, Tomahawk only lasted ten more issues, ending with no. 140 (June 1972).While 1970 was arguably the peak of the resurgence in Western comic books, it would continue for several more years. The year 1971 would see new titles from Marvel Comics and a new publisher entering the field, albeit unsuccessfully. It would be the year 1972 that would see the debut of the most famous character to emerge from the resurgence of Western comic books, possibly the most famous Western comic book character of all time."},
{"title": "The Resurgence of Western Comic Books in the Late 1960s and Early 1970s Part One", "date": "Thursday, May 19, 2022", "text": "After over a decade of popularity, Western comic books went into decline in the late Fifties and early Sixties. While Charlton Comics and Marvel Comics would continue publishing Western titles throughout the Sixties, after 1961 there would be a lull in the debut of any titles for a few years. As for National Periodical Publications (now known as DC Comics), they entirely stopped publishing their Western titles with the cancellations of Western Comics and All Star Western in 1961. It was in the mid to late Sixties and into the early Seventies that new Western titles began to appear. These Western comic books differed from earlier Western comic books in that they were often grittier, often cynical, and often more historically accurate. Women played a more prominent role and Native Americans were treated more sympathetically. The Western genre had a long history in comic books nearly from the beginning of the medium. New Fun Comics no. 1 (January 1935), the first comic book ever published by the company that would become DC Comics, featured several Western stories (including one centred on cowboy star Tom Mix). Centaur Publications published the first comic books devoted entirely to the Western genre, Star Ranger (February 1937) and Western Picture Stories (February 1937). Dell Comics closely followed with their own Western comic book, Western Action Thrillers (April 1937). It was in 1941 that Dell began publishing Red Ryder Comics, which included reprints of the popular newspaper strip before starting to include original material with its 47th issue (June 1947). While Western stories appeared in comic books nearly from the beginning, it would be after World War II that the genre truly became popular. With superheroes declining in popularity following the war, comic book publishers turned to other genres, among them the Western. In 1946 Dell Comics launched a Gene Autry title that would run for years. That same year Fawcett Comics began a successful run of Hopalong Cassidy that DC Comics took over once Fawcett shuttered its line of comic books and ultimately lasted until 1959. It was in the year 1948 that Western comic books proved to be a big trend in the comic book industry. DC Comics launched the simply titled Western Comics, the first issue cover dated January/February 1948. At the same time Dell Comics published the first issue of The Lone Ranger, which would ultimately run into the Seventies. Other publishers would soon follow suit with their own Western titles, among them what would become Marvel Comics. Their first Western comic book was Two-Gun Kid no. 1 (March 1948).The heyday of the Western comic book would only last about ten years. Starting in the mid-Fifties many of the cowboy star comic books ended their runs. Given B-Western movies had been in decline for some time (Universal had ceased making them in 1946, while United Artists released their last one in 1950), this probably was not a surprise at the time. In the late Fifties other types of Western comic books would also be cancelled. Prize Western, Red Ryder, and Straight Arrow all ended in 1956. Dell Comics cancelled The Cisco Kid in 1958. DC Comics cancelled Western Comics with issue no. 85 (January/February 1961) and All-Star Western with issue no. 62 (July 1961), effectively getting out of the business of publishing Western comic books.That many Western titles were cancelled in the late Fifties and early Sixties did not mean that there were no more Western comic books. Marvel continued to publish Western comic books and even debuted two new characters in the early Sixties. They introduced a new version of The Rawhide Kid with Rawhide Kid no. no. 17 (August 1960) and a new version of The Two-Gun Kid with Two-Gun Kid no. 60 (November 1961). Ultimately, Marvel would publish Western comic books until the cancellations of Kid Colt, Outlaw and Rawhide Kid in 1979. Charlton Comics also continued to publish Western titles as well, with Outlaws of the West lasting until 1980 and Billy the Kid until 1983. While Marvel and Charlton continued to publish Westerns in the Sixties, after 1961 it would be a few years before new titles would emerge. These initial new Western titles could be considered harbingers of the resurgence in the Western comic book. It was Charlton that would publish the first of these new Western titles, although it featured a character who had existed for a few years. The Gunmaster first appeared in Six-Gun Heroes no. 57 (June 1960). It was in 1964 that the character received his own title, Gunmaster (September 1964). The title would only last four issues, ending with issue no. 4 (March-April 1965). Afterwards, The Gunmaster would go back to appear in Charlton's various other Western titles. As to The Gunmaster, he was Clay Boone, a travelling gunsmith who would don a mask to fight crime as The Gunmaster.A more important title that would presage the resurgence in Western comic books in the late Sixties was published by Dell Comics, although it only lasted briefly. Lobo was historic as the first comic book in which an African American character headlined. Lobo centred on a wealthy, Black gunslinger who would be given the name \"Lobo\" by the villains in the first issue of the title. Lobo would leave a gold coin with the images of an \"L\" and a wolf on the foreheads of the villains he defeated. Lobo was created by writer Don \"D. J.\" Arneson and artist Tony Tallarico, although the two men disagree on the character's creation.. Mr. Arneson has said that Mr. Tallarico only illustrated the comic book. He denies that Mr. Tallarico created the character, and has said that he plotted the stories and wrote the scripts. According to D. J. Arneson, he had read the book  The Negro Cowboys by Philip Durham and Everett L. Jones and used that as inspiration for the character.  Tony Tallarico claims that he approached D. J. Arneson with the idea.Sadly, Lobo only lasted two issues, dated December 1965 and September 1966. It should come as no surprise that Tony Tallarico and D. J. Arneson also disagreed on why Lobo ended. According to Tony Tallarico, distributors were returning bundles of the comic books unopened. He claims that after some investigating he discovered that many sellers opposed the idea of a Black Western hero. D. J. Arneson's explanation for the cancellation of Lobo is much simpler. It was simply discontinued because of sales. Regardless, Lobo was historic. He was the first Black character to have his own title and the first Black Western comic book hero. Lobo also indicated the direction the resurgence of Western titles would take. In the Western titles of late Sixties, African Americans would play a bigger role, having largely been absent from the Western comic books of the Fifties and Sixties.It was in 1966 that Charlton introduced another new Western title, although technically it was the continuation of another title. Gunfighters had begun its life as Kid Montana. It was with issue no. 51 that it was retitled Gunfighters. Gunfighters was an anthology title and relied upon Western characters already published by Charlton. It introduced no new characters. Regardless, it proved to be a success for Charlton. It ran until July 1984.If it there is a point where one can say the resurgence in Western comic books began, it might well be with Marvel Comics' Ghost Rider no. 1 (February 1967). Marvel's Ghost Rider was not the first comic book character to bear the name. Starting in 1950 Magazine Enterprises published a character named Ghost Rider.  Ghost Rider was  Rex Fury, a masked crimefighter who often found himself facing supernatural menaces. Magazine Enterprises went out of business in 1958 and eventually their trademark on the name \"Ghost Rider\" lapsed. Marvel then published their own title featuring a different character by that name. Marvel's Ghost Rider was Carter Slade, who donned a mask and a phosphorescent costume to fight crime.  Unlike Magazine Enterprise's \"Ghost Rider,\" Marvel Comics' Ghost Rider was a straight forward Western and Carter Slade never faced supernatural opponents. Ghost Rider only lasted for seven issues, and the character would later appear in issues of Marvel's anthology title Western Gunfighters. While Ghost Rider might not have been successful, it can be considered the first title in the resurgence of Western comic books in the late Sixties. It would be a little less than a year after Ghost Rider ended publication that a new Western character would be introduced. This time it would be DC Comics introducing a new Western character, their first foray into Westerns since 1961."},
{"title": "The Kim Sisters Singing \"Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho\" on The Ed Sullivan Show", "date": "Wednesday, May 18, 2022", "text": "Decades before most Americans heard the word \"K-Pop,\" The Kim Sisters were a Korean vocal group that saw a good deal of success in the United States in the late Fifties into the Sixties. They mostly preformed American songs, both traditional and more contemporary pop. If you want to read more on the Kim Sisters, you can do so here.The Kim Sisters appeared on many of the American variety and talk shows of the era, including The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, The Hollywood Palace, The Dean Martin Show, The Joey Bishop Show, Della, The Barbara McNair Show, and The Merv Griffin Show. They made by far their most appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show, on which they appeared nineteen times from 1958 to 1967. This is one of their appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Online sources claim it is from August 22 1965, but I have my doubts as the last new episodes of The Ed Sullivan Show usually aired in June and new episodes wouldn't air until September. Regardless, the Kim Sisters are performing the African American spiritual \"Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho.\" Its origin is somewhat obscure. There are claims that it originated among slaves in the early 19th Century. Other sources claim a copyright by Jay Roberts in 1865. The song first appeared in print in 1882 in A Collection of Revival Hymns and Plantation Melodies. The song has been recorded by artists from Paul Robeson to Bing Crosby to Elvis Presley."},

Maggie Peterson was born on January 10 1941 in Greeley, Colorado. She, her brother, and two of his friends formed an instrumental and vocal group called The Ja-Da Quartet. The Ja-Da Quartet met with enough success, and were eventually discovered by Andy Griffith's manager. It was through Andy Griffith's manager that they went to New York and later appeared on one episode of The Garry Moore Show and two episodes of The Perry Como Show. They recorded one album, It's the Most Happy Sound.Maggie Peterson tried out for the part of Sheriff Andy Taylor's love interest during the first season of The Andy Griffith Show, but lost the part to Elinor Donahue. She was cast as Charlene Darling near the end of the third season of The Andy Griffith Show. Charlene was the daughter of hillbilly Briscoe Darling (Denver Pyle) and part of the Darling family. The Darlings first appeared in the episode \"The Darlings Are Coming\" and proved popular enough to appear in four more episodes. Maggie Peterson later played a date for Sam Jones (Ken Berry) in the 1968 episode \"A Girl for Goober.\" In 1964 Maggie Peterson was cast in the recurring role of Suzie the Waitress on The Bill Dana Show. In the Sixties she also guest starred on the shows Gomer Pyle: USMC; The Queen and I; Love, American Style; Green Acres; and Mayberry R.F.D. She also appeared in the TV movie The Over-the-Hill Gang. Maggie Peterson only appeared in two movies in her career, both of which starred veterans of The Andy Griffith Show. The first was Angel in My Pocket (1969), which starred Andy Griffith. The second was The Love God? (1969), which starred Don Knotts.In the Seventies she guest starred on The Odd Couple and Odd Man Out. She appeared in the TV movie Pleasure Palace. In the Eighties she appeared in the TV movie Stark and guest starred on The Disney Sunday Movie. She reprised her role as Charline Darling in the Andy Griffith Show reunion movie Return to Mayberry. Maggie Peterson would later work  for the Nevada Film Commission. She worked in location management for the movies Casino (1995), Mars Attacks! (1996), Perdita Durango (1997), Go (1999), and Pay It Forward (2000). She also worked in location manager for the 1998 TV movie Money Play$. Maggie Peterson was perfectly cast as Charlene Darling, the overly superstitious, overly flirtatious hillbilly who had a crush on Andy Taylor and was pursued by Ernest T. Bass (Howard Morris). While Maggie Peterson will probably always be known best for Charlene Darling on The Andy Griffith Show, she could and did play other roles. On The Andy Griffith Show she also played the secretary Doris, who was a far from Charlene as one could get. In the Mayberry R.F.D. episode she played Edna, a new waitress at one of Mayberry's coffee shops. Edna is also a far cry from Charlene, preferring flowery descriptions when talking about the food served by the shop. Maggie Peterson was a fine actress who will always be remembered as Charlene on The Andy Griffith Show, but who did much more."},

{"title": "Bruce Lee's Television Career", "date": "Friday, May 13, 2022", "text": "Today Bruce Lee is best known as a movie star, who had appeared in such films as The Big Boss (1971), Fist of Fury (1972), and Enter the Dragon (1973). While Bruce Lee had begun his career as a child star in Hong Kong films, he began his career in the United States in television. Indeed, Kato on the 1966 TV series The Green Hornet remains one of his best known roles.Bruce Lee was born in San Francisco on November 27 1940 while his father, famous Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-chen, was there for an international opera tour. Bruce Lee was only four months old when his family returned to Hong Kong. Born to a family who worked in entertainment, Bruce Lee made his film debut when he was only a baby. He appeared in Golden Gate Girl (1941). From the late Forties to the late Fifties, Bruce Lee was a highly successful child star in Hong Kong. He had appeared in twenty films by the time he was 18.Bruce Lee was first exposed to the martial arts St. Francis Xavier's College in Hong Kong, where Brother Edward, coach of the boxing team, acted as a mentor to him. It was after young Bruce was involved in various street brawls that his family decided that he required training in the martial arts. By 1958 he was skilled enough in the martial arts to win the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament. It was in 1959 that his family decided to send Bruce Lee to the United States. It was in Seattle that he would open his first martial arts school. He also began competing in various martial arts tournaments.It was at a martial arts exhibition in Long Beach in 1964 that he was discovered by television producer William Dozier. Mr. Dozier was developing a show to be called Number One Son. Described as \"a Chinese James Bond,\" the show would follow the adventures of Charlie Chan's eldest son, Lee Chan, hence the title. Bruce Lee even made a screen test for the show, which is available on YouTube. Unfortunately, ABC ultimately passed on the show.William Dozier would go onto produce the smash hit TV show Batman. When it came time for him to cast his next television series, The Green Hornet, he had Bruce Lee in mind. The Green Hornet was based on the radio show of the same name that ran from 1936 to 1952. It centred on the vigilante of that name, whose alter ego was the publisher of the Daily Sentinel newspaper, Britt Reid. The Green Hornet was assisted in his fight against crime by his valet Kato. The television series The Green Hornet differed from the radio show in some respects, but it still retained the idea of crusading newspaper publisher Britt Reid fighting crime as The Green Hornet and Kato assisting him in his fight against crime. Van Williams, who had appeared on the TV shows Bourbon Street Beat and Surfside 6, played Britt Reid/The Green Hornet. Bruce Lee played Kato. Bruce Lee would have an impact on both on the character of Kato and the television show. First, Bruce Lee insisted that Kato would not be a stereotype. He would not speak in broken English and he would not run around in a pigtail. Second, while it was originally planned for The Green Hornet to feature fisticuffs of the sort featured in any other American television show (including Batman), Bruce Lee insisted on the using the Chinese martial arts with which he was most familiar. As it turned out, Bruce Lee moved so swiftly in the show's fight sequences that the camera did not capture his movements. He then actually had to slow down for the show. Regardless, Kato became the first character on an American show to regularly use Asian martial arts. Bruce Lee's appearance in the series ultimately led to increased interest in Asian martial arts across the Unites States. Van Williams and Bruce Lee as The Green Hornet and Kato would appear on producer William Dozier's other show, Batman, three times. The first time was a Batclimb cameo in \"The Spell of Tut.\" For those unfamiliar with the TV series Batman, a Batclimb cameo occurred when Batman and Robin were climbing a building and some celebrity or popular character opened a window. The second and third times The Green Hornet and Kato appeared on Batman were in the episodes \"A Piece of the Action\" and \"Batman's Satisfaction.\" It was the episode \"Batman's Satisfaction\" that featured a fight between Kato and Robin. The script actually called for Robin to win, perhaps because Batman was the more popular of the two shows and, after all, this was an episode of Batman. Bruce Lee absolutely refused to have Kato win the fight, and even walked off the set to make his point. The scene was ultimately rewritten so that the fight ended in a draw, particularly given no one believed Kato would lose in a fight with Robin.Sadly, The Green Hornet was scheduled on Friday night against the popular Western/James Bond spoof The Wild Wild West on CBS and Tarzan on NBC. Its ratings were then disappointing. Even The Green Hornet and Kato's appearances on Batman did not help the show in the Nielsens. It was ultimately cancelled at the end of the 1966-1967 season.This was hardly the end of Bruce Lee's career in American television. He guest starred on Ironside in the episode \"Tagged for Murder\" on October 26 1967 on NBC. In the episode Bruce Lee played a karate instructor, Leon Soo, in San Francisco's Chinatown. It was well over a year later that Bruce Lee guest starred on the Blondie episode \"Pick on Someone Your Own Size\" on January 9 1969 on CBS. Both Dagwood (Will Hutchins) and Alexander (Peter Robbins) are the victim of bullies, so Dagwood decides to enroll in martial arts classes. Bruce Lee played a karate instructor in the episode.The Here Come the Brides episode \"Marriage, Chinese Style\" is unusual among Bruce Lee's television appearances in that it did not centre on his skill in martial arts. This episode centred on a Chinese woman named Toy Quin (Linda Dangcil) who has arrived in town for an arranged marriage. Her fiancé was played by Bruce Lee, Lin Sung. As it turns out, Lin Sung does not want to marry a woman he has never met. While martial arts was not the central focus of Bruce Lee's character in the episode, he does get to engage in some martial arts fight scenes. The episode aired on April 19 1969 on ABC.Bruce Lee's final appearance in scripted American television would be a recurring role on the show Longsteet. Longstreet starred James Franciscus as insurance instructor Mike Longsteet, who had been blinded when a bomb exploded. Bruce Lee played Li Tsung, an antiques dealer and expert in martial arts who trains Longstreet in martial arts. Longstreet featured Jeet Kune Do, the martial arts philosophy developed by Bruce Lee, well before Enter the Dragon. Unfortunately, Longstreet was not a hit in the ratings and was cancelled at the end of the 1971-1972 season.In 1971 Bruce Lee appeared in the Hong Kong martial arts movie The Big Boss, which propelled him to stardom across Asia. His 1972 movie, Fist of Fury, made Bruce Lee a star in the United States. Longstreet would then be his last appearance on American television. It was on July 20 1973 that Bruce Lee died at the age of 32. While Bruce Lee would become best known for his movies, his appearances on television arguably paved the way for his film superstardom. Indeed, it was in part the success of The Green Hornet in Hong Kong that would lead to his contract to appear in two films produced by Golden Harvest. It seems possible, then, that without Kato, there would never have been The Big Boss."},
{"title": "\"Heat Wave\" by Martha and the Vandellas", "date": "Thursday, May 12, 2022", "text": "This is our fourth straight day of temperatures reaching above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. We have broken temperature records most of this week. To give you an idea of how hot this is for early to mid May in Missouri, our average high temperature this year is about 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Of course, long time readers of this blog know I have been miserable. I hate heat when combined with humidity, and for that reason I hate summer. I can somewhat handle 90+ degree temperatures in July, even though I don't like them, because I have had time to adapt to them. This May we went straight from below normal temperatures (the 50s and 60s) to temperatures that are far above normal.Because of the heat, I am not in the mood to write a long blog post. I will then leave you with a song, namely \"Heat Wave\" by Martha and the Vandellas. The song was released on July 9 1963 and ultimately peaked at no. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The songs takes a somewhat more positive view of heat waves than I have right now, describing a person's love for a fellow in terms of rising temperatures."},
{"title": "The Late Great George Pérez", "date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2022", "text": "George Pérez, a comic book artist known for his work on The Avengers at Marvel in the Seventies, and The New Teen Titans, Crisis on Infinite Earths, and Wonder Woman at DC in the Eighties, died on May 6 2022 at the age of 67. The cause was complications from pancreatic cancer, with which he had been diagnosed in December 2021.George Pérez was born on June 9 1954 in the South Bronx in New York City. His parents were Puerto Rican in descent. His father, Guzman Pérez, worked in meatpacking. His mother, Luz Maria Izquierdo, was a homemaker. George Pérez grew up reading superhero comic books and taught himself to draw. George Pérez began work in the comic book industry as an assistant to artist Rich Buckler in 1973. He made his professional debut in Astonishing Tales no. 25 (August 1975) with a two page satire of Rich Buckler's character Deathlok. In 1975 he went to work on the Marvel magazine Deadly Hands of Kung Fu, where he co-created The White Tiger with Bill Mantlo. The White Tiger was the first Puerto Rican superhero. That same year he began drawing The Avengers with issue no. 141 (November 1975). He would remain with The Avengers until 1980. From 1977 to 1981 he also worked on Marvel Two-In-One. George Pérez also worked on such Marvel titles as Bizarre Adventures, Captain America, Creatures on the Loose, The Defenders, Fantastic Four, Inhumans, Iron Man, Logan's Run, Man Called Nova, Marvel Team-Up, and X-Men. It was in 1980, while he was still working on The Avengers, that he began working with DC Comics. He drew the New Teen Titans preview story in DC Comics Presents no. 26  (October 1980) before going to work on the title The New Teen Titans. He would remain with the various Teen Titans titles until nearly the end of the decade. He was the penciller on DC Comics' historic crossover event, Crisis on Infinite Earths, which rebooted the DC Universe and included very nearly every DC character. Following Crisis on Infinite Earths George Pérez worked as both plotter and inker on the reboot of Wonder Woman. He returned to The New Teen Titans in 1988. In the Eighties, at DC, George Pérez also contributed to such titles as Action Comics, Adventures of Superman, All Star Squadron, Batman, Justice League of America, Secret Origins, Superman, the Swordquest miniseries, and World's Finest. In the Eighties he also did some work for Pacific Comics. In the 1990s George Pérez returned to Marvel to work on the mini-series Infinity Gauntlet. He also worked on the mini-series Sachs and Violens, The Silver Surfer, Ultraforce/Avengers, and the Thunderbolts Annual 1997. Late in the decade he returned to The Avengers. In the Nineties he also worked on Topps Comics' adaptation of the movie Jurassic Park and on Crimson Plague at Event Comics and later Image Comics. He also returned to the Teen Titans at DC Comics and worked on Deathstroke the Terminator. In the Naughts he worked on the DC/Marvel crossover mini-series JLA/Avengers. At DC Comics he worked on such titles as The Brave and the Bold, DC Universe, Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds, Infinite Crisis, Justice League of America, Justice Society of America, The Titans, and Wonder Woman. At Image Comics he worked on Witchblade no. 92 (December 2005). In the Teens he worked on the first issue of the mini-series Flashpoint: Secret Seven. He inked issues 1-4 of Green Arrow Vol. 5. He worked on Justice Society of America vol. 3 no. 50 (June 2011), Supergirl vol. 6 no. 8 (June 2012), Superman vol. 3 no. 1-6 (2011-2012), T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents no. 4 (April 2012), and World's Finest no. 1-7 (2012-2013)>George Pérez was perhaps the premier artist of his generation. He was known for his realistic, highly detailed style, and had a particular gift for drawing large groups of characters. He would certainly have a lasting influence. Along with writer Marv Wolfman, he revitalized the Teen Titans, introducing several new characters (Cyborg, Raven, and Starfire) and making changes to others (Dick Grayson, the original Robin, became Nightwing, Beast Boy from Doom Patrol became Changeling, and so on). He co-created the first Puerto Rican superhero, White Tiger. He worked on Crisis on Infinite Earths, which changed DC Comics forever. He also revitalized Wonder Woman, and his influence can be seen on the two recent movies. He would have a lasting impact on artists to come. George Pérez was also known for his kindness and his thoughtfulness of others. He was one of the founders of the Hero Initiative, a charity that helps comic book writes and artists in need. Perhaps more so than any other comic book creator George Pérez was known for his kindness to his fans. He was well known on the convention circuit for the time he devoted to his fans and his thoughtfulness towards them. When he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, after notifying his various relatives, he made sure to let his fans know.  If George Pérez was so loved in comic book fandom, it was not simply because he was a  great comic book artist. He was also a great man."},

{"title": "Perry Mason: \"The Case of the Final Fade-Out\"", "date": "Friday, May 6, 2022", "text": "This blog post is part of the Caftan Woman Blogathon Honoring Patricia Nolan-Hall, hosted by Jacqueline of Another Old Movie Blog and Patty of Lady Eve's Reel Life. For that reason I feel as if I should say something about Patricia Nolan-Hall, Paddy Lee to her many friends, before going onto the blog post proper. Paddy was author of the blog Caftan Woman. Paddy blogged for literally years. She launched Caftan Woman in 2008. She was also prolific. What is more, Paddy not only wrote her own blog, she also read many, many blogs and often left comments on them as well. Paddy had an enthusiasm for classic film and television that was unmatched by anyone. She had a sunny disposition and an uncanny knack for brightening anyone's day. She could also see the humour in most situations. Paddy had a very funny story about the time she was nearly run over by a garbage truck. I know it couldn't have been funny to her at the time, but Paddy told it in such a way that it was.With her positivity, her enthusiasm for classic film and television, and her devotion to her fellow bloggers, she was well loved in the classic film and television community,  I don't believe Paddy ever said so, but I have to think her favourite shows were Maverick and Perry Mason, as she wrote about those shows more than any other. For that reason, I chose to write about a Perry Mason episode for this blogathon. This one's for you, Paddy.---------Today it seems as if every single television show has a series finale, but there was a time when they were relatively uncommon. Even when it was known ahead of time that a show was ending production, as when the producers of a show simply decided to bring it to a close, that show usually would not have a proper series finale. For example, the final episode of I Love Lucy differed little from other episodes of the show. That final episode, \"The Ricardos Dedicate a Statue,\" centred on Ricky being chosen to dedicate statue that Lucy has inadvertently destroyed. That having been said, there were shows in the Fifties and Sixties that had proper series finales: The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Leave It To Beaver, and Route 66 being examples. Among those shows was Perry Mason.Perry Mason centred on the defence attorney of that name and was based on the series of successful novels by Erle Stanley Gardner. It starred Raymond Burr in the title role, with Barbara Hale as his secretary Della Street and William Hopper as detective Paul Drake. Perry Mason was brought to television by Gail Patrick Jackson. If the name \"Gail Patrick\" sounds familiar, it is because she was an actress known for such movies as Death Takes a Holiday (1934), My Man Godfrey (1936), Stage Door (1937), and My Favorite Wife (1940). She was also a friend of Erle Stanley Gardner and she had a law degree from the University of Alabama to boot. As the executive producer on Perry Mason, she was one of the first women to work as a producer in American television.Perry Mason debuted on CBS on September 21 1957 and it proved to be a huge hit. It always beat its competition, including a brand new Western on NBC titled Bonanza in its first two seasons. While Perry Mason was a ratings behemoth in its early years, its ratings would decline over time. Ranking no. 5 for the year in its fifth season, by its eighth season it had tumbled to a still respectable no. 38 for the year. In the meantime, Bonanza had moved from Saturday night to Sunday night, where its ratings grew until by 1964 it was the no. 1 show on the air. It was then for the 1965-1966 season that CBS decided to move Perry Mason to Sunday night in hopes of demolishing Bonanza. The show's lead, Raymond Burr, had wanted to leave the show since its fifth season, but CBS kept persuading him to remain with it. During the ninth season he once more expressed his desire to leave the show. CBS persuaded him to stay for one more season, which would be shot entirely in colour. It was only three weeks after CBS had persuaded him to stay with Perry Mason that he read in the trade papers that it had been cancelled.Fortunately, the producers of Perry Mason had enough time to fashion a series finale for the show. Even had \"The Case of the Final Fade-Out\" not been the series finale, it would have been far from a typical episode of Perry Mason. Indeed, in \"The Case of the Final Fade-Out,\" Perry finds himself dealing with two murder cases, one after the other. What is more, his client in the first case is the murder victim in the second case. In the first case the victim is Barry Conrad (James Stacy), the arrogant and self-centred star of a television series who will back stab anyone to further his career. When he winds up dead, television producer Jackson Sidemark (Denver Pyle) finds himself accused of murder. In the second case, it is Jackson Sidemark who winds up murdered. Perry's client is elderly actress Winifred Glover (Estelle Winwood). \"The Case of the Final Fade-Out\" also features one of the show's most interesting guest casts. In addition to James Stacy, Denver Pyle, and Estelle Winwood, other guest stars are Jackie Coogan, Gerald Mohr, and, in a rare dramatic role, Dick Clark. One has to think \"The Case of the Final Fade-Out\" was meant as a love letter to the show's fans, and as a result many of the show's crew appear in the episode. The murder of Barry Conrad having taken place on a television set, the witnesses on that set were naturally the crew working on that set. Many of the witnesses questioned regarding Barry Conrad's murder were  then actual members of the crew, including cameraman Dennis Dalzell, set decorator Carl Biddiscombe, costume supervisor Evelyn Carruth, and hairdresser Annabell Levy, among others. Gail Patrick Jackson even makes an appearance in the episode. At the bar in a restaurant, she is commenting, \"I wouldn't want to go up against Bonanza (as mentioned earlier, Perry Mason was scheduled against Bonanza in its final season).\" An actress who looks suspiciously like Barbara Hale also appears in the scene in the restaurant, playing a blonde starlet from the South. As if all of this was not enough, Erle Stanley Gardner, the creator of Perry Mason himself, appears as the judge in the second trial in the episode.\"The Case of the Final Fade-Out\" was set at a television studio. Serving as the studio lot was none other other than the Chaplin Studios on N. La Brea Avenue in Hollywood. This is where many of Charlie Chaplin's classic movies were filmed, including The Kid, which starred a young Jackie Coogan. For Jackie Coogan, then, \"The Case of the Final Fade-Out\" must have seemed like old home week. Many season finales, even those in the Sixties, offered, for lack of a better phrase, a note of finality to the particular series. In the series finale of Route 66, Tod Stiles gets married and gives up the open road. In the series finale of The Fugitive, Dr. Richard Kimble finally catches up with the One Armed Man and clears his name. This is not the case with \"The Case of the Final Fade-Out.\" At the end of the episode, it finds Perry, Della, and Paul about to embark on their next case. Indeed, Perry has the last words in the episode (and the series, for that matter), \"Now, it seems to me the place to start is at the beginning.\" At the same time, while \"The Case of the Final Fade-Out\" ends with life going on for Perry, Della, and Paul, one cannot mistake the episode as anything but a series finale, or at the very least a season finale. Made at a time when series finales were rare, \"The Case of the Final Fade-Out\" remains one of the best."},

{"title": "The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan", "date": "Wednesday, May 4, 2022", "text": "The first American television show to feature an Asian American lead was The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong starring Anna May Wong, which debuted on the Dumont Television Network in 1951. It would be twenty one years before another American television show would debut with an Asian lead, and even then it would be a Saturday morning cartoon. The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan debuted on CBS on September 9 1972. It starred Keye Luke as detective Charlie Chan. Not only was Keye Luke the first male Asian lead on an American television show, but he was also the first and only person of Chinese ancestry to play the role in an American production. In the Charlie Chan movies, Keye Luke had played Chan's Number One son, Lee.Well before the Seventies Charlie Chan was a source of controversy in the Chinese American community. The character has often been viewed as a stereotype, something that still holds true. It is perhaps for this reason that Charlie Chan as portrayed by Keye Luke on The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan differed a bit from the way the character was portrayed in the movies of the Thirties and Forties by Warner Oland and Sidney Toler. The broken English in which Chan spoke in the movies is gone in the animated cartoon. In The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan he speaks fluent, if somewhat formal, English. Similarly, the \"Confucius say\" type aphorisms Charlie Chan often quoted in the movies are also gone. An argument can be made that Charlie Chan is less of a stereotype in the cartoon than he is in the movies of the 1930s and 1940s.Aside from the changes to Charlie Chan himself, The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan also departs from the movies with regards to Charlie Chan's family. While in the movies Charlie Chan is portrayed as having a large family, only his first three sons are ever portrayed as helping out on cases. Those sons were Number One Son Lee (Keye Luke), Number Two Son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung), and Number Three Son Tommy (Benson Fong). In contrast, all ten of Charlie Chan's children are on hand in The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan. Furthermore, none of them are named \"Lee\" or \"Jimmy\" and the one named \"Tom\" would be the Number Four Son (Alan was Number Three).The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan was one of a number of Scooby-Doo Where Are You! imitators that Hanna-Barbera churned out in the early Seventies. The series centred on  an apparently widowed Charlie Chan and his children, who travelled the world in the Chan Van solving mysteries. The kids were the serious eldest son Henry; the mischievous second oldest son and disguise artist Stanley; oldest daughter Suzie; third oldest son Alan, a mechanical genius who invented the Chan Van; second oldest daughter Anne, who is a bit of a tomboy; Tom, the fifth oldest son, who is an intellectual; Flip, the sixth oldest son, who tends to say whatever comes into his head; Nancy, the third oldest daughter, who is a bit of a klutz; Mimi, the youngest daughter who tends to be a bit forward; and Scooter, the youngest of the children, who tends to be impulsive. The Chan Van was one of many vehicles in Hanna-Barbera cartoons of the era that could change into yet other vehicles. For example, it could switch from the van it usually was to, say, dump truck. The family also had a dog named Choo-Choo, While Keye Luke as Charlie Chan was top billed, the episodes usually centred on the children.Like many cartoons in the early Seventies, the oldest children on The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan had their own band and every episode would usually close with them performing some bubblegum pop song. The music for the show was produced by Don Kirshner, who had earlier produced the music for The Archie Show. Amazingly enough, no singles, let alone an album, of music from the album was ever released.When The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan debuted, its voice cast was entirely Asian in ancestry. Robert Ito, best known as Sam Fujiyama on Quincy, M.E., was the voice of Henry. Brian Tochi, who would go onto play Tomoko Nogata in the Police Academy, was the voice of Alan. The voices of the other kids were as follows: Stephen Wong as Stanley; Virginia Ann Lee as Suzie; Leslie Kumamota as Anne; Michael Takamoto as Tom; Jay Jay Jue as Flip; Debbie Jue as Nancy; Leslie Juwai as Mimi; and Robin Toma as Scooter. After the first few episodes it was decided that the accents of the Asian American actors were too hard to understand, so many of the roles were recast, some with actors who were not Asian Amerian. Robert Ito and Brian Tochi were the only voices of the children who remained. Three of the roles were recast with Asian American actors. Cherylene Lee (who had guest starred as a child on such shows as Bachelor Father and Ben Casey), voiced both Suzie and Mimi. Beverly Kushida (who would go onto guest star on such shows as Kung Fu and The Six Million Dollar Man) was cast as the voice of Nancy. The other roles were cast with white actors: Lennie Weinrib (who had played H. R. Pufnstuf) as Stanley; Jodie Foster (yes, that Jodie Foster) as Anne; John Gunn as Tom; and Gene Andrusco as Flip. As might be expected, The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan produced the usual merchandise associated with Saturday morning cartoons. There was a lunchbox from Thermos. Whitman produced an Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan jigsaw puzzle and a board game. Gold Key Comics published a comic book that lasted for four issues.The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan did not prove to be overly successful. It ran only one season on Saturday mornings on CBS. Reruns of the show aired the following season on CBS on Sunday morning. Although it is largely forgotten now, The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan was historic. It was only the second American television series to feature a lead of Asian descent. It was also the first American series in which the majority of characters were played by Asian Americans. What is more, the Chan kids each had their own distinct personalities and none of them could be considered stereotypes. The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan may have only been a Saturday morning cartoon, but it went well beyond many primetime shows of the time."},

In the Eighties she guest starred on the TV series Barney Miller; Hart to Hart; Remington Steele; Trapper John, M.D.; Benson; Murder, She Wrote; Dolly; and Cheers. In the Nineties she appeared in The Parent Trap (1998), playing the mother of the gold digger she had played in the 1961 version. She made a guest appearance on the TV show Then Came You in 2000. Joanna Barnes was also a successful novelist. She wrote the books The Deceivers, Pastora, Silverwood, and Who is Carla Hart?. She was a book reviewer for The Los Angeles Times and she wrote the syndicated column \"Touching Home,\" about interior design. Like many of my generation, Joanna Barnes will always be the child-hating gold digger Vicki Robinson in The Parent Trap (1961). She certainly excelled in the role. While she may always be remembered as Vicki in The Parent Trap (1961), she played other great roles as well. In Auntie Mame she played the snobbish debutante Gloria Upson, who is engaged to the title character's nephew Patrick (Roger Smith). In Spartacus she played the bloodthirsty Claudia Marius, one of the Romans for whom a gladiatorial fight is staged at the gladiator training school. Lest one think Miss Barnes never played nice roles, she was Jane in Tarzan, the Ape Man. She also played Lola on 21 Beacon Street, the ever resourceful secretary of private investigator Dennis Chase (Dennis Morgan). In The War Wagon she appears briefly as saloon hostess and old acquaintance of Lomax (Kirk Douglas), yet another character named Lola. Joanna Barnes was a versatile actress who did very well in \"bad girl\" roles, but could also play other sorts of roles just as well. She was certainly an enormous talent."},
{"title": "The Late Great Neal Adams", "date": "Saturday, April 30, 2022", "text": "The first comic book I can remember reading was Batman no. 234 (August 1971). The main story in that issue was \"Half an Evil.\" Although I didn't know it at the time, it was historic as the first appearance of the villain Two-Face since 1954.  Both the cover of Batman no. 234 and the story \"Half an Evil\" were pencilled by Neal Adams. Over the next several years I would read several comic books featuring art by Neal Adams, everything from Batman to Green Lantern. He would ultimately become one of my favourite comic book artists, if not my favourite. Sadly, Neal Adams died yesterday, April 28 2022, at the age of 80. According to his wife Marilyn Adams, the cause was complications from sepsis.Neal Adams was born on June 15 1941 in New York City. His father was in  the military, and so he spent much of his childhood on various U.S. Army bases. Neal Adams attended the School of Industrial Art in Manhattan and graduated in 1959. He submitted work to National Periodical Publications (the company then known informally and now known formally as DC Comics), but was continuously rejected). He found work at Archie Comics, drawing gag fillers for Archie's Joke Book Magazine. In the late Fifties he also worked as an assistant to cartoonist Howard Nostrand on the Bat Masterson newspaper strip for three months. Neal Adams began the Sixties providing commercial art for the advertising industry. After freelancing for a time, he found work at the Johnstone and Cushing agency, an agency that specialized in comic strip style advertisements. In 1962 Mr. Adams went to work on the Ben Casey newspaper strip, remaining with the strip's 3 1/2 year run. For a few weeks in 1966 Neal Adams was a ghost artist on the hard boiled detective comic strip Peter Scratch. The following year he found work at Warren Publishing, providing art for their magazines Creepy and Eerie. It was also in 1967 that Neal Adams finally found work at DC Comics. His first work was a penciller on the story \"It's My Turn to Die\" in the anthology title Our Army at War no. 182 (July 1967). That same year he also worked on DC's The Adventures of Bob Hope and The Adventures of Jerry Lewis. In 1967 he also did artwork for Star Spangled War Stories and a back-up story featuring the Elongated Man for Detective Comics no. 369 (November 1967). It was with Strange Adventures no. 206 (November 1967) that he began providing art for the \"Deadman\" feature. His cover for Strange Adventures no. 207 (December 1967) won the Alley Award for Best Cover. Neal Adams would continue drawing Deadman in Strange Adventures into 1969. In 1969, 1970, and 1971 he also did artwork for House of Mystery, Phantom Stranger, Teen Titans, Hot Wheels, Deadman back-up stories in Aquaman, Challengers of the Unknown, Witching Hour, and Justice League of America. It was with The Brave and the Bold no. 79 (November 1968) that Neal Adams first worked on the character with whom he is most associated, Batman. He continued to work on The Brave and the Bold until issue no. 86 (September 1969). That issue featured the first appearance of Green Arrow's new costume, as well as the first time he wore a goatee. Neal Adams's work on The Brave and the Bold was the first step towards the revamp of the character that he would undertake with writer Denny O'Neil. In the stories Mr. Adams drew for The Brave and the Bold, scenes were often set at night and Batman was drawn more realistically and less cartoony than he had been before. Neal Adams would again make history when he was teamed with Dennis O'Neil to write the \"Batman\" feature in Detective Comics no.395 (January 1970). Together Neal Adams and Dennis O'Neil took Batman away from the camp flavour that had developed with the TV show in 1966 and closer to the dark night avenger he had originally been. It was with Detective Comics no. 411 (May 1971) that they introduced Talia al Ghul. Her father, Ra's al Ghul, would be introduced in Batman no. 232 (June 1971). The two would soon number among Batman's most frequently featured foes. It was in \"Half an Evil\" in Batman no. 234 (August 1971) that they revived the Golden Age villain Two-Face after he had not appeared since 1954. With \"The Joker's Five-Way Revenge!\" in Batman #251 (Sept. 1973) they returned The Joker to the homicidal psychopath he had originally been.Batman would not be the only character that Neal Adams and Dennis O'Neil revamped. Beginning with Green Lantern vol. 2 no. 76 (April 1970), they also revamped Green Lantern. The two of them teamed Green Lantern up with Green Arrow, the latter who would serve as the voice of the counter culture. Messrs. Adams and O'Neil's run on Green Lantern was characterised by stories that dealt with current issues. For example, Green Lantern no. 85-86 featured a two part story in which Green Arrow's former sidekick Speedy has become addicted to heroin. During their run they deal with such issues as racism, overpopulation, and pollution. Unfortunately, sales for Green Lantern were not particularly good and the series was cancelled with no. 88 (March 1972). The remaining stories of Neal Adams and Denny O'Neil's run on Green Lantern were published as backup stories in The Flash no. 217-219.While Neal Adams was working at DC, he also did work for other companies. At Marvel, he provided artwork for X-Men no. 56-63 and no. 65 (February 1970). He also worked on Thor no. 180-181 (1970), Amazing Adventures no. 5-8 (1971), and The Avengers no. 93-96 (1971-1972). While working at DC he continued to occasionally work on Warren Publishing's Creepy and he worked on Vampirella no. 1 (September 1969). It was while he was working for DC Comics that he also founded Continuity Associates with  Dick Giordano in 1971. Continuity Associates is an art and illustration studio originally based in New York City, but later expanding to Los Angeles, that originally produced advertising art and storyboards for motion pictures. While continuing to produce advertising art and storyboards for movies, Continuity Associates later became an art packager for such comic book publishers as Charlton and Marvel. After the founding of Continuity Associates in 1971 and the cancellation of Green Lantern in 1972, Neal Adams's work for DC and comic books in general became more sporadic. /He continued work on Batman through 1974. He would do later work on the character, including the mini-series Batman Odyssey in 2010 and 2011, Batman Odyssey Vol 2 in 2011 and 2012, Batman Black and White, vol. 2, no. 1 in 2013, and the mini-series Batman vs. Ra's al Ghul from 2019 to 2021. In 1972 he illustrated El Diablo stories for Weird Western Tales and the artwork for the story \"The Private Life of Clark Kent\" in Superman no. 254. He did a Human Target back up story in Action Comics no. 425 in 1973. He worked on House of Mystery no. 228 in 1975. Neal Adams illustrated public service pages for Justice Includes All Children in 1976. He was the artist for Superman Vs. Muhammad Ali in 1978. He provided art for Detective Comics Vol. 2, no. 27 in 2014.  He did a story for Harley's Little Black Book in 2016 and that same year provided art for the miniseries Superman: The Coming of the Supermen. He provided art for The Kamandi Challenge no. 2 in 2017. From 2017 to 2018 he was the artist on the Deadman miniseries. He also did some more work for Marvel, including Amazing Adventures in 1973, Dracula Lives no. 2 in 1973, Monsters Unleashed no. 3 in 1973, Conan the Barbarian no. 37 in 1974, The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu in 1974, Savage Tales no. 4 in 1974, Savage Sword of Conan in 1976, Crazy no 2 in 1974, Kull and the Barbarians no. 2 in 1975, Epic Illustrated no. 7 in 1981, X-Men Giant-Size No. 3 in 2005, Young Avengers no. 3 in 2005, New Avengers, vol. 2, no. 16 in 2011, First X-Men no. 15 from 2012 to 2013, and Fantastic Four: Antithesis #1–4 in 2020. He also did some work for Charlton, including Emergency! and The Six Million Dollar Man in 1976. From the Seventies to the Teens he would do occasional work for publishers from Atlas/Seaboard to Dark Horse to DIW.In addition to his work on comic books, he also did cover art for Ballantine Book's reprints of the Tarzan novels in the Seventies. In 1984 Neal Adams formed Continuity Comics. Besides Neal Adams, the company also published work by such creators as Vincente Alazar, Dan Barry, Esteban Maroto, Bart Sears, and others. The company lasted until 1994.Neal Adams was a vocal advocate for the rights of creators. As early as 1970 he attempted to unionize the industry. He was among the first to champion the return of original artwork to the artist, which would become an industry standard. In 1978 along with several others, he formed  the Comics Creators Guild, an attempt at a union for comic book creators. Ultimately, the Comics Creators Guild failed. Neal Adams was among those who lobbied for Superman creators to receive financial remuneration and credit as the creator of the character from DC Comics. Neal Adams was among the most influential comic books artists of all time, if not the most influential He was a mentor to both Frank Miller, Bill Sienkiewicz, and influenced such artists as John Byrne, Howard Chaykin,  Jose Luis Garcia-Lopez, and Jim Starlin. As to why Neal Adams influenced so many artists, it is simply that he was one of the artists to bring the realism to the pages of comic book. Neal Adams's work was a sharp break from the cartoony styles that had dominated comic books during the Golden Age and even into the Silver Age. His artwork was realistic and very detailed, from human anatomy to guns and vehicles. At the same time his work was infused with an energy rarely seen even in superhero comic books. More so than any other artist, Neal Adams's art was filled with drama.Of course, Neal Adams's impact went beyond his talent as an artist. With writer Dennis O'Neil, he returned Batman to his roots as a dark night avenger, setting the stage for everything from Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns to the \"Dark Knight\" film trilogy. Messrs. O'Neil and Adams also brought back Two-Face after a 17 year hiatus and took The Joker back to being the homicidal psychopath he had originally been. They also introduced such characters as Ra's al Ghul and his daughter Talia. With writer Frank Robbins, Neil Adams introduced the character of Man-Bat. While Dennis O'Neil revitalized Batman, they also brought relevance to the pages of Green Lantern, dealing with issues that had rarely, if ever, been addressed in comic books. It was in the pages of Green Lantern that Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams introduced DC's first Black superhero, the Green Lantern John Stewart. Neal Adam's achievements weren't limited to DC. When he was working on X-Men at Marvel, with Roy Thomas he introduced the character of Havok and brought back Magneto. While Neal Adams's run on X-Men would only last nine issues, it would have a lasting impact on the franchise.Neal Adams revolutionized comic books to such a point that saying that comic books today would not be the same without him is not mere hyperbole. He brought realism to comic books, revitalized several characters, and introduced yet others. If both the comic book industry and comic book fans are mourning him so, it is because he was just that important."},
{"title": "The Late Great James Bama", "date": "Thursday, April 28, 2022", "text": "Today would have been legendary artist James Bama's 96th birthday. Mr. Bama was a large part of my childhood. He painted the covers of many of the covers of Bantam Books' reprints of the Doc Savage novels that I read voraciously as a kid. He also painted the box art for the first several Universal Monster model kits put out by Aurora Plastics Corporation. And while I didn't know at the time, he was even responsible for promotional artwork for the TV show Star Trek, a poster of which adorned my bedroom wall. Sadly, James Bama died April 24 2022 at the age of 95.James Bama was born on April 28 1926 in Washington Heights, New York. He took an interest in art early, copying panels from Alex Raymond's comic strip Flash Gordon when he was growing up. He was only 15 when he made his first professional sale, a drawing of Yankee Stadium published in the New York Journal-American. He graduated from the High School of Music & Art in New York City. Following his graduation, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps. He served as a mechanic and also painted murals while in the service. After he was demobilized, James Bama went to study at the Art Students League in New York. Among his instructors was painter and illustrator Frank J. Reilly. His first illustration for a paperback was A Bullet for Billy the Kid in 1950. In the Fifties he also did covers for such men's adventure magazines as For Men Only, Man's World, Men, Stag and True Action. When he was 24 he went to work for Cooper Studios, an advertising studio that did artwork for advertisements for such companies as Coca-Cola, Ford Motors, and General Electric. He continued to work for Cooper Studios into the Sixties. In the Sixties James Bama continued to do covers for paperbacks. It was in 1961 that he created the box art for Aurora's first Universal Monsters model kit Frankenstein. He would continue to create box art for the Universal Monsters model kits, doing the first 22. In 1964 Bantam Books began publishing reprints of the Doc Savage pulp novels, starting with the first novel, The Man of Bronze. James Bama did that cover, and would ultimately create 62 covers for Bantam's Doc Savage reprints. He also continued to work for magazines, creating art work for such diverse publications as Argosy, Famous Monsters of Filmland, Readers Digest, and The Saturday Evening Post. Mr. Bama also worked in television, creating promotional work for both Bonanza and Star Trek. He also created the movie post for Cool Hand Luke. In 1968 James Bama and his wife moved to Wyoming. He began painting Western subjects, both historical and contemporary. It was in 1971 that Mr. Bama decided to leave the world of illustration so he could concentrate on easel painting. James Bama proved very successful as a Western artist, with books collecting his artwork published.Arguably, James Bama is one of the most popular artists of the mid to late 20th Century. His illustrations for the Doc Savage novels and his box art for the Aurora Universal Monster model kits both have cult followings. He also proved very successful as a Western artist. As both an illustrator and a painter he was a realist. Some of his artwork appeared so realistic that it could at times be mistaken for a photographs. His command of lighting in his artwork was only matched by a few other artists, and the colours in his artwork could often be intense. He was an ideal artist for paperback covers, but at the same time he was capable of producing truly great Western artwork. He certainly was one of the most talented illustrators and artists of the 20th Century.James Bama's cover art for Aurora's Dracula model kit.The cover of Bantam's reprint of the Doc Savage novel The Man of Bronze.James Bama's promotional artwork for Bonanza.James Bama's promotional artwork for Star Trek."},

{"title": "Wendy Goldman on ER", "date": "Sunday, April 24, 2022", "text": "It was 25 years ago today that Vanessa Marquez last appeared as Nurse Wendy Goldman on ER. The episode was \"Calling Dr. Hathaway.\" In the episode Wendy was helping the ER's desk clerk Jerry (Abraham Benrubi) and later physician assistant Jeanie Boulet (Gloria Reuben) catch a genetically engineered mouse that had escaped from the lab. At the time I doubt anyone, except for possibly the cast and crew of ER, realized it would be Vanessa's last episode. There was no publicity about her departure and Wendy Goldman simply disappeared from the show with very little explanation. Well before I ever knew Vanessa Marquez, Wendy Goldman was my favourite character on ER and I had a huge crush on her at the time. I definitely noticed Wendy's absence, wondering a few episodes into the fourth season where she was. I know from various friends and also various individuals online that Wendy was missed by a good many ER  fans. Despite Wendy's popularity, I noticed that the write-up on Wendy on the list of ER characters on Wikipedia is a mere stub. So too is the entry on Wendy on the ER wiki. This isn't unusual for the supporting characters--Nurse Lydia Wright (Ellen Crawford) was on the show for ten seasons and her wiki is a stub too. I then thought I would write my own wiki on Wendy Goldman, containing as much information as could be gleaned from the episodes as possible. Here it is.Nurse Wendy Goldman was a recurring character on ER in its first three seasons. At least in the first season Wendy was a student nurse. It seems likely that in the pilot, \"24 Hours,\" she had only been working at the hospital for a short time. At the very least, she seems unfamiliar with Dr. Ross (George Clooney). When Ross comes into the ER to be treated for drunkenness, she asks Dr. Greene (Anthony Edwards), \"Does he always do this?\" In \"Make of Two Hearts,\" when Wendy complains to Jerry about decorating the ER for Valentine's Day, she says, \"I'm not a nurse in training, I'm a nurse in decorating!\" The viewer is told nothing about Wendy's background or family. From Wendy Goldman's name, viewers might assume that she is part Jewish. At the same time, viewers would have good reason to assume that she was a Latina as well, aside from the fact that Vanessa Marquez was Mexican American. Wendy is fluent in Spanish and sometimes serves as a translator when needed. In \"Into That Good Night\" she comforts a Spanish speaking patient in her native language. In \"Love Among the Ruins\" she translates for a Spanish speaking father whose son has gotten a coat hanger caught in his throat. In \"Days Like This\" Jerry, who does not speak Spanish, asks Wendy to help with a Spanish speaking mother seeking information on her son, who is in the hospital. Wendy may have had a Jewish father (hence her name) and a Latina mother.Wendy is single. In \"Faith,\" when the nurses are negotiating a new contract with the hospital, Haleh (Yvonne Freeman) says that the nurses will stand firm as far as their demands for a new contract go. Wendy tells her, \"That's easy for you to say. You've got a husband with a job.\" It seems likely that for much of the time Wendy is working in the ER that she does not have a boyfriend either, at least going by how aggressively she flirts with dance instructor Mickey (Brian Wimmer) in \"Last Call.\"Wendy is sweet and soft hearted in demeanour, and often comforts patients. In \"Make of Two Hearts\" she holds a train victim's hand. Unfortunately, the train victim goes into a seizure and crushes her hand. Later when she is told that the train victim has died, she is sad. In \"Into that Good Night\" she stroked the hair of the aforementioned Spanish speaking patient, who had been involved in a car accident. In \"John Carter, M.D.\" it is Wendy who offers to call the parents of a little girl who was hit by car while riding her bicycle. In \"The Healers\" she admits to having cried when paramedics Shep (Ron Eldard) and Raul (Carlos Gómez) brought in a baby who died. Wendy's concern doesn't just extend to patients, but her co-workers in the ER as well. When Dr. Weaver (Laura Innes) is hit on the head by a falling clock, Wendy's first reaction is to ask, \"Are you alright?\" Wendy seems to be good with children. In \"Chicago Heat\" she reads Horton Hears a Who? to Dr. Greene's daughter Rachel. In \"Blizzard\" she is helping Patrick (Kevin Michael Richardson) entertain a little girl in the ER. While Wendy is sweet and soft hearted, she does have a temper. As mentioned above, in \"Make of Two Hearts,\" she complains about having to decorate the ER. Later in \"Make of Two Hearts,\" she snaps at medical student Deb Chen (Ming-Na Wen), who is high on acid, for not recognizing her when Deb is there to put a cast on her broken hand. In \"House of Cards\" she yells at medical student Deb Chen (Ming-Na Wen) when Deb attempts putting a central line into a patient's chest all by herself. In \"No Brain, No Gain\" Wendy shouts at Jerry and E-Ray (Charles Noland) when the two of them claim an MRI has somehow reversed E-Ray's polarity.  While viewers are never told about any friends Wendy might have outside the ER, she appears to be close to many of her fellow employees in the ER. This is particularly true of her fellow nurses. In \"Baby Shower\" she brings a gigantic box containing a gift to a baby shower held at Doc Magoo's for Conni (Conni Oligaro). In \"Welcome Back, Carter\" Chuny (Laura Cerón) shows Wendy pictures of her riding a jet ski (presumably the photos were from Chuny's vacation). In  \"Who's Appy Now?\" Chuny and Wendy gossip about Dr. Greene in a mixture of English and Spanish. Wendy also appears to be particularly close to desk clerk Jerry, who sometimes involves her in his various schemes. In \"Make of Two Hearts,\" when Wendy complains to Jerry about having to decorate the ER, he asks, \"Can I help?\" In \"No Brain, No Gain,\" an anthropologist doing a comparison study on the mating rituals of birds and humans thinks Wendy and Jerry are flirting, although given she later yells at Jerry it seems likely the anthropologist mistook two friends joking around for flirting. At the very least, Wendy treats Jerry very differently from Mickey in \"Last Call,\" in whom she was obviously interested. In \"Calling Dr. Hathaway\" Wendy helps Jerry put out live traps to catch the genetically engineered mouse and thus get a hefty financial reward.For the  most part Wendy maintains a professional demeanour with the medical students and doctors in the ER. She often assists Carter (Noah Wylie) and the two seem genuinely fond of each other. In \"Make of Two Hearts\" when Dr. Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) snatches Carter's many Valentines away from him and starts reading them off, \"Wendy\" is among the names of women who gave Valentines to Carter. While Wendy isn't an exceedingly rare name, it isn't very common either, so viewers may have been safe in assuming it was Wendy Goldman who gave Carter a Valentine. Even so, given neither Wendy nor Carter mention the Valentine, it seems safe to assume that if it was Wendy Goldman who sent it, it was meant as a platonic gesture. Indeed, when Ross compliments her on volunteering to decorate the ER (to which she replies, \"I didn't volunteer!\"), she stuffs a little heart in the pocket of his lab coat.  Later in \"Make of Two Hearts\" even as Carter laughs at the cast Deb put on Wendy's hand, he tells her, \"I'm sorry\" and says he that he will fix it the next day. Wendy also often assists Ross and in \"Luck of the Draw\" Ross seems comfortable enough to tell her he has a son he has never seen  In \"Night Shift\" Wendy assists Weaver with a night shift study. Wendy is intelligent, displaying a good deal of medical knowledge even when she was a student nurse. In \"Luck of the Draw,\" when Dr. Lewis tells Wendy to give her patient 350 milligrams of dopamine, Wendy corrects her and says, \"I think you mean micrograms.\" In \"House of Cards\" it is Wendy who determines that a junkie who was brought into the ER needs a central line, stating, \"He hasn't any veins left.\" When Wendy goes to get Dr. Lewis to put the central line in, Deb attempts to do the procedure herself, entirely botching it. In \"Men Plan, God Laughs,\" Dr. Greene asks if a patient has a peptic ulcer or a varices, Wendy correctly guesses he has a varices (although Haleh was correct in guessing he had a peptic ulcer--the patient had both). Wendy apparently enjoys learning new things. In \"Whose Appy Now?\" Wendy is reading info from a pamphlet on how often doctors wash their hands and even pick their noses. When she relays this information to Dr. Ross, he tells her that there is a limit to how informed he wants to be. While Wendy is very bright, in \"Welcome Back, Carter,\" Carol (Julianna Margulies) tells Wendy that she has to get her ALCS certification. Wendy doesn't know what ACLS is (for the curious, it is short for \"advanced cardiac life support\"). Chuny tells her not to worry, that she will love it.We only know a little about Wendy's pastimes and hobbies. In \"Blizzard,\" during a very slow period at the ER, Wendy rollerblades through the ER. She apparently likes baking and cooking. In \"Hell and High Water\" Wendy bakes brownies for the ER staff, although they might not be very good. When Carter takes a bite out of one he makes a face. In \"No Brain, No Gain\" Wendy makes salt water taffy for the ER staff. Her taffy seems to be better than her brownies. At the very least, Jerry and patient Mr. Percy (William Sanderson) like it. It seems likely Wendy enjoys playing video games and may actually be good at them. In \"Hell and High Water\" she is among the staff who plays Doom on the ER's new computer and even suggests to Carol when she is playing the game that she use the rocket launcher. Wendy also plays the lottery. In \"Luck of the Draw\" it is shown that she coordinates the ER staff's purchase of Lotto tickets. It also seems likely that Wendy is a fan of classic movies. In \"Last Call,\" when describing dance instructor Mickey to Jeannie, she compares Mickey to a combination of Dennis Quaid, Robert Redford, and James Dean. While Wendy may be a fan of classic films, she apparently is not a fan of the NBA. In  \"Baby Shower\" Jerry claims to have met Scotty Pippen, but no one believes him. When Scotty Pippen shows up in the ER, Jerry goes to alert the doctors. Unfortunately, Scotty Pippen leaves while Jerry is gone. When Jerry gets back to the front desk, he asks Wendy if she's seen him. Wendy simply asks, \"Is he kind of a tall guy?\"Wendy's talents go beyond the ER. In \"Do One, Teach One, Kill One,\" she is writing a cover story on Dr. Greene for the nursing newsletter. In \"Whose Appy Now?\" Wendy states that she has National Guard duty that weekend. Wendy Goldman last appeared on ER in \"Calling Dr. Hathaway.\" Viewers are never told why she left or what happened to her. In the fourth season episode \"Freak Show,\" Dr. Weaver tells Jeannie Boulet that Yoshi Takata (Gedde Watanabe) was hired to replace two nurses who left. It would be safe to assume Wendy was one of those nurses."},
{"title": "The Late Great Robert Morse", "date": "Thursday, April 21, 2022", "text": "I was a fan of Robert Morse long before he started playing Bert Cooper on Mad Men. I was a young adult when I first saw How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1967). I would later see him in such films as The Loved One (1965) and A Guide for the Married Man (1967). By the time of the first season of Mad Men, then, I was already an admirer of Mr. Morse. Of course, Mad Men would become one of my favourite shows, in a large part because of Robert Morse's performance as Bert. Sadly, Robert Morse died yesterday, April 20 2022 , at the age of 90.Robert Morse was born May 18 1931 in Newtown, Massachusetts. His mother, May, was a pianist. His father, Charles owned a chain of movie theatres. It was his music teacher Henry Lasker, at Newtown High School, who developed an interest in entertainment in young Robert Morse. During the Korean War he served in the United States Navy. Following the war, Mr, Morse moved to New York City where he trained at the American Theatre Wing. He got a job as a rehearsal singer for the game show Named That Tune. An agent heard him and signed him up. Robert Morse made his debut on Broadway in The Matchmaker in 1955.

{"title": "Noir Alley Returns This April on TCM", "date": "Friday, April 1, 2022", "text": "TCM's 31 Days Without Noir Alley 31 Days of Oscar ended yesterday, which means Noir Alley returns tomorrow, Saturday, April 2. I think I can speak for all Noir Alley fans when I say that we have been impatiently awaiting its return.Unfortunately, at least for those of us who watch Noir Alley on Saturday night, we will have to wait just a little bit longer. Tomorrow night Noir Alley airs late, at 11:45 PM Central/12:45 AM Eastern. Fortunately, it is a movie that has already aired on Noir Alley, although it is a good one. Pitfall (1948) stars Dick Powell as an ordinary employee of an insurance company who gets drawn into a nefarious plot by a particularly brutal private investigator (played by Raymond Burr). On Sunday Pitfall will air on Sunday at 9:00 AM Central/10:00 AM Eastern as usual.On Saturday, April 9 and Sunday, April 10 the 1955 French gangster film Bob le Flambeur airs on Noir Alley. Bob le flambeur centres on a former bank robber who, after twenty years of going straight, finds himself involved in another heist. On Saturday night, April 9, it also airs late, although not as late as Pitfall. It airs at 11:30 PM Central. On Sunday it airs at 9:00 AM as usual. On Saturday, April 16 and Sunday, April 17, Night and the City (1950) airs on Noir Alley. This is a must see. It is a gritty noir set in London and directed by Jules Dassin in which wrestling is central to the plot. Unfortunately, it also airs late on Saturday, at 11:30 PM Central/12:30 AM Eastern. It airs at 9:00 AM Central/10:00 AM Eastern as usual on Sunday. On Saturday, April 23 and Sunday, April 24 viewers will get to see Barbara Hale make a rare appearance in a noir. In The Window (1949) she plays the mother of a young boy who has a habit of crying wolf. Unfortunately for the boy, he witnesses an actual murder. The Window airs on Saturday at a time closer to Noir Alley's usual time, 11:15 PM Central/12:15 AM Eastern. It airs on Sunday at 9:00 AM/10 AM Eastern.Finally, Saturday, April 30 and Sunday, May 1 will see Noir Alley airing Johnny Angel (1946). In Johnny Angel, George Raft plays a ship captain who sets out to solve the murder of his father. Unfortunately it also airs late on Saturday, at 11:30 PM Central/12:30 AM Eastern. I am certainly glad that Noir Alley is back, especially given how good it's line-up is this month. That having been said, I really wish Turner Classic Movies would stop airing the Saturday night instalment so late. Not all of us enjoy staying up really late to watch Noir Alley, but we aren't morning people either, so getting up at 9:00 AM isn't exactly appealing. And, honestly, if they want to show two long movies back to back in primetime, they could always choose another night of the week than Satuday. As far as I cam concerned, Noir Alley on Saturday should never air later than 11:15 PM Central/12:15 PM Eastern."},

He also had a knack for directing TV shows, miniseries, and TV movies that dealt with difficult subjects, whether it was slavery, the holocaust, or a prison uprising. Much of Marvin J. Chomsky's work went well beyond mere entertainment."},

{"title": "For the First Time in Years I Did Not Watch the Oscars", "date": "Monday, March 28, 2022", "text": "Last night was the first time I did not watch the Academy Awards ceremony in decades. It had been a yearly ritual for my best friend Brian and I. After he died, I would exchange tweets with my dearest Vanessa Marquez while the ceremony aired live. I have continued watching the Academy Awards the past few years primarily out of fond memories of those times. Unfortunately, the Academy has been skating on thin ice with me for some time. Over the years they have snubbed many major stars in the on-air In Memoriam, from Andy Griffith in 2013 to Robert Vaughn in 2017. In 2019 they committed the greatest slight they could ever possibly have done to me by omitting my dearest Vanessa from the In Memoriam, despite the fact that a petition to include her had thousands of signatures. This year was the final straw. The American Broadcasting Company, better known as ABC, pressured the Academy of Motion Arts and Sciences to cut eight categories from the live ceremony. Worse yet, the Academy acquiesced to ABC rather than telling the network where to go. For me that was enough. The categories cut from the live ceremony were Sound, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score, Production Design, Documentary Short, Animated Short, and Live Action Short. These awards were given out before the show, with the award presentations and acceptance speeches edited and then aired during the live ceremony. As a film buff I am interested in every aspect of filmmaking. Editors, makeup artists, and production designers number among my heroes. I am also interested in short subjects as well as feature films. I then want so see the craft awards and the awards for the sorts given out at the live ceremony. The Academy's decision to cut these categories from the live ceremony then angered me. They should have told ABC to go to Hell.Indeed, in pressuring the Academy to cut these categories from the live ceremony, ABC made their contempt for film buffs clear. The Oscars are not simply a chance for the film industry to celebrate their achievements. It is a chance for film buffs to celebrate the cinema and the history of the cinema. We not only want to know what film won Best Picture or who won Best Actor, we want to know who won Best Film Editing and what won Best Animated Short. Quite simply, we want to see every single Oscar given out at the live ceremony, not film of them being given out before the show, even if it takes four hours.Of course, the bitter irony is that in pressuring the Academy to cut the eight categories from the live ceremonies, ABC probably lost a good section of the core audience for the Oscars, all in pursuit of an audience who not only doesn't care about the Oscars, but doesn't care about movies either. I know I was not the only devoted film buff who did not watch the Academy Awards ceremony last night. I know of several others as well. In fact, I have to wonder how many people did not watch it. I can't be certain, but I don't recall the Oscars trending on Twitter last night, other than a certain incident I won't discuss here. It usually does.As if cutting eight categories from the live ceremony last night was not enough, last night's In Memoriam may well have been the worst I have ever seen. The In Memoriam segment featured dancers and upbeat songs hardly suitable for a memorial. I love the song \"Spirit in the Sky,\" but I really do not want to hear it played during what should be a solemn event. Indeed, in some ways I found the whole In Memoriam segment disrespectful, even though I don't think that was the intention at all. What was disrespectful about this year's on air In Memoriam were the omissions of beloved individuals. Ed Asner may have been best known for his work in television, but he made over eighty movies and was a two time president of the Screen Actors Guild as well. They also omitted Michael Nesmith (who produced movies as well as made music), Willie Garson, Bob Saget, and Norm MacDonald. While omitting these individuals, they made sure to include talent managers and agents that most Academy members and certainly the audience probably haven't heard of.Fortunately, not everything last night at the Oscars was a catastrophe. There was a touching moment between Lady Gaga and Liza Minnelli when they presented the Oscar for Best Picture. Miss Minnelli had viral encephalitis and was having some difficulty, but Lady Gaga was entirely supportive of the legend. Once I heard about it today, I had to check out the video.There were also several historic wins. Jane Campion became only the third woman to win the Oscar for Best Director. Troy Kostur became the first deaf man to win an acting award when he won Best Supporting Actor for Coda. Ariana DeBose became the first Afro-Latina and the first queer person of colour to win an acting award when she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for West Side Story (2021). Her win also made her and Rita Moreno the first pair of actresses to win the Best Supporting Actress for the same role in different movies. With regards to the Academy Awards, ABC has become so focused on ratings that they have lost sight of the whole purpose of the Oscars. They have ignored the fact that the Academy Awards are not simply a chance for the film industry to celebrate their achievements, but for film buffs to celebrate the cinema. In doing so they run the risk of losing the one group of people who were guaranteed to watch the Oscars every single year. If ABC wants the Academy Awards ceremony's ratings to improve, they should leave the Academy alone and let the Academy return the Oscars to their former glory. I think I can speak for most film buffs when I say that we don't care if it takes four hours."},
{"title": "Five Shows That Should be Available on Streaming", "date": "Saturday, March 26, 2022", "text": "Sometimes its seems as if every TV show ever made is on streaming. After all, one can watch a show as obscure as Camp Runamuck on Tubi. In fact, there is a good deal that is not available on streaming. What is more, many of the TV series not to found on streaming services are not exactly obscure. Here are five shows that are not available on streaming, but should be.Culture Clash: Culture Clash was a sketch variety show starring the comedy troupe of that name. It aired on Fox stations starting in 1993. Sadly, Culture Clash has not been available ever since it aired in the Nineties. It really should be made available. First, it was one of the first shows to star Chicanos. This was well before George Lopez, let alone such shows as Vida and Gentefied. Second, it was one of the first shows to be produced and written by Chicanos as well (among them legendary cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz). Of course, on a personal level I would like for Culture Clash to become available on streaming (and DVD as well) because my dearest Vanessa Marquez was a regular on the show. For those curious about the show, there are clips to be found on YouTube, some of which Vanessa uploaded herself.Empty Nest: Empty Nest was a spinoff of The Golden Girls starring Richard Mulligan as paediatrician Dr. Harry Weston, whose adult daughters moved back in with him. The show was one of NBC's hits in the late Eighties, ranking no, 9 in the Nielsens for the year in its fist two seasons and no. 7 for its third season. Its ratings would decline afterwards, but it still managed to run seven seasons. Despite its success, Empty Nest aired for a time on the Hallmark Channel, but has since largely disappeared from syndication and has never been released on DVD. He & She: While it only lasted one season, He & She remains well remembered by many. The show starred real life married couple Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss as Dick and Paula Hollister. Dick was a cartoonist whose comic strip Jetman has been adapted into a TV show starring the vain, but not particularly bright Oscar North (Jack Cassidy). Paula worked for the Tourist Aid Society, making her one of the first married women to work outside the home in American television.  He & She debuted on CBS on September 6 1967 to critical acclaim. It even won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Comedy and was nominated for four more Emmy Awards. Unfortunately, none of this prevented CBS from cancelling the show. CBS would rerun it during the summer of 1970 and it would later pop up on both the USA Network and TV Land. Sadly, it has never been released on DVD, nor is it on any streaming services. All we have are episodes that have been uploaded to YouTube.Nurses: Just as Empty Nest was a spinoff of The Golden Girls, Nurses was a spinoff of Empty Nest. It centred on a group of nurses working in a hospital in Miami (the same hospital as Dr. Weston of Empty Nest). Nurses debuted on September 14 1991 on NBC and ran for three seasons. Nurses received modest ratings until its third and final season. Reruns of the show aired on Lifetime for a while after its initial network run, but it hasn't really been available since. Like Empty Nest, it hasn't been released on DVD, although there are a few episodes on YouTube. Of course, here I have to say I have a personal reason for wanting Nurses available on streaming. Vanessa guest starred on the third season episode \"The One After the Earthquake.\"Sea Hunt: From the Forties into the early Sixties, several hit shows were released through first-run syndication in the United States. Among the last of the hit shows to emerge from the first wave of first-run syndication shows in the Fifties and Sixties was Sea Hunt. The show was created and produced by Ivan Tors, who would later produce such shows as Flipper and Daktari. It starred Lloyd Bridges as former Navy frogman Mike Nelson. Plots on the show ranged from underwater salvage missions to facing criminals. Sea Hunt proved to be very popular and ran for four seasons. Unlike other shows on this list, Sea Hunt is available on DVD. It has also been available on streaming in the past. Currently, it is available on no streaming services."},

In his guest appearances on The Avengers the characters he played were dramatically different. He particularly stood out as Thyssen, the diabolical mastermind who claims to have created a time machine in \"Escape in Time.\" In the movie Blowup he gave a good performance as Ron, photographer Thomas's agent. Of course, chances are good that the will always be remembered as Richard DeVere  on To Manor Born, the millionaire supermarket chain owner. It was a role that he excelled in. Chances are good that he will also be remembered as the somewhat irresponsible Sir Guthrie Featherstone, who often found himself at odds with barrister Rumple on Rumpole of the Bailey. Peter Bowles could play everything from villains to heroes, and could play comedy as well as drama. He was an incredible actor."},

{"title": "Maverick: \"Hadley's Hunters\"", "date": "Saturday, March 19, 2022", "text": "(This post is part of the 8th Annual Favourite TV Show Blogathon hosted by A Shroud of Thoughts)(Ever since I started the 8th Annual Favourite TV Show Blogathon, I have written about an episode from a different show each year. This is the first time I am repeating myself. For the 3rd Annual Favourite TV Show Blogathon I wrote about the Maverick  episode \"Gun-Shy.\" I hadn't planned on writing about another Maverick episode this year. In fact, I had planned to write about a WKRP in Cincinnati episode in honour of the late Howard Hesseman. It was last week that someone much closer to myself and the classic film and TV community died than Mr. Hesseman. Patricia Nolan Hall, known to her friends as Paddy Lee and known for her blog Caftan Woman, passed on last week. Those of you who knew Paddy probably also know that both Maverick  and Perry Mason numbered among her favourite shows. I then decided to write about a Maverick episode for this blogathon. Paddy Lee, this one is for you.--Terence)Bart Maverick and Bronco Lane Among the TV Westerns of the Fifties, Maverick was unique. The heroes of most Westerns of the era were brave, often humourless lawmen or drifters (who often differed from the lawmen only in that they weren't professionals). The heroes of Maverick were the Maverick brothers, Brett (James Garner) and Bart (Jack Kelly), who were gamblers by profession. The Mavericks preferred to get out of situations using their wits instead of their guns or fists, often with plenty of humour. And while both Bret and Bart were honest themselves, they were not below concocting a long con against those who were not honest themselves. Bret and Bart Maverick were then very different from the other heroes of Western TV shows in the Fifties. The tone of the show was different as well. Maverick was played tongue in cheek.The episodes of Maverick usually centred on one brother or the other, with Bret and Bart teaming up in a few. The episode \"Hadley's Hunters\" is a fourth season episode, by which time Bart was the sole remaining Maverick.. In \"Hadley's Hunters\" Sheriff Hadley (Edgar Buchanan) has an ongoing scheme in which his deputies will commit various robberies and then the sheriff pins it on some innocent victim. Bart has the misfortune of coming upon a stagecoach robbery committed by one of Hadley's deputies. Sheriff Hadley then gives Bart an ultimatum. He has five days to capture the \"bandit\" behind the robbery (in this case, Cherokee Dan Evans, played by Robert Colbert) or face the gallows himself.Maverick was one of several Westerns produced by Warner Bros. for the network ABC. What set Warner Bros.' Westerns apart from Western TV shows produced by other studios is that the Warner Bros. Westerns all took place in a shared universe. The \"Warner Bros. Shared Universe\" (for lack of a better term) was born when Bret Maverick appeared in the Sugarfoot episode \"Misfire\" on December 10 1957. Afterwards Warner's Western heroes would appear from time to time on the Westerns of other Warner Western heroes: Bart appeared on Sugarfoot; Tom \"Sugarfoot\" Brewster (Will Hutchins) appeared on several episodes of Cheyenne; Christopher Colt (Wayde Preston), the hero of Colt .45, appeared several times on Sugarfoot; and so on.\"Hadley's Hunters\" went further than any episode of any Warner Bros. Westerns before in featuring very nearly every Warner Bros. Western hero except Bret Maverick. In tracking down Cherokee Dan, Bart seeks help from various characters from other Warner Bros. Western series. He visits Marshal Dan Troop (John Marshall) and his deputy Johnny McKay of Lawman in their office in Laramie. He catches Tom \"Sugarfoot\" Brewster reading a law book outside a building. Bart tries to catch Cheyenne Bodie (Clint Walker) of the show Cheyenne while riding to no avail. He catches Bronco Lane (Ty Hardin) of Bronco in the street after being thrown out of a saloon in a brawl. Bart then visits a dust and cobweb covered office where there is a briefcase belonging to Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company. The scene is a clear reference to the TV show Colt .45. Its hero Sam Colt Jr. (Donald May) is apparently long gone. Here it must be pointed that Colt .45 had recently been cancelled. The final cameo is perhaps the funniest. Bart visits a stable called \"77 Cherokee Strip\" and talks to a stable hand played by Edd Byrnes Of course, Edd Byrnes played Kookie on Warner Bros.' detective series 77 Sunset Strip. Much like Warner Bros.' Westerns, their detective shows also existed in their own shared universe, with characters from 77 Sunset Strip appearing on Hawaiian Eye and so on. Edd Byrne's appearance in \"Hadley's Hunters\" would seem to indicate that Warner Bros.' Westerns and detective shows take place in the same reality. Okay, the stable hand clearly cannot be Kookie (not unless he found the Fountain of Youth), but he could easily be Kookie's grandfather or great grandfather.Warner Bros. shows weren't the only ones referenced in \"Hadley's Hunters.\" Played tongue in cheek, it was not unusual for Maverick to make references to other TV shows, Indeed, several episodes were parodies of other TV series, including \"A Cure for Johnny Rain\" (a parody of Dragnet),  the aforementioned \"Gun-Shy\" (a parody of Gunsmoke), and \"Three Queens Full\" (a parody of Bonanza). In \"Hadley Hunters\" a weaponless Bart asks a bartender for any weapons, but the only thing he has is a sawed-off shotgun called \"a  Mule's Foot or something like that\" left behind by some bounty hunter. The scene is a clear swipe at the popular CBS Western Wanted: Dead or Alive, on which bounty hunter Josh Randall (Steve McQueen) used a rifle with a shortened barrel called a \"Mare's Leg.\"As interesting as the appearances of Warner Bros.' Western heroes are, \"Hadley's Hunters\" features another interesting bit of casting. Cherokee Dan is played by Robert Colbert, who would later be cast as the \"lost\" Maverick brother Brent Maverick. In the fourth season, after Roger Moore (who played cousin Beau Maverick) departed the series, Warner Bros. attempted to introduce another Maverick brother. Brent Maverick was played by Robert Colbert and was little more than a clone of Bret. Robert Colbert was not particularly anxious to play the role, knowing that the character would not be well received. As it turned out, Robert Colbert was right. Brent only appeared in two episodes.Of course, beyond the various Warner Bros. Western characters and Robert Colbert, \"Hadley's Hunters\" featured some interesting casting. Edgar Buchanan excels as Sheriff Hadley, who is not only crooked but down right narcissistic. Indeed, not only is the town named for him, but he has his own biographer, Copes, played by Howard McNear (who had played Doc on the radio version of Gunsmoke and would later play Floyd the Barber on The Andy Griffith Show). George Kennedy, who would go onto a successful movie career, played one of Hadley's deputies, Jones. While Maverick was not as good in its fourth season as it once was, \"Hadley's Hunters\" demonstrates that it was still capable of churning out fine episodes. \"Hadley's Hunters\" is a good combination of action and humour, precisely what one wants from a Maverick episode. And it certainly holds the record for the biggest crossover of any Warner Bros. Western TV series."},

{"title": "The Late Great Emilio Delgado", "date": "Tuesday, March 15, 2022", "text": "Emilio Delgado, who played Fix-It Shop owner Luis on Sesame Street for 45 years, died on March 10 2022 at age 81 from multiple myeloma.Emilio Delgado was born on May 8 1940 in Calexico, California. He spent much of his childhood in Mexicali, Mexico with his grandparents. He worked in his grandfather's bicycle shop and also shined shoes growing up. When he was a teenager his parents moved to Glendale, California. In high school he was president of the Thespian Club, acted in high school productions, and played trombone in the school's bands. He studied theatre at California Institute of the Arts. He also performed as a guitarist and singer with various Mexican trios.Emilio Delgado began his professional acting career in summer stock. He was cast on the KCET drama Cancion de la Raza, which ran from 1968 to 1969. Early in his career he was the artistic director for the Barrio Theatre of East L.A. He made his commercial television debut in 1970 in a guest appearance on Storefront Lawyers. It was in 1971 that Emilio Delgado was cast as Luis, a handyman and an aspiring writer, on Sesame Street. He ran the L&R Fix-It Shop with Rafael (played by Raul Julia). Raul Julia left Sesame Street after one year, after which Luis became the sole owner of the Fix-It Shop. In the Seventies Emilio Delgado also guest starred on the shows Police Story, Cannon, Hawaii Five-O, ABC Weekend Specials, Delvecchio, The Chilsholms, Born to the Wind, and Quincy M.E. Towards the end of the decade and into the Eighties, Emilio Delgado played  national news editor Rubin Castillo on Lou Grant. In the Eighties Emilio Delgado continued to appear as Luis on Sesame Street and Rubin Castillo on Lou Grant. He guest starred on Falcon Crest. He made his film debut playing Luis in the Sesame Street movie Follow That Bird (1985). In the Nineties Emilio Delgado continued to appear as Luis on Sesame Street.

He also preformed with the band Pink Martini at various concerts and sang on their album Splendor in the Grass. Emilio Delgado was a true pioneer. At the time that Luis first appeared on Sesame Street the majority of roles available to Chicanos or Mexican Americans were either bandidos or cholos. Luis was a sharp contrast to these roles. He was friendly, tender-hearted, and happy. He often entertained the residents of Sesame Street with his songs. At at time when most Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and Chicanos on television were outright stereotypes, Luis was a distinctly original character. He gave Mexican American children and Latinos in general a character with whom they had much in common. What is more, Emilio Delgado's roles on various other shows, such as Rubin Castillo, were not stereotypes either. He paved the way for Mexican Americans and Latinos in general in Hollywood, playing characters who were not at all stereotypical."},
{"title": "Godspeed Johnny Brown", "date": "Monday, March 14, 2022", "text": "Johnny Brown, perhaps best known as a regular on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In and housing project superintendent Nathan Bookman on the classic sitcom Good Times, died on March 2 at the age of 84. Johnny Brown was born on June 11 1937 in St. Petersburg, Florida. He grew up in Harlem. He won an amateur talent competition at the Apollo Theatre. This led to a nightclub act with his wife June Russell, as well as tap dancer Gregory Hines Jr. and drummer Gregory Hines Sr. It was while he was working in the Catskills that he befriended Sammy Davis Jr., who became his mentor. Johnny Brown toured with saxophonist Sam \"The Man\" Taylor starting in 1958. In 1961 Mr. Brown's first single \"Walkin', Talkin', Kissin' Doll\" was released by Columbia Records. Another single, \"You're Too Much in Love With Yourself,\" was released by Atlantic Records in 1968. It was through his mentor Sammy Davis Jr. that Johnny Brown made his Broadway debut. Sammy Davis Jr. was set to star in the production Golden Boy alongside comedian Godfrey Cambridge. Mr. Davis then got Mr. Brown a job as Mr. Cambridge's understudy. Godfrey Cambridge was not particularly eager to do the play and as a result began constantly arguing with director Arthur Penn. Only two days before Golden Boy was set to premiere, Godfrey Cambridge was fired and Johnny Brown took his place in the play. In 1968 Johnny Brown again appeared on Broadway in Carry Me Back to Morningside Heights. Johnny Brown made his movie debut in A Man Called Adam in 1968. In the Sixties he also appeared in the movie The Out-of-Towners (1970). It was in 1970 that he became a regular on the TV show Laugh-In. He remained with the show through its fifth season. In the Sixties he also guest starred on the shows  Julia and Love, American Style. He also appeared on such variety shows as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Sammy Davis Show, The Leslie Uggams Show, Della, and The Merv Griffin Show. He began the Seventies continuing to appear on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. It was in 1975 that he started playing Nathan Bookman on the sitcom Good Times. He remained with the show until it ended its run in 1979. In the Seventies Johnny Brown guest starred on Love, American Style; Night Gallery; Maude; The Rookies; Lotsa Luck!; Get Christie Love!; The Ghost Busters; The Lost Saucer; Chico and the Man; and Monster Squad. He provided voices for the Saturday morning cartoon The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show. He was a guest on the variety shows Dinah!, Flip, and Sammy and Company. He appeared in the movie The Wiz (1978). In the Eighties Johnny Brown guest starred on Gimme a Break!, Archie Bunker's Place, The Jeffersons, Insight, Fantasy Island, Punky Brewster, Moonlighting, and 227. He provided voices for the Saturday morning cartoon Alvin & The Chipmunks. He appeared in the movies Body and Soul (1981) and Hanky Panky (1982). In the Nineties Johnny Brown guest starred on the shows Out All Night; Martin; Family Matters; On Our Own; Hangin' with Mr. Cooper; Sister, Sister; The Jamie Foxx Show; The Wayan Brothers; Touched by an Angel; Cousin Skeeter; The Parent 'Hood; and Keenan & Kel. He appeared in the movie Life (1999).In the Naughts Mr. Brown guest starred on the shows The Parkers, Baby Boy, and Everybody Loves Chris. He appeared in the movies Town & Country (2001), I'm Through with White Girls (2007), and Man in the Mirror (2008). His final appearance on screen was in the movie In Da Cut (2013). Chances are good that Johnny Brown will always be remembered as Bookman on Good Times, which is in some ways sad. It is true that he was excellent in the role, but it ignores the fact that he did so much more in his career. He shined as one of the cast members of Laugh-In and displayed his comic versatility on such other shows as Love, American Style. In addition to being a gifted comedian and actor, Johnny Brown was also a talented singer. His singles can be found on YouTube and they demonstrate that he had an incredible voice. While it seems likely he will always be remembered for Good Times, he did so much more."},

He could be suitably menacing as Burke Devlin on Dark Shadows, but then be hilarious as the boozy, eccentric Edward Montgomery on Dharma & Greg. He could be a base villain as General McAllister in Lethal Weapon, but he could play a hero like Captain Chase Reddick on the TV show Chase. He was as adept as comedy as he was drama. Over the years he played everything from medical doctors to servicemen to priests, and he played all of them well."},
{"title": "My Birthday", "date": "Thursday, March 10, 2022", "text": "Today is my birthday and I must say it is a bittersweet one. On the one hand I have enjoyed today for the most part. On the other hand, my birthday has been coloured by three deaths in my life this week. The first I have already written about on this blog. Paddy Lee was loved by the classic film and classic TV blogger community and I know I can speak for all of us when I saw we will miss her. The second was an old pal from the late, lamented social network Google+. Chris Kim was an expatriate Missourian, so he could relate to many of my references to the state. He also had a great, if twisted, sense of humour, much as I do. Politically we agreed on just about everything (like me, he was a progressive). Chris was extremely proud of his nieces and he had reason to be. They are all accomplished, young women. The third person to die was my cousin Bernita. Bernita was my Aunt Annie's daughter. I really didn't know Bernita very well, as she moved to Wichita when I was really young (maybe before I was born). Still, she was kin and it is sad to know she is gone.Of course, as usual I am thinking of my dearest friend Vanessa Marquez on this day. She always wished me, \"Happy birthday,\" and always figured out a special way to do it. I still miss her so terribly it hurts. I watched her movie Twenty Bucks (1993) today as a means of spending the day with her. Tonight I will watch Stand and Deliver (1988), which celebrates its 34th anniversary tomorrow. It was released the day after my 25th birthday. I hope I don't sound too downbeat here, as I don't feel that way. As I said earlier, I have enjoyed most of today. I have received several birthday greetings online and offline. My friends and siblings have made sure that today has been special for me. Particularly when one has experienced loss it is easy to forget about the good things in life, and there are many good things. It might seem odd, but its on my birthday as well as at Christmastime that I often think about the movie It's Wonderful Life (1946). To me the ultimate message of that film is Clarence's note to George in the copy of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer he gave him: \"Remember, George, no man is a failure who has friends.\" I think that is something important for all of us to remember."},
{"title": "The Late Great Paddy Lee, Caftan Woman", "date": "Monday, March 7, 2022", "text": "It was this afternoon on Twitter that I received the sad news that my friend Paddy Lee had died today. I am not sure how long we had known each other, but she was a long time blogger like myself. She ran the blog Caftan Woman. If the blog sounds familiar, it is because she participated in just about every blogathon I held and often commented on this blog. In addition to being a prolific blogger, she also read many blogs. It was not unusual for Paddy to comment on a post when no one else had. She also participated in many blogathons over the years. In addition to blogging, Paddy was also active on Twitter. She often tweeted about classic film and classic television and interacted with several fellow classic film and classic television fans. Paddy was a huge fan of Westerns going all the way back to the Silent Era. As might be expected, she was a fan of the television Westerns of the Fifties as well. In fact, I think she may well have been the biggest fan of Maverick I ever knew. She wrote several posts on the show. In fact, her final post, from a few days ago, was on the Maverick episode \"The Savage Hills.\" Paddy's tastes were diverse. She was as comfortable with an old Hollywood musical like 42nd Street (1933) as she was an episode of Perry Mason. Her tastes were similar to mine, so I knew a movie was good if Paddy liked it.Paddy suffered from kidney disease for many years and last year she even had a kidney transplant. She had been off Twitter since February due to issues with her health. For all the problems with her health Paddy had, she always maintained a sunny disposition. She was always eager to compliment her friends and always the first to say a kind word when one needed it. She was one of the most supportive people I have ever known. To put it in simply, Paddy was a real pal.This evening I know that many in the classic film and the classic TV community are mourning Paddy's passing. She enriched all of our lives with her positivity and her enthusiasm for classic movies and classic TV shows. I think I can speak for all of us when I say we will miss her terribly. My deepest condolences go out to her family and many friends."},

Tim Considine was born on December 31 1940 in Los Angeles, California His father, John W. Considine Jr., was a producer for MGM. His grandfather, John Considine, was a vaudeville impresario.

That same year he made his television debut in an episode of the show I'm the Law. He made guest appearances on the shows The Ford Television Theatre, Your Jeweler's Showcase, Chevron Theatre, The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, The Great Gildersleeve, and Treasury Men in Action.

Along with The Phantom of the Opera (1925), it may well be the most famous silent horror movie of all time. It is also one of the most famous adaptations of Bram Stoker's Dracula, despite being wholly unauthorized. Despite a successful copyright infringement lawsuit by Bram Stoker's widow Florence Stoker, Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des Grauens would prove to be one of the most influential, if not the most influential, vampire movie of all time.Indeed, it was Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des Grauens that introduced the idea that vampires can be destroyed by sunlight (it isn't found in folkore). I have already written several posts mentioning Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des Grauens, so I won't repeat myself here.

{"title": "Godspeed Gary Brooker", "date": "Thursday, March 3, 2022", "text": "Gary Brooker, the leader of the band Procol Harum died on February 19 at the age of  76. The cause was cancer. He was the only member of Procol Harum to remain with the band for the entirety of its history.Gary Brooker was born on May 29 1945 in Hackney, East London. He spent his early years in Hackney before his family moved to Middlesex. His father played steel guitar with  Felix Mendelssohn's Hawaiian Serenaders. Gary Brooker was still very young when he learned to play piano, cornet, and trombone. In 1945 his family moved to Southend-on-Sea, Essex. He attended Southend Municipal College, where he studied zoology and botany, but he left the college to become a professional musician. In the early Sixties Gary Brooker and guitarist Robin Trower founded The Paramounts. The Paramounts had a single hit with a cover of The Coasters' \"Poison Ivy.\" The Paramounts disbanded in 1966. That same year Gary Brooker formed Procol. Harum with Keith Reid. It was their manager, Guy Stevens, who came up with the band's name, taking it from the name of a Burmese cat owned by one of their friends, Liz Coombes. Their debut single, \"A Whiter Shade of Pale,\" proved to be one of the most successful records of all time. The song hit no. 1 on the UK singles chart and no. 1 in several other countries as well. It reached no. 5 on the Billboard  Hot 100. Their first album, Procol Harum, reached no. 26. Procol Harum never again repeated the success of \"A Whiter Shade of Pale,\" but they would see a good deal of success over the years. Into the early Seventies Procol Harum's albums regularly reached the top fifty of the UK album chart. The band also did well with regards to their singles. Their second single,\"Homburg,\" reached no. 6 on the UK singles chart. Their 1972 single \"Conquistador\" reached no. 22 on the UK singles chart. In 1975 \"Pandora's Box\" reached no. 16. From 1967 to 2017 Procol Harum disbanded in 1977. They reformed in 1991. In all , between 1967 and 2017, they  released 20 studio albums.While Procol Harum was disbanded, Gary Brooker released three solo albums: No More Fear of Flying (1979), Lead Me to the Water (1982), and Echoes in the Night (1985). Here leased one live album, Within Our House, in 1996. Over the years he contributed to the albums of others, from George Harrison's All Things must Pass to The Alan Parsons Project's Stereotomy to Kate Bush's Aerial. Gary Brooker was nothing if not versatile. \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" has been classed as \"baroque pop.\" Yet other songs have been counted as progressive rock or psychedelia. Yet other songs show influence from British music halls, the blues, and classical music. It was because of Gary Brooker's diverse styles that it was difficult to pigeonhole Mr. Brooker or Procol Harum in any one genre. Although they were often classed as progressive rock, they played everything from psychedelia to jazz rock. A pianist rivalled by none and a composer capable of a diverse number of styles Gary Brooker was extremly talented."},
{"title": "The Late Great Veronica Carlson", "date": "Tuesday, March 1, 2022", "text": "Among the many actresses to appear in the Hammer Horrors, Veronica Carlson numbered among fans' favourites. She was a frequent guest at conventions, where she became known for her friendliness and her respect for her fans. I never had the opportunity to meet Miss Carlson, but I know people who did. What is more, Veronica Carlson and I had mutual friends. All of them adored her. Sadly, Veronica Carlson died on February 27 2022 at the age of 77. Veronica Carlson was born Veronica Mary Glazer on September 18 1944 in Yorkshire. Her father was stationed in West Germany, so she spent much of her childhood there. She attended Thetford Girls' School and the High Wycombe College of Technology and Design, where she studied art. Veronica Carlson worked as a model which led to bit parts in Casino Royale  (1967) and Smashing Time (1967). James Carreras of Hammer Production noticed a photo of Miss Carlson emerging out of the waves in a bikini that had appeared in a tabloid. She went in for an audition was was cast in the film Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968). In the late Sixties she also appeared in the movies Hammerhead (1968), Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969), The Best House in London (1969), Crossplot (1969), Pussycat, Pussycat, I Love You (1970), and The Horror of Frankenstein (1970). She made her television debut in an episode of ITV Playhouse. She guest starred on The Saint, Department S, and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). In the Seventies Veronica Carlson was a regular on the British TV series Spyder's Web. She also guest starred on Hine and Public Eye. She appeared in the films Vampira (1974) and The Ghoul (1975). In the mid-Seventies she went into semi-retirement. She moved to the Unites States and later settled in South Carolina. Miss Carlson was an accomplished and successful painter.Veronica Carlson would return to film, appearing the movies Black Easter (1994), Freakshow (1995), Stellar Quasar and the Scrolls of Dadelia (2016), and House of the Gorgon (2019). She was set to appear in the movie The Refractory. Veronica Carlson was a very good actress. In Dracula Has Risen from the Grave, she played the niece of a priest who very nearly comes under Dracula's control. In Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed she played the landlady Anna, who has the misfortune of having Dr. Frankenstein as a tenant. While The Horror of Frankenstein is a lesser effort from Hammer, she did well as Elizabeth in the film. In The Saint episode \"The Man Who Gambled with Life,\" she was impressive as the daughter of an eccentric entrepreneur. As mentioned earlier, Veronica Carlson was a favourite at conventions. Also as I mentioned earlier, we had mutual friends. They were all unanimous in their adoration of Miss Carlson. She was beautiful and elegant even as she grew older, yet she was so unassuming that one would not realize she was a well known actress if they did not know better. Miss Carlson also had a wonderful sense of humour. She was known for her kindness and thoughtfulness, and when someone talked to her, they had her total attention. Veronica Carlson was certainly known for her beauty, from those who met her and her close friends, she was a woman who had a beautiful soul as well."},
{"title": "Hellhound on My Trail by Robert Johnson", "date": "Sunday, February 27, 2022", "text": "\"Hellhound on My Trail\" is one of bluesman Robert Johnson's most famous songs. There are many who consider it his greatest song. The song begins with the usual blues rope of a rambling musician before shifting to imagery of him being pursued by a hellhound. The song was recorded on June 30 1927 in Dallas, Texas. It was not only the first song Robert Johnson recorded that day, but the first song from that recording session to be released.The imagery of hellhounds has been used in Christian sermons at least from the late Middle Ages. Cerberus, who guarded the gates of Hades in Greek mythology, is even placed by Dante as guarding the third circle of Hell in The Inferno. In addition to Cerberus and with particular regards to Northern Europe, the image of the hellhound could also possibly have its roots in Garm, the dog who guards the entrance to Hel in Norse mythology. References to hellhounds would later be found in Puritan sermons of the 18th Century and would persist into the 19th and 20th Centuries. In fact, hellhounds were mentioned in blues and spiritual songs prior to Robert Johnson's \"Hellhound on My Trail.\" In 1926 The Biddleville University Quintettes's religious song \"Show Pity Lord\" contains the line \"The hellhound has turned back off my trail.\" \"Devil Blues\" by Sylvester Weaver contains the line, \"Hellhounds start to chase me man, I was a running fool, My ankles caught on fire, couldn't keep my puppies cool.\" While hellhounds played a large role in Christian sermons and were references in song prior to \"Hellhound on My Trail,\" what gives the song great significance is the legend that Robert Johnson had sold his soul to the devil for skill with the guitar. Here it must be pointed out that Robert Johnson was not the only bluesman about whom a Faustian legend had sprung up or even the only musician. Legends that 18th and 19th Century Italian violinist Niccolò Paganini had sold his soul to the Devil were current even in in his lifetime. The Catholic Church in Genoa took the legend so seriously that when Paganini died, he was denied a Catholic burial. Even an appeal to the Pope would not result in the burial of the violinist's body. He would not be buried until 1876, 36 years after his death. According to LeDell Johnson, the brother of Tommy Johnson, Tommy Johnson had claimed to have sold his soul to the Devil (here it must be pointed out that Robert Johnson and Tommy Johnson were unrelated). The legend of Robert Johnson selling his soul to the Devil often varies and it is unclear whether it was current during his lifetime or even shortly after his lifetime. Some scholars believe it originated in the Fifties and Sixties, when white fans rediscovered Robert Johnson and his music. As mentioned earlier, version of the legend vary. Some claim that Robert Johnson took his guitar to a crossroads on a plantation (often cited as Dockery Plantation, but also others as well), where he met the Devil (who is often portrayed as a large Black man). Robert Johnson gave his guitar to the Devil, who tuned it and played a few songs on it, then handed it back to Mr. Johnson. As to idea that Robert Johnson's deal with the Devil took place at a crossroads, that part of the legends may have its roots in Robert Johnson's song \"Cross Road Blues.\" Of course, it must be pointed out that in some variations of the legend it is not a crossroads were Robert Johnson meets the Devil, but a cemetery. The legend that Robert Johnson had sold his soul to the Devil has been used to explain how he mastered the guitar so quickly. What the legends ignores is that Robert Johnson spent a few years learning how to play guitar better from such blues legends as Ike Zimmerman. Even if one believes in the Devil, there are more rational explanations for Robert Johnson's expertise with the guitar than selling his soul. Regardless, \"Hellhound on My Trail\" is a remarkable achievement in the blues. Over the years the song has been covered by such artists as Fleetwood Mac, Cassandra Wilson, and others."},
{"title": "Sex Kittens Go to College (1960)", "date": "Saturday, February 26, 2022", "text": "(This blog post is part of the 4th Annual So Bad It's Good Blogathon hosted by Taking Up Room)The term psychotronic refers to movies made on low budgets, often in the science fiction, fantasy, or horror genres, that were ridiculed by critics. There is perhaps no movie more \"psychotronic\" than Sex Kittens Go to College (1960). The comedy anticipated AIP's \"Beach Party\" movies in combining a college setting with touches of science fiction (and nearly everything else), all made on a shoe-string budget. Quite naturally, critics hated it. Also quite naturally, it has become a cult film. Sex Kittens Go to College stars Mamie Van Doren as Dr. Mathilda West, a super-genius who holds thirteen different degrees and speaks 18 languages. She also happens to be a buxom blonde who drives the male staff and students at Collins College to distraction (no surprise there given she is played by Mamie Van Doren). In addition to a super-intelligent beauty, Sex Kittens Go to College also involves a robot, gangsters, a chimp, and the usual teen hi-jinks.Sex Kittens Go to College originated with producer, director, and screenwriter Albert Zugsmith. Albert Zugsmith began his career as a journalist, publicist, newspaper broker, and  attorney. Among other things, he represented Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in their unsuccessful lawsuit against National Periodical Publications for the rights to Superman. He went from being a broker for newspapers, radio stations, and television stations to producing motion pictures. He started out with such low budget movies for RKO as Captive Women (1952) and Sword of Venus (1953) before producing such films as Raw Edge (1956), Star in the Dust (1956), and Touch of Evil (1958) for Universal. Albert Zugsmith moved from Universal to MGM. His first film for MGM was High School Confidential! (1958), starring Russ Tamblyn and Mamie Van Doren. Mr. Zugsmith had met Miss Van Doren at the Universal commissary. He cast her in the Western Star in the Dust despite objections from Universal executives. Following Star in the Dust and High School Confidential!, Mr. Zugsmith and Miss Van Doren would make five more films together. Initially Albert Zugsmith did not direct the films he produced, but all of that changed with College Confidential (1960). He also directed Sex Kittens Go to College (1960), which was filmed before College Confidential, but was released after it. Both films starred Mamie Van Doren.Albert Zugsmith would have some problems with MGM regarding the title of Sex Kittens Go to College. It went through such titles as Sexpot Goes to College, Sexpot Versus Teacher, and Teacher Was a Sexpot. MGM objected to the word \"sexpot\" as being too salacious. Mr. Zugsmith and MGM then settled on the title Sex Kittens Go To College as if the term \"sex kitten\" was somehow less provocative than \"sexpot.\" When released to television it would undergo another title change, being renamed the much less provocative Beauty and the Robot.Sex Kittens Go to College was filmed from November to December 1959. Despite this, it was released in October 1960, only two months after College Confidential. To put it lightly, the film was less than well received by critics. Despite the critics' opinions, Sex Kittens Go to College did relatively well at the box office for a low budget film.Mamie Van Doren was hardly the only big name to star in Sex Kittens Go to College. Martin Milner, who had appeared in such films as Pete Kelly's Blues (1955) and Sweet Smell of Success (1957) and would start his run as Tod Stiles on the TV show Route 66 not long before the movie was released, played Mamie Van Doren's love interest, George Barton. Jackie Coogan played gangster Wildcat MacPherson, while John Carradine played Professor Watts and Louis Nye played Dr. Zorch. Tuesday Weld played college student Jody; she was appearing as Thalia Menniger on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis even as Sex Kittens Go to College was filming. The movie also featured Conway Twitty, Vampira, and, in minor roles, Charlie Chaplin Jr. and Harold Lloyd Jr.  Conway Twitty also performed the movie's title song, \"Sexpot Goes to College.\" Although today firmly identified with country music, at the time Conway Twitter was counted as a rock 'n' roller.As to Thinko, the robot who played a major role in the plot, he was not a mere prop. In reality Thinko was Elecktro, a robot built by  Westinghouse Electric Corporation between 1937 and 1938. In 1939 he was exhibited at the New York World's Fair. In the Fifties Elektro toured the United States, promoting Westinghouse. From the late Fifties into the early Sixties, he was displayed at Pacific Ocean Park in Venice, California. He is currently owned by the Mansfield Memorial Museum in Mansfield, Ohio.Perhaps because of the low budget, it sometimes seems as if they simply made Sex Kittens Go to College up as they went along. The film is certainly over the top. After all, it combines a plot lifted from Ball of Fire (1941) with a robot, a bongo playing chimpanzee, gangsters, college politics, and college hi-jinks. It should be no surprise that in many ways Sex Kittens Go to College is a bad movie. Some might even say that it is a very bad movie. Despite, this somehow it all works. Sex Kittens Go to College is so outrageous, so blatant in its excesses, that it can't help but be entertaining. Indeed, the cast, from Mamie Van Doren to Martin Milner, all seem to be having fun in the movie. There is perhaps a good reason that while critics hated Sex Kittens Go to College, it went onto become a cult film anyway."},

She was fantastic as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner, the psychiatrist who develops psionic abilities in Star Trek's second pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before.\"In the humorous Bonanza episode \"A Dollar's Worth of Trouble\" she excelled as a blonde who causes trouble for Hoss. In the Centennial she did well as Lise Bockweiss, a Bavarian immigrant. Sally Kellerman was a versatile actress who could perform both comedy and drama equally well."},

As most classic film fans know, Jack Palance was the child of Ukrainian immigrants. His birth name was Volodymyr Palahniuk. Jack Palance was very proud of his Ukrainian heritage. Along with character actor Mike Mazuarki (who was also Ukrainian American), and others, he attended the dedication of the Taras Shevchenko Monument in Washington, D.C. on July 3 1964. It was there that he read an English translation of Taras Shevchenko's poem \"I Care Not If It's In Ukraine.\" Below is Jack Palance's reading of the poem, which never more felt more relevant in my lifetime than now."},
{"title": "All Lies End in Murder (1997)", "date": "Tuesday, February 22, 2022", "text": "Vanessa Marquez in All LiesEnd in MurderThis past January 19 it was 25 years since the premiere of the television movie All Lies End in Murder. It first aired on The ABC Sunday Night Movie on January 19 1997. All Lies End in Murder involved some notable talent both behind and in front of the camera. For myself it is notable as the only TV movie in which  my dear friend Vanessa Marquez appeared during her run as Nurse Wendy Goldman on the TV show ER.In All Lies End in Murder, following the murder of a police officer (Markie Valesquez, played by Rene L. Moreno), a police officer's wife Meredith Scialo (Kim Delaney) comes to suspect that her husband (Danny Scialo, played by Jamey Sheridan) is a corrupt cop. The movie follows her as she seeks evidence to confirm her suspicions. The teleplay for All Lies End in Murder was written by someone with a notable surname. Lynn Mamet is the sister of David Mamet, the playwright and screenwriter behind such works as the play Glengarry Glen Ross and the movie House of the Games (1987). Lynn Mamet had begun her career writing under her married name, Lynn Weisberg, but changed to her birth  name after a studio learned she was David Mamet's sister. It was directed by Andy Wolk, who had worked in the New York City theatre before moving into television and directing TV movies and episodes of such shows as Tales from the Crypt and N.Y.P.D. Blue. Lynn Mamet would later go onto work on the TV show Law & Order, while Andy Wolk would go onto work on such shows as The Practice and Criminal Minds.Here it must be stressed that All Lies End in Murder was not based on a true story. While the phrase \"based on a true story\" would become synonymous with TV movies, TV movies based on true stories really did not begin to take off until the mid to late Eighties. TV movies based on true stories peaked in popularity around 1992. By the mid-Nineties they had declined sharply in popularity, forcing the networks to seek out TV movies with more original storylines. All Lies End in Murder is one of those movies. At the time that All Lies End in Murder aired, Kim Delaney was still appearing as Detective Diane Russell on N.Y.P.D. Blue. Jamey Sheridan had played Dr. John Sutton on the TV show Chicago Hope. He would later play Captain James Deakins on Law & Order: Criminal Intent. Kevin Kilner played Rich Bernardi in All Lies End in Murder. He had previously appeared in the feature film Twenty Bucks (1993) and starred on the short-lived sitcom Almost Perfect. Meredith Scialo's fellow police wives were played by Any Pietz, who was on Caroline in the City at the time, and Robin Bartlett, who was appearing on Mad About You. While her name appears in the opening credits, Vanessa Marquez actually plays a very small role in All Lies End in Murder. She plays murdered police officer Markie Valesquez's widow Yvonne Valesquez. Vanessa is little more than window dressing in the film, appearing only in a few scenes and getting only a few lines. That having been said, what time she is on screen she does make an impression. She does a very good job of playing the grieving, young widow of a police officer.Over all, All Lies End in Murder is superior to most TV movies of the time. It unfolds much more realistically than many of the TV movies allegedly \"based on true stories.\" The plot is also filled with suspense, making All Lies End in Murder a fine thriller. Unlike many TV movies of the Nineties, the performances are naturalistic and not overwrought. Ultimately, All Lies End in Murder has only one major flaw. Late in the movie's plot an incident occurs that nearly breaks suspension of disbelief in the film. The incident itself is realistic enough, but consequences from that incident that one would expect in real life never occur. I can only figure that perhaps Lynn Mamet did not have the adequate time to deal with the incident (TV movies in the Nineties only ran a little over 90 minutes after commercials).Sadly, All Lies End in Murder is not widely available. It has never had an official release on DVD, nor is it on any streaming services. It can be found on the grey market. On YouTube there is a version dubbed into French under the French title La vérité à double tranchant (literally, \"Double Edged Truth\"). I very seriously doubt very many people remember All Lies End in Murder, which is a shame. It is a superior TV movie that stood out from its contemporaries in that it featured a fairly realistic plot and performances that were not overwrought. It definitely deserves the DVD release that many lesser TV movies have gotten."},
{"title": "Canada Lee: Musician, Athlete, and Actor", "date": "Monday, February 21, 2022", "text": "When people think of classic Black actors, such names as Paul Robeson, Dorothy  Dandridge, and Sidney Poitier may come to mind. There are only a very few who might think of Canada Lee. This is a shame, as he was an extremely talented and versatile actor.Canada Lee was born Leonard Lionel Cornelius Canegata on Mach 3 1907 in New York City. He grew up in Harlem. He was very young when he proved to have an aptitude for music. He started studying violin and piano with J. Rosamond Johnson at the Music School Settlement for Colored People when he was only seven years old. He was only eleven when he made his concert debut. He left home when he was 14 in 1921, going to Saratoga Springs, New York. It was there that he became a jockey. He returned to Harlem in 1923 (according to Mr. Lee it was because he gained too much weight to be a jockey). He considered taking up music again, but a friend suggested that he try boxing. It was through boxing that he received his stage name. He was billed as Canatega Lee at an amateur boxing match, but announcer Joe Humphries announced him as \"Canada Lee.\" Canada Lee liked the name and decided to keep it. He proved to be a formidable amateur boxer, winning 90 out of 100 bouts. He also won the amateur  lightweight title. He went professional in 1926. Records for boxing were not very well kept in the Twenties and Thirties, but Mr. Lee's obituary in The New York Times reported he won 200 bouts and lost 25. He ended his boxing career after a blow from Andy Divodi at Madison Square Garden on December 12 1929 detached the retina of his right eye. While Canada Lee won the 10-round match, he lost his sight in his right eye. He then chose to stop boxing.Canada Lee was still boxing when he formed a dance band. Initially playing at smaller clubs, Canada Lee's fortunes would change because of his old friend Ed Sullivan. Ed Sullivan had been a sports writer, but had launched an entertainment column in 1932. Mr. Sullivan plugged Canada Lee's band in his new column and the band began playing bigger venues. Eventually Canada Lee opened his own club, The Jitterbug. Sadly, it remained open only for six months in 1934.Canada Lee's career more or less came about by accident. In need of a job, he went to visit an old friend who was a counsellor for the employment bureau at the Harlem YMCA. He wandered about the YMCA for a while before entering a small auditorium where auditions were taking place.  He took a seat and watched the auditions. It was after a while that the director, Frank Wilson, beckoned Canada Lee to the stage, thinking he was there to audition. It was actor and playwright Augustus Smith who recognized him as the boxer Canada Lee. Frank Wilson then persuaded Mr. Lee to read for a part. Canada Lee got the part,that of Nathan in Brother Mose. His acting career had officially begun.Canada Lee would prove to have a successful career on stage. In 1934 he replaced Rex Ingram in a revival of Stevedore that played on Broadway and later went on tour to such cities as Chicago and Detroit. He played Banquo in Orson Welles's production of Macbeth. Mr. Lee would go onto appear in such productions as Haiti, Mamba's Daughters, Native Son, The Tempest, and Anna Lucasta.While Canada Lee was enormously successful on stage, he would make only a few movies. He made his film debut in 1939 in Keep Punching, playing the trainer for boxer Henry Jackson (Henry Armstrong). It was in 1944 that he appeared in one of his most significant film roles, playing Joe Spencer in Lifeboat. Canada Lee played boxing trainer Ben Chaplin in the film noir Body and Soul (1947), Naval officer Lt. Thompson in Lost Boundaries (1949), and  Black minister Stephen Kumalo (Canada Lee) in Cry, the Beloved Country (1951). Sadly, Cry, the Beloved Country would be Canada Lee's final role.  He died on May 9 1952 at the age of 45. At the time it was reported that the cause was a heart attack, but his widow later revealed that he had uraemia and he had actually died of kidney disease. In addition to being a talented actor, Canada Lee was also a remarkable man. In 1940 he met a young Jewish runaway named H. Jack Geiger backstage at Native Son. With the consent of young Geiger's parents, Mr. Lee too him in and young H. Jack Geiger stayed with him for a year. It was with a loan from Canada Lee that he was able to enroll at the University of Wisconsin in 1941. H. Jack Geiger not only became a well-known, respected physician, but an activist for civil rights. Among other things, he would become one of the founders of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Human Rights.When Canada Lee was touring the New York City boroughs with Native Son in 1941, he bought tickets to the show for fifty underprivileged boys from the Harlem YMCA. During World War II he promoted the buying of war bonds, and also spoke out against segregation in the United States military. He would late speak out against apartheid in South Africa.Sadly, Canada Lee would fall victim to the Hollywood blacklist, which is why he did not appear in more movies. According to Canada Lee's widow, Frances Lee, like other Black celebrities Mr. Lee was approached to denounce fellow actor and activist Paul Robeson as a Communist. According to Mrs. Lee, Canada Lee refused to do so. While some accounts claim that Canada Lee did denounce Paul Robeson, this seems highly unlikely. If he had, it would seem that he would no longer have been blacklisted. For that matter, Paul Robeson and Canada Lee remained friends until Mr. Lee's death. It would seem then that, despite the fact that he would not longer be blacklisted, Canada Lee refused to betray one of his friends.In some ways Canada Lee seems like a superhero. He was a musician. He was a jockey. He was a boxer. He was an actor. And while his careers as a musician, jockey, and boxer may have been cut short, he proved to be very successful as an actor. While he would only have a few movies to his credit, he is impressive in all of them. Once one has seen Canada Lee in a film, one can never forget him. It makes it all the sadder that he was blacklisted and died so young."},

{"title": "Leave the Hollywood Sign Alone", "date": "Tuesday, February 15, 2022", "text": "The Hollywood Sign in 1935Following the Los Angeles Rams' victory in the Super Bowl Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that a temporary installation reading \"Rams' House\" would be placed over the Hollywood Sign starting Monday and would remain in place until Wednesday in partnership with the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, the Hollywood Sign Trust, and the Los Angles Rams. As of yet, the installation has yet to be completed. To say I am upset would be putting it mildly.Now I know some people might think that this is due to the fact that I have hated the Rams ever since they left St. Louis, but that actually has nothing to do with it. I love the Los Angeles Dodgers, but if they won the World Series I would not want a temporary installation placed over the sign to celebrate that victory. Instead, for me it comes down to two things for me. The first is that the Hollywood Sign is important to me on a personal level. After all, it is where my dearest friend Vanessa's ashes were scattered. Any time I see the Hollywood sign, I cannot help but think of her and her love of classic film and Hollywood. The second and more important reason can be summed up by what the Hollywood Sign Trust says on the official website, \"The Hollywood Sign is more than just nine white letters spelling out a city's name. It’s one of the world's most famous monuments and a universal metaphor for ambition, success, glamour...for this dazzling place, industry and dream we call H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D.\"  For classic film fans, the Hollywood Sign is even more important than most people. For us it is a symbol of the films we love and the Los Angeles neighbourhood where those films originated. Indeed, the Hollywood Sign is one of those things people around the world want to see when they visit Los Angeles. I suspect many of those people, visiting Hollywood for the first time, would be very disappointed to see an installation altering the sign to read \"Ram's House.\" I have seen the Sign up close and I know I would be disappointed. Now I know the Sign originally read \"Hollywoodland\" and was constructed in 1923 to promote  a housing development in the Hollywood Hills. I know it remained that way until 1949, when it was shortened to \"Hollywood.\" I know in 1987 Fox Broadcasting paid to have the sign altered to read \"Fox\" as promotion for their new network. And it has been altered unofficially many times over (such as the notorious \"Hollyweed\" in 1976). Given how iconic the sign and close to many people's hearts the sign has become, my thought is that it should never be altered, even temporarily. Tourists want to see the \"Hollywood Sign,\" not the \"Fox Sign\" or the \"Rams' House Sign.\" If someone is only in Los Angeles for a few days and one of these temporary installations is up, then effectively their experience of the sign has been spoiled. In 2019 I was in Hollywood for only three days. I would have been  very disappointed and even hurt had the Sign read something other than \"Hollywood\" while I was there. I believe that the Hollywood Sign ceased to belong to the neighbourhood of Hollywood or even the City of Los Angeles long ago. It has become the property of anyone who loves film and loves the place where films are made. To place any kind of an installation over the name \"Holywood\" is to disappoint any film lover who wants to see the Sign on the days of that installation. The way I see, if the Hollywood Sign Trust and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce wanted to celebrate the Rams' victory, they could have simply illuminated the sign in royal blue and gold, much the way New York City illuminates the Empire State Building or St. Louis illuminates the Arch for special occasions. That way Los Angelinos can celebrate and those who love the Sign can rest assured that it reads \"Hollywood.\""},

{"title": "The TV Series Julia", "date": "Saturday, February 12, 2022", "text": "It was on September 17 1968 that the sitcom Julia, starring  Diahann Carroll, debuted. The show centred on Julia Baker, the widow whose husband had died in Vietnam, and her young son Corey (Marc Copage). Julia worked as a registered nurse for Dr. Morton Chegley (Lloyd Nolan), a physician for an aerospace company. For the first two seasons Hannah Yarby (Lurene Tuttle) was Dr. Chegley's clinic manager. Other regulars included neighbour boy Earl J. Waggedorn (Michael Link) and his mother Marie Waggedorn (Betty Beaird),  Julia was historic as the first sitcom to star an African American since Amos 'n' Andy and Beulah in the Fifties. It was also the first sitcom to feature an African American woman as a professional. Beulah on the show of the same name had been a domestic.Julia was created by Hal Kanter, who already had an extensive career at the time. He had written the screenplays for such films as Road to Bali (1952), Casanova's Big Night (1954), and Move Over, Darling (1963), among others. He had also worked on the TV series The Ed Wynn Show and The George Gobel Show. Julia was not the first show he had created. Mr. Kanter also created the sitcom Valentine's Day, which was historic in featuring the first East Asian American in a supporting role on an American sitcom (Jack Soo as Rocky Sin). Hal Kanter's inspiration for Julia emerged from a luncheon honouring NAACP Executive Director Roy Wilkins. He was greatly impressed by what he described as Mr. Wilkins's \"calm, objective appraisal of what was happening in America.\" Hal Kanter then pondered what he could do himself with regards to race relations, and the result was the script for the pilot of what was then called Mama's Man, which was later changed to Julia. Hal Kanter's agent was impressed with the script and pitched it to NBC. NBC would buy Julia as a series.Hal Kanter auditioned several actresses for the role of Julia, but upon noticing Diahann Carroll decided that she must be Julia. Miss Carroll already had a highly successful career. She was the first Black woman to win a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in No Strings. She had already appeared in such movies as Paris Blues (1961) and Hurry Sundown (1967). Miss Carroll was initially reticent to do the series, as she did not think it would work. It was David Tebet, NBC's  vice president for talent relations, who convinced her to sign on to the series.Despite Hal Kanter's well intentions, Julia would become the source of controversy well before it even debuted. In April 1968, a full five months before the show's debut, Robert Lewis Shayon wrote in The Saturday Review that Julia was \"...a far, far cry from the bitter realities of Negro life in the urban ghetto.\" Not only would criticism of Julia continue after the show debuted, but throughout its three year run. In Time magazine it was remarked that Julia \"...would not recognize a ghetto if she stumbled into it, and she is, in every respect save colour, a figure in a white milieu.\" Much of the criticism of Julia centred on the fact that the show lacked a Black male figure, the lead character being a widow. Other critics claimed that the show did not recognize the racism faced by African American every day.  Much of the criticism also centred on the fact that Julia belonged to the middle class and lived in an impossibly nice apartment. Many felt that the life Julia led on the show was far removed from the reality of the lives led by many African Americans. Similar criticisms would be directed at The Cosby Show in the Eighties, which portrayed an upper middle class Black family.As the star of the show, much of the criticism of Julia was directed at Diahann Carroll herself. To her credit, Miss Carroll fought for changes on the show behind the scenes. She was able to win some battles, while she lost others. Miss Carroll objected to a scene in which her character said her first experience of racism was at her high school prom, knowing as a Black woman that African Americans experience bigotry much, much earlier, and she even left the set in protest the day the scene was to be shot. While she ultimately won that battle, she was not able to convince the producers to let her wear an Afro. The stress from the controversy over Julia would ultimately lead Diahann Carroll to be hospitalized twice during the show's run.Seen today, much of the criticism towards Julia during its original run must be considered valid. Julia lived in a lavish apartment that a nurse, even one working at an aerospace company could not possibly afford. Similarly, her wardrobe would have been out of reach not only of many Black women, but of nurses living a middle class lifestyle as well. Her friends (Marie, Dr. Chegley, and Hannah) were all white, as were her neighbours in her apartment building. Aside from Julia and Corey, the only other Black characters to appear on the show were Julia's two boyfriends during the run of the show (Fred Williamson as Steven Bruce and Paul Winfield as Paul Cameron).  Julia's apartment was devoid of anything related to Black culture, and could easily have belonged to any white character of the era. For all the criticism Julia received, it did receive support from Ebony and Jet, although both magazines admitted it was a slight, sugary confection. And for all the criticism that Julia did not address the prejudice faced by African Americans every day, some episodes of the show did tackle the subject. In the episode \"Romeo and Julia,\" there are awkward moments when Julia drops Corey off at a white classmate's birthday party and the mother did not realize Corey was black. In the episode \"Paint Your Waggedorn,\" a neighbour accuses Corey and Earl of crayon drawings made in the hallway and even complains that \" \"turning into a ghetto\" because of \"those people.\" This leads Julia to explain prejudice to Corey. While it is true Julia did not encounter some of the more severe instances of prejudice experienced by not only African Americans, but other minorities, it was not entirely absent from the show.While many of the other criticisms of Julia are valid, today they can easily explained by the shape of American television at the time. Portrayals of poverty in American sitcoms were virtually unknown in the Sixties. Even when a sitcom did not portray wealthy or upper middle class characters (such as the Stephens on Bewitched or Bill Davis on Family Affair) sitcoms characters were portrayed as living more lavishly than they would have in real life. On That Girl Ann Marie (Marlo Thomas) was a struggling actress who realistically have lived below the poverty line, but she lived in a fancy apartment and had a very posh wardrobe. The absence of a father on Julia can also be viewed through the lens of television in 1968. In the Sixties, the single parent was something of a sitcom standard. Andy Taylor on The Andy Griffith Show, Steven Douglas on My Three Sons, Doris Martin on The Doris Day Show, and Carolyn Muir on The Ghost & Mrs. Muir, among others, all raised children without a spouse. In portraying Julia as a widow, Julia was once again conforming to sitcom tropes of the 1960s.It must also be pointed out that in the Sixties it was exceedingly rare for American sitcoms to address any sort of social or political issues. Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. centred on the Marine of the title and took place on a military base, yet the Vietnam War was not mentioned during the entire run of the show. The Andy Griffith Show took place in small Southern town, but there were no Black regulars (although Blacks did appear on the show) and it never dealt with racial issues (the Civil Rights Movement was never addressed at all). In the Sixties American sitcoms were devoted to escapism, and any political or social issues were avoided for the most part. That Julia's husband is acknowledged to have died when his helicopter was shot down in Vietnam was then a major break from other sitcoms of the era.  And while Julia may have been timid in its approach to racism, the fact that it acknowledged its existence at all was also a major break from other sitcoms of the era.While audiences may have well been ready for a realistic portrayal of African Americans living in the ghetto in 1968, it would seem that most television producers and the broadcast networks were not. It would not be until All in the Family debuted in 1971 that a sitcom would actually address political and social issues, and even then CBS felt it had to include a warning before its first several episodes. Many of the criticisms of Julia at the time are valid, but at the same time one has to wonder if the show would have even made it to the air if Julia and Corey had been living in a ghetto and had experienced more extreme forms of prejudice than they had. In 1968 both the networks and TV producers were very cautious with regards to programming. While I am not certain that the theory of the least offensive program was as dominant in the late Sixties as some would lead one to believe, given the emphasis on escapism during the Sixties, network executives and television producers tended to avoid anything that might be too controversial.Regardless of the controversy, Julia proved to be a popular show. In its first season it ranked no. 7 for the year in the Nielsen ratings. For its second season, facing new competition in the form of the ABC Movie of the Week (which ranked no. 22 for the year),  it came in at a still respectable no. 28 for the year. In its third season NBC moved Julia to an earlier time slot (although it remained on Tuesday night) opposite The Mod Squad. It dropped out of the top thirty for the year, but still it did well enough to warrant renewal. Sadly, the stress over the constant criticism of Julia, some of which included personal attacks on herself, led Diahann Carroll to ask to be released from her contract in 1970. Julia then ended its run after three seasons on the air. Its last original episode aired on March 31 1971.While today Julia might seem to an unrealistic, if innocuous, sitcom, it can be considered groundbreaking given the shape of television in the Sixties. As mentioned earlier, it was the first sitcom with an African American since Amos 'n'  Andy and Beulah (the latter of which had gone off the air 15 years before Julia debuted). What is more, while Amos 'n' Andy featured gross, racist stereotypes, Julia and the other Black characters on the show were not caricatures. While this might not seem particularly remarkable now, one must consider the fact that for most of the Sixties regular, African American characters were virtually unknown on American sitcoms. In fact, the only one that comes to mind is Sgt. James \"Kinch\" Kinoche (played by the great Ivan Dixon) on Hogan's Heroes.As a nurse, Julia Baker was also the female African American character who was a professional on American television. Earlier female Black characters (such as Beulah) were domestics. As mentioned earlier, in having Julia's husband die in Vietnam the show broke with the sitcom tradition of avoiding any important issues. Julia certainly did have its flaws. Belonging to the middle class, living in a nice apartment, and wearing posh clothing, Julia Baker had little in common with many African Americans in the late Sixties. The show failed to address more extreme types of prejudice even as the Civil Rights Movement was under way.The show lacked a black male lead, something which led to much of the criticism of the show. Still, the fact remains that Julia proved that a show with a Black lead could be successful. In this way Julia led to the many, more realistic sitcoms with Black characters in the Seventies. Controversial in its day and in some ways not very revolutionary, Julia id change American television."},

I have always had two problems with the programming block. The lesser of the two is that it pre-empts all of TCM's usual programming. That means no Noir Alley during the month, no Silent Sunday Nights, no TCM Underground. Now Summer Under the Stars also pre-empts all of TCM's usual programming, but I love it because it means Turner Classic Movies will air many, many films I love. That brings me to my other reason for not enjoying 31 Days of Oscar. It is often the case that TCM shows fewer of my favourite movies than any time of year. Worse yet, when they do show one of my favourite movies, it is often at an awkward time (like 6:00 AM).Fortunately this year is a bit better than most years, with TCM showing several of my favourite movies and, what is more, showing them at good times for viewing. Indeed, they are even showing some of my favourite films in primetime! Below are my picks for this year's 31 Days of Oscar.

{"title": "Sounder (1972)", "date": "Thursday, February 10, 2022", "text": "It was last year that the classic film Sounder (1972) was finally added to the National Film Registry. Many people, myself included, were shocked that it had not been added years ago. Sounder is a classic film that received critical acclaim upon its release and is still acclaimed now. It was nominated for four Academy Awards and was nominated for yet other awards. It won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress for Cicely Tyson and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress for Miss Tyson as well. Released at the height of the Blaxpoitation cycle, Sounder has come to be regarded as a major achievement in Black Cinema. The movie celebrates its 50th anniversary on September 24 of this year.Sounder was based on the young adult novel of the same name by William H. Armstrong. Sounder centred on an African American boy, his sharecropper family, and their dog. Sounder. In the novel , Sounder is the only character whose name is given. The boy is simply called \"the boy,\" the father \"the father,\" and so on. The time period is also kept vague. References to \"mule-drawn wagons\" make it clear Sounder is set before automobiles became common. The fact that the family use a chunk stove also make it clear that the novel is set sometime before electricity was commonplace. References to \"chain gangs\" make it clear it was set before 1955, when the practice was abolished. As to the place, references to Bartlow County and Gilmer County make it clear it is set in Georgia.Sounder was critically acclaimed upon its publication in 1969, and it won the Newbery Medal in 1970. At the time it should have come as no surprise that Robert B. Radnitz, a producer known for such family films as A Dog of Flanders (1960), Misty (1961), and My Side of the Mountain (1969), decided to adapt the novel Sounder as a movie. Robert B. Radnitz called director Martin Ritt and sent him a copy of the novel. While Martin Ritt had seen some success with such movies as Hud (1963) and The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965), his last two films, The Great White Hope (1970) and The Molly Maguires (1970) had failed at the box office. Martin Ritt did not want to make another big motion picture, so he agreed to direct Sounder for an eighty percent cut because Robert B. Radnitz could not afford to pay him anything. To write the screenplay African American playwright Lonne Elder III was contacted. He initially turned it down, but producer Robert B. Radnitz and director Martin Ritt convinced him to work on the film. Mr. Elder wanted to keep the film historically accurate. The film would see some changes from the novel. While the novel appears to be set in Georgia, the film is set in Louisiana, where it was shot on location (St. Helena Parish and East Feliciana Parish, to be exact). Here it must be pointed out the movie was set to film in Macon, Georgia, but reportedly did not do so due to racial tensions. While the time of the novel is vague as to when it set, the film is set in the year 1933. While human characters are unnamed in the novel, in the movie they are given names (for example, the family of sharecroppers are the Morgans). The film also centres more on the Morgan family and  less on the dog Sounder than the novel had. As mentioned earlier, Sounder was shot on location in Louisiana. Both director Martin Ritt and cinematographer John A. Alonzo elected to film Sounder as realistically as possible. They took inspiration from photographers Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange, who both documented sharecroppers and farmers during the Great Depression. As hard it might be to believe, initially Cicely Tyson was not cast as the mother, Rebecca Morgan. Initially she was cast as the schoolteacher. Martin Ritt offered the role to another actress, who turned it down. Cicely Tyson then approached Mr. Ritt about playing the role of the mother. Martin Ritt was reluctant to cast Cicely Tyson in the role, thinking she was \"too beautiful.\" Fortunately, he eventually cast her in the role. Paul Winfield, who had guest starred on several television shows and appeared in the films The Lost Man (1969) and R.P.M. (1970), was cast in the role of the father, Nathan Lee Morgan. Many of the non-supporting roles were played by local people from around St. Helena Parish and East Feliciana Parish. In fact, the judge and the preacher in the film were a judge and a preacher in reality (Judge William Thomas Bennett and Reverend Thomas N. Phillips).As mentioned earlier, Sounder would be nominated for several awards. It was the first film in which two Black actors (Paul Winfield for the Best Actor award and Cicely Tyson for the Best Actress award) were nominated for Oscars. This would not happen again until  What's Love Got to Do with It (1993), for which both Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett were nominated for Oscars.A sequel, Part 2, Sounder was released in 1976. While Robert B. Radnitz produced the film and Lonne Elder III wrote the screenplay, Martin Ritt did not return as the film's director. Of the original cast, only Taj Mahal as Ike and Ted Airhart as Mr. Perkins returned. The film did not repeat the success of Sounder. Part 2, Sounder received poor reviews and did badly at the box office. In 2003 The Wonderful World of Disney aired a television adaptation of the novel Sounder. Kevin Hooks, who played David in the 1972 film, directed the movie, while Paul Winfield played the teacher in the film. Sounder was released on September 24 1972 to nearly universal critical acclaim. It also did well at the box office. Made for only $1.9 million, Sounder made $16.9 million. What is more, Sounder has maintained its reputation over the years. The film was included AFI's list AFi's 100 Years...100 Cheers. It also made the list of Filmsite's Greatest Tearjerkers and Movie Moments of All-Time. As mentioned earlier, it was added to the National Film Registry last year.Sounder has been one of my favourite movies since childhood. I grew up on a farm outside a small town, and I have always had plenty of Black friends. The movie largely appealed to me because it portrayed an African American family living in a rural area at a time when most Black characters in the media were portrayed as living in big cities. Despite being set in the 1930s and lacking much of the technology my friends and I grew up with (the average person did not own a TV set in 1933), the movie's milieu then seemed much more familiar to me than New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles. Even as a boy, I could identify with David Lee Morgan (Kevin Hooks), his love for his dog Sounder, and his love of reading. As I got older I also appreciated its fine writing, its excellent performances, and it historical accuracy. Indeed, while Sounder is suitable viewing for older children, it does not shy away from the brutal realities of racism in the era. Sounder isn't only a landmark achievement in Black Cinema, it is a landmark achievement in American cinema and cinema all over the world."},
{"title": "The Late Great Douglas Trumbull", "date": "Tuesday, February 8, 2022", "text": "Legendary special effects artist Douglas Trumbull died yesterday, February 7 2022, at the age of 79. The past two years he had cancer, a brain tumour, and a stroke. Mr. Trumbull had worked on such movies as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Silent Running (1972), and Blade Runner (1982).Douglas Trumbull was born on April 8 1942 in Los Angeles. His father was Don Trumbull, who had been a special effects artist on The Wizard of Oz (1939). Growing up he enjoyed building crystal radio sets. He was also a fan of science fiction movies and serials. Initially planned to become an architect. He worked at an electronics contracting firm while attending El Camino Junior College where he was studying technical illustration. He was eventually hired by Graphic Films to provide art for a spiralling galaxy for their New York Worlds Fair film \"To the Moon and Beyond.\" The film caught the attention of director Stanley Kubrick and author Arthur C. Clarke. Stanley Kubrick then hired both Douglas Trumbull and Graphic Films director Con Pederson to provide preliminary designs for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Stanley Kubrick decided to move production of 2001: A Space Odyssey to England and cancelled his contract with Graphic Films. In the interim Douglas Trumbull worked for a furniture company. Determined to work on the film, he asked Con Pederson for Stanley Kubrick's phone number and called the director. Douglas Trumbull's initial work on 2001: A Space Odyssey was designing the computer screen readouts on the monitors of the spaceship Discovery One. As he continued to work on the film, he received more and more responsibility.Following 2001 Douglas Trumbull created the opening and closing sequences for the movie Candy (1968). He provided special effects for the movies The Andromeda Strain (1971), Silent Running (1972, which he also directed), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), and Blade Runner (1982). He was also a visual effects consultant on the movie The Tree of Life (2011). His final visual effects credit was The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot (2018), on which he also served as an executive producer. He also provided special effects for the debut episode of the TV series The Starlost. He also served as an executive producer on the show.Douglas Trumbull also directed the films Silent Running (1972), Brainstorm (1983), and Luxor Live (1993). In 1974 Douglas Trumbull co-founded the research/visual effects house Future General Corp., which was based at Paramount. It was also that year that he founded Magicam, Inc. at Paramount. In 1994 Douglas Trumbull was Vice Chairman of Imax Corporation and President of its subsidiary Ridefilm for a time. Douglas Trumbull also animated the opening sequence for ABC's movie anthology ABC Movie of the Week. The sequence was designed by Harry Marks. He also created the Showscan process, which was introduced with his film Brainstorm.Douglas Trumbull brought movie special effects into the late 20th Century and his influence has been seen ever since. He was capable of creating effects that looked real, something that can be seen in both 2001 and Blade Runner. What is more, he could even do it on a low budget. Silent Running was made for only $1,350,000, but looked better than more expensive films. The opening sequence to The Tree of Life, portraying the creation of life, was simply mind boggling. If Douglas Trumbull was not the greatest special effects artists thus far, he certain numbered among the absolute greatest."},
{"title": "The 100th Birthday of Patrick Macnee", "date": "Sunday, February 6, 2022", "text": "I can still remember the first time I saw The Avengers. It was a rainy Sunday when I was about six years old. In those days we had a fairly tall television aerial, so we could pick up stations from both St. Louis and Kansas City at times. With nothing better to do, my brother and I turned on the TV in hopes of finding something to watch other than sports. It was then on one of the Kansas City stations that we saw a television show about a dapper Englishman in a bowler and a beautiful woman who could fight better than most men. With that episode I was hooked. My brother and I would tune in and watch The Avengers any time we could pick up that Kansas City television station on a Sunday afternoon. It was then at the age of six that I became a fan of The Avengers and the great Patrick Macnee.Given the large role he played in my childhood, it is hard for me to believe that it was 100 years ago today, on February 6 1922, that Patrick Macnee was born in Paddington, London. From that first episode of The Avengers I watched, John Steed would become one of my all time favourite characters and one of my earliest heroes, along with his partner Emma Peel (played by Diana Rigg). John Steed was the epitome of the English gentleman and, aside from my parents, aunts, and uncles, it was from him that I learned what a gentleman should be. He was brave, honourable, and loyal to a fault. He was gallant towards women, although he treated them as equals. Steed never talked down to Emma nor did he treat her as anything other than the competent woman she was. Even as I got older and saw The New Avengers and later episodes of the original series on The CBS Late Movie, John Steed remained one of my heroes.Of course, as a I got older I also realized that Patrick Macnee played more roles than John Steed. When I watched Battlestar Galactica in the late Seventies, I knew Mr. Macnee was the voice of the Imperious Leader of the Cylons. He would later play Count Iblis on the show. Of course, I would also see Patrick Macnee pop up in guest appearances on the many reruns I watched as  a child and a young adult. In the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode \"Arthur,\" he played the police sergeant investigating the title character. He was Dr. Watson to Roger Moore's Holmes in the TV movie Sherlock Holmes in New York. In the classic Christmas movie Scrooge (1951, also known as A Christmas Carol) he played a young Jacob Marley. I would later see him in such movies as The Howling (1981) and This is Spinal Tap (1984).Regardless of the role, regardless of the project, Patrick Macnee always gave a good performance. He was as good in the classic Les Girls (1957) as he was in the not so classic A View to a Kill (1985). What is more, Mr. Macnee was as good at drama as he was at comedy. He could play a Scotland Yard police sergeant in all seriousness, but at the same time play a mad scientist in a parody equally well. I have to suspect that, other than the fact that Patrick Macnee was the epitome of English gentlemen, the reason he was so good as John Steed is because he could play both comedy and drama well. Played largely tongue in cheek, The Avengers is a mixture of both. Patrick Macnee died on June 15 2007 at the age of 93. I won't deny that I cried that day. Patrick Macnee had played one of my childhood heroes. As I got older I realized that he was a great actor who played a variety of roles over the years. While there are many actors I admire, few have had the impact on me that Mr. Macnee did."},

No less than Fred Astaire called the sequence the greatest he had ever seen. What makes this sequence all the more remarkable is that it was filmed in one take. It wasn't even rehearsed.

{"title": "The Beatles: Get Back", "date": "Thursday, February 3, 2022", "text": "As a Beatles fan I had to watch The Beatles: Get Back, the documentary mini-series currently on Disney+. For those of you wondering exactly what The Beatles: Get Back is, it will take some explaining. It was in January 1969 that The Beatles gathered at  Twickenham Film Studios for a planned television documentary that would include a live performance. The Beatles rehearsed at Twickenham Film Studios for several days before moving to Apple Studios to record. It was on January 30 1969 that The Beatles performed their famous concert atop the rooftop of Apple Studios.  Ultimately, sixty hours of film footage was shot, as well as over 150 hours of audio recorded for the project then titled Get Back and later renamed Let It Be. Only about 80 minutes worth of footage would find its way into the 1970 documentary Let It Be. With the cooperation of the surviving Beatles (Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr) and the widows of John Lennon and George Harrison, as well as producer George Martin's son Giles Martin, director Peter Jackson then set about putting together The Beatles: Get Back using much of the footage that did not find its way into the documentary Let It Be.The resulting documentary series is fascinating in that it puts to rest some myths surrounding the Get Back sessions. For years Beatles fans and others have believed that by the time of the Get Back sessions, The Beatles were at each others' throats and not all getting along well. The Beatles: Get Back paints a very different picture. While The Beatles do have their disagreements (indeed, George Harrison even quits the band for several days), The Beatles: Get Back shows that The Beatles were still four friends with great affection for each other. The documentary series also puts to rest the idea that Yoko Ono broke up The Beatles. In The Beatles: Get Back, Yoko Ono's presence at Twickenham Film Studios and Apple Studios is totally unobtrusive. She passes the time reading the newspaper, knitting, and doing crossword puzzles, or talking with the other Beatle wives. What is more, the other Beatles seem to genuinely like Yoko. In many ways her presence in the studio is much like Linda McCartney's. Both wives seemed content to stay out of The Beatles' way and let them do their thing.Beyond dispelling various myths about The Beatles, The Beatles: Get Back gives fans a chance to see some of the band's classic songs in their earliest stages. These are not only the songs that would wind up on the album Let It Be, but even songs that would wind up on Abbey Road (or in the case of \"Old Brown Shoe,\" the B-side of a single) or on The Beatles' later solo projects. Among the songs we get to see evolve in the documentary series are \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer,\" \"Golden Slumbers,\" \"Carry That Weight,\" \"Mean Mr. Mustard,\" \"Octopus's Garden,\" and yet others. We also get to see The Beatles perform a wide variety of classic songs, from \"What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For?\" to \"Milk Cow Blues\" to \"Shake, Rattle and Roll.\" The soundtrack to The Beatles: Get Back makes it worth watching. Let's face it, where else is one going to get to see The Beatles perform \"A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody?\"If there is one drawback to The Beatles: Get Back, it could be the utter length of the series. Each of the three episodes clocks in at well over two hours, with Episode 2 clocking in at nearly three hours in length. While this would hardly be a hurdle for die-hard Beatles fans (it wasn't for me), I am worried some more casual fans might bail on the series before finishing it. My advice to more casual fans who might find the length of The Beatles: Get Back intimidating is to so simply watch it in smaller chunks. The documentary goes day by day, so it is easy to stop watching an episode and then take it back up at a later time.The Beatles: Get Back is an incredible achievement on Peter Jackson's part and it shows the last days of The Beatles in an entirely new light. For anyone who is a Beatles fan, anyone who is interested in the music of the Sixties, or anyone who is interested in Anglophonic pop culture, The Beatles: Get Back comes highly recommended."},
{"title": "The Late Great Monica Vitti", "date": "Wednesday, February 2, 2022", "text": "Monica Vitti, known as the Queen of Italian Cinema, died today, February 2 2022, at the age of 90. The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease. Monica Vitti was born Maria Luisa Ceciarelli in Rome on November 3 1931. As a teenager she appeared in amateur theatrical productions. She attended the National Academy of Dramatic Arts in Rome, from which she graduated in 1953. She toured Germany with an Italian acting troupe and her first appearance on stage in Rome was in a production of La Mandragola. Monica Vitti made her film debut in an uncredited role in Ridere! Ridere! Ridere! (1954). In the late Fifties she appeared in the films Una pelliccia di visone (1956) and Le dritte (1958). Her big break came with  Michelangelo Antonioni's  L'avventura (1960), in which played the somewhat detached protagonist searching for one of her friends. She made her television debut in the mini-series L'alfiere (1956). In the late Fifties she appeared on television in the TV movie Questi ragazzi, the TV movie Il tunnel, the TV series Mont-Oriol, and the TV movie Il borghese gentiluomo. In the Sixties Monica Vitti appeared in the movies La notte (1961), Les quatre vérités (1962), Dragées au poivre (1963), Château en Suède (1963), Alta infedeltà (1964), Il deserto rosso (1964), Il disco volante (1964), Le bambole (1965), Modesty Blaise (1966), Le fate (1966), Fai in fretta ad uccidermi... ho freddo!

On television she appeared in the TV movie Le notti bianche  and the TV series Les fables de La Fontaine. In the Seventies she appeared in the movies La supertestimone (1971), Noi donne siamo fatte così (1971), Gli ordini sono ordini (1972), La Tosca (1973), Teresa la ladra (1973), Polvere di stelle (1973), Le fantôme de la liberté (1974), A mezzanotte va la ronda del piacere (1975), Qui comincia l'avventura (1975), L'anatra all'arancia (1975), Mimì Bluette... fiore del mio giardino (1976), Basta che non si sappia in giro!..

On television she appeared in the TV movie Il cilindro.In the Eighties Monica Vitti appeared in the movies Camera d'albergo (1981), Il tango della gelosia (1981), Io so che tu sai che io so (1982), Scusa se è poco (1982), Flirt (1983), Francesca è mia (1986), and Scandalo segreto (1990). She appeared in the TV movie La fuggiDiva. Monica Vitti's last appearance was in the TV movie Ma tu mi vuoi bene?  in 1992. Monica Vitti was simply an incredible actress. She could convey the feelings of her characters without saying a thing. One did not need to know Italian or read subtitles to often know how her characters felt. What is more, she gave some amazing performances in her career. She was the distant protagonist in  L'avventura. She played the vivacious Valentina in La Notte. In Il  deserto rosso, she played Giuliana, the wife of an industrial manager trapped by the alienation she feels in her world. It was for the power of her performances that Monica Vitti was dubbed the Queen of Italian Cinema. There are very few who could ever match her."},

He also had a successful career as a mystery novelist, writing such books as Deadhead, Games Murderers Play, Cat Got Your Tongue?, Only Her Hairdresser Knew, Sleight of Deadly Hand, The Peabody Experience, and Stumped. Carleton Carpenter was a remarkable actor and singer. His duet with Debbie Reynolds of \"Aba Daba Honeymoon\" from Two Weeks with Love remains memorable. Indeed, their version of the song (which dates to the days of vaudeville) was released as a single and peaked at no. 3 on the Billboard singles chart. He also gave memorable turns in such films in such films as Three Little Words and Summer Stock. Although he will probably be best remembered for his work in musicals, Mr. Carpenter could do other sorts of roles as well. In the Perry Mason episode \"The Case of the Lover's Leap\" he played Perry's client, the scientist Peter Brent, who is falsely accused of murder. In The Rifleman episode \"The Coward\" he played George Collins, a young man with a passion for writing who is working as a cook on a cattle drive and is bullied by the cowboys. Carleton Carpenter was a talented actor who was as adept at drama as he was at comedy. He could play roles in everything from musicals to Westerns and do all of them well."},

He was wonderfully realized by Howard Hesseman, who brought his real life experience as a DJ to the character. I wasn't the only one who loved Johnny, as he seemed to be the most popular character on the show. Of course, Howard Heseman played other roles as well. He was teacher Charlie Moore on Head of the Class and he played Sam Royer in One Day at a Time. He also appeared in such movies as Shampoo (1975) and Heat (1986).  Sadly, Howard Hesseman died on January 29 2022 at the age of 81.

It was in 1978 that he began a four year run as Dr. Johnny Fever on WKRP in Cincinnati. He was twice nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Variety or Music Series for the role.

In 1986 he began a four year run as teacher Charlie Moore on Head of the Class. He guest starred on the shows 9 to 5; Love, Sidney; Murder, She Wrote; George Burns Comedy Week; and Faerie Tale Theatre.

He guest starred on the shows The Ray Bradbury Theatre; Burke's Law; The Outer Limits; Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place; The Practice; Tracy Takes On...; Family Law; The Pretender; and Touched by an Angel.

I think it is safe to say that Howard Hesseman will always be best remembered as Dr. Johnny Fever, the DJ who only really comes alive when he is on the air. As identified as he always with be with Johnny, Mr. Hesseman played many great roles throughout his career. He shined as struggling screenwriter Craig Plager on The Bob Newhart Show. He was also impressive as Charlie Moore, the unconventional teacher on Head of the Class. He played the rather dodgy lawyer Pinchus Zion in the movie Heat and did a very good job at it. Although Howard Hesseman played several hippies in his career (which include Johnny Fever, who had been a hippie), he also played a wide range of other roles, including doctors, lawyers, and even military officers. Howard Hesseman was a singular talent who had a particular gift for comedy and a gift for creating fully realized characters. If Dr. Johnny Fever is such a beloved character, it is because of the sheer talent of Howard Hesseman."},

Given that fact, it might seem odd that Turner Classic Movies is dedicating Monday nights during the month to movies about break-ups. It might not seem so odd when one considers that there are those who don't particularly appreciate St. Valentine's Day because they are single or they have broken up with their sweetheart, not to mention there are many out there who simply enjoy a good movie about the dissolution of a relationship. Regardless, TCM has a particularly fine line-up of movies centred on break-ups.The movies on  It's Not You It's Me--Breakup Classics are each devoted to a different category. There are Pre-Code Heartbreakers, such as The Divorcee (1930) starring Norma Shearer.  Knowing Me, Knowing You, to which  The Way We Were (1973) belongs. Teenage Tearjerkers, of which Splendour in the Grass (1961) is one, The best known of the movies in  Slow Burns, is the classic Casablanca (1942). And then there is Divorce Remorse, which includes The Awful Truth (1937). TCM is showing some truly great films for It's Not Me, It's You--Breakup Classics. If you have not seen The Divorcee, by all means you should. And while I do not consider Brief Encounter to be romantic the way many classic film buffs do, it is a very fine film. I also have to recommend Casablanca, which is one of my top five films of all time. February 28 may well be the best night of It's Not Me, It's You--Breakup Classics, featuring as it does The Awful Truth, Divorce American Style, and Adam's Rib.

He was 65 years old. Peter Robbins was born Louis Nanasi in Los Angeles on August 10 1956. He started acting when he was only 7 years old. He made his film debut in the film A Ticklish Affair in 1963. The following he made his television debut in an episode of Rawhide. He went on to guest star on the TV shows The Donna Reed Show, The Munsters, The Farmer's Daughter, and The Joey Bishop Show.Peter Robbins first voiced Charlie Brown in animated segments of the unreleased documentary A Boy Named Charlie Brown (not to be confused with the later feature film of the same name). After wards he voiced the character in the first Charlie Brown special A Charlie Brown Christmas. He continued to voice Charlie Brown until 1969, his final special being It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown. He also provided the voice of Charlie Brown in the first Charlie Brown feature film, A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969). He also played Alexander Bumstead in the short-lived sitcom Blondie.Peter Robbins also appeared in the movies Moment to Moment  (1966), And Now Miguel (1966), Good Times (1967), and The Boatniks (1970). He guest starred on the shows Love on a Rooftop, ABC Stage 67, The F.B.I., F Troop, Get Smart, and Bracken's World. His last appearance was in an episode of My Three Sons in 1972.While he had a successful career as a child actor, sadly Peter Robbins struggled with his mental health as an adult. He suffered from both bipolar disorder and paranoid schizophrenia. This led to occasional run-ins with the law. In 2019 he told KSWB in San Diego in an interview, “I would recommend to anybody that has bipolar disorder to take it seriously because your life can turn around in the span of a month, like it did to me.”When many people think of Charlie Brown , it is Peter Robbins's choice they hear in their head. And this is with good reason. Peter Robbins was prefect as the character. While others have voiced the character over the years, no one did it better."},
{"title": "Godspeed Don Wilson of The Ventures", "date": "Wednesday, January 26, 2022", "text": "Don Wilson, the rhythm guitarist who co-founded The Ventures died at age 88 on January 22 2022.Don Wilson was born in Tacoma, Washington on February 10 1933. When he was young he was a fan of country music-and-western music and big band music. He stated out playing the trombone, but switched to the guitar when he was the United States Army. He worked as a car salesman and a construction worker before he co-founded a band called The Versatones with lead guitarist Bob Bogle in the late Fifties. Finding that the name was already taken, the band was renamed The Ventures in 1959. The Ventures' first single, \"Cookies and Coke,\" was released in 1960, but did not chart. That same year their second single, \"Walk, Don't Run\" was released. It ultimately went to no. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album of the same title, peaked at no. 11 on the Billboard album chart. Throughout the Sixties The Ventures would have several single reach the Hot 100, and they would have another huge hit with their cover of the theme to the television show Hawaii Five-O, which went to no. 4 on the Hot 100. Their albums also did well, often peaking in the upper reaches of the Billboard album chart.With the advent of the Seventies, The Ventures' fortunes changed and neither their singles nor their albums were charting. It was with the eighties that the band experienced something of a resurgence, with punk and New Wave bands acknowledging their influence. While The Ventures experienced changes in membership over the years, Don Wilson remained with the group until he retired in 2015. As The Ventures' rhythm guitarist and the band's most constant member, Don Wilson was very important to the group's sound. He was one of the best rhythm guitarist in rock music, with a style that was direct and powerful and nunlike anyone else. It was largely because of Don Wilson's rhythm guitar that The Ventures became the most successful instrumental group of all time. In 1963 they had five albums at once on the Billboard album chart. The Ventures were certainly influential. They technically pre-dated surf rock and they did not consider themselves a surf rock band, but they had a huge impact on the subgenre nonetheless. They also had an impact on power pop, punk, and New Wave, as well as guitar groups in general. They pioneered both flanging and fuzz guitar. They ultimately had an impact on  bands as diverse as The Beach Boys and Kiss. In the end, Don Wilson was one of the most influential rock musicians of all time."},
{"title": "The Jokers (1967)", "date": "Friday, January 21, 2022", "text": "(This post is part of the Odd or Even Blogathon hosted by Reelweegiemidget Reviews and Taking Up Room)Heist movies (movies about the planning and execution of robberies) emerged in the Fifties with such films as The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and Armoured Car Robbery (1950). Most of the early heist films tended to be serious in tone, but by the Sixties many heist movies elected to follow the lead of the comedies The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Ladykillers (1955). Such heist films done with a comedic tone are known as \"caper movies.\" If there was Golden Age for caper movies, it was likely the Sixties. The decade saw the release of such caper movies as Topkapi (1964), How to Steal a Million (1966), Who's Minding the Mint (1967), and The Italian Job (1969). Among the many caper films released during the Sixties was The Jokers (1967). Although not as well remembered as some of the caper films of the era, there is every reason it should be.The Jokers centres on the brothers Michael (Michael Crawford) and David Tremayne (Oliver Reed). The two of them are dissatisfied with their lives and long for recognition, even though they don't want to work for it. The two of them then decide to commit a crime as a sort of \"grand gesture\" that will bring them fame. Realizing that one can't be charged with theft unless they mean to permanently deprive an owner of their property, Michael and David set their sights on robbing the British crown jewels and then returning them. The Jokers was directed by Michael Winner and based on a story by Michael Winner, with a screenplay by Ben Arbeid and Maurice Foster. In the mid-Sixties Winner was on a bit of a roll. His two movies before The Jokers were The System (1964) and You Must Be Joking! (1965). He would follow The Jokers up with I'll Never Forget What's'isname (1967). He would go onto such films as Death Wish (1974). Sadly, while Michael Winner displayed some talent as a director during his career, it seems that he was not a particularly nice guy. Following his death, in October 2017, three different women accused him of demanding that they show him their breasts. In 2019 actress  Marina Sirtis intimated that she had been abused by Winner.Winner was not the only person working on The Jokers who was on a bit of a roll in the Sixties. Although now best known for the musical The Phantom of the Opera, in the Sixties Michael Crawford established himself with roles in such films as The War Lover (1962), The Knack …and How to Get It (1965), and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum  (1966). By the time he appeared in The Jokers, Oliver Reed could already be considered to be a big name. He established himself with several Hammer Films, among them The Curse of the Werewolf (1961), The Pirates of Blood River (1962), and Captain Clegg (1962). He also appeared in The System. Much of the rest of the cast of The Jokers is notable as well. James Donald, who plays Colonel Gurney-Simms, will be recognized by viewers from such movies as Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and The Great Escape (1963). Rachel Kempson, who had appeared in such films as Tom Jones (1963) and Georgy Girl (1966), played Michael and David's mother. British actor Peter Graves, who appeared in the films Give Us the Moon (1944), I'll Be Your Sweetheart (1945), and Alfie (1966), played their father. The Jokers was shot on location in London, with many of the city's best known tourist spots appearing in the film. Among the locations in the film are the Albert Memorial, the London Zoo, the Stock Exchange, Piccadilly Circus, the Old Bailey, and the Tower of London. In shooting The Jokers, Michael Winner would cause some problems for directors wanting to film in London in the future. A smoke bomb was set off during a scene shot at Piccadilly Circus, resulting in chaos around the area. Worse yet, Michael Winner took off in a taxi and left other crew members to be arrested. Because of this incident no movies were allowed to be filmed in Piccadilly Circus until An American Werewolf in London (1981).The Jokers premiered in New York City on May 15 1967 in New York City. It premiered in London on June 15 1967. It received largely positive reviews. Seen today The Jokers still holds up. For fans of Swinging London, the film offers a great look at many of the famous locations in the city at that particular time. As a caper film it features a particularly original heist. Indeed, while many caper movies see a team assembled for the robbery, in The Jokers it is only the Tremayne brothers who pull it off. As a comedy it is a funny send-up of the British aristocracy, media overkill, and even Swinging London itself."},

Prior to her acting career Miss Mimieux had done some professional modelling. She was only 15 when publicist Jim Byron discovered her on a Hollywood Hills bridle path. She took classes in singing and dancing, and she also acted in local theatre before she was signed by MGM in 1959.Yvette Mimieux made her television debut in an episode of Yancy Derringer in 1959. In 1960 she guest starred on One Step Beyond and Mr. Lucky. Her first credited role in a film was in Platinum High School in 1960. That same year she appeared in her breakout role as Weena in The Time Machine (1960). She followed it with the movie Where the Boys Are (1960).Yvette Mimieux began the Sixties with the movie The Light in the Piazza (1962). During the decade she appeared in the films The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1962), The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962), Diamond Head (1962), Toys in the Attic (1963), Looking for Love (1964), Joy in the Morning (1965), The Reward (1965), Monkeys, Go Home!

She appeared in the movies Forbidden Law, Night Partners, Obsessive Love, The Fifth Missile, and Perry Mason: The Case of the Desperate Deception. In 1992 She appeared in the TV movie Lady Boss.I sometimes think Yvette Mimieux was underrated as an actress. She gave an incredible performance in Where the Boys Are as Melanie, whose story took a turn to the tragic. She also did well as Olivia de Havilland's mentally disabled daughter in The Light in the Piazza. Even in her lesser known films, such as Three in the Attic and The Picasso Summer, she could be impressive. Yvette Mimieux's appearance has often been commented on, but I think her talent was much, much more remarkable."},
{"title": "Life with Elizabeth Starring Betty White", "date": "Monday, January 17, 2022", "text": "Today would have been the 100th birthday of Betty White. She was not simply a beloved actress and comedian whose career spanned 80 years, but also a true television pioneer. It was in 1951 that she appeared in her first sitcom, Life with Elizabeth. She was not only the star of the show, but she was also one of its producers. This made Betty White one of the first women to ever produce a sitcom in American television. Life with Elizabeth would prove to be a groundbreaking show in other ways as well.Life with Elizabeth centred on a married couple named Elizabeth (Betty White) and Alvin (Del Moore). Elizabeth was a mischievous sort and would often find herself in various misadventures. Usually after one of Elizabeth's various bits of mischief, announcer Jack Narz would ask her, \"Elizabeth, aren't you ashamed?\" Elizabeth would shake her head, before an impish grin would emerge on her face, showing that she was not ashamed at all. Each episode was divided into three plots, referred to as \"incidents,\" of eight to ten minutes each.Life with Elizabeth originated as a series of sketches on the talk and variety show Hollywood on Television that aired on KLAC in Los Angeles. The sketches featured Betty White as Elizabeth and her fellow host Al Jarvis as Alvin. Al Jarvis would leave Hollywood on Television in 1951 to be be replaced by Eddie Albert. Eddie Albert would leave after six months when he took another job. It was then in 1951 KLAC station manager Don Fedderson decided to spin-off the Elizabeth and Alvin sketches into their own show. Betty White, George Tibbles (who had been Betty's accompanist on Hollywood on Television), and Don Fedderson formed Bandy Productions to produce the new show. Initially Life with Elizabeth aired live on KLAC on Saturday night at 8:30 PM Pacific. The show certainly attracted attention, with Betty White receiving the Emmy for Best Actress in 1951. Despite this, Life with Elizabeth was not picked up by any of the networks. While the networks did not pick  up Life with Elizabeth, distribution and production company Guild Films approached Betty White, George Tibbles, and Don Fedderson about launching Life with Elizabeth into nationwide syndication. Ultimately, Bandy Productions and Guild Films entered into an agreement that would bring Life with Elizabeth to the entire United States.While Life with Elizabeth aired live in front of a studio audience at KLAC, the syndicated version of Life with Elizabeth would be filmed with a single camera. These episodes would then be shown in front of an audience, whose reactions would then be recorded. In this way the episodes of Life with Elizabeth would feature the genuine laughter of an audience rather than a laugh track. Life with Elizabeth proved attractive to television stations, with 27 stations signing up to air the series.Life with Elizabeth entered syndication in the fall of 1953. It ended its run in 1955 and after 65 episodes. While the show was still popular, Guild Films thought ending the show while it was still popular would help maximize profits for the existing episodes. The show would  be rerun on local stations for years to come. Although largely forgotten today, Life with Elizabeth was a pioneering sitcom. It certainly gave Betty White her first national exposure and thus launched her long career. As Betty White as also a co-producer on the show, with Life with Elizabeth she also became one of the first women in television to produce a show. Indeed, Betty had nearly total creative control over the show, something that was unusual in the early Fifties. Life with Elizabeth was also groundbreaking in breaking with the standard sitcom format, well-established on radio even before the first television sitcoms aired. Being divided into three \"incidents\" per show, it was a sharp contrast to such contemporary sitcoms as I Love Lucy and My Little Margie, which concentrated on one plot per episode.Life with Elizabeth was also the first nationwide show produced by Don Fedderson, who would o onto a long career in television. He would also produce Betty White's next sitcom, Date with the Angels. He would go onto produce such shows as The Millionaire, My Three Sons, and Family Affair, .Life with Elizabeth deserves to be better known than it is. It is a very funny show, demonstrating that Betty White had wit and comic timing from the very beginning. And it is every bit as much a pioneering sitcom as I Love Lucy is. Episodes of Life with Elizabeth are readily available on various streaming services as well as the Internet Archive. Anyone who loves Betty White, 1950s sitcoms, or classic television is encouraged to check it out."},
{"title": "The 50th Anniversary of Sanford and Son", "date": "Friday, January 14, 2022", "text": "It was 50 years ago today, on January 14 1972,  that the sitcom Sanford and Son debuted on NBC. Sanford and Son centred on junk dealer Fred G. Sanford (Redd Foxx) and his son Lamont (Demond Wilson). Fred was a bit lazy, sarcastic, and prone to get rich schemes. As to Lamont, he simply wanted to expand his horizons beyond his father's junkyard. The conflict between the two fuelled the plots of many of the show's episodes throughout the show's run. Sanford and Son proved to be a hit upon its debut and ranked no. 6 for the year in the Nielsens during its first season. Ultimately Sanford and Son remained in the top ten shows each year for five of its six seasons.Sanford and Son was based on the hit British sitcom Steptoe and Son. Debuting in 1962 on BBC 1, Steptoe and Son was phenomenally successful in the Untied Kingdom. At its height, up to 25 million viewers (around half the population of Britain) tuned into Steptoe and Son. Such success did not go unnoticed in the United States, so that movie producer Joseph E. Levine bought the rights to do an American version of the show. Produced in 1965, the pilot featured Lee Tracy as Albert Steptoe and Aldo Ray as his son Harold. The pilot failed to sell and never aired in the United States. One further attempt at another American pilot got no further than the planning stages.Joseph E. Levine retained the rights to an American version of Steptoe and Son until 1971. Once Mr. Levine's rights had lapsed, Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin bought the rights to do an American version of the show. At the time Mr. Lear was fresh from his success with All in the Family, itself an adaptation of the hit British sitcom Till Death Do Us Part. With Norman Lear preoccupied with All in the Family, Bud Yorkin brought Aaron Ruben, a veteran of such sitcoms as The Phil Silvers Show and The Andy Griffith Show, onto the project. A pilot was shot with Bernard Hughes as an Irish American junk dealer and Paul Sorvino as his son who favoured his mother's Italian side. This pilot never made it to series. It was then decided that their junk dealer and son in their American version of Steptoe and Son should be Black. Messrs. Yorkin and Ruben approached Cleavon Little about doing the pilot, but he declined due to other commitments. While Mr. Little was unable to do the pilot, he did suggest to them comedian Redd Foxx. Redd Foxx had appeared in the movie Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970) with Cleavon Little. He played the character of junk dealer Uncle Budd. Redd Foxx was a comedian with a successful nightclub act and was even one of the first Black comedians to play the Las Vegas Strip.Redd Foxx would have an enormous impact on shaping Sanford and Son. He even gave the show its name. Redd Foxx was born James Elroy Sanford. His older brother, Fred Sanford, Jr. provided his character's first name. While the majority of first season episodes were based directly on Steptoe and Son scripts, it differed from the British sitcom in that Redd Foxx brought a strong dose of Black comedy to Sanford and Son. Race was never too far from the forefront on Sanford and Son. For the role of Fred's son Lamont, Demond Wilson was cast. Mr. Wilson had played a burglar in the All in the Family episode \"\"Edith Writes a Song.\"Rehearsals for the pilot began in August 1971 at CBS's Fairfax Studio. Given All in the Family had been a success for CBS, Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin tried to interest that network's executives in attending rehearsals, but none of them did. Bud Yorkin then contacted his old friend Herb Schlosser, then NBC's vice president in charge of West Coast programming. Curiously, Mr. Schlosser had made the deal to get the rights to Steptoe and Son for the earlier pilot produced by Joseph E. Levine and starring Lee Tracy and Aldo Ray. Being familiar with both Steptoe and Son and Redd Foxx's comedy, Herb Schlosser was immediately interested. He then arranged for Mort Werner, NBC's senior vice president for programming, to attend the taping of the pilot. Messrs. Schosser and Werner then had to venture onto their archrival network's territory, the pilot being shot at CBS. In the end NBC committed to picking up 17 episodes of Sanford and Son, set to start in January 1972. Sanford and Son debuted on January 14 1972 to generally positive reviews. Joan Crosby in the \"TV Scout\" syndicated newspaper column wrote of the show, \"Good news: Sanford and Son is a funny program.\" Joyce Haber, columnist for The Los Angeles Times, wrote, \"And if my opinion means anything, it's warm but stingingly hilarious, sharply written (by Aaron Ruben) and timed show which deserves the top honour.\" The New York Daily News named Sanford and Son, \"...a warm, funny show.\" This is not to say that some did not have a negative view of the show, especially in the Black community. Walter Burrell, columnist for Soul magazine, was particularly critical of how Lamont treated Fred in the early episodes, writing, \"To say the younger man was disrespectful would be an understatement.\" As late as June 17 1973, after which the show had seen considerable success, Eugenia Collier wrote in The New York Times, \"For in spite of Redd Foxx's jokes and Demond Wilson's black beauty, Sanford and Son remains white to the core.\"Audiences obviously agreed with the majority of positive reviews rather than the minority of negative ones. For the week ending January 16 1972, the premiere of Sanford and Son came in at no. 5 in the Nielsen ratings. Over the following weeks it continued to be successful, ultimately ranking no. 6 for the 1971-1972 season. It would be even more successful in its second season, ranking no. 2 for the year, right behind All in the Family.While Sanford and Son was a hit from the beginning, it would take some time for it to become the show that most of us remember. In the first season Lamont could be rather hard on his father, and could even be perceived as disrespectful at times. Lamont even referred to Fred's girlfriend Donna Harris (Lynn Hamilton) as \"the barracuda\" and would even go so far as to try to sabotage Fred and Donna's relationship. Among the critics of Lamont's attitude towards his father were no less than Redd Foxx and Desmond Wilson themselves. Fortunately Aaron Ruben softened Lamount's attitude towards Fred and their relationship became a warmer, more loving one. Lamont's attitude towards Donna was even changed, to where he was even friendly towards her. In the end, Lamont became a character who, while at times annoyed by his father's behaviour, was still devoted to him.Another way in which the first season of Sanford and Son differed from the show most of us remember is that many of its most memorable characters were not yet on the show. The first season would see the introduction of only three of the show's best known characters. The first was Officer \"Smitty\" Smith (Hal Williams), a Black police officer whose beat includes Fred's neighbourhood. Smitty's original partner on the show was Officer \"Swanny\" Swanhauser (Noam Pitlik), who would speak in police jargon that Smitty would have to translate for Fred. He was replaced early in the second season by Officer Howard \"Hoppy\" Hopkins, who would  not only speak in police jargon, but would always get slang terms wrong (for instance, \"right up\" instead of \"right on\").  Also appearing in the first season was Fred's girlfriend Donna Harris, a practical nurse who tended to be so sweet natured that she was even able to tolerate Fred's antics for the most part.It was the second season that would see the arrival of Fred's best known foil, Aunt Esther (LaWanda Page). In the first season Fred's primary antagonist was Aunt Ethel (Beah Richards), who was constantly expressing her disapproval of the junk dealer. It was in the second season that she was replaced by Aunt Esther. Aunt Esther was the sister of Fred's late wife Elizabeth and had never approved of the marriage. While Esther loves her nephew Lamont and he loves her as well, she has nothing but disdain for Fred. A devout Christian, she often calls him, \"You old heathen!\" Despite being a devout Christian, it was not unusual for her to threaten Fred with violence and she would even hit him with her purse from time to time. LaWanda Page, who played Esther, had met Redd Foxx when they were both still in elementary school in St. Louis. And like Redd Foxx, she would have a successful career in stand-up comedy. She had actually decided to leave show business when Redd Foxx asked her to audition for the role of Esther.Lamont's friend Rollo (Nathaniel Taylor) was also introduced in the second season. Rollo had spent time in jail, and so Fred remained convinced he was a criminal. What is more, Fred never missed a chance to remind Rollo of that fact. Nathaniel Taylor was also a former resident of St. Louis, and it was in part due to this fact that he was cast in the role of Rollo. It was also in the second season that Fred's friend Bubba (Don Bexley) was introduced. Bubba was a jovial fellow who would eagerly take part in any of Fred's get-rich-quick schemes. He always greeted Fred with a loud, bellowing, \"Hey, Fred!,\" something that not only got on Lamont's nerves, but Fred's as well. Like Redd Foxx and LaWanda Page, Don Bexley was also a stand-up comedian and he and Mr. Foxx had met while working as stand-up comedians.Even though he is now closely associated with the show, Fred's best friend Grady Wilson (Whitman Mayo) would not join Sanford and Son until the second episode of the third season. Grady was good-natured and easy going, but, not terribly bright. Like Bubba, he also often became involved in Fred's get-rich-quick schemes. Grady was a devoted friend and his feelings could be easily hurt. Grady became one of the most popular characters on the show, so much he would eventually received his own spin-off series. Although Grady was in his sixties, at the time Whitman Mayo was playing him, he was only in his forties.Among the other recurring characters was Julio Fuentes (Gregory Siera), Fred and Lamont's Puerto Rican next door neighbour and fellow junk dealer. Fred would often hurl ethnic slurs at Julio and even say that he should return to Puerto Rico (even though Julio was from New York City). In contrast, Julio always remained friendly towards Fred. Despite constantly insulting Julio, Fred does seem to like him deep down in side. When a local elementary school wants to demote Julio's nephew to a lower grade because he is not proficient in English, it is Fred who takes up for him. May Hopkins (Nancy Kulp), Officer Hoppy Hopkins's mother, started appearing in the fifth season. She rents a room at the Sanford Arms, the boarding house that Fred and Lamont opened after Julio sold them his property and moved away. Sanford and Son featured its share of famous guest stars. George Foreman, Lena Horne, B. B. King all guest starred as themselves. The show also featured such well known guest stars as Jack Carter, Scatman Crothers, Greg Morris, Frank Nelson, and Mary Wickes.Sanford and Son continued to be a hit in its third season, coming in at no. 3 for the year. All would not run smoothly for NBC during that season. Despite being a show centred on a Black junk dealer and his son, the majority of writers on Sanford and Son were white. At the same time, the show was a huge hit and Redd Foxx was only receiving $19,000 per episode. Redd Foxx then demanded 25% ownership of the show. When his demands weren't answered, he walked out. For the remaining six episodes of the third season, it was explained that Fred had gone to St. Louis to attend his cousin's funeral. Grady then took over the running of the Sanford household. The success of these episodes featuring only Grady and Lamont would be part of the reason that Grady would receive his own spin-off. Grady had the character move in with his daughter's family who lived in Westwood. The show debuted on December 4 1974. It did not repeat the success of Sanford and Son, lasting only ten episodes. After the spin-off ended, Grady returned to Sanford and Son.As to Redd Foxx's salary dispute, it resulted in a lawsuit from Tandem Productions. Eventually the salary dispute was resolved, with Redd Foxx receiving a raise of $25,000 per episode and 25% of the producers' net profits. Redd Foxx then returned to the show for its fourth season.That fourth season proved to be more successful than its third, with the show rising once more to no. 2 in the Nielsen ratings for the year. Sanford and Son would not maintain that level of success for long. It dropped to no. 7 for the year in its fifth season. In its sixth season it dropped to no. 27 for the year. Of course, coming in at no. 27 for the year was more than enough for NBC to renew the show, but circumstances would ultimately result in the show's end. ABC drew Redd Foxx away from NBC with an offer of a multimillion dollar contract and his own variety show. Sanford and Son then ended with its sixth season. As it turned out, Redd Foxx might have wished he had remained with Sanford and Son. The Redd Foxx Comedy Hour only lasted from September 15 1977 to January 26 1978.In attempt to salvage the situation, NBC decided to continue Sanford and Son after a fashion. Initially it was planned for Demond Wilson to star, but he left following a salary dispute. A new lead character was then introduced, Phil Wheeler (Theodore Wilson), an old friend of Fred, who bought the Sanford property after Fred and Lamont had moved to Arizona. Still appearing on the show were Esther, Bubba, and Grady. The focus of the show was shifted to the boarding house that Fred and Lamont had opened, the Sanford Arms. Sanford Arms did not last long. Although eight episodes were made, only four episodes aired before the show was cancelled. While Sanford Arms was a failure, it was not the last that television would see of Fred Sanford. By 1979 NBC had fallen in its fortunes. It was perhaps for that reason that then President of NBC Fred Silverman decided to lure Redd Foxx back to the network to play Fred Sanford once again. While Redd Foxx would return as Fred, Demond Wilson was not returning as Lamont. The new series, simply titled Sanford, then gave Fred a new partner in the junk business. Cal Petite (Dennis Burkley) was jovial Texan and eternal optimist. Of characters from the original show, only Rollo (who now worked for Fred) and Officers Smitty and Hoppy appeared in the first season. The second season saw Esther join the show as a regular character, and Grady appeared in two episodes. Sanford was ultimately not the success that Sanford and Son was, and it ended its run on July 10 1981.In many ways Sanford and Son was a groundbreaking series. Prior to its debut only a few sitcoms had centred on Black characters. In the Fifties there was Amos and Andy and Beulah, both of which featured offensive stereotypes. Julia debuted in 1968 and broke new ground in centring on a Black woman who was not portrayed as a stereotype. It was followed in 1969 by The Bill Cosby Show, which marked the first time an African American starred in his own self-titled show. While both Julia and The Bill Cosby Show saw some success, it would be Sanford and Son that would lead to the creation of several sitcoms centred on Black characters during the Seventies. Good Times, The Jeffersons, What's Happening!!, and others owed their existence largely to the success of Sanford and Son.Beyond spurring the creation of other sitcoms centred on Black characters, Sanford and Son also brought Black comedy into the mainstream. Prior to Sanford and Son, the only exposure much of the United States might have to Black comedy was appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and other variety shows of such comedians as Moms Mabley, Pigmeat Markham, Slappy White, and even Redd Foxx himself, as well as others. Redd Foxx was able to incorporate a good deal of his own comedy into Sanford and Son. He also consistently cast his fellow Black comedians on the show, including Don Bexley, Leroy & Skillet, LaWanda Page, and Slappy White. The show would eventually use Black writers as well. Richard Pryor wrote episodes, as did Paul Mooney. Along with The Flip Wilson Show, Sanford and Son may well have been the first exposure many white people had to Black humour. Prior to its debut, Sanford and Son was often touted as NBC's answer to All in the Family. While Sanford and Son was never overtly political the way that All in the Family was (Fred did not stand around talking about politics), various issues of concern to its Black viewers were addressed on the show. Indeed, Sanford and Son was set in Watts in Los Angeles. As a result there were occasional reference to the Watts Uprising of 1965 and social unrest in general. The Los Angeles Police Department was at times satirized through the characters of Smitty and Hoppy. The poverty in which Fred and Lamont lived was always close to the forefront of episodes. For much of the Sixties sitcoms portrayed people firmly belonging to the middle class. Even Julia on the TV Show Julia and Chet Kincaid on The Bill Cosby Show were part of the middle class. In contrast, the Sanfords were poor. While Fred owned his own business, the two of them often had to make due with regards to food. There were times they couldn't pay their bills. One often got the feeling that Fred was always in danger of losing his business. Many Americans, not just African Americans, could probably more identify with Fred and Lamont than they could the Bradys on The Brady Bunch or even the Bunkers on All in the Family, let alone the various other middle class families on television in the early Seventies.  Sanford and Son proved to be a hit upon its debut and it would have a highly successful run in syndication. It currently airs on TV One and can be seen on several streaming services. What is more, its success sees no chance of ending. It is safe to say Sanford and Son will be around for another fifty years."},
{"title": "The Late Great Ronnie Spector", "date": "Wednesday, January 12, 2022", "text": "Ronnie Spector, best known as the lead singer of The Ronettes, died today, Wednesday, January 12 2022, at the age 78 after a short battle with cancer. Ronnie Spector was born Veronica Bennett on August 10 1943 in New York City. Her mother was of African American/Cherokee descent and her father was Irish American. Young Ronnie, along with her sister Estelle and their cousin Nedra Talley, would go to their grandmother's house on Saturday where much of their time was spent singing. It as in 1957 that she formed her own girl group, consisting of Estelle, Nedra, and their other cousins Diane and Elaine. Eventually a male cousin, Ira, was added to the group. The group performed at a Wednesday amateur night at the Apollo Theatre, at which Ira was to be the lead singer. When he failed to sing, it was Ronnie who took over the lead vocals. Following that amateur night at the Apollo, Ira, Diane, and Elaine left the group. The remaining members (Ronnie, Estelle, and Nedra) started taking singing lessons The three of them performed at sock hops and bar mitzvahs. Under the name Ronnie and the Relatives, they were eventually signed to Colpix Records. The label issued the singles \"I Want a Boy\" and \"I'm Gonna Quit While I'm Ahead,\" neither of which charted. Renamed The Ronettes, their next single was a cover of The Rays \"Silhouettes.\" Both it and a reissue of \"I'm Gonna Quit While I'm Ahead\" failed to chart.Unhappy with Colpix, it was Estelle who got in touch with producer Phil Spector. The Ronettes auditioned for Spector. Initially he wanted to sign only Ronnie, but Ronnie's mother made it clear that he had to sign the whole group or there would be no deal. Regardless, The Ronette recorded the single \"Chubby Danny D\"/\"Why Don't They Let Us Fall in Love,\" which was released under Ronnie's given name \"Veronica.\" It failed to chart. The Ronettes would record more songs for Phil Spector, including covers of \"The Twist\", \"The Wah-Watusi,\" and \"Mashed Potato Time,\" but the songs were credited to another one of Spector's groups, The Crystals.It was finally in July 1963 that The Ronettes recorded the song \"Be My Baby.\" The song proved not only to be their first hit, but their biggest hit ever. It reached no. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. It would be followed by the hits \"Baby, I Love You,\" \"(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up,\" \"Do I Love You?,\" and \"Walking in the Rain.\" They were also featured on the classic Christmas album A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records, performing the songs \"Frosty the Snowman,\" \"Sleigh Ride,\" and .    \"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.\" Unfortunately, by early 1965 The Ronettes' fortunes had begun to change. Their single \"Born to Be Together\" only reached no. 52 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their next few singles performed even more poorly. It was then in 1967 that The Ronettes broke up.In 1969 Ronnie Spector recorded \"You Came, You Saw, You Conquered,\" which was released on A&M Records and credited to The Ronettes Featuring the Voice of Veronica, even though none of the other Ronettes appeared on the record. It was in 1971 that Ronnie Spector recorded the song \"Try Some, Buy Some,\" which was written by George Harrison and released on The Beatles' label Apple Records. It was in 1972 that Ronnie Spector, who had married Phil Spector in 1968, left him after years of abuse. Unfortunately, in the 1974 settlement between the two she gave up all of her future record earnings. It would not be until the Nineties that Ronnie Spector was able to receive $1 million in royalties from Phil Spector after years of legal battles.  It was in 1973 that  Ronnie Spector formed a new version of The Ronettes, with two new members. They recorded as Ronnie and The Ronettes. They released two singles (\"Lover Lover\" and \"I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine\") on Buddah Records, neither of which charted. By 1975 Ronnie Spector had returned to being a solo act and over the next few years released the singles \"You'd Be Good for Me,\" \"Paradise,\" \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood,\" \"It's a Heartache,\" and \"Darlin'.\" In 1976 she sang a duet with Southside Johnny on Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes' song\"You Mean So Much to Me.\" In 1980 her first solo album, Siren, was released. In 1986 she sang on Eddie Money's single \"Take Me Home Tonight.\" In 1987 her second solo album, Unfinished Business, was released. It was in 1988 that she began performing Ronnie Spector's Christmas Party each Christmas season at B.B. King Blues Club & Grill in New York City. In 1999 her EP She Talks to Rainbows was released. It was produced by Joey Ramone and Daniel Rey. She released two more EPs (Something's Gonna Happen in 2003 and Best Christmas Ever in 2010) and two more albums The Last of the Rock Stars and English Heart. English Heart proved to be a hit, reaching no 6 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Chart. Ronnie Spector also sang backing vocals on The Raveonettes' song \"Ode to LA\" from their album 2005 Pretty in Black.The word \"legend\" is sometimes overused, but it is certainly appropriate to call Ronnie Spector a legend.  She had an incredible voice, absolutely powerful and one of a kind. She could convey joy, sorrow, and every emotion in between with ease. With The Ronettes she also changed girl groups forever. While previous girl groups tended to be nearly virginal, The Ronettes were open in their sex appeal. As Ronnie Spector said in her memoir, Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness, \"We weren't afraid to be hot. That was our gimmick.\" Ultimately, Ronnie Spector and The Ronettes would have a lasting impact on future music artists. Artists from The Ramones to The Raveonettes to Amy Winehouse were all influenced by them. Ronnie Spector's success on the charts may have been short-lived, but their impact on music will last forever."},
{"title": "The Late Great Peter Bogdanovich", "date": "Monday, January 10, 2022", "text": "Film historian, director, and actor Peter Bogdanovich died on January 6 2022 at the age of 82. The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease.Peter Bogdanovich was born on July 30 1939 in Kingston, New York. He grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Both his father and mother were immigrants. His father was Serbian and his mother was Austrian. When he was young his father would take Peter Bogdanovich to see silent movies at the Museum of Modern Art. He was still very young when he fell in love with the cinema, so much so that by the time he was 12 he would keep a file of index cards in which he would assess the movies he had seen. He was a teenager when he studied acting under Stella Adler. He acted Off Broadway and in summer stock. In 1958 he made his television debut in an episode of Kraft Television Theatre. He directed an Off Broadway revival of The Big Knife when he was 20. It was around the same time that he started writing about the cinema. He was published in such venues as Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post, and even the French magazine Cahiers du Cinéma. He served as a film programmer for both the New Yorker Theatre and the Museum of Modern Art. It was in 1961 that his first book, The Cinema of Orson Welles, was published. Over the decades it would be followed by The Cinema of Howard Hawks, The Cinema of Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Fritz Lang in America, Allan Dwan, and other books on the cinema. His early articles on film were collected in the 1973 book Pieces of Time. He recorded several hours of conversation with Orson Welles, which would ultimately result in the 1992 book This is Orson Welles. He also wrote the book Killing of the Unicorn: Dorothy Stratten 1960–1980, which dealt with his relationship with actress Dorothy Stratten, and A Year and a Day Engagement Calendar 1992: A Desk Diary Adapted From the Works of Robert Graves.It was in 1964 that Peter Bogdanovich moved to Hollywood to break into the film industry. There he met Roger Corman, who gave him a job. He served as an assistant director on Mr. Corman's The Wild Angels (1966). Roger Corman produced Peter Bogdanovich's first film, Targets (1968). Targets was followed by the American International Pictures movie Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women, which Mr. Bogdanovich directed under the name Derek Thomas. It was in 1971 that Peter Bogdanovich's breakthrough movie was released, The Last Picture Show. It received eight Academy Award nominations and won the Oscars for Best Supporting Actor for Ben Johnson and Best Supporting Actress for Cloris Leachman. Mr. Bogdoanovich followed it with the hit screwball comedy What's Up, Doc? (1972) and the period piece Paper Moon (1973). Unfortunately, Mr. Bogdanovich's next few movies would not be successful. Daisy Miller (1974), At Last Long Love (1975), and Nickelodeon (1976) did poorly at the box office and poorly with critics. His lower budget 1979 film Saint Jack was better received.To a degree the Eighties would be better for Peter Bogdanovich as a director than the late Seventies had been. They All Laughed (1981) received some good reviews, but ultimately failed at the box office. In contrast, Mask (1985) proved to be a box office hit and to be critically acclaimed. Unfortunately his next two films, Illegally Yours (1988) and Texaville (1990) would be both critical and box office failures.In the Nineties Peter Bogdanovich turned to directing television. During the decade he directed episodes of Picture Windows, Fallen Angels, and The Wonderful World of Disney. He directed the TV movies Prowler; To Sir, with Love II; The Price of Heaven; Rescuers: Stories of Courage: Two Women; and Naked City: A Killer Christmas. He directed two feature films during the decade: Noises Off (1992) and The Thing Called Love (1993). In the Naughts he directed the film She's Funny That Way (2001). On television he directed an episode of The Mystery of Natalie Wood and an episode of the TV show The Sopranos. He directed the TV movie Hustle. In the Teens he directed the documentary The Great Buster (2018), about Buster Keaton. While much of Peter Bodanovich's life was dedicated to writing and directing, he continued to act from time to time. He appeared in the film Lion's Love in 1969. He also played a role in his own film Saint Jack. In the Eighties he guest starred as himself on an episode of Moonlighting. In the Nineties he guest starred on the TV shows Northern Exposure (playing himself)), Picture Windows, and Cybil  (playing himself). He in the TV movies Bella Mafia and Rated X. In 2000 he started playing the recurring role of Dr. Kuperferberg, the psychiatrist to Tony Soprano's psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi. He appeared in the movies Mr. Jealousy (1997),  Highball (1997), 54 (1998), Coming Soon (1999), and The Independent (2000). In the Naughts Mr. Bogdanovich continued to appear on The Sopranos. He appeared in the mini-series Out of Order. He guest starred on the shows 8 Simple Rules, The Simpsons, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, and How I Met Your Mother (as himself). He appeared in the movies Festival in Cannes (2001), The Definition of Insanity (2004), Infamous (2006), Dedication (2007), Broken English (2007), The Dukes (2007), The Fifth Patient (2007), The Doorman (2007), Humboldt County (2008), and Queen of the Lot (2010). In the Teens he guest starred on the show Rizzoli & Isles. He had a recurring role on the show Get Shorty. He appeared in the movies Don't Let Me Go (2013), Cold Turkey (2013), Are You Here (2013), While We're Young (2014), Pearly Gates (2015), Durant's Never Closes (2016), The Tell-Tale Heart (2016), Between Us (2016), Six LA Love Stories (2016), Los Angeles Overnight (2018), Reborn (2018), The Other Side of the World (2018), The Creatress (2019), It Chapter Two (2019), and Willie and Me (2020). Peter Bogdanovich was closely associated with Turner Classic Movies. In 2005 he hosted their program The Essentials. He also attended multiple TCM Classic Film Festivals. In 2020 he was the subject of TCM's podcast The Plot Thickens.Peter Bogdanovich has long been one of my favourite directors. In fact, it is fully possible that What's Up, Doc? was the first screwball comedy I ever saw. When I was older was able to see such comedies as Bringing Up Baby and The Awful Truth, and I realized just how much What's Up, Doc? had drawn upon the screwball comedies of the Golden Age for inspiration. They All Laughed is another favourite of mine. When I first saw it I thought that critics and audiences had seriously undervalued it. Paper Moon captured the Depression very well, while remaining very funny. Of course, while Mr. Bogdanovich was good at comedy, he was equally adept at drama. The Last Picture Show remains a classic to this day.Of course, if Peter Bogdanovich was a great director, it is perhaps because he knew so much about the Golden Age of Hollywood. Mr. Bogdanovich was an excellent film historian, writing several books and making documentaries about the subject. Through  it all his love of classic film showed through. More so than many, he did a good deal to spread love for classic film. He was certainly remarkable as both a director and film historian."},
{"title": "Godspeed Dwayne Hickman", "date": "Sunday, January 9, 2022", "text": "Dwayne Hickman, best known for playing Dobie Gillis in the sitcom The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, died today, January 9 2022, at the age of 87. The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease. Dwayne Hickman was born on May 18 1934 in Los Angeles. His older brother was actor Darryl Hickman, who appeared in such films as The Grapes of Wrath (1940) Leave Her To Heaven (1947). Dwayne Hickman received his first credited role when he was nine years old with the film Captain Eddie (1945). In the late Forties he appeared in several movies, including The Return of Rusty (1946), The Secret Heart (1946), The Boy with Green Hair (1948), and The Happy Years (1950). He appeared in six of Columbia's eight \"Rusty\" films, which followed the adventures of a dog named Rusty. Dwayne Hickman made his television debut in an episode of The Lone Ranger in 1951. It was in 1955 that he began playing the regular role of Chuck McDonald, the girl crazy, teenage nephew of Bob Collins (Bob Cummings) on The Bob Cummings Show. It was his role on The Bob Cummings Show that would lead him being cast in the title role on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. While Mr. Hickman played the teen-aged Dobie on the show, he was 25 years old at the time. During the Fifties Dwayne Hickman guest starred on such shows as Public Defender, The Loretta Young Show, Lux Video Theatre, The Stu Erwin Show, Waterfront, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, and Men of Annapolis. He appeared in the movie Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys! (1958) and provided the voice of Mr. Magoo's nephew in the animated feature 1001 Arabian Nights (1959). In the Sixties Dwayne Hickman continued to star on Dobie Gillis. After the show's end he guest starred on such shows as The Greatest Show on Earth, Valentine's Day, Wagon Train, Combat!, Vacation Playhouse, Ironside, Insight, The Flying Nun, My Friend Tony, Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Colour, The Mod Squad, and Love, American Style. Mr. Hickman appeared in several of American International Pictures' \"Beach Party\" movies and films related to the \"Beach Party\" films, including Ski Party (1965), How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (1965), Sergeant Dead Head (1965), and Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine (1965).

In the Seventies Dwayne Hickman guest starred on the TV shows Love, American Style; Karen; Kolchak: The Night Stalker; and Ellery Queen. He reprised his role as Dobie Gillis in the failed pilot Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?. In the Seventies he worked for a time as entertainment director for Howard Hughes’ Landmark Hotel in Las Vegas. From 1977 to 1988 he was a programming executive at CBS.In the Eighties Dwayne Hickman reprised his role as Dobie Gillis in the television reunion movie Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis in 1988. He also appeared in the TV movie High School U.S.A. and he guest stared on the show Murder, She Wrote. In 1989 he began directing TV shows.

His last appearance was a cameo in the movie Angels with Angles (2005).Later in life Dwayne Hickman developed painting as a hobby.I have been a fan of Dobie Gillis since I first saw it in reruns when I was young. Dwayne Hickman was perfect in the role of Dobie, the at times scheming teenager who wants money, popularity, and, to paraphrase the show's theme song, a girl to call his own. Mr. Hickman's was convincing as Dobie, which was remarkable given he was 25 at the time. Dwayne Hickman also did well in the role of Bob's nephew Chuck on The Bob Cummings Show. Chuck was always trying to get his Uncle Bob's attention, not to mention having his head turned by some pretty girl or another. Of course, while Dwayne Hickman will always remain best known as Dobie Gillis, he played other roles. In Cat Ballou he played Jed, the con man who disguises himself as a preacher to spring his nephew from jail. In Doctor, You've Got Be Kidding, he played a shoe salesman who is an actor on the side. As an actor he specializes in death scenes.In the Ellery Queen episode \"The Adventure of the Wary Witness,\" he played one of Ellery's old school chums accused of murdering a mobster. Dwayne Hickman could play a variety of roles and he had a real gift for comedy. His timing was perfect. While he'll always be remembered as Dobie Gillis, he did so much more."},
{"title": "To Sir Sidney Poitier, with Love", "date": "Friday, January 7, 2022", "text": "The impact of Sidney Poitier on film history cannot be overestimated. Throughout his career he played Black characters who were not stereotypes. He was not only the first Black actor to win the Oscar for Best Actor, but he was the first major Black movie star. When he began directing movies in the Seventies, he was one of the few Black men to do so. He was active in the civil rights movement and took part in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28 1963. Very few, if any, have done as much as Sidney Poitier did to change the film industry and make it more inclusive. Sadly, Sir Sidney Poitier died yesterday, January 6 2022, at the age of 94.Sidney Poitier was born on February 20 1927 in Miami, Florida to Bahamian farmers who would sell their produce there. He was born two months premature and his birth was unexpected for that reason. He spent the first ten years of his life on Cat Island, Bahamas. His family then moved to Nassau, Bahamas. He was fifteen yeas old when he was sent to Miami to live with his brother's family. He was sixteen years old when he moved to New York City and worked as a dishwasher, a ditch digger, a waterfront labourer, and a delivery man. During World War II Mr. Poitier enlisted in the United States Army by lying about his age. He served in a Veteran's Administration hospital in Northport, New York, where he was to help psychiatric patients. Sidney Poitier was offended by the cruel treatment that the patients received from many of the staff. After ten months he could no longer take seeing the patients abused and he pretended to be mentally disturbed in order to get out of the Army. Fortunately the psychiatrist who examined him proved to be sympathetic when Mr. Poitier explained his plight, and after five weeks gave him a release on the grounds of being mentally unfit.It was in The Amsterdam News that Sidney Poitier read that the American Negro Theatre was seeking actors. Because he still had a thick West Indian accent, his first audition did not go well. Mr. Poitier then bought a radio and practised his English while listening to the announcers. A fellow co-worker helped him with his English. Even after all this work, he was only able to win a place at the American Negro Theatre after volunteering to work as a janitor for free. His big break came when Harry Belafonte failed to show up at a rehearsal that was attended by a Broadway producer. The producer took notice of Mr. Poitier and he was cast in an all-Black production of Lysistrata on Broadway in 1946. He was then cast in a Broadway production of Anna Lucasta in 1947. Sidney Poitier's work on stage led to an offer from Darryl F. Zanuck to work in the film No Way Out (1950). In the film he played a Black doctor who must treat a white racist criminal (Richard Widmark). Over the next few years he appeared in the films Cry, the Beloved County (1951), Red Ball Express (1952), and Go Man Go (1954). His breakout role came with The Blackboard Jungle (1955), playing a rebellious high school student. He was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor in Leading Role for The Defiant Ones (1958). Over the next few years he also appeared in the films Good-Bye, My Lady (1956), Edge of the City (1957), Something of Value (1957), Band of Angles (1957), The Mark of the Hawk (1957), Virgin Island (1958), Porgy and Bess (1959), and All the Young Men (1960). Sidney Poitier appeared on Broadway in A Raisin in the Sun. He made his television debut in 1952 in an episode of CBS Television Workshop. During the Fifties he guest starred on such shows as Omnibus, Kraft Television Theatre, and The Philco Television Playhouse. Sidney Poitier began the Sixties with the film adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun in 1961. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Lillie in the Field (1963). In 1967 he was the highest grossing movie star, appearing the movies To Sir, with Love (1967), In the Heat of the Night (1967), and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967). He also appeared in the movies Paris Blues (1961), Pressure Point (1962), The Long Ships (1964), The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), The Bedford Incident (1965), The Slender Thread (1965), A Patch of Blue (195), Duel at Diablo (1966), For Love of Ivy (1968), The Lost Man (1969), and They Call Me Mister Tibbs! (1970). He appeared ion Broadway in Carry Me Back to Morningside Heights in 1970. In the Seventies Sidney Poitier appeared in the films Brother John (1971), The Organization (1971), Buck and the Preacher (1972), A Warm December (1973), Uptown Saturday Night (1974), The Wilby Conspiracy (1975), Let's Do It Again (1975), and A Piece of the Action (1977). Mr. Poitier made his directorial debut in 1972 with Buck and the Preacher. In the Seventies he directed the films A Warm December (1973), Uptown Saturday Night (1974), Let's Do It Again (1975), A Piece of the Action (1977), and Stir Crazy (1980). In the Eighties Sidney Poitier starred in the movies Shoot to Kill (1988) and Little Nikita (1988). He directed the films Hanky Panky (1982), Fast Forward (1985), and Ghost Dad (1990). In the Nineties Mr. Poitier appeared on television in the mini-series Separate But Equal and Children of the Dust. He appeared in the TV movies To Sir, with Love II; Mandela and de Klerk; Free of Eden; David and Lisa; and The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn. He appeared in the movies Sneakers (1992) and The Jackal (1997). In 2001 he appeared in the The Last Brickmaker in America. Sidney Poitier truly broke barriers in film. He was both the first Black actor and the first Bahamian actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. He was also the first Black actor to win a BAFTA Award. Many of the films he made dealt with race, and he never played stereotypical roles. He was the first major Black movie star and as a result not only paved the way for other black actors, but helped increased diversity in Hollywood as well. When he began his directorial career in the Seventies, he was one of the few Black directors around. In interviews Sidney Poitier often credited his success to simply being in the right place at the right time, but it seems likely most of it was due to his talent. Throughout his career he played a variety of roles. He played a Black doctor in No Way Out. In The Defiant Ones he played a Black convict chained to a white convict who have just escaped prison. He was both the teacher Mark Thackeray in To Sir, with Love and the police detective Virgil Tibbs in In the Heat of the Night. Over the years he played everything from handyman Homer Smith in Lilies in the Field to widower Dr. Matt Younger in A Warm December. What is more, he also played all of these roles well. He was also a talented director, directing such classic films as Buck and the Preacher, A Warm December, Uptown Saturday night, and Stir Crazy. Sidney Poitier was also an activist and took part in the civil rights movement. Besides the March to Washington, he also took part in the Freedom Summer campaign in 1964 and the Poor People's Campaign in 1968. From 1997 to 2007 he was the Bahamian ambassador to Japan. He as the Bahamian ambassador to UNESCO from 2002 to 2007.Over the years Sidney Poitier received many honours. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974. In 2009 In 2009, Poitier was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama. In 1995 he received the Kennedy Center Honour. Over the years he won many awards,including an Oscar for Best Actor and an Honorary Oscar, A BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor and a BAFTA Academy Fellowship, and yet others. The many honours bestowed upon Sidney Poitier reflect his importance in the history of film and his talent as an actor. It was that talent that allowed him to break through barriers."},
{"title": "The Late, Entirely Wonderful Betty White", "date": "Tuesday, January 4, 2022", "text": "When Betty White died on December 31 2021 at the age of 99, there was was an outpouring of grief of the like I have never seen in my lifetime. At 99 Betty had a extremely long career. In fact, she holds the record for the performer with the longest career in American television to Guinness World Records. She made her debut on the medium in 1938 only three months after she had graduated high school, at which point television was still largely experimental. She was also a television pioneer, serving as a producer on her sitcom Life with Elizabeth when very few women worked behind the camera. Of course, Betty White was also immensely talented. She had perfect comic timing and could come up with funny lines off the top of her head. It was that talent that allowed her to appear as a regular on multiple television shows, including Life with Elizabeth, Date with the Angels, three different shows titled The Betty White Show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Mama's Family, The Golden Girls, and Hot in Cleveland. As long as her career was and as prolific as she was, I don't think that is why everyone loves Betty White so. Instead it was because Betty was always sunny in disposition and well known for her kindness to other people. While one occasionally hears a bad word about other celebrities, one never heard any about Betty White. The world loved Betty White not simply because she was an incredibly talented actress and comedian, but because she was a truly good person.Betty White was born on January 17 1922 in Oak Park, Illinois. In 1923 her family moved to Alhambra, California, at which point she was only a little over a year old. Her family later moved to Los Angeles. She graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1939. Betty White wanted to be a forest ranger, but at the time women weren't allowed to become rangers. She then decided to become an actress. It was only three months after she graduated high school that she made her television debut. She and one of her classmates sang songs from The Merry Widow on an experimental television show. She worked as a model. Her first professional work was at the Bliss Hayden Little Theatre. During World War II she joined the American Women's Voluntary Services. Among other things, she drove a PX truck with military supplies to Hollywood Hills during her service.Following World War II, Betty White resumed her career by working in radio. She had appeared on radio when she was only eight years old on the radio show The Empire Builders. As an adult she  read commercials on radio and played small parts on radio shows.Ultimately she would appear on such shows as Family Theatre, Blondie, The Great Gildersleeve, and This is Your FBI. She eventually received her own radio show, The Betty White Show. While Betty White had a successful carer in radio, it would be television that would be her medium. In 1949 Betty White began a long stint as the co-host of the live television variety and talk show Hollywood on Television. In 1951 she received her first Emmy nomination for Best Actress for her work on Hollywood on Television. In 1952 Betty White co-founded Bandy Productions with writer George Tibbles and producer Don Fedderson. Bandy Productions produced Betty White's sitcom, Life with Elizabeth, based on a character Betty had originated on Hollywood on Television. Life with Elizabeth centred on the title character played by Betty White, and her husband Alvin Del Moore). Elizabeth was a housewife with a mischievous streak and a tendency to get into various predicaments. Life with Elizabeth was very successful and ended its run only because Guild Films the show's production company, was worried about saturating secondary markets with the series. At about the same time Betty White was appearing in Life with Elizabeth, she was also appearing on her own variety show, The Betty White Show, on NBC. From 1957 to 1958 Betty White appeared in the classic sitcom Date with the Angels. During the Fifties Betty White also guest starred on The Millionaire and appeared on the game shows What's My Line?, To Tell the Truth, and Make the Connection, as well as Tonight Starring Jack Paar, In 1958 she hosted a revival of her variety and talk show The Betty White Show. In 1956 she began a 19 year stint hosting the Tournament of Roses Parade on NBC. In the Sixties Betty White continued to appear on Tonight Starring Jack and  Paar and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. She appeared frequently on game shows, including To Tell the Truth, You Don't Say, Password, What's My Line, The Match Game, It Takes Two, and others. She was a regular panel1ist on the game Liar's Club. She continued to host the Tournament of Roses Parade and she began hosting the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC with Lorne Greene in 1963. The two of them hosted the parade until 1972. She guest starred on the TV shows The United States Steel Hour, Another World, That's Life, and Petticoat Junction. Betty White made her film debut in Advise & Consent in 1962. In 1973 Betty White began playing man hungry Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. She remained with the show until its run ended. In 1977 she followed The Mary Tyler Moore Show with her own sitcom, The Betty White Show. On the series she played Joyce Whitman, the star of the fictional show Undercover Woman. She also guest starred on the shows The Odd Couple, Lucas Tanner, Ellery Queen, The Rich Little Show, The Diahann Carroll Show, The Jim Nabors Show, Donnie and Marie, The Carol Burnett Show, and The Love Boat. From 1971 to 1972 she hosted The Pet Set. Betty White continued to appear frequently on games shows including I've Got a Secret, It's Your Bet, Password, You Don't Say, Tattletales, The Hollywood Squares, and others. She also appeared on several talk shows, including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Mike Douglas Show, and Dinah!. Betty White appeared in The Paul Lyne Halloween Special, as well as the TV movies With This Ring, Snavely, The Best Place to Be, Before and After, and The Gossip Columnist. Her stint as host of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC came to an end in 1972 and her stint as the host of the Tournament of Roses Parade on NBC came to an end in 1975. In 1983 Betty White started playing the recurring role of Ellen Harper Jackson (a role she had originated on The Carol Burnett Show). It was in 1985 that she began playing one of her most famous roles, that of feather-brained Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls. She would also play the role in guest appearances on Empty Nest. She guest starred on the shows Best of the West; Love Sidney; Fame; Hotel; St. Elsewhere; The Love Boat; D. C. Follies; Matlock; Santa Barbara; Days of Our Lives; and Carol & Company. Betty White hosted the game show Just Men! and continued to appear frequently on game shows, including The $25,000 Pyramid, Password Plus, Body Language, Family Feud, Wheel of Fortune, The New Hollywood Squares, and others. Betty White continued to appear as Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls into the early Nineties. She also guest starred as Rose on Empty Nest and Nurses. She starred as Rose on the short-lived sequel series to The Golden Girls, The Golden Palace. She played the recurring role of Sylvia Schmidt on Bob Newhart's short-lived sitcom Bob. She was a regular on the short-lived shows Maybe This Time and Ladies Man. She guest starred on the shows Diagnosis Murder, The Naked Truth, The John Laroquette Show, Suddenly Susan, L.A. Doctors, Hercules, and Ally McBeal. She provided voices for the animated series The Lionhearts and The Wild Thornberrys. Betty White appeared in the movies Hard Rain (1998), Holy Man (1998), Lake Placid (1999), and The Story of Us (1999). She provided the voice of Round in the movie Whispers: An Elephant Tale (2000).In the Naughts Betty White had a recurring role on Boston Legal. She appeared on the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. She was a regular voice on the animated show Pound Puppies. In 2010 she began her stint as Elka Ostrovsky on Hot in Cleveland. She guest starred on the shows The Ellen Show; Teacher's Pet; Yes, Dear; Providence; That '70s Show; I'm With Her; The Practice; Everwood; My Wife and Kids; Malcolm in the Middle; Complete Savages; Joey; Ugly Betty; The Middle; Glenn Martin DDS; My Name is Earl; 30 Rock; and Community.

She appeared in the movies Bringing Down the House (2003), The Third Wish (2005), Love N' Dancing (2009), The Proposal (2009), and You Again (2010). During the Teens Betty White continued to appear as Elka Ostrovsky on Hot in Cleveland. She was the host, and producer of Betty White's Off Their Rockers. She guest starred on the shows The Client List, Save Me, The Soul Man, Crowded, Bones, Young & Hungry, and Fireside Chat with Esther. Betty White appeared in the TV movie The Lost Valentine. She was a guest voice on the animated series Spongebob Squarepants. She was a voice in the animated movies The Lorax (2012), Toy Story 4 (2019), and Trouble (2019).There may have been no celebrity as beloved as Betty White. As I said, I have certainly never seen as large an outpouring of grief for any single person as I have Betty. Much of it probably has to do with the length of her career. She first appeared on television in 1939. Her last appearance on television was last year. In between she appeared in numerous television shows. Betty White never had to make a comeback, because there was never a point in her career where she was not popular, never a point in her career where she was not relevant. She was always working and she never retired.Of course, Betty White was able to work so long and so frequently because she was such an enormous talent. Her comic timing was perfect and she could improvize lines on the spot. No one could be as funny as Betty White. What is more, she was very adaptable. This can be seen in the roles she played in her various television shows over the years: the mischievous Elizabeth from Life with Elizabeth, the daydreamy Vicki Angel, the man-hungry Sue Ann Nivens, the scatterbrained Rose Nylund, and the caustic Elka Ostrovsky. All of these characters were different, and yet they were all funny. Her roles in movies were varied as well.  In Bringing Down the House she played a character as far removed from her other characters as the character was from Betty White herself, an openly racist neighbour. In The Proposal she played the eccentric grandmother of lead character Andrew (Ryan Reynolds). I don't think Betty White ever quite got credit for her talent as an actress. She could certainly play a wide range of characters. While the length of Betty White's career and her overwhelming talent are often acknowledged, I don't think her status as a television pioneer is acknowledged often enough. She produced her own show, Life with Elizabeth, at a time when few women worked behind the camera in television. While she was not the first woman to star in a sitcom (after all, I Love Lucy pre-dates by two years), she was one of the earliest to do so. She hosted such variety shows as Hollywood on Television and The Betty White Show at a time when most hosts were men. What is more, she had creative control on The Betty White Show. When she hosted Just Men!, she was the only female game show host on the air. When it came to being a television pioneer, perhaps only Lucille Ball rivalled Betty White as a trailblazer.While Betty White had a long career, while she had great talent, and while she was a true pioneer, I think the reason she was so beloved and the reason we are all mourning her so is that she was the rarest of people, a genuinely good person. Throughout her career, one realized that Betty White cared about both her fellow human beings and her fellow living things. Among the many tributes to Betty White following her death is s tweet in which an individual explains how his boyfriend was a flight attendant flying from New York City to Los Angeles. While on the flight a passenger offered to help him serving the other passengers. The passenger took the coffee pot and proceeded to fill the cups of the other passengers. That passenger was Betty White. Todd Milliner, an executive producer on Hot in Cleveland, wrote in a long tribute to Betty, \"We honour her because she was so full of kindness — kindness to people, kindness to animals and kindness to the world. That’s pretty rare right now.\" While one hears many horror stories about stars on the sets of movies and TV shows, one never heard a complaint about Betty White. It is a mark of Betty White's kindness and consideration for others that 10 days  before her death, she recorded a tribute to her fans to be unveiled on her 100th birthday.While Betty White was always kind and considerate, she was no pushover. She was not afraid to stand up for what she believed in. During World War II, she served in the Women's Voluntary Services. When Betty was starring in her talk/variety show The Betty White Show in the mid-Fifties, she hired what may have been the first female director of a variety show in American television. On that same show she had African American tap dancer Arthur Duncan as a regular cast member. When NBC affiliates in the South complained and threatened to drop the show if they did not get rid of Mr. Duncan, Betty White simply replied, \"I'm sorry. Live with it.\" She then gave Arthur Duncan even more air time. Arthur Duncan credited Betty White with his big break. Of course, Betty White was well known as an animal welfare advocate. Among the groups she worked with regards to animal welfare were the Los Angeles Zoo Commission, The Morris Animal Foundation, African Wildlife Foundation, and Actors and Others for Animals. She supported LGBTQ rights at a time when it was not fashionable to do so. Of course, as much as we loved Betty White, the love of her life was third husband Allen Ludden. The two had met on the game show Password. She never remarried after his untimely death in 1981 from stomach cancer. When asked by Larry King in an interview why she never remarried, she simply replied, \"Once you've had the best, who needs the rest?\" According to Vicki Lawrence, she was told by Carol Burnett that Betty's assistant told her that Betty's last word was, \"Allen.\" Betty White lived a long life and achieved things most of us can only dream of. She will never be forgotten. And if one believes in an afterlife, one has to believe that she has been reunited with her beloved Allen Ludden. If we are mourning so much for Betty White, it is largely for ourselves. With her wit, humour, graciousness, and kindness, Betty White brought light into a world that sorely needed it, and we loved her for it. Without Betty White, some of that light is gone, and we cannot help but miss her. As far as the world is concerned, at 99 years old Betty White died all too soon."},
{"title": "Announcing the 8th Annual Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon", "date": "Sunday, January 2, 2022", "text": "I am announcing A Shroud of Thoughts' eighth annual \"Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon\". The first seven years were fairly successful, so I am looking forward to another year's worth of good blog posts. For those unfamiliar with the Favourite TV Show Episode Blogathon, it is a blogathon in which bloggers write entries about their favourite episodes of their favourite classic television shows. This year it will take place on March 18th, 19th, and 20th 2022.Here are the ground rules:1. Posts in the blogathon must be about an episode from a scripted drama. Episodes of reality shows, talk shows, game shows, and variety shows are ineligible. That having been said, posts can be on episodes from any genre of scripted dramas: animated shows, anthology shows, detective shows, police procedurals, science fiction shows, situation comedies, and so on. I also have to say that episodes can be from scripted dramas that aired at any time of day. They don't have to be from prime time alone. If one wanted to write about his or her favourite episode from his or her favourite Saturday morning cartoon or daytime soap opera, one could.2. Because this blogathon is dedicated to classic television and I think a classic is something that must have stood the test of time, episodes must be from shows that are at least 25 years old. That means one cannot write posts on episodes from shows that debuted after 1997 (nothing from CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, let alone Blackish). Now here I want to point out that the episode itself does not have to be 25 years old, only the show on which it aired. Law & Order debuted in 1990 and ran until 2010, so that its final season aired after 1997. Because Law & Order is over 25 years old, however, one could still write about an episode that aired in the 2009-2010 season.3. Given my love of British television, it should come as no surprise that posts do not have to be about episodes from American shows alone. Posts can be about episodes from any show from any country as long as the show is a scripted drama and debuted over 25 years ago. If you want to write about your favourite episode of The Saint, The Little Hobo, Jaianto Robo, or Escrava Isaura, you can.4.  I am asking that there please be no duplicates. That having been said, if someone has already chosen to cover \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" from The Twilight Zone, someone else could still write about another Twilight Zone episode.5. In keeping with ground rule no. 4, I am asking that if you participated in the past years' blogathons that you write about a different episode from what you did the past years. That having been said, you could write about an episode from the same show.  If you wrote about the Star Trek episode \"Amok Time\" last year, then you could write about the Star Trek episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\" this year.6. I am not going to schedule days for individual posts. All I ask is that the posts be made on or between March 18, March 19, or March 20 2022.7. On March 18 I will set up the page for the blogathon. I ask that you link your posts to that page. If you want you can use one of the graphics below or make your own!If you want to participate in the Favourite Television Show Episode Blogathon, you can simply comment below or you can get a hold of me either on Twitter at mercurie80 or at my email:  mercurie80 at gmail.com.Below is a roster of participants and the topics they are covering.

{"title": "2021 Reaches Its End", "date": "Friday, December 31, 2021", "text": "I think I can speak for most people when I say that 2021 was not a good year. Like the year before it, it was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The creation of vaccines gave some hope, and for a time businesses and theatres reopened. Unfortunately, the Omicron variant emerged and seems to have put us right back where we started. In New York City, Broadway theatres are closed again. In many places restaurants are closing again. As we enter 2022, it sometimes seems like the pandemic will never end.Personally, I will always remember 2021 as a  year when some of my friends died. I had known Kelly Abbass since the days of MySpace. In August 2018 (have I mentioned how much I hate that month in that year) she was diagnosed with brain cancer. Sadly, this year she lost her battle with the disease. Kelly was an artistic model and she also sang. While she was an artistic model, she was at heart a sweet, small town, Canadian girl. She never missed wishing me a happy birthday, even as she was suffering from cancer. Every year she would post about her husband Steve's birthday and I would tell her to wish him a happy birthday and she said she would. She was perhaps the only person I know who was as big a Cheap Trick fan as I am. Fellow blogger Steve Bailey of the blog Movie Movie Blog Blog died unexpectedly this year. This took me by surprise, as Steve was only a little older than me, even though he was not in good health. Steve had a wonderful, if twisted, sense of humour and he may well have been the biggest Jane Russell fan I knew. He was also a huge Beatles fan. He was a very active blogger and he participated in many blogathons. He was also a long time member of TCMParty.Another long time friend who died this year was Channing Thomson. Channing was the king of movie posters and related memorabilia. Indeed, he had been in the movie poster business since 1985. I know only a few people who know more about classic film than Channing did. He was also gifted with a great sense of humour. He was one of the early members of TCMParty as well.2021 also saw the deaths of many beloved celebrities. Indeed, it seems to have saved the most beloved celebrity for last. Television pioneer and legend Betty White died today at the age of 99. Like many her has shook me. I never met Betty, but I remember her from my earliest days and I always enjoyed seeing her on television and film. Betty White was a true pioneer. At age 18 she appeared on television for the first time, at which point the medium was still experimental. She produced her sitcom Life with Elizabeth, making her one of the few women at the time in total creative control of a TV show. Like nearly everyone, I adored Betty White and it hurts to know she didn't live to see her 100th birthday. I will post a eulogy for her January 3.Sadly, this month also saw the death of Michael Nesmith, composer, singer, guitarist, movie producer, and Monkee. Anyone who has read this blog knows how much I love The Monkees, and Michael Nesmith was my favourite. I will freely admit that I grieved over Michael Nesmith more than any other celebrity save for John Lennon, George Harrison, and, for obvious reasons, my beloved Vanessa. I never met him, but he was part of my life since my early childhood. I loved his work with The Monkees and his solo work.The year would see the deaths of other celebrities I love. Jane Powell was always one of my favourite actresses and she starred in some of my favourite movies: Royal Wedding (1951) and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954). In addition to Betty White, we lost two other members of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Ed Asner played Lou Grant on the show, but he played so many other roles and did them all well. Cloris Leachman had a long career before The Mary Tyler Moore Show and a long career afterwards. She was truly a force to be reckoned with when it came to acting. Another great actress to die this year was Jessica Walter. There seemed to be no role she couldn't play. Of course, I am a fan of The Andy Griffith Show, so I was sad when I heard of Betty Lynn's death. She was Barney Fife's one true love, Thelma Lou, and no one could have played her better. Aside from Michael Nesmith, two other music artists close to my heart died this year. Charlie Watts was The Rolling Stones' drummer and a large part of why the band was so great. Don Everly was one half of The Everly Brothers, whose music created entire subgenres of rock. Mary Wilson was always my favourite of The Supremes, and the only one to stay with the group form its beginnings to their break-up in 1977. Many beloved actors died this year. This is a short list of those who died. I apologize for leaving out anyone's favourites, but so many died this year it was hard to keep track. Among those who died were Barbara Shelley, Deezer D, Cicely Tyson, Hal Holbrook, Christopher Plummer, Yaphet Kotto, George Segal, Gavin MacLeod, Clarence Williams III, Ned Beatty, Frank Bonner, Jane Withers, Markie Post, Pat Hitchcock, Sonny Chiba, Michael Constantine, Willie Garson, Tommy Kirk, Peter Scolari, Dean Stockwell, Arlene Dahl, Eddie Mekka, and Cara Williams. The music world also saw several losses, including Michael Stanley, Jim Steinman, Lloyd Price, ZZ Top bassist Dusty Hill, Moody Blues drummer Graeme Edge, and composer Stephen Sondheim. Among the others who died were comic book writer Dwayne McDuffie, magician Mark Wilson, children's writer Beverly Cleary, and novelist Anne Rice.Streaming continued to be major news in 2021, although it is still not the dominant way of watching television. According to Nielsen, streaming platforms accounted for 28% of all television viewing. Most of my viewing tends to be older TV shows and movies, but I caught some of the streaming original shows this year. Doom Patrol is still my favourite streaming show and I watched its third season. I watched WandaVision and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is one of the best explorations of grief I have ever seen. I also watched The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and enjoyed it. I also enjoyed Only Murders in the Building, which was a lot of fun.I can't say much about the movies released this year, as I haven't seen any. I have avoided the theatres this year and I forget to watch them on streaming. I want to see Dune and Passing. Some time I guess I will have to get caught up on them.Anyhow, I hope that 2022 is a much better year. I hope that we can put this pandemic behind us and that everyone can enjoy peace and joy in the coming year. 2021 has been a rough year for all of us, and I think all of us need a break."},

My suggestions as to the films you absolutely do not want to miss are as follows: Rope (1948), the Hitchcock movie based on the 1929 play of the same time, which was inspired by the murder of Bobby Franks in 1924 by Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb in Chicago; The Hitch-Hiker (1954), Ida Lupino's classic noir based on spree killer Billy Cook; In Cold Blood (1967), based on Truman Capote's non-fiction novel, which was in turn based on the murders of four members of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas in 1959; The French Connection (1971), which was inspired by the real-life pursuit of French heroin smuggler Alain Charnier; Dog Day Afternoon (1975), which was based on the August 22 1972 robbery of the Chase Manhattan branch in Brooklyn; and Double Indemnity (1944), the classic noir based on James M. Cain's novel of the same name, which was in turn inspired by a 1927 murder case in Queens, New York in which Ruth Snyder persuaded her boyfriend Judd Gray to kill her husband.

{"title": "Wanda Young of The Marvelettes Passes On", "date": "Wednesday, December 29, 2021", "text": "Wanda Young, who sang with the girl group The Marvelettes, died on December 19 2021 at the age  of 78. The cause was complications of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Wanda Young was born on August 9 1943 in Inkster, Michigan. She attended Inkster High School. She had planned to become a nurse, but then her classmate Georgia Dobbins left the local girl group The Marvels. Wanda Young was asked to audition and as a result took Miss Dobbins's place in the group. It was not long after Motown signed The Marvels that they were renamed The Marvelettes.The Marvelettes gave Motown their first no. 1 hit when \"Please Mr. Postman\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961. The Marvelettes would follow the success of \"Please Mr. Postman\" with such hits as \"Playboy,\" \"Beechwood 4-5789,\" \"Too Many Fish in the Sea,\" and \"I'll Keep Holding On.\" Wanda Young took over lead vocals from Gladys Horton in 1965 and sang lead on their hits \"Don't Mess with Bill,\" \"The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game, and \"My Baby Must Be a Magician.\" As the Sixties progressed, The Marvelettes would have fewer and fewer hits. The group disbanded in 1970. Wanda Young then recorded a solo album produced by Smokey Robinson which Motown released as The Return of The Marvelettes, even though no other Marvelettes appeared on the album.It was in 1989 that Gladys Horton was offered a contract by Motorcity Records to record a new album as The Marvelettes. Wanda Young was the only Marvelette that Miss Horton interested in the project. the album, The Marvelettes Now!, featured both Gladys Horton and Wanda Young. Wanda Young was a very talented singer. No less than Smokey Robinson wrote of her in his liner notes for The Marvelettes' compilation album Deliver: the Singles (1961-1971), \"“Wanda had this little voice that was sexy to me, a little country kind of voice...I knew if I could get a song to her, it would be a smash.\" Miss Young's vocals were certainly bewitching and enriched The Marvelettes' records. While they may not be the be the best known girl group today, they remain one of the best."},
{"title": "Movies to Watch Between Christmas Day and New Year's Day", "date": "Tuesday, December 28, 2021", "text": "Ocean's 11 planning a rather unique New Year's Eve Party.In some ways the week between Christmas Day and New Year's Day is a strange. In some ways it is as if society has stopped celebrating Christmas, even though in many Christian denominations Christmastide runs from December 25 to January 5. Businesses and even some private individuals  take down their decorations. Radio stations stop playing Christmas music. Television stations stop showing Christmas fare. At the same time it is as if Christmas has not totally gone away. Many people will keep their decorations up until New Year's Day. Cities will keep their decorations up until New Year's Day as well. And one will still see the stray Christmas themed commercial on television (usually car commercials). Simply because Christmas Day has passed doesn't mean one can no longer watch festive movies. In fact, there are some movies that in many ways are better suited to watching after Christmas Day than they are before. Here is a short list of movies one can watch following Christmas Day but before or including New Year's Day.These movies generally fall into one of two categories. One are movies that begin shortly before Christmas and last until New Year's. The other are movies that either take place on New Year's or climax on New Year's. Ether way, New Year's and sometimes the days between Christmas Day and New Year's play a significant role in each of them.After the Thin Man (1936): The Thin Man (1934) takes place right at Christmas. After the Thin Man takes place right after They Thin Man. so it begins with Nick and Nora returning from at the end of the first movie on New Year's Eve to find an unexpected New Year's party taking place in their home. While much of the plot takes place after New Year's Day, the party that opens the film makes it perfect viewing shortly before or on New Year's. The Apartment (1960): The Apartment is considered by many (including myself) to be a Christmas movie. At the same time, it is also a New Year's Eve movie and suitable for viewing any time before Christmas up to New Year's Day. Indeed, The Apartment begins on November 1 and ends with New Year's Eve, with Christmas playing a significant role in the plot. Indeed, it might well have the most famous climax at New Year's eve ever. While my favourite time to watch The Apartment is New Year's Eve, it makes for great viewing any time before or after Christmas Day.Bachelor Mother (1939): Many people think of Bachelor Mother as a Christmas movie, but it might be more accurate to describe it as a New Yea's movie. It begins on Christmas Eve, when Polly Parrish's (Ginger Rogers) seasonal employment at the department store John B. Merlin and Son, and ends on New Year's Day. Bachelor Mother literally then takes place in the week between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day, which might just make it the perfect movie for this time of year.Diner (1982): Diner is set in 1959 and takes place from the night of Christmas Day to New Year's Day. Like Bachelor Mother, it is then a perfect movie for this time of year. Holiday Affair (1949): Holiday Affair is often counted as a Christmas movie, but it takes place shortly before Christmas and ends on New Year's Eve. A good deal of the plot is dedicated to Christmas Day. Like The Apartment, then, it is not only a perfect movie for Christmas viewing, but New Year's Viewing as well. Holiday Inn (1942): Holiday Inn takes place over a year and devotes several holidays, including New Year's Eve. It even includes a song dedicated to New Year's, \"Let's Start the New Year Right.\" Wh8le often thought of as a Christmas movie, this makes Holiday Inn the perfect movie for New Year's viewing.Ocean's 11 (1960): Ocean's 11 could well be the New Year's Eve movie. After all, the movie centres on a group of World War II veterans from the 82nd Airborne, who plan to rob five casinos in Las Vegas at the same time on New Year's Eve. The bulk of the plot then takes place in the days leading up to New Year's Eve and the night itself.The Poseidon Adventure (1972): The Poseidon Adventure largely takes place on New Year's Eve, with the S.S. Poseidon hit by a tsunami and overturned even as its New Year's celebrations are taking place. Like Ocean's 11, then, this makes it very much a New Year's movie.Sunset Boulevard (1950): Sunset Boulevard unfolds over a period of six months, but its memorable climax takes place on New Year's Eve. Of course, it's not a very happy New Year's Eve for anyone involved....When Harry Met Sally (1989): When Harry Met Sally takes place over literally years, but its climax takes place on New Year's Eve. In fact, aside from The Apartment, it might have the most famous New Year's Eve climax of all time."},
{"title": "Sally Ann Howes Passes On", "date": "Monday, December 27, 2021", "text": "Sally Ann Howes, who appeared in the movies Dead of Night (1945) and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1969), died on December 19 2021 at the age of 91. Sally Ann Howes was born on July 20 1930 in St. John's Wood, London. She was the daughter of comedian Bobby Howes and actress Patricia Malone. During World War II her family moved to their house in Essendon, Hertfordshire. She appeared in school plays before making her film debut in Thursday Child (1943) as a young girl. She appeared in the film The Halfway House (1944) before appearing as Sally O'Hara as a girl attending a Christmas party that takes a turn for the macabre in Dead of Night (1945). For the remainder Sally Ann Howes appeared in such movies as Pink Sting and Sealing Wax (1945), The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (1947), Anna Karenina (1948), My Sister and I (1948), The History of Mr. Polly (1949), Fools Rush In (1949), and Stop Press Girl (1949). She made her television debut in a production of Cinderella in 1950. She made her stage debut in Caprice in Glasgow in the same year.In the Fifties Miss Howes appeared in the movies Honeymoon Deferred (1951) and The Admirable Crichton (1957). She appeared on the West End in such productions as Paint Your Wagon and A Hatful of Rain. She appeared on Broadway in My Fair Lady. She appeared on television in such productions as The Golden Year, Paint Your Wagon, and The Gift of the Magi. She guest starred on the shows Kaleidoscope, Buick-Electra Playhouse, and Sunday Showcase. In the Sixties Sally Ann Howes appeared in the movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968). She guest starred on the shows Play of the Week, The United States Steel Hour, Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, Run for Your Life, Journey Into Fear, Mission: Impossible, and Bracken's World. She appeared on stage in such productions as Brigadoon at New York City Center Light Opera Company, My Fair Lady at the Melody Top Theatre in Chicago, and Camelot at the Muny in St. Louis.In the Seventies Sally Ann Howes guest starred on the shows The Virginian and Marcus Welby, M.D. She appeared in the TV movie The Hound of the Baskervilles. She appeared in the movie Death Ship (1980). For the remainder of her career Sally Ann Howes appeared almost exclusively on stage, in such productions as The Sound of Music at the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera in 1972, a British tour of The King and I in 1973, Hamlet at the Gardner Centre Theatre in Brighton in 1983, A Little Night Music at the Lincoln Center in 1992, and an American tour of My Fair Lady in 2008. She only appeared on television two more times, once when Live from Lincoln Center broadcast A Little Night Music in 1990 and two guest appearance on Secrets in 1992. I have to think the majority of people will remember Sally Ann Howes as Truly Scrumptious in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and with her beautiful voice she was certainly suited to the role. That having been said, Miss Howes had a long career on stage and appeared in movies other than Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. In fact, I don't think I'm alone when my favourite role she played was Sally in Dead of Night. As a young teenager she gave a remarkable performance. She also gave solid performances on her various guest appearances on TV shows. For instance, on Mission: Impossible she played an agent for the Impossible Missions Force who must pose as a baroness and Phelps's wife. She was a remarkable actress with a good deal of talent."},

{"title": "Hallmark Hall of Fame and Christmas", "date": "Friday, December 24, 2021", "text": "Today the phrase \"Hallmark movie\" carries a negative connotation. It brings to mind poorly made romances aired on the Hallmark Channel, largely written according to a formula. This was not always the case. In fact, for much of its history Hallmark was known for the highest quality in television. Hallmark Hall of Fame is the longest running anthology series in the history of American television. Over the years it has won several awards, including Emmys, DGA Awards, Humanitas Awards, Peabodys, and WGA Awards. It was 70 years ago today that the very first Hallmark Hall of Fame episode (or \"presentation,\" as Hallmark likes to call them) aired. It was the first of many Christmas presentations that would air on Hallmark Hall of Fame.Hallmark Cards was hardly new to broadcasting when Hallmark Hall of Fame debuted. On radio Hallmark Cards had sponsored Radio Reader's Digest and later Hallmark Playhouse. It was with the radio show Hallmark Playhouse that Hallmark established their reputation for quality programming. It was in 1951 that NBC commissioned the first opera written specifically for television, Amahl and the Night Visitors. To sponsor the opera, NBC approached Hallmark Cards. Today it must seem incredulous that NBC would have approached the greeting card company about sponsoring Amahl and the Night Visitors. After all, it was set to air on Christmas Eve, after most people have bought their Christmas cards for the season. J. C. Hall, the head of Hallmark Cards, ultimately decided to go ahead with the special as a \"thank you\" for everyone who had bought Hallmark cards that Christmas season. Amahl and the Night Visitors aired to great acclaim. Even viewers were pleased with the opera, sending both letters and telegrams to Hallmark thanking them for it.Amahl and the Night Visitors centred on Amahl, a young disabled boy known for telling tall tales. He encounters the Three Kings on their way to visit the baby Jesus, and his mother invites them into rest form their long journey. The success of Amahl and the Night Visitors would result in it being restaged several times over the years on Hallmark Hall of Fame. The December 19 1954 version of Amahl and the Night Visitors would be the first to air in colour. Amahl and the Night Visitors was the first episode of what was then called Hallmark Television Playhouse. It was in 1953 that it was renamed \"Hallmark Hall of Fame.\" Amahl and the Night Visitors was also the first many Hallmark Hall of Fame presentations with a Christmas theme. On December 21 1952, Hallmark Television Playhouse aired The Small One, a Christmas story narrated by Kate Smith about an unwanted donkey. On December 15 1957 Hallmark Hall of Fame aired a production of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. While Hallmark Hall of Fame aired several Christmas themed episodes in the Fifties (a good number of which were new versions of Amahl and the Night Visitors), Christmas themed presentations became rarer in the Sixties. Much of this may have been due to when the series aired. For much of its history, Hallmark Hall of Fame aired only a few times each year, so that there were times it did not air in December. The first Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation of the Sixties with a Christmas theme would be A Cry of Angels, which aired on December 15 1963. It was about the writing of Handel's The Messiah.In the years following A Cry of Angels, Hallmark Hall of Fame once more aired Amahl and the Night Visitors. It was on December 6 1969 that one of the anthology show's best known productions was aired. The Littlest Angel was based on  Charles Tazewell's children's book of the same name. It centred on a young boy who dies and goes to Heaven, only to have difficulty adjusting to life there. It is when the birth of Jesus was announced that the angels prepare their best gifts for him, including the young boy. The Littlest Angel proved to be very popular, and it as repeated in 1970 and 1971.In 1972 Hallmark Hall of Fame aired a production of The Man Who Came to Dinner. In 1977 Hallmark Hall of Fame aired Have I Got a Christmas for You. The movie centred on a Jewish community who take the place of Christians at their jobs so the Christians can enjoy Christmas. The following year Hallmark Hall of Fame's Christmas presentation was Stubby Pringle's Christmas. Set in the Old West, Stubby Pringle's Christmas centred on a lonely cowboy who spends Christmas with a homesteader, her ailing husband, and their children.The Eighties saw Hallmark Hall of Fame air no presentations with a Christmas theme. Much of this was probably do with the fact that by the Eighties Hallmark Hall of Fame could have as few as two episodes per season to as many as four. There were times when it did not air in the month of December. It would not be until December 4 1994 that Hallmark Hall of Fame aired an episode that even touched upon Christmas. That night Hallmark's adaption of The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy aired. Like the novel, the Hallmark adaptation of The Return of the Native takes place over a year and a day. Part of its plot then deals with the Christmas season.It was the following season, on December 10 1995, that Hallmark Hall of Fame aired its first presentation with a Christmas theme in years. Season of Hope centred on a family who experiences a crisis at the holiday season after their lemon grove has become diseased. Hallmark Hall of Fame would not have another Christmas themed episode until A Season of Miracles aired on December 12 1999. A Season of Miracles centred on a woman who has to take custody of her niece and nephew after their mother overdoses on drugs and the state threatens to put them in a foster home. She arrives in the small town of Bethlehem, Rhode Island at Christmas. It would be three years before Hallmark Hall of Fame aired its next Christmas themed presentation. Fallen Angel centred on a successful lawyer who returns to Maine at Christmastime to settle his father' estate. First airing on November 26 2003, it was repeated on December 19 2004. In 2005 Hallmark Hall of Fame aired Silver Bells, which centred on a family that raises Christmas trees. When they go to New York City to sell them, the son runs away to pursue his passion in life, photography. It would be another three years before Hallmark Hall of Fame's next Christmas presentation, A Dog Named Christmas. The film centred on a young boy with a learning disability who bonds with a dog in the two weeks before Christmas. November Christmas, which aired in 2010, dealt with a young girl with a terminal disease whose family celebrates holidays early so she can experience them one last time.Hallmark Hall of Fame spent its first few decades on NBC. The series would then move to CBS and then briefly to PBS before airing on ABC. It was in 2014 that it was announced that Hallmark Hall of Fame would air exclusively on the Hallmark Channel. Regardless in the Teens Hallmark Hall of Fame continued to air Christmas themed episodes, including Christmas with Holly (2012), Christmas in Conway (2013), One Christmas Eve (2014), Just in Time for Christmas (2015), A Heavenly Christmas (2016), The Christmas Train (2017), Christmas Everlasting (2018), and A Christmas Love Story (2019). Sadly, many of these movies differed very little from the Hallmark Channel's movies, so that there was very little to set them apart as Hallmark Hall of Fame presentations. Fortunately, many of Hallmark Hall of Fame's older Christmas presentations are available on DVD, and some even air on the Hallmark Channel some holiday seasons. Both A Season of Miracles and A Dog Named Christmas have popped upon the channel from time to time. And while the episodes of Hallmark Hall of Fame would eventually deteriorate, for decades it was known for the high quality of its presentations. While Hallmark may be best known for poorly made Christmas romance movies today, there was a time it was known for Amahl and the Night Visitors, The Littlest Angel, and The Return of the Native."},
{"title": "The 70th Anniversary of Scrooge or A Christmas Carol (1951)", "date": "Thursday, December 23, 2021", "text": "Scrooge (1951), also known as A Christmas Carol (1951), is often regarded as one of the best adaptations  Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol. In fact, over the years it has become the favourite version of A Christmas Carol of many. As hard as it may be to believe today, this was not always the case. Scrooge (1951) premiered just a little over 70 years ago, on October 31 1951 in the United Kingdom.Scrooge was produced and directed by Brian Desmond Hurst, who had previously directed such films as The Tenth Man (1936) and Hungry Hill (1947). The screenplay was written by Noel Langley, who was one of the screenwriters who contributed to the classic The Wizard of Oz (1939). He also worked on such films as Babes in Arms (1939), Northwest Passage (1940), and Her Favourite Husband (1950). The title role was played by Alastair Sim. While he would later become known for the St. Trinian's films, Alastair Sim had played Inspector Cockrill in Green for Danger (1946), Felix H. Wilkinson in Hue and Cry (1947), and Commodore Gill in Hitchcock's Stage Fright (1950). In sharp contrast to MGM's lavish 1938 version of A Christmas Carol, the tone of Scrooge was closer to that of the novel. Quite simply, it was a very dark film. Regardless, it did well at the box office in Britain. Unfortunately, the fact that Scrooge was a very dark movie would work against it in the United States. It was slated for a run at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, but the theatre's management decided the film was too depressing. Retitled A Christmas Carol in the United States, it premiered in New York City on November 28 1951. The movie ultimately failed at the box office in America. It probably did not help that MGM's A Christmas Carol (1938) was still very popular in the United States and still the choice of many people with regards to their favourite adaptation of A Christmas Carol.What saved Scrooge in the United States was the relatively young medium of television. Under the title A Christmas Carol, Scrooge made its television debut on WOR-TV in New York City in 1954. Throughout the Fifties and Sixties, Scrooge would pop up on various local television stations throughout the United States. In the Seventies, many PBS stations began showing Scrooge. Over time, more and more Americans were exposed to Scrooge, and it became regarded as a holiday classic in the United States. Eventually, it would become regarded by many as the quintessential version of A Christmas Carol.That is not to say that Scrooge does not depart from the novel a good deal. The biggest difference between the two may be that a good deal of material is added in Scrooge dealing with his rise as a young businessman. An entirely new character, Mr. Jorkin (Jack Warner) was added to the film as the mentor to both young Scrooge (George Cole) and young Jacob Marley (Patrick Macnee, later of The Avengers). A more minor change is that Scrooge's fiancée, Belle, is renamed Alice in the movie. She portrayed in the present as working with the sick and homeless, whereas in the book she is married with children. Scrooge also expanded the role of Scrooge's charwoman, who had such a minor role in the novel that she is not given a name. In Scrooge she is named Mrs. Dilber (the name of the laundress in the novel) and she is given much more to do. While Scrooge does depart a great deal from the original source material, it is loyal to the tone of the novel in a way that many adaptations of A Christmas Carol are not. Quite simply, Scrooge is a ghost story, and it can at times be a bit frightening. It also does not shy away from the realities of Victorian London as portrayed in the novel. Charles Dickens largely wrote A Christmas Carol as a protest against the poverty that existed in 1840s London, particularly poverty where children were concerned. This theme is not lost in the movie Scrooge.Of course, much of what makes Scrooge such a good adaptation of A Christmas Carol is its cast. While Mr. Jorkin may have been a character who was original to the movie, he was wonderfully realized by Jack Warner, perhaps then best known for playing Joe Huggett in the Huggetts series of movies. Mr. Jorkin was about as far removed from Joe Huggett as one could get. Interestingly enough, Kathleen Harrison, who played the charwoman Mrs. Dilber, was also a veteran of the Huggetts movies, having played Ethel, Joe Huggett's wife. She does a wonderfully comic turn as Mrs. Dilber in Scrooge. Mervyn Johns may well have been the best Bob Cratchit to ever appear on screen. He even looks like the Bob Cratchit from the illustrations of Charles Dickens's novel in the Victorian Era.As great as the cast of Scrooge is, there can be no doubt that the star of the film is Alastair Sim as Ebeneezer Scrooge. Ebeneezer Scrooge's transformation from a curmudgeonly old skinflint to a generous man who loves Christmas comes slowly, and Alastair Sim does a wonderful job of playing out that transformation. Suitably bad tempered and cheap at the start of the film, Alastair Sim is positively giddy once he has shown the error of his ways. For many, Alsatair Sim remains their favourite Scrooge.Scrooge would not be the last time that Alastair Sim played Scrooge and Mervyn Jones played Bob Cratchit. Australian animation studio British animator Richard Williams produced and directed an animated version of A Christmas Carol in 1971. This version of A Christmas Carol, like Scrooge, was similarly dark. It would make its American television debut on ABC on December 21 1971. It was released theatrically and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1972. Upon its premiere in the United States it must have seemed unlikely to many that Scrooge would ever become a Christmas classic. After all, no less than Radio City Music Hall had rejected the film as too depressing. Through the miracle of television it eventually found its audience and eventually became regarded by many as the best version of A Christmas Carol. Today it is hard to conceive of a time when it wasn't regarded as a beloved holiday classic."},
{"title": "TCM Remembers 2021", "date": "Wednesday, December 22, 2021", "text": "I think I can speak for most Turner Classic Movies fans when I saw we simultaneously look forward to and dread TCM Remembers each year. We look forward to it because it is the best In Memoriam of beloved stars that any TV channel, network, or organization does. We dread it because we know that when we watch it there will be loads of tears. This year I imagine TCM fans cried a good deal, as an inordinately large number of beloved stars died this year. When I first saw TCM Remembers 2021 this past Saturday I managed to maintain my composure, only tearing up at such beloved stars as Pat Hitchcock, Betty Lynn, Willie Garson, Jessica Walter, Ed Asner, Dean Stockwell, and Norman Lloyd. I did not break down until they got to Michael Nesmith. If there is one thing I love as much as classic film, it is The Monkees. My tears only grew more when they got to Jane Powell, one of my all time favourite actresses. In fact, if I had done this year's TCM Remembers, it would have been either Jane Powell or Ed Asner who have gotten the end spot. I love Christopher Plummer, but Jane Powell and Ed Asner are, well, Jane Powell and Ed Asner. I do have to say I loved this year's choice of song. If it sounds familiar, it is because it is a cover of R.E.M.'s \"Shiny Happy People\" by Reuben and the Dark X AG.Anyway, for those of you who haven't seen it yet, get out the tissues, because here it is."},
{"title": "The 53rd Birthday of My Dearest Vanessa Marquez", "date": "Tuesday, December 21, 2021", "text": "Today my dearest Vanessa Marquez would have turned 53. She was born on December 21 1968 in Los Angeles County. Many will be familiar with Vanessa from her role as Ana Delgado in the classic film Stand and Deliver (1988) and Nurse Wendy Goldman on the TV series ER. She also appeared in such movies as Twenty Bucks (1993) and Father Hood (1993). She was a regular on the TV show Culture Clash and she guest starred on shows from Seinfeld to Nurses. She also appeared many times on stage, in such productions as Demon Wine, August 29, and Street of the Sun.While for many Vanessa was a talented and well-known actress, for me she was  both my dearest friend and a woman I adored. Like many I had first seen her in Stand and Deliver. I later remember watching the Nurses episode \"The One After the Earthquake\" and thinking the young guest star on the episode was remarkably pretty, only to learn later she had played Ana Delgado in one of my favourite movies, Stand and Deliver. Of course, that fall I began seeing Vanessa regularly as Wendy on ER. Wendy was (and still is) my favourite character on ER, and I even had a crush on her at the time. When Vanessa and I met as two of the original members of #TCMParty (the group of Turner Classic Movies fans who live tweet to movies on that channel), I knew exactly who she was, even if I was a bit doubtful at first that it was really her (I'd encountered people impersonating celebrities on Twitter before). I soon learned that not only was Vanessa very talented, but she was also entirely wonderful. She was sweet, thoughtful, warm, down-to-earth, intelligent, and funny. I also learned we had a good deal in common. Vanessa and I became friends, and we even grew close. Eventually we would be in touch nearly every single day, through social media, through texts, and through phone calls. Vanessa was my dearest friend and I loved her very, very much. If today is a bit bittersweet for me, that is the reason.I will freely admit that I thought (and still think) Vanessa was the most beautiful woman to ever live. I am sure that even now Vanessa would disagree. She once took this survey on Facebook, \"What Kind of Attractive Are You?\" and got the result, \"Adorable.\" She complained that she was tired of being cute. She wanted to be beautiful, gorgeous, glamorous, sexy, or hot. I told her that she was beautiful, gorgeous, glamorous, sexy, and hot. Vanessa still maintained she was only cute at best, but she accepted it when I told her that to me she was beautiful, gorgeous, glamorous, sexy, and hot. Over the past year I have bought slides of pictures of Vanessa taken at various events. I submit these as proof that Vanessa was far more than cute. She was absolutely gorgeous. I have to apologize for the quality of some of the pictures. I lack a proper slide scanner and so I had to use my smartphone and a lightbox. This first photo is one of my favourites of the ones I got this year. It is from the NBC All-Star Reception at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Pasadena on  January 9,1995.This is another photo from the NBC All-Star Reception at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena on January 9 1995.This may well be my absolute favourite of the slides I got, as I think Vanessa absolutely radiates Old Hollywood glamour. This is from the 27th NAACP Image Awards held at the Pasadena Civic Centre on April 6 1996. ER had been nominated for several awards.This picture is from the Memory Walk to benefit Alzheimer's disease at the Los Angeles Zoo on October 7 1995. That's fellow ER cast member Lily Mariye in the background.This photo is from An Evening at the Net at the UCLA Tennis Center on July 31 1995. An Evening at the Net that year was a benefit for the California State Summer School for the Arts.This is a picture from the Red Cross Spirit Awards held at Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel on March 30 1996.This photo is from the premiere of the movie Desperado (1995) at Manns National Theatre in Westwood, California.Embed from Getty ImagesFor those of you who wanted to see all of Vanessa's outfit from the Desperado premiere, I found it on Getty Images, where for some odd reason they didn't note that it was Vanessa Marquez.Of course, here I have to stress that Vanessa's beauty was not merely skin deep. She wasn't just physically beautiful, but she was an entirely wonderful person. As our mutual friend Paula Guthat said of Vanessa, \"She's lovely through and through.\" Whenever one of her friends was sick or feeling down, Vanessa was always the first to comfort them. She had this remarkable ability to remember little things about people, down to the smallest detail. She was always the first to take up for one of her friends whenever one of them was attacked. Even when she was feeling poorly (which, given her health, could be often), she always maintained a cheery disposition. Vanessa had a great sense of humour and she was very intelligent. She was much, much more than a pretty face.If I was in love with Vanessa, it was not because she was beautiful, but because she was an entirely wonderful person. She worried about me when I was sick. She had this incredible knack for cheering me up whenever I felt my worst. She was happy for me when something good happened to me and sad when something bad happened to me. If today is a bittersweet day for me, it is because it is a happy day because the one person I love more than any other was born, yet it is a sad day because she is no longer with us. I do hope that Vanessa has a happy birthday in the hereafter, and that she realizes just how very loved she is."},
{"title": "The British Tradition of the Christmas Number One", "date": "Monday, December 20, 2021", "text": "In the United Kingdom there is no more prestigious time to have a number one song than the week in which Christmas Day falls. During most years there is usually intense competition among music artists to have the number one single on Christmas Day, better known simply as the \"Christmas number one.\" The sometimes intense scrutiny paid to the contest for the Christmas number one may seem to have existed since the beginning of the UK singles chart, but that actually isn't the case. The official UK Singles Chart was started in 1952, when it was published in The New Music Express (NME). There were certainly number one singles in the week during Christmas from the earliest days, but it does not seem that any more attention was paid to them than any other time of year. In fact, if my research is correct, the phrase \"Christmas number one\" with reference to the race for the number one single on Christmas Day did not appear in print until 1973. That year is significant, as two popular bands each released Christmas themed singles. Slade released  \"Merry Xmas Everybody,\" while Wizzard released  \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday.\" A rather intense competition developed between the two singles as to which would be the number one single on Christmas Day. In the end, Slade won with \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" going to number one. It has since become a British Christmas standard. As to Wizzard's \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday,\" it peaked at number four.While it may be a bit anachronistic to speak of Christmas number ones before 1973, the first single to be number one on Christmas Day on the official UK singles chart was also the first single to be number one on the chart, \"Here in My Heart\" by Al Martino. It was at number one when the chart was started on November 14 1952. It was still at number one during the week of Christmas. As to what was the first actual Christmas song to be number one during the week of Christmas, that would be \"Christmas Alphabet\" by Dickie Valentine in 1955. As to the record for the most number one singles during the week of Christmas, that  belongs to The Beatles. They hit number one during the week of Christmas with four singles: \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" in 1963, \"I Feel Fine\" in 1964, \"Day Tripper\"/\"We Can Work It Out\" (a double A-side) in 1965, and \"Hello Goodbye\" in 1967. Although it might seem odd, the majority of Christmas number ones have not been songs about Christmas. After Christmas themed Christmas number ones in both 1973 (\"Merry Xmas Everybody\" by Slade) and 1974 (\"Lonely This Christmas\" by Mud), \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen was the Christmas number one for 1975. \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\"  by Pink Floyd, \"Don't You Want Me\" by The Human League, \"Reet Petite\" by Jackie Wilson, and even \"Killing in the Name\" by Rage Against the Machine have all been Christmas number ones. Given little attention was paid to what singles were number one during the week of Christmas prior to 1973, it should come as no surprise that it would be some time before the Christmas number one would be announced on Christmas Day. It was not until 1994 that the Christmas number one was actually announced on Christmas itself.Since 1973 the annual attention paid to the race for the Christmas number one has been very much a part of British culture, so much so that the race for the Christmas number one formed one of the subplots of the movie Love Actually (2003). In the movie washed up rocker Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) records a Christmas themed cover of The Troggs' \"Love is All Around\" (\"Christmas is All Around\") in hopes of a comeback. As it turns out, \"Christmas is All Around\" is in competition with a single by the boy band Blue, their single being considered the odds-on favourite.As to how having the number one single during Christmas became so significant in the United Kingdom, my guess it comes down to two things. The first is that Christmas remains the biggest holiday throughout the English speaking world, and this is no truer than anywhere than the United Kingdom. The second is that record sales in the United Kingdom increase to around 40%. The combination of the significance of Christmas and the increase in sales at Christmas both made having a number one single during the week of Christmas more prestigious than any other time of year. After nearly fifty years of intense scrutiny being paid to the race for the Christmas number one, there appears to be no sign that the British public will stop paying attention to the Christmas number one. The favourite for this year's Christmas number one is \"Sausage Rolls for Everyone\" by LadBaby. If he wins the race for the Christmas number one, he will be tied with The Beatles for the most number one singles during the week of Christmas. We'll have to wait until Christmas 2022 to see if he breaks The Beatles' record."},
{"title": "The 70th Anniversary of The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) ", "date": "Sunday, December 19, 2021", "text": "Despite the fact that it introduced the classic Christmas song \"Silver Bells,\" like many classic Christmas movies The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) was not released at Christmastime. Instead it was released on April 2 1951. That having been said, it has since become a favourite of many to watch at Christmastime. Given how well it captures the spirit of the holiday, this should come as no surprise.The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) was very loosely based on the short story \"The Lemon Drop Kid\" by Damon Runyon. The short story centred on the title character, a race track tout who cons a rich man out of $100 and then flees to settle down in a small town. It had been previously adapted as the movie The Lemon Drop Kid (1934), which was rather faithful to the short story. That having been said, about the only thing The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) has in common with the short story is that they are centred on a race track tout called the Lemon Drop Kid. In The Lemon Drop Kid (1951), Bob Hope plays the title character, who cons a woman into betting on a horse other than the odds-on favourite. As it turns out, the woman is the girl friend of gangster Moose Moran (Fred Clark), who demands the Lemon Drop Kid pay him the $10,000 his girlfriend lost on the bet. The Lemon Drop Kid then flees Florida for New York City in hopes of raising the money. It is December, so he concocts a scheme involving street corner Santas. The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) likely owed its existence to a previous Bob Hope movie inspired by a Damon Runyon short story. Sorrowful Jones (1949) was based on the Damon Runyon short story \"Little Miss Marker,\" which had previously been adapted as the Shirley Temple movie Little Miss Marker (1934). Sorrowful Jones did brisk business at the box office, so another Bob Hope movie based on a Damon Runyon short story probably seemed like a sure thing. Indeed, the same director, Sidney Lanfield, directed both.As to the casting of The Lemon Drop Kid (1951), Bob Hope insisted that Marilyn Maxwell be cast as his romantic interest, Brainey Baxter. At the time Marilyn Maxwell was far from being a household name. As might be expected, Paramount asked who she was. Bob Hope simply told the studio that he had worked with her in New York, and she was good. What Bob Hope did not tell Paramount is that he and Miss Maxwell were carrying on an affair. Of course, while Marilyn Maxwell might not have been particularly well known, The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) featured a slough of recognizable faces, including Fred Clark, Jane Darwell, Sid Melton, and Lloyd Nolan. Among these recognizable faces was the only actor who had appeared in 1934 version of The Lemon Drop Kid, William Frawley. Of course, today The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) may be best known as the film that introduced the Christmas standard \"Silver Bells.\" While Jay Livingston and Ray Evans had already written a number of hits, in 1950 their career was in such a lull that the two worried Paramount might release them from their contract. It was at this time that the studio asked the two to write a Christmas song. Jay Livingston and Ray Evan's stories about the inspiration behind \"Silver Bells\" differ. Jay Livingston said that the song was inspired by the bells used by Salvation Army Santas and others on New York City street corners during Christmastime. Ray Evans said it was inspired by a bell that sat on the desk he shared with Jay Livingston. Regardless, of its inspiration, the song started out as \"Tinkle Bells.\" The song's title changed immediately after Ray Evans's wife informed him that \"tinkle\" was a slang term for urination.Once The Lemon Drop Kid (1931) was completed, Bob Hope was not particularly happy with the finished product. Bob Hope asked gag writer Frank Tahslin (who had also been an animator at Warner Bros.) to rewrite a number of scenes. Frank Tashlin agreed provided he could direct the retakes. This did not sit well Sidney Lanfield, who would never work with Bob Hope again.Among the retakes directed by Frank Tashlin was the sequence involving \"Silver Bells.\" The original \"Silver Bells\" sequence as directed by Sidney Lanfield was simply the cast standing in an empty casino singing the song. Aside from Mr. Lanfield's reportedly uninspired staging of the song, Bob Hope may well have had another reason for wanting the \"Silver Bells\" sequence to stand out more. Bob Hope's friend and Road to... movie co-star Bing Crosby had recorded his own version of the song, that had been released in October 1950. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby had always had a friendly rivalry, so naturally Mr. Hope did not want to be shown up by Mr. Crosby. To this end Frank Tashlin moved the action of the \"Silver Bells\" sequence to a busy New York City street at the peak of Christmas shopping season. In the end it is not only the most impressive scene in the movie, but one of the most impressive scenes touching upon Christmas in any movie.Despite being released in April, The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) did well at the box office. And while it may not be as highly regarded as such classics as Christmas in Connecticut (1945), It's a Wonderful Life (1946), Miracle on 34th Street (1947), or The Bishop's Wife (1947), The Lemon Drop Kid (1951) remains a holiday favourite of many classic movie fans. While it may be best known as the movie that introduced the Christmas standard \"Silver Bells,\" many realize it has much more to offer."},
{"title": "Bing Crosby and Christmas", "date": "Saturday, December 18, 2021", "text": "With the possible exception of Gene Autry, there has probably never been an entertainer so closely associated with Christmas as Bing Crosby. Not only was his biggest hit a Christmas song (\"White Christmas\"), but that song remains the biggest selling single of all time. Over the years Bing Crosby appeared in numerous radio and television Christmas specials and recorded a number of Christmas songs and albums. In the mid-20th Century, it may well have been difficult to picture Christmas without Bing Crosby. While \"White Christmas\" looms large in Bing Crosby's legend, his association with Christmas began long before its release in 1942. Bing Crosby's long association with Christmas began in 1935 with the Christmas edition of The Kraft Music Hall, which Mr. Crosby co-hosted with Paul Whiteman at that point. The Kraft Music Hall would include an annual Christmas edition every year that Bing Crosby hosted. In 1946 Bing Crosby moved to the show Philco Radio Time, where he also hosted an annual Christmas edition. Bing Crosby would have different shows from the late Forties into the Fifties, including This is Bing Crosby (1948-1960), The Bing Crosby-Chesterfield Show (1949-1952), The Bing Crosby Show for General Electric (1952-1954), and The Bing Crosby Show (1954-1956). On each of these shows Christmas episodes were annual traditions. After Bing Crosby's last radio show ended in 1956, he continued to do Christmas specials on radio each titled A Christmas Sing with Bing. Starting in 1946, these annual radio specials would last until 1962.Strangely enough, while Bing Crosby's radio shows had featured Christmas episodes starting in 1935 and afterwards he hosted six years' worth of Christmas specials on radio, he was a relative latecomer when it came to Christmas specials on television. He was a guest on the 1957 Christmas edition of The Frank Sinatra Show, \"Happy Holidays with Bing and Frank.\" He would not host his first Christmas television special, The Bing Crosby Christmas Show, until 1961. After The Bing Crosby Christmas Show in 1961, Bing Crosby would appear each year in either a Christmas special or a Christmas episode of a television show for the next sixteen years.  In 1964 rather than a Christmas special, he appeared in a Christmas episode of his sitcom The Bing Crosby Show, \"The Christmas Show.\" That having been said, descriptions of the episode make it sound as if it differed very little from his Christmas specials. In 1965, 1966, 1967, and 1968 he hosted the Christmas episodes of the variety show The Hollywood Palace. Interestingly enough, in 1968 this put Bing Crosby in competition with himself. While The Hollywood Palace was airing on ABC, his movie White Christmas (1954) was airing on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies! Bing Crosby continued to host his own Christmas specials until the final one in 1977. That Christmas special, Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas, may remain his most famous Christmas special of al. Filmed in London in September 1977, among his guests was David Bowie, with whom he performed the duet \"Peace on Earth\"/\"Little Drummer Boy.\" \"Peace on Earth\"/\"Little Drummer Boy\" would be released as a single in 1982 by RCA. It peaked at no. 3 on the UK single chart and received a good deal of airplay on American radio stations. It was only a few weeks after Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas had been filmed that Bing Crosby died of a massive heart attack at age 74. The special aired posthumously, bring an end to the tradition of Bing Crosby Christmas specials that had existed since the 1930s. Of course, while Bing Crosby hosted Christmas specials on radio and television for years, he also recorded a large number of Christmas songs. The first Christmas song he ever recorded was a version of \"Silent Night\" in 1935. That initial version remained unreleased because Mr. Crosby felt it was not right for an entertainer to make money from a religious song. \"Silent Night\" was then re-recorded and it was arranged for all the money made from it to go to charity. This version of \"Silent Night\" went to no. 7 on the Billboard singles chart. Bing Crosby would not record much in the way of Christmas songs until 1942, when a holiday-themed movie would bring him his biggest hit. Holiday Inn (1942) featured the songs \"Happy Holiday\" and \"White Christmas.\" Bing Crosby had actually performed \"White Christmas\" eight months before the movie was released. He first performed it on The Kraft Music Hall on December 25 1941. Curiously, at the time it was thought \"Be Careful It's My Heart,\" performed during the Valentine's Day sequence in Holiday Inn, would be the big hit from the movie. Initially \"Be Careful Its My Heart\" did perform the best of the two songs, making it all the way to no. 2 on the Billboard Pop chart. As the months grew closer to December, however, \"White Christmas\" began to pick up steam. In 1942 it ultimately spent eleven weeks on the Billboard Pop chart. It would return to the Billboard charts twenty different times before Billboard created a separate holiday chart. It became the biggest selling single of all time and remains so to this day.Holiday Inn and \"White Christmas\" marked Bing Crosby's most prolific period recording Christmas songs, from 1942 to 1955. In 1943 he would have another hit that would become a Christmas standard, \"I'll Be Home for Christmas.\" was written by lyricist Kim Gannon and composer Walter Kent, who had in mind the men and women serving overseas during World War II. The song struck a chord and remained on the Billboard Pop charts for eleven weeks, peaking at no. 3. Bing Crosby would have several more major hit Christmas songs, including his own version of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" \"A Marshmallow World,\" his version of \"Silver Bells,\" among others.Bing Crosby also recorded Christmas songs with the Andrew Sisters. The first record they recorded together was \"Ciribiribin (They're So in Love)\" in 1939. In 1943 Bing Crosby and the Andrew Sisters recorded their first Christmas song together, \"Jingle Bells.\" They later recorded  \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" in 1947, \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" and \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" in 1949, and \"Poppa Santa Claus\"  and \"Mele Kalikimaka\" in 1950. After 1955 Bing Crosby recorded Christmas songs less frequently, although he would continue to release Christmas albums. His first was Merry Christmas in 1945. It was followed by Christmas Greetings in 1949, A Christmas Sing with Bing around the World in 1956, I Wish You a Merry Christmas in 1962, and others. Of course, compilation albums of his Christmas songs have continued to be released even after his death. It is mark of how strongly linked Bing Crosby is with Christmas that his songs his songs continue to make the Billboard Holiday chart. In 2011 Billboard created the holiday chart, and since then multiple Bing Crosby songs have hit the chart each year. It should come as no surprise that \"White Christmas\" has made the Billboard Holiday chart every year since its creation. And while it is more associated with Perry Como, so has Bing Crosby's version of \"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas.\" Bing Crosby's Christmas television specials remain available on DVD and some have found their way onto YouTube. Both Holiday Inn and White Christmas continue to air on multiple television outlets each year. Forty four years after his death, Bing Crosby is still linked to Christmas in many people's minds."},
{"title": "\"Here Comes Santa Claus (Down Santa Calus Lane)\" by Gene Autry", "date": "Friday, December 17, 2021", "text": "\"Here Comes Santa Claus (Down Santa Claus Lane)\" was the first Christmas song ever recorded by singing cowboy Gene Autry. It was also one of his biggest hits. The song went to #9 on the Billboard pop chart and #5 on the Billboard country chart. It marked the first many Christmas songs would record, including \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" which remains one of the biggest singles of all time, and \"Frosty the Snowman.\"The roots of \"Here Come Santa Claus (Down Santa Claus Lane)\" are in Hollywood history. In 1928 prominent businessman Colonel Harry Baine conceived of a Christmas parade to promote the businesses along Hollywood Boulevard. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce agreed to Colonel Baine's idea and as result the first Santa Claus Lane Parade was held in 1928. The area of Hollywood Boulevard from La Brea Avenue to Vine Street was renamed \"Santa Claus Lane.\" That first Santa Claus Lane Parade was rather modest. It featured only a few floats and Santa Claus escorted by Universal starlet Jeanette Loff.While the Santa Claus Lane Parade started out small, it grew swiftly in the coming years. The businesses in Hollywood received the cooperation of the studios, so that movie stars appeared in the parade and even served as Grand Marshals. For instance, popular comedian Joe E. Brown was the Grand Marshal of the Santa Claus Lane Parade in 1932. By the mid-Thirties, the parade not only featured floats, movie stars, and Santa Claus, but equestrian units and marching bands as well. The Santa Claus Lane Parade was suspended from the years 1942 to 1944 because of World War II, but it returned in 1945 bigger than ever. It was renamed the \"Hollywood Christmas Parade\" in 1978. Gene Autry had served as the Grand Marshal of the Santa Claus Lane Parade in 1939. He later rode in the parade in 1946, during which he heard children shouting, \"Here comes Santa Claus!\" The experience inspired him to write the lyrics to \"Here Come Santa Claus (Down Santa Claus Lane),\" with  Oakley Haldeman writing the music. The song proved to be a hit when released in 1947. He re-recorded it in 1953 and then again in 1957. Since its original release it has been covered by everyone from Bing Crosby to Elvis Presley. The song was included in Gene Autry's 1949 movie The Cowboy and the Indians, its only appearance in a Gene Autry film. The Cowboy and the Indians is notable for the first appearance of Gene Autry's signature song, \"Back in the Saddle Again.\" It is also notable for featuring Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels not long before they appeared together on the TV show The Lone Ranger.Without further ado, here is \"Here Comes Santa Claus (Down Santa Claus Lane).\""},
{"title": "Those Times Santa Claus Was Naughty in Advertisements", "date": "Thursday, December 16, 2021", "text": "The popular image of Santa Claus is jolly, kind, and morally upright old man who spreads Christmas joy and brings gifts to everyone. This was not always the case in the 20th Century, when some advertisements insisted on portraying Santa as, well, naughty. This might seem surprising today, but the mid-20th Century was a politically incorrect time when smoking was acceptable and sex was used to sell everything. During this time Santa drank and smoke, and even had an eye for the ladies in ads. Yes, that's Kris Kringle himself smoking in this 1951 Pall Mall ad! Of course, keep in mind this was 13 years before the Surgeon General's first report on smoking. Not only did ads portray Santa smoking cigarettes, but cigars as well. Indeed, in this 1940 White Owl ad not only is Saint Nick smoking a cigar, but a lady who is definitely not Mrs. Claus is sitting on his lap!In vintage ads not only does Santa smoke, but he also drinks! What is more, from the size of those bottles in this 1936 Martini Vermouth he drinks a lot. I guess travelling around the world distributing gifts in a 24 hour period is stressful...If smoking and drinking seems out of character for Santa Claus, then what about Santa being a peeping Tom in this 1944 Kayser Hosiery ad? The artist was Whitney Darrow, one of the many legendary cartoonists to work for The New Yorker. In this 1951 ad for Mojud Stockings, Santa gives a present to a lady whose dress has gotten caught in her Christmas tree. From that look on Santa's face, I have to wonder that he isn't hoping she is on the Naughty List."},
{"title": "One More Michael Nesmith Song", "date": "Wednesday, December 15, 2021", "text": "I am still reeling from the death of Michael Nesmith last Friday. Those who know me would hardly be surprised, as I have always been a huge Monkees fan and Mike was always my favourite. It is for that reason I decided tonight to share another one of my favourite songs by Michael Nesmith. It is \"Papa Gene's Blues.\" It is one of Michael Nemisth's many songs in which the title seemingly has nothing to do with the song. Indeed, if \"Papa Gene's Blues\" seems like an odd title for the song, consider that its original title was \"Brand X.\" The title did present some problems for Colgems, who misspelled it on some early pressings of the first album, The Monkees, as \"Papa Jean's Blues.\""},
{"title": "Godspeed Anne Rice", "date": "Tuesday, December 14, 2021", "text": "Anne Rice, who revolutionized horror fiction with such books as The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, died on December 11 2021 at the age of 80. The cause was complications from a stroke.Anne Rice was born  Howard Allen Frances O'Brien on October 4 1941 in New Orleans. Explanations for her male birth name have varied, but all agree that she was named for her father. She adopted the name\"Anne\" on her first day of school. A nun asked her what her name was, ad she said \"Anne,\" because she thought it was a pretty name. Her name was legally changed to \"Anne\" in 1947. Her mother died when she was 15, and her father later remarried. Her father moved the family to north Texas when she was 16. It was at Richardson High School in north Texas that she met her future husband Stan Rice. After graduating from Richardson High School she attended for her freshman year and North Texas State College also in Denton for her sophomore year. She dropped out of college because she ran out of money. After moving to California she completed her education at the University of San Francisco and San Francisco State University. It was in 1976 that Anne Rice's first book, Interview with The Vampire was published. It was the first book in the The Vampire Chronicles series and introduced her most famous character, Lestat. It would be followed by the much more successful The Vampire Lestat in 1985. It would be followed by twelve more novels in The Vampire Chronicles. Her second book was the historical novel The Feast of All Saints in 1979. In 1983 the novel The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, which she wrote under the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaure, was published. It was the first in her series of erotic novels based on the \"Sleeping Beauty\" fairy tale. In 1965 Exit to Eden and in 1986 Belinda were published. Both were under the pseudonym Anne Rampling and both were erotic fiction.In 1989 Ramses the Damned was published. It dealt with the resurrected mummy trope. It was followed by two more Ramses novels. The following year The Witching Hour, the first in the trilogy Lives of the Mayfair Witches, was published. In the Naughts  she wrote two religious novels, Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt and Christ  the Lord: The Road to Cana. In 2012 The Wolf Gift was published, the first of two books dealing with lycanthropy. Anne Rice revolutionized vampire fiction. She was among the first authors to humanize vampires, starting with Interview with The Vampire. In humanizing vampires, Anne Riche also altered the mythos surrounding them. Not to content to use the myths established by Bram Stoker and countless vampire movies, Mrs. Rice created her own myths. She also infused her novels with an eroticism that was not yet commonplace in works on vampires. Anne Rice would bring her own take to other classic figures of horror as well, from resurrected mummies to witches to werewolves. Anne Rice changed the horror genre forever."},

Cara Williams was born Bernice Kamiat in Brooklyn, New York on June 29 1925. Her parents divorced when she was very young, and her mother moved the family to Los Angeles. Bernice Kamiat took an interest in acting while very young and chose \"Cara Williams\" as her stage name. She attended the Hollywood Professional school and began acting on radio. She was only 16 years old when she was signed by 20th Century Fox. Cara Williams made her film debut in a small role in Wide Open Town in 1941. She appeared in small, often uncredited roles in such films as Girls' Town (1942), In the Meantime, Darling (1944), and Laura (1944). She had her first major role in Boomerang (1947). For the remainder of the Forties she appeared in such films as Sitting Pretty (1948), The Saxon Charm (1948), and Knock on Any Door (1949). She made her television debut in an episode of Theatre of Romance in 1949. The following year she appeared in the shows The Clock, The Philco Television Playhouse, The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre, The Web, Starlight Theatre, The Billy Rose Show, and Suspense.In the Fifties Cara Williams made several guest appearances on the TV show Alfred Hitchcock Presents. In 1960 she began playing Gladys on the sitcom Pete and Gladys, opposite Harry Morgan as Pete. She guest starred on the show Robert Montgomery Presents, Armstrong Circle Theatre, Broadway Television Theatre, Steve Randall, Matinee Theatre, On Trial, Lux Video Theatre, Jane Wyman Presents Fireside Theatre, Date with the Angels, Naked City, Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, and Zane Grey Theatre. She appeared in the movies The Girl Next Door (1953), Monte Carlo Baby (1953), The Great Diamond Robbery (1954), Meet Me in Las Vegas (1956), The Helen Morgan Story (1957), The Defiant Ones (1958), and Never Steal Anything Small (1949).In the Sixties she continued to star on Pete and Gladys. She also starred in the single season sitcom The Cara Williams Show. She guest starred on Jackie Gleason: American Scene Magazine, The Red Skelton Show, and Valentine's Day. She appeared in the movie The Man from Diner's Club (1963). In the Seventies she guest starred on Rhoda, Medical Center, and Visions. She appeared in the movies Doctor's Wives (1971), The White Buffalo (1977), and The One Man Jury (1978). She made her last appearance on film in the TV movie In Security in 1982. Chances are good that Cara Williams might be best remembered as Gladys, Pete's scatter-brained wife on Pete and Gladys, but she played a wide variety of role throughout her career. She played waitress Irene Nelson, a witness to murder, in Boomerang. In The Defiant Ones she played a mother who takes in two escaped convicts (Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis), a role for which she was nominated for an Oscar. In The Man form the Diner's Club she played a gangster's moll who becomes involved with the meek Diner's Club clerk (Danny Kaye) of the title. Cara Williams was equally adept at comedy and drama, and always gave a good performance, no matter small her role."},
{"title": "My Favourite Michael Nesmith Songs", "date": "Saturday, December 11, 2021", "text": "There are those artists we love from our earliest days, so early that we might not even recall where we first encountered them. The Monkees number among those artists for me. I might have seen the TV show in its first run on NBC, although I don't remember it. My much older sister owned The Monkees' albums and they were frequently played on the radio, so I am certain I must have heard their songs while very young. One thing of which I am certain is that I watched the reruns of The Monkees faithfully when CBS started showing the series in 1969. At six years old something about both the show and the band just clicked for me. I have to think much of it was that it was sheer escapism of the sort young boys enjoy. The Monkees faced everything from gangsters to modern day pirates to the Devil himself. While The Monkees was an escapist TV show, to a small degree it had an underlying message. Quite simply, each week it showed that four down-and-out young men could come out on top against whatever was thrown against them. Fora young boy or, really, anyone of any age, that can be an important message to hear.While I love all four Monkees, from the beginning Michael Nesmith was my favourite. Mike was the intellectual of the group, possessed with very dry wit and a keen mind. It was Mike who most often got The Monkees out of any jams they were in, who came up with any solutions to problems they might face. As a relatively intelligent lad whose humour was ea bit left of centre even then, I identified with Mike, even if I might not possess his leadership skills (I still don't). Of course, The Monkees was more than a sitcom. Each week it featured at least one song performed by the band, and some of those songs were written by the band members themselves. Indeed, Michael Nesmith was a songwriter before the TV show even debuted. He had written and recorded his own singles before the debut of The Monkees. His song \"Mary, Mary\" (later covered by The Monkees) was recorded by The Paul Butterfield Band in 1966, and his song \"Different Drum\" was recorded by The Greenbriar Boys that year. Michael Nesmith's songs for The Monkees number among my favourites of the band, and I love a number of his solo songs as well. In tribute to the great Michael Nesmith, I thought I would post some of my favourite songs he wrote. These aren't all of my favourites, by any means. Since I can't decide which ones I like best, I decided to present them in chronological order. \"Sweet Young Thing\" was co-written by Michael Nesmith, Gerry Goffin, and Carole King, but it is identifiably a Michael Nesmith song. Indeed, it sounds a lot like his other early work. It is my second favourite Monkees song, after \"She\" (which was composed by Boyce and Hart).Angry at Don Kirshner for releasing the album without The Monkees' input or even knowledge, Michael Nesmith once called the band's second album, More of The Monkees, \"the worst album in the history of the world.\" That having been said, for all its shortcomings, More of The Monkees does include some of the band's best songs, including \"She,\" Michael Nesmith's own \"Mary, Mary,\" \"(I'm Not Your) Steppin'' Stone,\" and \"I'm a Believer.\" Among those songs is \"The Kind of Girl I Could Love.\" It has always numbered among my favourite songs by Michael Nesmith. Headquarters was historic as the first Monkees album recorded without substantial use of session musicians. \"You Just May Be The One\" had been recorded earlier for the television show, but for the album The Monkees recorded a new version. What is more, it is the one song on Headquarters on which all four Monkees play the same instruments that they are shown playing on the show (Mike on guitar, Peter on bass, Micky on drums, and Davy on tambourine). While I love both versions, I do prefer the album version of \"You Just May Be the One\" to the TV version. It has always been one of my favourite Monkees songs, although for a time I couldn't listen to it without breaking down in tears as I identify it with someone who is no longer with us.\"Daily Nightly\" was inspired by the Sunset Strip curfew riots, and the media's misinformation regarding them. The Monkees had earlier discussed the Sunset Strip curfew riots at the end of the episode \"Find The Monkees,\" even going so far as to point out that the word \"riots\" was inaccurate. Along with \"Star Collector\" (also from the album Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, & Jones Ltd.), \"Daily Nightly\" was the first song on which a Moog synthesizer was used.As mentioned earlier, Michael Nesmith's song \"Different Drum\" was first recorded by The Greenbriar Boys. It was included on their album Better Late Than Never! in 1966. Michael Nesmith had offered \"Different Drum\" to The Monkees, but it was one of a number of Michael Nesmith's songs that was rejected by music supervisor Don Kirshner. The Stone Poneys then recorded their own version of their song and relased it as a single. It went to no. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. For me this is yet more evidence that Don Krishner was not the music expert he thought he was...\"Tapioca Tundra\" appeared on the album The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees and it was also the B-side of the second single from the album, \"Valleri.\" It did particularly well as a B-side, actually going to no. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Circle Sky\" is perhaps best known for its inclusion in The Monkees' movie Head. The movie features a live performance of the song filmed at the Valley Auditorium in Salt Lake City on May 17 1968. Sadly, the movie Head bombed at the box office. Its soundtrack album became the first Monkees album not to reach the top ten on the Billboard album chart, going only to no. 45. A new version would later be recorded for The Monkees' 1996 album Justus. \"Rio\" was a single from Michael Nesmith's 1977 album From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing. At the time music videos were hardly unknown. Musical short films have existed nearly as long as talking motion pictures have. In the Forties Soundies were made for the Panoram visual jukebox and in the late Fifties and Sixties there were musical shorts made for the Scopitone, Cinebox, and Color-Sonics visual jukeboxes. Of course, in the Sixties promotional films were made for artists from The Beatles to The Monkees' songwriters Boyce & Hart. That having been said, the music video for \"Rio\" was historic. In 1977 many American artists did not bother with music videos. What is more, conceptual videos were just coming into their own at the time. \"Rio\" would then have an impact. Indeed, while the video was shot in 1977, it looks like something that could have come from the Eighties.\"Cruisin'\" was the last single Michael Nesmith would release as a solo artist. It was from his 1979 album  Infinite Rider on the Big Dogma. A music video was shot for Michael Nesmith's 1981 collection of comedy skits and music videos Elephant Parts. Elephant Parts also included the music video for \"Rio,\" as well as music videos for \"Magic,\" \"Light,\" and \"Tonight.\" Elephant Parts won the first Grammy for Music Video. As to Sunset Sam in the \"Cruisin'\" video that is Steve Strong, not a young Hulk Hogan as often reported."},
{"title": "The Late Great Michael Nesmith", "date": "Friday, December 10, 2021", "text": "I am not sure when I was first exposed to The Monkees. The show debuted when I was three years old, but I don't have any memories of watching it at the time. That having been said, my sister (who is 17 years older than I am) owned The Monkees' albums, and their songs were played frequently on the radio at the time. While I can't say for certain when I was first exposed to The Monkees, I can pinpoint when I became a fan. In 1969 CBS began rerunning The Monkees on Saturday morning and I was hooked. Michael Nesmith was my favourite Monkee from the beginning. Looking back, it made perfect sense that he would be my favourite, as we had a lot in common. He was \"the quiet Monkee,\" the contemplative, intellectual member of the group. He also had a sardonic sense of humour. As I got older I learned of his musical contributions to The Monkees and his solo career as well. As I grew up, I remained a fan of The Monkees and Michael Nesmith. Sadly, Michael Nesmith died today at the age of 78 from heart failure.Robert Michael Nesmith was born on December 30 1942 in Houston, Texas. His parents divorced when he was only four years old. His mother, Bette, then moved to Dallas to be closer to her family. Michael Nesmith was 13 when Bette Nesmith invented Liquid Paper, a typewriter correction fluid. She headed the Liquid Paper Corporation until 1979 when she sold it to Gillette. She died on May 12 1980 following a stroke at age 56. 0Michael Nesmith enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1960, before he could graduate from highs school, although he earned a high school equivalency diploma during his service. He attended San Antonio College, where he and John Kuehne won the first San Antonio College talent award. It was also during this period that he began to write songs. In 1964 he moved to Los Angeles to further pursue his music career. It was in 1963 that he released his first single, \"Wanderin',\" on the Highness label. In 1965, with bassist John London and drummer Bill Sleeper, he released the single \"How Can You Kiss Me\" on the Omnibus label under the name Mike & John & Bill. Using the name \"Mike Blessing,\" he released two singles on the Colpix label, \"Until It's Time for You to Go\" and \"Just a Little Love.\" It was also during this period that Michael Nesmith wrote the song \"Different Drum\" The song was first recorded by The Greenbriar Boys and included on their album Better Late Than Never!.  In 1967 it was recorded by The Stone Poneys and released as a single. It went to no. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.It was in 1965 that Michael Nesmith answered an ad that had been published in Daily Variety and Hollywood Reporter which read, \"Madness!! Auditions. Folk & Roll Musicians-Singers for acting roles in new TV series. Running parts for 4 insane boys, age 17–21. Want spirited Ben Frank's-types. Have courage to work. Must come down for interview.\" Michael Nesmith found himself cast as one of four struggling musicians on the television show The Monkees. The Monkees was a multi-media project that saw the recording of songs that would also be released as singles and on albums by The Monkees. Michael Nesmith wrote and even sang lead on many of the songs recorded by The Monkees, including \"Sweet Young Thing,\" \"The Kid of Girl I Could Love,\" \"You Just Maybe the One,\" \"Circle Sky,\" \"Listen to the Band,\" and others. Everything would not go smoothly in the early days of The Monkees. Music supervisor Don Kirshner would not allow The Monkees to play their instruments on their songs. This ultimately led to the band rebelling against Kirshner's control. In the end Kirshner was dismissed as music supervisor in February 1967.As one of The Monkees, Michael Nesmith appeared in the movie Head (1968), which initially failed at the box office, but would later become a cult film. He also appeared in the television special 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee. In 1970 Michael Nesmith left The Monkees, his last participation in the group being appearances in commercials for Kool-Aid and Nerf. It was while he was with The Monkees that he released what could be considered his first solo album, The Wichita Train Whistle Sings, in 1968. It was after he left The Monkees that he formed The First National Band. The First National Band recorded three albums, and had a hit with the single \"Joanne\" (which went to no. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100.Following the break-up of The First National Band, Michael Nesmith formed The Second National Band. The Second National Band released one album. Following the break-up of The Second National Band, Michael Nesmith recorded eight more solo albums. In 1974 he formed Pacific Arts Corporation to develop various media projects. It was in the late Seventies that Michael Nesmith became a pioneer in music videos. He created a music video for his single \"Rio\" in 1977. The video for \"Rio\" led Michael Nesmith to develop the television show PopClips. PopClips was an early music video show, hosted by Jeff Michalski. It proved successful following its debut on Nickelodeon in 1980. In fact, it was so successful that Warner/Amex wanted to buy both the name and the concept from Michael Nesmith. When he refused, they developed their own concept, MTV. It was in 1981 that Michael Nesmith released the video album Elephant Parts. The success of Elephant Parts led to a short-lived television show on NBC in 1985, Michael Nesmith in Television Parts. Michael Nesmith also served as executive producer on the movies Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann (1982), Repo Man (1984), and Tapeheads (1988). Michael Nesmith would eventually reunite with his fellow Monkees. In 1986 MTV aired a marathon of episodes of The Monkees, reigniting interest in both the show and the group. The Monkees then played a 20th Anniversary Tour in North America. Due to his commitments to Pacific Arts Corporation, Michael Nesmith was unable to take part, but did play with the group at the concert at the he Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles on July 9 1989. He reunited with The Monkees in 1995 to record the album Justus, as well as the television special Hey, Hey, It's The Monkees. He toured the United Kingdom with the other Monkees in 1997. Following the death of Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith toured with Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork in 2012, 2013, and 2014. In 2016 he contributed to The Monkees' album Good Times. He would tour with Micky Dolenz in 2018 and again in 2019. They toured for one last time this year. Michael Nesmith's last appearance on November 14 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. As one of The Monkees, Michael Nesmith appeared on the shows Laugh-In, The Hollywood Squares, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, and The Johnny Cash Show. He also appeared on Saturday Night Live and Portlandia. He appeared in the movies Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann, Repo Man, Burglar (1987), and Tapeheads (1988). Of all the celebrity deaths this year, Michael Nemsith's death has been the most difficult for me to handle. Mike was always my favourite Monkee. On The Monkees he was the level-headed one, the one who generally got The Monkees out of the various scrapes they found themselves in. In \" The Devil and Peter Tork,\" it was Mike who convinced Peter that the talent to play the harp existed within him, thus denying the Devil Peter's soul. Michael Nesmith's songs were always among my favourite Monkees songs. Indeed, \"Sweet Young Thing\" is my second favourite Monkees song after \"She\" (a Boyce & Hart composition). I followed Michael Nesmith's career after his stint with The Monkees, including \"Rio\" and Elephant Parts.While Mike on The Monkees was essentially a fictionalized version of Michael Nesmith, Michael Nesmith shared a good many of qualities with his television counterpart. He founded Pacific Arts Corporation, which at one time had the biggest catalogue of non-theatrical video titles. With \"Rio\" he pioneered one of the earliest American rock videos. With PopClips he spurred the popularity of music videos, leading to the creation of MTV. As a solo artist he continued to write a number of memorable songs, including \"Joanne,\" \"Rio,\" \"Cruisnin',\" and others. While he will always be remembered as a Monkee, Michael Nesmith was so much more."},

{"title": "\"Run, Rudolph, Run\" by Chuck Berry", "date": "Monday, December 6, 2021", "text": "\"Run, Rudolph, Run\" by Chuck Berry is one of the all time great Christmas rock 'n' roll songs. It was released on November 19 1958. and has since become a standard. The song was originally attributed to C. Berry Music (Chuck Berry's company)-M. Brodie. Strangely enough, the many cover versions of the song attribute it to Johnny Marks-Marvin Broadie. The identity of Marvin Broadie is a bit of a mystery, but Johnny Marks is well known as the writer of the song \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" as well as such Christmas classics as \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" and \"Holly Jolly Christmas.\"Of course, this begs the question as to whether Johnny Marks actually wrote Run, Rudolph, Run.\" It sounds exactly like the sort of song Chuck Berry would write. In fact, its melody is pretty much the same as his song \"Little Queenie,\" recorded in the same session. \"Little Queenie\" was attributed to Chuck Berry alone. It also resembles Chuck Berry's other songs, from \"Roll Over Beethoven\" to \"Johnny B. Goode.\" It then seems likely Chuck Berry was one of the writers, if not the only writer on the song.If this is the case, then why is Johnny Marks credited? Much of it may be the fact that Rudolph was not in the public domain at the time and still isn't in the public domain. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was created by Robert May for a promotion for Montgomery Ward. Montgomery Ward allowed Robert May to retain the copyright on Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. To handle the rights to the character Robert May founded The Rudolph Company L.P., which still controls the rights to the character to this day. This brings us to Robert May's brother-in-law Johnny Marks, who received permission from him to write the song \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\" The song \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" is owned by Johnny Marks's company, St. Nicholas Music, Inc. It seems likely that St. Nicholas Music, Inc. lodged a complaint against \"Run, Rudolph, Run,\" and as a result Mr. Marks was credited on a song he did not write (although he did shape Rudolph as we know him). Regardless of who wrote \"Run, Rudolph, Run,\" it remains a classic to this day and has been covered multiple times."},

That is, he may be best known for playing pretentious intellectuals. Despite this, what may be his best known characters were not pretentious intellectuals. He was Uncle Tonoose on the classic sitcom Make Room for Daddy/The Danny Thomas Show. He was Snidely Whiplash on Dudley Do-Right and yet other characters on Jay Ward's cartoons. He played hapless pilot Wrongway Feldman on Gilligan's Island twice. Hans Conried was a versatile actor who may have been best known for playing pretentious intellectuals, but he played a whole host of other character types as well.Hans Conried was born on April 15 1917 in Baltimore. He was raised in both Baltimore and New York City. He studied acting at Columbia University with the goal of becoming a serious actor who played Shakespeare. He appeared on stage before going into radio, where he first made a considerable mark. He was a regular on the radio sitcom My Friend Irma, playing Professor Kropotkin, the upstairs neighbour of Irma and her family. His performance as Professor Kropotkin demonstrated one of his talents as an actor. Quite simply, he was a master of dialects. As Professor Kropotkin he spoke with a Russian accent. Through the years he would play characters who spoke with other accents, from East European to Mediterranean. Mr. Conried would also appear regularly on other classic radio shows. He was a psychiatrist that George often consulted on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. He also appeared regularly on The Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy Show, Ceiling Unlimited, The Judy Canova Show, Life with Luigi, My Favourite Husband, The Alan Young Show, and yet others. He guest starred on many radio shows, including Hallmark Playhouse, The Jack Carson Show, The Dinah Shore Show, Lights Out, and many more. His last performance on radio was on CBS Radio Mystery Theatre in the Seventies.Hans Conried moved from radio into movies. He made his movie debut in a small part in Dramatic School in 1939, but he would play bit parts in movies (often uncredited) until 1942. It was in 1942 that he appeared in his first major role in Blondie's Blessed Event. In Blondie's Blessed Event, Hans Conried plays George Wickley, a down-and-out playwright that Dagwood (Arthur Lake) had met at a hotel at a architect's convention. George moves in with Dagwood and Blondie (Penny Singleton) and quickly takes over their household. Hans Conried easily steals every scene that he is in, and he is easily the best part of Blondie's Blessed Event. Hans Conried's career in film and radio would be interrupted by military service during World War II. In September 1944 he enlisted in the United States Army. At Fort Knox he trained to be a tank crewman until it was determined he was too tall for such. He was then trained as a heavy mortar crewman. He served in the Philippines until fellow actor Jack Kruschen (another master of dialects) was able to have him transferred to the Armed Forces Network. Hans Conried resumed his movie career playing Karl, a hotel waiter who also happens to be a Communist, in The Senator is Indiscreet. While Hans Conried would appear in several movies, his biggest impact may have been as the voices of Mr. Darling and Captain Hook in the classic Disney movie Peter Pan (1953). That same year he played what may be his most notable movie role aside from the two in Peter Pan: Dr. Terwilliker, the imperious piano teacher of the title in The 5,000 fingers of Dr. T. (1953). That very same year he played Professor Amos Pomfritt  the meddlesome English instructor in The Affairs of Dobie Gillis (1953). While Hans Conried primarily appeared in television following the Fifties, he continued appearing in movies into the Seventies. He played Professor Whatley in The Shaggy D.A. (1976) and Dr. Barnes in Oh, God! Book II (1980), his final film role.Hans Conried appeared in the medium of television very early, making his TV debut in 1949 in an episode of Oboler Comedy Theatre. It was in 1955 that he would appear in one of his most famous roles, that of Uncle Tonoose on Make Room for Daddy/The Danny Thomas Show. Uncle Tonoose was Danny's brash, over-the-top, highly traditional uncle and the patriarch of the family. Uncle Tonoose may well have been the most popular character on the show and it is safe to say his appearances were highly anticipated by viewers. Hans Conried would reprise his role as Uncle Tonoose in the sequel to Make Room for Daddy/The Danny Thomas Show, Make Room for Granddaddy in 1970 and 1971.Aside from Uncle Tonoose, it is possible that Hans Conried's most famous television character was Snidely Whiplash, the moustache twirling villain on the \"Dudley Do-Right\" segment of Rocky and His Friends and The Bullwinkle Show. Hans Conried would do a good deal of voice work for Jay Ward beyond Snidely Whiplash. He was the host and narrator of Jay Ward's show Fractured Flickers. On Hoppity Hooper he was the voice of Waldo P. Wigglesworth, the title character's friend, a fox who sold patent medicines and often engaged in confidence schemes. He served as the narrator on the pilot episode of George of the Jungle. Hans Conried did other voice work beyond Jay Ward's animated series. He did voices for characters on various episodes of Disneyland. As Boris Karloff died, he served as both the narrator and the voice of the Grinch in the TV special Halloween is Grinch Night. Later he was Dr. Dred on the 1980s cartoon Drak Pack and provided various voices for Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends.Among Hans Conried's most famous roles is one he only played twice. Hans Conried played the role of Wrongway Feldman on the Gilligan's Island episodes \"Wrongway Feldman\" and \"The Return of Wrongway Feldman.\" Wrongway Feldman was a World War I fighter pilot who tried to fly around the world in his plane The Spirit of the Bronx. The problem is that Wrongway, true to this name, has a terrible sense of direction. The first time he crashed on the island, he left in hopes of getting help for the castaways. He later returned, only to leave again and crash on what he described as a strange island (that sounded suspiciously like Hawaii). In the Disneyland episode \"Davy Crockett and the Alamo,\" he made another notable appearance, playing the conman Thimblerig. Hans Conried would make many other notable guest appearances through the years on such shows as I Love Lucy; The Red Skelton Show; Have Gun--Will Travel; Mister Ed; Hogan's Heroes; Love, American Style; Kolchak: The Night Stalker; and yet others. Hans Conried continued acting until his death in 1982 at age 64 from a major heart attack. Hans Conried was certainly a great character actor. Over the years he played many intellectual types, from Professor Kropotkin to Dr. Terwilliker  in The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T. to Professor Pomfritt in The Affairs of Dobie Gillis to a number of guest appearances on television shows. Mr. Conried was nothing if not versatile, however, so that he played a number of different sorts of roles. He was as convincing as the brash Uncle Tonoose as he was as the clueless Wrongway Feldman. He could be Victorian melodrama Snidely Whiplash, but then he could also be the hapless playwright George Wickley. What is more, he was a master of accents and dialects, so that over the years he played everything from Nazi officers to Russians. Regardless of the role, Hans Conried played all of them well, to the point that he very nearly stole every scene in which he ever appeared. Hans Conried could easily dominate every scene he was in, even against such heavyweights as Danny Thomas and Lucille Ball. He was utterly unique, and is safe to say there will never be another like him."},

{"title": "Godspeed Stephen Sondheim ", "date": "Wednesday, December 1, 2021", "text": "Composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim died on November 26 2021 at the age of 91. Among his works are the lyrics for West Side Story, and the music and lyrics for such musicals as A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum and Sweeney Todd.Stephen Sondheim was born on March 22 29130 in New York City. He was ten years old when he became friends with Oscar Hammerstein II's son James Hammerstein. He also became close friends with Oscar Hammerstein II himself, who became something of a surrogate father. Oscar Hammerstein II also became his mentor and taught Stephen Sondhiem about how to construct a musical by having him write four musicals, which included a musical based on a play he admired, a musical based on a play he liked but he thought was flawed, a musical based on a novel or short story, and an original musical.  Stephen Sondhheim attended Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. Stephen Sondheim began his career in entertainment not in musical theatre, but in television. He wrote nine episodes of the classic sitcom Topper from 1953 to 1954. He would later write the episode \"In Early Winter\" for the anthology show Rendezvous. He wrote the music and lyrics for the musical Saturday Night. It was planned for the 1954-1955 Broadway season, but in the end it would not be staged until 1997 in London. It finally found its way to Broadway in 2000.His first major success came in 1957 with West Side Story, for which he wrote the lyrics (Leonard Bernstein wrote the music). He had another success with Gypsy in 1959, for which he wrote the lyrics and Jule Styne wrote the music. In 1962 he had success with the first musical for which he wrote both the lyrics and music, A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum. He followed it with Anyone Can Whistle in 1964. He wrote the lyrics for 1965's Do I Hear a Waltz?, for which Richard Rodgers wrote the music. Every musical upon which he worked afterwards he wrote both the lyrics and music for: Evening Primrose (1966), Company (1970), Follies (1971), A Little Night Music (1973), The Frogs (1974), Pacific Overtures (1976), Sweeney Todd (1979), Merrily We Roll Along (1981), Sunday in the Park with George (1984), Into the Woods (1987), Assassins (1990), Passion (1994), and Road Show (2008). In addition to his work in musical theatre, Stephen Sondheim also composed songs for the movies Reds (1981)and  Dick Tracy (1990). Arguably Stephen Sondheim revolutionized American musical theatre. Quite simply, he brought it into the modern era. His musicals often tackled subject matter that had not been tackled on Broadway before. A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum was inspired by Roman Playwright Plautus and was set in ancient Rome. A Little Night Music was Ingmar Bergman's movie Smiles on a Summer Night (1955). Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was based on the play Sweeney Todd by Christopher Bond, whose origins can be traced all the way back to the play A String of Pearls or The Fiend of Fleet Street. It dealt with a murderous barber whose accomplice then uses his victims' bodies for meat for her pies. Into the Woods as a mash-up of various fairy tales. Stephen Sondheim pushed the envelope with regards to subject matter in American musical theatre. Of course, Stephen Sondheim's revolution did not end with the subject matter of his musicals. His songs were a dramatic contrast to what had come before them on Broadway. He dis not embrace the romanticism that flowed through much of American musical theatre in the 20th Century, but instead his lyrics reflected real life. His lyrics were complicated, much as the characters in his musicals were, and could reflect defiance, sadness, confusion, and any number of other human emotions or conditions. In the end Stephen Sondheim changed American musical theatre forever. An argument can be made that he virtually invented the concept musical. He certainly broadened the scope of what a Brodway musical could be."},
{"title": "Film Noir Style: The Killer 1940s by Kimberly Truhler", "date": "Tuesday, November 30, 2021", "text": "Kimberly Truhler is a film historian and fashion historian who has worked with Turner Classic Movies, the BBC, Christie's,  the National Film Registry, and yet others. She is an expert on costume design in film and how it intersects with fashion. If you know Kimberly (as I do), you realize that she knows the subjects of costume design and fashion very, very well. It is for that reason that I was looking forward to the publication of her book, Film Noir Style: The Killer 1940s. I was not disappointed.In Film Noir Style: The Killer 1940s Kimberly examines the role of costume designers in the films noirs of the Forties and the lasting impact they sometimes had on the world of fashion. The book is divided into four sections: \"Before the War 1940-1941,\" \"The War Years 1942- 1945,\" \"The Year of Transition 1946,\" and \"The Post-War Years 1947-1950.\" Within those sections are essays on some of the greatest noirs ever made: The Maltese Falcon, Murder, My Sweet, The Postman Always Rings Twice, Out of the Past, and others. Because film, costume design, and fashion do not happen in a vacuum, Kimberly addresses much of the history of the Forties and how it impacted film, costume, design, and fashion, from World War II to the Red Scare. As might be expected, she discusses the costume designers who helped shaped the film noir movement, including Bonnie Cashin, Edith Head, Irene, Oleg Cassini, and others. Kimberly's writing is concise, so that she is able to convey a good deal of information in a short period of time, while at the same time remaining immensely readable. She explains the creation and construction of the clothing used in film noir in such a way that it is easy for someone unfamiliar with costume design to understand. Complimenting Kimberly's prose are dozens of photos from the various films discussed, as well as photos from the era. Film Noir Style: The Killer 1940s also has a very pleasing layout, so that the photos do not detract from the prose. My only real caveat with Film Noir Style: The Killer 1940s is that I do wish she had discussed the costumes of Ann Grayle (Anne Shirley) in Murder, My Sweet. The costumes of \"Big League Blonde\" Helen Grayle may be bolder than the more modest costumes worn by Ann, but I have always thought Ann's costumes were impressive in and of themselves. They certainly often a sharp contrast to Helen's costumes and helped define Ann's character in opposition to that of Helen. That having been said, this is a very small quibble and it certainly didn't distract from my enjoyment of Film Noir: The Killer 1940s. There is simply so much to love about this book.Kimberly not only has a deep understanding of film, fashion, and costume design, but of the film noir movement itself. Fans of film noir will certainly appreciate how she traces the evolution of film noir and how its costume design continues to have an impact. I am certainly looking forward to any follow-up Kimberly might write on the noirs of the 1950s."},
{"title": "Twenty Years Ago Today George Harrison Died", "date": "Monday, November 29, 2021", "text": "It was twenty years ago today that George Harrison died after a prolonged battle with cancer. He was only 58. After John, George was always my favourite Beatle. That having been said, in many ways I felt closer to George than I did John. Having been born on February 25, he was a Pisces like me. What is more, he was the only Beatle who had been to the United States prior to their historic appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. His older sister Louise lived in Illinois and Missouri until relatively recently, so that it was not unusual to see her interviewed by the local television stations. Of course, I also loved George's songs,and he probably wrote more of my favourite Beatles songs than anyone except John. George Harrison was born on February 25 1943 in Liverpool. He developed an interest in music when he was very young, and his father bought him his first guitar, in 1956. He met Paul McCartney on the bus to the Liverpool Institute, which they both attended. The two soon learned they both loved music. Paul McCartney was part of John Lennon's skiffle group The Quarrymen, the group that would evolve into The Beatles. George Harrison auditioned for The Quarrymen, but John Lennon thought the 15 year old George was too young. George auditioned for The Quarrymen a second time and impressed John by playing the lead guitar for Bill Justis's instrumental \"Raunchy.\" Afterwards George played with The Quarrymen from time to time and eventually became a full-time member. George Harrison remained with the group as they went through various names until they settled on The Beatles.George Harrison would become an integral part o The Beatles' success, both as their lead guitarist and a songwriter. As a songwriter George wrote such songs for The Beatles as \"Think for Yourself,\" \"Taxman,\" \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" \"Something,\" and \"I Me Mine.\" Although he was arguably a songwriter equal to both John Lennon and Paul McCartney, John and Paul generally restricted George to two to three songs per album. It was perhaps for that reason that George became the first Beatles to release a solo album, Wonderwall Music in 1968. On November 27 1970 his album All Things Must Pass was released. A triple album, All Things Must Pass featured songs George had written for The Beatles that had been rejected. The album received widespread critical acclaim and hit no. 1 in both the United Kingdom and the United States.It was not long after The Beatles' break-up that George Harrison also organized the Concert for Bangladesh. The charity event, held on August 1 1971, raised money for refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War. George Harrison would have a very successful solo career. Living in a Material World, his follow-up to All Things Must Pass, also hit no. 1 on the Billboard album chart. His fourth studio solo album, Dark Horse, went to no. 4 on the Billboard album chart. While his following albums would not do as well, George Harrison was still fairly successful as a recording artist.It was in 1988 that George Harrison joined Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty in the supergroup The Travelling Wilburys,. The Travelling Wilburys released two albums, both of which were fairly successful. His song, \"Handle with Care,\" served as The Travelling Wilburys' debut single. In 1994 George Harrison reunited with fellow Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr for The Beatles Anthology. This included the recording to two new Beatles songs using two tracks of John Lennon songs featuring only John's vocals and piano: \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love.\"In addition to his music career, George Harrison served as executive producer on such movies as Life of Brian (1979), Time Bandits (1981), Withnail & I (1987), and Nuns on the Run (1990). Like the rest of The Beatles, George Harrison had an enormous impact on my life. I am not sure when I became aware of The Beatles. It may have been hearing them on the radio or, more likely, The Beatles animated cartoon that aired on ABC in the mid to late Sixties. Either way, they became a part of my life and have remained my favourite rock group ever since. As my second favourite Beatle, George Harrison had a bit more impact on me than either Paul or Ringo. It is not unusual for my second favourite or even my favourite song from any given Beatles album to have been written by George Harrison. Indeed, after John Lennon's \"In My Life,\" \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" is my favourite Beatles song. For me November 29 2001 was then a day filled with tears. George Harrison meant a lot to me, and he still does."},
{"title": "DC Comics' Pow Wow Smith", "date": "Saturday, November 27, 2021", "text": "Native American characters are not particularly common in American comic books. That having been said, for much of the Fifties, National Periodical Publications published the adventures of a Native American detective. Pow Wow Smith may not be particularly well remembered today, but the character would prove successful for a time.Pow Wow Smith was Ohiyesa, a Sioux Indian from Red Deer Valley. His skill with guns, the bow, and guns, not to mention his considerable talent as a detective, resulted him being hired as deputy sheriff in the town of Elkhorn. He later became the town's sheriff. While he prefers being called by his given name of Ohiyesa. the white people round him insist upon calling him \"Pow Wow.\"Pow Wow Smith first appeared in Detective Comics no. 151, September 1949. At that point his adventures were set in the present day. Pow Wow Smith would remain a back-up feature in Detective Comics until no. 202, December 1953. The character then moved to Western Comics no. 43, February 1954, where he became the cover feature. With Western Comics no. 44, April 1954, Pow Wow Smith's adventures shifted to the Old West without any explanation of why. While Pow Wow Smith was supplanted as the cover feature by Matt Savage Trail, Boss in 1959, he would remain apart of Western Comics until its final and 85th issue, February 1951. When DC Comics rebooted their title All-Star Western with issue 1, September 1970, Pow Wow Smith was its cover feature. He would remain a part of All--Star Western  for its first several issues. An explanation for Pow Wow Smith existing both in the Old West and in the present day, with the present day Pow Wow Smith being identified as the descendant of the Pow Wow Smith of the Old West. As to his given name, it would appear that it was taken from the name of the Sioux physician also known as Charles Eastman. Dr. Eastman was well known for his works on Sioux history and one of the most eloquent commentators on Native American affairs. Since the Seventies, Pow Wow Smith's appearances have been infrequent. He was one of the detectives from that title who appeared in Detective Comics no. 500, March 1981. The Old West version of Pow Wow Smith appeared in Armageddon: The Alien Agenda no. 3, January 1992. More recently the modern day version of Pow Wow Smith appeared in Robin Annual no. 6, August 1997. He would later appear in the Justice League Unlimited episode \"The Once and Future Thing, Part One: Weird Western Tales.\" A time travel episode set in the Old West, only the villains address him as \"Pow Wow.\"While his nickname of \"Pow Wow\" is regrettable, Ohiyesa is important in the history of American comic books. He was one of the first Native American characters to have a regular series and one of the first to headline a comic book. The Pow Wow Smith feature was also one of the first to deal with racism against Native Americans, a subject rarely touched upon in comic books of the Fifties."},

{"title": "Happy Thanksgiving 2021", "date": "Thursday, November 25, 2021", "text": "Being part Cherokee, I am aware that many Native Americans view the holiday as a celebration of the genocide the colonists committed upon indigenous peoples and observe it as a day of mourning. What is more, I can fully understand their view. After all, much of the mythology of Thanksgiving is centred around the Pilgrims at Plymouth. Sadly, the Wampanoag, who according to legend dined with the Pilgrims, suffered greatly for their contact with the British colonists. That having been said, the Thanksgiving held at Plymouth was hardly the first to be held in what would become the United States, much less North America. Indeed, Native Americans had their own Thanksgiving rituals well before Europeans set foot in North America. The Seneca have Thanksgiving rituals that last four days, and other Iroquois nations have their own Thanksgiving rituals as well. The Cherokee have several different ceremonies at which we give thanks, including the Great New Moon Ceremony, the Exalting Bush Festival, and the Ripe Corn Ceremony.My only real objection to the American holiday of Thanksgiving is the fact that it is attached to the mythology of the Pilgrims. To me, we simply need to divorce the Pilgrims myth from the holiday and observe it purely as a day of giving thanks. To me the act of giving thanks is very important and,in many way beneficial to the mental health of individuals. No less than Wilma Mankiller, the first woman to serve as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, recognized the importance of expressing one's gratitude. She said,  \"We celebrate Thanksgiving along with the rest of America, maybe in different ways and for different reasons. Despite everything that's happened to us since we fed the Pilgrims, we still have our language, our culture, our distinct social system. Even in a nuclear age, we still have a tribal people.\"Of course, central to any holiday are various traditions. Here at A Shroud of Thoughts it is a tradition to post vintage pinups.

{"title": "The Dark Side of Percy Helton", "date": "Wednesday, November 24, 2021", "text": "Most fans of classic film and classic television might be familiar with Percy Helton as the drunken Santa Claus at the beginning of Miracle on 34th Street (1947) or the much put-upon Commerce Bank clerk Homer Cratchit on The Beverly Hillbillies or even the voice of Piglet in Walt Disney's \"Winnie the Pooh\" animated shorts. Fans of film noir know that Percy Helton also appeared in several film noirs in his career, including Call Northside 777 (1948), Criss Cross (1949), Thieves' Highway (1949), and yet others. In many film noirs, Percy Helton played relatively decent characters, such as the overly cautious yet sympathetic bartender in Criss Cross. In yet other noirs Percy Helton played characters who were dishonest, unscrupulous, and even downright creepy.An example of one of Percy Helton's more unsavoury characters can be seen in The Set-Up (1949). He plays Red, boxer Stoker Thompson's (Robert Ryan) trainer. Both Red and Stoker's manager Tiny (George Tobias) accept a bribe from a gangster for Stoker to take a dive in his next bout. To Red's credit, he warns Tiny that he had better tell Stoker that the bout has been fixed, reminding Tiny that the boxer can always punch him.Not only is Red dishonest, but he is a coward as well. When Stoker wins the bout, he flees the ring rather than face any consequences.Percy Helton's follow-up to The Set-Up would find him playing another somewhat cowardly character  Petey in The Crooked Way (1949) is mild-mannered, small-time crook more than willing to grovel before any authority figure. His one redeeming quality is his love for his cat, a beautiful Maine Coon, whom he carries throughout the movie despite being allergic to feline dander. In the final gunfight he finally shows some bravery trying to protect his cat. He dies in the process.If Red and Petey had some small sense of decency, it is safe to say that Doc Kennedy in Kiss Me Deadly (1955) has none. In the film Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) visits coroner Doc Kennedy (Percy Helton) for information regarding the recently deceased Christina (Cloris Leachman). Being entirely mercenary, Doc expects Hammer to pay for his information. Hammer offers to pay the coroner, but the amount the detective is offering does not met Doc's price. Hammer ends the negotiations over the price of Doc's information by slamming the coroner's fingers in a desk drawer. Naturally, Doc accepts Hammer's price afterwards. If Red, Petey, and Doc seem unsavoury, they are nothing compared to Charlie Borg, the loathsome tailor in Wicked Woman (1953). Wicked Woman is hardly a good film. In fact, it is closer to being a camp classic than a noir classic. That having been said, Charlie Borg could well be Percy Helton's most memorable character. Charlie Borg is the neighbour of the film's main character, Billie Nash (Beverly Michaels), in an apartment house. The 5'2\" Charlie is taken with the much taller Billie (some sources say Beverly Michaels was 5'9\", but other sources indicate she was actually 5'11\") from the moment he first sees her. Charlie loans her money and even cooks for her in hopes of making his dreams come true. He also spies on her constantly. This leads to Charlie figuring out Billie's plans with the handsome owner of the bar at which she works, Matt (Richard Egan). Of course, Charlie wastes no time in blackmailing Billie into having sex with him. Charlie may well be the most reprehensible character Percy Helton ever played. One certainly will never see Mr. Helton the same after having seen Wicked Woman.Of course, these are not the only noirs in which Percy Helton appeared, nor the only films in which he played shady characters. In the end Percy Helton appeared in more film noirs than some better known names more closely associated with the genre. And while today he might be better associated with comedy, it can be argued that his most memorable performances emerged in the many film noirs in which he appeared."},

{"title": "Brute Force (1947)", "date": "Monday, November 22, 2021", "text": "The popular image of film noir is a movie centred on some down-on-his-luck schmuck who is drawn into a web of intrigue by a femme fatale. Not all film noirs fit this template, however, Brute Force (1947) being among them.Quite simply, the protagonists of Bute Force are already in prison for their crimes (the fictional Westgate Prison, to be precise). The genesis for Brute Force began with producer Mark Hellinger, who had produced such films as They Drive By Night (1940), High Sierra (1941), and even the Jack Benny movie The Horn Blows at Midnight (1945).  It was after he had read an article by a former convict that he decided he wanted to make a prison movie. It would take nearly a decade for Mr. Hellinger to achieve his goal. Mark Hellinger turned to Robert Patterson, a columnist for The San Francisco Examiner to develop the movie's story. Robert Patterson took inspiration from a real life incident, the Battle of Alcatraz, a particularly violent escape attempt on the part of armed convicts at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. Unfolding from May 2 to May 4 1946, two Federal Bureau of Prisons officers and three convicts were killed during the escape attempt. Richard Patterson's story was turned into a screenplay by Richard Brooks. Richard Brooks had written the screenplay for the camp classic Cobra Woman (1944), as well as the novel Crossfire upon which the 1947 film noir of the same name was based. Brute Force was directed by Jules Dassin, who had earlier directed The Canteville Ghost (1944).  Jule Dassin would go onto direct such classic noirs as The Naked City (1948), Thieves' Highway (1948), and Night and the City (1950). While Brute Force is very much a film noir, it is also very much a message film. Quite simply, it examines the corruption of the American prison system as it was in the Forties. Westgate Prison is overcrowded and underfunded. While the warden (Roman Bohen) has good intentions, he is seems ill-equipped to deal with the prison. Much of the day-to-day running of Westgate Prison falls to the head guard, Captain Munsey  (Hume Cronyn), an utter sadist who relies on stool pigeons to report anyone violating the rules and metes out punishments that are excessive for the breaches of the rules they are meant to punish. Given the conditions at Westgate Prison, it should come as no surprise that the prisoners, led by Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster), plot to break out.Given it is set in a prison, one might be forgiven if they think Brute Force has all-male cast. That having been said, the women in the lives of the convicts do appear by way of flashbacks. Ann Blyth plays Joe's wife Ruth, who needs an operation for cancer. It is Ruth's illness that largely fuels Joe's desire to escape. Robert (Howard Duff) recalls Gina, a woman in Italy for whom he stole food from the Army.  When her father goes to turn Robert into the military police, she kills him. Naturally, Robert takes the blame for the killing. Tom's (Whit Bissell) wife (Ella Raines) is his excuse as to why he is in prison. She wanted a mink coat, so he cooked the books at work. Spencer's (John Hoyt) mind goes back to a con artist, Flossie (Anita Colby), who robs Spencer at gun point and then steals his car. Given Ella Raines and Anita Colby's characters, the portrayal of women in Brute Force is to some degree misogynistic, but then such misogyny is hardly alien to film noir. What sets Brute Force apart from other film noirs, aside from its setting, is that it is an overly violent film for its era. Wilson (James O'Rear), one of the prison's snitches, is killed in a steel press in the workshop. Munsey beats a prisoner who is strapped to a chair. The violence of the climactic fight between Joe and Captain Munsey was such it ran afoul of the MPAA Production Code Administration. Even by today's standards, the violence in Brute Force can be shocking at times.To a degree Brute Force seems dated (particularly in its portrayal of women), it remains a harrowing film about prison life in the Forties. It remains a hard-hitting critique of the prison system as it was at the time."},
{"title": "\"Born to Raise Hell\" by Cheap Trick", "date": "Sunday, November 21, 2021", "text": "\"Born to Raise Hell\" was one of four songs written by Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick and performed by Cheap Trick for the classic, Canadian animated feature film Rock & Rule (1983). Like the other Cheap Trick songs from Rock & Rule, it would remain unreleased until it appeared on the 1996 boxed set Sex, America, Cheap Trick. It was one of my favourite Cheap Trick songs. It also happens to one of their angriest. Sadly, \"Born to Raise Hell\" has also fit my mood the past few days."},
{"title": "Broken Arrow the TV Series", "date": "Friday, November 19, 2021", "text": "Native Americans did not fare well during the Golden Age of Hollywood. They did not fare particularly well in the early days of television either. Indeed, the most familiar Native American character to television viewers in the Fifties was probably The Lone Ranger's sidekick Tonto, who was something of a stereotype. Fortunately, things began to change in the late Forties with more sympathetic portrayals of Native Americans in films. Among the films with a more sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans was Broken Arrow (1950). It was the success of Broken Arrow (1950) that would lead to the television series Broken Arrow, one of two shows in the Fifties that centred on a Native American character (the other being Brave Eagle).The movie Broken Arrow (1950) was based on the 1947 novel Blood Brother by Elliott Arnold. Like the novel, the movie was a fictionalized account of the friendship between Indian agent Tom Jeffords(James Stewart)  and  Chiricahua Apache chief Cochise (Jeff Chandler). While Cochise was played by a white actor (as were the other Native characters, with the exception of Geronimo, played by Jay Silverheels) , the movie was progressive for its time insofar as it presented a sympathetic view of both Cochise and the Apache. Not only was Broken Arrow nominated for three Oscars, but it also did very well at the box office. It was the eighth highest grossing film for 1950.It was in 1955 that The 20th Century Fox Hour debuted on CBS. The 20th Century Fox Hour aired hour-long adaptation of 20th Century Fox movies. Among these movies was Broken Arrow, starring Ricardo Montalbán as Cochise and John Lupton as Tom Jeffords, which aired on May 2 1956. It was this episode of The 20th Century Fox Hour that led to the TV series Broken Arrow. Like the movie and the 20th Century Fox Hour before it, Cochise was once more played by someone who was not Native American. Michael Ansara was a Syrian American of Lebanese descent. Broken Arrow was not the first time he had played a Native American. He had played The Prophet in the 1952 Western Brave Warrior.  On television he had played a Native character on The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin. For the role of Tom Jeffords, Broken Arrow retained John Lupton from the 20th Century Fox Hour episode. Broken Arrow debuted on ABC on September 25 1956. It benefited from a particularly good time slot, following the hit Westerns Cheyenne (which rotated with the anthology show Conflict) and The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp at 9:00 PM Eastern/8:00 PM Central. It then did well enough in the ratings to be renewed for a second season. That second season would be its last. Broken Arrow was rerun on ABC from April to September 1959 as a summer replacement series.As stated earlier, Broken Arrow was a [progressive show for its time. Its Native American characters were treated sympathetically and they did not speak in the stereotypical broken English seen on many other Westerns. The first three episodes more or less followed the plot of the 1950 movie. For the most part the villains were corrupt white men. An exception to this rule was Geronimo, who appears as Cochise's opponent in a few episodes. Even as Cochise's opponent, Geronimo was treated sympathetically.Of course, Broken Arrow is a product of its time. Like the movie, to a degree it offers a romanticized,  idealized view of Native Americans. If the show does not cling entirely to the noble savage stereotype, it comes close. A greater objection to the show is that the Native American characters are not played by Native American actors. Sadly, this would remain the norm well into the Sixties.Broken Arrow would not be the last time Michael Ansara played a Native American. During the 1959-1960 season on the TV show Law of the Plainsman, he played U.S. Marshal Sam Buckhart, an Apache who was educated at Harvard after saving the life of a U.S. Cavalry officer. Although it might be better remembered than Broken Arrow, it only lasted one season.Broken Arrow is not a well-remembered show, but it is a significant one as the one of the first to present a sympathetic view of Native Americans, as well as one of the first to feature a Native American character as one of the leads."},
{"title": "\"California Dreamin'\" by The Mamas and the Papas", "date": "Thursday, November 18, 2021", "text": "Among my favourite songs by The Mamas and the Papas is \"California Dreamin'.\" The song was written by John and Michelle Phillips in 1963 when they were still living in New York City and John Phillips was a member of the folk trio The Journeymen. The inspiration for the song came from the winter of 1963 in New York City, which was a particularly cold and brutal one. Michelle Phillips, who was born in Long Beach, California and had spent much of her life in the Los Angeles area, particularly missed California. The song, in which an individual finds himself longing for LA during a particularly bitter winter back East, is then to a degree autobiographical. I have only been to Los Angeles once, but those few days I spent there are enough to make me miss the city at times. It is for that reason I do identify with the song to a degree. That having been said, it comes to my the most not in the winter, but instead in the summer. I tend to miss the somewhat drier, milder summer in Los Angeles when it is overly hot and muggy here! Of course, this means I have to change the lyrics to \"California Dreamin'\" a bit in my head when I listen to it in the summer.Without further ado, here are The Mamas and the Papas with \"California Dreamin'.\""},
{"title": "Smoke Signals (1998)", "date": "Wednesday, November 17, 2021", "text": "Hollywood has not exactly been kind to Native Americans. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, Native American characters appeared almost exclusively in Westerns (Key Largo was an exception).  To make matters worse, Native Americans were almost always played by white men, and the portrayals were more often than not outright stereotypes. While Hollywood still has a long way to go in its treatment of Natives, things have improved somewhat in the past few decades. The movies Powwow Highway (1989) and Smoke Signals (1998) featured Native Americans in modern day settings and as full-fledged characters rather than stereotypes. What is more, the characters were played by Native Americans.Indeed, Smoke Signals is singularly important in the history of Native Americans on film. It was the very first film to be written, directed, and co-produced by Native Americans. It remains one of the few films with a primarily Native American cast. While Native Americans had directed films before (James Young Deer and Edwin Carewe in the early years of American film), Smoke Signals was historic in the extent to which Native Americans were involved in its production. Smoke Signals centres on two young  Coeur D'Alene Indians, Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams). Victor is handsome and athletic, if a bit angry at life and his circumstances. Thomas is an eccentric storyteller committed to the traditions of the Coeur D'Alene. The two grew up together, but do not always get along due to the difference in their personalities. When Victor's father Arnold (Gary Farmer) dies in Phoenix, Arizona, Victor and Thomas make a road trip form the Coeur D'Alene Indian Reservation to bring back his ashes. The trip proves to be filled with self-discovery for both young men. Smoke Signals was based on the short story \"This is What it Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona\" by Sherman Alexie from his book  The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven. Director Chris Eyre had read the book and contacted Sherman Alexie about the film rights. While others had approached Mr. Alexie about the film rights before, he gave his consent to Mr. Eyre as he wanted the first film adaptation of his work to be directed by a Native American. While Chris Eyre directed Smoke Signals, it was Sherman Alexie who wrote the film's screenplaySmoke Signals was developed through the Native American and Indigenous Program at the Sundance Institute. The Sundance Institute was founded by Hollywood heavyweight Robert Redford to support independent filmmakers. The Native American Indigenous Program was started in 1994. Given it was developed through the Sundance Institute, it should come as no surprise that Smoke Signals premiered on January 16 1998 at the Sundance Film Festival. At the Sundance Film Festival Smoke Signals took away two trophies and was nominated for another. It won the Filmmaker's Trophy and the Audience Award. It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize. Smoke Signals  would win many more awards. Smoke Signals also received good reviews and what is more, it did respectably well at the box office for an independent film. Of course, Smoke Signals would not have had nearly as much impact had it not been a good film. Fortunately, it is a great film. Much of this is due to the cast. Both Adam Beach and Evan Adams give fantastic performances as Victor and Thomas respectively. Irene Bedard is remarkable as Suzy Song, a friend of Victor's father Arnold. All of the performances in the film are first rate, and the fact that Native American characters are played by Native American actors gives the film an authenticity it might not have had otherwise.While the performances in the film are great, much of what makes Smoke Signals a superior film is its script. Smoke Signals subverts several Native American stereotypes. The phrase, \"It's a good day to die,\" long associated, rightly or wrongly, with Native Americans is toyed with throughout the film. At one point Thomas remarks, \"Sometimes it's a good day to die, and sometimes it's a good day to have breakfast.\" Randy Peone, the DJ on the reservation's radio station KREZ, says on the radio, \"It's a good day to be indigenous!\" Thomas and Victor discuss which historical Native Americans would have been good at basketball and even create a song about John Wayne's teeth (which they maintain are never visible). Smoke Signals also deals with such issues as domestic violence, alcoholism, child abandonment, and the sometimes dysfunctional relationships between fathers and sons. Smoke Signals is historic with regards to Native Americans on film, it can be enjoyed as a coming of age movie by individuals of any ethnicity. It is by turns funny, touching, and even tragic, but it is always entertaining."},

{"title": "Godspeed Graeme Edge of The Moody Blues", "date": "Friday, November 12, 2021", "text": "Graeme Edge, The Moody Blues' drummer for the entirety of their history, died yesterday, November 11 2021, at the age of 80.Graeme Edge was born on March 30 1941 in Rocester, Staffordshire. When he was only about six months old his family moved to Birmingham. His mother played piano as accompaniment to silent movies. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all sang in music halls. He had originally planned to become a draughtsman, although he managed a group called the Blue Rhythm Band. When the Blue Rhythm Band's drummer quit, Graeme Edge would up playing drums for the group for three weeks until they got a new drummer. Graeme Edge formed the band The Silhouettes. He later co-founded Gerry Levene and The Avengers. Gerry Levene and The Avengers recorded one single for Decca, \"Dr. Feelgood\"/\"It’s Driving Me Wild.\" The group also appeared on the British TV show Thank Your Lucky Stars. It was after Gary Levene and The Avengers broke up that Graham Edge formed The R&B Preachers, which included future Moody Blues members Denny Laine and Clint Warwick. After The R & B Preachers broke up, Messrs. Edge, Laine, and Warwick formed the M & B 5 with Ray Thomas. The M & B 5 were soon renamed The Moody Blues. The Moody Blues signed with Decca Records in 1964. Their second single, \"Go Now,\" was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Unfortunately, following singles did not perform as well. In 1966 Clint Warwick not only left the band, but the music business entirely. Later in the year Denny Laine also left. It was in late 1966 that John Lodge and Justin Hayward joined the band, establishing the classic line-up of The Moody Blues. The Moody Blues would release a series of success albums, including Days of Future Past, In Search of the Lost Chord, On the Threshold of a Dream, A Question of Balance, To Our Children's Children,. Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, and Seventh Sojourn. As a poet, Graeme Edge provided the poems  \"Morning Glory\" and \"Late Lament\" for Days of Future Past, \"Departure\" and \"The Word\" for In Search of the Lost Chord, \"In the Beginning\" and \"The Dream\" for On the Threshold of a Dream, and others. He also contributed songs, such as \"Higher and Higher\" on To Our Children's Children.In 1974 The Moody Blues took an extended break. Graeme Edge then formed the Graeme Edge Band. The Graeme Edge Band released two albums: Kick Off Your Muddy Blues in 1975 and Paradise Ballroom in 1977. The Moody Blues reformed in 1978. The band returned with the album Octave, to which Graeme Edge contributed \"I'll Be Level with You.\" The Moody Blues released several more albums. Graeme Edge contributed such songs as \"22,000 Days\" to Long Distance Voyager, \"Going Nowhere\" to The Present, and \"Nothing Changes\" to Strange Times. In the Eighties he worked from time to time with the jazz combo Loud, Confident and Rong. As a drummer Graeme Edge was very precise. He was also versatile, He went from the R&B influenced sound of the early Moody Blues to the progressive rock sound of the band's later years. In addition to drums he also provided The Moody Blues with a variety of percussion instruments, including tambourine and timpani. He even occasionally played piano. On top of being an excellent drummer, he was also a great poet, even reciting his own poems from time to time. \"Morning Glory\" and \"Late Lament\" remain highlights of Days of Future Past. It seems likely that The Moody Blues would not have been as successful as they were without Graeme Edge."},
{"title": "The Late Great Lee Gordon of KRCG", "date": "Thursday, November 11, 2021", "text": "If you live in the Columbia/Jefferson City, Missouri television market and you are anything older than a Zoomer, chances are good that you remember Lee Gordon. Lee Gordon worked for the Jefferson City station KRCG in various capacities for 53 years. It would not surprise me if he worked longer in the Columbia-Jefferson City market than any other on-air personality. Sadly, Lee Gordon died Tuesday, November 9, at the age of 85. The cause was complications of pulmonary disease.Lee Gordon was born in Jefferson City and had deep roots in the capital city. An elementary school in Jefferson City is even named for his uncle, Thorpe Gordon. Lee Gordon was taking drama classes at Jefferson Junior College when KRCG was hiring a part-time announcer for the station. He began work at KRCG in April 1955, only a few weeks after the station had opened in February 1955. Mr. Gordon had only been working at KRCG when the station's full-time announcer quit. KRCG then offered him the job and he took it. It was early in KRCG's history that he was the anchor for the station's 10:00 PM newscast, as well as its announcer for commercials. In 1956 he began his long stint as a weathercaster at the station. Lee Gordon also worked behind the scenes. In the days when KRCG produced a good deal of local programming, Lee Gordon directed many of those live local TV shows. In the days before ABC affiliate KCBJ (now KMIZ) opened in 1971, KRCG and Columbia station KOMU would divide up ABC programming between the two stations. It was Lee Gordon who chose which ABC shows would air on KRCG, everything from The Big Valley to The Johnny Cash Show. He served as KRCG's program manager and eventually its station manager.Aside from his long stint as a weatherman on KRCG, many viewers might remember him best for playing Santa Claus on the station's long running children's show Showtime in the weeks before Christmas. He is also remembered as KRCG's horror host, The Count, on the station's horror movie anthology Tales of Terror in the early to mid Seventies. Tales of Terror included reruns of the classic TV series Thriller and such classic horror movies as Son of Frankenstein  (1939) and The Mummy (1932). Lee Gordon retired in 2008 after having worked for KRCG for 53 years. Over the years he had offers to work in bigger markets, but KRCG would also match any offers that were made. Eventually he was content to remain with KRCG and continue living in Fulton, where he raised his family.Having grown up in mid-Missouri I have very fond memories of Lee Gordon. He was one of the best on-air personalities to ever work in this market, both as an anchorman and a weatherman. He had an incredible, deep voice that was perfect not only for announcing, but for his roles as Santa Claus and The Count. He had a long career with KRCG, seeing television evolve from analog technology to digital technology. Both because of the length of his career and his talent as an on-air personality, Lee Gordon will remain one of the best remembered people to work in the Columba/Jefferson City television market."},

He will also be remembered as the rather creepy Ben, who lip syncs to Roy Orbison's \"In Dreams\" in Blue Velvet. That having been said, he played many more roles throughout his career. He was Edmund, the younger son who may have tuberculosis, in Long Day's Journey into Night. He played Howard Hughes in Tucker: The Man and His Dream. From the attorney Bob Grimes in To Live and Die in L.A. to a mob boss in Married to the Mob, Dean Stockwell played many different roles. What is more he always gave a good performance."},
{"title": "He  Walked By Night (1948)", "date": "Monday, November 8, 2021", "text": "The film movement known as film noir emerged in the 1940s. It was from film noir movement that the genre of the police procedural emerged. The late Forties saw a number of police procedural movies released, including T-Men (1947), The Naked City (1948), The Street with No Name (1948), and Mystery Street (1950). These police procedurals were shot in a semidocumentary style and focused on the procedure of law enforcement as they investigated a case. Among the best of the police procedurals released in the late Forties was He Walked By Night (1948). He Walked By Night centred on Roy Morgan (Richard Basehart), a former radio technician for a local police department turned thief who has shot a Los Angeles Police patrolman when he was nearly caught during his burglaries. He Walked By Night was inspired by the real life case of Erwin \"Machine Gun\" Walker, a former Glendale, California police radio operator and dispatcher who committed a spree of burglaries in Los Angeles County in 1945 and 1946. He engaged in more than one shoot out with law enforcement. The film had the working titles of 29 Clues and The L.A. Investigator before finally being titled He Walked by Night. While Alfred L. Werker is credited as the director on He Walked by Night, most film scholars believe that Anthony Mann took over for Mr. Werker fairly early in the shooting of the film. To wit, He Walked by Night was shot in a semidocumentary style similar to Anthony Mann's earlier film T-Men and his later film Border Incident (1949). John Alton was the cinematographer on He Walked By Night. Not only had worked with Anthony Mann on T-Men and would work with him on Raw Deal (1948) and Border Incident, but he would become well-known for his work in film noir. In addition to Anthony Mann's films, John Alton also worked on such classic film noirs as Reign of Terror (1949), Mystery Street, and The Big Combo (1955). He Walked by Night featured some of John Alton's work, particularly the climax of the film shot in the storm drains of Los Angeles.In addition to Anthony Mann's direction and John Alton's cinematography, He Walked by Night benefits from a strong script by John C. Higgins and Crane Wilbur, as well as the performances of the cast. Richard Basehart is chilling as Roy Morgan, the master criminal terrorizing Los Angeles County. Scott Brady and James Cardwell do a good job playing the police sergeants investigating the case, Marty Brennan and Chuck Jones. He Walked By Night proved to be an influential film noir in more ways the one. In the movie Jack Webb played a forensics expert named Lee. He became friends with the police technical advisor on the film, Los Angles Police Detective Sergeant Marty Wynn. It was Jack Webb's discussions with Sgt. Marty Wynn that convinced him that police procedure could be realistically portrayed on a regularly scheduled radio show. This led to the radio show Dragnet. It debuted on 1949 and proved to be a huge hit. It made the transition to television in 1951.He Walked By Night won the special prize for Best Police Film at the Locarno International Film Festival in 1949. It also received largely positive reviews and did very well at the box office. He Walked by Night would also have lasting impact through its bare bones approach to the police procedural. It was a direct inspiration for the radio show and television series Dragnet and, as a result, its influence can be felt on police procedurals to this day. Even the film's action sequences, particularly its climax, would have a lasting impact on both film and television. While He Walked by Night may not be as famous as Double Indemnity (1944) or The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), but there is every reason it should be."},

The cause was complications from a stroke.JoAnna Cameron was born on September 20 1948 in Vail, Colorado. In college she befriended Bob Hope's daughter Linda Hope. Bob Hope then cast her in the role of his character's daughter in the movie How to Commit Marriage (1969). In the late Sixties this led to guest appearances on TV shows The Bold Ones: The New Doctors, Medical Center, Daniel Boone, and The Name of the Game. She appeared three times as Nurse Anne McAndrews on Marcus Welby M.D. She appeared in the TV movie The Last of the Powerbrokers. She also appeared in the movie I Love My Wife (1970). In 1975 she cast in the role of Andrea Thomas on Isis. Andrea Thomas had an ancient Egyptian amulet that would transform her into the superhero Isis, who had power over the elements and animals. The series ran for two seasons on Saturday morning on CBS and was then repeated for another season. Miss Cameron also guest starred on the shows Love, American Style; The Partners; Search; Columbo; Shazam! (as Isis); McMillan & Wife; Gibbsville; The Amazing Spider-Man; and Switch.

After she left the entertainment industry she worked in home healthcare as a nurse and later in marketing for various hotels.The Secrets of Isis was historic as the first TV show centred on a female superhero, pre-dating The Bionic Woman by four months and Wonder Woman by seven months. In this way it paved away for further TV shows featuring superheroines. JoAnna Cameron was perfect in the role, giving a sincere performance and remaining convincing as both science teacher Andrea Thomas and superheroine Isis. The character made an impression, and remains remembered to this day. This was largely due to JoAnna Cameron's performance."},

{"title": "The Baby Snooks Show: \"Halloween\" (1946)", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2021", "text": "Many, perhaps most, radio shows in the days of Old Time Radio had Halloween episodes. Indeed, The Jack Benny Program very nearly had one every year. The Baby Snooks Show, starring comedienne Fanny Brice as the title character, was among the many shows that had Halloween episodes. Indeed, the November 1 1946 episode \"Halloween\" is significant as one of the earliest references to trick or treating in popular culture.Baby Snooks was a mischievous toddler created by Fanny Brice. Fanny Brice first played Baby Snooks on vaudeville, drawing inspiration for the name from George McManus's comic strip The Newlyweds, which featured an infant named Baby Snookums. She would later draw inspiration from the popular child star Baby Peggy. First appearing in a successful series of shorts starting in 1921, Miss Brice transformed Baby Snooks into a caricature of Baby Peggy. It was in 1934 that Fanny Brice began appearing as Baby Snooks in The Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway. Baby Snooks made her radio debut in 1936 on The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air. The following year Fanny Brice (then 46 years old) played Baby Snooks in the film Everybody Sings (1937).  Starting in 1938 she occasionally appeared on the radio show Good News of 1938. In 1940 Baby Snooks was a regular on Maxwell House Coffee Time.It was in 1944 that Baby Snooks received her own radio show. The Baby Snooks Show starred Fanny Brice as Baby Snooks, who lives with her parents, Lanhcelot \"Daddy\" Higgins (played by Hanley Stafford) and Vera \"Mommy\" Higgins (played by Arlene Harris by the time of the 1946 Halloween episode). While Baby Snooks was essentially a good kid at heart, she had a rather impish sense for mischief, often driving Daddy up the wall. In \"Halloween\" Baby Snooks is doing exactly that. As the episode starts, Baby Snooks wants to go out trick or treating with her friends. Unfortunately, Daddy won't let her as a doctor for the life insurance will be dropping by to examine him and he wants peace and quiet lest his blood pressure goes up. While Daddy is trying to rest, Baby Snooks gets on his nerves until he finally lets her go out trick or treating. It is then that Daddy dons a mask with huge tusks to scare the kids and teach them a lesson about running about and wreaking havoc on the streets. Unfortunately, Daddy's plan backfires when one of the fathers of Baby Snooks's friends takes offence at him scaring the kids, resulting in the two fathers pulling a series of pranks on each other that escalate in their outrageousness. Of interest to those fascinated by the history of Halloween is the scene in which Baby Snooks and her friends are trick or treating. Here it must be pointed out that trick or treating was a relatively recent development. It had originated in Canada in the late Twenties and then spread throughout the United States in the 1930s. It is for that reason that one does not begin to see references to the custom until the 1940s. As odd as it might seem today, The Baby Snooks Show episode \"Halloween\" is then one of the earliest references to trick or treating in popular culture. In \"Halloween\"Baby Snooks and her friends trick or treat at announcer Harlow Wilcox's house. Mr. Wilcox gives the kids a treat of Jell-O. If that seems like an odd treat for Halloween, keep in mind that Jell-O was the show's sponsor and the scene is effectively a commercial for the product.The Baby Snooks Show episode \"Halloween\" is a lot of fun, with Daddy's pranks growing more and more outrageous as the episode progresses. As might be expected, his pranks don't always work out as intended. Over all, it is an enjoyable listen any time around Halloween."},
{"title": "The 30th Anniversary of the TV Movie Locked Up: A Mother's Rage", "date": "Friday, October 29, 2021", "text": "Vanessa Marquez and Cheryl LaddIt was thirty years ago today, October 29 1991, that the television movie Locked Up: A Mother's Rage debuted on The CBS Tuesday Movie. The movie centred on a single mother of three children, Annie Gallagher (Cheryl Ladd), who is wrongly convicted of selling drugs and sent to prison for 15 years. Her sister Cathy was played by Jean Smart, who must take care of Annie's children while she is locked up. Locked Up: A Mother's Rage follows Annie's adjustment to life in prison and the impact it had on her children. As to why I would be writing about a thirty year old television movie, it starred my dear friend Vanessa Marquez in one of her earliest major roles. She played Yolanda, nicknamed \"Yo-Yo,\" who was sent to prison for killing her abusive boyfriend, apparently in self defence.Locked Up: A Mother's Rage was based on the documentary They're Doing My Time (1988), directed by Patricia Foulkrod. They're Doing My Time centred on the plight of children whose mothers have been sent to prison. They're Doing my Time  aired on PBS in July 1989.  In fact, the original title of Locked Up: A Mothers Rage was the same as the documentary, They're Doing My Time. While Locked Up: A Mother's Rage was inspired by the documentary They're Doing My Time and even begins with the prerequisite \"Based on a True Story,\" it is in many ways a typical of TV movies of the era. The script takes a simplistic approach to the social problems it is tackling, with some things presented in purely black and white. Indeed, such complicated topics as motherhood and incarceration are reduced to their simplest terms. And while Locked Up: A Mother's Rage is supposed to have been \"based on a true story,\" the subplot involving Cathy's marital difficulties seem unrealistic, especially given its resolution. At times some of the characters seem to act with no reason other than it is required of the plot.That Locked Up: A Mother's Rage is a rather typical TV movie of the Nineties is even exemplified by the performances of its two leads. Both Cheryl Ladd and Jean Smart's performances are sincere, but they are overwrought in a way that most performances in 1990s TV movies tended to be. Similarly, the performances of the actors playing Annie's children also tend to be over the top. While the film's script and the performances of its two leads might dissuade one from watching Locked Up: A Mother's Rage, the performances of its supporting players make it worth watching.  Angela Bassett did a good job of portraying Willie, an inmate who is initially unfriendly to Annie but eventually befriends her. Diana Muldaur does well as Frances \"the Quaker Lady,\" a social worker seeking to help the inmates. One of the best performances is given by Kimberly Scott, who plays Sherisse. Sherisse is in charge of the prison library and helps Annie in her fight to be released. As to my dear Vanessa Marquez, she also gives one of the best performances in the film. Her role as Yo-Yo could not have been an easy one to play, particularly given what she's goes through in the film, but Vanessa made Yo-Yo and the subplot dedicated to her believable.Locked Up: A Mother's Rage was repeated on July 19 1992 on The CBS Sunday Movie. For the remainder of the Nineties, like many made-for-TV movies \"based on a true story,\" it would be rerun on the cable channel Lifetime. Locked Up: A Mother's Rage was released on DVD in the mid-Naughts, although for some strange reason it was retitled The Other Side of Love. It is under that title that today it can be found on some streaming services. Personally, I think the original title was better, particularly given The Other Side of Love has nothing to do with the film's plot. Locked Up: A Mother's Rage is a rather typical made-for-TV movie from the 1990s, overwrought and tending to oversimplify many of the issues it addresses. That having been said, it is worth watching for the performances of the supporting cast. And while I might be biased, it is worth for Vanessa Marquez's performance as Yo-Yo, one of her earliest and best roles."},
{"title": "The Woman Who Came Back (1945)", "date": "Thursday, October 28, 2021", "text": "As hard as it might be to believe, prior to the Seventies horror movies rarely mentioned Halloween. In fact, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, comedies, such as The Boy Friend (1939), Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), and Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), referenced Halloween more often than horror movies. One horror movie made during the Golden Age that referenced Halloween was The Woman Who Came Back (1945). Even though it was made in the mid-Forties, The Woman Who Came Back was one of the earliest horror movies to mention the holiday.In The Woman Who Came Back Lorna Webster (Nancy Kelly) is returning to her home town of Eben Rock on the night of Halloween. She is descended from Judge Elijah Webster, a notorious witch-hunter who had several women burned at the stake for witchcraft. She is sleeping on the bus when an old woman boards it in the middle of nowhere. The old woman claims that she is one of the witches hanged by Elijah Webster. She further claims that she made a deal with the Devil so that when she dies her spirit will enter the body of a young woman over the course of 300 years. The bus on which Lorna is riding crashes and she is the only survivor. While recovering in Eben Rock she begins to suspect that the spirit of the old witch has entered her. Worse yet, after a series of strange incidents, the residents of Eben Rock tend to believe this too. Only the local minister, Reverend Jim Stevens (Otto Kruger) and her love interest, Dr. Matt Adams (John Loder), believe otherwise.In the mid-Forties movies about witchcraft and diabolism became somewhat fashionable. In 1942 I Married a Witch took a humorous look at witchcraft. Val Lewton's The Seventh Victim (1943) centred on a Satanic cult. In the horror movie Weird Woman (1944) based on Fritz Leiber's novel Conjure Wife, a professor's wife is suspected of being a witch. Given the release of movies about witchcraft or diabolism, it should come as no surprise that Republic Pictures made The Woman Who Came Back. Republic Pictures was not particularly known for the quality of its horror movies. Some examples of Republic's horror movies are The Lady and the Monster (1944) and The Catman of Paris (1946), neither of which are particularly respected. While Republic Pictures was not known for quality horror movies, The Woman Who Came Back is the exception. In fact, it could very nearly be a Val Lewton movie save for the fact that Val Lewton did not produce it. Like Mr. Lewton's movies, The Woman Who Came Back relies more upon the power of suggestion and the film's atmosphere than anything graphic. Like Val Lewton's films, The Woman Who Came Back has a deliberate pace that allows the suspense in the film to build and build. If the movie has one flaw, it is in its ending, which goes to a bit too much effort to explain everything. One has to suspect Val Lewton would have given it a more ambiguous ending.The Woman Who Came Back benefits from a capable cast. Nancy Kelly, who would later play the mother of the title character in The Bad Seed (1956), is very convincing as Lorna as the character's hysteria gradually grows throughout the movie. Veteran character actor Otto Kruger is great as Reverend Stevens, the voice of reason in the small town of Eben Rock. John Loder is also quite good.While Halloween does not play an overly large role in The Woman Who Came Back, given the era it is significant that the holiday is mentioned at all. Halloween certainly adds weight to the idea that Lorna may be a witch given the bus crash takes place on the holiday. When Lorna arrives at the tavern in town following the bus crash, there are children dressed in costumes. Given how rarely Halloween was mentioned in horror movies prior to the Seventies, even the small role Halloween plays in The Woman Who Came Back is notable.I would recommend The Woman Who Came Back to anyone who enjoys 1940s horror movies, particularly those made by Val Lewton. It is a remarkable film put out by a studio not often known for the quality of its horror movies."},
{"title": "Halloween is Grinch Night", "date": "Wednesday, October 27, 2021", "text": "While animated Halloween television specials were common from the late Seventies into the Eighties, there was a time when they were virtually unknown on American television. As hard as it may be to believe, It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, which debuted in 1966, was the first animated Halloween special. When Halloween is Grinch Night debuted in 1977, it was then one of the earliest animated Halloween specials in the history of American television history.Halloween is Grinch Night was based on the well-known character created by Dr. Seuss and its teleplay was written by Dr. Seuss as well. Although it is sometimes referred to as a sequel to How the Grinch Stole Christmas, it was intended as a prequel to that special. Indeed, in Halloween is Grinch Night, it is clear that the Grinch's heart has yet to grow three sizes. In Halloween is Grinch Night, a Sour-Sweet Wind descends upon Whoville. This causes the Whos to take refuge in their homes, as they know the wind means the Grinch will be in a bad mood. And indeed he is. The Grinch descends upon Whoville to wreak havoc, only to be confronted by a young Who named Eukariah.While Halloween is Grinch Night was a prequel to How the Grinch Stole Christmas, it was made by a different production company. How the Grinch Made Christmas was made by Cat in the Hat Productions in conjunction with MGM. It was directed by Chuck Jones. Staring with The Cat in the Hat in 1971, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises began producing a series of animated specials based on the works of Dr. Seuss. Halloween is Grinch Night was directed by Gerard Baldwin, who had earlier directed several episodes of the Jay Ward television series Rocky and His Friends and George of the Jungle. Halloween is Grinch Night was also broadcast on another network than the previous Dr. Seuss specials. Starting with How the Grinch Stole Christmas, every single Dr. Seuss special had aired on CBS. Halloween is Grinch Night was the first of several Dr. Seuss specials to air on ABC.Halloween is Grinch Night would also have a slightly different cast from How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Boris Karloff, who provided the original voice of the Grinch, had died February 2 1969. Hans Conried then provided the voice of the Grinch in Halloween is Grinch Night. While Dallas McKennon provided the voice of the Grinch's dog Max in How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Henry Gibson provided his voice in Halloween is Grinch Night. Returning from How the Grinch Stole Christmas was singer Thurl Ravenscroft, who provided vocals on the songs. While many of the Dr. Seuss animated specials were based on specific Dr. Seuss books, Halloween is Grinch Night was not. It was instead an original work. That is not to say that it did not draw upon some of Dr. Seuss's books. The howling Hakken-Kraks come from Dr. Seuss's book Oh, the Places You'll Go!. A landscape of tall mushrooms was drawn from the book Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!. Other imagery from the special also resembles that found in yet other Dr. Seuss's books. Despite its title, Halloween is never specifically mentioned in Halloween is Grinch Night. This could be the reason that when released on VHS the special was re-titled It's Grinch Night or simply Grinch Night. That having been said, Grinch Night would seem to be the Who's equivalent of Halloween. It takes place when the Sour-Sweet Wind arrives. Of course, Halloween marks the beginning of colder weather in some parts of the United States. Furthermore, the use of the imagery of ghosts and monsters by Grinch to try to scare the Whos would indicate that Grinch Night is similar to Halloween.Halloween is Grinch Night won the Emmy for Oustanding Children's Program. That having been said, it would not repeat the success of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. It would be repeated regularly on ABC in the late Seventies and Eighties. In the Nineties it would enter syndication.Halloween is Grinch Night may not have been as successful as How the Grinch Stole Christmas, but it is fondly remembered by many Gen Xers and older Millennials. It was the second work in any medium to feature the Grinch and one of the earliest animated Halloween specials."},
{"title": "Halloween Ads From the Past", "date": "Tuesday, October 26, 2021", "text": "Given how much of a role trick or treating plays in the modern day celebration of Halloween, most people probably think of ads for candy when they think of the holiday. As the celebration of Halloween grew in the 20th Century, companies would capitalize on Halloween to advertise products that I doubt many would associate with the day. Here are a few ads from the past for products that really wouldn't seem to have much to do with Halloween.Hot dogs are not the first food to come to mind when it comes to Halloween, but for a portion of the 20th Century certain people wanted them to be. In the 1940s makers of Skinless Frankfurthers or Wieners created their own mascot, the Weeny Witch, and then spent a few decades trying to convince people to incorporate hot dogs into their Halloween celebrations. In some ads they even encouraged Halloween games involving hot dogs, such as \"bobbing for franks...\"This ad for Lucky Strike cigarettes not only incorporates Halloween imagery in the form of a jack o'lantern, but references to the U.S. Navy football team and encourages people to buy U.S. Defence Bonds.Like cigarettes, beer is not exactly something one necessarily associates with Halloween. That didn't stop Schlitz from including Halloween imagery in this 1956 ad.Coffee is not necessarily associated with Halloween either. Regardless, this ad for Chase & Sanborn Instant Coffee from 1956 uses Halloween imagery.Here is an ad for Royal Crown Cola (also known as RC Cola) from 1961."},
{"title": "Halloween Apples", "date": "Monday, October 25, 2021", "text": "Apples have long been linked to Halloween. Games using apples, such as apple bobbing, are often played on the holiday. Candy apples and caramel apples are often served as treats during the holiday. There are few fruits more associated with Halloween than the apple.Of course, this makes sense. In both Europe and North America, September marks the height of the apple harvest, so that they would be readily available in October. And while there is not substantial evidence that apples played a role in the Celtic festival called in Modern Irish Samhain and in Scottish Gaelic Saimhainn, its status in Celtic mythology makes it quite possible that it did. A silver apple branch plays a role in both the Irish poem Imram Bran and the Irish narrative Echtra Cormaic. Among the many myths about the king of Munster Cú Roí is that after he was killed by Cú Chulainn, his soul is hidden in an apple in the stomach of a salmon living in a stream in the Slieve Mish Mountains. Among the mythical islands of Irish mythology is Emain Ablach, which has been interpreted as \"Island of the Apples\" by some. There are several other Irish myths including apples, so it seems quite possible that apples played a role in the Celtic pagan festival of Samhain and hence traditions regarding apples made their way into the Christian holiday of Halloween.One claim on how apples became tied to Halloween that seems unlikely is that Romans in Britain brought the worship of Pomona, the goddess of fruit trees and orchard,  and her festival influenced the festival of Samhain or Samhainn. This seems highly unlikely. First, it must be considered that Pomona was honoured in conjunction with her consort Vertumnus at the festival Vertumnalia around August 13, about a month and a half before the Celtic festival of Samhain. Second, it must also be considered the most of our traditions regarding Halloween come from Scotland with some in put from Ireland. The Romans never conquered, let alone occupied what would become known as Scotland or Ireland. It then seems likely that the worship of Pomona was unknown in Pagan Scotland and Pagan Ireland.  If apples are a significant part of Halloween, it seems likely that it is because they were significant to the Celts whose holiday of Samhain may have influenced many Halloween traditions.Regardless, apples would play a part in games played at Halloween, perhaps the best known of which is bobbing for apples, known as \"dooking\" in Scotland and \"apple ducking\" or \"duck-apple\" in Northern England. Like many traditions observed at Halloween, apple bobbing appears to have originally been divinatory in nature. According to the most basic variation on apple bobbing, the first person to bite into an apple would be the first to marry. In another variation, the names of unmarried persons would either be carved into the apples or written on a piece of paper attached to the apples stems. Biting into an apple would then reveal the name of the person one was meant to marry. Of course, as time wore on, apple bobbing would simply be performed for fun, and it would cease to be divinatory in nature.Another bit of fortune telling involving apples that was performed at Halloween was the counting of apple seeds. An apple was cut in two  and its core removed. The number of seeds would then foretell the coming year. The meaning between any given seeds tended to vary from place to place, but an example is that one seed meant one would be lonely, two seeds meant that one would marry, and so on.A potentially more dangerous game than apple bobbing or counting apple seeds was Snap-Apple. In one variation of the game, an apple was placed at one end of a stick and a lit candle at the other end. The stick was then suspended from its middle and twirled. The goal of the blindfolded players was to bite into the apple while avoiding biting into the candle. A much safer version of Snap-Apple involved simply attached apples to strings and then the blindfolded players would try to bite into them. At one time Snap-Apple was significant enough that in some places Halloween was called \"Snap-Apple Night.\"Of course, apples have always been consumed at Halloween. Curiously, candy apples are a relatively recent development. It was in 1908 that at Christmastime candy maker William Kolb was trying out various recipes in  his shop. It occurred to him to dip apples into cinnamon candy boiling on a stove. William Kolb sold the candy apples in his shop and they proved to be a hit. While he originally made them at Christmas, they would become associated with Halloween.It is quote possible today that caramel apples are better known than candy apples. And while caramel apples were certainly developed after candy apples, it is difficult to say when. The 1920 edition of the book Rigby's Reliable Candy Teacher includes a recipe in which apples were dipped in a mixture of Molasses Taffy and other ingredients. While not exactly the same as caramel apples, it would be quite similar. It seems possible that at some point some candy maker simply substituted caramel for molasses taffy. Regardless, it was in 1948 that Affy Taple out of Chicago offered its first caramel apple. It was in the 1950s that Dan Walker of Kraft Food developed his own method of creating caramel apples while experimenting with caramel candy left over from Halloween. While Affy Taple's claim to the caramel apple pre-dates Kraft's claim, Kraft did provided individuals at home with an easy way of making their own caramel apples. Regardless, it was in 1960 that Vito Raimondi of Chicago invented the first automated caramel apple machine.Apples have played a significant role at Halloween for centuries, so much so that they form part of the popular culture surrounding the holiday. Irish artist Daniel Maclise's painting \"Snap-Apple Night\" from 1933 portrays apple bobbing. In Agatha Christie's novel Hallowe'en Party, a young woman is drowned in an apple bobbing tub. There is also a scene involving apple bobbing in the classic animated television special It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. Candy apples and caramel apples are still treats to be enjoyed at Halloween. Whatever the origins of the fruit's link to the holiday, it is safe to say people will be enjoying apples at Halloween for years to come."},
{"title": "The Apple TV+ Who Stole Halloween", "date": "Sunday, October 24, 2021", "text": "Among the earliest and most Halloween specials is beloved as It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. In fact, it could well be the most popular Peanuts special, even more so than A Charlie Brown Christmas. The special was a hit upon its debut on October 27 1966 on CBS and has remained popular ever since. Sadly, for the first time in 55 years, It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown did not air on broadcast television.It was in October 2020, not long before It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown usually aired, that Apple TV+ obtained exclusive rights to the Peanuts specials and thereafter they would only be available on that platform. It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown would be available to Apple TV+ subscribers any time while it would be available free to non-subscribers from October 30 to November 1 2020. The outrage on the part of fans of the Peanuts special was no small matter. While defenders of Apple pointed out that It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown would be available free on Apple TV+ for three days, Apple's critics pointed out that not only would individuals have to install Apple TV+ on their televisions, phones, tablets, or computers, but they would have to create an account to do so. Yet others pointed that not every family has access to the high speed internet that makes streaming media possible. Many Peanuts fans were angry that it broke with tradition. It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown is perhaps the only Halloween special to have aired every single year since its debut. Indeed, one of the biggest arguments against It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown not airing on broadcast television is that 2020 may well have been the year we needed it the most. 2020 was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when most people did not go out as they used to. In times of trouble people often seek out TV shows, movies, and so on that are familiar to them as a source of comfort. As beloved as It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown is, there were no doubt many who were looking forward to watching it in 2020, particularly given their children might not be able to go trick or treating due to the pandemic. Whether Apple TV+ intended to or not, they effectively stole Halloween from many.Ultimately, It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown did not air on broadcast television in 2020, the first time since it had debuted in 1966. Fortunately, the widespread outrage would put an end to Apple TV+'s plan to make the Peanuts specials exclusive to that platform. It was announced in November 2020 that a deal had been struck so that both A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving and A Charlie Brown Christmas would air once each on PBS. This year It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown airs on PBS as well. In fact, it airs tonight at 6:30 PM Central Time. Aside from the general cluelessness of Corporate American and the fact that broadcast television apparently still has a place in American's lives, last year's outrage at Apple TV+ over preventing It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown demonstrates just how beloved the special really is. These days television shows sometimes move exclusively to streaming services with little being said, but the anger at It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown not airing last year was great indeed. It perhaps serves as an object lesson for corporations not to mess with certain traditions."},
{"title": "Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965)", "date": "Saturday, October 23, 2021", "text": "(This post is part of the Third Great Hammer-Amicus Blogathon hosted by Realweegiemidget Reviews and Cinematic Catharsis)Much to the irritation of fans of Hammer Films and Amicus Productions, the two studios are sometimes confused by the uninitiated. While the movies of both studios boasted a similar visual style and shared many of the same stars, there are some notable differences between the two. Most of Hammer's horror films were set at some time in the past, whether it was the 18th Century or the Victorian Era. Most of Amicus's films were set in the present. Further setting the two apart was the fact that most of Amicus's horror movies were portmanteau films. That is, they were anthology films in which various stories were all united by a single wraparound story. The first of Amicus Productions' many portmanteau horror movies was Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965).In Dr. Terror's House of Horrors architect Jim Dawson (Neil McCallum), Bill Rogers (Alan Freeman), jazz musician Biff Bailey (Roy Castle), art critic Franklyn Marsh (Christopher Lee), and Dr. Bob Carroll (Donald Sutherland) each enter a train carriage. They are joined by Dr. Schreck (Peter Cushing), whose last name translates literally into \"terror\" in English. Dr. Schreck is a doctor of metaphysics and he has with him a tarot deck, which he refers to as his \"house of horrors.\" To pass the time, he does a tarot reading for each of the men in the carriage with him, these readings providing the stories in the movies. As might be expected, these are horror stories, featuring everything from a werewolf to a sentient, creeping vine.Amicus Productions was founded in 1962 by American movie producers Milton Subotsky and Max Rosenberg. The company's first two films were the pop musicals It's Trad, Dad (1962) and Just for Fun (1963). Despite this, Milton Subotsky and Max Rosenberg were no strangers to horror. Prior to founding Amicus Productions, the two men had worked together on the horror movie The City of the Dead (1960). Furthermore, they had planned to shoot Dr. Terror's House of Horrors in black and white in 1962, with Columbia Pictures providing financial backing. Columbia decided that the movie's $94,000 price tag (low even in 1962) was too much and pulled out of the project. It took two years for Milton Subotsky and Max Rosenberg to raise the money needed to make Dr. Terror's House of Horrors, which would now be shot in glorious Technicolor. The inspiration for Dr. Terror's House of Horrors was the classic British horror portmanteau film Dead of Night (1945). Milton Subotsky had always admired the film and thought \"..the time was ripe for another film like it.\" The stories in Dr. Terror's House of Horrors were drawn from five half hour scripts Milton Subostsky had written for the television version of the classic radio show Lights Out in 1948. Since the stories were not used for the TV show, Milton Subostky simply recycled them for his screenplay and wrote the framing story featuring Dr. Schreck to tie them together. Much of the source of confusion with regards to Hammer Films and Amicus Productions is that the two companies often used the same actors. Indeed, Dr. Terror's House of Horrors features Hammer's two best known stars, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. In the various stories it also features other veterans of Hammer Films. Harold Lang, who appears in the segment \"Creeping Vine,\" had appeared in several Hammer movies, including Cloudburst (1951), Wings of Danger (1952), The Saint's Return (1953), The Men of Sherwood Forest (1954), The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), and Paranoiac (1963). Michael Gough, who plays Christopher Lee's nemesis in the segment \"Disembodied Hand,\" will be familiar to Hammer fans as Arthur Holmwood in Dracula (1958) and Ambrose D'Arcy from The Phantom of the Opera (1962). While some of the members of the cast of Dr. Terror's House of Horrors had not yet appeared in a Hammer movie, they eventually would. Bernard Lee, best known as M in the James Bond movies, would appear in Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974). Dr. Terror's House of Horrors was very well received. In its March 3 1965 review, Variety wrote of the film, \"Five short horror episodes, thinly linked, provide a usefully chilly package deal which offer audiences several mild shudders and quite a bit of amusement...\" Robert Salmaggi of The New York Herald Tribune commented \"..that each scary adventure will keep you watching, sitting on the edge of your seats one second, laughing the next (there are some deft touches of humour) and all in all, nicely entertained.\" Dr. Terror's House of Horrors also did very well at the box office on both sides of the Atlantic. It should be little wonder that Amicus would follow it with even more portmanteau horror movies over the years.Indeed, Dr.Terror's House of Horrors is a very well done movie. Much of this is because of the various performances in the film. Peter Cushing is fittingly mysterious as Dr. Schreck (the \"Dr. Terror\" of the title). Christopher Lee is excellent in a role unlike those with which viewers are most familiar, playing a a smug art critic. Donald Sutherland excels in one of his earliest roles, playing a physician a bit of his depth. Of course, a good deal of credit must also go to Milton Subostsky's script. He deftly blends both horror and humour, so that Dr. Terror's House of Horrors is by turns frightening and funny. One of the best bits of humour is even meta in nature. In the segment \"Voodoo\" Roy Castle runs straight into a poster for, you guessed it, Dr. Terror's House of Horrors.Dr. Terror's House of Horrors would set the pace for Amicus for the rest of its history. Over the years Amicus would follow it up with such portmanteau horror movies as Torture Garden (1967), The House That Dripped Blood (1971), Tales from the Crypt (1972), and Asylum (1972). And while it was the first of Amicus Productions' many horror anthologies, it also remains one of their best."},
{"title": "Cloudburst (1951)", "date": "Friday, October 22, 2021", "text": "(This post is part of the Third Great Hammer-Amicus Blogathon hosted by Realweegiemidget Reviews and Cinematic Catharsis)While Hammer Films is best known for the highly successful horror movies they released from the late Fifties into the Seventies, the company had existed for many years before the release of The Curse of Frankenstein in 1957. Before they found success with the horror genre, Hammer had seen some success with crime thrillers and film noirs. Starting in 1951, Hammer Film released such crime dramas as The Black Widow (1951), The Dark Light (1951), and The Last Page (1952). Among the most historically important of these crime thrillers released by Hammer in the early Fifties is Cloudburst (1951).Cloudburst centres on cryptographer and a former Special Operations Executive agent John Graham (Robert Preston). When his wife (Elizabeth Sellars) is killed by a hit-and-run driver, Graham uses the skills he learned in the SOE during World War II to exact revenge. Cloudburst was based on a play written by Leo Marks, today best known as the screenwriter of the classic Peeping Tom (1960). To a degree Cloudburst was inspired by Mr. Marks's own life. During World War II he worked as a cryptographer for the SOE on Baker Street in London. He would later write the book Between Silk and Cyanide: A Codemaker's Story 1941–1945 (published in 1998) based on his experiences as a cryptographer. It seems possible that even the hit-and-run death of John Graham's wife could have some basis in Leo Marks's life. During World War II he fell in love with a young woman named Ruth Hambro. Sadly, Miss Hambro would be killed in an airplane crash in 1943. While they were never formally in a romantic relationship (Mr. Marks was too shy to tell her how he felt), she served as the inspiration for one of his best known poems, \"The Life That I Have.\" Beyond Ruth Hambro, Leo Marks also had female friends who were also fellow SOE agents who died during the war. Both Violette Szabo and Noor Inayat Khan, with whom Mr. Marks worked and was close, were killed by the Nazis. If John Graham's grief and rage in Cloudburst seems genuine, it seems possible that it is because Leo Marks had experienced them himself.Cloudburst was Hammer's first real attempt to break into the American market. It was co-produced by Hammer Films' own Anthony Hinds and Hungarian American producer Alexander Paal. It was Alexander Paal who brought Robert Preston onto the project. Mr. Paal paid 75% of Mr. Preston's fee and even his living expenses while in London in return for 75% of the film's distribution rights in the Western Hemisphere. Originally Eagle-Lion Films was set to distribute Cloudburst in the United States, but the company ceased operations before the film's release. Cloudburst was then distributed by United Artists in the United States.In many respects as the first American co-production Cloudburst marked as great a shift for Hammer Films as The Curse of Frankenstein six years later. Robert Preston would not be the last American leading man cast in a Hammer movie, as the studio would do so repeatedly in following years in an effort to attract American audiences. It was following the release of Cloudburst that Hammer Films would sign a four-year production and distribution with Robert Lippert of Lippert Pictures. Essentially, Lippert Pictures would distribute Hammer Films in the United States and Hammer Films would distribute Lippert Pictures in the United Kingdom. Such films as Stolen Face (1952), Wings of Danger (1952), and The Last Page would be released under this agreement.Aside from being one of Hammer's earliest attempts to break into the American market, it was also historic as the first Hammer movie to be filmed at Bray Studios, where such classics as The Curse of Frankenstein, Dracula (1958), and The Mummy (1959) were filmed. Bray Studios was originally Down Place, a private residence built in the 1750s. The house was vacated in the 20th Century and eventually fell into disrepair. Hammer Films shot portions of their film The Dark Light at Down Place. In need of a studio, Hammer bought Down Place and remodelled it as a movie studio. Cloudburst stands out among Hammer's pre-horror films. The film presents the grief and anger at the death of a loved one in a way that few movies had done before. This is aided by the performance of Robert Preston,whose John Graham is about as far from the congenial Harold Hill of The Music Man as one can get. John Graham is a man consumed by the grief over his wife and the anger at her needless death. In any other film Graham might have been presented as a villain, but in Cloudburst  he comes off sympathetically, making it one of the earliest Hammer Films to do away with conventional morality. Indeed, Cloudburst is not light, popcorn fare. In their review of the film, the critic at Harrison's Reports wrote of the film, \"Most picture-goers probably will find it too grim for enjoyment.\" Cloudburst was a historic film for Hammer Films in many respects. It was their first American co-production and the first to be shot at Bray Studios. It set the pace for many Hammer movies to come, even once the studio shifted more towards the horror genre. Not particularly well known today, it deserves to be better known."},
{"title": "A Brief History of Halloween Decorations", "date": "Thursday, October 21, 2021", "text": "This year it is estimated that Americans will spend a record $10 billion on Halloween candy, decorations, and costumes. As hard as it might be to believe, this was not always the case. Not only is trick or treating a relatively recent development, but so too is decorating for Halloween. In fact, while trick or treating emerged in the late 1920s and the 1930s, decorating the outside of one's house for Halloween wouldn't really emerge until the late 20th Century.Halloween was brought to the United States by Scottish immigrants in the 19th Century, and initially it was celebrated only in Scottish American and Irish American communities. By the late 1880s the celebration had started to spread beyond these communities. By the 1900s Halloween was being celebrated so widely across the United States that commercially produced Halloween decorations finally became available. At the time Halloween was a holiday primarily celebrated by adults, so the earliest Halloween decorations differed a bit from many of those available now. First, they were meant for indoor use only. Outdoor Halloween decorations had not yet been introduced. If for whatever reason one wanted to decorate the outdoors for Halloween, they would have likely used such home-made Halloween decorations as jack o'lanterns or scarecrows. Second, the earliest Halloween decorations were made of paper and were expected to be disposable. They were not necessarily meant to be used year after year.Initially these paper Halloween decorations were largely manufactured in Germany, but American companies would get in on the action soon enough. Dennison Manufacturing Company was a manufacturer of paper products founded in 1844. It was in the 1900s that they began manufacturing paper Halloween decorations. In fact, their decorations would prove so popular that in 1909 they published their first Dennison's Bogie Book for Halloween. A new edition would be published in 1912. Except for years of World War I, Dennison's Bogie Book for Halloween would be published annually until 1934. A Beistle joined skeleton Dennison was by no means the only manufacturer of paper Halloween decorations in the United States. The Beistle  Company was founded in 1900. It was in 1920 that they first started making paper Halloween decorations. Their decorations proved so popular that by 1928 Beistle was even making games for Halloween. It was in the 1930s that the Beistle Company introduced one of their most popular items, a jointed skeleton. Over the years The Beistle Company made many of the Halloween decorations seen in classrooms across the United States. What is more, the Beistle Company still exists to this day and is still owned by the Beistle family. They are now the oldest continuing manufacturer or party goods and seasonal decorations in the United States.It would the introduction of a new custom called trick or treating in the late Twenties that would largely change the character of Halloween in the United States. The first reference to trick or treating is in the November 4 1927 issue of the Herald (published in Lethbridge, Alberta) in the article \"'Trick or Treat' is the Demand.\" Trick or treating appears to have spread from Canada to the western United States and then moved eastwards. By the late Thirties kids were trick or treating across the country.  Celebrated primarily by adults at the start of the 20th Century, trick or treating transformed Halloween into a holiday celebrated by children. Decorating for Halloween began to take off several years after the end of World War II, largely due to a new technology. Blow molding is a process through which one can create hollow shapes made of plastic. The basic principles behind blow molding comes from glassblowing, a process which has existed for centuries.  It was in 1938 that Enoch Ferngren and William Kopitke created a blow molding machine, which they then sold to to Hartford Empire Company in 1938. Products manufactured using blow molding remained limited until various advances were made in the technology. Blow molding then finally began to take off in the Fifties.A 1968 Empire Jack o'lantern bucketwith flashlight inside It was the introduction of the pink flamingo in 1957 that spurred the popularity of blow mold decorations. Don Featherstone was hired by Union Products Inc. to create three-dimensional, blow mold decorations in the shape of animals. His second assignment was to create a blow mold flamingo. The pink flamingo proved extremely popular with families in the late Fifties and spurred the popularity of blow mold decorations in general. Seasonal blow mold decorations emerged in the wake of the pink flamingo, including Christmas decorations introduced in the late Fifties. Several companies took advantage of the blow mold craze sweeping the nation, including Empire Plastics Inc.,  Bernard Edward Co. (later called Beco), Poloron Products, Dapo, General Foam, and many others.It was in the early to mid-Sixties that blow mold Halloween decorations emerged. Among the most popular were blow mold trick or treat buckets, but by the end of the decade there was a wide variety of blow mold Halloween decorations. Jack o' lanterns, haunted houses, ghosts, and other decorations were being manufactured by the late Sixties. The outdoor decorations (and even some indoor decorations) almost always included a light inside, so that they could be seen at night. Blow mold Halloween decorations remained popular through the Eighties, although gradually they would being to decline in popularity. That having been said, in the 2020s they seem to be making a comeback. An inflatable jack o' lantern It was the dawn of the 21st Century that saw the introduction of yet another sort of seasonal decoration. The novelty company Gemmy Industries had been founded in 1984. It was in August 2000 that they conceived a new sort of outdoor Christmas decoration. Their idea was an eight foot, inflatable Santa Claus. It was with this Santa Claus that Gemmy launched their Airblown Inflatables line in 2001. Their inflatable Santa Claus would be followed by other Christmas decorations, as well as Halloween decorations. Gemmy's Airblown Inflatables would prove to be popular in the 2000s, so that other companies followed them into the manufacture of inflatable decorations. A wide variety of Halloween decorations were and still are being produced. Inflatables of jack o'lanterns, ghosts, skeletons, witches, and other figures associated with Halloween have been made, as have inflatables associated with such licensed properties as The Nightmare Before Christmas, Disney, Scooby Doo, and others. While inflatables declined a bit in popularity in the Teens, they can still be seen around the country every year around Halloween.Halloween decorations have evolved over the years. Paper decorations of the sort manufactured by Beistle have remained popular for indoor decorations over the years. Blow mold decorations became wildly popular from the Sixties to the Eighties and then declined in popularity, but appear to be making a comeback. Inflatables aren't as popular as they once were, but could one day make a comeback. One thing is for certain. People probably won't ever stop decorating for Halloween."},
{"title": "The Late Great Betty Lynn", "date": "Sunday, October 17, 2021", "text": "Of the cast of The Andy Griffith Show, perhaps no one was as beloved as Betty Lynn. For six years she played Barney Fife's one true love, Thelma Lou. In 1990 she started taking part in reunions of the cast of The Andy Griffith Show and various festivals devoted to the show around the country. She regularly attended Mayberry Days in Mount Airy, North Carolina. In 2007 she moved to Mount Airy, and she regularly met fans at The Andy Griffith Museum there. Of course, before she played Thelma Lou on The Andy Griffith Show, Betty Lynn had a movie career during which she appeared opposite such big names as Bette Davis, Loretta Young, Maureen O'Hara, and Myrna Loy. She also made numerous guest appearances, particularly on television Westerns. Sadly, Betty Lynn died yesterday at the age of 95 after a brief illness.Elizabeth Ann Theresa Lynn was born on August 29 1926 in Kansas City, Missouri. Her mother was a mezzo-soprano who had performed with the Chicago Opera. Her mother and father divorced while Betty Lynn was still young, and the father figure in her life was her grandfather, George Andrew Lynn. She was only five years old when her mother enrolled her in the Kansas City Observatory of Music. As a teenager she sang in supper clubs and on radio. It was when she was 17 years old that USO scouts discovered her in Kansas City. It was then after she turned 18 that she began performing for USO Camp Shows in the United States. As part of the USO she was one of the first to visit newly released American prisoners of war in a Calcutta hospital. During  her USO career she travelled throughout China, Burma, and India. After her service in the USO, Betty Lynn appeared on Broadway as Sylvie in the musical Oklahoma!. It was while she appearing the pre-Broadway try-outs for the musical Park Avenue that she was spotted by a 20th Century Fox talent scout. She made her film debut as Ginger in Sitting Pretty (1948). In the late Forties she appeared in such films as Apartment for Peggy (1948), June Bride (1948), Mother is a Freshman (1949), Father Was a Fullback (1949), and Cheaper By the Dozen (1950). In the Fifties she made her television debut in a guest appearance on Schlitz Playhouse in 1951. She had a recurring role on The Egg and I in 1952. She was a regular on the sitcom Where's Raymond?, starring Ray Bolger. She made several guest appearances on Matinee Theatre. She also guest starred on the shows Revlon Mirror Theatre, The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, Studio 57, Fireside Theatre, Your Playtime, TV Reader's Digest, Cavalcade of America, Sally, The Gale Storm Show, M Squad, Lawman, Wagon Train, Bronco, Sugarfoot, Markham, Tales of Wells Fargo, Mike Hammer, and National Velvet. Betty Lynn appeared in the movies Payment on Demand (1951), Take Care of My Girl (1951), Many Rivers to Cross (1955), Meet Me in Las Vegas (1956), Behind the High Wall (1956), Gun for a Coward (1956), The Hangman (1959), and The Louisiana Hussy (1959). It was in 1961, late in the first season of The Andy Griffith Show, that Betty Lynn first played Thelma Lou. Initially it was not planned for Thelma Lou to be Barney Fife's regular girlfriend, but the character proved popular. As a result Betty Lynn was brought back multiple times to play Thelma Lou until Barney and Thelma's romance was an established part of the show. At the same time that Betty Lynn was appearing as Thelma Lou on The Andy Griffith Show, she was also appearing as Viola Slaughter on a series of episodes on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Colour devoted to Texas John Slaughter. In fact, at the time she was cast as Thelma Lou on The Andy Griffith Show, she was under contract to Disney. Later in the decade Miss Lee, Bill David's secretary on Family Affair, and Janet Dawson, Steve Douglas's secretary on My Three Sons. She also guest starred on the shows The Farmer's Daughter, The Smothers Brother's Show, and The Mod Squad.In the Seventies Betty Lynn guest starred on the TV shows The Smith Family, The Mod Squad, Little House on the Prairie, Police Story, Gibbsville, and Barnaby Jones. In the Eighties she reprised the role of Thelma Lou in the television movie Return to Mayberry, on which Barney and Thelma Lou finally got married. She played Sarah, Ben Matlock's secretary, on four episodes of the first season of Andy Griffith's TV series Matlock. She guest starred on the TV show Shades of LA.It is likely that Betty Lynn will always be best remembered as Thelma Lou on The Andy Griffith Show. Thelma Lou was in many ways the perfect girlfriend for the sometimes fickle Barney Fife. She was intelligent, sweet, and patient, but willing to put her foot down where Barney was concerned when she needed to (which was fairly often, in all actuality). Betty Lynn did a wonderful job of bringing Thelma Lou to life. Of course, during her career Betty Lynn played many other roles. In the movie June Bride, she played Barbara \"Boo\" Brinker, the younger sister in love with her older sister's fiancé.In Mother Is a Freshman, she played the daughter of the mother of the title, who enrolls in college. Of course, Betty Lynn also played Viola Slaughter, the wife of Texas John Slaughter, on the Disney series. Of course, in may ways it should be little wonder that Betty Lynn did so well at playing Thelma Lou, as in real life Betty Lynn was known for her sweetness and kindness. She loved her fans and they loved her back. She was known for remembering fans she had met and even their names years after she had met them. Fans who met her always remarked on her kindness, her generosity, and her positivity. Bette Davis, with whom she worked on June Bride and with whom she was close friends, once advised Betty Lynn to be more selfish if she wanted to be a star. Betty Lynn proved Bette Davis wrong. Betty Lynn never became more selfish, remaining the sweet, bright woman she always was, and still became a star."},

{"title": "The 70th Anniversary of I Love Lucy", "date": "Friday, October 15, 2021", "text": "I Love Lucy was not the first situation comedy. The format had originated on radio in the 1920s. It was not even the first television sitcom. That was Mary Kay and Johnny, which debuted in 1947. I Love Lucy was not the first filmed sitcom to be shot using a multiple-camera setup. Other sitcoms had used it earlier, including Amos 'n' Andy. That having been said, I Love Lucy is possibly the most influential situation comedy of all time. It was American television's first megahit in the genre. It was the first sitcom to be filmed in front of a live television audience with a multiple-camera setup, a format still in use to this day. It was also the first American television show to feature a multiethnic marriage and one of the earliest to have a character's pregnancy written into the show. I Love Lucy continues to be popular, and it remains in syndication to this day, as well as widely available on streaming services. I Love Lucy debuted seventy years ago today, on October 15 1951. The origins of I Love Lucy can be traced back to the radio show My Favorite Husband, on which Lucille Ball starred. On the show Lucille Ball played Liz Cooper, a housewife known for her wild schemes. Her husband was banker George Cooper, played by Richard Denning. At the time that My Favorite Husband debuted in 1948, Lucille Ball was already a popular movie actress with a career stretching back to the Thirties. My Favorite Husband proved to be a hit, so that by 1950 CBS wanted to bring the show to television. While CBS wanted Richard Denning to play her husband on the television version of My Favorite Husband, Lucille Ball insisted that her husband on the television version be played by her real-life husband Desi Arnaz. CBS did not believe that the audience would believe in a multiethnic marriage. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's response was to create a vaudeville act to prove CBS wrong. The vaudeville act was written by Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr., who had written My Favorite Husband along with Jess Oppenheimer. A company, Desilu Productions, was formed to produce the vaudeville act and subsequent television show. It was the success of the vaudeville act that convinced CBS executive Harry Ackerman that a show starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz could be successful. It probably helped  good deal that Lucille Ball's idea for a new show had generated interest at CBS's archrival NBC. With the prospect of losing Miss Ball to NBC, Harry Ackerman eventually gave into Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's wishes. The result was I Love Lucy.For those unfamiliar with I Love Lucy, the show centred on housewife Lucy Ricardo and her husband, upcoming Cuban bandleader Ricky Ricardo. The two lived in an apartment in New York City, which they rented from their neighbours Ethel and Fred Mertz. Many of the show's plots rotated around Lucy's efforts to break into show business, often as part of Ricky's act. Lucy and Ethel often concocted various schemes together. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were not the only people to work on I Love Lucy with roots in Hollywood. William Frawley, who played Fred Mertz, had steady work as a character actor in movies, including his famous appearance in Miracle on 34th Street (1947). The show's cinematographer Karl Freund had begun working in film in Europe and later migrated to the United States. Dracula (1931), The Good Earth (1937), for which he won an Oscar, and Key Largo (1948) the films he had shot. He also directed movies, including the classics The Mummy (1932) and Mad Love (1935). Even the original opening had been created by well-known talents with roots in Hollywood. The show's animated opening featured Lucy and Ricky as stick figures. It was created by legendary animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Because the two men were still under contract to MGM, they refused any on-screen credit. An argument can be made that the animated opening of I Love Lucy was one of the many ways in which the show was influential. Several sitcoms in the Fifties and Sixties would have animated openings, including Date with the Angels, The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, Pete and Gladys, Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie, and others. Sadly, the original animated opening of I Love Lucy would be replaced by the more familiar \"heart on satin\" credits for the repeats of the show aired on CBS from 1959 to 1967 and subsequently in syndication. The originated animated openings would not be seen again until 2001, when for the show's 50th anniversary TV Land had the animated opening restored (although in such a way as to edit out original sponsor Philip Morris). I Love Lucy proved to be a huge hit for CBS. In its first season it ranked no. 3 in the Nielsen ratings for the year. By its second season it was the number one show on television. When it ended is turn after six seasons, it was still the number one show on television, one of the few shows (along with The Andy Griffith Show and Seinfeld) to end its show as such. As mentioned earlier, when Lucille Ball was pregnant with Desi Arnaz Jr., the pregnancy was written into the shows. This was not the first instance in which a pregnancy had been written into a show, as it had been written into the plot of Mary Kay and Johnny, the first American television sitcom, several years earlier. CBS was nervous about using the word \"pregnant,\" so the word \"expecting\" was used instead. The episode in which Lucy gives birth to Little Ricky, \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital,\" proved to be the highest rated episode of a show aired up to that time. Aside from the birth of Little Ricky, I Love Lucy would change in other ways over the years. Ricky Ricardo began the show as the bandleader at the Tropicana club. Over time he bought the club and renamed it the Club Babalu. For the second half of the show's sixth and final season, the Ricardos, as well as the Mertzes, moved from New York City to the suburb of Westport, Connecticut.After six seasons, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz had tired of producing a weekly television series. As mentioned above, the show was still the number one show when it left the air. It is for that reason that CBS began reran I Love Lucy from 1959 to 1967. The show itself continued after a fashion as a series of hour-long specials titled  The Ford Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show in its first season and subsequently  Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse Presents The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show (so named because it aired in the timeslot of Desilu's anthology series, Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse). A total of 13 hour-long specials aired from 1957 to 1960. Sadly, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's marriage had been crumbling for some time, and tension between the two rose over time. It was for this reason, as much of anything, that the hour-long specials came to an end.Of course, this was hardly the end of I Love Lucy. CBS would rerun the show in the daytime starting in 1959 and would continue to do so until 1967. It would then enter syndication where it has remained ever since. The show can be seen on multiple streaming services.It is perhaps impossible to entirely assess how great the influence of I Love Lucy has been on American television. While it was not the first show to be shot using a multiple-camera setup, the fact that it did so may well have popularized that particular method of shooting television shows. It was the first sitcom to be shot in front of a live audience, something else that has persisted through the years. I Love Lucy certainly popularized the genre of the sitcom. It was the first megahit in the genre and its success would lead to the success of other shows in the genre.An argument can also be made that it was I Love Lucy that led to CBS dominating Monday nights for literally years. With I Love Lucy on Monday night, CBS was able to build a powerhouse lineup around the show. The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts, and December Bride all ranked in the upper reaches of the Nielsen ratings. Even after I Love Lucy had ended, CBS would continue to dominate Monday night with such shows as The Danny Thomas Show, The Andy Griffith Show, The Lucy Show, Family Affair, and others. In fact, CBS would dominate Monday nights well into the Seventies.Of course, what might possibly be the biggest impact that I Love Lucy had on American television could be the fact that Desilu Productions had been created to produce it. Desilu would become one of the most successful television production companies in the history of American television producing such classics as Our Miss Brooks, December Bride, The Untouchables, Star Trek, Mission: Impossible, and Mannix. I Love Lucy also led to lasting success for Lucille Ball. While Lucille Ball never ranked among the upper echelon of movies stars, she was a popular actress in the Thirties and Forties. That having been said, it was I Love Lucy that turned Lucille Ball into a superstar. Following I Love Lucy, she would have two more successful sitcoms: The Lucy Show and Here's Lucy. On its seventieth anniversary I Love Lucy is still as popular as ever. It still airs on syndication and can be found on a number of streaming outlets. A colourized version of the show's Christmas episode (\"The I Love Lucy Christmas Show\") that has been rerun in recent years by CBS consistently receives high ratings. I Love Lucy was one of the most popular shows of the 1950s. It remains one of the most popular shows of all time."},
{"title": "Godspeed David DePatie", "date": "Thursday, October 14, 2021", "text": "David DePatie, the last producer at the Warner Brothers Cartoons and the co-founder of DePatie-Freleng Enterprises with Friz Freleng, died on September 23 2021 at the age of 91.David DePatie was born on December 24 1929 in Los Angeles. His father was Edmond L. DePatie, who would later become vice president and general manager of Warner Bros. Burbank studio. David DePatie followed his father's footsteps in becoming a Warner Bros. employee. It was in 1961 that he became production executive at Warner Bros. Cartoons. In addition to the theatrical shorts Warner Bros. was still producing, Mr. DePatie also oversaw the production of the long running Bugs Bunny Show, as well as the live-action pilot Philbert (starring William Schallert). It was in 1963 that the Warner Bros. animation division was closed down. It was then that David DePatie formed Depatie-Freleng Enterprises with animator Friz Freleng. Among the company's earliest works were commercials starring Charlie the Tuna for StarKist. Blake Edwards approached the fledgeling animation studio about creating the title sequence for his 1964 movie The Pink Panther. The titles for The Pink Panther were so successful that United Artists then had Depatie-Freleng Enterprises produce a theatrical short featuring the pink panther from the movie's titles. \"The Pink Phink\" proved successful and won an Academy Award. It would lead to 123 more animated shorts starring The Pink Panther.Depatie-Freleng Enterprises also produced other series of animated shorts, including \"The Inspector,\" \"The Ant and the Aardvark,\" \"The Texas Toads,\" and others. From 1964 to 1966 Warner Bros. outsourced the production of theatrical shorts to Depatie-Freleng Enterprises. They also created the title sequences of several classic television shows, including I Dream of Jeannie and The Wild Wild West, as well as such movies as The Great Race (1965) and How to Murder Your Wife (1965). In 1966 Depatie-Freleng Enterprises began producing television cartoons for Saturday morning, the first of which was The Super 6. Over the years they produced such animated television series as The Pink Panther Show, Return to the Planet of the Apes, and Baggy Pants and the Nitwits. They also produced television specials, the best known of which were a series of Dr. Seuss inspired specials, beginning with The Cat in the Hat in 1971.In 1981 David DePatie and Friz Freleng sold DePatie-Freleng Enterprises to Marvel Comics, where it was renamed Marvel Productions. Friz Freleng returned to Warner Bros. (who had reopened their animation division), while David DePatie became the head of Marvel Productions. He remained with Marvel Productions until 1984. He served as producer on the Hanna-Barbera animated series Pink Panther and Sons before retiring.As a producer David DePatie was responsible for a good deal of classic animation, from the \"Pink Panther\" theatrical shorts to the title sequences of movies and TV shows to several television specials. At Warner Bros. he oversaw the creation of The Bugs Bunny Show and the production of the last theatrical sorts the studio would make for years. He may well have been one of the last great animation producers following the Golden Age of Animation."},

{"title": "Four Ways Twitter Can Be Improved", "date": "Saturday, October 9, 2021", "text": "It was in 2019 that Twitter rolled out a new redesign. At the time Twitter claimed the redesign is \"...a refreshed and updated website that is faster, easier to navigate and more personalized.\" They also claimed that \"Easy Access to Your Favourite Features.\" To say Twitter users disagreed would be an understatement. Most of them seemed to detest the new design. In the little over two years since the redesign was introduced things have calmed down, but I think one will still find many Twitter users who hate the 2019 design. I know I am one of them. While there have been a few improvements to the redesign since its introduction, I think Twitter could make even more improvements that would make new users more likely to stick around and would please long time users like myself.Return the Menu to the Top of the Web Version of TwitterFor most of its history, the menu for the web version was at the top. This made perfect sense, as it was easily accessible. Both the mobile version of Twitter and the Twitter mobile app have a menu at the bottom. Again, it is easily accessibly. For some reason known only to its designers, the current web version of Twitter has the menu on a left-hand sidebar. Worse yet, it is more difficult to reach some of Twitter's features on this left-hand sidebar than it was the old top menu. For instance, to reach Moments one has to click on More at the bottom of the sidebar. Now I never have used Moments, but I do know of people who did. It seems to me, then, that Twitter should not only return the Menu to the top, but return it to the way it was before the redesign. It would be much easier to use and much more accessible.Give Users the Ability to Disable the Algorithm Sorted Feed in SettingsIn 2016 Twitter introduced an algorithm sorted feed that it then called \"Best Tweets.\" At the time one could simply disable it by going into settings. As a result, many, perhaps most, Twitter users went about their business reading tweets in reverse chronological order as always. Unfortunately with the 2019 redesign the algorithm sorted feed was renamed \"Home\" and one had to click stars in the upper right hand corner to switch to \"Latest Tweets (the original feed in reverse chronological order). This would prove to be an annoyance, as when returning to Twitter one might find their Twitter feed switched to the algorithm sorted feed (which Twitter calls \"Home\") and would have to switch it back again. That problem has since been fixed, but if one logs out of Twitter or clears one's cookies in their browser, they will find themselves on the algorithm sorted feed again. Given many, perhaps most, Twitter users prefer the Latest Tweets feed, it seems to me it would be a good idea for Twitter to give users a way to disable the algorithm sorted feed in settings like we used to have. The plain truth is that when I visit Twitter I do not want to see tweets that some algorithm has determined I am interested in. I want to see the most recent tweets. This is particularly important when live tweeting movies or TV shows. Indeed, if Twitter had been sorted by algorithm from the beginning, I have to think the phenomenon of live tweeting would never have arisen. Of course, another solution would be for Twitter to do away with the algorithm sorted feed entirely. I doubt very many would miss it.Do Away with \"What's Happening\"It was not long after the 2019 redesign was introduced that the Trends sidebar with the What's Happening sidebar. The What's Happening sidebar usually contains news stories and a few trending topics. Quite frankly, I want the Trends sidebar back. As far as I am concerned, What's Happening is useless. Most of the news stories I see on What's Happening I have absolutely no interest in. I would much rather see what is trending on Twitter the way I used to. What I then propose is that Twitter either do away with the What's Happening sidebar entirely or, at least, give users the choice of replacing it with the old Trends sidebar. Either way, I know I would be much happier.Twitter Should Giver Users a Means of Hiding \"Topics to Follow\"The ability to follow specific topics on Twitter is another thing that was introduced not long after the 2019 redesign. Essentially, when one follows a Topic, tweets relevant to that Topic will show up in one's feed. Of course, for this to happen one must be using the algorithm sorted feed (the one Twitter insists on calling \"Home\") rather than the Latest Tweets feed. For those of us who always use the Latest Tweets feed, then, Topics are meaningless. Unfortunately, when viewing one's own profile or someone else's profile, a block of \"Topics to Follow\" will show up in the middle of the feed. I find this annoying as I have absolutely no interest in following Topics on Twitter. Given I use the Latest Tweets feed exclusively, it would be useless for me to follow any Topics at all. Twitter should then give users a means of hiding Topics to Follow and never seeing them again.Twitter is my second favourite social media service after the late, lamented Google+. Unfortunately, I do not enjoy it as much as I did before the 2019 redesign and it is precisely because they moved the menu, replaced the Trends sidebar with \"What's Happening,\" and insist on forcing Topics on me. To be honest, I think Twitter would be better off ditching the 2019 redesign entirely and returning to the old design. I know I wouldn't alone in being happy about that."},
{"title": "Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It (2021)", "date": "Friday, October 8, 2021", "text": "Many actors are referred to as legends, but in Rita Moreno's case even the word \"legend\" seems like an understatement. She was a trailblazer with regards to Latina actresses, overcoming stereotypes to carve out a career for herself. In the Fifties, Sixties, and Seventies she was one of the few Latinas to be seen on both the big scree and TV screen. Along with Mike Nichols and Barbara Streisand, she is one of thnly three PEGOT winners (people who have won a Peabody Award, an Emmy, A Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony). She appeared in her first film in 1950 and is still working today.Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It, directed by Mariem Pérez Riera, is a loving look at the actress, her life, and her career. Its structure is roughly chronological, with forays into various aspects of her life: her childhood in Puerto Rico and New York City; the racism she has faced; the sexual harassment and outright abuse she experienced; her relationship with Marlon Brando; her marriage to Leonard Gordon; and, of course, her work in film, television and on on stage. The centrepiece of the documentary is an interview with Rita Moreno, interspersed throughout the film. Also interspersed throughout the film is commentary by such diverse individuals as Puerto Rican actor, singer, songwriter, playwright, and producer Lin-Manuel Miranda; actress Eva Longoria; West Side Story co-star George Chakris; Electric Company co-star Morgan Freeman; television producer Norman Lear; her daughter Fernanda Gordon Fisher, and others. Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It goes into her life in some depth. As expected, West Side Story is discussed, but so is some of her other work, including the children's TV show Electric Company, her guest appearance on The Rockford Files, and the Broadway play The Ritz. Miss Moreno talks about the many \"exotic\" roles she was forced to play early in her career, including Tuptim in The King and I. Watching Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It can be rough going at times, as Rita discusses some unpleasant subjects, particularly the racism and sexual harassment she experienced in her career. What makes Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It succeed as a documentary is Miss Moreno's at times brutal honesty, even about herself on topics ranging from Hollywood to the low sense of self-esteem she had throughout her life.If Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It has one flaw it is that I sometimes wish more time could be devoted to each topic. Indeed, entire documentaries could be devoted to Rita Moreno's work on West Side Story, the racism she faced in Hollywood, or even her work on The Electric Company. In the end, Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It could have been much longer.Even though I wish more time could have been devoted to each topic, Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It is well-worth watching. It is a loving and honest look at an actress who broken own barriers in her long career and is still working to this day."},

While best known today for the series \"Mexican Spitfire\" movies, Lupe Vélez made several successful movies prior those films, and she had a successful career on stage as well. American radio was the one medium she did not conquer. She appeared on only a few American radio shows, all of those appearances in the Forties. It was in 1932 that Lupe Vélez made her debut on radio, on the radio show The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air. The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air was a short-lived attempt to bring the well-known Ziegfeld Follies to radio. It ran from April 3 to June 26 1932. It should come as no surprise that Lupe Vélez should appear on Ziegfeld Follies of the Air. In 1932 she was appearing as Concita in the production Hot-Cha!, which was produced by Flo Ziegfeld himself. Unfortunately, I could not find out what episodes of  The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air in which Lupe Vélez appeared.It was on April 14 1935 that Lupe Vélez appeared on the Lux Radio Theatre episode \"The Broken Wing.\" It was an adaptation of the 1932 movie of the same name, in which Lupe Vélez played the lead role of Lolita. Curiously the film was banned in Mexico City by the Federal District government, who claimed that it \"...slurred Mexico.\" Lux Radio Theatre was well-known for adapting movies as radio shows. In fact, the following week there would be an adaptation of the 1933 version of Little Women.It was on March 14 1937 that Lupe Vélez appeared on the radio show Texaco Town. Texaco Town was a variety show sponsored by Texaco and hosted by Eddie Cantor, for which reason it was also known as The Eddie Cantor Show. Today Texaco Town might be best remembered not only as a vehicle for Eddie Cantor, but also because it featured a young singer named Deanna Durbin. Lupe Vélez's final appearance on radio was her second appearance on Lux Radio Theatre. On May 24, 1937 she appeared on the radio show's adaptation of the 1936 film Under Two Flags. She played the role of Cigarette, a role originated on screen by Claudette Colbert. While Lupe Vélez would no longer appear on radio, she continued to be a popular movie star, even as her private life sometimes received more press than her films. It was a mark of her popularity that at her funeral in California more than 4,000 people attended. Thousands also attended her funeral in Mexico. To this day Lupe Vélez remains one most popular Mexican actresses to work in Hollywood. It seems likely she always will be."},

Desi Arnaz became the first Latino to star on an American sitcom. I Love Lucy was also historic in being the first American television to portray a mixed marriage. Desi Arnaz was born on March 2 1917 in Santiago de Cuba. It was following the Cuban Revolution of 1933 that his family immigrated to Miami. It was in the United States that Mr. Arnaz launched his music career. His Desi Arnaz Orchestra proved highly successful, to the point that he came to the attention of Rogers and Hart. They cast him in a role in their 1939 Broadway musical Too Many Girls. Desi Arnaz reprised his role when RKO adapted Too Many Girls as a 1940 musical. It was here that he met Lucille Ball. The two fell in love and married.As to Lucille Ball, she was an established movie star by the end of the Thirties and continued to be a popular performer in the Forties. It was in 1948 that she was cast in the role of Liz Cooper on the radio show My Favorite Husband. My Favorite Husband proved popular, so in 1950 CBS decided they wanted to adapt the hit program for television. CBS asked Lucille Ball to reprise her role as Liz Cooper on the television version of My Favorite Husband, but Miss Ball insisted that real-life husband Desi Arnaz play her husband on the show. CBS rejected the casting of Desi Arnaz on My Favorite Husband as they did not believe audiences would accept an \"All-American\" woman and a Cuban man. In response to CBS, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz then created their own vaudeville act, which was written by My Favorite Husband writers  Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz took their vaudeville act on the road and it proved to be very successful. The success of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's vaudeville act persuaded CBS executive Harry Ackerman that a show starring the couple could be successful. At the same time Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's prospective new show generated interest at CBS's archrival NBC. With the prospect of losing Miss Ball to NBC, Harry Ackerman eventually gave into Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's wishes and the result was I Love Lucy.For those few of you who are unfamiliar with I Love Lucy, the show centred on housewife Lucy Ricardo and her husband, upcoming Cuban bandleader Ricky Ricardo. The two lived in an apartment in New York City, which they rented from their neighbours Ethel and Fred Mertz. Many of the show's plots rotated around Lucy's efforts to break into show business, often as part of Ricky's act. As to Ricky Ricardo, no secret was made of the character's Cuban ancestry. In fact, Ricky was essentially a fictionalized version of Desi Arnaz himself. Just as Mr. Arnaz had immigrated to the United States so too had Ricky. Desi Arnaz's Cuban flavoured music featured prominently in the series, Today Ricky could be considered a bit of a Latin stereotype. He was highly excitable and he had a bit of a temper. When upset it was not unusual for Ricky to erupt with a stream of rapidly spoken Spanish. While there were aspects of the character of Ricky Ricardo that could be considered stereotypical, there were other aspects of the character that ran contrary to common assumptions made about Latinos in the United States in the early Fifties. Ricky Ricardo was college educated, having attended Havana University. Starting out as the bandleader at the Tropicana, he eventually bought the club and renamed it the Club Babalu. Ricky offered a sharp contrast to other Latino character on television in the Fifties. Frank the gardener on Father Knows Best, who was so naive that it seems likely he couldn't function in American society without the Anderson family. Pepino on The Real McCoys was always deferential to the McCoys and often the target of Amos McCoy's tirades. In portraying a character who embraced his Cuban identity, while at the same time being married to a white woman, I Love Lucy challenged the homogeneity of American television in the Fifties, a time when the vast majority of characters, particularly on sitcoms, were white. At the same time I Love Lucy proved that a show could be inclusive and yet still be successful on American television. Indeed, it was not only one of the most successful shows of the Fifties, but one of the most successful shows of all time. Both as an actor on I Love Lucy and as a producer and business man behind the scenes, Desi Arnaz was very much a pioneer, paving the way for other Latinos on American television. While Latinos are still rare on American broadcast network television, the fact that there are any at all can largely be attributed to Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball insisting on a TV show that reflected their real-life marriage."},

Tommy Kirk was born on December 10 1941 in Louisville, Kentucky. His family moved to Downey, California when he was only a baby. His acting career began when he accompanied his older brother Joe to an audition for Ah Wilderness at the Pasadena Playhouse.

It was followed by guest appearances on Lux Video Theatre, Frontier, Big Town, Crossroads, Gunsmoke, and The Loretta Young Show. He made his film debut in an uncredited role in The Peacemaker (1956). In 1956 he auditioned for a part in \"The Hardy Boys\" segment of The Mickey Mouse Club. He was cast as Joe Hardy and appeared in \"Hardy Boys\" segments on The Mickey Mouse Club from 1956 to 1957.  It was after his work on the \"Hardy Boys\" segment of The Mickey Mouse Club that Disney cast him as Travis Coates in Old Yeller (1957), his biggest role to date. He appeared in major roles in the Disney features The Shaggy Dog (1959) and Swiss Family Robinson (1960). He continued to guest star on television shows, including The Californians, Matinee Theatre, Playhouse 90, The Millionaire, and Bachelor Father. In the Sixties Tommy Kirk continued to appear in various Disney projects, including a string of comedies. He appeared in the Disney films The Absent Minded Professor, Babes in Toyland (1961), Moon Pilot (1962), Bon Voyage! (1962), Son of Flubber (1963), Savage Sam (1963), and The Misadventures of Merlin Jones (1964). It was while shooting The Misadventures of Merlin Jones that Disney learned that Tommy Kirk was seeing a 15 year old boy. The studio decided not to renew his contract. He appeared in the AIP film Pajama Party (1964) before returning to Disney for one more film, The Monkey's Uncle (1965). For the remainder of the Sixties Mr. Kirk appeared in the films Village of the Giants (1965), The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini (1966), Unkissed Bride (1966), It's a Bikini World (1967), Catalina Caper (1967), Track of Thunder (1967), Blood of Ghostly Horror (1967), and Mars Needs Women (1968).

He appeared in the films The Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfolds (1995), Little Miss Magic (1998), Billy Frankenstein (1998), and The Education of a Vampire (2001). Tommy Kirk was a gifted actor who excelled at both drama and comedy. He gave an impressive performance as Travis Coates in both Old Yeller and its sequel Savage Sam. At the same time, he did well as Merlin Jones in both The Misadventures of Merlin Jones and The Monkey's Uncle. While Tommy Kirk's career was undeservedly short, it included many more memorable films than actors with longer careers. Between the movies Tommy Kirk made for Disney and for American International Pictures, it is safe to say people will be watching his films for years to come."},

He grew up in the suburb Phoenix, Illinois. Starting at age 10 he worked in his father's tailor shop. It was his mother who encouraged his interest in art history. He attended  Ohio Wesleyan University, where he received a Bachelor's degree in English literature. He was also enrolled in the university's Air Force ROTC program, and after graduating he served three years in the Air Force as a flight navigator. He tried making a living as a painter before moving to San Francisco. Unable to get a job with the airlines as a pilot, he made his living as a trolley gripman. After being fired from the transit company, he wrote, directed, and acted in the shorts \"Three Pickup Men for Herrick\" (1957) and \"Sunlight\" (1957).  He shopped both shorts around Hollywood, but found on one who would hire him as a director. He moved to the Netherlands, where he adopted the name Melvin Van Peebles. There he performed with the Dutch National Theatre for a time. He directed the short \"Cinq cent balles\" (1961).  When Mad tried a French edition in 1965, they hired Melvin Van Peebles as its editor. He directed his first feature film in Europe, La permission (1967). It won an award at the San Francisco International Film Festival, and attracted the attention of Hollywood.His first Hollywood feature was Watermelon Man (1970), starring Godfrey Cambridge. Wanting complete control of his next film, he funded most of it by himself. The end result was Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song (1971). Made on a shoestring budget, it proved to be a success and is credited as one of the films to launch the cycle of Blaxploitation films in the Seventies. He would go onto direct the films Don't Play Us Cheap (1972), Identity Crisis (1989), Le conte du ventre plein (2000), and Confessions of a Ex-Doofus-ItchyFooted Mutha (2008). He directed the segment \"Vroom Vroom Vroooom\" in the movie Tales of Erotica (1996). On television he directed an episode of The Bill Cosby Show, the TV movie Gang in Blue, and an episode of the 1990s revival of The Outer Limits.As an actor he appeared in his own films Watermelon Man, Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song, and Identity Crisis. In the Eighties he appeared in the films O. C. and Stiggs (1985), America (1986), and Jaws: The Revenge (1987).  He played the regular role of Mel Spoon on the TV series Sonny Spoon and appeared in the mini-series The Sophisticated Gents. He appeared in the TV movie Taking Care of Terrific and guest starred on In the Heat of the Night. In the Nineties he appeared in the films True Identity (1991), Boomerang (1992), Posse (1993), Last Action Hero (1993), Terminal Velocity (1994), Panther (1995), Fist of the North Star (1995), Love Kills (1998), Time of Her Time (2000), and Antilles sur Seine (2000). He guest starred on the TV shows Dream On, Living Single, and Homicide: Life in the Street. He appeared in the mini-series The Shining and the TV movies Gang in Blue, Calm in Sunset, and Riot. From the Naughts into the Teens he appeared in the films The Hebrew Hammer (2003), Blackout (2007), Redemption Road (2010), We the Party (2012), Peebles (2013), and Armed (2018). He guest starred on the television soap opera All My Children in 2008.Melvin Van Peebles also wrote the plays The Hostage (1964),  Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death (1971),  Don't Play Us Cheap (1972), Out There by Your Lonesome (1973), Waltz of the Stork (1982), and Champeen (1983). He was co-librettist on the play Reggae (1980). He also wrote several books, including The Big Heart (1957).Melvin Van Peebles was certainly a remarkable talent, one who worked in multiple media. As a playwright he won a Tony. As a TV writer he won an Emmy. Throughout it all he remained loyal to his own vision. He certainly had an impact on film history. Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song presented Black characters as never before seen on screen. And while it is debatable if the film itself is Blaxploitation (it plays in many ways more like an independent art film), there can be no doubt that it sparked the Blaxploitaiton cycle that followed it. Film history would certainly be different had Melvin Van Peebles never existed."},

{"title": "Catch Us If You Can (1965)", "date": "Saturday, September 25, 2021", "text": "In late 1963 the United Kingdom was overwhelmed by Beatlemania. In the wake of The Beatles' success, other beat bands came to prominence. Among these bands was The Dave Clark Five, for a brief time considered The Beatles' chief rivals. The Dave Clark Five would hit no. 1 on the UK singles chart with \"Glad All Over\" and then no. 2 on the UK singles chart with \"Bits and Pieces.\" While The Dave Clark Five would not repeat this success in the United Kingdom, they proved extremely popular in the United States, where they would ultimately have 10 top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100. It was quite natural, then, that following the release of The Beatles' movie A Hard Day's Night (1964) The Dave Clark Five would star in their own movie.While at the time other movies starring British rock bands simply imitated The Beatles' movies A Hard Day's Night and Help! (1965) or, at the very least , the movies of Elvis Presley and Cliff Richard, The DC5's movie Catch Us If You Can (1965) was something entirely different. The Dave Clark Five do not play a band, but instead a crew of stuntmen. At no point in the movie do they play instruments or sing songs, so it is difficult to even say it is even a British rock musical. In fact, Dave Clark's character is named \"Steve,\" although the rest of the band get to use their own names. Catch Us If You Can is further set apart from other movies starring British rock bands in that Dave Clark is definitely the star of the movie, with rest of The DC5 playing supporting roles. This is a sharp contrast to The Beatles' movies, in which The Beatles more or less share the spotlight together.What is more, while other movies starring British rock bands, including The Beatles' films, are comedies, Catch Us If You Can is an at times dark satire. Indeed, more than one critic described the movie as \"melancholy.\" In Catch Us If You Can The Dave Clark Five play a crew of stuntmen. It is while filming a commercial for the advertising campaign \"Meat to Go\" that Steve becomes disenchanted with his job. He bonds with the young actress, model, and \"Meat to Go\" poster girl, Dinah (Barbara Ferris), who has also become disillusioned with her work. The two then flee in a Jaguar for Burgh Island. They are pursued by the police, publicists, and journalists. In the meantime the advertising agency behind the \"Meat to Go\" campaign decide to milk the incident for publicity, cooking up a fake story about Dinah having been kidnapped. Catch Us if You Can often seems less like a vehicle for a rock band than it does an attack on advertising and consumerism, and an examination of the difficulty of remaining authentic and the meaning of success.If it might seem odd for a band to be named for their drummer,  Dave Clark was not The DC5's was the driving force in the band. He was also The Dave Clark Five's manager and controlled nearly every aspect of the band's career. There can be no doubt that he had a good deal of input into the movie. Indeed, Dave Clark had worked as a stuntman. It was reportedly Dave Clark who chose John Boorman to direct the film, marking his feature film debut. Mr. Boorman had directed television documentaries and had been the head of the BBC's Documentary Unit in Bristol. He would go onto direct Deliverance (1972) and Excalibur (1981). The script was written by Peter Nichols, who had worked extensively in television.While Dave Clark was definitely the star of Catch Us If You Can, the other members of The Dave Clark Five did get their moments in the spotlight. This was particularly true of guitarist Lenny Davidson. Throughout the entire film Lenny Davidson does not get to say a word as someone else interrupts him before he even has a chance to speak. At the Arts Ball costume party in the movie he even comes as Harpo Marx. Of course, to stay in character, he can't speak. Catch Us If You Can was released in the United Kingdom on July 15 1965. In the United States, for some odd reason, it was retitled Having a Wild Weekend. While \"Having a Wild Weekend\" was a song in the movie, it was not the movie's single in the United Kingdom or the United States (that was \"Catch Us If You Can\") and would never be released as a single. One can only assume that some American marketer decided that Having a Wild Weekend was a better title. Regardless, it was released in the US on August 18 1965. Catch Us If You Can did not perform particularly well at the box office in the United Kingdom. It did not even perform well in the United States, where The DC5 were much more popular. The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Pauline Kael gave the movie a somewhat positive review, stating that it was \"..one of those films that linger in the memory.\" Bosley Crowther also gave Catch Us If You Can a positive review, calling it a \"..fresh and fetching British film.\" While Pauline Kael and Bosley Crowther liked the film, Dwight MacDonald did not. Writing in Esquire, he said of Catch Us If You Can, \"The photography and the direction are atrocious, the jokes painful, the structure really chaotic, the spontaneity arthritic, and The Dave Clark Five remarkably uncharming and unwitty.\" Of cousre, in defence of The DC5, it must be pointed out that Mr. MacDonald hated The Beatles' Help! as well.Rock music changed rapidly as the Sixties progressed. And while many of the early beat bands kept pace with these changes, The Dave Clark Five did not. By 1967 The DC5, whose success was once close to that of The Beatles in the US, were passée. In the years since Dave Clark , who controlled the band's catalogue, did not make their recordings available except in the occasional compilation. The end result has been that The Dave Clark Five, once regarded as rivals to The Beatles, have largely been forgotten. Catch Us If You Can is now remembered by many as the directorial debut of John Boorman. That having been said, it is a remarkable movie that stands apart form other Sixties movies starring rock bands. In many ways it is a forerunner to the darker films about Swinging London that emerged in the mid-Sixties, including Blowup (1967). It is certainly well worth checking out, particularly for fans of British music of the Sixties or movies about Swinging London."},

{"title": "The 60th Anniversary of NBC Saturday Night at the Movies ", "date": "Thursday, September 23, 2021", "text": "It was sixty years ago today, on September 23 1961, that Saturday Night at the Movies debuted on NBC. By the mid-Sixties it would be renamed NBC Saturday Night at the Movies, perhaps to avoid confusion with the other movie anthology shows airing on the other two networks. NBC Saturday Night at the Movies was historic in that it was the first movie anthology series to air recently released movies, many of them in colour. This set it apart from the movie anthology shows on local stations (such as Movie 4 on WNBC in New York City), which were generally limited to older films made before 1946.Of course, NBC Saturday Night at the Movies was not the very first movie anthology show to air on an American broadcast network.  ABC had aired an earlier movie anthology series, Famous Film Festival, in the 1955-1956 season. What set Famous Film Festival apart from Saturday Night at the Movies is that it was only aired in black and white and it aired British films from J. Arthur Rank Productions. Furthermore, it was only ninety minutes in length, so that films were either heavily edited or aired in two parts. In 1957 ABC aired Hollywood Film Festival, which aired movies from RKO made before 1948. What set NBC Saturday Night at the Movies apart from these two earlier movie anthologies is that it  aired films made after 1948 in colour and with minimal editing for time and content (at least in the early days).The impetus behind the creation behind the creation of Saturday Night at the Movies was quite simply rival CBS's line-up on Saturday night. CBS dominated the night with Perry Mason (no. 16 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1960-1961 season), Checkmate (no. 21 for the same season), Have Gun--Will Travel (no. 3 for the year), and Gunsmoke (the no. 1 show on television). It was then in order to better compete with CBS that NBC bought the broadcast rights to 31 films made after 1949 from 20th Century Fox. The first movie aired on Saturday Night at the Movies was How to Marry a Millionaire (1953). While the film was eight years old, it was still much more recent than many of the films that had previously aired on American television. Other films aired in the first season of Saturday Night at the Movies included There's No Business Like Show Business (1954), Broken Arrow (1950), Cheaper By The Dozen (1950), and The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). The most recent film aired that first season was Soldier of Fortune (1955).The length of any given edition of NBC Saturday Night at the Movies could vary. When a film did not fill out the entire two hours scheduled, theatrical trailers or \"making of\" featurettes would be shown after the movie. Sometimes longer movies would run past the two hours usually scheduled, pushing back the late local news by a few minutes. As some of the films were filmed in widescreen processes, some films were panned-and-scanned to fit the aspect ratio of television screens of the era. Letterboxing would not exist for decades.Saturday Night at the Movies did indeed make NBC more competitive with its rival CBS. In fact, Gunsmoke began dropping gradually in the ratings over the following seasons. In the 1961-1962 season it had dropped to no. 3. In the 1962-1963 season it dropped to no.10. By the 1966-1967 season Gunsmoke had dropped out of the top 30 of the Nielsen ratings for the year and CBS executives cancelled the show. The furore that ensued over the cancellation of the Western, not to mention the fact that it was the favourite show of Babe Paley (wife of CBS's CEO William S. Paley) led to it being returned to the schedule in a new Monday night timeslot.The success of Saturday Night at the Movies also led to further movie anthologies, both on NBC and other networks. It was during the 1962-1963 season that NBC found itself without sponsors for the shows It's a Man's World and Saints and Sinners on Monday night. As it is, neither show ever had any success in the Nielsen ratings. At the same time NBC wanted to compete with rival CBS's powerful Monday night line-up, which included such hits as The Lucy Show, The Danny Thomas Show, and The Andy Griffith Show. NBC then decided to air another movie anthology show on Monday nights. They purchased $15 million worth of movies from MGM and 20th Century Fox, including The Asphalt Jungle (1950), Father of the Bride (1950), Life is a Many Spendored Thing (1955), and Executive Suite (1954) among others. Monday Night at the Movies debuted on February 4 1963. It did not repeat the success of Saturday Night at the Movies. so NBC moved its second movie anthology to Wednesday nights for the 1964-1965 season. For the 1965-1966 season NBC's second movie anthology was moved to Tuesday nights, where it would remain for years.It was not long after NBC debuted Monday Night at the Movies that ABC debuted its first movie anthology, Hollywood Special, on Sunday night. ABC had purchased 15 United Artists movies for Hollywood Special. Debuting on April 8 1962, it would not return for the 1963-1964 season. It was at the start of the 1964-1965 season that ABC launched the successor to Hollywood Special, The ABC Sunday Night Movie. It remained on the air until 1998. As to CBS, as the no. 1 network, it held off on its first movie anthology until the 1965-1966 season. That season CBS launched CBS Thursday Night Movies. The demand for movies on the various movie anthology shows on the networks would lead to the production of made-for-TV movies. While the first made-for-TV movie is generally considered See How They Run in 1964 (more on that later), an argument can be made that they had existed since the Fifties. There were filmed TV specials that exceeded an hour in length, such as The Pied Piper of Hamelin in 1957, that could be counted as made-for-TV movies. There were also filmed episodes of such anthology shows as Hallmark Hall of Fame and Playhouse 90 that were longer than an hour that could also qualify as made-for-TV movies. Regardless, it was in the 1963-1964 season that NBC and Universal (then two separate companies) decided to produce made-for-TV movies. The first made-for-TV movie in the project was to have been an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's The Killers, but it was deemed too violent for broadcast and was released theatrically instead. The first to actually be broadcast was then See How They Run, starring John Forsythe. It aired on October 7 1964 and ushered in the era of made-for-TV movies.While the television networks began making made-for-TV movies, the feature films aired on the various movie anthologies gradually became more recent in vintage. When How to Marry a Millionaire aired on the first edition of Saturday Night at the Movies, it was eight years old. In the 1963-1964 season there was another Marilyn Monroe vehicle, Lets Make Love (1960). It was only three years old when it aired on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies. As the Sixties progressed, films aired on the various network movie anthologies could be as young as two years old, a sharp contrast to when Saturday Night at the Movies had debuted. Over the years a number of different announcers worked on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies In its early years the most familiar might have been Don Stanley, who also served as an announcer for other NBC shows as well as for KNBC in Los Angeles. Later on such announcers as Donald Rickles, Peggy Taylor, and Victor Bozeman worked on the show.  For much of the movie anthology's run, its announcers all worked out of NBC's studios in Burbank, but towards the end of its run their announcers from New York would announce the movies, even though the bumpers were still handled by the West Coast announcing staff. As mentioned earlier, movies were occasionally edited to fit in the allotted time and for content as well. Editing for content would become a greater cause for concern as the Sixties progressed. In fact, in at least one instance a film was edited so heavily that it became an entirely different movie. Under the title Kiss of Evil, the Hammer film The Kiss of the Vampire (1963) aired on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies on March 18 1967. In editing the film for television, the movie's American distributor, Universal, trimmed so much time that new footage had to be shot in order for it to fit in the allotted time. The new footage introduced characters who interact with no one else in the movie.The success of NBC Saturday Night at the Movies was so great that by 1968 there was a movie anthology on every night of the week. NBC itself had three different movie anthologies on the schedule. It was perhaps because of the glut of movie anthologies on the network's schedule that eventually NBC Saturday Night at the Movies would go into decline. While other movie anthologies would continue into the Nineties and even the Naughts, NBC Saturday Night at the Movies ended its original run in October 1978. It was revived for a time in the 2000-2001 season. Since then NBC has only occasionally shown theatrical movies. Since May 2020 NBC has irregularly aired movies under the title NBC Movie Night.While NBC Saturday Night at the Movies would not last as long as other movie anthologies, it was the one that had the most impact. It was the first to air recently released movies and in colour at that. Its success spurred the creation of further movie anthologies, some of which lasted into this century. In the end NBC Saturday Night at the Movies changed American television to such a point that it would not be the same without it."},

This year he appeared in the movie Before I Go. He was set to appear in the Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That.Willie Garson was an incredible actor. It was largely due to his performance that Mozzie is often the favourite character of many White Collar fans. Mozzie had a knack for uncovering information others could not and he had a photographic memory as well. And while he was a con man, he often tended to be soft-hearted. Of course, Mozzie was not the only role Willie Garson played. In the X-Files episode \"The Goldberg Variation,\" he played Henry Meems, a man with a fascination for Rube Goldberg devices who seems to be able to defy death. On NYPD Blue, he played the maintenance man of protagonist Bobby Simone's apartment, Henry Coffield. Although he was known for playing lovable characters, Willie Garson could play unsympathetic characters as well. On the TV show Taken, he played a Dr. Kreutz, a former Nazi scientist who has no qualms about how he test subjects in experiments. Willie Garson was a wonderful actor who could play a wide variety of roles and play all of them very well."},

A cause of death has yet be released. Mr. Johnson appeared in such movies as House Party (1990) and Friday (1995).Anthony Johnson was born on February 1 1966 in Compton, California. His father, Eddie Smith, was a stuntman who co-founded the Black Stuntmen's Association. His father helped him get his foot in the door of the entertainment industry by getting him work behind the scenes. He made his television debut in the TV movie Puss in Boots in 1982. In the Eighties he also appeared in a bit part in an episode of the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. In 1990 he made his feature film debut in House Party.In the Nineties Anthony Johnson appeared in the movies Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), Menace II Society (1993), House Party (1994), Panther (1995), The Great White Hope (1996), B*A*P*S* (1997), How to Be a Player (1997), The Players Club (1998), Woo (1998), I Got the Hook Up (1998), and Rising to the Top (1999).

{"title": "TCM Backlot Is Closing", "date": "Monday, September 20, 2021", "text": "TCM Backlot, Turner Classic Movies' official fan club, is closing in October. According to TCM's announcement when it launched, TCM Backlot was meant to give fans \"..unprecedented access to all things TCM including exclusive content, never-before-seen talent interviews, archival videos from the TCM vault, an exclusive TCM podcast, as well as opportunities to win visits to the TCM set, attend meet and greets with TCM hosts and the opportunity to influence programming through online votes.\"Turner Classic Movies announced the launch of TCM Backlot on April 27 2016. Initially a subscription to the fan club cost $87 a year. It was in March 2018 that they introduced a monthly subscription of $7.97 a month. It was very early in the history of TCM Backlot that they introduced local chapters. Local chapters of TCM Backlot were officially sanctioned groups of TCM fans who would meet regularly to discuss movies, watch movies, and take part in other events. The TCM Backlot local chapter program proved popular and several major cities boasted local chapters. Sadly, the TCM Backlot local chapter program would be discontinued in September 2019, but many of the local chapters would continue as unofficial TCM fan clubs to this day.TCM Backlot also had its own events. Many of these would take place at the TCM Classic Film Festival. Every year there would be TCM in Your Hometown contest, whereby Turner Classic Movies would come to the winner's hometown with a free screening of a classic movie. The winner of the 3rd TCM in Your Hometown contest was Lisa Buchhold, who sent in a pitch for St. Louis. On September 26, then, TCM hosted a free screening of Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) at the Tivoli Theatre in University City in St. Louis. There was a V.I.P. Meet & Greet with Ben Mankiewicz and Margaret O'Brien (who played Tootie in the movie) at the Moonrise Hotel. Before the movie there was a special introduction and Q&A with Margaret O'Brien. This was the one TCM Backlot event I got to attend and I enjoyed it immensely. Aside from meeting Ben Mankiewicz in person and Margaret O'Brien, I also got to meet many of my TCM pals for the first time.Of course, at the TCM Classic Film Festival, the TCM Classic Cruise, and the various TCM Backlot events, there were also exclusive pins. TCM Backlot members would also receive early access to the TCM Boutique, the portion of the TCM Shop where one can get TCM Classic Film Festival merchandise.On the TCM Backlot web page there was exclusive access to articles, interviews, videos, and so on. There were several online votes in which members could vote for which star would get a day of programming. TCM Backlot members were also able to submit trivia questions for the various TCM Big Screen Classics.Unfortunately, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic would take a toll on TCM Backlot. It was last year that TCM Backlot announced that it would not longer be accepting new memberships or renewals. At the time many TCM Backlot members assumed this would be temporary and they would eventually begin accepting new memberships again. Articles continued to be published on the website, votes continued to be held, and submissions for trivia questions continued as well. Still, in many ways the announcement that TCM Backlot would close in October came as no surprise to many.Having joined TCM Backlot in 2018, I have to say that I am sad to see it go. I got a good deal of enjoyment out of TCM Backlot and, after all, it was through TCM Backlot that I not only got to see Meet Me in St. Louis on the big screen, but I got to meet Margaret O'Brien as well. I enjoyed reading the many articles and browsing the archive of old interviews, old promos, and old introductions in the video vault. I honestly wish TCM would reconsider and continue TCM Backlot. Eventually this pandemic will end and once that happens, TCM Backlot could return to its former glory. Regardless, I know I will miss TCM Backlot."},
{"title": "Car 54, Where Are You? Turns 60", "date": "Friday, September 17, 2021", "text": "Car 54, Where Are You? isn't a show one hears much about any more, but it remains popular among fans of classic television. Among other things, the show was an early workplace comedy. It was set New York City Police precinct house fourteen years before Barney Miller. Ultimately, it would prove to be an influence on future sitcoms. Car 54, Where Are You? debuted sixty years ago today, on September 17 1961 on NBC.Car 54, Where Are You? was the creation of Nat Hiken, best known then as now as the creator of The Phil Silvers Show. It emerged from Mr. Hiken's visit to a a New York City precinct house where he realized that the real life police officers there were a far cry from their counterparts on radio, on television, or in films. It occurred to him that the day to day work of police officers could form the basis for a situation comedy. He made further trips to the precinct house for research. In sharp contrast to the portrayal of police precinct houses in much of the media, Nat Hiken found the precinct house he visited to be \"...a very warm, friendly atmosphere.\"Car 54, Where Are You? centred on Officer Gunther Toody (played by Joe E. Ross) and Officer Frances Muldoon (played by Fred Gwynne) of the 53rd Precinct. Officer Toody was not terribly bright, and often overly talkative. His wife, Lucille (played by Beatrice Pons) could be domineering and was often loud. Officer Muldoon was his opposite. He had gone to college and was even intellectual to a degree. While Officer Toody could be loud and gabby, Officer Muldoon tended to be quiet and reserved. Officer Muldoon lived with his mother (played by Ruth Masters) and his two younger sisters. The title comes from the car to which Officers Toody and Muldoon were assigned, Car 54.>Nat Hiken found a sponsor for Car 54, Where Are You?  in Proctor & Gamble, who financed the show's pilot. The show was picked up by NBC. Car 54, Where Are You? differed from other sitcoms of the era in that it was filmed on location in New York City. So the police cars on the show would not be mistaken for the genuine article, they were painted red and white rather than black and white. As the show was shot in black and white, the \"red\" would show up as \"black\" on the television screen. Interiors were shot at the old Biograph Studios in The Bronx.Nat Hiken not only produced Car 54, Where Are You? and wrote and directed many of its episodes, but he also wrote the theme song with John Strauss.  Car 54, Where Are You? also differed from other sitcoms in that it had a rather large cast of recurring characters. Captain Paul Block (played by Paul Reed) was the head of the 53rd Precinct. Among the other officers at the 53rd Precinct was Officer Schnauser, a role that Nat Hiken had created specifically for Al Lewis. He was married to Sylvia Schnauser (played by Charlotte Rae). Schnauser's partner was Officer Ed Nicholson (played by Hank Garrett). Other officers on the show included Rodriguez (played by Jack Healy) and O'Hara (played by Albert Henderson). The 53rd Precinct's radio dispatcher was Officer David Anderson (played by Nipsey Russell). In featuring Nipsey Russell in a prominent role, Car 54, Where Are You? was a bit ahead of its time. It also featured other Black actors, including Ossie Davis as Officer Omar Anderson and Frederick O'Neal as Officer Wallace.Car 54, Where Are You? was well received. It won the Emmy for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy and was nominated for Emmy Awards for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Comedy and Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Humor in the 1961-1962 season. It was nominated again for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Comedy in the 1962-1963 season. It also did well in the ratings, coming in at no. 20 for the 1961-1962 season. It dropped in the ratings in the 1962-1963 season, but was still doing relatively well.Unfortunately, Nat Hiken was under enormous stress producing, writing, and directing Car 54, Where Are You?. Furthermore, Joe E. Ross could often be a source of problems on the set. Nat Hiken then entertained offers from Hollywood studios for them to take control of Car 54, Where Are You? Four Star Productions made an offer for the series. Desilu also wanted the series, although negotiations between Desilu and Nat Hiken eventually fell apart. Nat Hiken then entered into negotiations with NBC itself, but those negotiations also fell apart. Ultimately, no one would Nat Hiken's terms with regards to Car 54, Where Are You? and as a result he ended the show after two seasons.Car 54, Where Are You? went onto a fairly successful run in syndication. In 1990 a feature film, starring  John C. McGinley as Muldoon and  David Johansen as Toody was made. It would not be released until 1994. It bombed at the box office and received largely negative reviews.The movie certainly didn't hurt the original series. Since the Nineties Car 54, Where Are You? has aired on MeTV and Decades, and is widely available on various streaming services. It is also available on DVD. While one doesn't hear much about Car 54, Where Are You? these days, it certainly left its mark on television."},
{"title": "The Late Great Jane Powell", "date": "Thursday, September 16, 2021", "text": "Jane Powell is one of those stars from the Golden Age with whom I have been familiar since childhood. I saw Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954) on broadcast network television and, like so many before me, I fell under Miss Powell's spell. As I grew older I would see more of her movies, including A Date with Judy (1948) and Royal Wedding (1951). In every role she played, she simply lit up the screen. It is to understand why she was one of the most successful stars of musicals in the Forties and Fifties. Sadly, Jane Powell died today, September 16 2021, at the age of 92.Jane Powell was born Suzanne Lorraine Burce on April 1 1929 in Portland, Oregon. Her parents were instrumental in leading her to pursue a career in entertainment, seeing in her the potential for her to become another Shirley Temple. During World War II, when she was still a child, Jane Powell was already playing night clubs. Eventually she received her own weekly radio show. It was in 1943 that her family went on vacation in Hollywood. While there she appeared on a talent contest on Janet Gaynor's radio show Stars Over Hollywood. As a result she came to the notice of MGM, who signed her to a contract at $225 a week. At age 15 she was loaned to United Artists to appear in what would be her first movie, Song of the Open Road (1944). In the movie her character was named \"Jane Powell,\" which she adopted as her stage name.Jane Powell's second movie, Delightfully Dangerous (1945), would also be for United Artists. Her first film for MGM was Holiday in Mexico (1946). She was one of the three female leads in Three Daring Daughters (1948) and with A Date with Judy (1948) she received her first role as the primary lead. In the late Forties she also appeared in the movies Luxury Liner (1948), Nancy Goes to Rio (1950) and Two Weeks with Love (1950).Jane Powell began the Fifties with one of her most famous roles, that of Ellen Bowen in Royal Wedding (1951). It was in 1954 that she appeared in what may be her most famous role, that of Milly in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. During the decade she appeared in the films, Rich, Young and Pretty (1951), Small Town Girl (1953), Athena (1954), Deep in My Heart (1954), Hit the Deck (1955), The Girl Most Likely (1957), The Female Animal (1958), and Enchanted Island (1958).  She made her television debut in an episode of Producer's Showcase in 1957. She guest starred on the shows Goodyear Theatre, Alcoa Theatre, and The Dupont Show with June Allyson. In 1959 she played Esther in a television production of Meet Me in St. Louis.In the Sixties Jane Powell's career shifted from movie to appearances on stage. In 1964 she played Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady at Los Angeles' Valley West Theatre. She also played in productions of The Unsinkable Molly Brown, The Boy Friend, and The Sound of Music. She appeared frequently on television during the decade, including several appearances on The Red Skelton Show. She also guest appeared on the show The Dick Powell Show, The Ed Sullivan Show, and The Tim Conway Hour. She appeared in the TV movies Hooray for Love and Feathertop. In 1961 she starred in an unsold pilot, The Jane Powell Show. In the pilot she played an actress and singer who marries a math professor who lives in a small California town.In 1974 Jane Powell made her only appearance on Broadway in the production Irene. She also appeared on stage in productions of I Do! I Do! and South Pacific. She the voice of Celeste in the animated feature film Tubby the Tuba. During the Seventies she guest starred on the TV show Fantasy Island. She appeared in the TV movies Wheeler and Murdoch, The Letters, and Mayday at 40,000 Feet.In the Eighties Miss Powell played the recurring role of Irma Seaver, the mother of lead character Dr. Jason Roland Seaver (Alan Thicke), on the sitcom Growing Pains. She guest starred on the shows Fantasy Island; Love Boat; and Murder, She Wrote. She appeared in the movie Marie (1985). In the Nineties she was a temporary substitute for the role of Lisa Grimaldi usually played by Eileen Fulton on the soap opera As the World Turns. She appeared in the mini-series Perfect Murder, Perfect Town: JonBenét and the City of Boulder and in the TV movie The Sandy Bottom Orchestra. She appeared in the movie Picture This (1999). In 2002 she guest starred on an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.Jane Powell had very close ties with Turner Classic Movies. In fact, she was tied to the cable channel from the very beginning, as one of the people present at TCM's launch on April 14 1994, along with Robert Osborne, Ted Turner, Celeste Holm, Van Johnson, and Arlene Dahl. She attended the TCM Classic Film Festival and also sailed aboard the TCM Classic Cruise.Quite simply, Jane Powell was one of the greatest musical stars of all time. She had an incredible voice that served her well in multiple movies and stage musicals. What is more, she had an effervescence and charisma that made her irresistible. Many think of Jane Powell's roles as always being that of the girl next door, but she actually did play much more. Milly in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was strong willed and stubborn enough to go head to head with seven mountain men. In The Girl Most Likely she played a woman who becomes engaged to three men at the same time. On Murder, She Wrote, she played the mother superior of a convent. Jane Powell was one of the last stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood. What is more, she was ever inch a star."},
{"title": "The 50th Anniversary of Columbo", "date": "Wednesday, September 15, 2021", "text": "It was 50 years ago today, on September 15 1971, that Columbo debuted as one of the rotating television shows on The NBC Mystery Movie. It would prove to be the most successful shows on The NBC Mystery Movie. It outlived The NBC Mystery Movie itself. When The NBC Mystery Movie ended its run in 1977, Columbo continued to air as a series of television movies in the 1977-1978 season. Columbo was revived in the 1988-1989 season as one of the shows on The ABC Mystery Movie. When The ABC Mystery Movie went off the air at the end of the 1989-1990 season, Columbo would continue on ABC as a series of TV movies that lasted until 2003.Columbo centred on Lt. Columbo (played by Peter Falk), a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Lt. Columbo was usually unshaven and almost always wore a rumpled raincoat. He smoked cheap cigars. On the surface he appeared to be bumbling and overly deferential to the point that he was almost always apologizing. While Columbo might appear bumbling, he possessed a razor sharp mind. He was an excellent judge of human nature, a sharp observer who picked up on clues others might miss, and a genius when it came to deductive reasoning.While Lt. Columbo was a sharp contrast to other television detectives, the show itself was a sharp contrast to other mystery series. Quite simply, it was a prime example of the inverted detective story, in which the crime is shown at the beginning of the story and the culprit is known to the reader (or in the case of Columbo, the viewer) from the start. Indeed, one gets the feeling even Lt. Columbo realizes who has committed a murder from the beginning. It is just a matter of gathering enough evidence before he can arrest them.Here it must be pointed out that Lt. Columbo actually pre-dates the show bearing his name. The character's origins go back to \"May I Come In\" by Richard Levinson and William Link, first published in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, March 1960. In the story there is a smallish detective named Lt. Fisher. Richard Levinson and William Link adapted the story as the episode \"Enough Rope\"for The Chevy Mystery Show, which aired on July 30 1960. In \"Enough Rope\" Lt. Fisher became Lt. Columbo, played by Bert Freed. Messrs. Levinson and Link were disappointed with how the episode turned out, and then set about adapting \"Enough Rope\" as a play. The play was titled Prescription: Murder and featured Thomas Mitchell (who played Uncle Billy in It's a Wonderful Life) in the role of Lt. Columbo. While Lt. Columbo was only a secondary character in the play, it became clear audiences loved the character.It was for that reason that when Prescription: Murder was adapted as a television movie, Lt. Columbo occupied centre stage. The role of Lt. Columbo was first offered to Lee J. Cobb, who turned out to be unavailable. It was then offered to Bing Crosby, who turned it down. The role finally went to Peter Falk, who had appeared in such movies as Murder Inc. (1960), for which he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and The Great Race (1965), as well as the TV series The Trials of O'Brien. Prescription: Murder aired on NBC on February 20 1968. The movie proved so successful that NBC wanted a series spun off from it, but Richard Levinson, William Link, and Peter Falk did not want to do a regularly scheduled television show at the time.vFor the 1971-1972 season NBC was planing an umbrella series, The NBC Mystery Movie. As an umbrella series The NBC Mystery Movie would rotate various programs in the same time slot. One of the programs NBC wanted as part of The NBC Mystery Movie was a Columbo series. Fortunately, Richard Levinson, William Link, and Peter Falk were more agreeable to a regular TV series at this point, and so a pilot, \"Ransom for a Dead Man,\" was commissioned. \"Ransom for a Dead Man\" aired on March 1 1971 and proved to be a success. Columbo was then added to the rotation of The NBC Mystery Movie, along with McCloud and McMillan & Wife.Columbo became the most popular shows to emerge from The NBC Mystery Movie and in many respects it easy to see why. Much of the appeal of the show was Peter Falk's performance as Lt. Columbo. He was nominated for ten Emmys for playing the character, and won five. In addition to Peter Falk, Columbo always featured big name guest stars. The culprit in every single episode was always some big name star, and murderers on the show were played by such actors as Eddie Albert, Anne Baxter, Robert Culp, Martin Landau, Ross Martin, and many others. The murder victims were often big name stars as well. Among the actors who appeared as victims on Columbo were Richard Anderson, Pat Crowley, Anne Francis, Martin Milner, Martin Sheen,  Forrest Tucker, and others. Big name guest stars even appeared in secondary roles, some of which were sometimes rather small. In the episode \"Negative Reaction,\" Larry Storch played a driving instructor. In \"Lovely But Lethal,\" Vincent Rice played the head of a cosmetics company.Beyond the appeal of the show's many guest stars, Columbo probably also appeals to many because it pits an everyman, Lt. Columbo, against the rich and powerful. The murders that Lt. Columbo investigate always seem to take place among the affluent. The murderers on Columbo were almost always rich, powerful, and intelligent. They also tended to be arrogant, leading them to underestimate the overly polite, often bumbling Lt. Columbo, much to their eternal regret at the end of the episode. Speaking as a fan of the show since childhood, I think most viewers take great satisfaction in Lt. Columbo taking down rich, powerful, and overly arrogant individuals a peg or two.The success of Columbo would lead to a series of books, the first of which was published in 1972. There would be another series of books published between 1994 and 1999. In 2010, Columbo co-creator William Link  wrote an anthology of short stories featuring the character, The Columbo Collection. It was published in 2010. The last episode of the original run of Columbo, \"The Conspirators,\" aired on May 13 1978. NBC was not finished with Columbo, as a spinoff, Mrs. Columbo, debuted on NBC on February 26 1979. On the original show, Columbo often referred to his wife, but Mrs. Columbo ignored the continuity of the original show to the point that it was unbelievable. Kate Mulgrew played Kate Columbo, supposedly the wife of Lt. Columbo. The casting of Kate Mulgrew in the role posed some problems with continuity, in that at the time Miss Mulgrew was only 24 years old. That means when Prescription: Murder first aired, she would only been 13. As it is, the show had been launched over the objections of Columbo creators Richard Levinson and William Link. As time passed the show would be renamed Kate Columbo, with Kate having gotten later. Still later, the show was renamed Kate the Detective and Kate Loves a Mystery, with the producers entirely ditching the show's original premise. Regardless, the 1989 revival of Columbo would entirely ignore Mrs. Columbo, making it clear the two shows did not share continuity.It was in the 1988-1989 season that Universal Television and ABC sought to revive the NBC Mystery Movie concept with The ABC Mystery Movie. Columbo was one of the original programs on this new umbrella series, along with Gideon Oliver and B. L. Stryker. Columbo proved to be the only show on The ABC Mystery Movie to have any success, outlasting the umbrella series by several years. The last episode of Columbo, \"Columbo Likes the Nightlife,\" aired on ABC on January 30 2003.While the original run ended in 1978 and the revival in 2003, Columbo has persisted in reruns ever since the last episode of the original run. To this day Lt. Columbo remains one of the most popular characters on American television. It is safe to say that Columbo will still be around for another fifty years."},

She was one of the first presidents of Women in Film.As a writer Irma Kalish was certainly versatile, both with and without her husband Austin Kalish. She could write for comedies in multiple genres. You wrote some of the best episodes of the broad spoof F Troop, but at the same time she and Austin Kalish could handle serious topics (such as in the case of \"Maude's Dilemma\") with sensitivity while still remaining funny. She wrote several hours of some of the funniest classic sitcoms on television, everything from I Dream of Jeannie to Too Close for Comfort. She was also a pioneer. When Irma Kalish began writing for television, there were only a few women in the medium. She paved the way for other women to work in television. Irma Kalish may not be a recognizable name to the average person, but she provided them with many hours of quality television."},

{"title": "Why Is TCM Showing Noir Alley So Late on Saturday Night?", "date": "Thursday, September 9, 2021", "text": "Ever since it first began airing on Turner Classic Movies, I have been a huge fan of Noir Alley, the programming block dedicated to film noir. While Noir Alley originally only aired at 9:00 AM Central on Sunday, they eventually began showing it at 11:00 PM Central on Saturday as well. Given I am not a morning person, I have preferred watching Noir Alley on Saturday night ever since TCM started doing so. Indeed, I am usually just waking up at 9:00 AM on any given day of the week!Unfortunately, of late TCM has been showing Noir Alley later than 11:00 Central on Saturday night. Three out of the four airings of Noir Alley in July did not begin until 11:30 PM Central. Last week, once again, Noir Alley did not air until 11:30 PM on Saturday. This week is even worse. Noir Alley won't air until 12:00 Midnight Central. While I am willing to stay up late those times when TCM shows Noir Alley at 11:30 PM on Saturday, 12:00 Midnight is a bit late even for me. My choices seem to be either to DVR it or get up early Sunday morning to watch it.I know for a fact that I am not the only person who doesn't like it when Noir Alley airs later than 11:00 PM on Saturday, as I have seen others complain about it on Twitter as well. And, going by the number of TCMParty participants on Twitter, I think they might well have more viewers for the Saturday night showing of Noir Alley than they do the Sunday morning showing. The TCMParties for Noir Alley are always bigger on Saturday night than they are on Sunday morning, sometimes much bigger. I would think that TCM would then want to take advantage of the huge audience for noir on Saturday night and air Noir Alley consistently at 11:00 PM Central. Of course, as displeased as I am with TCM airing Noir Alley late on Saturday night, I know much of why they have been doing so. Quite simply it is the fact that TCM has been showing two movies over 120 minutes regularly on Saturday night. For instance, this Saturday they are showing To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) followed by The Hustler (1961). Because both films clock in at over two hours, that pushes Noir Alley back to a much later time slot. While I love both To Kill a Mockingbird and The Hustler (To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favourite movies of all time), I would much prefer TCM only showed one of the two movies on Saturday night and followed it with a shorter movie so that Noir Alley begins on time. If TCM wants to show two big movies back to back, they can always do so on another night of the week when there is no regularly scheduled, late night programming that will be disrupted.Anyway, I hate complaining about TCM and I often think we should be thankful that we have it at all. That having been said, airing Noir Alley late seems to have become a regular occurrence of late and it is starting to grate on my nerves. When Noir Alley only aired on Sunday morning, I sometimes missed it because I overslept. It would be much easier if I could simply tune in at 11:00 on Saturday night and watch it before I go to bed as I usually do."},
{"title": "Rob Roy (1995)", "date": "Wednesday, September 8, 2021", "text": "When it comes to Scottish folk heroes, only a few are better known than Rob Roy McGregor, most often referred to only as \"Rob Roy.\" A cattleman by trade, he borrowed a good deal of money to enlarge his herd. Unfortunately, his chief herdsman disappeared, which led Rob Roy to default on his loan. This led to him being labelled an outlaw. It was after  James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose seized Rob Roy's property that Rob Roy began a feud against the Duke. Another version of the story is that Rob Roy's property was seized following the Jacobite Uprising of 1715 and that the Duke of Montrose bought the property in 1720 from the Commissioners of Enquiry. Either way, Rob Roy continued his feud against the Duke of Montrose  until 1722. In doing so he would attain fame that lasts to this day. Indeed, it was in 1723 that The Highland Rogue, a fictionalized story about Rob Roy was published. Sir Walter Scott's 1817 work Rob Roy would only add to his fame.Since then there have been several works about Rob Roy, of which the 1995 movie Rob Roy might be the most famous. With regards to film, there were two adaptations before the 1995 film. Rob Roy (1922) was released in the silent era. Walt Disney also made a film based on Rob Roy's story, Rob Roy: The Highland Rogue (1953). Rob Roy (1995) was very loosely based on the novel Rob Roy by Sir Walter Scott and it did depart from history a good deal as well.While Rob Roy (1995) wasn't particularly faithful to Sir Walter Scott's book or Rob Roy's actual life, it was shot in actual locations in Scotland. Among the locations were Glen Coe, Glen Tarbert, Drummond Castle, Crichton Castle, Rannoch Moor, and many others. Some of the locations in the Highlands could only be accessed by helicopter.If the locations in Rob Roy were all genuinely Scottish, it must be pointed out that its leading man wasn't. Playing Rob Roy was Liam Neeson, who was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. While Liam Neeson is Irish, he did do a fine job of speaking with a Scottish accent in Rob Roy. His usual County Antrim accent isn't to be heard. Rob Roy wasn't the first movie based on folkore in which Liam Neeson had starred. One of his earliest roles was Sir Gawain in Excalibur (1981).Rob Roy (1995) may have been unfaithful to Sir Walter Scott's work. It may have departed from history a good deal. Its leading man wasn't even Scottish. That having been said, it did receive largely positive reviews upon its release on April 7 1995. Roger Ebert described it as \"...a splendid, rousing historical adventure...\" The critic at Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+. What is more, Rob Roy has its fans to this day. Some of us even consider far superior to another 1995 Scottish film that just happened to win the Oscar for Best Picture.While Roy Roy does depart from history, it features some great performances by Liam Neeson, Sir John Hurt, and Tim Roth. What is more, the script goes far more in depth on the characters than many historical adventure movies have before it. The sword fight at the climax ranks among the best ever made, easily matching those in Scaramouche (1952) and Ladyhawke (1985). Rob Roy isn't particularly well remembered today, but it really should be."},

He appeared in the films The Animal (2001), Island Prey (2001), Donzi: The Legend (2001), Missing Brendan (2003), The Commission (2003), Happily Even After (2004), Crab Orchard (2005), All In (2005), Ways of the Flesh (2006), Hard Four (2007), Gigantic (2008), Christmas Cottage (2008), Channels (2008), and  Not Another B Movie (2010). He was the narrator for The Triumphs of William Henry Harrison (2009).In the Teens Ed Asner appeared in the films Hopelessly in June (2011), Absolute Killers (2011), Let Go (2011), Identical (2011), Should've Been Romeo (2012), Foodfight! (2012), Elephant Sighs (2012), Audrey (2014), The Games Maker (2014), Citizens United (2015), Love Meet Hope (2016), Stars in Shorts: No Ordinary Love (2016), Boonville Redemption (2016), Joe's War (2017), In Vino (2017), Yamasong: March of the Hollows (2017), The Gliksmans (2017), Saving Christmas (2017), Santa Stole Our Dog: A Merry Doggone Christmas! (2017), Waiting in the Wings: Still Waiting (2018), The Parting Glass (2018), Angels on Tap (2018), Honor Among Men (2018), Barking Mad (2018), The Garden Left Behind (2019), Faith, Hope & Love (2019), M.O.M.: Mother of All Monsters (2019), Rain Beau's End (2020), and Senior Entourage (2021). He provided voices for the movies Frozen in Time (2014) and CarGo (2017). There are about three yet to be released films featuring Ed Asner that have either been completed or are in post production. Ed Asner was the President of the Screen Actors Guild from 1981 to 1985. He was also a member of several non-profit organizations, including the Survivor Mitzvah Project, the Comic Book Legal Defence Fund, and Defenders of Wildlife, among others. Ed Asner worked as an actor for around seventy years and he was nothing if not prolific. Of course, the very reason that Mr. Asner could be so prolific is that he was also very good. There can be no doubt that he will always be remembered as Lou Grant from The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant. It was his talent that turned Lou Grant into one of the most memorable characters on American television. He played many other roles throughout his career, some of which were very different from Lou Grant. He was the villain in the John Wayne Western El Dorado, wealthy landowner Bart Jason. It was a role about as far from Mr. Grant as one could get. He excelled as Captain Davies, the slave ship commander who was tormented by his conscience, in the mini-series Roots. On Hawaii Five-O (and its reboot, Hawaii Five-0), he played the smuggler August March. Among his best roles was Carl Fredrickson in Up. He took a role that could have simply been played as a grumpy old man and gave Carl pathos. It was one of the best performances ever given by a voice actor.On Pixar's social media accounts, the studio said of Ed Asner that he was \"...our real life Carl Fredrickson: a veneer of a grouch over an incredibly kind and loving human being.\" His castmates and others who had met him throughout his life echoed Pixar's sentiments, not only recognizing him as an acting legend but a very kind man. I have friends who had the opportunity to meet Ed Asner and all of them echo those same sentiments. Ed Asner was a kind, thoughtful man with a great heart and a great sense of humour. Indeed, one of my friends told how when SAG had an open house in the Eighties, Ed Asner as the union's president stood at the door and welcomed every single guest. Ed Asner was a truly great actor and a fine gentleman as well."},
{"title": "The 10th Anniversary of #TCMParty", "date": "Friday, September 3, 2021", "text": "Today is the 10th anniversary of TCMParty. For those of you who are wondering what TCMParty is, it is a collective live tweet of movies on Turner Classic Movies using the hashtag #TCMParty. \"TCMParty\" is also used of the group of TCM fans who tweet using that hashtag. In the beginning TCMParties were scheduled and had hosts who tweet trivia about the specific movie then airing. Essentially, they curated the live tweet. While there are still scheduled TCMParties with hosts, over time TCMParty has evolved to where it takes place 24 hours a day and often without a host. Since that very first TCMParty on September 3 2011, TCMParty has become an established part of Turner Classic Movies fandom. TCM has announced TCMParties on their official Twitter account and TCM hosts have served as hosts of TCMParties. On the occasion of the 5th anniversary of TCMParty, Turner Classic Movies celebrated along with the rest of us. Today TCM released a video recognizing the 10th anniversary.While TCMParty would become the best known collective live tweet of movies on Turner Classic Movies, it was by no means the first. In June 2011 TCM scheduled classic drive-in movies each Thursday of that month. With a block of giant insect movies airing on June 9 2011, then, a group of TCM fans live tweeted to the films using the hashtag #TCMBugOut. That night fans then live tweeted to Them! (1954), Tarantula (1955), The Cosmic Monsters (1958), The Black Scorpion (1957), and The Wasp Woman (1959). I remember I live tweeted to Them! until my power went out, although I was unaware of the hashtag #TCMBugOut until after the fact.Of course, the following Thursday Turner Classic Movies aired drive-in movies in other genres, so the hashtag #TCMBugOut was then no longer appropriate. For the following Thursdays, then, the hashtag #TCMDriveIn was used. While #TCMDriveIn ceased being used at the end of June 2011, after which TCM wasn't showing drive-in movies every month, it would give rise to the #DriveInMob, a collective live tweet every Thursday to a classic drive-in movie (not just the ones showed on TCM).As to TCMParty, it was Kathleen Callaway, who was using the Twitter handle hockmangirl at the time, who came up with the idea. Here it must be noted that Kathleen was unaware of #TCMBugOut and #TCMDriveIn at the time she conceived TCMParty. Anyway, like many TCM fans at the time (including myself), Kathleen would live tweet movies on Turner Classic Movies. She decided live tweeting to movies on TCM would be easier if there was a hashtag with which fans could keep track of all the tweets. It was then Kathleen Callway who was the first TCMParty host, choosing a specific movie from the schedule and then letting everyone know that there would be a TCM Party for that particular film. It was then on September 3 2011 that the first TCMParty was held to the classic Casablanca (1942).In October 2011 the name most associated with TCMParty joined as a host: Paula Guthat. Paula's impact on TCMParty would be such that she is usually counted as its co-founder. It was after Paula began hosting that it was decided that TCMParty should have its own Twitter account. Since tcmparty was already taken, it was then decided to use the handle TCM_Party. Not long afterwards Tumblr and Facebook pages were created for TCMParty as well.TCMParty would see changes in its hosts over time. Kathleen Callway left in March 2012 to concentrate on her handicrafts and animal rescue. Paula had convinced silent movie Trevor Jost to guest host the F. W. Murnau movie Sunrise (1927). With Kathleen's departure, Trevor then became TCMParty's newest host. It would be later that Joel Williams, the name most associated with TCMParty besides Paula Guthat, would become a host. Of course, there have been a number of guest hosts over the years. Illeana Douglas guest hosted on Friday nights in May 2013 when she was hosting the TCM programming block Second Looks. Other TCM hosts have also guest hosted movies on TCMParty, including Eddie Muller and Professor Jacqueline Stewart. Beyond TCM hosts, there have also been TCMParties hosted by various film historians and journalists. I have been a guest host several times and I seem to be the default host any time TCM shows A Hard Day's Night (1964) or British New Wave films.To this day there are still movies chosen from the Turner Classic Movies schedule for \"official\" TCMParties. These scheduled live tweets are usually hosted by one of the TCMParty hosts (Paula or Joel) or a guest host. Eventually TCMParty would evolve to where informal TCMParties are going on 24 hours a day. Sometimes during these informal TCMParties someone will act as a host, live tweeting trivia, but more often than not there is no host at all.Fortunately, TCMParty has had very little trouble with trolls over the past ten years. This is fortunate as there is very little TCMPartiers can do to stop trolls from using the hashtag beyond reporting their tweets and blocking them. For a time we did have a problem with spammers using the hashtag. In the summer of 2012 a bunch of porn sites began misusing #TCMParty. A bunch of us spent the best of two days reporting them until it stopped. In 2012 there was a stranger sort of spam whereby fake accounts would steal tweets and tweet them. Many of these tweets were from TCMParty. While none of us could figure out what their end game was, we reported them nonetheless. Fortunately, that stopped after a time as well. Since then Twitter has improved its security so that bots and spammers usually don't last long. Except for the rare porn site misusing the hashtag, we haven't had many problems since.Over the years we have had celebrities who have taken part in TCMParties. Not only have TCM hosts guest hosted TCMParties, but they have also been participants. I cannot say who the first celebrity was who took part in TCMParty, but I know two of our original members were celebrities. Legendary songbird Monica Lewis live tweeted along with TCMParty nearly from the beginning until her death at the age of 93 in 2015. Vanessa Marquez, best known for playing Ana Delgado in the classic movie Stand and Deliver (1988) and Nurse Wendy Goldman on the hit TV show ER, was another original TCMParty member. She was so beloved by TCMPartiers that Paula Guthat referred to her as \"the Sweetheart of TCMParty.\" Illeana Douglas has taken part even when she wasn't hosting. Stephen Bogart, the son of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, has also taken part in TCMParties.The legendary Mitzi Gaynor has taken part in TCMParty from time to time as well. Sadly, in the past ten years there have been TCMPartiers who have died. I am not absolutely certain, but I believe Monica Lewis was the first. She died on June 12 2015 at the age of 93. She had only been tweeting to #TCMParty three days before she died. Vanessa Marquez's death was well publicized beyond TCMParty and I really do not want to go into it here. Suffice it to say that the Sweetheart of TCMParty was greatly mourned by its members and she is still missed to this day. Also still missed is Andrea Rosen, who died in March 2019. She had attended multiple TCM Classic Film Festivals and was a regular at the TCM Parties for Noir Alley. Greg McCambley was associated not just with the hashtag #TCMParty, but the hashtags #Bond_Age and  #BMovieManiacs, and  live tweets associated with classic TV shows from Columbo to Kolchak: The Night Stalker. He died of COVID-19 on March 27 2021. Richard C. Rosen, the widower of Andrea Rosen, died on April 12 2021. Like Andrea, he regularly attended the TCM Classic Film Festival and was well loved by his fellow TCM fans. I know that there have to have been other TCMParty members who have died in the past ten years and I must apologize for not mentioning them. TCMParty has grown to the point that it is hard to keep track of everyone who has participated in it. I will raise a glass in memory of all those who have participated in TCMParty and have passed on.As I said earlier, I have been a participant in TCMParty since its early days. While I had been aware of #TCMParty for quite some time, it was not until around 7:10 PM on December 15 2011 that I would make my first tweet using the hashtag: \"I'm watching The Bishop's Wife right now. I suspect most women would gladly have an angel like Cary Grant around. LOL. #TCMParty.\" I didn't tweet much during The Bishop's Wife that night, but the TCMParty for The Thin Man movies on December 22 2011 would be a different matter. I had a bit of a baptism in fire that night as I live tweeted to The Thin Man (1934), After the Thin Man (1936), and Another Thin Man (1939) using the hashtag #TCMParty. My first stint as guest host for a TCMParty came on March 11 2012 when I hosted Bedazzled (1967). Since then I have guest hosted several times. I hosted an entire month of British New Wave movies. I have also hosted A Hard Day's Night multiple times. On September 30 2020 I hosted Stand and Deliver (1988), which was perhaps my most emotional guest host stint of them all. It was a bit overwhelming seeing all the love for my dearest friend. Vanessa Marquez, who played Ana Delgado in the film. Ben Mankiewicz interviewed Edward James Olmos before the movie, but as far as TCMParty was concerned, Vanessa was the star.Of course, as much as I enjoy being a guest host for TCMParty, I think the real fun is in just participating. There are many TCMParties I remember well. Among my favourite TCMParties took place on May 23 2003 when Turner  Classic Movies aired The Loved One (1965) as part of their Second Looks block. As I mentioned earlier, Illeana Douglas was guest host that night. She tweeted so much she landed in Twitter jail and had to switch to an alternative account to continue. Some of the rest of us landed in Twitter jail for tweeting too much as well. The Loved One is one of my favourite comedies and one that is so wild that it is perfect for live tweeting. I also remember February 1 2014 when TCM showed Oscar nominees from 1939 in honour of that year's 75th anniversary. I live tweeted nearly all day long to such movies as Wuthering Heights, The Wizard of Oz, and Gone With the Wind. Another memorable TCMParty came when I was part of TCM's Fan Favourite series and got to introduce A Hard Day's Night with Ben Mankiewicz on April 11 2015. I always enjoy hosting A Hard Day's Night, but that day was particularly special as I was actually on TCM. Finally, the aforementioned TCMParty for Stand and Deliver may be my all time favourite, for obvious reasons.TCMParty has a profound impact on my life. I met many of my closest friends, including co-founder Paula Guthat, through TCMParty. In fact, I have so many close friends from TCMParty that I dare not try to list all of them as I fear I might miss someone. It was through TCMParty and live tweeting to the TV show Mad Men that I met Vanessa Marquez. For me she wasn't just Ana Delgado and Nurse Wendy Goldman or even the Sweetheart of #TCMParty. She was my dearest friend and a woman I absolutely adored. When she was murdered, I don't think I would have survived without my friends at TCMParty. They have been there not just through Vanessa's death, but through many other events in my life. I owe each and every one of my TCMParty friends so much. I have to believe that it is also because of TCMParty that I was chosen as one of the Fan Favourite co-hosts, and I honestly believe hits on my blog have gone up because of TCMParty. I know I am not alone in the impact TCMParty has had on my life. It is through TCMParty that many people have made friends, made contacts, and even found love. TCMParty ceased being a collective live tweet to movies on Turner Classic Movies long ago. It has become a close knit community of TCM fans who support each other through thick and thin. I think I can speak for all TCMParty members when I say that it has made our lives all the more richer."},
{"title": "Turner Classic Movie's New Look", "date": "Wednesday, September 1, 2021", "text": "Today Turner Classic Movies unveiled what it is calling \"a network rebrand.\" It includes a new logo for TCM itself, new logos for TCM's programming blocks (including Noir Alley), new sets, and a new tagline. From what I have seen on Twitter and Facebook, reaction to the new look has been mixed. Some fans like everything about the new look. Others like some aspects of the new look, but not others (for instance, they might like the new sets, but not the logo). Yet others hate everything about the new look. For any fans worried that Turner Classic Movies might be changing, I have to point out that the network rebrand is cosmetic. TCM is going to continue as it always has, showing classic movies uncut and commercial free 24 hours a day. According to a Turner Classic Movies press release, the network rebrand is meant to reflect \"... the evolution in the way modern audiences are engaging with classic movies.\" Pola Changnon, general manager of TCM, said of the network rebrand, \"Our new look better reflects the vibrant brand and respected industry authority that TCM has become over the years, with an eye toward the future. Fans can still enjoy the same curated classic film experience, now presented with a bold new energy that reflects today’s audience.\"I have to admit that I am one of those people who has mixed feeling about Turner Classic Movies' network rebrand. I love the new tagline, \"Where Then Meets Now.\" I think it perfectly summarizes what TCM is and always has been. It is much superior to \"Let's Movie,\" a tagline I have always disliked (the use of nouns as verbs grates on my nerves).I also like what I have seen the new sets. While the sets are supposed to be in \"a more contemporary direction,\" from what I have seen they have a bit of a Mid-Century Modern look. For me that is perfect for a channel that shows classic movies. Indeed, they remind me of my childhood.What I don't like about the network rebrand are the new logos. The new TCM logo isn't too bad, but to me it is inferior to the classic logo. In fact, I don't think it \"better reflects the vibrant brand and respected industry authority that TCM has become over the years.\" What is more, it seems to me to look less contemporary than the classic logo. While I might warm to the new logo (even if I will never love it like I do the old logo), I seriously dislike the new logo for Noir Alley. It is too bright for a programming block devoted to film noir. They really should have either stuck with the classic logo or gone with something darker. Quite simply, they should have gone with something more, well, noir. I do hope they continue to make the classic TCM and Noir Alley logos available on merchandise. I really don't want T-shirts or coffee mugs with the new logos.TCM also has a new sonic identity, but I have yet to hear it (I haven't watched TCM yet today), so I don't have an opinion on it. I do hope they did a better job with the new sounds than they did the logos!I do have to say that while I have mixed feelings about the network rebrand,  I will continue to be an avid TCM fan and loyal viewer. Turner Classic Movies is still the best channel out there, even if its logo might be less appealing than some others."},
{"title": "The Media and Vanessa Marquez", "date": "Monday, August 30, 2021", "text": "Today it has been three years since South Pasadena police officers shot my beloved friend Vanessa Marquez in the back and killed her. It was truly the worst day of my life and I have been grieving her ever since. One of the hardest things I have had to deal with since Vanessa's murder has been the portrayal of both Vanessa and the events that happened that day in the media. From the beginning the City of South Pasadena developed a narrative in which Vanessa was undergoing a mental health crisis and essentially committed suicide by cop. It is a narrative I know to be false. Sadly, many media outlets would embrace this false narrative and accept it as being true. Even three years later, after protests from Vanessa's friends and plenty of evidence contradicting South Pasadena's narrative, there are still many media outlets that at least accept a portion of this narrative. Just last week both KABC in Los Angeles and Newsweek claimed that Vanessa suffered from \"mental health issues (KABC also reported that the police had been called to make a wellness check, when it was the paramedics who were called to treat her for seizures, something I know for a fact as I am the one who made the call).\"For those of you who may be unfamiliar with Vanessa Marquez, she was an actress perhaps best known for the classic movie Stand and Deliver (1988) and the hit TV show ER. She grew up in Montebello, California and decided she wanted to be an actress when she was only three or four after seeing The Wizard of Oz (1939). Her big break came when she was cast as Ana Delgado in Stand and Deliver. Afterwards her career took off with guest appearances on such TV shows as Tequila and Bonetti and Seinfeld. She was set to have a recurring role on the television show Wiseguy, but the show was cancelled and her episodes never aired. Those episodes would later become available on DVD. She was a regular on the television show Culture Clash, starring the legendary comedy troupe of the same name. It was in 1994 that she began a three year run as Nurse Wendy Goldman on ER. At the time Vanessa's star seemed to be on the rise, and she appeared at such events as the NBC All-Star Reception in 1995 and the Red Cross Spirit Awards in 1996. She also appeared in the fashion sections of various tabloids. Vanessa would only have a few more credits on screen following ER. She made three guest appearances on the TV show Malcolm & Eddie and in the TV movie Fire & Ice.Sadly, Vanessa's stint on ER was not entirely pleasant. She experienced sexual harassment on the set. According to Vanessa, when she complained about the harassment she was fired. She said she was subsequently blacklisted, having been labelled what can be the absolute worst thing with which an actress could be labelled. Quite simply, she was called \"difficult.\"Vanessa Marquez's life would only seem to go from bad to worse. She was diagnosed with refractory coeliac disease. If that was not bad enough, she would eventually develop common variable immune deficiency, fibromyalgia, and osteoporosis. Vanessa was also a compulsive shopper. It was because of this that she appeared on the second episode of the reality show Intervention in 2005.Sadly, following her murder, Vanessa's episode of Intervention has been used as \"proof\" that she suffered from mental health issues.  In particular, a scene in which she expresses a desire to end her life while driving has been repeatedly brought up. There are several reasons why Intervention should not be brought up when discussing the death of Vanessa Marquez. The first is that the Intervention episode was filmed in 2005, a full thirteen years before her death. In that amount of time most human beings will change and evolve, and Vanessa was no different. The \"Vanessa Marquez of 2005\" was markedly different from the \"Vanessa Marquez of 2018.\" The Vanessa I knew for all those years was a much more stable and happier person than the one in Intervention, although, by her own admission, she still suffered from compulsive shopping disorder.Second, when the Intervention episode was filmed, Vanessa was at what might have been the lowest point in her life. She had not worked as an actress in three years. She had only recently been diagnosed with refractory coeliac disease. I have to think she was also suffering from post-traumatic stress due to the sexual harassment she had received during her career. Filmed at the lowest point in their life, most people would not come off well. In 2008 my employer at the time transferred me into what was generally considered the worst department at work. As a result I developed what is known as an adjustment disorder. I hate to think how I would have looked to other people had a reality TV show crew filmed my life at the time. Given I am much better now, I would hate to be judged by how I was then. Third, it must be taken into account that Intervention is a reality show. While the show has received some acclaim (including two Emmy Awards), it has also received its share of criticism. No less than Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe has said that the show is exploitative. He also pointed out that the interventions themselves are played up for their drama value. I know for a fact that Vanessa was told she was going to appear in a documentary about addiction (not a reality show) and did not know about the intervention that was to occur beforehand. As someone who minored  in psychology in college, that strikes me as downright unethical. Finally, I have to address the fact that Vanessa Marquez is said to suffer from bipolar disorder in this episode. I honestly have to wonder if she had been misdiagnosed as being bipolar. My brother has bipolar disorder II and I discussed this with Vanessa multiple times. I would have thought had she been bipolar she would have then mentioned it. She certainly knew I would not judge her or think less of her for it. The fact that she never mentioned being bipolar to me makes me think that she was not. If Vanessa had indeed been misdiagnosed as bipolar, the drugs used to treat the disorder could explain some of her behaviour on Intervention. For example, Risperidone can have such side effects as anxiety, agitation, restlessness, and even mania. I once took some of my brother's Risperidone by accident (it resembled my sinus medication) and I was so out of it that day I had to leave work. The next day I told my boss what happened and we both laughed about it, but the effects of an atypical antipsychotic on someone who does not have a psychosis really aren't something to laugh about.  Regardless,  studies have shown that unipolar depression has been misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder has also been misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder. It seems likely to me that Vanessa may have had  post-traumatic stress that was mistaken for bipolar disorder.While Vanessa was at her lowest point when the Intervention episode was filmed, she would recover. She suffered from agoraphobia in the early to mid-Naughts, but by the late Naughts she was able to get out again. When Jaimie Escalante, the calculus teacher portrayed in Stand and Deliver, was diagnosed with cancer, Vanessa was relentless in raising funds for his medical treatment. In this capacity she was interviewed by various Los Angeles news outlets. She became active in Star Wars fandom again and began attending Star Wars conventions. She was even interviewed by KTLA for Star Wars Day in 2010. Before her declining health would limit her physical activity, she was an avid swing dancer and even led swing dancing groups. After we had first encountered each other, she attended John Williams concerts and went to see Al Pacino at the Pasadena Playhouse with a friend.  The year of her death she went to see the Batman '66 exhibit at the Hollywood Museum. It was in the late Naughts that Vanessa became active on social media and made many friends that way. She was an original member of TCMParty, the group who live tweets to movies on Turner Classic Movies using that hashtag.Of course, while in many ways her life had improved from what it had been in 2005, her physical health would decline. In 2014 she set up an online fundraiser to raise money for her medical costs. Sadly, despite the fact that Vanessa had played Ana Delgado on Stand and Deliver and Nurse Wendy Goldman on ER and had raised money for Jaimie Escalante, the media never took notice of her fundraiser.The media did take notice in October 2017 when on Twitter Vanessa retweeted an article in which George Clooney spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced producer who had been accused of multiple accounts of sexual misconduct, and accused George Clooney on Twitter of helping blacklist her after she complained about sexual harassment on the set of ER. As to Clooney, he pleaded ignorance that Vanessa had been blacklisted in the first place and said that as he was only an actor, he had nothing to do with casting on ER. To his credit, he did say that he \"took her at her word\" with regards to Vanessa being blacklisted. At the time, the media seemed to take neither Vanessa Marquez's side nor George Clooney's side for the most part, simply reporting what each had said. Sadly, Vanessa's Twitter account would be suspended, even though she had only complained about sexual harassment and said that she was blacklisted. Vanessa was not the only woman to have her Twitter account suspended after protesting about sexual harassment. Rose McGowan also had her Twitter account suspended, as reportedly have less famous women (for my part I complained to both Twitter support and, in an email, to Jack Dorsey himself about the suspension of Vanessa's account). Following Vanessa's death some media outlets would resurrect the story of Vanessa's accusations about Clooney, as if it was yet more \"proof\" that she had \"mental health issues.\"Sadly, it was on August 30 2018 that Vanessa Marquez was shot and killed by officers from the South Pasadena Police Department. The City of South Pasadena was swift in developing the aforementioned narrative in which Vanessa was undergoing a \"mental heath crisis\" and pointed a BB gun at officers. The fact of the matter is that day Vanessa was suffering from severe seizures. She asked me to call the South Pasadena Fire Department to send paramedics. The truth is, then, that paramedics were called to treat Vanessa for a medical emergency, not to make a \"wellness check\" or because she was having a \"mental health crisis.\" As to Vanessa pointing a BB gun at police officers, considerable doubt has since emerged that she ever did. Indeed, the Complaint for Damages filed on behalf of Vanessa's mother Delia with the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central District on June 24 2020 labelled the claim that Vanessa ever drew a BB gun on officers as false. I also cannot stress this enough. Vanessa Marquez was not suicidal. Despite her health at the time, Vanessa still maintained a positive outlook on life. If she had been suicidal, she could have simply taken an overdose of her seizure medications at any time. Any claims coming out of South Pasadena that she was suicidal should then be treated with suspicion. Sadly, many media outlets embraced the false narrative created by the City of South Pasadena wholeheartedly. Here I must point out that there were media outlets that reported Vanessa's death with responsibility and even with sympathy for Vanessa. They mentioned that Vanessa was having seizures and that paramedics had been called there to treat her for them. Many of the same outlets mentioned that Vanessa suffered from refractory coeliac disease. They also made an effort to interview many of her friends. The morning of August 31 I had several requests for interviews, but I ignored all of them as I was still crying after hours of having not slept at all. It would be that afternoon that I consented to be interviewed by the Associated Press, even though I was still pretty much out of it. Some media outlets were responsible with regards to reporting South Pasadena's version of events, making sure to stress that South Pasadena's account was allegedly what happened. Among the more responsible media outlets reporting on Vanessa's death were KTLA, Latin Heat, and, of all things, the South Pasadena High School newspaper The Tiger. The three of them have treated Vanessa's case with dignity, sensitivity, and sympathy.Unfortunately, there were many media outlets that simply embraced South Pasadena's narrative of what happened. This was particularly true of The South Pasadena Review, which still embraces the city's narrative to this day, even though they have been informed of the truth repeatedly. Even the generally responsible Los Angeles Times portrayed Vanessa as having a \"mental health crisis,\" thereby leading credence to the false claim that she committed \"suicide by cop.\" Some even failed to mention that she was having seizures and went entirely with the idea that police were there on a \"wellness check.' Many failed to mention that she had refractory coeliac disease. Virtually no media outlets reported the fact that Vanessa had been shot in the back, something made clear in the  Los Angeles County Department of the Medical Examiner-Coroner's autopsy report as of September 3 2018.  Some media outlets reported a claim by Sgt. Joe Mendoza of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department that Vanessa had an eating disorder. I don't know where Sgt. Mendoza got his information, but it was false. Vanessa never had an eating disorder. Because she had refractory coeliac disease, on top of of a high metabolism, she had difficulty gaining weight. She actually want to gain a few pounds, not lose them. Some would even go so far as to downplay Vanessa's career, behaving as if she was a bit player on ER when in truth Vanessa's character appeared in the majority of episodes of the first three seasons and even had entire subplots dedicated to her. In the end, the \"Vanessa\" portrayed in some media reports about her death resembled the sweet, loving, intelligent woman I knew so little that they might as well have been reporting on an entirely different person.Sadly, despite the fact that Vanessa was a well-loved actress who had appeared in the classic film Stand and Deliver and the hit TV series ER, she was left out of many in memoriam tributes. She was left out of the Emmy Awards' on-air in memoriam. Even though ER was a big hit on NBC, she was left out of the in memoriam that aired on The NBC Evening News. She was even left out of the SAG Awards on-air in memoriam, even though she was technically a SAG Award winner as ER had won Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 1996 and Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 1997 when she was on the show (she even got to go up on stage with the rest of the cast to accept the award). Turner Classic Movies did include Vanessa in their annual TCM Remembers at the end of the year. What is more, they gave her something of a place of honour. She appears right after one of the breaks in the video, so that there is no way anyone could miss her. Of course, it must be pointed out that Vanessa was a huge TCM fan, an original member of the aforementioned #TCMParty, and was loved not only by her fellow TCM fans, but by the staff (including the hosts) of TCM itself. It was because of the fact that Vanessa Marquez had been overlooked in so many In Memoriam tributes that her co-star from Stand and Deliver Lydia Nicole (who played Rafaela in the film) created a petition to include Vanessa in the Oscars' on-air In Memoriam reel. The petition would eventually attract media attention and as a result the first truly positive news stories about Vanessa since her death. Even The Los Angeles Times, who had previously embraced South Pasadena's false narrative, published a wonderful article about Vanessa. Sadly, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Science elected not to include Vanessa in the on-air In Memoriam reel. That fact also made the news and generated more sympathy for Vanessa in the press. The petition ultimately reached over  12,000 signatures, which I think proves once and for all how loved by her fans Vanessa truly was.The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Report on Vanessa's death was released on March 2 2020, notably the day before the Los Angeles District Attorney Election (an election that resulted in a run-off election in November that District Attorney Jackie Lacey would ultimately lose). The report came to the conclusion that the officers acted in self defence and defence of others. This is despite the fact that, as is even acknowledged in the report itself, according to the Los Angles County Department of the Medical Examiner-Coroner's autopsy report Vanessa was shot in the back, shedding considerable doubt regarding the District Attorney Office's conclusion. Of course, there are also many, many other flaws with the District Attorney Office's report on Vanessa's death. For instance, it identifies me as as a \"woman from Alabama\" (I am a man from Missouri) and falsely claims I said, \"Vanessa was not acting right\" (I said no such thing). It also relies far too much on the testimony of one of the officers who murdered Vanessa, an officer who would have much to lose if he was found to have acted for any other reason than self defence. Indeed, there are so many flaws with the District Attorney's report on Vanessa's death that I wrote an entire blog post tearing the report apart, \"Justice for Vanessa Marquez.\" It seems clear to me that the District Attorney Office's report on Vanessa's death was in no way fair and unbiased. Here it must be noted that historically police unions had contributed millions of dollars to political action committees supporting Jackie Lacey. Perhaps because of this, she would almost always refuse to prosecute police officers throughout her career as Los Angeles County District Attorney. It should then perhaps be no surprise that the Los Angeles District Attorney's Report on Vanessa's death should be so filled with flaws and inaccuracies. In fact, I think then District Attorney Jackie Lacey knew that the report would not stand up to close scrutiny, which is why it was released the day before the election. She knew that a report so flawed could lead to her losing the election. As it is, she lost the runoff election anyway. The same time that the District Attorney Office's report was released, so too did South Pasadena release a six minute, edited video of the body cam footage of Vanessa's death. Here I must state that they did this without warning Vanessa's mother Delia ahead of time, nor anyone else who knew and loved Vanessa. Now as a matter of full disclosure, I must say that I have never watched the video for the simple reason that I think doing so would push me over the edge. That having been said, those people I know who have watched it said that it proves the police officers in Vanessa's apartment on August 30 2018 behaved incompetently, unprofessionally, and irresponsibly. Will Gotay, who played Pancho in Stand and Deliver, said after viewing the six minute footage, \"...what I saw for myself on the BodyCam footage was undeniably wrong!” He also said that the police officers \"...need to be held responsible for what they have done\" and bluntly, \"They murdered my friend.\" I know of no one who has seen the video who believes that the police acted in self-defence or that they even behaved competently or professionally or responsibly. Now there would be media outlets that would question both the District Attorney Office's report and the bodycam footage. Some even went to the trouble of interviewing Vanessa's friends to get their reactions, all of who disapproved of the report. Unfortunately, many media outlets accepted the District Attorney Office's report as gospel and somehow ignored that the bodycam footage showed the police present on August 30 2018 acted incompetently, unprofessionally, and irresponsibly. In fact, some less responsible, less reliable media outlets claimed that the bodycam showed Vanessa pointed a BB gun at the officers, when it shows no such thing (they apparently did not watch the video). Some even repeated the aforementioned false claim by Sgt. Mendoza of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department that Vanessa had an eating disorder. The tabloids seemed to have a field day with the Los Angeles County DA's Report and the bodycam footage. The Daily Mail  published a particularly reprehensible article in which they not only portrayed the police who murdered Vanessa as \"heroes\" (in my opinion they are complete and utter cowards), but had the bodycam footage set to autoplay on the article's webpage. I found having the bodycam footage on autoplay particularly reprehensible, as it could well trigger post-traumatic stress in those of who love Vanessa. I wrote The Daily Mail a very angry email in which I reminded them of their support of Fascism in the 1930s and stated flatly, \"You haven't changed much.\" They never replied, but they at least published an article much, much more sympathetic to Vanessa when her mother filed her lawsuit. The tabloid television show Inside Edition also did a reprehensible story in which they referred to Vanessa as \"mentally disturbed\" and even included some of the bodycam footage. I also wrote Inside Edition an angry email in which I informed them I would never watch their show again. They never replied and did not even bother to cover the lawsuit Vanessa's mother filed against South Pasadena or the settlement she received thereafter.It was on June 24 2020 that a  Complaint for Damages was filed with the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central District on behalf of Vanessa's mother against the City of South Pasadena and the South Pasadena Police Department. The complaint shed yet further doubt that the officers who murdered Vanessa Marquez acted in \"self defence and defence of others.\" It was as a result that media coverage of Vanessa's death would become more sympathetic, to the point that some outlets even questioned what the police officers did in Vanessa's apartment on August 30 2018 overall. It was in February of this year that a settlement was reached in the wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of Vanessa's mother. Unfortunately, it was only for  $450,000. As far as I a concerned, it should have been for much, much more.Sadly, even following the settlement in the wrongful death lawsuit, there are still media outlets that insist Vanessa suffered from \"mental health issues,\" the aforementioned stories from KABC and Newsweek last week being perfect examples. Now it is true that Vanessa never overcame her compulsive shopping and I have to think she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, which are technically \"mental health issues.\" The problem is that when a newspaper or TV station uses the phrase \"mental health issues,\" laymen are apt to think of outright psychoses, mental disorders in which an individual has lost touch with reality. I will say this now. Not only was Vanessa not suicidal. She was not psychotic either. Saying she suffered from \"mental health issues\" then seems unwarranted. When Vanessa was murdered by South Pasadena police officers on August 30 2018, I thought surely the media would treat her story with sympathy and dignity. After all, she was not only a petite, disabled woman (she only stood 5'3\" and weighed 87 pounds when she died), she was also a talented, beautiful, and beloved actress who had appeared in Stand and Deliver and on ER. And it was not as if the media had not treated victims of police shootings with sympathy before. When Michael Brown was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, the media turned his case into a cause célèbre. I was in for a rude awakening. While there were media outlets that questioned what happened in South Pasadena on that day and treated Vanessa with sympathy, there were many others that simply accepted South Pasadena's false narrative as fact and as a result treated Vanessa unsympathetically. I have to think that the reason so much of the media coverage of Vanessa's death painted her in a negative light was simply poor journalism. Various media outlets simply did not go to the trouble to research Vanessa's life, interview Vanessa's friends, or anything else beyond listening to the City of South Pasadena. Indeed, I find it notable that those media outlets who bothered to do their research painted much more sympathetic and realistic portraits of Vanessa.  I also have to say that the students who write for the South Pasadena High School newspaper The Tiger have done a much better job of covering Vanessa's death than many professional journalists.I think another reason so much of the media coverage of Vanessa Marquez's death was not particularly sympathetic may have been racism, if only on a subconscious level. Vanessa was a Chicana, a Mexican American. Sadly, even though  Chicanos are shot and killed by police disproportionately, their deaths often go uncovered by the media. When their deaths are covered by the media, they are often not given the same sympathy as other ethnicities. Part of me cannot help but think that had Vanessa been white or Black, her death might have been treated with much more sympathy by the press.Another reason I think so much of the coverage of Vanessa's death was not particularly sympathetic may have been misogyny, again, if only on a subconscious level. Even today women are considered to be more emotional and less rational than men. If a woman is intelligent and outspoken, and dares to stand up for herself, she is sometimes labelled as \"crazy.\" Because of systemic misogyny, some reporters may have found the idea that Vanessa was suicidal and pointed a BB gun at police officers more realistic than incompetent, unprofessional (but male) police officers mistaking her phone or some other object for a gun.I think it is also possible that the fact Vanessa had dared speak out against sexual harassment on ER and accused George Clooney of helping blacklist her may have affected some reporters' view of her. Even in the era of #MeToo, there is often a tendency not to believe women, particularly women of colour, when they make accusations of sexual harassment. At the same time, while his career is not what it once was, George Clooney is still a popular actor and perceived to be loved by audiences whether he actually is or not. There may have been some reporters who may have been offended when Vanessa accused Clooney of blacklisting her, and as a result this influenced their view of Vanessa. As I pointed out above, some media outlets included Vanessa's accusation that Clooney helped blacklist her in their stories as if it was yet more \"proof\" that she was \"mentally disturbed.\"I also think the media may have underestimated just how popular Vanessa Marquez really was. One of the things I have learned following Vanessa's murder is that she had more fans than even I thought she had.   A reporter told me not long after he death that Vanessa was royalty in the Chicano community of Southern California. As I pointed out above the petition to include her in the Oscars' on-air In Memoriam reel exceeded 12,000 signatures. Since Vanessa's death I have been contacted by fans on occasion who just want to let me know how much they admired her. On her YouTube channel there are many, many comments in which people express their admiration for Vanessa. I think the media failed to realize just how beloved Vanessa was, just as they failed to realize that the majority of people rejected the false narrative created by South Pasadena. From my experience, most people do not believe for a moment that Vanessa committed \"suicide by cop.\"  Of course, I don't think it mattered to tabloid media outlets such as The Daily Mail and Inside Edition how popular Vanessa was.  I think somehow they were convinced that portraying Vanessa as a \"mentally disturbed\" woman who decided to commit \"suicide by cop\" was a better story than portraying Vanessa as a disabled women in the middle of a medical crisis who was murdered by incompetent, unprofessional police officers. Of course, it must also be noted that The Daily Mail has always been conservative in politics and as a result their coverage would favour the police. I was actually shocked when they published a sympathetic story about Vanessa after the wrongful death complaint was filed on behalf of Vanessa's mother. I guess it is possible my email to them did some good. Sadly, I think the unsympathetic portrayal of Vanessa Marquez by some media outlets would have a deleterious effect. Despite the fact that Vanessa was a beloved actress, not to mention a petite, disabled woman, I think part of the reason that one did not see protests over Vanessa's death on the scale of those on behalf of George Floyd or Breonna Taylor is that so many news outlets insisted on portraying Vanessa as having committed suicide by cop. If many more media outlets had reported Vanessa's murder accurately and had portrayed Vanessa sympathetically, I have to think that protests on her behalf would have occurred earlier and there would have been many more of them. In the end, Vanessa may have received justice by now. Instead, her murderers are still walking around free.The unsympathetic portrayal of Vanessa by some media outlets would even have a deleterious effect on those of us who love Vanessa on a personal level. Aside from Latin Heat, I believe I was the first to tweet about Vanessa's death on Twitter. It was a tweet simply expressing my love for her, my grief at her death, and that she was one of the sweetest people I know. Many of my fellow TCM fans expressed their condolences to me, as did others on Twitter. Unfortunately, I also received a number of hateful, insulting tweets from right-wing trolls simply because I had dared express my grief at the death of the one person who mattered most to me. Keep in mind that at this point I had not slept at all and I had been crying nonstop for literally hours.  I have to think if many media outlets had not portrayed Vanessa's death as \"suicide by cop,\" then perhaps I would not have received those tweets, or at least not as many. As it is, the often unsympathetic and inaccurate articles about Vanessa following her death hurt and I believe that they actually compounded my grief. It reached the point that I simply avoided any stories regarding Vanessa unless they were vetted by friends.  No one wants to see someone they love portrayed in a negative light that bears absolutely no resemblance to reality. The Daily Mail and Inside Edition are not the only media outlets I have emailed regarding Vanessa's death by a long shot.Now I realize there may be those who will claim that I am so consumed by my grief and so angry over Vanessa's murder that I am seeing the media coverage in an overly negative light. And, to be honest. I cannot deny that there might not be some credence to this. That having been said, many of my friends  and many of Vanessa's friends have also noticed that some media outlets tended to portray Vanessa unsympathetically and never considered that South Pasadena's account of her death might not be true. Fortunately, it appears that since the settlement against South Pasadena on behalf of Vanessa's mother, coverage of Vanessa Marquez has become more positive. I am hoping that this trend continues. Of course, I am also hoping that eventually Vanessa will receive justice and her murderers will be in prison where they belong. Until that time, I am going to continue fighting for Vanessa. I will continue writing various government agencies and other entities in an effort to get her justice. And any time I see a media outlet portray Vanessa or her murder inaccurately, they are going to hear from me. Vanessa meant the world to me. I can do nothing less."},

{"title": "The Late Great Charlie Watts", "date": "Thursday, August 26, 2021", "text": "Charlie Watts, the sharp-dressed drummer of The Rolling Stones, died on August 24 2021 at the age of 80.Charlie Watts was born on June 2 1941 in Bloomsbury, London. He spent his early years in Wembley. As a boy, Charlie Watts developed an interest in jazz. Among the first records he owned as a boy were ones by Jelly Roll Morton, Charlie Parker, Johnny Dodd, Duke Ellington, and Thelonious Monk. His family eventually moved to Kingsbury. It was when he was thirteen that he became interested in drumming. He received his first drum kit in 1955 from his parents He practised by playing along to the various jazz records he owned. He later enrolled in Harrow Art School. He worked for a time as a graphic designer for the advertising firm Charlie Daniels, and played drums in a Middlesex band called Jo Jones All Stars.It was in 1961 that Alex Korner invited Charlie Watts to join Blues Incorporated. He played with Blues Incorporated while continuing to work in advertising for the firm of Charles, Hobson, and Gray. It was in 1962 that Mr. Watts met Brian Jones, Ian Stewart, and Keith Richards, who had recently formed a band then called \"The Rollin' Stones.\" It was in January 1963 that he first played with The Stones and in February 1963 that he became The Rolling Stones' permanent drummer. In addition to being The Rolling Stones' drummer, as a graphic artist Charlie Watts would also add artwork to the band's early album sleeves. Ultimately, Charlie Watts drummed on all forty of The Rolling Stones' albums.Charlie Watts also worked outside of The Rolling Stones. It was in the late Seventies that he formed the boogie woogie band Rocket 88 with Ian Stewart, Alex Korner, and Dick Morrissey. In the Eighties he formed his own big band, The Charlie Watts Orchestra. In 1991 he formed The Charlie Watts Quintet. In 2009 he began performing with the ABC&D of Boogie Woogie. He also owned an Arabian stud farm in Devon. While he never received a driver's licence, he also collected cars.Both on stage and off stage, Charlie Watts offered a sharp contrast to his band mates in The Rolling Stones. Impeccably dressed in his Saville Row suits and quiet, he avoided much of the drug abuse and infighting that sometimes occurred in the band. He was married to his wife Shirley for 57 years and never strayed from her. On stage he avoided the flamboyance of his band mates as well, his the power of his drum beats, his keeping time, and his sheer speed as impeccable as his suits. Although sometimes he was not counted among the greatest drummers of all time, he truly was one of them. He was easily the match of Keith Moon, Ginger Baker, and John Bonham. By his own admission he did not like drum solos, but in truth Charlie Watts never needed them. His talent was obvious on such songs as \"Paint It, Black,\" \"Gimme Shelter,\" \"Brown Sugar,' and many, many others. What is more, Charlie Watts wasn't just a great drummer, he was a very versatile one. He was as at home playing The Rolling Stones' songs as he was jazz standards. He was so important to The Rolling Stones that Keith Richards called him, \"the Key.\" What made Charlie Watts even more charming was that he refused to take being part of one of the most legendary rock bands seriously. He did not particularly care to talk about his place in the history of rock music, and he was often self-effacing when he did. In the end, it can be said that Charlie Watts was a class act all the way."},
{"title": "The Late Great Don Everly", "date": "Tuesday, August 24, 2021", "text": "Legendary musician and singer Don Everly of The Everly Brothers died on August 21 2021 at the age of 84.Don Everly was born on February 1 1937 in  Brownie, Kentucky. His brother Phil Everly would be born nearly two years later in Chicago. Their parents, Ike and Margaret Everly, were country musicians who moved to Kentucky to Chicago in order to pursue opportunities in the music industry there. It was not long after Phil's birth that they moved to Iowa. Ike would have his own radio show on radio stations  KMA and KFNF in Shenandoah, Iowa, on which both his wife and sons also sang. Don and Phil Everly made their singing debut on Ike Everly's show in 1945. When Don and Phil Everly were teenagers, they left for Nashville to pursue their own careers in music. The two of them were hired as songwriters for Roy Acuff's publishing company. The first hit Don Everly ever wrote would then be \"Thou Shalt Not Steal\", sung by Kitty Wells. \"Thou Shalt Not Steal\" went to number 14 on the Billboard country music chart in 1954.In 1956 The Everly Brothers recorded their first single, the country song \"Keep A-Lovin' Me\" on the Columbia label. It was in 1957 that they signed with the Cadence label. Their second single, \"Bye Bye Love,\" released in March 1957, turned out to be their first hit. It went to went to #2 on the Billboard singles chart and #1 on the Billboard country music chart. Their third single would prove to be an even bigger hit. Released in September 1957, \"Wake Up Little Susie\" went to no. 1 on the Billboard singles chart and no. 1 on the Billboard country chart.In the following years The Everly Brothers would have several hits. \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\" and \"Cathy's Clown\" both went to no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Bird Dog\", \"Devoted to You\", \"Problems\", \"(Till) I Kissed You\", \"Let It Be Me\", \"When Will I Be Loved\", \"So Sad\", \"Walk Right Back\", \"Ebony Eyes\" \"Crying in the Rain\", and \"That's Old Fashioned\" all hit the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. The Everly Brothers may have been ever bigger in the United Kingdom, where they had no less than six no. 1 singles.In 1960 The Everly Brothers left Cadence for the Warner Brothers label. In November 1961 The Everly Brothers both enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. They would be largely out of the public eye for six months. Their appearance on February 18 1962 edition of The Ed Sullivan Show was one of their few appearances during this era. Perhaps as a result, their career would stall in the United States in 1962. Their last top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 would be \"That Old Fashioned\" early that year. The would have only two more top forty hits in the United States (in 1964 Gone, Gone, Gone\", which went to no. 31, while in 1967 \"Bowling Green\" went to no. 40). Despite their career having stalled in the United States, The Everly Brothers continued to have several more hits in the United Kingdom.Despite no longer doing well on the charts, The Everly Brothers continued to be a creative force in music. They recorded the album Two Yanks in England with The Hollies, and combined The Everly Brothers' earlier style with The Hollies' jangly guitars. The album would be considered crucial in the evolution of power pop. Their 1968 album, Roots, would prove pivotal in the development of country rock.Warner Brothers Records ultimately allowed The Everly Brothers' contract to expire after several years without any hit records in the United States. They signed with RCA Victor in 1971. That same year they also had their own summer television replacement show, The Everly Brothers Show, on ABC. Unfortunately their two albums on RCA Victor would not prove successful. To make matters worse, tensions between Don and Phil Everly had been growing for years. It was at a concert on July 14 1973 that it became obvious that The Everly Brothers would not be recording together any time soon. The two argued between each other on stage until Don finally left with the words, \"I'm through being an Everly Brother!\" Phil finished the concert by himself.Even before the break up, Don Everly had recorded a self-titled solo album in 1970. It would be followed by Sunset Towers in 1974 and Brother Juke-Box in 1976. He recorded \"Everytime You Leave\" with Emmylou Harris for her 1979 album Blue Kentucky Girl.Don and Phil Everly reunited ten years after their break up at the Royal Albert Hall in London on September 23 1983. The concert was recorded for a live album and for cable television broadcasts. The Everly Brothers recorded three more albums together: EB 84 in 1984,   Born Yesterday in 1986, and Some Hearts in 1988. The Everly Brothers recorded no more studio albums, although they continued to tour together.The Everly Brothers would record with other artists. They appeared on Johnny Cash's single \"Ballad of a Teenage Queen.\" They performed the song \"Cold\" for for  a concept album based on Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jim Steinman's musical Whistle Down the Wind. In 2003 and 2004 The Everly Brothers toured with Simon & Garfunkel during the latter duo's Old Friends reunion tour. In 2014 Don Everly performed \"Bye Bye Love\" at the Annual Music Masters as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  on October 24 2014. In 2018 he made his final appearance, performing with Paul Simon in Nashville on Paul Simon's farewell tour.The Everly Brothers are legends for a very good reason. Quite simply, they were extremely influential in the development of rock music. Their vocal harmonies could be a major influence on The Beatles, who utilized Everly-style harmonies on their early songs. They would also have an impact on other British Invasion bands, including The Hollies, Freddie and the Dreamers, Peter and Gordon, Herman's Hemits, and yet others. In the United States they would influence such music acts as The Beach Boys, They Byrds, and Simon & Garfunkel.>Indeed, The Everly Brothers would have an impact on entire subgenres of rock music. Arguably, the genre of power pop would not exist without them, as it is the blend of close harmonies and guitars that define the genre. Folk rock also owes a debt to The Everly Brothers, with two of the biggest folk acts (The Byrds and Simon & Garfunkel) showing the influence of The Everly Brothers. Even their album Roots would have an impact on country rock.Along with his brother Phil, Don Everly changed rock music forever. The Everly Brothers influenced major artists to come and even led to the development of entirely new subgenres of rock music. It is quite possible that without The Everly Brothers we would not have The Beatles, The Hollies, Simon & Garfunkel, or The Byrds, at least not as we known them. Indeed, to this day The Everly Brothers still hold record for the most hit singles of any duo to reach the Billboard Hot 100. Few music acts have ever been as influential as The Everly Brothers."},
{"title": "Godspeed Sonny Chiba", "date": "Saturday, August 21, 2021", "text": "Sonny Chiba, the actor and martial artist who starred in such films as The Street Fighter (1974), Goglo 13: Assignment Kowloon (1977), and Samurai Reincarnation (1981),  died on August 19 2021 at the age of 82. The cause was complications from COVID-19.Sonny Chiba was born January 22 1939 in Fukoka,  Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. His father was a pilot in the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service. In high school Sonny Chiba participated in artistic gymnastics, track and field, baseball, and volleyball. He was also an avid movie buff, and watched such Westerns as Shane (1953) and High Noon (1954).  In 1957 he began attending the Nippon Sport Science University. Until his career was derailed by a back injury, Sonny Chiba was a serious contender for the Japanese Olympics team. While still attending university, Mr. Chiba began studying martial arts with  Kyokushin Karate master Masutatsu \"Mas\" Oyama.Sonny Chiba was discovered in a talent search conducted by Toei Company. Toei gave him the stage name Chiba Shin'ichi. He began his career in 1959 in the tokusatu TV series Nana-iro kamen. In 1960 he appeared in the TV series Arâ no shisha. In the Sixties he appeared on such Japanese TV shows as JNR Inspector No. 36 and Jûdô itchokusen. He made his film debut in 1961 in Keishichô monogatari: Fuzai shômei. In the Sixties he appeared in a variety of movies, from action films to science fiction. They included such films as Fūraibō tantei: akai tani no sangek (1961 Drifting Detective: Tragedy in the Red Valley), Uchû Kaisokusen (1961 Invasion of the Neptune Men),  Kamikaze yarō: Mahiru no kettō (1966 Kamikaze Man: Duel at Noon), Ōgon Batto (1966), Soshiki bôryoku  (1967), and Yakuza deka (1970).In the Seventies, The Street Fighter (1974) brought Sonny Chiba an international audience. In the United States, the film was rated X by the MPAA Ratings Board for its extreme violence. In the U.S. he was billed as \"Sonny Chiba,\" which would be the name he would use for most non-Japanese projects from that time forward. The Street Fighter proved successful enough to be followed by two sequels, Return of the Street Fighter (1974) and The Street Fighter's Last Revenge (1974), as well as spin-off projects such as Sister Street Fighter (1974). In addition to the Street Fighter films, Sonny Chiba also appeared in such movies as Karate Kiba (1973), The Executioner (1974), The Bullet Train (1975), Champion of Death (1975), Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon (1977), Shogun's Samurai (1978), Message from Space (1978), and Shogun's Ninja (1980).  He starred on the TV series The Bodyguard, The Gorilla Seven, The Yagyu Conspiracy, and Shadow Warriors, and appeared on such shows as Robot Detective and Crossroads. the Eighties Sonny Chiba starred in the cult film Samurai Reincarnation (1981), as well as such movies as Fall Guy (1982), Ninja Wars (1982), Legend of the Eight Samurai (1983), and Shogun's Shadow (1989). He starred on the television shows Shadow Warriors II, Shadow Warriors III,  Shadow Warriors IV, and Shadow Warriors: The End of an Era.In the Nineties Sonny Chiba appeared in such films as Aces: Iron Eagle III (1992), The Triple Cross (1992), Immortal Combat (1994), The Storm Riders (1998), and Born to Be King (2000). On television he starred in the shows Tokugawa Buraichō and  Terakoya Yume Shinan. In the Naughts he played Hattori Hanzō in Kill Bill Volume I (2003) and Kill Bill Volume II (2004). He also appeared in such  movies as Deadly Outlaw: Rekka (2002), Battle Royale II: Requiem (2003), Explosive City (2004), The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), and Master of Thunder (2006). He starred on the TV shows Fūrin Kazan. In the Teens he appeared in such movies as Sushi Girl (2012), Take a Chance (2015), and April Fools (2015). His final film is Bond of Justice: Kizuna, currently in post-production.Sonny Chiba is one of the most famous martial arts stars of all time, and there can be no doubt why. The style of fighting portrayed in his movies was a sharp contrast to previous martial arts on film, much more brutal. What further established Sonny Chiba as a star was that he also happened to be a very good actor. While in the United States he may be best known for such crime films as The Street Fighter, he acted in genres ranging from science fiction to  jidaigeki. Indeed, he portrayed Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi multiple times, as well as such other historical figures as  Miyamoto Musashi and even his mentor Mas Oyama. Regardless of genre, he always gave a good performance.While Sonny Chiba played bad guys often and even his heroes could be merciless, in reality he was as far removed from his screen persona as one could get.  His agent, Timothy Beal, said of Mr. Chiba, \"He was a great friend and an awesome client. Such a humble, caring and friendly man. I will surely miss him.\" Sonny Chiba was a true legend who changed cinema forever. His influence is still being felt to this day."},

He appeared on such TV shows as Night Gallery, Gunsmoke, Mission: Impossible, Insight, The F.B.I., Police Story, Police Woman, The Six Million Dollar Man, and The Love Boat. He appeared in such movies as Chosen Survivors (1974), Inn of the Damned (1977), and Grayeagle (1977). In the Eighties Mr. Cord starred on the short lived show Cassie & Co. and Airwolf.

He appeared in such movies as Roots of Evil (1992), CIA Code Name: Alexa (1992), and The Naked Truth (19920. His last appearance on screen was in 2009 in the movie Fire from Below.Alex Cord was a particularly talented actor who played a variety of roles. He was the Ringo Kid in the 1966 remake of Stagecoach, Dylan Hunt in Gene Roddenberry's failed pilot Genesis II, and Archangel on Airwolf. He could play heroes as easily as he could play villains, and was as comfortable in Westerns as he was science fiction or action movies."},

The simple fact is that they have not been easy. Last Thursday, August 11 2021, my brother had a massive heart attack. They put in a stent and he spent a few days in hospital. He is doing fine, although he will have to have another stent put in next Tuesday. As if that wasn't enough, my cat Malcolm has been sick. We got him some hairball medication and he seems better today. I have been worried about him. I also had two friends die recently, both from cancer. One was 82, the other was in her thirties. Suffice it to say, it has not been a particularly easy time since last Thursday.August has never been a good month for me. It was the month that my best friend from college, Ron, died. It is also the month during which my dearest Vanessa Marquez died. It is a month I usually dread. Regardless, I do hope to get back to making posts regularly later in the week."},

In 1939 the family moved to Los Angeles so her father could work in Hollywood. She was still a child when she decided that she wanted to act. She made her Broadway debut in 1942 in Solitaire. In 1944 she played the title role in Violet on Broadway. She graduated from Marymount High School in 1947. In 1949 she attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She also appeared in plays on the West End and made her television debut in the TV movie The Case of Thomas Pyke on the BBC. She made her film debut in her father's movie Stage Fright in 1950. She also appeared in the movie The Mudlark (1950).In the Fifties Miss Hitchcock appeared in her father's film Strangers on a Train (1951) as Barbara Morton, the younger sister of Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). She appeared in a bit part in The Ten Commandments (1956) and a role in her father's classic Psycho (1960). In the Fifties she made several appearances on Alfred Hitchcock Presents as well as her father's other series Suspicion. She also guest starred on the show Suspense, My Little Margie, Front Row Center, Screen Directors Playhouse, Matinee Theatre, The Life of Riley, and Playhouse 90. She appeared on Broadway in The High Ground in 1951.Pat Hitchcock retired from acting to raise her children, but she appeared in the TV movies  feature film Skateboard (1978)  and in the TV movies Ladies of the Corridor and Six Characters in Search of an Author.Following her retirement from acting, Pat Hitchcock continued to contribute to Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine. She served as an executive producer on the documentary The Man on Lincoln's Nose (2000), which centred on art director Robert F. Boyle. She co-wrote a biography on her mother, Alma Hitchcock: The Woman Behind the Man, with Laurent Bouzereau.I have always thought Pat Hitchcock was underrated as an actress. She only appeared in Stage Fright briefly, but she was memorable as an enthusiastic acting student. In Strangers on a Train Miss Hitchcock stole every scene she was in as the slightly morbid, plain spoken Barbara Morton. Beyond her appearances in films, there was also her many appearances on television. She shined in her many appearances on Alfred Hitchcock Presents, whether as a daughter seeking her missing mother in \"Into Thin Air\" or a rural schoolteacher in The Belfry. I always wished Pat Hitchcock had appeared in more movies and TV shows.Of course, Pat Hitchcock also did a wonderful job of keeping her parents' legacies alive. She regularly appeared in documentaries about her parents and gave many interviews about them over the years. And while a good deal of attention was always paid to her father, Alfred Hitchcock, Pat Hitchcock made sure her mother Alma always got attention too. As both an actress  and a living tie to film history, she was wonderful."},

She attended Pomona College and later Lewis & Clark College in Oregon, from which she graduated. She began her career working behind the scenes on game shows. She wrote questions for Family Feud, selected prizes for The Price is Right, and worked as an associate producer on Double Dare. She first appeared in front of the camera as one of the card dealers on Card Sharks.Markie Post made her debut in narrative television in 1979 in an episode of CHiPs. In the late Seventies she guest starred on the shows Barnaby Jones, The Incredible Hulk, The Lazarus Syndrome, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Hart to Hart, B.J. and the Bear, House Calls, and Eight is Enough. In 1980 she appeared in her first regular role on a show, the short-lived sitcom Semi-Tough.It was in 1982 that she began played the role of bail bondsman Terri Michaels on The Fall Guy. She remained with the show until 1985, when she joined the cast of the classic comedy Night Court as public defender Christine Sullivan. She remained with Night Court for the rest of its run. During the Eighties she guest starred on the shows The Greatest American Hero, Simon & Simon, McLain's Law, Code Red, Matt Houston, The Love Boat, Cheers, Fantasy Island, Glitter, Scene of the Crime, The A-Team, and Hotel. She appeared in the mini-series The Gangster Chronicles. Miss Post also appeared in the movie Gangster Wars.Markie Post continued to appear on Night Court into the early Nineties.

He appeared in the movies Muffin Top: A Love Story (2017) and Sweet Sweet Summertime (2017).I have to confess that I always had a bit of a crush on Markie Post, and it went beyond the fact that she was beautiful. She simply shined in every role she played. I have no doubt that she will always be remembered best as Christine Sullivan on Night Court. In many ways the part seemed perfect for Miss Post. Christine was honest and warm hearted, and could even be naive at times. That having been said, Markie Post played many other roles. Georgie on Hearts Afire differed a good deal from Christine. She was sassy and could be bold at times. While Christine ended to be a bit of conformist, Georgie was a bit of a rebel. Some of her roles were even further removed from Christine. In the TV movie Tricks of the Trade she played a prostitute. Markie Post was good in nearly every role she ever played."},

She was only four years old when she was already singing and dancing and doing celebrity impersonations. She was cast on the Saturday morning children's radio program Aunt Sally's Kiddie Revue on WGST in Atlanta. Eventually she had her own radio show, Dixie's Dainty Dewdrop.It was when Jane Withers was six years old that her family moved to Hollywood. She modelled for department stores and played bit parts in such movies as Handle with Care (1932) and Tailspin Tommy (1934). It was in 1934 that she was cast in a supporting role in Bright Eyes. She received her first lead role with Ginger in 1935.  Her career flourished in the 1930s, as she appeared in the movies The Farmer Takes a Wife (1935), This is the Life (1935), Paddy O'Day (1935), Gentle Julia (1936), Little Miss Nobody (1936), Pepper (1936), Can This Be Dixie?

Jane Withers would become the only child star to finish a seven year contract. It was a mark of her success that Jane Withers was heavily merchandised. There were Jane Withers dresses, jewellery, paper doll books, handbags, and more.In the Forties Jane Withers appeared in the movies Golden Hoofs (1941), Her First Beau (1941), A Very Young Lady (1941), Young America (1942), The Mad Martindales (1942), Small Town Debs (1942), Johnny Doughboy (1942), The North Star (1943), My Best Gal (1944), Faces in the Fog (1944), Affairs of Geraldine (1946), and Danger Street (1947).  She retired not long after completing Danger Street and before her marriage.In 1954 Jane Withers got a divorce and she returned to acting in Giant (1956). She also appeared in the movie The Heart is a Rebel (1958).

In he Eighties she appeared on television in the TV show Hart to Hart. In the Nineties she appeared on the TV shows Murder, She Wrote and Amazing Grace, and provided additional voices for Mickey Mouse Works. She provided a voice for the Disney animated movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). On television in the Naughts she provided voices for the TV show House of Mouse.Jane Withers attended the TCM Classic Film Festival multiple times. She also granted several interviews over the years.Jane Withers was a remarkable actress, both as a child and as an adult. As a child she generally played mischievous little girls or tomboys, in sharp contrast to fellow child star Shirley Temple's sugary sweet characters. Even as a teenager she often played the smart-alecky  kid who was prone to get into trouble. As an adult she was the consummate character actress. In Giant she played Vashti Hake Snythe, the Benedicts' flamboyant neighbour who enjoyed spending the fortune she had earned from oil. In the Alfred Hitchcock Hour episode \"How to Get Rid of Your Wife,\" Miss Withers played a wife so verbally abusive that her husband plots to get rid of her. In The Munsters episode \"Pike's Pique\" she played Fanny Pike, the somewhat paranoid wife of city official Borden T. Pike. Of course, she spent years playing Josephine the Plumber. Josephine was a lot like Miss Withers in real life; helpful and friendly. Jane Witheers took the role very seriously, even taking a course in plumbing.While Jane Withers often played a brat on screen, in real life she was one of the nicest people one could meet. Starting in childhood, she had an extensive doll collection. When fans started sending the child star dolls, her parents required her to give one doll away to a needy child for every two she received. The generosity her parents taught her remained with her for the rest of her life. At the height of her career as a child star she was known to visit hospitals and orphanages. During World War II she not only took part in war bond drives, but toured military camps in the United States. Miss Withers was involved in dozens of charities. Having attended the TCM Classic Film Festival, I know several people who met Jane Withers in person. All of them have the same thing to say about her. She was one of the kindest, sweetest people one could ever meet, and gifted with a wonderful sense of humour. The height of Jane Withers's stardom may have been in the Thirties, but for many she remained a star for the entirety of her life."},
{"title": "Former NBC Executive Herbert Schlosser Passes On", "date": "Saturday, August 7, 2021", "text": "Herbert Schlosser, a long time NBC executive who helped bring Johnny Carson to the network to host The Tonight Show and was pivotal in the development of Saturday Night Live, died yesterday, August 6 2021, at the age of 95.Herbert Schlosser was born in Atlantic City on April 21 1926. He served in the United States Navy and afterwards studied public and international affairs at Princeton University. Two years following his graduation from Princeton in 1949, he graduated from Yale Law School. He began his career as a lawyer with a Wall Street law firm. Bored by that job, he took a job at Phillips Nizer Benjamin Krim & Ballon. Phillips Nizer Benjamin Krim & Ballon had many clients in the entertainment industry, including Charlie Chaplin, Salvador Dali, Eddie Fisher, Alan Jay Lerner, and Mae West, among others. His experience at Phillips Nizer Benjamin Krim & Ballon resulted him being hired by general counsel of California National Productions, a production subsidiary of NBC Films (itself the syndication arm of the television network NBC). He later became California National Productions' chief operating officer.It was in 1960 that Herbert Schlosser moved to the business affairs department of NBC. It was in that position that he headed the negotiations to bring Johnny Carson from ABC over to NBC to replace Jack Paar as the host of The Tonight Show. In 1966 Mr. Schlosser was named NBC's vice president of west coast programming. In this position he was responsible for bringing more black performers to the network, including Diahann Carroll in the sitcom Julia, Flip Wilson and his variety show The Flip Wilson Show, and Redd Foxx in the sitcom Sanford and Son. He also supported Rowan & Marin's Laugh-In, often protecting the show from NBC's Broadcast Standards department and others at the network who found some of its content offensive.In 1972 he was promoted to executive vice president at the television network. It was a year later that he became its president. In 1974 he became president of the National Broadcasting Company, the parent company of the NBC television network. In 1977 he became its chief executive. It was in 1975, when Johnny Carson said that he wanted the weekend reruns of The Tonight Show pulled, that Mr. Schlosser wrote a memo that outlined the basic idea behind Saturday Night Live (it would be televised live from 30 Rockefeller Plaza, it would be aired live, and it had to appeal to the young). Failing to produce a prime-time hit for NBC, Herbert Schlosser was forced out in 1978. He was then named as executive vice president of RCA, the parent company of the National Broadcasting Company. There he worked on RCA's SelectaVision videodisc project. In 1981 he was selected to head all of RCA's entertainment properties, save for NBC. In 1985 he became a senior advisor at Wertheim & Company, and the chairman of the proposed Museum of the Moving Image. Herbert Schlosser proved very influential in the history of American television. He was pivotal in bringing Johnny Carson to NBC for The Tonight Show. He supported the television careers of Diahann Carroll, Flip Wilson, and Redd Foxx. He championed Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In and was pivotal in bringing Saturday Night Live to the air. In the history of NBC, there were only a few others who had a greater impact."},
{"title": "The Lasting Impact of Lucille Ball", "date": "Friday, August 6, 2021", "text": "It was 110 years ago today that Lucille Ball was born. Her impact on American entertainment and pop culture is well known. With her husband Desi Arnaz, she founded Desilu Productions. This made her both one of the first women to own a studio and one of the earliest female producers. Her sitcom I Love Lucy would not only be one of American television's first hits, but it would have a lasting influence. In starring Lucy with her real life husband Desi Arnaz, it portrayed one of the first ethnically mixed marriages on television. When Miss Ball became pregnant with her son Desi Arnaz Jr., it became one of the first shows to portray a pregnancy on American television. And while I Love Lucy was not the first sitcom to filmed using a multi-camera format in front of a live audience, in doing so it would have a lasting impact on sitcoms to come. Of course, Desilu Productions would produce other influential shows besides I Love Lucy. They include Our Miss Brooks, The Untouchables, Star Trek, and Mission: Impossible.Lucille Ball would also have a lasting impact on generations of actors and comedians. During her lifetime she would nurture the careers of performers who would become legends in their own right. Barbara Eden guest starred on the I Love Lucy episode \"Country Club Dance\" as the guest of one of Lucy's neighbours who sets all the men's hearts aflutter. Desi Arnaz was well-known for his womanizing, and he was taken with Barbara Eden. He would show up at any rehearsal she was at and he made no secret of his desire for her. This made things difficult for Miss Eden, who had enormous respect for Lucy. She took to avoiding Desi Arnaz whenever possible.A lesser woman might have been jealous of Barbara Eden and might have treated her poorly, but Lucille Ball recognized Miss Eden's talent and treated her kindly. Lucy invited her to her dressing room and let her pick out a dress, which she then made sure would make Barbara Eden look even more glamorous. According to Miss Eden's autobiography, Jeanie Out of the Bottle, Lucille Ball also gave her encouragement. She told her, \"You're good, Barbara. You don’t usually find a pretty girl who can project and be funny at the same time. But make sure to put that pretty little face of yours out there. Let the camera love your face.\" Lucy even offered Barbara Eden a contract with Desilu. While Miss Eden turned her down, the two remained friends.Lucille Ball also nurtured the career of Carol Burnett. The two had met backstage when Miss Burnett was performing on Broadway in Once Upon a Mattress. The two talked for a half hour and when Lucy left, she told Carol Burnett, \"Kid, if you ever need me for anything, give me a call.\" Lucille Ball would be Carol Burnett's guest on her first special, Carol +2. She made frequent guest appearances on The Carol Burnett Show and Carol Burnett guest starred on both The Lucy Show and Here's Lucy. Carol Burnett would often ask Lucille Ball for advice. Lucy even sent Carol Burnett a bouquet of flowers every year on her birthday. Sadly, Lucy would die on Carol Burnett's birthday (Carol was born April 23 1933 and Lucy died on April 23 1989, but flowers from Lucy to Carol Burnett still arrived.Lucille Ball was also a mentor to Robert Osborne, the legendary film historian and host of Turner Classic Movies. She signed him to Desilu and he studied acting under Miss Ball as part of the Desilu Workshop. Robert met with some success as an actor, guest starring on Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, Whirlybirds, and Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond and making small appearances on various movies. He appeared in the pilot for The Beverly Hillbillies and there was even talk of him having a recurring role on the show. He turned it down as he didn't think The Beverly Hillbillies  would last.While Robert Osborne had some success as an actor, it was Lucille Ball who saw that his talents actually lay elsewhere. She suggested to Robert that he pursue a career in writing. His first book, His first book, Academy Awards Illustrated, was published in 1965. Those of us who enjoyed watching Robert Osborne as host of TCM then owe a debt of gratitude to Lucille Ball. Without Miss Ball, Robert Osborne might have never become an author and film historian, and as a result he might not have been selected to host Turner Classic Movies.Lucy would also be responsible for saving two shows that have since become legendary. Both Star Trek and Mission: Impossible were produced by Desilu. While it is uncertain if Lucille Ball had any responsibility in getting both shows on the air, it is known that she saved both shows from her Desilu executives. Argyle Nelson, head of production and studio operations, and Edwin Holly, senior vice president, estimated that both Star Trek and Mission: Impossible would cost $225,000 apiece a week to produce, with weekly revenues of $160,000 apiece. This meant Desilu would lose a good deal of money on both shows. Ed Holly was so opposed to Star Trek and Mission: Impossible that he told Lucy that they would have to sell the studio if they produced the pilots for both shows.There are two stories as to how Lucy decided to go forward with both shows. Herb Solow, executive in charge of production at Desilu, supported Star Trek and Mission: Impossible. He then persuaded Lucille Ball to go forward with the two shows by invoking Desilu's past of producing quality television. Lucy's daughter, Lucie Arnaz, told a simpler version at William Shatner's induction into the Television Academy Hall of Fame. When Lucy's executives at Desilu told her that Star Trek and Mission: Impossible were too expensive to produce, she simply replied, \"No, I like 'em!\" Lucy usually listened to her executives at Desilu, but in the case of Star Trek and Mission: Impossible, she remained determined that the studio would produce both shows. Of course, since then, Star Trek and Mission: Impossible have become the most famous shows produced by Desilu except for I Love Lucy.Lucille Ball was so generous to her fellow performers and the shows produced at Desilu that these are hardly the only stories of how she would have a lasting impact on American entertainment and pop culture. Her influence was very reaching. What is more, it is still being felt to this day."},
{"title": "Vanessa Marquez 3rd Angelversary", "date": "Wednesday, August 4, 2021", "text": "On August 30 2018 my dearest friend Vanessa Marquez was having severe seizures. She was not having a \"mental health crisis.\" She was not suicidal. She simply needed medical aid. It is for that reason that when I texted her, she asked me to call for paramedics in South Pasadena, California. Unfortunately, police officers were also dispatched to her apartment that day. Two of those police officers shot Vanessa in the back and killed her. I am so convinced that these officers acted inappropriately, unprofessionally, and incompetently, and with depraved indifference to Vanessa's well-being, that I wrote a whole blog post about it (\"Justice for Vanessa Marquez\"), not to mention the fact that I have written letters to everyone from the South Pasadena City Council to Los Angeles District Attorney Geroge Gascón (fortunately, Jackie Lacey was voted out last year) in an effort to get Vanessa justice. Sadly, while the City of South Pasadena reached a settlement with Vanessa's mother, the two officers who killed Vanessa have yet to be brought to justice.On August 22 2021 an event in honour of Vanessa's 3rd Angelversary will be held in South Pasadena. I believe it is being organized by Vanessa's friend Minerva Garcia Ortega and Black Lives Matter South Pasadena. The location has yet to determined, but the theme will be the 1940s. Vanessa loved classic movies, as well as vintage clothing and Swing music, so the theme is very appropriate. Sadly, I will not be able to attend, as I do not live in Southern California and I do not have the money to fly there at the moment. That having been said, if you live in Southern California and you can attend, by all means do so. Vanessa meant more to me than anyone I have ever known and I want her to get the justice she has been so long denied. I would like to see as many people speaking out on behalf of Vanessa as possible.  As it is, I will be writing the South Pasadena City Council again, as well as others in authority."},
{"title": "Two Complaints I Have About Google Chrome on Android", "date": "Tuesday, August 3, 2021", "text": "I have never been a fan of Google Chrome. In fact, the default browser on my PC is Firefox, which I regard as a far superior browser. That having been said, on my smartphone I use Chrome. I don't use my phone that much and it simply didn't seem that important to me to install another browser. That having been said, I might just install Firefox on my phone and make it the default browser there as well if Google does not address two complaints I have with Chrome at the moment.My first complaint is with something Google calls \"tab groups.\" In the past, tabs on Chrome on Android were displayed in a vertical layout. With tab groups the tabs are displayed in a grid layout. Supposedly \"tab groups\" are supposed to make it easier to manage and organize tabs, but to me it seems obvious that the exact opposite is the case. Quite simply, tab groups and the grid layout makes it harder to manage tabs. There was a way to disable \"tab groups\" in Chrome on Android under chrome://flags, but sadly it seems to no longer work.It would seem that I am not the only one who detests tab groups and the grid layout. I did a search for \"Chrome android tab groups\" and except for the top result (Google's support page for tabs in Chrome on Android) every single result on the first page is related to disabling and even outright hating \"tab groups.\" Honestly, if Google wants people to continue using Chrome on their phones, they had best restore the means to disable tab groups.The other complaint I have about Chrome on my smart phone is that \"search Google for image..\" has been replaced by \"search with Google Lens.\" If you are wondering what Google Lens is, it's a image recognition technology that Google introduced in 2017.  If you click on \"search with Google Lens,\" it will open up a page identifying who or what is in the photo, the top match in Google and the top few matches in Google Image Search. It only after one clicks on a a link in the bottom that says \"Didn't find what you were looking for? Retry with Google Images.\" Now quite frankly, if I am searching for different sizes of an image, I do not need the top result on Google and I want more than the top four results on Google Image Search. In other words, I want to be able to search with Google Image Search to begin with. Sadly, there was once a way to disable Google Lens in chrome://flags, but it appears to no longer work.Now I have no idea how unpopular taking away \"search Google for image...\" and replacing it with \"search with Google Lens\" is. I do know there are several pages which explain how to disable Google Lens in Chrome on one's phone, something that no longer works. Regardless, I know I do not like it and for those times when I do want to perform a search for an image on Chrome on my phone, I simply scroll to the bottom and try the search in Google Images. It would be much easier if Google simply restored the ability to disable Google Lens in chrome://flags.Anyway, I have sent Google feedback on both tab groups and Google Lens. I am hoping others will do the same. As it is, if Google does not correct this two complains I have with Chrome on my smartphone, Firefox might soon become the default browser on my phone as well as my PC."},
{"title": "The 40th Anniversary of MTV", "date": "Sunday, August 1, 2021", "text": "It was 40 years ago today that MTV launched. Originally the channel was devoted to showing music videos twenty four hours a day. In the Eighties it proved to be a force in pop culture. Many of the videos featured on the channel seeped into the collective consciousness. And while a bit of a music video fad was bubbling under the surface prior to MTV's debut, the channel effectively spurred that fad into overdrive during the early part of the Eighties. MTV brought success to new groups (such as Duran Duran) and renewed success for  older groups (such as ZZ Top). I have already covered the history of MTV elsewhere (see my old posts \"A History of Music Videos Part Five\" and \"A History of Music Videos Part Six\"), so I will keep it brief here. Quite simply, after years of showing nothing but music videos and music-oriented programming, MTV began undergoing channel drift. It was in 1987 that MTV debuted the game show Remote Control, its first non-musical program. It was in 1992 that MTV debuted the reality show The Real World debuted. The success of The Real World would lead to further non-music shows, including Road Rules, Jackass, and Singled Out. By 2000 MTV only showed eight hours worth of music videos a day. By 2008 that number had decreased to only three hours a day. Eventually MTV would cease showing music videos entirely. This has led to jokes about people being old enough to remember when MTV still showed music videos. It ceased being Music Television long ago.While MTV descended into a mess of reality shows and arguably irrelevance, for a time it was a force to be reckoned with. In memory of what MTV once was, here are the first three videos aired on the channel."},
{"title": "Godspeed Dusty Hill of ZZ Top", "date": "Saturday, July 31, 2021", "text": "Dusty Hill, the bassist for ZZ Top, died on July 27 2021 at the age of 72. No cause of death has been given.Dusty Hill was born Joseph Michael Hill on May 19 1949 in Dallas, Texas. As a child he was interested in the blues, buying records by Muddy Waters and Son House. He took up the bass when he was only 13 years old. Dusty Hill, his brother Rocky Hill, and future ZZ Top drummer Frank Beard played in such local Dallas bands as The Warlocks, The Cellar Dwellers, and American Blues. American Blues released three albums. Dusty Hill and Frank Beard eventually left American Blues and relocated to Houston. It was there that Dusty Hill replaced ZZ Top bassist Billy Ethridge and Frank Beard replaced original ZZ Top drummer Dan Mitchell. Of the founding members of ZZ Top, only guitarist Billy Gibbons remained. It was not long after Dusty Hill joined ZZ Top that the band got a recording contract with London Records. Their first album, ZZ Top's First Album, was released in 1971. After two singles that did not chart, ZZ Top broke the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Francine,\" from their second album, Rio Grande Mud. Their next single, \"La Grange,\" from their third album, Tres Hombres, did even better, going to no. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their single \"Tush,\" from the album Fandango!, peaked at no. 20, and would be their highest charting single for years.ZZ Top would reach the peak of their chart success in the Eighties with the album Eliminator in 1983. The album itself went to no. 9 on the Billboard album chart and produced the hit singles \"Sharp Dressed Man\" and \"Legs.\" For the remainder of the Eighties and into the early Nineties, their albums continued to perform well. ZZ Top ultimately released 15 studio albums and four live albums.ZZ Top had possibly one of the most stable line-ups in rock music history, keeping the line up of Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill, and Frank Beard for over 50 years. In 2010 Dusty Hill summed up the band's stability to Classic Rock by simply saying, \"“It’s a cliché and sounds so simplistic, but it’s down to the three of us genuinely enjoying playing together.\" It is certainly hard picturing ZZ Top as consisting of anyone but Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill, and Frank Beard. And there can be no doubt that Dusty Hill was responsible for much of ZZ Top's success.Quite simply, it was Dusty Hill's skill with the bass that provided the bottom line of every ZZ Top song. He was the perfect bassist for ZZ Top's signature style of blues fused with rock music. It is hard picturing anyone but Dusty Hill having played on the boogie blues infused \"La Grange.\""},

This week is usually the hottest part of the year in Missouri, and the past few days were certainly hot. We reached temperatures in the 90s with the humidity typical of the state, so that heat indexes reached well over 100. On top of this my allergies have flared up this week, although I am not sure why. Pollen has been low, so I am guessing it might have to do with the wildfires in California, whose smoke has drifted our way. Anyway, those of you who know me realize how much I hate summer. Right now I am counting down the days to fallTomorrow I hope to get a eulogy for Dusty Hill, the bassist for ZZ Top, out tomorrow. Next week is supposed to be cooler (it is actually going to be below normal, with highs in the lower 80s), so with any luck I will be back on my usual publishing schedule next week!"},

What is more, both are by top experts in their respective fields. If you are like me, then you will be looking forward to reading them.Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir (Revised and Expanded Edition) by Eddie Muller: If you are a fan of film noir, chances are you are familiar with Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir by Eddie Muller. First published in 1998, it has become the bible for film noir. It was on July 21 2021 that Running Press published the new, revised, and expanded edition. Of course, Eddie Muller is one of the foremost experts on film noir in the world, if not the foremost expert. He is the founder and president of the Film Noir Foundation, a non-profit responsible for rescuing and restoring film noirs. He is also a co-programmer of San Francisco's Noir City film festival. Today I suspect many are most familiar with Eddie Muller as the host of  TCM's programming block Noir Alley.Master of Mystery: The Rise of The Shadow by Will Murray: Just as Eddie Muller may well be the expert on film noir, Will Murray may be the expert on pulp magazines, particularly the hero pulps of the Thirties and Forties. In Master of Mystery: The Rise of The Shadow, Will Murray explores the origins of the still popular pulp hero The Shadow. Master of Mystery: The Rise of The Shadow covers The Shadow's start as the host of the radio show The Detective Story Hour to his popular pulp magazine to the character's expansion into his own radio show, movie serials, comic books, and more."},

From August 1 to August 31, each day is devoted to the films of a single star. For many TCM fans, Summer Under the Stars is the programming block to which they look forward the most. I must admit I look forward to it every year, although I must also admit I miss seeing Noir Alley this week!As usual, this year's Summer Under the Stars features days dedicated to top name stars as well as some lesser known ones. For whatever reason this year's Summer Under the Stars schedule didn't denote which stars are being featured on Summer Under the Stars for the first time. That having been said, I think they could be Louis Armstrong, Margaret Rutherford, George Segal, and Setsuko Hara. Of course, there are plenty of big names featured this year, including Bette Davis, Robert Mitchum, Abbott & Costello, Kay Francis, Gregory Peck, Judy Garland, Gloria Grahame, Katharine Hepburn, Eve Arden, Tony Randall, Ingrid Bergman, and James Cagney, among others. With regards to this year's schedule, I probably would have placed some movies in different times and for some stars I would have probably included different movies. That having been said, my only major complaint is with Robert Redford's day on August 18. For the life of me, I don't understand why Out of Africa (1985) is at 7:00 PM and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid  (1969) isn't on until 10:00 PM.  The latter movie is not only far better than the former movie, it is far more popular as well.

Nolan, best known for co-writing the novel Logan's Run with George Clayton Johnson and a wide variety of other works, died on July 15 2021 at the age of 93.William F. Nolan was born on March 6 1928 in Kansas City, Missouri. As a child, he was an avid reader of comic books, pulp magazines, and books, and he loved movies. He attended the Kansas City Art Institute and worked for Hallmark Cards for a time. Not long after World War II, his family moved to Chula Vista, California. It was after he had been in Los Angeles for a time that he discovered the works of Ray Bradbury. He sought Mr. Bradbury out and befriended him. Their friendship eventually led Mr. Nolan to put out his first book, The Ray Bradbury Review. William F. Nolan was an artist for a time before going into writing. He made his first sale of a short story, \"The Darendinger Build-Up,\" to Playboy. It appeared in the June 1956 issue of the magazine. His short stories would be published in a variety of magazines and anthology books.William F. Nolan's first novel was Logan's Run, co-written with this friend George Clayton Johnson. Published in 1967, the novel was loosely adapted as the movie Logan's Run (1977).  It was followed by two sequel novels (Logan's World and Logan's Search), the novella Logan's Return, and two unpublished sequels. He also wrote four hard-boiled detective novels centred on private eye Bart Challis. His Sam Space series combined the science fiction and hard-boiled detective novel. Mr. Nolan also wrote a series centred on paranormal investigator Kincaid. His series of \"Black Mask Boys\" mysteries featured Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Erle Stanley Gardner.William F. Nolan also wrote a number of books on Ray Bradbury, Max Brand, and Dashiell Hammett, as well as biographies on Barney Oldfield, Phil Hill, John Huston, Steve McQueen, and Ernest Hemingway.>br />William F. Nolan also worked in television. He wrote episodes of the shows Wanted Dead or Alive, Norman Corwin Presents, Darkroom, and 240-Robert. He wrote the TV movies The Norliss Tapes, Melvin Purvis G--MAN, The Turn of the Screw, Sky Heist, The Kansas City Massacre, and Bridge Across Time. He also wrote the teleplays for two of the three stories featured in the classic TV movie Trilogy of Terror, based on the works of Richard Matheson. With regards to feature films, he wrote the screenplay for Burnt Offerings (1976).William F. Nolan was certainly a remarkable writer. Logan's Run has certainly made an impact on popular culture. That having been said, he wrote many other works and was nothing if not prolific. His works spanned everything from science fiction to horror to hard-boiled detective fiction to non-fiction. He certainly made lasting contributions to literature."},

When he was a teenager he sang with the Houston based R&B group Archie Bell and The Drells and afterwards a group called Southern Clouds of Joy. Mr. Robinson served in the Army and briefly attended the University of Houston. In the late Sixties, he studied acting at Studio 7, an acting school  ran by Chris Wilson at the Houston Music Theatre.  He later moved to Los Angeles where he joined the Actors Studio.Charlie Robinson made his television debut in an episode of Owen Marshall, Counsellor at Law in 1971. In the Seventies he guest starred on such shows as Firehouse, Carbie, Cannon, The White Shadow, and Lou Grant. He appeared in the mini-series King and Roots: The Next Generation. He appeared in the TV movies Set This Town on Fire, Nowhere to Hide, A Killing Affair, Buffalo Soldiers, and Haywire. He made his film debut in Drive, He Said in 1971. He appeared in the movies Sugar Hill (1974), The Black Gestapo (1975), Gray Lady Down (1978), and Apocalypse Now (1979).It was in 1984, during the second season of Night Court, that Charlie Robinson began played the character of Mac, the easy-going, sensible court clerk. He played Mac for the rest of the show's run. He was also a regular on the shows Flamingo Road and Buffalo Bill. He guest starred on the shows Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere and Hotel. He appeared in the TV movies Rehearsal for Murder, Crash Course, and Murder C.O.D. He appeared in the movie The River (1984).In the Nineties Charlie Robinson was a regular on Love & War, Ink, Home Improvement, and Buddy Faro. He guest starred on the shows CBS Schoolbreak Special, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, The John Laroquette Show, In the House, The Crew, Malcolm & Eddie, and Touched by an Angel. He appeared in the TV movies Project: ALF and The Last Dance. He appeared in the movies Set It Off (1996), Land of the Free (1998), Malevolence (1999), Beowulf (1999), and The Playaz Court (2000).In the Naughts Mr. Robinson had a recurring role on the TV show The Game. He guest starred on the shows Soul Food; First Years; Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place; DAG; The Trouble with Normal; My Wife and Kids; Miss Lettie and Me; Yes, Dear; Abby; Andy Richter Controls the Universe; Carnivàle; The Bernie Mac Show; Committed; Charmed; House M.D.; Cold Case; Still Standing; How I Met Your Mother; The Riches; My Name is Earl; 30 Rock; Big Love; Hank; The Secret Life of the American Teenager; and $#*!

He was just such a very good actor. As Mac on Night Court he was the show's one practical character among a cast of zany ones, the show's calm centre. On Buffalo Bill he was the brutally honest makeup man Newdell, who tried to keep the show's title character in line. In Sugar Hill he played a character about as far as Mac or Newdell as one can get, the gangster Fabulous, whose tastes in clothing leave a bit to be desired. Throughout his career Charlie Robinson played a wide variety of roles, from law enforcement officers to members of the military to judges. What is more, he did all of them well."},
{"title": "Saturday Morning Musical Kid's Shows of the 1960s and 1970s Part Five", "date": "Friday, July 16, 2021", "text": "In 1968 The Banana Splits Adventure Hour and The Archie Show, two kid's shows in which music played a large role, debuted on Saturday morning on the American broadcast networks. The two shows proved to be huge hits and as a result sparked an entire cycle towards musical, Saturday morning, kid's shows. The cycle peaked in the 1970-1971 season, with no less than six such shows debuting. By the 1973-1974 season the cycle was very nearly over. Signs that the cycle had been in decline were apparent as early as the 1971-1972 season, when Archie's TV Funnies became the first Archie project in which music did not play a role. It was also in the 1971-1972 that a musical cartoon debuted (The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show) in which none of the songs were released as singles or on albums. Regardless, two new musical cartoons debuted in the 1973-1974 season.The first of the shows to debut was another Hanna-Barbera cartoon inspired by Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!. Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kids centred on the rock group of that name, who also happened to be government agents. They reported to a self-aware supercomputer named Mr. Socrates. Whereas Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! focused on supernatural mysteries, Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kids focused on various thefts and espionage-style adventures.Two singles from the show, \"Little Miss Magic\" and \"Rosie was a Good Old Girl,\" were released on the Romar label under the name \"The Sun Dance Kids Featuring Butch Cassidy.\" That was the extent of The Sun Dance Kid's record releases, as no album was ever released.Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kids debuted on NBC on September 8 1973. It did not prove to be a success, as it lasted only one season. The second of the shows to debut in the 1973-1974 season utilized the talents of an existing pop star, Rick Springfield. Mission: Magic! was a spin-off of The Brady Kids.The second season episode of The Brady Kids, \"Teacher's Pet,\" introduced the character of teacher Miss Tickle, who played the central role in Mission: Magic!. On Misson: Magic! Miss Tickle was in charge of an after-school club called The Adventurers Club. Each week Rick Springfield would get in touch with Miss Tickle and The Adventurers Club through a gramophone. Miss Tickle would then create a magic portal by drawing a door on the blackboard. Miss Tickle and The Adventurers Club would then pass through the portal into some fantasy realm. There they would meet up with Rick Springfield and all of them would go on an adventure. Each episode Rick Springfield sang one of his songs.Rick Springfield's third solo album, Mission: Magic!, was released in association with the show, although it was only released in his native Australia. As to the show Mission: Magic! itself, it did not prove successful. It only aired for one season on ABC.Here it is worth mentioning a bit of interstitial programming that had debuted on January 6 1973. Schoolhouse Rock! featured songs teaching grammar, science, economics, history, mathematics, and civics.The interstitials proved very successful, running for seven seasons. Since then the series has been revived a few times.If the 1973-1974 season cannot be counted as the end of the cycle towards musical kid's show, the 1974-1975 season certainly could, with only one musical cartoon debuting. That show owed its existence to the success of The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show. Seeing the success of The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show, Hanna-Barbera decided to do a revival of The Jetsons featuring a grown-up Judy, who was now a reporter, and a teenage Elroy. Hanna-Barbera took this idea to Fred Silverman at CBS, who suggested instead that they do a futuristic show featuring The Partridge Family as well.Today Fred Silverman's suggestion might seem odd, particularly give The Partridge Family ended its run in 1974. That having been said, the latest trend in Saturday morning cartoons at the time was the revival of primetime television show as cartoons. Among these shows were Jeannie (inspired by I Dream of Jeannie), My Favorite Martians (a continuation of My Favorite Martian), Emergency+4 (a Saturday morning version of the primetime show Emergency!), and Star Trek. Making it even less strange that Fred Silverman would suggest  a show based around the Partridge Family is the fact that they had appeared in several episodes of Goober and the Ghost Chasers (another take-off on Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!) in the prior season. Partridge Family 2200 A.D. found the Partridge Family in the 23rd Century with no explanation. Danny Bonaduce, Suzanne Crough, and Brian Forster all voiced their characters from the original show. Susan Dey only voiced Laurie Partridge for two episodes before Sherry Alberoni took over the role . The characters of mother Shirley and oldest brother Keith were voiced by Joan Gerber and Chuck McLenan respectively. Their manager, Reuben Kinkaid did not appear on the show. Of course, every episode The Partridge Family performed one of their songs.The Partridge Family 2200 A.D. debuted on September 7 1974. As it turned out, Fred Silverman might have been better off if he had let Hanna-Barbera go ahead with their idea for a revival of The Jetsons. The Partridge Family 2200 A.D. only lasted one season.It would be a full two years before there would be another kid's show on Saturday morning that incorporated music. The Krofft Supershow debuted on September 11 1976 on ABC. It was essentially a variety show which featured such live-action segments as Dr. Shrinker, Electra Woman and Dyna Girl, Wonderbug, and repeats of The Lost Saucer. The show was hosted by Kaptain Kool and the Kongs, a group put together expressly for the show.Kaptain Kool and the Kongs were originally portrayed as a glam rock band in the first season. For their second season their image was toned down a bit. Unlike The Monkees before them (who, contrary to popular belief, had talent as musicians), for the most part Kaptain Kool and the Kongs were mere actors.  Bert Summer, who played Flatbush in the band, was a musician and had even played with The Left Banke and released his own solo albums prior to the show. Michael McMeel, who played drummer Turkey) was also a musician and would later play with Three Dog Night. Initially Kaptain Kool and the Kongs' songs were written by The Osmonds. This would later change when other songwriters were employed. Kaptain Kool and the Kongs released one album, Kaptain Kool and the Kongs, on Epic. One single was released, \"And I Never Dreamed.\" They were also featured on the children's album Stories from The Krofft Supershow, which also included comedy sketches from the show.  The Krofft Supershow moved to NBC for its third season. It was renamed The Krofft Superstar Hour and Kaptain Kool and the Kongs were replaced by The Bay City Rollers. In this new format it ran one last season.Ultimately, the boom in musical kid's shows on Saturday morning can be considered as lasting from 1968 to 1973, with The Partridge Family 2200 A.D. and The Krofft Supershow being mere echoes of the original cycle. It is not difficult to understand the emergence of the cycle. During the Sixties the cycle had such predecessors as The Alvin Show, The Beatles, and The Beagles. With the outcry over violence in Saturday morning cartoons growing in the Sixties, the animation studios had to look to genres beyond the superhero and adventure cartoons they had been producing. This would lead to the creation of The Banana Splits Adventure Hour and The Archie Show. The success of those two shows, along with the recording success of The Archies, sparked the cycle that would last for the first part of the Seventies.It is also not difficult to understand why the cycle ended. With the success of The Banana Splits Adventure Hour and The Archie Show, there was a rush to put even more musical kid's shows on Saturday morning. In the end there was a glut of such shows on the air. In the 1970-1971 season six new musical kid's shows debuted, so that there were no less than eight musical kid's shows on the broadcast networks in that season. This was compounded by the fact that none of the shows (with the exception of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids) repeated the success of The Archie Show. Certainly, none of them repeated the recording success of The Archies.Regardless, the cycle towards musical kid's shows in the late Sixties and early Seventies would be remembered. Many of the shows, such as The Banana Splits and The Archie Show, would persist in syndication for years. The Archies' songs, particularly \"Sugar Sugar,\" still receive airplay to this day. The musical kid's shows of the Sixties and Seventies may be gone, but they are not forgotten."},

The cycle peaked in the 1970-1971, with no less than six such shows debuting that fall. While no other season would see quite that many musical children's shows debut, the cycle would still continue for several more seasons.For earlier shows in the cycle fictional bands, such as The Banana Splits and The Archies, were created for the shows. In the 1971-1972 season, there would be one inspired by an actual band. The Jackson 5 had proven to be one of Motown's most successful acts of the late Sixties and early Seventies. They had their first no. 1 single, \"I Want You Back,\" in 1969. By the end of 1970 they had four consecutive no. 1 records. With music oriented cartoons dominating Saturday mornings, a cartoon based on The Jackson 5 perhaps seemed like a natural extension of the group's success.The Jackson 5ive was produced by Rankin/Bass in conjunction with Motown Productions. The animation was provided by British animation firm Halas and Batchelor and the Japanese animation firm of Topcraft. The Jackson Five did not provide their voices for the cartoon, with voice actors assuming their roles. That having been said, each episode would feature songs by The Jackson Five.The Jackson 5ive debuted on September 11 1971 on ABC. It proved successful, running for two seasons.Debuting the same day, but on CBS and a later time slot, was The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show. The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show was historic as the first televison spinoff of the highly successful primetime cartoon The Flintstones. On The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show,  Fred and Wilma Flintstone's daughter Pebbles and Barney and Betty Rubble's son Bamm-Bamm were now teenagers. The show then centred on Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm, and their friends, rather than their parents.Music played a role on the show, with Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm having formed a rock group called The Bedrock Rockers. The songs for the musical segments were written by such composers as David Gates of Bread, jazz pianist Elliot Lawrence, and others. They were performed by a group The Ron Hicklin Singers, who also recorded commercials, various television show themes, and even Patridge Family songs. Amazingly enough given the talent involved in the creation of the songs, it appears The Bedrock Rockers released no single nor any albums. Flintstones fans may remember that Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm had seen some recording success when they were still toddlers in the mid-Sixties. In 1965 \"Open Up Your Heart,\" a song performed by the two kids on an episode of The Flintstones was released as a single. That same year a Christmas album featuring Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm was released.The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show ran for one season before being revamped as The Flintstones Comedy Hour. On the new show the first half hour focused on Fred and Barney, not unlike the original show, with the second half hour centred on the teenaged Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm. The show lasted a single season in the new format.The Jackson 5ive and The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show were the only new musical cartoons to debut in the 1971-1972 season, but the 1972-1973 season would see four new cartoons debut and a revamp of an old cartoon debut on Saturday mornings. This was the most musical kid's shows to debut on Saturday morning since the 1970-1971 season.The first to debut was another cartoon based on an actual musical act. The Osmonds had appeared regularly on The Andy Williams Show. Starting with \"One Bad Apple,\" which went to no 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, The Osmonds began seeing success on the music charts. With the success of The Jackson 5ive, it would then perhaps be natural that there would be a cartoon based on The Osmonds as well. The Osmonds was produced by Rankin/Bass with the animation provided by Hass and Batchelor. The Osmonds did not provide their own voices, which were provided by voice actors. That having been said, Osmonds songs did appear in the episodes.The Osmonds did not meet with the success that The Jackson 5ive had. It only ran one season on Saturday morning before moving to Sunday morning for one final season.Opposite The Osmonds, on CBS, was The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan.  The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan was very loosely based on Earl Derr Biggers's original Charlie Chan novels and the many movies made in the Thirties and Forties. The cartoon gave Charlie Chan ten children. While Charlie Chan's \"Number One Son,\" \"Number Two Son,\" and \"Number Three Son\" all appeared in the movies, on the cartoon Charlie's sons all had different names. While his eldest sons in the movies were Lee (Number One) and Jimmy (Number Two), his sons on the cartoon had names like Henry, Stanley, and Scooter. There was a Tom Chan on the cartoon, whose name would correspond to Charlie's Number Three son in the movies, Tommy Chan.Given the cycle towards musical cartoons, it should come as no surprise that Charlie Chan's children on The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan had their own rock group, The Chan Clan. They would perform a song on each episode. The music for the show was produced by Don Kirshner, who had earlier produced the music for The Archie Show. Despite this, no album nor any singles were released in relation to the show.The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan did not prove successful. It only lasted one season on CBS.While The Osmonds was based on an actual music act, a show debuting later that day on ABC was a spinoff of a live-action, primetime sitcom. It was Brady Bunch creator Sherwood Schwartz who approached Filmation about creating an animated series featuring the kids from The Brady Bunch. The end result was The Brady Kids. The Brady Kids centred exclusively on the children from The Brady Bunch, with neither their parents nor the housekeeper Alice appearing o the show. In the first season the child actors from The Brady Bunch (Barry Williams, Maureen McCormick, Christopher Knight, Eve Plumb, Mike Lookinland, and Susan Olsen) voiced their characters, with voice actors taking over the roles in the second season.As to the music on the show, it is sometimes forgotten that the kids from The Brady Bunch actually recorded albums, the first being a Christmas album in 1970, followed by Meet the Brady Bunch in 1972. The Brady Kids then included a musical segment at the end of each episode. As the children from The Brady Bunch were already recording albums, there were not any albums or singles specifically from the show released, although their 1972 album The Kids From the Brady Bunch used artwork from the show.Opposite The Brady Kids there was a reboot of a slightly older cartoon on CBS. On Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, the band is doing a promotional tour of the launch site of a new spaceship when they are accidentally launched into space. New songs were recorded for the new show, although no album or singles were released. Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space ran a season and a half on CBS.It was later on September 9 1972 on CBS that what was the most successful of the cartoons to emerge from the cycle of musical kid's shows debuted. Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids ultimately lasted thirten seasons, although it slightly changed formats during that time. The character of Fat Albert had first appeared on the comedy album Revenge from now disgraced comedian Bill Cosby. On November 12 1969 a primetime special, Hey, Hey, Hey, It's Fat Albert aired on NBC. The animation for the special was provided by Ken Mundie, who had earlier did the animation for the opening titles of the movie The Great Race (1965).Bill Cosby tried to interest NBC in a Fat Albert series, but the network expressed no interest in it. The project then went to Filmation, who had earlier produced The New Adventures of Superman and The Archie Show. It was then sold to CBS.  The images of the characters on Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids were very different from what they had been in the special, Hey, Hey, Hey, It's Fat Albert, particularly Fat Albert himself. The series' episodes featured a live action opening by Bill Cosby, as well as a musical segment at the end of the show. The Junkyard Gang (as Fat Albert and his friends called themselves) would sing a song about the topic that day's episode had dealt with.The songs on Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids were written by Richard Canada and Sherry Gaden. They were produced by Richard Delvy. An album, Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, was released on Paramount Records.In 1979 Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids was renamed The New Fat Albert Show, and the songs were phased out. In 1984 the show moved from CBS to first run syndication, where it was retitled The New Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. It lasted until 1985 in syndication.The 1972-1973 season would be the second biggest season for musical kid's shows on Saturday morning following the 1970-1971 season. The cycle would continue in following seasons, but never again would as many musical children's shows debut."},
{"title": "Saturday Morning Musical Kid's Shows of the 1960s and 1970s Part Three", "date": "Wednesday, July 14, 2021", "text": "In 1968 The Banana Splits Adventure Hour and The Archie Show debuted on Saturday morning on the American broadcast networks. The Banana Splits Adventure Hour was essentially a variety show featuring cartoons and musical segment with the show's hosts, the musical group The Banana Splits. The Archie Show was a cartoon based on the popular Archie Comics characters and included a musical segment in addition to two eight minute stories. The two of them ranked among the top rated cartoons of the 1968-1969 seasons. In doing so, they kicked off a cycle of musical kid's shows on Saturday mornings that would last for five years.In the 1969-1970 season three cartoons debuted that incorporated music into the shows. There would be even more kid's show utilizing music that debuted in the 1970-1971 season. The first to debut could well have been the most bizarre show to have ever aired on Saturday morning. Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp was a live action spy parody that starred real, live chimpanzees. The show centred on secret agent Lancelot Link and his partner Mata Hairi who were agents for A.P.E. (the Agency to Prevent Evil). A.P.E.'s opponents were C.H.U.M.P. (the Criminal Headquarters for Underworld Master Plan), Lancelot and Mata reported to Darwin. Their major opponent on the show was Baron Von Butcher of C.H.U.M.P. The show owed a lot to Get Smart, with Bernie Koppell, who had played Siegfried on Get Smart, providing the voice for Baron Von Butcher. Stan Burns and Mike Marmer, who had written for Get Smart, created the show.In addition to the spy parodies featured on the show, Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp also featured musical segments with The Evolution Revolution, an all chimp band consisting of Lancelot and his fellow chimps. The songs were written by Steve Hoffman. who would later work on The Muppet Show. An album, Lancelot Link and The Evolution Revolution, was released on ABC/Dunhill. The single, \"Sha-La Love You,\" was a song originally written for The Grass Roots. Neither the album nor the single charted.Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp debuted on ABC on September 12 1970. It ran for two seasons.Debuting in the same time slot on September 12 1970, but on CBS instead, was a show that was not entirely new. In 1968 The Archie Show proved enormously successful, so much so that in 1969 it was expanded into The Archie Comedy Hour. Among the segments featured on the show were ones starring Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Sabrina had first appeared in Archie's Madhouse no. 22 (October 1962). Contrary to popular belief, Sabrina did not live in Riverdale alongside Archie and his gang, but in the town of Greendale. For the 1970-1971 season Sabrina was spun-off into her own show, Sabrina and the Groovie Goolies. The Groovie Goolies of the title were not Archie Comics characters, but instead characters created by Filmation. They consisted of parodies of the classic Universal monsters, including Drac (based on Dracula), Frankie (based on Frankenstein's monster), and Wolfie (based on the Wolf Man).Drac, Frankie, and Wolfie had their own band, The Monster Trio, and they performed in musical segments on the show. What set Sabrina and the Groovie Goolies apart from other musical cartoons is that it featured guest bands each week. Among these were The Bare Bones Band (three skeletons), The Mummies and the Puppies, The Rolling Headstones (three anthropomorphic headstones), and The Spirits of '76. As might be expected, an album, The Groovie Goolies, was released on RCA/Victor. Two singles, \"First Annual Semi-Formal Combination Celebration Meet-the-Monster Population Party\" and \"Save Your Good Lovin' For Me,\" were released, but neither charted. That is not to say no hits emerged from Sabrina and the Groovie Goolies. \"Chick-A-Boom (Don't Ya Jes' Love It),\" a song performed by The Rolling Headstones on the show, was reworked by Dick Monda (one of the musicians on the show)  and released it as a single in 1971. It reached no. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100.Sabrina and the Groovy Goolies ran for one season. With the 1971-1972 season Sabrina the Teenage Witch was separated from The Groovie Goolies. Sabrina the Teenage Witch remained on Saturday morning, while The Groovy Goolies moved to Sunday for one more season.On NBC, competing against the last half hours of Lancelot, Secret Chimp and Sabrina and the Groovie Goolies, was the live-action show The Bugaloos. The Bugaloos was produced by Sid and Marty Krofft and centred on the band of the title. The Bugaloos were four teenagers who wore insect themed outfits. They consisted of I.Q. (John McIndoe), a guitarist, Harmony (Wayne Laryea), the keyboardist, Courage (John Philpott) the drummer, and Joy (Caroline Ellis) on tambourine. They lived in Tranquility Forest, where they were constantly under threat from the witch Benita Bizarre. Supremely untalented as singer, Benita envied The Bugaloos. She lived in a gigantic jukebox from which she would blare her singularly unpleasant music. For The Bugaloos over 5000 people were auditioned in the spring of 1970. Among those who auditioned for the show was none other than Phil Collins. The show's music director was Hal Yoergler, who wrote many of the songs for The Bugaloos as well. The show's theme was written by Norman Gimbel and Charles Fox, who not only wrote the song \"Killing Me Softly with His Song,\" but the theme songs for such shows as Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley. An album, The Bugaloos, was released on Capitol Records. The single, \"For a Friend,\" actually saw some success. It bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at no. 118.The Bugaloos ran for two seasons on NBC, with the second consisting entirely of reruns.Following Sabrina and the Groovie Goolies on CBS was another musical cartoon, Josie and the Pussycats. The success Filmation had with The Archie Show in 1968 led rival Hanna-Barbera to try its own musical cartoon. To this end they contacted Archie Comics for one of their titles that could be adapted for just such a cartoon. The character of Josie had appeared in her own title since 1963. The comic book Josie was essentially a teen humour book, not unlike the Archie comic books, following the adventures of Josie and her friends in the small town of Midvale. In anticipation of the cartoon, the comic book Josie was retitled Josie and the Pussycats with issue no. 45 (December 1969). It was in that issue that Josie formed a rock group with her friend Melody and a new girl in school, Valerie. Additional members of the comic book's cast were Alan, the band's roadie, Alexander, the band's manager, Alexandra,  Alexander's twin sister and Josie's rival, and Alexandra's cat Sebastian.Like the comic book, the cartoon focused on Josie and the Pussycats as they performed around the country. It owed a little bit to Hanna-Barbera's own Scooby Doo, Where Are You!, with the band solving mysteries, although theirs were not supernatural in nature as those on Scooby Doo, Where Are You! were.Music was central to Josie and the Pussycats. The recordings were produced by La La Productions, who auditioned young women who could sing and  resembled The Pussycats on the cartoon. Cathy Dougher (also known as Cathy Douglas) was the singing voice of Josie. The singing voice of Valerie was Patrice Holloway, who had recorded singles for Capitol Records in the mid-Sixties and co-wrote the Blood Sweat & Tears hit \"You've Made Me So Very Happy.\" Today the singing voice of Melody is perhaps the best known. Her voice was Cherie Moor, who would become better known as Cheryl Ladd on Charlie's Angels. An album, Josie and the Pussycats, was released on Capitol Records.Josie and the Pussycats ran for two seasons on CBS. It was then reconceived as Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space in 1972.Opposite Josie and the Pussycats on CBS was The Further Adventures of Doctor Doolittle on NBC. 20th Century Fox had earlier produced the animated series Journey to the Center of the Earth, Fantastic Voyage, and The Hardy Boys in conjunction with Filmation. The Further Adventures of Doctor Doolittle was produced in conjunction with DePatie-Freleng. The show was loosely based on Hugh Lofting's original books and the 1967 20th Century Fox movie Doctor Doolittle.In some respects the musical Doctor Doolittle (1967) might seem like unlikely inspiration for a cartoon. After all, it had bombed so badly at the box office that it very nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox. That having been said, The Further Adventures of Doctor Doolittle resembled the movie very little. Indeed, Doctor Doolittle did not break into song every five to ten minutes. That having been said, it was not entirely without a musical component or else it would not be included in this post. A rock group consisting of a group of grasshoppers, fittingly called The Grasshoppers, lived in Doctor Dolittle's medicine case. At some point during each episode they would perform a song.An album, Doctor Doolittle Presents The Grasshoppers, was released in Carousel Records and distributed by Bell Records. The songs were written by Doug Goodwin, who regularly composed music for DePatie-Freleng's theatrical shorts and cartoons.The Further Adventures of Doctor Doolittle proved to be a bit more successful than the movie upon which it was based, managing to last two seasons on NBC.Following Josie and the Pussycats on CBS was one of the odder musical cartoons to air in the late Sixties or the Seventies. Harlem Globetrotters followed the adventures of the famous exhibition basketball team. Each episode generally consisted of the Globetrotters becoming involved in some dispute, which would be settled by a basketball game.It might seem as if music would not play a role in such a show, but in fact it did. Songs were played during the basketball games. Don Kirshner was the show's musical supervisor and he also produced the album that accompanied the show, The Globetrotters. The Globetrotters, was released on Kirshner Records and distributed by RCA Records. A single, \"Rainy Day Bells\" (a cover of a Neil Sedaka tune) , was released but did not chart. That having been said, the Globetrotters' version of \"Rainy Day Bells\" would become popular as Carolina beach music.Before departing the 1970-1971 season and going onto part four in this series, I should mention a change that was made to a cartoon that had debuted in 1969-1970 season. Namely, songs were added to the chase scenes of the new, second season episodes of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!. Like the songs on Josie and the Pussycats, these songs were produced by LaLa Productions. They were written by Danny Janssen and Austin Roberts. Austin Roberts recorded the songs, as well as a new version of the theme song. If it seems odd that Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! incorporated music into its second season episodes, it must be considered that the cartoon was originally conceived as a musical cartoon. Originally titled Mysteries Five it would have followed the adventures of a rock group who also solve supernatural mysteries. While in development the music angle was dropped and Mysteries Five evolved into Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!.The 1970-1971 season was the peak of the cycle towards musical kids shows on Saturday morning television. Never again would as many musical children's shows debut on the Saturday morning programming block. That having been said, the cycle was far from over and many more musical kid's shows would debut in the next few years."},
{"title": "Saturday Morning Musical Kid's Shows of the 1960s and 1970s Part Two", "date": "Tuesday, July 13, 2021", "text": "In the Sixties animated television series emerged in the United States in which pop music played a large role. Among these shows were The Alvin Show, The Beatles, and The Beagles. In 1968, largely spurred by the success of the primetime sitcom The Monkees, two Saturday morning children's shows debuted that incorporated music as part of the shows. The Banana Splits Adventure Hour and The Archie Show started a whole cycle towards musical kid's shows on Saturday morning that lasted for five years.It was in 1967 that William Hanna and Joseph Barbera conceived a show that would be hosted by anthropomorphic characters who were part of a bubblegum pop band. To this ended they contracted brothers Sid and Marty Krofft to create the costumes. The Banana Splits consisted of Fleegle, a dog and the band's guitarist, Bingo, an ape and the band's drummer, Drooper, a lion and the band's bassist, and Snorky, an elephant and the band's keyboardist. It was also early in the show's pre-production that Hanna-Barbera found a sponsor in the form of Kellogg's. The band was originally meant to be called \"The Banana Bunch,\" but it turned out that was already the title of a children's book and the author was unwilling to let Hanna-Barbera use the title. This caused problems for Kellogg's, who had already printed 1.25 million cereal boxes with the name \"The Banana Bunch.\" Every one of them had to be destroyed.The format of The Banana Splits Adventure Hour would be inspired by two primetime shows. Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In provided the basic framework of the show, with The Banana Splits performing both comedy sketches and songs in between cartoons that aired on the show. Both The Banana Splits themselves and their musical segments owed a good deal to The Monkees. In addition to the segments featuring The Banana Splits, other segments were included on the show. Arabian Knights was an adventure cartoon set in a fantasy version of medieval Persia. The Three Musketeers was a cartoon based on the popular novel. Danger Island was a live action segment about an archaeologist, his daughter, and his assistant having adventures on an uncharted island. Micro Ventures was a segment that only lasted for four episodes, in which a scientist shrinks himself and his family in order to explore the world around them. In the second season Arabian Knights was replaced by reruns of The Hillbilly Bears (originally a segment on The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show).Music was a major part of The Banana Splits Adventure Hour, and some well-known professionals provided The Banana Splits with their songs. Al Kooper, Barry White, Gene Pitney, and Jimmy Radcliffe all contributed songs to The Banana Splits, although none of them performed on the recordings. An album, We're The Banana Splits, was released in 1968 on Decca. The Banana Splits released three singles. Neither their first single, \"Wait Til Tomorrow\"/\"We're The Banana Splits\" (released in 1968) nor their third single \"Long Live Love\"/\"Pretty Painted Carousel\" (released in 1969) saw much in the way of success. Their second single \"The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)\" (single version)/\"Toy Piano Melody,\" proved a bit more successful, although it was hardly a huge hit. \"The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)\" (which was the show's theme song) peaked at no. 96 on the Billboard Hot 100.The Banana Splits Adventure Hour debuted on September 7 1968 on NBC and proved to be a huge success. In fact, it was the number one show on Saturday mornings for the 1968-1969 season. Unfortunately, it would falter in the 1969-1970 season. In its second season The Banana Split Adventure Hour found itself opposite a brand new cartoon, Scooby Doo, Where Are You? and The Archie Comedy Hour (an expanded version of the previous season's The Archie Show) on CBS. The Banana Splits Adventure Hour dropped in the ratings as a result and was cancelled at the end of the season.It was a week after The Banana Splits Adventure Hour debuted, on September 14 1968, that The Archie Show debuted on CBS. The Archie Show was based on the comic book character Archie Andrews and his assorted friends (Jughead, Betty, Veronica, and Reggie), who had first appeared in Pep Comics no. 22 (December 1941). Archie had proven extremely successful, not only spurring an entire cycle of teen humour comic books, but inspiring a newspaper comic strip and a long-running radio show. It was Irv Wilson, Filmation's agent at the time, who brought Archie to the animation studio. Mr. Wilson had approached John Goldwater, the head of Archie Comics, about licensing Archie and his associated characters for a show. According to Lou Scheimer in his book Lou Scheimer: Creating the Filmation Generation, he had never even heard of Archie when Irv Wilson called him about the idea. Mr. Scheimer met with John Goldwater and the two worked out a deal for the television rights to Archie.It was decided early in the project that music would play a part on the show. This idea actually originated in the comic books. Life with Archie was an Archie Comics title that often featured stories set in realities alternate from that of the mainstream Archie reality. Among these were parodies of popular television shows or superheroes, such as \"The Man from R.I.V.E.R.D.A.L.E.\" parodying The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Among the shows parodied in Life with Archie was The Monkees. A series of stories featuring a rock group called The Archies began in Life with Archie no. 60, April 1967. The feature ended with Life with Archie no. 66 (October 1967). Here it must be pointed out that The Archies in Life with Archie differed a bit from The Archies on television. Namely, Betty and Veronica were not part of the band, which consisted of Archie, Jughead, and Reggie.To provide music for the show, Filmation went to Don Kirshner. Don Kirshner had a notorious falling out with both The Monkees and the producers of the TV show The Monkees, so the idea of a fictional band that he could completely control appealed to him. The fictional band consisted of Archie on guitar, Jughead on drums, Reggie on bass, Betty on tambourine, and Veronica on keyboards. Of course, in reality the music was provided by session musicians hired by Don Kirshner. The songs were written by such composers as Jeff Barry, Andy Kim, Mark Barkham, and Ritchie Adams. Lead vocals were provided by Ron Dante.For a time the fictional band The Archies would prove very successful. Their first single, \"Bang-Shang-A-Lang,\" peaked at no. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their third single, \"Sugar Sugar,\" did even better. It went all the way to no. 1. Its follow-up single, \"Jingle Jangle,\" peaked at no. 10. Ultimately, The Archies released 10 singles from 1968 to 1972, although by 1971 they were no longer charting. Even The Archies' first two albums did moderately well. Their first album, The Archies, went to no. 88 on the Billboard album chart. Their second album, Everything's Archie, went to no. 66.Unlike The Beatles and The Beagles before it, the songs on The Archie Show were not incorporated into the stories featured on the show themselves. In fact, the stories on the show made no mention of a rock group called \"The Archies.\" Instead, the show's format consisted of two eight minute story segments and one three minute song segment. The Archie Show proved highly successful and would undergo various format changes through the years. It expanded to an hour to become The Archie Comedy Hour in the 1969-1970 season. In the 1970-1971 season it became Archie's Funhouse, complete with a live audience. It was with the 1971-1972 season that music no longer played the central role on the show that it had. It became Archie's Television Funnies, featuring segments based on various newspaper comic strips (such as Dick Tracy and Nancy). Ultimately, Archie and his pals would appear in some form on Saturday morning until the 1977-1978 season.The success of The Banana Splits Adventure Hour and The Archie Show in the 1968-1969 season would lead to the debut of  three cartoons that incorporated music in some way, shape, or form in the 1969-1970 season. What is more, all three debuted on ABC on September 6 1969. The first of these shows was Hanna-Barbera's Cattanooga Cats. Cattanooga Cats owed a good deal to the format of The Banana Splits Adventure Hour. The primary difference is that instead of a live-action band of people in suits, it featured an animated band instead. The Cattanooga Cats were a band of anthropomorphic cats consisting of lead guitarist and vocalist Country,vocalist Kitty Jo, bassist Scoots, and drummer Groove. They appeared in both their own adventures as well as in bumpers between the other cartoons on the show. As to the other cartoons, they were Around the World in 79 Days (inspired by Jules Verne novel Around the World in Eighty Days), It's the Wolf! (which centred around Mildew Wolf, who was constantly trying to catch a lamb named Lambsy), and Motormouse and Autocat (essentially Tom and Jerry on wheels).Music played a central role on The Cattanooga Cats. The lead vocals were performed by by Michael Lloyd and Peggy Clinger. The songwriters included by Michael Lloyd, Peggy Clingerm Mike Curb, Guy Hemric, and Harley Hatcher. An album, Cattanooga Cats, was released through Curb Records. The songs \"Mother May I\" and \"Merry-Go-Round\" were released as singles. Neither the album, nor the singles charted.The Cattanooga Cats did not meet with a good deal of success in the ratings either. For its second season, The Cattanooga Cats was shortened to a half hour, with Motormouse and Autocat and It's the Wolf spun off into The Motormouse and Autocat Show. It ended its run after two seasons.The second show to debut was The Hardy Boys, based on the popular series of juvenile novels of the same name. Like The Archie Show before it, it was a product of Filmation. In the mid-Sixties 20th Century Fox had produced a pilot for a live-action series based on \"The Hardy Boys.\" That pilot aired on NBC on September 8 1967. Unfortunately, it did poorly in the ratings and as a result they did not pick up the series. 20th Century Fox had produced the animated series Journey to the Center of the Earth (based on the movie of the same name) in conjunction with Filmation in 1967 and then Fantastic Voyage (based on the movie of the same name)in 1968. At the same time The Archie Show was doing phenomenally well in the ratings. 20th Century Fox then approached Filmation with the idea of doing an animated Hardy Boys series which would also incorporate music. The show was pitched to ABC in February 1969 and the network placed it on their schedule.Arguably, The Hardy Boys  was very loosely based on the novels. As in the novels. Joe and Frank Hardy, the sons of detective Fenton Hardy, solve mysteries with the help of their friends, including Chet Morton. The cartoon departed from the novels in that Joe and Frank also had a rock group, that featured Chet Morton and new characters Wanda Kay and Pete Jones. It further departed from the novels in making Chet overweight and giving him the nickname \"Chubby.\" Each episode consisted of two mysteries, during which The Hardy Boys would have to take time out to perform a song at a club, a fair, or some other venue.For the music for the show Filmation looked to Dunwich Productions in Chicago. As a result the show featured the work of some well-known songwriters, including Ellie Greenwich, as well as Al Kasha, Joel Hirschorn. One thing that separated The Hardy Boys from other musical cartoons is that a real band was formed to compliment the cartoon. After all, the disadvantage of The Archie Show was that The Archies couldn't actually tour. As a real band, The Hardy Boys could. The Hardy Boys consisted of Jeff Taylor (Joe Hardy), Reed Kailing (Frank Hardy), Nibs Soltysiak (Chubby Morton), Deven English (Wanda Kay), and Bob Crowder (Pete Jones). While the actual band did not voice their characters on the show (that was handled by such experienced voice artists Dallas McKennon and Jane Webb), they performed the songs on the show and appeared in both the opening and closing credits. The Hardy Boys would release two albums (Here Come The Hardys and Wheels) and the singles \"Love and Let Love,\" \"Wheels,\" and \"Love Train\" on RCA Victor. \"Love and Let Love\"actually saw some success, bubbling under the Billboard Hot 100 at 101.The Hardy Boys lasted only two seasons, coming to an end at the close of 1970-1971 season.The third show that incorporated music to debut in the 1969-1970 season was rather unique. Hot Wheels was based on the popular line of toy cars manufactured by Mattel. It centred on a group of teenage car racers called the Hot Wheels Club. Unlike The Banana Splits Adventure Hour, The Archie Show,. Cattanooga Cats and The Hardy Boys, no band appeared on the show. Regardless, songs would often play during the various races on the show. Because of this , a soundtrack album for the carton, The Original Hot Wheels Soundtrack was released. The music was provided by Mike Curb, who had also written for The Cattanooga Cats.While none of the musical cartoons of the 1969-1970 season repeated the success of either The Banana Splits Adventure Hour or The Archie Show, the success of those two shows guaranteed that there would be more musical kid's shows in the following season. In fact, no less that six musical kids shows would debut in the 1970-1971 season, marking the height of the cycle."},

It was during that period that a cycle of cartoons and other kid's shows incorporated music in some way, shape, or form took place. Among the more successful of these shows were The Banana Splits Adventure Hour, The Archie Show, and Josie and the Pussycats. Some of these shows even produced hits on the Billboard Hot 100. At five years it was one of the longer cycles on Saturday mornings on the broadcast networks, and many of the shows remain remembered to this day.While the cycle began in 1968 with the debuts of The Archie Show and The Banana Splits Adventure Hour, there were precursors on American television to the musical cartoons that aired in the late Sixties and early Seventies. In fact, the first one aired at the beginning of the decade and on primetime at that. The 1960-1961 saw the beginning of a cycle towards cartoons in primetime with The Bugs Bunny Show and The Flintstones. Among the shows that followed in the wake of The Flintstones was The Alvin Show. The Alvin Show was inspired by the highly successful recording act The Chipmunks. The Chipmunks were characters created by Ross Bagdasarian (who performed under the stage name David Seville), who recorded his voice at high speeds to create the voices of the three chipmunks, Alvin, Theodore, and Simon. \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\" proved to be a huge hit during the holiday season of 1958 and was followed by further singles and albums featuring The Chipmunks.Given the success of The Chipmunks, it was perhaps inevitable that they would find their way to television. It was then that The Alvin Show was produced by Format Films, an animation company founded by UPA veteran Herbert Klynn in 1959. The show consisted of seven minute segments featuring The Chipmunks and David Seville, as well as inept inventor Clyde Crashcup. What really set The Alvin Show apart from other animated series on at the time was that it also featured a musical segment , separate from the episodes, with one of The Chipmunks' songs. Here it must be pointed out that the tone of The Alvin Show was quite different from the sweeter, gentler Alvin and the Chipmunks of the Eighties. In fact, Alvin could quite rightfully be considered a precursor to Bart Simpson.The Alvin Show ran for only one season in primetime, after which it was rerun on Saturday morning for several years. It would prove successful in syndication, where it still occasionally appears. As of yet the complete series has not been released on DVD. While The Alvin Show might not have proven a success in primetime, it certainly set a precedent for blending animation with music on American television.The following animated television series incorporating music would also be based on an existing music act, although in its case it would be based on real people rather than characters created for a novelty record. The Beatles had been phenomenally successful in their native Britain and proved phenomenally successful in the United States as well. It was Al Brodax, head of motion picture and television development at King Features Syndicate, who got the rights to do a Saturday morning cartoon based on The Beatles. He got financing from toy company A. C. Gilbert Company with little more than a rough outline and preliminary artwork. A. C. Gilbert sold the series to ABC.On the The Beatles, the characters' speaking voices did not sound like the Fab Four.  Al Brodax hired Paul Frees to voice John Lennon and George Harrison and Lance Percival to voice Paul and Ringo. Thinking that Americans would not understand Liverpudlian accents, Al Brodax did not allow the actors to imitate The Beatles' actual voices. In particular, John Lennon sounded more like Inspector Fenwick from Dudley Do-Right (who Paul Frees had also voiced) than the actual John Lennon. It was largely because of the voices that Brian Epstein banned the cartoon from airing in the United Kingdom. It would not make its debut there until the late 1980s. The Beatles themselves initially were not happy with the cartoon, with John Lennon complaining that it made them look like the Flintstones.Regardless, The Beatles was the first animated cartoon made for television to be based on real people, beating the Three Stooges cartoon by a few weeks. It was also a hit. Debuting on September 25 1965, it proved to be the number one Saturday morning cartoon of the 1965-1966 season. Unlike The Alvin Show, The Beatles' songs were incorporated into the episodes, not unlike their movies A Hard Day's Night and Help!. The Beatles also featured a sing-along segment involving one of their songs.The Beatles would prove successful enough to last three seasons on Saturday morning, after which it would spend one more season on Sunday morning. The success of The Beatles would lead to further cartoons that incorporated music. What is more they would not be long in coming.Indeed, no less than two Saturday morning cartoons featuring rock groups would debut in the 1966-1967 season. The first of the two to debut was Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles. Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles featured a segment starring The Impossibles, a rock group who were also superheroes (Multi-Man, Coil Man, and Fluid Man). They reported to the mysterious Big D, who communicated with them through Coil Man's guitar. Despite the fact that The Impossibles centred on a rock group, music played a very small role on the cartoon. Episodes centred primarily on their adventures as superheroes, with only brief snatches of The Impossibles performing as a band. Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles debuted on CBS on September 10 1966 and lasted two seasons.It was later on September 10 1966 that a cartoon more significant to the history of musical cartoons on Saturday morning debuted. The Beagles was created by W. Watts Biggers, Treadwell Covington, and Joseph Harris of Total Television, the same company responsible for such classics as Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales and Underdog. Due to their name, some might think The Beagles were inspired by The Beatles, but the two lead characters were inspired by the comedy team of Martin and Lewis and owed more to such British duos as Chad and Jeremy and Peter and Gordon. The Beagles followed the adventures of Stringer (the Dean Martin of the duo) and Tubby (the Jerry Lewis of the duo). The Beagles' manager was Scotty, who was constantly involving the two in sometime dangerous publicity stunts.Unlike Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles, music played an important role on The Beagles. Original songs by Chester Stover, W. Watts Biggers, Treadwell Covington, and Joseph Harris were written for the show. The songs were incorporated into episodes, not unlike The Beatles. In fact, The Beagles would be historic as the first cartoon band to have an album and single released. Here Come The Beagles was released on Harmony, a subsidiary of Columbia Records. The single, \"Looking For The Beagles\"/\"I Want To Capture You\" was released on Columbia Records itself. Neither the album nor the single charted, but they did set a precedent with regards to fictional bands on cartoons releasing albums and singles. In the coming years, it would become common place.The Beagles lasted a single season on CBS, before moving to ABC where it was rerun on Sundays. For a long time the series was feared lost, but decades later it turned up at Golden Books Entertainment, who had bought the Total Television properties.What was perhaps the most influential show with regards to the Saturday morning musical kid's shows of the Sixties and Seventies did not air on Saturday morning, nor was it made for children. The Monkees debuted on NBC on September 12 1966. The Monkees was a sitcom inspired by The Beatles' movies  A Hard Day's Night and Help! (among other things) and centred on the rock group of that name. Although it certainly appealed to children, The Monkees aired in primetime and was made primarily for teenagers and young adults. Music was central to the show, with songs incorporated both in the plots of episodes and in separate musical segments.The Monkees was only moderately successful in the Nielsen ratings, but proved to be a huge success on the music charts. Their first four albums hit no. 1 on the Billboard album chart, and the band boasted three number one singles. The Monkees would be pivotal in the incorporation of music into children's shows on Saturday morning. In fact, it was one year after The Monkees ended its two season run that reruns of the show would join the Saturday morning line-up on CBS.It was in part because of The Monkees that in the fall of 1968 two kid's shows that incorporated music debuted on Saturday morning. It was that season that The Banana Splits Adventure Hour and The Archie Show debuted. Saturday morning would never be the same."},

Regardless of how one feels about astrology, I have to admit it is as good an excuse as any to show some good movies. Every Tuesday this month TCM Spotlight is on Star Signs with Susan Miller. Susan Miller is an astrologer who has written eleven books on the subject and a regular columnist for Vogue and InStyle. She will co-host with Alicia Malone, talking about the qualities of each sign and how they apply to particular stars. Of course, this means we get to see some fine movies as well.Indeed, over the course of the month Turner Classic Movie will show such films as The Long, Long Trailer (1954), The Cincinnati Kid (1965), Love in the Afternoon (1957), To Have and Have Not (1944), Rebel without a Cause (1955), and Gilda (1946). Among the stars who will be discussed are Lucille Ball, Steve McQueen, Audrey Hepburn, James Dean, and Rita Hayworth.If I have one caveat about Star Signs with Susan Miller, it is their choice of Elizabeth Taylor for Pisceans and the characterization of Pisceans as \"highly sociable.\" I must admit that I have my doubts about astrology, at the same time I feel that my Piscean friends and I have a great deal in common. Among those things most of us have in common is that we are not \"highly sociable\" and tend towards introversion. In that regard, I think Elizabeth Taylor may be atypical of Pisceans, so that Sidney Poitier or Jean Harlow or another more introverted actor may have been a better choice for the sign. I do have to agree that Pisceans tend to be romantic (although not all of my Piscean friends are), intuitive, and loyal and generous as well. Of course, then again, there could be nothing to astrology and any similarities between my Piscean friends and I may just be because, well, thet're my friends (\"birds of a feather...\" and all that).Below are my choices of movies to watch during TCM Spotlight: Star Signs with Susan MillerTuesday, July 67:00 PM The Cincinnati Kid (1965)11:00 PM The Bad and the Beautiful (1953)Tuesday, July 137:00 PM Love in the Afternoon (1957)9:30 PM Grand Hotel (1932)11:30 PM To Have and Have Not (1944)Tuesday, July 207:00 PM Rebel without a Cause (1955) 11:15 PM Gilda (1946)Tuesday, July 2711:00 PM The Gay Divorcee (1934)"},
{"title": "Special Theme on TCM: From Hollywood to the Heartland", "date": "Friday, July 2, 2021", "text": "Shirley Jones & Robet Prestonin The Music ManOn Wednesdays in the month of July, Turner Classic Movies is showing movies with the special theme of \"From Hollywood to the Heartland.\" The Heartland is often equated with the Midwest, which the United States Census Bureau defines as the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. That having been said, I don't think the Heartland is necessarily the same as the Midwest, as here in Mid-Missouri one almost never hears of the area called \"the Heartland.\" In fact one will not hear the phrase \"Heartland\"\" in Missouri until one gets as far north as Kirksville, which isn't far from the Iowa border.Regardless, TCM is using the word \"Heartland\" metaphorically, so that they are showing movies set in New England, California, and Texas as well as the Midwest. They are using it, in the words of the article on TCM's website on the special theme, of \"..the heart and soul of America, those places associated with small-town life and old-fashioned values.\" To this end, Turner Classic Movies' special theme From Hollywood to the Heartland features such classic movies as Peyton Place (1957), Picnic (1955), The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944), Theodora Goes Wild (1936), and The Music Man (1962). It is showing two movies with close ties to Missouri. One is Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), based on the novel by St. Louis native Sally Besson. Another is King's Row (1942), based on the novel by Henry Bellamann. Mr. Bellamann's novel was in turn based very thinly on his hometown of Fulton, Missouri.From Hollywood to the Heartland features a sterling line-up of movies, so much so that I only have two complaints. The first is in the scheduling of some of the movies. I wish they hadn't scheduled Knig's Row so late. It is airing at 2:00 AM! I also wish they would show The Music Man and Meet Me in St. Louis earlier. As much as I love Bye, Bye Birdie, both The Music Man and Meet Me in St. Louis number among my favourite movies of all time. My second complaint is that curiously To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) isn't on the schdule as part of the special theme. The movie is a much about small town life as it is its racially charged trial. In some respects it might be more fitting to show To Kill a Mockingbird during From Hollywood to the Heartland than Meet Me in St. Louis, given Maycomb, Alabama is a small town and St. Louis most certainly isn't.Regardless, many will find From Hollywood to the Heartland very enjoyable, including myself. Below is the schedule of movies being shown. All times are central.Wednesday, July 77:00 PM Peyton Place (1957)9:45 PM Picnic (1955)11:45 PM East of Eden (1955)2:00 AM King's Row (1942)4:15 AM Our Town (1940)Wednesday, July 147:00 PM  The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944)8:45 PM Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)11:00 PM Theordora Goes Wild (1936)12:45 AM A Stranger in Town (1943)2:00 AM Small Town Girl(1936)4:00 AM Love Finds Andy Hardy (1936)Wednesday, July 217:00 PM Bye, Bye Birdie (1963)9:00 PM The Music Man (1962)11:45 PM Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)1:45 AM Janie (1944)3:45 AM Four Daughters (1938)Wednesday, July 287:00 PM Some Came Running (1958)9:30 PM Paper Moon (1973)11:30 PM The Last Picture Show (1971)1:45 AM Bonnie and Clyde (1967)3:45 AM Badlands (1973)"},
{"title": "The 50th Anniversary of Willy Wonka &  the Chocolate Factory (1971)", "date": "Thursday, July 1, 2021", "text": "Yesterday, June 30 2021, marked fifty years since the release of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971). Since then it has come to be regarded as a classic family film. It might surprise some that the movie was not a huge success upon its initial release.The origins of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory go back to the children's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl, published in 1964. Among the novel's fans was director Mel Stuart's daughter Melanie. It was in 1969 that then twelve year old Melanie Stuart approached her father and told her that he wanted him to make the book into a movie and \"have Uncle Dave sell it.\" 'Uncle Dave\" was Mel Stuart's friend, producer David L. Wolper. Although he was no relation to Mel Stuart or his daughter, they were close enough that he was called \"Uncle Dave.\"Mel Stuart read the novel himself and then took it to David L. Wolper. Mr. Wolper agreed that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory would make a good movie. It was only a few weeks later that David L. Wolper announced that he had made a deal with the Quaker Oats Company to buy the rights to the book and finance the film. David L. Wolper had recently produced a television special titled Say Goodbye that was sponsored by Quaker Oats. The ad man who handled the Quaker Oats account, Ken Mason, asked David L. Wolper if he had any other projects with which they could promote a new candy bar, at which point Mr. Wolper told him about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Ken Mason took the idea for a film based on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to the Quaker Oats Factory. In the meantime, David L. Wolper called Roald Dahl's agent who indicated that they could buy the film rights for $200,000. Fortunately, the Quaker Oats Company indicated that they were indeed interested in financing the film. Quaker Oats Company then began work on a Wonka Bar, and hence the title of the project went from being Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Difficulties in coming up with the formula for the Wonka Bar would result in the Quaker Oats Company giving up on bringing the new candy bar to the market, although they would have success manufacturing other products under the \"Willy Wonka\" name.Director Mel Stuart had initially conceived of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory as a straight-forward drama. The poems sang by the Oompa-Loompas in the novel would have simply been recited in the film. It was producer David L. Wolper who encouraged Mel Stuart to make the movie a musical. The score and songs would be composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, who had earlier written the stage musicals The Roar of the Greasepaint—the Smell of the Crowd and Stop the World – I Want to Get Off.Roald Dahl was meant to write the screenplay for Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, but had difficulty meeting deadlines. As a result David Seltzer did uncredited work on the screenplay, and made some major changes to it. Among the changes Mr. Seltzer made to the screenplay (which were not in the book) were the addition of the character of Slugworth and a scene dealing with fizzy drinks that made one float in the air.vFor the all important role of Willy Wonka, author Roald Dahl's choice was British comedian Spike Milligan. Director Mel Stuart and producers David L. Wolper and Stan Margulies first considered Joel Grey for the role. Of course, the role of Willy Wonka would eventually go to Gene Wilder. At that point Gene Wilder's career was still on the rise. He had a supporting role in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), played a co-lead in The Producers, a co-lead in Start the Revolution Without Me (1970), and a lead in Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx (1971).Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was filmed from August 31 1970 to November 19 1970, largely in Munich, West Germany. While today the film is a beloved family classic, author Roald Dahl disliked the movie and disowned it. He was angered by the fact that much of his script was rewritten by David Seltzer and angered with the changes that were made. He was even angry that music had been added beyond the Oompa-Loompa songs (which differ from the Oompa-Loompa songs in the book). He thought the movie centred too much on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie.Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was not a success upon its initial release, despite receiving good reviews from critics. It only earned $2.1 million on its opening weekend and ultimately it was the 53rd highest grossing film for 1971 in the United States. It would receive some attention the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science in the form of an Oscar nomination for Best Music, Scoring Adaptation and Original Song Score. Fortunately, in the years following its release Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory would become a favourite at children's matinees. In 1974 Gene Wilder would have two hit movies in the form of Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. The network television premiere of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory on NBC on November 23 1975 was then highly anticipated. Unfortunately, in the Eastern and Central time zones the first 45 minutes of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory on NBC was pre-empted by an NFL game between the Oakland Raiders and the Washington Redskins that had gone into over time. As a result NBC received over 1000 irate calls from viewers angry that they had missed the 45 minutes of the movie due to a football game.Fortunately, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory would air many more times on television. In the process it has become one of the most beloved family films of all time. The movie boasts a 90% rating on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. In 2014 it was included in the National Film Registry for being \"...culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" Over the years Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory has regularly been included in lists of the best family movies ever made. While it might not have done well on its initial release, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory has since become a beloved classic.( a lot of the information in this post came from the book Pure Imagination: The Making of Wily Wonka and the Chocolate Factory by Mel Stuart and Joel Young. I highly recommend it!)"},

I know I enjoyed seeing him on The Champions and his many guest appearances. Anyone who has seen the 1965 version of Cinderella knows he had an amazing singing voice.  He was certainly an actor of multiple talents."},
{"title": "Dorothy Arzner, the First Female DGA Member", "date": "Tuesday, June 29, 2021", "text": "Dorothy Arzner occupies an important position in film history. She was the only female director to work within the studio system and one of the few to make a career for herself directing. She was also the first woman to ever direct a talkie. Dorothy Arzner was also the first woman to join the Directors Guild of America. What makes Dorothy Arzner even more unique is that she was an open lesbian at a time when homosexuality was frowned upon.Dorothy Arzner was born in San Francisco, but she grew up in Los Angeles. Her father, Louis Arzner, operated a restaurant that frequented by many of the early Hollywood and theatre elite, including Maude Adams, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and Mack Sennett. She attended the University of Southern California, majoring in medicine, but ultimately decided she did not want to be a doctor. She began her film career in the script department of the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation (which would evolve into Paramount). She moved from the script department to working as a cutter and editor at Realart Studio, a division of Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. She received her big break when she served as the editor on Blood and Sand (1922).Dorothy Arzner became respected enough for her work as both an editor and screenwriter that eventually Columbia Pictures made an offer to her to write and direct a movie. Ms. Arzner used Columbia's offer as leverage with Paramount so that she could direct a major feature film. Fashions for Women (1927) would be the first feature film ever directed by Dorothy Arzner. Sadly, it is also lost.Dorothy Arzner directed the silent movies Fashions for Women, Ten Modern Commandments (1927), Get Your Man (1927), and Manhattan Cocktail (1928) before directing the Clara Bow vehicle The Wild Party (1929). The Wild Party would be historic for a number of reasons. It is not only the first talkie to star Clara Bow, but the first talkie directed by a woman and the first talkie ever produced by Paramount. On The Wild Party Dorothy Arzner also made an innovation to filmmaking. Clara Bow was not particularly comfortable with microphones, so Ms. Arzner attached a microphone to the end of a fishing pole so Clara Bow could move around. Quite simply, it was one of the earliest boom mics (previously, for Beggars of Life William Wellman had attached a microphone to the end of a broom). The Wild Party was the beginning of the peak of Dorothy Arzner's career. For Paramount she directed such popular films as Sarah and Son (1929), Honor Among Lovers (1931), and Merrily We Go to Hell (1932). She went freelance in 1932 and continued to make several popular films, including Christopher Strong (1933), Craig's Wife (1936), Dance, Girl Dance (1940). She worked with some legendary leading ladies, including Claudette Colbert, Katharine Hepburn, Rosalind Russell, Lucille Ball, and Maureen O'Hara. As a freelancer she made films for such studios as RKO, United Artists, Columbia, and MGM.Dorothy Arzner retired from Hollywood in 1943, although she made training films for the Women's Army Corps during World War II and later produced the radio show You Were Meant to Be a Star. She worked with the Pasadena Playhouse and taught film at UCLA.While Dorothy Arzner was not a particularly public person, she was openly a lesbian, as mentioned earlier. She had a relationship with dancer and choreographer Marion Morgan that lasted forty years. It also been claimed that she had relationships with various actresses, including Alla Nazimova and Billie Burke. Ms. Arzner was never in the closet and she never hid the fact that she was a lesbian.A good deal has been written about Dorothy Arzner, from both feminist and queer perspectives, but even after casually viewing her films it is clear that Ms. Arzner's movies differed a good deal from her contemporaries. More so than movies made by her male contemporaries, Dorothy Arzner's films place an emphasis on relationships between women. This can be seen in The Wild Party, in which the relationships between students at an all-female college are explored. Dance, Girl, Dance centred upon the relationships between various dancers. Ms. Arzner's portrayal of female camaraderie was made all the more realistic in that her female characters were all four-dimensional. These were women who could actually exist rather than the usual Hollywood caricatures.Dorothy Arzner's portrayal of romances and marriages also differed from those of other filmmakers of her period. This can be seen in Merrily We Go to Hell, in which Jerry Corbett (Fredric March) and Joan Prentice (Sylvia Sydney) have what would today be called an \"open marriage.\" Honor Among Lovers features a romance that does not go quite as viewers might expect it to. Craig's Wife portrays a traditional marriage as outright repressive. Even in the Pre-Code Era, heteronormative marriage was often held to be sacrosanct. Dorothy Arzner's movies often took another view.Dorothy Arzner was a true pioneer. She was the only female director working in Hollywood throughout the Thirties.Her films were strikingly different from other films made at the time. There is little way one can mistake a movie made by Dorothy Arzner for a movie by another director. She was also very successful. Dorothy Arzner was ultimately a extremely talented woman with real insight into human nature."},

{"title": "Vanessa Marquez on Culture Clash", "date": "Saturday, June 26, 2021", "text": "One of the most overlooked aspects of the career of Vanessa Marquez was that she was a regular on Culture Clash in 1993. For those of you unfamiliar with the TV show Culture Clash, it was a TV show that aired on stations of the Fox Television Network, starring the legendary Chicano comedy troupe of that name. Vanessa really enjoyed her time on Culture Clash, and Culture Clash appreciated her as well. Indeed, since her death Culture Clash has taken part in events to get justice for Vanessa. Culture Clash certainly allowed Vanessa Marquez to display her considerable talent. She played everything from a little girl reciting poetry to an extremely intelligent game show contestant to a  sexy pizza delivery woman. She particularly shines in the sketch \"West Side Story...35 Years Later,\" which gave her a chance to show off her considerable talent as a singer (Vanessa had a beautiful singing voice).  Vanessa loved playing in that sketch, as West Side Story was her second favourite musical (after The Wizard of Oz). Vanessa had uploaded a collection of clips featuring her to her YouTube channel in 2009. Just a few days ago the YouTube account \"Clasterfan\" uploaded another collection of Culture Clash sketches featuring Vanessa (I want to thank LJF Productions for alerting me to this on Twitter). Here then are Vanessa's collection of clips from Culture Clash  starring her and Clasterfan's collection of clips from Culture Clash starring her as well. \"West Side Story...35 Years Later\" appears in both videos. Anyhow, while I am obviously biased, I think you will agree with me that Vanessa had a real gift for comedy."},

{"title": "William Haines and Jimmie Shields: The Happiest Marriage in Hollywood", "date": "Thursday, June 24, 2021", "text": "Today Williams Haines is not a well-known name, but in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he was one of the best known movie stars. He appeared in such movies as Brown of Harvard (1926), Alias Jimmy Valentine (1928), and A Tailor Made Man (1931). He topped the  Quigley Poll, a survey of film exhibitors in 1930 and ranked in the top five box office stars from 1928 to 1932. It was in 1933 that he walked away from his career and never acted again.William Haines was working as a male model when he was discovered through \"New Faces of 1922\" contest conducted by Goldwyn Pictures.  He was signed to a $40 a week contract by Goldwyn Pictures. While he had a substantial role in Three Wise Fools (1923), for the most part Mr. Haines found himself stuck in minor roles at Goldwyn Pictures. His next significant role would only come when he was lent to Fox for The Desert Outlaw (1923).It was in 1924 that Loew's Theatres incorporated acquired Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures, and Louis B. Mayer Pictures and merged the three studios to form MGM. That same year MGM lent William Haines to Columbia for a five picture deal. Columbia was impressed enough by Mr. Haines to make an offer to buy his contract, but MGM refused. William Haines's fortunes at MGM would change. He played a significant role in Little Annie Rooney (1925), starring Mary Pickford. In 1926 he would have another significant role in Brown of Harvard (1926). In fact, Brown of Harvard would establish the course of the rest of his career. It was the first time he would play the type of role for which he was best known, that of the wisecracking, arrogant, young man.Nineteen twenty-six would prove to be an important year for William Haines in another, perhaps even more important way. It was that year while he made a publicity trip to New York City. While there he met Jimmie Shields. William Haines convinced Jimmie Shields to return with him to Hollywood with the hope of getting work as an extra. The two fell in love and began living together. Although they were clearly committed to each other, the press on the time did not remark on their relationship.In the meantime, William Haines's career continued to rise. He starred in West Point (1928) and later appeared in The Smart Set (1928). He played opposite Marion Davies in Show People (1928). William Haines successfully made the transition to talkies. His first partially talking film was Alias Jimmie Valentine, which proved to be a success. His first entirely talking film was Navy Blues (1929). Over the next few years he found success in such films as Way Out West (1930), A Tailor Made Man (1931), New Adventures of Get Rich Quick Wallingford (1931), and Are You Listening (1932). Unfortunately, as William Haines's career continued to prosper, Hollywood was changing. Virginia Rappe's death in 1921 (of which Roscoe Arbuckle was accused), the murder of William Desmond Taylor, and various other scandals had convinced some across the country that Hollywood was a place of sin and decadence. At the same time, there were those who were growing concerned about the content of movies made at the time. In 1934 the Catholic Legion of Decency, later renamed the National Legion of Decency, was organized in order to identify objectionable material in motion pictures for Catholics. Other religious groups and moral watchdogs also expressed concern over the content of movies being made at the time. Ultimately, the outcry would result in stricter enforcement of the Production Code, bringing the Pre-Code Era to an end in 1934.Sadly, the moral panic over the content of motion pictures would even have an impact on the personal lives of stars. At the time homosexuality was considered to be immoral. It then in 1933 that Louis B. Mayer gave William Haines a choice. Mr. Haines could continue his career if he entered a lavender marriage, a marriage with a member of the opposite sex meant to conceal the sexual orientation of one or both people involved. If Mr. Haines continued his relationship with Jimmie Shields, then his acting career was over. William Haines chose Jimmie Shields, to whom he regarded himself as being married.William Haines would appear in Mascot Pictures' Young and Beautiful (1934) and The Marines Are Coming (1934) before giving up acting entirely. William Haines and Jimmie Shields then opened their own interior design firm, at which they proved to be very successful. They worked for such clients as Joan Crawford, Carole Lombard, Marion Davies, George Cuckor, Jack Warner, and Ronald Reagan. So successful was William Haines Designs that the company continues to exist to this day.Ultimately, William Haines and Jimmie Shields remained together for 47 years, outlasting many other Hollywood unions. Joan Crawford called Messrs. Haines and Shields's relationship, \"the happiest marriage in Hollywood.\" William Haines died on December 26 1973 at the age of 73 from lung cancer. Jimmie Shields was overcome by grief. It was on March 6 1974 that he took an overdose of sleeping pills, leaving behind a note, \"Goodbye to all of you who have tried so hard to comfort me in my loss of William Haines, whom I have been with since 1926. I now find it impossible to go it alone, I am much too lonely.\"William Haines and Jimmie Shields were openly gay at a time when it was dangerous to be so. Furthermore, William Haines refused to compromise himself simply to continue his career. Being openly gay was an enormous act of courage at the time. Refusing to give up his relationship in some ways even more so. William Haines was truly a pioneer, and many years ahead of his time."},

While many people think of Hollywood when they think of classic movies, the fact is that the United Kingdom made many significant contributions to film over the years. From the Gainsborough melodramas to Hammer Films to the British New Wave, cinema would be much poorer without the British.Here are the ground rules for this year's blogathon:1. Posts can be about any British film or any topic related to British films. For the sake of simplicity, I am using \"British\" here to refer to any film made by a company based in the United Kingdom or British Crown dependencies. If you want to write about a film made in Northern Ireland or the Isle of Man, then, you can do so. Also for the sake of simplicity, people can write about co-productions made with companies from outside the United Kingdom. For example, since 2001: A Space Odyssey is a British-American co-production, someone could write about it if they chose.2. There is no limit on subject matter. You can write about any film in any genre you want. Posts can be on everything from the British New Wave to the Gainsborough bodice rippers to the Hammer Horrors. I am also making no limit on the format posts can take. You could review a classic British film, make an in-depth analysis of a series of British films, or even simply do a pictorial tribute to a film. That having been said, since this is a classic film blogathon,  I only ask that you write about films made before 2011. I generally don't think of a film as a classic until it has been around for thirty years, but to give bloggers more options I am setting the cut off point at ten years ago.3. I am asking that there please be no duplicates. That having been said, if someone has already chosen to cover From Russia with Love (1963), someone else could write about the James Bond series as a whole.4. I am not going to schedule days for individual posts.

{"title": "Happy Juneteenth 2021", "date": "Saturday, June 19, 2021", "text": "Juneteenth FlagI want to wish everyone a happy Juneteenth, which this week officially became a Federal holiday in the United States. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Juneteenth, the holiday is rooted in events following the end of the Civil War. It was on September 22 1862 that President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in the Confederacy. As might be expected, enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation relied on the advancement of Union troops. As Texas was the most remote states of the Confederacy and had only a few Union troops there, it was not until June 19 1865, a little over two months after Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomatax, that slaves were freed in Galveston, Texas.On June 19 1865 Major General Gordon Granger of the Union Army arrived in Galveston, Texas. He read General Order No. 3, the order freeing the slaves, first at Union Army Headquarters at the Osterman Building and then at the 1861 Customs House and Courthouse and the Negro Church (now Reedy Chapel-AME Church). While slaves throughout the states that had formed the Confederacy were now free, slavery still existed in the United States in two border states that had not seceded from the Union, Kentucky and Delaware. The slaves in those states would not be freed until December 18 1865 upon the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States.Regardless, Juneteenth became a holiday almost immediately. One year after the slaves in Galveston were freed, on June 19 1866, freedmen in Texas celebrated was called \"Jubilee Day.\" Over the years its name would vary. In 1874 the The Austin Statesman referred to it as \"Emancipation Day.\" The same newspaper called it an \"Emancipation Celebration\" in 1875. \"Juneteenth\" itself is a blend of \"June\" and \"Nineteenth,\" and was likely in use before it first appeared in print. It first appeared in print in 1890, when the Black newspaper The Beaumont Recorder referred to the holiday as \"Juneteenth.\" The Gavelston Daily News quoted The Beaumont Recorder that year (for more information on how Juneteenth got its name, I recommend you read Ben Zimmer's article in The Wall Street Journal, \"How the 'Juneteenth' Name--and Holiday--Spread.\"Juneteenth received official recognition rather early. In 1938 then Governor of Texas James V. Allred issued a proclamation proclaiming June 19 as \"Emancipation Day.\" As Blacks from Texas moved elsewhere during the period of the Great Migration, celebration of Juneteenth spread throughout the United States, to places as far away as Los Angeles and San Francisco. It was in the 1970s that the Texas legislature declared Juneteenth a \"holiday of significance.\" Since then it has been recognized by other states. It was in 1996 that legislation to recognize Juneteenth as a Federal holiday was first introduced into the United States House of Representatives.As Juneteenth spread throughout the United States, so too did its impact on popular culture. Ralph Ellison's novel Juneteenth was published in 1999. In 2016 the TV show Atlanta featured an episode centred on the holiday entitled \"Juneteenth.\" The following year the sitcom Black-ish also aired an episode about the holiday entitled \"Juneteenth.\" Last year, the movie Miss Juneteenth, about an young woman who enters the local \"Miss Juneteenth\" pageant, was released. Last night, ABC aired a special Juneteenth episode of their documentary series Soul of a Nation.Much of the credit for Juneteenth becoming a Federal holiday must be given to Opal Lee, often described as \"the Grandmother of Juneteenth.\" An educator in Texas, she began her campaign to have Juneteenth decades ago. Her goal was quite simply to bring Juneteenth to the rest of the nation. She began walking 2 1/2 miles each year on Juneteenth, 2 1/2 miles for the 2 1/2 years between the Emancipation Proclamation and the emancipation of the slaves in Galveston. Eventually she would be invited to Juneteenth celebrations in such diverse cities as Shreveport, Louisiana; Texarkana; Madison, Wisconsin; Milawaukee; Atlanta; and yet others.For me Juneteenth is a welcome addition to our Federal holidays. When my brother lived in Texas he told me about the history of Juneteenth and the celebrations there. Unlike some of our Federal holidays, Juneteenth has real meaning to it and it celebrates an important event in our history. For me Juneteenth is not just a significant day for the Black community, but for all Americans."},
{"title": "Godspeed Frank Bonner", "date": "Friday, June 18, 2021", "text": "Frank Bonner, best known for playing Herb Tarlek on the classic sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati, died yesterday at the age of 79. The cause was complications from Lewy body dementia. Mr. Bonner also directed several television shows over the years.Frank Bonner was born Frank Woodrow Boers Jr. on February 28 1942 in Little Rock, Arkansas. He grew up in Malvern, Arkansas. He served in the United States Navy for six years. In 1967 he made his film debut in the film Equinox...A Journey into the Supernatural. In 1970 additional footage was shot for the film and it was re-edited to become the cult film Equinox. Frank Bonner made his television debut in 1970 in an episode of The Young Lawyers. That same year he guest starred on an episode of Nancy.It was in 1978 that Frank Bonner began playing the role of Herb Tarlek on WKRP in Cincinnati. Herb Tarlek was WRKP's long-time sales manager with terrible taste in clothing and who was somewhat inept at his job. During the Seventies Frank Bonner guest starred on the TV shows Mannix; Nichols; The F.B.I.; Hawkins; Emergency!; Love, American Style; Cannon; Police Woman; Most Wanted; and Man from Atlantis. It was while he was still on WKRP in Cincinnati that he began directing television shows, directing an episode of the show in 1980. Mr. Bonner ultimately directed six episodes of WKRP in Cincinnati in total. He appeared in the movies The Hoax (1972), Little Cigars (1973), Las Vegas Lady (1975),  and Hearts of the West (1975).In the Eighties Frank Bonner played the recurring roles of Henry \"Buck\" McConnell on Scarecrow and Mrs. King, Det. R.T. Mooney on Sidekicks, and Father Robert Hargis on Just the Ten of Us. He guest starred on the shows Fantasy Island; The Love Boat; Newhart; Legmen; The Duck Factory; Simon & Simon; Matt Houston; Gimme a Break!; Crazy Like a Fox; New Love, American Style; Punky Brewster; Blacke's Magic; Murder, She Wrote; and Night Court. He directed episodes of Family Ties, Frank's Place, The Van Dyke Show, Who's the Boss, Just the Ten of Us, Head of the Class, Evening Shade, You Take the Kids, and The Famous Teddy Z. He appeared in the movies The Longshot (1986) and You Can't Hurry Love (1988).In 1991 Frank Bonner revisited the role of Herb Tarlek in the TV show revival The New WKRP in Cincinnati. He played Mr. Ed Harrington in Saved by The Bell: The New Class. He guest starred on The Mommies, The Colony, and City Guys. He directed episodes of Harry and the Henderson, The New WKRP in Cincinnati, Fudge, The Mommies, Campus Cops, Saved by the Bell: The New Class, USA High, and City Guys. He appeared in the movies Going Under (1991) and Motel (1998). In the Naughts he directed the TV movie Living Straight and directed an episode of the TV show Desire and Deceit. He appeared in the movies A Light in the Forest (2003), Shut Up and Kiss Me! (2004), and Remembering Phil (2008). In the Teens he appeared in the movie Under the Hollywood Sign (2014).As Herb Tarlek, Frank Bonner created one of television's most memorable characters. While Herb is the epitome of the unprofessional, incompetent salesman, he also complex enough a character that he showed real concern for his fellow employees at WKRP, even when they didn't always get along. Of course, Frank Bonner played recurring characters on other shows (Scarecrow and Mrs King, Sidekicks, and Just the Ten of Us) and guest starred on many more. Furthermore, he directed several episodes of TV shows, starting with WKRP in Cincinnati. As beloved as he as an actor, Frank Bonner actually preferred his work as a director. Regardless, Mr. Bonner was an extremely talented actor and director who created one of the most memorable characters in television history."},
{"title": "The Flip Wilson Show", "date": "Thursday, June 17, 2021", "text": "Recently the second sequel to The Conjuring was released. It was titled The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. What many members of Generation Z may not know is that the phrase \"The Devil made me do it\" did not originate with the producers of the Conjuring movies or even their screenwriters. Instead, \"The Devil made me do it\" originated with comedian Flip Wilson. It was one of the catchphrases of his character Geraldine. While only individuals of a certain age remember The Flip Wilson Show today, in the early Seventies it was wildly successful, coming in at no. 2 in the Nielsen ratings for its first two seasons. While other African Americans had hosted variety shows prior to Flip Wilson, arguably his was the first to be successful.Flip Wilson began his career in the late Fifties, touring what was then known as \"the Chitlin' Circuit.\" His career really began to take off in 1965 after Redd Foxx, when asked by Johnny Carson whom the funniest current comedian was, replied \"Flip Wilson.\" Flip Wilson was booked on The Tonight Show and appeared on the show several more times, as well as appearing on such shows as The Kraft Music Hall, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Joey Bishop Show, Laugh-In, and The Carol Burnett Show.In 1969 Flip Wilson hosted his own special on NBC, The Flip Wilson Special. It was on the special that he introduced his popular character Geraldine Jones. Unlike earlier female characters played by male characters, Flip Wilson did not mean to belittle women with Geraldine, but instead create a character who was strong, proud, and who spoke her own mind. Flip Wilson also had success with comedy records. His 1967 album Cowboys and Colored People proved to be a hit, as did his 1970 album The Devil Made Me Buy This Dress.  The latter album centred on the character of Geraldine.The success of The Flip Wilson Special in 1969, as well as Flip Wilson's albums, led directly to The Flip Wilson Show. From the beginning The Flip Wilson Show differed from other variety shows with regards to its stage. Its stage was a circular platform around which the audience were seated (with some even behind sets at times), essentially a theatre-in-the-round. As might be expected, The Flip Wilson Show also featured top African American performers on a regular basis, including Louis Armstrong, James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Lena Horne, The Jackson Five, Gladys Knight & The Pips, The Pointer Sisters, The Supremes, and The Temptations. Other top singers featured on the show were Pat Boone, Johnny Cash, Roy Clark,  Bobby Darin, Dean Martin, Roger Miller, The Osmonds, and Sha Na Na. Several other top performers were featured on The Flip Wilson Show, including Lucille Ball, George Carlin, Art Carney, Tim Conway, Phyllis Diller, Sandy Duncan, Marty Feldman, Redd Foxx, Andy Griffith, Don Knotts, The Muppets, Carl Reiner, Lily Tomlin, and many others.Of course, regardless of who the guest star of the week was, much of the attraction of The Flip Wilson Show were the sketches featuring his various characters. Geraldine appeared frequently, and the success of the show led to her catchphrases, \"The Devil made me do it,\" \"When you're hot, you're hot,\" and \"What you see is what you get\" appearing on t-shirts, pinback buttons, and magnets. Another character on the show was Reverend Leroy, the pastor of the Church of What's Happening Now! It was always strong hinted that Reverend Leroy was a con man. Another character was swinging bachelor Freddie Johnson. Freddie's sketches often saw him on a date with one of the guest stars of that week. Among the women with whom he sought dates were Lola Falana and Denise Nicholas. Other characters were blue collar worker Marvin Lattimer and White House janitor Sonny.Much of the success of The Flip Wilson Show can be credited to its writers, which included Flip Wilson himself. Stan Burns was a veteran of The Steve Allen Show and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. Hal Goodman has worked on The Red Skelton Show and The Carol Burnett Show. Bill Schiller's credits included I Love Lucy, The Red Skelton Show, and The Lucy Show (which he had developed). Ultimately, there are too many writers who worked on The Flip Wilson Show to be listed briefly, although many of them had worked on some very well-known shows. Flip Wilson himself wrote about a third of the material. He also edited much of the other writers' work.The Flip Wilson Show proved wildly successful upon its debut on September 17 1970 on NBC. For the 1970-1971 season it ranked no. 2. It also ranked no. 2 for the 1971-1972 season. Unfortunately, in the 1972-1973 season CBS scheduled The Waltons opposite The Flip Wilson Show. Initially The Waltons was low rated, but CBS mounted a promotional campaign that helped the show immensely. Ultimately, The Flip Wilson Show dropped to no. 12 for the year, while The Waltons ranked no. 19. As to their competition on ABC, The Mod Squad was cancelled at the end of the season. Unfortunately for The Flip Wilson Show, the audience for The Waltons continued to grow. For the 1973-1974 season, The Flip Wilson Show dropped to no. 50 for the year, while The Waltons came in at no. 2. Flip Wilson elected to end the show rather than continue.During the run of The Flip Wilson Show, Flip Wilson also appeared in two animated specials based on himself and his characters. The first was Clewrow Wilson and the Miracle of P.S. 14 (Clerow Wilson was Flip Wilson's given name), which aired on November 12 1972. It featured Geraldine, Reverend Leroy, and Freddie Johnson. The second special was Clerow Wilson's Great Escape, which aired on April 3 1974. It featured Geraldine Jones and Reverend Leroy.While it only lasted four years, The Flip Wilson Show would have an impact. Its catchphrases have persisted in the English language ever since, long after the show went off the air. Geraldine's catchphrase \"What you see is what you get\" would be abbreviated as WWSIWYG by computer programmers to refer to any editing software in which what one sees on the screen will be what it will look like when printed. \"The Devil made me do it\" has been used as the title of TV show episodes, music albums, and now even the subtitle of a movie. An argument can be made that The Flip Wilson Show would have an impact on future sketch comedy shows, from Saturday Night Live (which Flip Wilson would guest host in 1983) to In Living Color. While today's generation may not remember The Flip Wilson Show, it continues to have an influence on popular culture."},
{"title": "Experiencing Technical Difficulties ", "date": "Wednesday, June 16, 2021", "text": "I  was planning to make a blog post today, but right now I really don't feel like it.  A few days ago my brother contracted a summertime cold and I caught it from him. The past couple of days then I have been blowing my nose and coughing my head off. For those of you who may be concerned it could be COVID-19, I was fully inoculated two months ago, so odds are against that. At any rate, I have been perfectly miserable. Like Miss Kubelik in The Apartment, I almost never catch colds. In fact, the last severe cold I had was in December 2008. Anyway, I hope to be back with a post tomorrow on The Flip Wilson Show."},

He was the voice of the Mayor in Rango (2011).Ned Beatty was an incredible actor who leaves behind a legacy of great performances. His speech as die-hard capitalist and chairman of CAA, Arthur Jensen, in Network, remains one of the most remarkable speeches in movie history. There should be little wonder why he was nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for the role. While the real life Martin Dardis disliked how he was played in the movie, Ned Beatty's performance as Mr. Dardis in All the President's Men remains impressive. Ned Beatty could easily play a buffoon, such as Otis in Superman  and Superman II, but he was also capable of much more serious roles. As Sheriff Connors in White Lightning he was the heavy and about as far from comic relief as one could get.While he may be best known for his work in movies, Ned Beatty was also impressive on television. As Detective Stanley Bolander on Homicide: Life on the Street, he played a character who could be gruff, but also capable of being gentle and kind as well. He did an impressive job of playing Judge Roy Bean in the mini-series Streets of Laredo. Ned Beatty was an incredible actor and he always gave great performances."},
{"title": "Ten Years Without Brian", "date": "Saturday, June 12, 2021", "text": "It is one of the sad facts of my life that each of my best friends died young. My best friend in college, Ron, died in a car crash when he was only 22. And, of course, I have discussed many times here the death of my dearest Vanessa. Today it is the tenth anniversary of the death of my friend Brian Stephenson. He died on this date when the nursing home at which he was recovering administered too much insulin.I knew Brian for well over 25 years. We met when we were in our twenties through mutual friends, all of who played role playing games. Brian and I naturally gravitated to each other. We shared many interests beyond role playing games, including classic movies, classic television, comic books, pulp magazines, and science fiction. We rarely argued and when we did so, we never remained angry at each other for long. We watched many movies together. It was with Brian that I first saw Seven Samurai (1954), La Dolce Vita (1960), The Big Sleep (1946), and many others. We almost always went to the theatre together. We had an arrangement where we rotated who paid our way in (when we were younger, at least, it was not unusual for one of us to be broke). If I haven't gone to the movie theatre much in the past ten years, it is because it doesn't feel right without Brian there. We read many of the same books and comic books. Any time one of us bought a book, he would let the other one of us read it when he was through reading it. In many ways, Brian was much more like a brother or cousin than he was simply a friend.Brian was very talented. He wrote a screen play and also wrote several short stories. Sadly, he never tried to get anything published. He was also a math whiz, able to add and subtract, multiply and divide in his head. That came in handy, as I need a calculator simply to add and subtract! If I had some math to do and didn't have a calculator, I simply looked to Brian. Among Brian's few flaws, it was that he was technologically challenged. That might sound surprising to some, as I tend to be fairly comfortable with technology. Anyway, either my brother or I had to install every one of Brian's VCRS. I set up every computer he ever owned, and installed the printers on those computers as well. A more important flaw on Brian's part is that he did not take particularly good care of himself. He was diabetic and it was not unusual for him to try to do without his insulin when he was low on money. Sadly, it was that flaw that eventually cost him his life. His health failed, he was put in a nursing home to recover, and then they administered too much insulin.To this day I miss Brian terribly. Even ten years later it feels as if I should call him any time I see a movie or TV show I particularly like. I hate not being able to visit him and being able to go to the theatre with him. Aside from close family and Vanessa, I was never closer to anyone than I was Brian. I have often compared us to Charters and Caldicott, the primary difference being that we were obsessed with pop culture instead of cricket. I imagine either Charters or Caldicott would feel as lost without the other as I have without Brian."},

The reunion was organized by Latino Slant and co-sponsored by The Daily Chela and Midnight's Edge. The reunion included Edward James Olmos, Lou Diamond Philips, and most of the actors who played students (Karla Montana was absent). The event helped raise money for the Latino Theatre Company in Los Angeles.As might be expected, watching the reunion was emotional for me. Before the reunion took place they played a memorial video for my beloved Vanessa Marquez (who played Ana Delgado in the film), so I spent several minutes crying. In the superchat many also made donations in Vanessa's memory. The reunion itself was enjoyable to watch, as I expected it to be (in 2019 at the screening of Stand and Deliver at the LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes I had seen a panel of the cast). Sadly, Patrick Baca was having technical difficulties and as a result didn't really get to take part much in the panel. That made me a bit sad, as Patrick is a great raconteur. At one point one of Lou Diamond Philips's cats decided to \"meow.\" I was really hoping that maybe the kitty would make an appearance on screen, but they didn't. Anyway, I know that while Vanessa wasn't there physically, she was there in spirit.I do have to point out that Paulie of Latino Slant did mispronounce my name. For those of you who are wondering \"Towles\" is pronounced with a long \"o\" (like \"tolls\") and in \"Canote\" the \"o\" is long and the \"e\" is silent.  Here I want to say that I didn't mind Paulie mispronouncing my name, as I am used to it. I felt lucky just to have been acknowledged!I have embedded the video here if you want to watch it. You can also watch it at the Midnight's Edge YouTube channel."},

That having been said, he could play a wide array of characters, from The Kid's abusive father in Purple Rain to the black power leader Kalina in I'm Goona Get You Sucka. Indeed, while Clarence Williams III may be best known for The Mod Squad, he was a adept at comedy as he was drama. He was a very versatile actor."},

{"title": "The 17th Anniversary of A Shroud of Thoughts", "date": "Friday, June 4, 2021", "text": "It was 17 years ago that I first started writing this blog, A Shroud of Thoughts. In the early to mid-Naughts, blogs were a bit of fad, and a lot of people were launching their own. In fact, it was a lady friend with her own blog who inspired me to launch A Shroud of Thoughts. It looked fun, so I decided to try my own. I have writen A Shroud of Thoughts longer than any jobs I have had, so it has become my life's work after a fashion. In the mid-Naughts it was fashionable for blogs to have titles containing the word \"thoughts\" or synonyms thereof. I then took the phrase \"A Shroud of Thoughts\" from Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage canto iii stanza 113 (I won't quote here, as over the years I think I have quoted it enough). Given A Shroud of Thoughts has always been devoted to pop culture and nostalgia, if I had to do it all over again I would have chosen a more appropriate title. a name more fitting for a blog dedicated to pop culture and nostalgia. Had I known about the word retrophilia at the time (which Collins Dictionary defines as \"a strong liking for things from the past\"), I probably would have named it that instead. At any rate, by the time it occurred to me that the blog should have a better name, it already had a following. A Shroud of Thoughts it has then remained.Of course, A Shroud of Thoughts is not the only blog that has been around for awhile.  Immortal Ephemera is older than this blog, dating to 2002. Inner Toob is about a month and a half older, starting in April 2004. Both The Stop Button and Laura's Miscellaneous Musings go back to 2005. The Rap Sheet dates to 2006. My friend Raquel started Out of the Past in 2007.  Blogs older than a decade are rare, but they are not as rare as some might think!  By the way, I strongly recommend that you visit all of these fine blogs (they've lasted so long for a reason).Sadly, the past year has not been a particularly good one for A Shroud of Thoughts. Not counting 2004 (which was only half a year), 2020 boasted far fewer posts than any other year. Some might think that it was because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but that actually had a minimal impact on my emotional state and my desire to write. What fouled my mood for much of last year was the Los Angeles District Attorney Office's report on Vanessa's death released in March (curiously, the day before the Los Angeles District Attorney election). As anyone who knows me or who reads this blog knows, I was (and still am) both angered and disappointed by the report (if you are wondering why, read my post \"Justice for Vanessa Marquez\" listed below) and it affected my mood for the rest of the year. A writer's tools are their mind and their heart, and if those fail them, they can't write.One problem I have faced the past year is the sheer number of celebrities who have died. It seems as if the year 2020 and now the year 2021 has seen more famous actors, musicians, writers, et. al. die than usual. As I like to eulogize those artists who have had an impact on me, this has meant I have been writing more eulogies than usual on the blog, so much so that some weeks on the blog are nothing but euologies. Of course, this means I have less time to devote to posts on other topics. I fear we have reached a point in history where every week is going to see the death of some beloved movie star, TV star, or musician.Anyway, it is my custom at A Shroud of Thoughts to list my favourite blog posts from the past year each anniversary. Because I wrote fewer posts last year, I also have fewer favourites listed this year. \"Dimension X,\" July 8 2020\"Justice for Vanessa Marquez,\" July 30 2020\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show Turns 50,\" September 19 2020\"The TV Show The Odd Couple Turns 50,\" September 24 2020\"The 60th Anniversary of the TV Show Route 66,\" October 7 2020\"The Paul Lynde Halloween Special,\" October 27 2020\"Department Stores at Christmas,' December 18 2020\"The 52nd Birthday of Vanessa Marquez,\" December 21 2020\"The 80th Anniversary of Captain America,\" January 2021 \"Sounds of the City,\" February 19 2021\"Joan Collins in 'The City on the Edge of Forever',\" March 9 2021\"The Wild Wild West, 'The Night of the Murderous Spring,'\" March 20 2021 \"The 20th Anniversary of the BET Television Movie Fire & Ice,\" April 7 2021\"An Appointment with The Wicker Man (1974),\" May 21 2021\"Mayberry, Everyone's Hometown,\" May 22 2021\"Nancy Kwan, More Than Suzie Wong,\" May 25 2021\"Anna May Wong on Television,\" May 28 2021"},

The cause was complications from pneumonia. He had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2013.Robert Hogan was born on September 28 1933 in New York City. During the Korean War he served in the United States Army. Afterwards he began studying engineering at New York University, but an aptitude test he took during his first semester suggested he would be suited to a career in the arts. As a result, he decided to try acting. He enrolled in the  American Academy of Dramatic Art. In 1961 he made his off-Broadway debut in Call Me by My Rightful Name.That same year he made his television debut in the show True Story. In the Sixties he had recurring roles on the daytime soap operas The Young Marrieds and Bright Promises. He had a regular role on Peyton Place. He guest starred on Cheyenne, Hawaiian Eye, Bronco, 77 Sunset Strip, Fair Exchange, Hazel, The Donna Reed Show, The Twilight Zone, Arrest and Trial, The Fugitive, Gomer Pyle: U.S.M.C., Kraft Suspense Theatre, Dr. Kildare, Wendy and Me, 12 O' Clock High, Batman, Bonanza, I Dream of Jeannie, Land of the Giants, Hogan's Heroes, Dan August, and Days of Our Lives.

Bernard Fein named the lead character on a show he co-created, Hogan's Heroes, after him.I have to suspect that the average viewer might not recognize Robert Hogan's name, but they would certainly recognize his face. He was very prolific, appearing in well over 100 shows throughout his long career. What is more, he had recurring roles on several shows. If Robert Hogan was so prolific, it was perhaps because he was so very versatile. On Peyton Place he was one of the title town's ministers. He played military officers multiple times, most notably Lt. Commander Haller on Operation Petticoat. He was a judge on Law & Order. Throughout his career he played lawyers, medical doctors, law enforcement officers, and even con men. He was Sheriff Paul Tate on The Manhunter and retired shipwright Louis Sobotka on The Wire. Robert Hogan was convincing in every role he played and always gave a good performance."},

When she proved unavailable for the follow-up album, When You're in Love, the Whole World is Jewish, Miss Golonka suggested her roommate, Valerie Harper. Arlene Golonka will probably always be remembered best as Millie on Mayberry R.F.D. and the many other bubbly, quirky blondes she played over the years. And while Miss Golonka will most likely be remembered best for her work in comedy, she did play other sorts of roles. She played a prostitute in the movie Hang 'Em High and the \"other woman\" in an affair with a married man in an episode of In the Heat of the Night. In the Cannon episode \"The Dead Samaritan\" she played a none-too-success, aspiring actress. Certainly, Arlene Golonka had a gift for comedy, but she was also at home with more serious material as well."},

In his autobiography, This Is Your Captain Speaking: My Fantastic Voyage Through Hollywood, Faith and Life, he wrote, \"Murray represented all the brown-baggers — not just in newsrooms, but in all sorts of professions.\" And he was certainly right about Murray. He was the sort of talented individual who worked day in and day out, the head writer of WJM-TV and Mary Richards's best friend and ally at the office. As Captain Stubing on The Love Boat he created a character who was congenial, but who could be stern when he had to be. He had previously demonstrated his talent in various guest appearances. On the Andy Griffith Show episode \"The Taylors Go to Hollywood,\" he played actor Bryan Bender, who is playing Andy Taylor is a somewhat exaggerated movie based on Andy's life. He had earlier played Gilbert Jamel, a bank robber posing as a television producer, in the episode \"TV or Not TV.\" And while Gavin MacLeod was well known for his work in comedy, he could do drama as well. In the first two episodes of Hawaii Five-O he played, of all things, a drug pusher named Big Chicken. He appeared on Perry Mason no less than three times.

{"title": "Anna May Wong on Television", "date": "Friday, May 28, 2021", "text": "Anna May Wong was the first major Chinese American star and the first major star of East Asian descent besides Sessue Hayakwa. In fact, from the Silent Era into the early Thirties she was a superstar, easily one of the best known actors in Hollywood. Sadly, Anna May Wong's career would be hindered by California's laws against interracial marriage (on screen she could not kiss an actor of another race), as well as the fact that most East Asian female characters in Hollywood movies at the time tended to be stereotypes. As a result Miss Wong could not maintain the level of success she had in her early career. That having been said, with the advent of television, Anna May Wong was still well known. This made it inevitable that she would appear on the new medium.Indeed, Anna May Wong's television debut would be as the star of her own show. The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong (Miss Wong's birth name). On The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, Anna May Wong played a dealer in Chinese art who would often find herself involved in international intrigue and solving crimes. The DuMont Television Network aired ten episodes of the show from August 27 1951 to November 21 1951. The show was cancelled in 1952. That having been said, The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong made television history. Not only was Anna May Wong one of the first female leads on American television, paving the way for characters from Honey West to Jessica Fletcher, but she was the first Chinese American lead and the first lead of East Asian descent on American television. Unfortunately, The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong no longer exists. Many of the DuMont Television Network's kinescopes were destroyed prior to 1958 to retrieve the silver content in the film prints. Those that remained were dumped into the Upper New York Bay in the mid-Seventies.Her next appearance on television was on the show Producer's Showcase in the episode \"The Letter,\" based on the same W. Somerset Maugham play of the same name as the 1940 movie The Letter. Much as in the play and the movie, the wife of a rubber plantation manager shoots and kills a man. Unfortunately, she had written a very compromising letter to the murder victim the day she had killed him. This letter then winds up in the hands of a blackmailer, played in the episode by Anna May Wong. The episode aired on October 15 1956.It was only a little over a month later, on November 22 1956 that Anna May Wong appeared in the Climax! episode \"The Chinese Game.\" The episode centred on a newspaper columnist who sees a vision of himself killing his wife for another woman while playing a game in a novelty show. Miss Wong's role in the episode may have been minor, as she is billed only as \"clerk.\"Her next guest appearance on a show would not be a minor role. In the February 11 1958 episode of Mike Hammer, \"So That's Who That Was,\" Mike Hammer (Darren McGavin) investigates the murder of a friend, which also leads him to the murder of a prominent citizen of Los Angeles's Chinatown. Anna May Wong played the widow of the murdered Chinatown citizen, Madame Chu. It was one of her television roles that actually allowed Anna May Wong to exercise her dramatic talents.Anna May Wong returned to Climax! in its May 1 1958 episode, \"The Deadly Tattoo.\" The episode centred on a serial killer who marks his victim with a tattoo who comes to Anna May Wong's character, Mayli, for help. According to Anna May Wong: From Laundryman's Daughter to Hollywood Legend by Graham Russell Gao Hodges, she apparently had fun making the episode.  She researched her role by going to tattoo shops around Los Angeles and worked with a vocal coach so she could speak in pidgin English (Miss Wong was a third generation American who grew up in Los Angeles). She was also amused that she got to wear an eyepatch.Anna May Wong's next guest appearances were on two episodes of the show Adventures in Paradise. Adventures in Paradise centred on Adam Troy (Gardner McKay), the captain of the schooner Tiki  III, who plied his trade in the Pacific. Anna May Wong played one of Troy's friends, the international moneychanger Lu Yang.  In the first episode, \"Lady from South Chicago (which aired on November 2 1959), centred on a Frenchwoman (played by Paulette Goddard) who is visited by a friend, who turns out to be an escaped convict from Australia. In the second episode, \"Mission to Manila\" (which aired on November 23 1959), Adam Troy investigates the mysterious death of a friend's brother.While Anna May Wong did not get a lot of screen exposure in her guest appearances on Adventures in Paradise, she played a major role in the Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp episode \"China Mary\" (which aired on May 15 1960). With racial unrest growing in Tombstone, Wyatt Earp (Hugh O'Brien) investigates the alleged murder of a white man at the hands of the Chinese population. As a result Wyatt's path crosses with China Mary (played by Anna May Wong), who controls much of what goes on in Tombstone's Chinese population. The episode gave Anna May Wong an important role and the opportunity to demonstrate her acting talent.Here it must be pointed out that China Mary is an actual historical figure. Born Sing Choy, China Mary was the most important figure among the Chinese in Tombstone. She ran a store and secured jobs for many in the Chinese community there, guaranteeing their good behaviour. She also ran several illegal operations, from gambling to prostitution. That having been said, she was also known for her generosity. She was a respected figure in Tombstone, both by the whites and the Chinese. When she died in 1906, her funeral was attended by a large number of people and she was buried in Tombstone's Boothill Cemetery.Anna May Wong's final television appearance was on an episode of The Barbara Stanwyck Show. An anthology series, The Barabra Stanwyck Show saw Miss Stanwyck playing a different role most weeks. Anna May Wong guest starred in the episode \"Dragon by the Tail,\" which aired on January 30 1961. In the episode Barbara Stanwyck played Josephine Little (nicknamed Little Joe), who runs an import/export business. In the episode Josephine Little is recruited by the CIA to rescue a scientist being held by the Communists. In the episode Anna May Wong played Joe's amah, A-Hsing. A-Hsing is not merely a servant. She speaks her mind freely and Josephine takes what she has to say seriously.Barbara Stanwyck appeared in three episodes of The Barbara Stanwyck Show as Josephine Little and and all three episodes were pilots for an episodic, adventure series. There is also an unaired episode of The Barbara Stanwyck Show titled \"Little Joe and Hong Kong\" in which Anna May Wong also appears, that appears to merely be another version of \"Dragon by Its Tail.\" Had Barbara Stanwyck's series about Josephine Little sold and had Anna May Wong lived, it seems possible she could have been a regular character on the show. Here it should be noted that Anna May Wong also appeared on the travelogue program Bold Journey on February 14 1956. She was interviewed by John Stephenson and showed her home movies of her trip to China in 1936.Here it must also be noted that there was an Anna May Wong billed in episodes of the British shows The Voodoo Factor and Danger Man in 1960, and the movies The Savage Innocents (1960) and Just Joe (1960). This is not the Anna May Wong who was born Wong Liu Tsong and had a career stretching back to the Silent Era, but a different, younger actress.Anna May Wong was set to play Madame Liang in the film adaptation of The Flower Drum Song (1961), but unable to do so because of ongoing issues with her health. She died of a heart attack on February 3, 1961, only four days after her final television appearance on The Barbara Stanwyck Show. She was only 56. It is difficult to say what would have happened had Miss Wong not had issues with her health and had lived to old age. It seems likely she would have appeared in The Flower Drum Song and that it would have revitalized her career. While roles for individuals of East Asian descent were not exactly common in the Sixties and many roles were still stereotypes, it was still an improvement over the Golden Age of Hollywood. While she may never have been the major star that she was in the Twenties and Thirties, it seems possible that she could have made a career out of guest appearances on television and the occasional appearance in movies. Anna May Wong may have made guest appearances on shows that used several East Asian actors, such as Hawaii Five-O and Kung Fu. We should perhaps be thankful that we have her few television appearances, some of which are readily available on streaming, allowing us to see a legendary performer display her considerable talent."},
{"title": "The Kim Sisters", "date": "Thursday, May 27, 2021", "text": "Over the past decade K-Pop groups have seen a good deal of success in the United States, particularly BTS. That having been said, Korean singers found their way to the US well before the 21st Century. The Kim Sisters were three Korean sisters (Kim Sook-ja, Kim Ai-ja, and Kim Min-ja) who landed a recording contact in the United States and appeared on such shows as The Ed Sullivan Show and The Dean Martin Show.Music ran in the Kim Sisters' family. Their father was conductor Kim Hae-song while their mother was Lee Nan-young, a popular singer in Korea prior to the Korean War. Unfortunately, Kim Hae-song would be captured and executed by North Korea in 1950. Afterwards Lee Nan-young adopted Min-ja and then formed a singing group consisting of the three girls. She would buy American records on the black market so her daughters could learn to sing them. The Kim Sisters would perform for American soldiers in bars and nightclubs, and they proved to be popular with the American military. Their fame in Korea among Americans spread to the point that producer Tom Ball signed them.It would take a year following Tom Ball having signed the Kim Sisters for them to arrive in the United States. Their first performances in the US were in Las Vegas at the Thunderbird Hotel as part of Thomas Ball's \"China Doll Revue.\" Once their contract with the Thunderbird Hotel ended, the Kim Sisters began performing at the Stardust.The Kim Sisters made their American television debut on The Dinah Shore Show on June 7 1959. Later in that September they made their debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. Ed Sullivan obviously liked The Kim Sisters, as they would appear on his show twenty times. Their last appearance on the show was in 1967. The Kim Sisters also released albums and several singles in the United States. While most of their singles saw little action on the American charts, in 1962 their cover of The Coasters' song \"Charlie Brown\" peaked at no. 7 on the Billboard singles chart, making it the first hit by Korean artists in American history.While the Kim Sisters might not have seen a good deal of success as recording artists, they were highly successful as stage performers. They appeared on such shows as The Dean Martin Show, The Hollywood Palace, Operation: Entertainment, The Joey Bishop Show, Della, The Barbara McNair Show and The Merv Griffin Show. They even played themselves in an episode of Ensign O'Toole. They also continued to perform on the Las Vegas Strip until 1967,when Min-ja got married. The remaining Kim Sisters would afterwards perform with their brothers well into the 1990s.Much of the popularity of the Kim Sisters in the Sixties might have been due to the fact that they were not only singers, but could play multiple instruments as well. In their television appearances they played everything from saxophone to bass guitar to banjo. Between them, the Kim Sisters could play over twenty different insturments. The Kim Sisters would be one of Americans' first introductions to Korean culture. It was not unusual for them to play the traditional Korean instrument, gaya-geum, or for them to dress in hanbok. An argument can even be made that they paved the way for modern day K-Pop groups. At the very least, they proved a Korean group could have success in the US."},
{"title": "\"Sukiyaki\" by Kyu Sakamoto", "date": "Wednesday, May 26, 2021", "text": "In 2020 K-Pop group BTS made history when their song \"Dynamite\" hit no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. That having been said, BTS were not the first East Asian artists to have a no. 1 single on the Hot 100, nor were they the first artists to have a no. 1 single in an East Asian language to have a hit on the Hot 100. That honour would go to Japanese singer Kyu Sakamoto, who hit no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with his song \"Sukiyaki\" in June 1963. It was not only the first song in an East Asian language to hit no. 1 on the chart, but the first song in a non-European language.Of course, \"Sukiyaki\" was not the song's original title. Its original title (and the one it still bears outside of English) is \"Ue o Muite Arukō\" (in English, \"I Look Up as I Walk\"). \"Ue o Muite Arukō\" was written by by lyricist Rokusuke Ei and composer Hachidai Nakamura. Rokusuke Ei wrote the lyrics when he was walking home from a protest  against the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan. He felt frustration and disappointment at the United States' continued military presence in his country. While \"Ue o Muite Arukō\" was inspired by Rokusuke Ei's feeling of dejection over the failed protests, its lyrics were written so that they could refer to any loss, such as lost love.\"Ue o Muite Arukō\" was recorded by Kyu Sakamoto, who had been a member of Danny Iida & Paradise King before he launched his own solo career. \"Ue o Muite Arukō\" would be his first hit as a solo artist, topping Japanese magazine Music Life's Popular Music Selling Record chart for three months. It was in 1963 that Louis Benjamin, chief executive of the British recording label Pye Records, visited Japan. He heard \"Ue o Muite Arukō\" several times while in Japan and decided to bring it to the United Kingdom. It was Louis Benjamin who renamed the song \"Sukiyaki.\" He thought \"Ue o Muite Arukō\" would be too hard for English speakers to pronounce and chose \"Sukiyaki\" because it was recognizably Japanese and he thought it sounded catchy. Of course, sukiyaki is a Japanese beef dish. A columnist in Newsweek said it would be something like renaming the song \"Moon River,\" \"Beef Stew\" in Japan.Regardless, \"Sukiyaki\" proved to be a hit in the United Kingdom, reaching no. 6 on the UK singles chart. Capitol Records released \"Sukiyaki\" in the United States where it proved even more successful. It hit no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1963 and topped the chart for three weeks.Today \"Ue o Muite Arukō\" may not seem that significant, but in 1963 its international success was very significant. Alongside the anime shows that made their way to the United States and Europe, as well as various Japanese movies, \"Ue o Muite Arukō\" signified Japan's reentry onto the world stage following World War II. Perhaps more importantly, it helped erode any mistrust of Japan on the part of Americans after the war. Beginning in the Sixties, Japan would increasingly be viewed not as an old enemy, but as a valued ally. \"Ue o Muite Arukō\" and other pop culture artefacts imported from Japan would help a good deal in bridging any gap between Japan and the United States."},
{"title": "Nancy Kwan: More Than Suzie Wong", "date": "Tuesday, May 25, 2021", "text": "Nancy Kwan occupies a singular place in the history of East Asian actors in Hollywood. She was the first East Asian actress to achieve superstardom since Anna May Wong. Born in Hong Kong to a Cantonese architect and a model of English and Scottish descent, Nancy Kwan exploded onto the scene with The World of Suzie Wong (1960) and Flower Drum Song (1961). She was the first actress of East Asian descent to regularly play lead roles since Anna May Wong. She also became a prominent sex symbol during the Sixties. While she would never repeat the success of The World of Suzie Wong and Flower Drum Song, she would appear in many more movies, as well as on television. Among Nancy Kwan's better remembered films is the all-star disaster movie Fate is the Hunter (1964). In the film Nancy Kwan plays Sally Fraser, the girlfriend of doomed airlines pilot Jack Savage (Rod Taylor). It is Sally who gives the movie its title, discussing the concept of fate with Savage in a flashback. Miss Kwan does well in a role that was historic for her. Despite being Eurasian in descent, it was the first time she ever played a Eurasian character.For much of her career Nancy Kwan was cast in comic roles. It should come as no surprise that she played the lead role in The Wild Affair (1965). In The Wild Affair she plays Marjorie Lee, a secretary about to get married and feeling about nervous about it. Wondering if she had missed out on life, she then decides to attempt what would be her first and only fling at her office's Christmas party. In some respects Nancy Kwan's casting seems odd given she is Eurasian and her parents are played by Bessie Love and Paul Curran. That having been said, Miss Kwan does well in the role as a strait-laced young woman who decides to kick up her heels. The movie is notable as one in which Nancy Kwan debuted a new style. Vidal Sassoon cut her famous long hair into a sharp bob.Nancy Kwan followed up The Wild Affair with another comedy, Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N. (1965). In Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N., Dick Van Dyke plays the Naval lieutenant of the title who finds himself on an island in the East Pacific when he is forced to eject from his plane. Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N. is severely dated in that it engages in stereotypes about Pacific Islanders (all of who seem to be played by East Asian actors except for Akim Tamiroff). While Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N. is a highly problematic film today and boasts a rather poor script, Nancy Kwan still stands out, giving a solid performance that is remarkable given how little she was given to work with.Nancy Kwan would only fare a little bit better with Nobody's Perfect (1968), another comedy that deals with the United States Navy. Nobody's Perfect chronicles the adventures of the crew of the USS Bustard shortly after World War II. The film is a run-of-the-mill service comedy, with the usual antics one would expect as such. That having been said, it has some notable performances from Doug McClure (who plays hospital corpsman \"Doc\" Willoughby) and James Shigeta (who plays Toshi O\"Hara). Nancy Kwan plays United States Navy nurse Lt. Tomiko Momayama, enlivening the proceedings with her performance.Perhaps unfortunately, Nancy Kwan's next movie may be her most famous besides The World of Suzie Wong and Flower Drum Song. The Wrecking Crew (1968) was both the last in the \"Matt Helm\" series of movies starring Dean Martin and the last movie Sharon Tate made to be released in her lifetime. In the Sixties spies were big business, and this was not lost on producer Irving Allen, who bought the rights to the \"Matt Helm\" novels by Donald Hamilton. While the \"Matt Helm\" novels are rather serious works that owe more to film noir than James Bond, the series of \"Matt Helm\" movies Irving Allen produced in the Sixties were outright spy spoofs. The first three movies were rather enjoyable, if frivolous romps. The Wrecking Crew is just plain bad and, at times, even downright sexist and racist. That having been said, the movie will always be remembered for a fight scene between Sharon Tate and Nancy Kwan (Bruce Lee choreographed the fight scenes). Both actresses handle themselves well and it is the one memorable scene in an otherwise dreary movie.In the Sixties roles were rare for actors of East Asian descent and as the decade passed, Nancy Kwan was finding it harder and harder to get roles. In the Seventies, then, she would look to Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Europe for parts. She also appeared on American television. She appeared in the two-part Kung Fu episode \"The Cenotaph\" In a portion of the episode told in flashback and set in China, Miss Kwan plays Mayli Ho, the Chinese Imperial consort, who is being pursued by a Chinese warlord. Nancy Kwan gives one of her best performances in the role, and she has chemistry with David Carradine (who played the lead role of Kwai Chang Caine). It must be noted that this would not be the last time the two appeared together. In the 1988 mini-series Noble House, Nancy Kwan played Claudia Chen, executive secretary to Ian Dunross of an international trading company (Pierce Brosnan).Throughout her career Nancy Kwan has taken poor material and turned out a good performance. This is certainly true of Night Children (1989). Class of 1984 (1982) had proven to be a hit and for the rest of the decade filmmakers would churn out similar movies about violent teenagers, Night Children among them.  Today, aside from being among the later films of David Carradine and Nancy Kwan's careers it might be best remembered as the second feature film my dear friend Vanessa Marquez. In Night Children David Carradine plays veteran cop Max who comes up against a violent youth gang. Nancy Kwan plays his girlfriend, parole officer Diane. Sadly, Night Children suffers from a bad script that at times borders on the unbelievable (particularly its ending). Worse yet, Max would not have been a very sympathetic character in 1989, let alone today, a situation made all the worse by the fact that David Carradine basically phones in his performance. The only reasons to watch Night Children are Vanessa (for the brief time she is on) and the performance of Nancy Kwan. Nancy Kwan takes the role of Diane and actually makes something of it.Fortunately, Nancy Kwan would appear in better movies later in her career. Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (1993) departs a good deal from Bruce Lee's actual life, but while it fails as biography it succeeds as entertainment. In the film Nancy Kwan plays Gussie Yang, the sardonic but kindly restaurant owner and Bruce Lee's boss who funds his marital arts training. Nancy Kwan gives a great performance in the role.Nancy Kwan has had a long career filled with many remarkable roles. And while not every film in which she has appeared is exactly a classic, they all the better for having Nancy Kwan in them. As mentioned earlier, Nancy Kwan has the talent for taking a poor script and still giving a great performance. If she is a pioneer with regards to East Asian actors in Hollywood, it is perhaps because she is just so very talented."},

{"title": "Mayberry, Everyone's Hometown", "date": "Saturday, May 22, 2021", "text": "(This blog post is part of The American Exprience Blogathon hosted by Moon in Gemini)In the United States, small towns with friendly inhabitants and exceedingly low crime rates are often referred to as \"Mayberry.\" Of course, the name \"Mayberry\" originated as the name of the fictional small town in The Andy Griffith Show and later Mayberry R.F.D. In both shows Mayberry is a small town in North Carolina. It was peaceful, with the only real crime being moonshiners living outside of town. It was also filled with friendly, if at times colourful, townspeople. In The Andy Griffith Show, Andy Griffith played Andy Taylor, the sheriff of Mayberry County (of which the city of Mayberry was the county seat), who usually plays straight man to the many inhabitants of the town.The Andy Griffith Show (and hence the town of Mayberry) originated with producer Sheldon Leonard. If the name \"Sheldon Leonard\" sounds familiar, it's because he had a long career as a character actor in movies, appearing in such films as Another Thin Man (1939) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). In the Fifties he became a television producer, producing the classic sitcom Make Room for Daddy (AKA The Danny Thomas Show). Sheldon Leonard came up with the idea of a man in a small town who was its newspaper editor, sheriff, and justice of the peace. To test out this idea, he asked writer Arthur Stander to develop an episode of Make Room for Daddy that would also serve as a backdoor pilot for a potential sitcom.It was the William Morris Agency that would provide the new show with its star. Andy Griffith had risen to prominence on the basis of the novelty record \"What It Was, Was Football\" and went onto star in the United States Steel Hour teleplay \"No Time for Sergeants\" (and later the Broadway play and movie of the same name) and the movie Face in the Crowd. Mr. Griffith was interested in starring in a television series. As a result, the William Morris Agency contacted Sheldon Leonard about Andy Griffith's interest in starring in a TV show.The casting of Andy Griffith would have an impact on the prospective new show. It was Mr. Griffith who suggested that the show be set in his home state of North Carolina, although initially Sheldon Leonard resisted the idea. Mr. Leonard simply wanted the show set somewhere in the South. It would also take some time before the town would be named \"Mayberry.\" They came up with a variety of names, among them Mt. Pilot (which would later be used for a fictional, slightly larger town near Mayberry).  Andy Griffith pointed out that there was a placed called Pilot Mountain near his hometown of Mt. Airy. Eventually someone came up the name \"Mayberry,\" a name very similar to \"Mt. Airy.\" Andy Griffith believes it could have been writer Athur Stander who came up with the name.It was then that the fictional town of Mayberry, North Carolina first appeared in the Make Room for Daddy episode \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith,\" which aired on February 15 1960. That having been said, \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\" does differ a bit from The Andy Griffith Show. Andy Griffith as Sheriff Andy Taylor and Ronnie Howard as his son Opie are the only characters from the show to appear in the backdoor pilot. Frances Bavier does appear in the episode, but not as Aunt Bee. On the show Andy Taylor was only Mayberry's sheriff and justice of the peace, but in \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\" he was also the town's newspaper editor. While the idea of a drunk who locks himself in jail when he has had a few too many originated with the pilot, that drunk was Will (played by Frank Cady later of Petticoat Junction and Green Acres fame) rather than Otis Campbell (played by Hal Smith).As a backdoor pilot \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\" proved successful. General Foods had first access to the new show and they signed on immediately as its sponsor. The Andy Griffith Show debuted on October 3 1960 on CBS. In the beginning the show centred on Andy Taylor, the sheriff and justice of the peace of Mayberry, North Carolina. Andy was a widower with a young son named Opie, played by Ronnie Howard. Living with Andy and Opie was Andy's aunt, Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier), who served as their housekeeper and cook. As Mayberry County did not have much in the way of a population, Andy only had one deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts). Don Knotts and Andy Griffith had been friends since they had both worked on the Broadway production of No Time for Sergeants and later worked together on the movie version. When Andy Griffith told Don Knotts about his new show, it was Mr. Knotts who suggested to Mr. Griffith that Sheriff Taylor would need a deputy. In creating the character of Deputy Barney Fife, Don Knotts drew upon Mr. Morrison, the nervous and high-strung character he had played in the \"Man in the Street\" interviews on The Steve Allen Show, adding a streak of self-importance as well. Barney would prove to be the breakout character on the show, easily becoming its most popular character.In the beginning Andy Griffith played Andy Taylor as a country bumpkin not unlike the church deacon in \"What It Was, Was Football\" or  Will Stockdale in No Time for Sergeants. It was during the first season that Andy Griffith and the producers decided the show would be better if Andy acted as a straight man to Mayberry's many colourful characters (particularly Barney Fife). Because of this The Andy Griffith Show began to focus much more on the citizens of Mayberry, to the point that the show was as much about the town as it was Sheriff Andy Taylor. In fact, creator and producer Sheldon Leonard would later express regret that the show was named The Andy Griffith Show, thinking Mayberry would have been a more fitting title.With the emphasis on the show shifted to the city of Mayberry, The Andy Griffith Show developed a rather large ensemble of recurring characters. Among them was Mayberry's barber, Floyd. When Floyd first appeared in the first season episode \"Stranger in Town,\" he was played by actor Walter Baldwin. It would be the very next episode, \"Andy Goes Hollywood,\" that actor Howard McNear would take over the role of Floyd. Floyd Lawson was a bit absent minded and never particularly in a hurry, particularly when speaking. Floyd grew in importance as a character as the show progressed, with Floyd's Barber Shop becoming a hangout for many of the men in Mayberry. The aforementioned Otis Campbell (played by Hal Smith) would also become an important character on the show. Otis was the town drunk, although a somewhat responsible one. He would let himself in the jail when he need to sleep off one of his drunken benders. Not only did Otis Campbell become an important character on the show, but he was also one of the earliest citizens of Mayberry to appear on the show. He first appeared in the show's second episode, \"Manhunt.\"While Floyd Lawson and Otis Campbell would both prove to be important to The Andy Griffith Show, two of the most successful characters on the series would both bear the last name \"Pyle.\" Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors) was a gentle, but none too bright gas station attendant at Wally's Filling Station. The character of Gomer Pyle was based on a an actual gas station attendant that writer Everett Greenbaum had encountered. He talked the new character over with fellow writer Jim Fritzell and producer Aaron Ruben, and so Gomer Pyle was created. As to how Jim Nabors was cast in the role, Andy Griffith caught his act at the Horn, a club in Santa Monica, California. Gomer Pyle first appeared in the third season episode \"The Bank Job\" and quickly became one of the show's most popular characters. He became so popular that Gomer was spun off into his own, Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C., on which Gomer had joined the Marines.Gomer's place on the show would be taken by his cousin Goober Pyle (George Lindsay). Ultimately, Goober would appear more than any other character on The Andy Griffith Show except for the show's lead characters (Andy, Opie, Barney, and Aunt Bee). Gomer Pyle's cousin, Gomer often referred to Goober well before he made his first appearance on the show. Goober would make his first appearance on The Andy Griffith Show in the episode \"Fun Girls,\" the only episode in which Goober and Gomer appear together (although Goober would later appear in one episode of Gomer Pyle U.S. M.C. and they would appear together in the reunion movie Return to Mayberry). Goober was somewhat backwards and not terribly bright, but he was also an excellent mechanic and repaired cars at Wally's Filling Station. Eventually he bought Wally's Filling Station. George Lindsay would continue playing Goober as one of the leads on Mayberry R.F.D. He guest starred as Goober on the first episode of The New Andy Griffith Show, on which Andy Griffith played Greenwood, North Carolina mayor pro tem Andy Sawyer (apparently Andy Taylor and Andy Sawyer were related). He also played the character in an unsold pilot, Goober and the Trucker's Paradise, in 1978, as well as twenty years of Hee-Haw (apparently Goober left Mayberry for Cornfield County).Clara Edwards (Hope Summers) was Aunt Bee's best friend and sometime rival. Clara is a bit of a gossip, something which at times causes Andy some trouble. While, she and Bee are friends, they have something of a competitive relationship. She first appeared in the first season episode \"Andy and Opie, Housekeepers.\" It would be some time before the show's creators settled on the name \"Clara Edwards.\" In her first and second appearances, she is called \"Bertha Edwards.\" By her third episode she had become \"Clara Johnson.\" It wasn't until the sixth season episode \"The Church Organ\" that she would finally be named Clara Edwards.One character who remains phenomenally popular did not actually appear that often. Ernest T. Bass (Howard Morris) only appeared in five episodes of The Andy Griffith Show. Ernest T. Bass was an unruly hillbilly who took great pleasure in causing trouble. He is adept at throwing rocks and takes great pride in breaking out windows in buildings in Mayberry. He tends to be overly boastful, often bragging about his feats of strength. His character can be best summed up by a phrase Barney often said of Ernest T. during his appearances, \"He's a nut!\" While there were many recurring characters on The Andy Griffith Show, except for two of them, Andy's girlfriends did not stick around long. During the first season, Andy's girlfriend was pharmacist Ellie Walker (Elinor Donaue). Ellie only stayed for twelve episodes. After Ellie's departure, Andy went through a succession of girlfriends. County nurse Mary Simpson was Andy's girlfriend for two episodes, although she was played by two different actresses (Julie Adams in the first episode and Sue Ane Langdon in the second). As county nurse Peggy MacMillan, Joanna Moore lasted a bit longer on the show appearing in four episodes. Of course, Andy's final girlfriend and the one he would marry would be Helen Crump (Aneta Corsaut). Curiously, Helen was not initially meant to be Andy's girlfriend. She was merely meant to be Opie's schoolteacher in the episode \"Andy Discovers America.\" As it turned out, actors Andy Griffith and Aneta Corsaut clicked, and as a result Helen Crump became Andy's girlfriend. She appeared for the remainder of the show's run.While Andy would go through a number of girlfriends on The Andy Griffith Show, for Barney Fife there was only one. Barney did date a few other women in single episodes of the show and he had an ongoing flirtation with the unseen waitress Juanita from The Bluebird Cafe, in the end Thelma Lou (Betty Lynn) was his girl. Thelma Lou was sweet natured, if at times a bit sensitive. And while Barney occasionally sees other women, he is prone to jealousy if another male pays attention to Thelma Lou, even Gomer Pyle and Opie. Sadly, Barney and Thelma Lou would part ways when he moved to Raleigh. In the episode \"The Return of Barney Fife\" it is revealed that she had married a man named Gerald Whitfield. To say Barney was crushed would be an understatement. During the course of The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R. F.D. we learn a good deal about the town. It was named for its founder Lord Mayberry, although the episode \"The Battle of Mayberry' states that it was nearly named \"Taylortown\" after one of Andy's ancestors, Colonel Carleton Taylor. Perhaps the most notable event in Mayberry's history was the Battle of Mayberry, a conflict between the settlers of Mayberry and the local Cherokee. While the inhabitants of Mayberry (including the local Cherokee) have built the event up to mythical proportions, in truth it was little more than the citizens of Mayberry and the Cherokee yelling at each other before making peace, hunting together, and getting drunk together. One fact that cannot be pinned down about Mayberry is its population. A sign in the final episode of The Andy Griffith Show reads \"Population: 5,630.\" In the episode \"The Song Festers,\" choirmaster John Masters gives Mayberry's population as \"two-thousand people.\" In \"The Statue,\" county clerk Howard Sprague gives Mayberry's population as 1,800.While there had been fictional towns on television before Mayberry (Mayfield on Leave It to Beaver being an example), Mayberry may have been the first to have been fully realized. Not only could viewers name many of its citizens, but they could also name many of the locations around Mayberry as well, well beyond the Mayberry Courthouse that figured so prominently in The Andy Griffith Show. The church Andy attended was All Souls Church. Its denomination was never named (as was the custom on network television in the Sixties), although I suspect it was Southern Baptist. There can be little doubt that there were other churches in town (my hometown has a population of 1,600 and five churches), none were ever shown. Mayberry has one bank and it figured prominently in episodes of The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D. Strangely enough for a town with such a low crime rate, Mayberry Security was subject to robberies from time to time.Several places to eat were named on The Andy Griffith Show. Although it was never actually shown, the Blue Bird Diner was frequently mentioned, particularly when Barney was on the phone with Juanita. Mayberry also had a diner downtown at which Andy and Barney ate, the Mayberry Diner. Morelli's was a more upscale restaurant just outside of Mayberry and appeared on both The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D. Snappy Lunch was another eatery in Mayberry, although it was only mentioned once (in the episode \"Andy the Matchmaker\").Several stores were mentioned throughout the run of The Andy Griffith Show. The local grocery store was called Foley's Grocery or Crowley's Market, leading some to conclude Mr. Foley (Stanley Farrar and Frank Ferguson) owned the store, but Art Crowley (Frank Warren) managed it. Clothing stores included Luken's Style Shop and Mort's Clothing Store. Weaver's Department Store was the department store in town. Other stores included Morrison Sisters Flower Shop, Nelson's Hardware Store, Sterling Jewelry Store, and Willick's Shoe Shop. The Grand Theatre was the cinema in town where Andy and Barney took their dates and Goober watched many a monster movie.Beyond Floyd's Barber Shop, Walker's Drug Store, Wally's Filling Station, and Emmett's Fix-It Shop, there were several other businesses named on The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D. These included Fleur De Lis Beauty Salon, Monroe's Funeral Parlor, Simmons Seeds, and F. Wakefield Beauty Salon.The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D. were shot at the old RKO Forty Acres Lot, which Desilu Studios had bought in 1957. It had already been used on such classic movies as King Kong and Gone with the Wind. With regards to television, The Adventures of Superman and episodes of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet were shot there. While The Andy Griffith Show was in production, the lot was occasionally used by other shows, including Batman, The Green Hornet, Mission: Impossible, and even Star Trek (the episodes \"Miri\" and \"City on the Edge of Forever\"). Sadly, the Mayberry lot would be torn down in 1978.One common misconception about Mayberry is that there were no Black people in the town. While none of the lead characters or supporting characters on The Andy Griffith Show were Black, Blacks did in fact appear on the show. Black extras were seen as early as the first season episode \"Ellie Comes to Town\" and would also be seen in such episodes as \"Andy's English Valet,\" \"Opie and the Carnival,\" \"Barney Comes to Mayberry,\" and others. That having been said, the only Black character to have lines in an episode of The Andy Griffith Show was Opie's football coach Flip Conway (Rockne Tarkington) in the episode \"Opie's Piano Lesson.\" In a retrospective on the show, Howard Morris, who directed several episodes of The Andy Griffith Show in addition to playing Ernest T. Bass, said that many on the show wanted to include Black characters, but CBS was nervous that including Black characters would hurt the show's ratings in the South. Andy Griffith would later express regret that Black characters had not been cast on the show. Fortunately, the network had apparently changed their mind by the time Mayberry R.F.D. had debuted. Among the recurring characters was a neighbour of lead character Sam Jones (Ken Berry), Ralph Barton (Charles Lampkin). Ralph had a teenager daughter, Dorothy June (Amanda Sykes), and a pre-teen son Martin (Calvin Peeler). Over time The Andy Griffith Show would see changes to its cast. The most significant of these was the departure of Don Knotts. Mr. Knotts left the show basically due to a miscommunication between him and Andy Griffith. Mr. Griffith had said that he would not do the show for more than five years. After five years, then, Don Knotts left to pursue a career in film. On the show it was explained that Barney had left Mayberry to take a job as a detective in Raleigh. Don Knotts would continue to appear as Barney in guest appearances on the show, appearing in five more episodes during the show's run. He also guest starred as Barney in the first episode of Mayberry R.F.D., \"Andy and Helen Get Married.\"While Don Knotts left The Andy Griffith Show for movies, Howard McNear left the show in 1967 due to declining health. He died only around two years after leaving the show, on January 3 1969.  Floyd Lawson's absence from the show was explained as Floyd having retired. In 1966 Hal Smith ceased appearing as Otis Campbell on the show.Just as various actors left The Andy Griffith Show, so too were actors added. Jack Dodson first appeared as county clerk Howard Sprague in the episode \"The County Clerk.\" Howard was overly close to his mother, something of a Milquetoast,  and a bit socially awkward. Howard would become one of the central characters on The Andy Griffith Show in its later seasons, and was one of the leads on Mayberry R.F.D. Following the departure of Howard McNear, the character of Emmett Clark (Paul Hartman) was added to the show. Emmett Clark was the local handyman who ran Emmett's Fix-it Shop, which became the central hangout for Mayberry's men  following the closure of Floyd's Barber Shop. Like Howard, he would be one of the leads of Mayberry R.F.D.It was before the eighth and final season of The Andy Griffith Show that Andy Griffith decided to leave the show and return to making movies. This did not make either CBS or the show's sponsor, General Foods, particularly happy, as the show was still very high rated (it came in no. 3 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1966-1967 season). Andy Griffith was then convinced to do an eighth and final season. At the same time the character of farmer Sam Jones (Ken Berry) was introduced. Sam was elected to the city council and would increasingly play a large role in episodes as the season progressed. Andy and Helen also finally became engaged. Essentially, during its eighth season, The Andy Griffith Show was transitioning to Mayberry R.F.D.Although often referred to as a spinoff, Mayberry R.F.D. should perhaps more properly be considered a continuation of The Andy Griffith Show without Andy Griffith. It was developed by Bob Ross, who had written several episodes of The Andy Griffith Show. It should come as no surprise, then, that the format of Mayberry R.F.D. resembled that of The Andy Griffith Show to a great degree. It centred on farmer and Mayberry city councilman Sam Jones, who, like Andy, was a widower with a young son (Mike played by Buddy Foster). Andy and Helen married in the debut episode of Mayberry R.F.D. and moved away, after which Aunt Bee became Sam's housekeeper. Goober, Howard, and Emmett remained on the show. They were  joined by a few new characters. Millie Swason (Arlene Golonka) was Sam's girlfriend (curiously, Arlene Golonka had played Howard's girlfriend, Millie Hutchins, on two episodes of The Andy Griffith Show). Harold (Richard Steele) was Mike's best friend. As mentioned earlier, Ralph Barton was Sam's neighbour on the show. Both Clara Edwards and Emmett's wife Martha (Mary Lansing), from The Andy Griffith Show, continued to appear on Mayberry R.F.D.Andy Griffith would guest star on Mayberry R. F.D. in its first season. Including the premiere episode, \"Andy and Helen Get Married,\" he appeared in the episodes \"Help on the Farm,\" \"Youth Takes Over,\" and \"Mike's Losing Streak.\" He made one last guest appearance on the show in the first episode of the second season, \"Andy's Baby.\" It centred on the christening of Andy and Helen's new baby, Andy Jr.Mayberry R.F.D. saw one cast change during its run. After the second season Frances Bavier retired from acting. In the third season episode \"The New Housekeeper\" it is said that Aunt Bee left to take care of her sister. She was replaced as Sam's housekeeper by his cousin Alice Cooper (Alice Ghostley). Alice was a sharp contrast to Aunt Bee. For one thing she was younger (Alice Ghostley was only around 46 when she joined Mayberry R.F.D., while Frances Bavier was in her sixties when she left). For another thing, the character of Alice had served in the Army for twenty years before becoming Sam's new housekeeper.Mayberry R.F.D. proved to be popular on its debut, ranking no. 4 for the 1968-1969 season. It maintained that position in its second season, but dropped to no. 15 for its third season (probably due to new competition from Monday Night Football on ABC and The ABC Monday Night Movie). Of course, no. 15 in the Nielsen ratings for the year is still impressive and in any previous year it may have been renewed. Unfortunately, the 1970-1971 season was the season of the Rural Purge. For much of the Sixties ABC and NBC had pursued and attracted viewers in the key demographic of people aged 18 to 34 living in cities, who were perceived as more desirable by advertisers. For much of the Sixties, CBS ignored this key demographic in favour of the overall Nielsen ratings of any given show. All of this began to change around 1967, when CBS cancelled I've Got a Secret, To Tell the Truth, What's My Line?, and even Gunsmoke because their audiences skewed older. Gunsmoke was swiftly returned to the schedule as it turned out to be the favourite show of Babe Paley, wife of CBS chief executive William S. Paley. The three panel shows received no such reprieve.It was then in the late Sixties that CBS decided to change their strategy and pursue the key demographic of urban individuals aged 18-34. This was complicated by the fact that the Prime Time Access Rule would go into effect during the 1971-1972 season. The Prime Time Access Rule was a FCC regulation that effectively reduced the amount of network programming during prime time, meaning the networks had to cancel many more shows than before. With an audience that was largely rural and older, CBS then decided to cancel every single rural show on the air, from the country variety show Hee-Haw to the sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies. Mayberry R.F.D. was then cancelled with its third season. Ranking no. 15 for the year, it remains one of the highest rated shows to ever be cancelled.Of course, this did not mean Mayberry had disappeared forever. It could still be seen in syndicated reruns of The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D. The character of Goober could be seen in new episodes of Hee-Haw, which entered syndication following its cancellation by CBS. If anything, The Andy Griffith Show would become even more popular in syndication as new generations discovered the show. It was then in 1986 that the television reunion movie Return to Mayberry aired.Much of the original cast returned for the movie, including Andy Griffith as Andy Taylor, Don Knotts as Barney, Ron Howard as Opie, Howard Morris as Ernest T. Bass, Jim Nabors as Gomer Pyle, George Lindsay as Goober Pyle, Jack Dodson as Howard Sprague, Aneta Corsault as Helen, and Betty Lynn as Thelma Lou. Howard Sprague was constantly changing his hair colour in an attempt to look young. Otis Campbell was no longer an alcoholic and was now Mayberry's ice cream man. Gomer now co-owns the gas station with Goober, now named G 'n G. It turns out that Thelma Lou got a divorce after one year of marriage. She and Barney rekindle their romance and finally marry. For the most part Return to Mayberry maintained continuity with The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D. except for one glaring error: Andy and Helen's son Andy Jr. from the Mayberry R.F.D. episode \"Andy's Baby\" is never mentioned. The Mayberry set at 40 Acres having been torn down several years ago, Los Olivos, California stood in for Mayberry.Return to Mayberry proved successful in the ratings. The TV reunion movie was so successful that it could have led to more Mayberry projects had Andy Griffith not already been committed to the TV series Matlock (then in its first season). Return to Mayberry would then be the last viewers would see of Mayberry, North Carolina.There can be no doubt that the success of The Andy Griffith Show and its successor Mayberry R.F.D. was largely due to how well realized Mayberry was. Earlier sitcoms had featured fictional towns, such as Springfield on Father Knows Best and Hilldale on The Donna Reed Show, but on those shows it was individual families that took a central role, not the town. On both The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D. it was arguably Mayberry that took centre stage. The town of Mayberry as a whole was as much of a character on the show as Andy, Barney, or Floyd. People from small towns could watch The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D. and identify with many of the situations and even characters on the show. I suspect there are many small towns with a Gomer Pyle, a Floyd Lawson, or even a Barney Fife. In making the town central to the show, The Andy Griffith Show was something of a pioneer. Mayberry is the spiritual ancestor of every fictional small town and community to appear on American television ever since, including Walton's Mountain on The Waltons; the unnamed town on Newhart; Evening Shade, Alabama on Evening Shade; Twin Peaks on the show of the same name; Cicely, Alaska on Northern Exposure; Stars Hollow on Gilmore Girls; and Pawnee, Indiana on Parks and Recreation.Of course, because The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D. centred on Mayberry, the show was very much a character driven comedy. The show's humour did not arise from one-liners or even from contrived situations, but from the characters themselves. On The Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry R.F.D., the characters drove the plot rather than the plot driving the characters. What is more The Andy Griffith Show differed from the domestic comedies of the Fifties and even its contemporary sitcoms in other ways. The Fifties had seen a rise in domestic comedies, such as Father Knows Best and The Donna Reed Show, that could justifiably be described as gentle. The late Fifties and early Sixties saw a shift to broad comedies such as Dobie Gillis and The Beverly Hillbillies, comedies that could be so broad that they could be surreal at times. The Andy Griffith Show struck a middle ground between these two extremes. It could be very broad at times (such as the episode \"The Loaded Goat,\" in which a goat has eaten dynamite), but it was never so broad that it departed from reality. While many of the situations on such comedies as Gilligan's Island and The Monkees were very unlikely to happen, most of the situations on The Andy Griffith Show conceivably could.If there is one criticism that can be directed at the portrayal of Mayberry on The Andy Griffith Show and to a lesser degree Mayberry R.F.D., it is the town's lack of diversity. I grew up in and still live in a small town not unlike Mayberry. We have a relatively large Black population and many of our most prominent citizens are Black. By the same token, I am part Cherokee and one of my close friends in my youth was nearly full Cherokee. Had Mayberry been realistically portrayed, many of the characters would have been Black and some may have even been Cherokee. As it was, while Black extras appeared on The Andy Griffith Show, only one Black character (Opie's aforementioned football coach) had lines on the show  and only one Cherokee character appeared (Tom Strongow in \"The Battle of Mayberry,\" played by Norman Alden, who was white rather than Naive American). Of course, here it must be pointed out that most other sitcoms of the era did not feature characters belonging to ethnic minorities either, not The Beverly Hillbillies, not Bewitched, not Green Acres. Sadly, while African Americans would increasingly be featured in roles in dramas as the Sixties progressed (examples being I Spy, Star Trek, and Mission: Impossible), the broadcast networks were very reticent to include them in situation comedies. It would take the show Julia, starring Diahann Carroll, in 1968 to break the colour barrier in sitcoms. While I would have preferred The Andy Griffith Show to have included Black and even Native American characters in its cast, I also realize that it would not have been realistic to expect them to have done so given the attitudes of the networks in the Sixties. Here I must also point out that things have not changed terribly much in American television. Native Americans are still nearly invisible on the small screen, while East Asian Americans and Latinos are often absent even from shows set in cities with large populations of each (for instance, Los Angeles and New York City).Regardless, The Andy Griffith Show would have a lasting impact. Even today it can be found as a syndicated rerun on local stations and cable channels around the country. As mentioned earlier, it would have an influence on every sitcom and drama to feature a small town ever since. It has even had an impact on American English. As mentioned earlier, small towns with relatively low crime rates and friendly inhabitants are often referred to as \"Mayberry.\" A self-important, high-strung police officer might find himself nicknamed, \"Barney Fife.\" Rural people who are not terribly bright might be described as \"Gomer Pyle.\" To a degree it can be said that Mayberry's appeal lies in its nearly utopian portrayal of a small town. It has relatively little crime and any problems that arise can be worked out with a bit of time and understanding. I have no doubt that many watch The Andy Griffith Show and  Mayberry R.F.D. purely for escapism. For many living in small towns, however, they can see something of Mayberry in their own hometown, from the various characters that inhabit the town to the situations that sometimes arise. If Mayberry became a synonym for small towns across the United States, it is perhaps because at the same time it portrays a somewhat idealized vision of those towns that still has some semblance to reality. To wit, Mayberry was the first small town to be fully realized on American television, and it remains the most famous."},

Although often described as a cult film, <i>The Wicker Man</i> can be counted as a classic horror movie. The magazine <i>Total Film </i>listed it as the sixth greatest British film of all time in 2004. <i>Empire</i> listed it at no. 485 in its list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\" in 2008. In its list of the \"25 Greatest Horror Films of All Time\" from 2010, <i>The Guardian </i>placed it at no. 4. Sir Christopher Lee considered it his best film, while Edward Woodward counted it among his favourite films he had made.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\"><i>The Wicker Man</i> stars Edward Woodward as Sgt. Neil Howie, a Scottish police officer well known for his Christian piety. Sgt. Howie is sent to Summerisle, an island off the coast of Scotland, to investigate the case of a missing girl. Summerisle is well known for its produce (particularly its apples). What is not so well known is that the island has entirely returned to Celtic paganism. Sgt. Howie then finds his Christian beliefs in conflict with the pagan beliefs of the natives of Summerisle, particularly as embodied by Lord Summerisle himself (Sir Christopher Lee).<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">The origins of <i>The Wicker Man</i> go back to a meeting in 1971 between screenwriter Anthony Shaffer and Sir Christopher Lee. At the time Sir Christopher Lee was eager to do something different from the Hammer Horrors he was best known for, as well as play more challenging roles. At the time Anthony Shaffer was part of a production company that made commercials and informational films. It had been founded by Mr. Shaffer and Robin Hardy in the late Sixties. Robin Hardy, who would direct <i>The Wicker Man</i>, had made educational programs in the United States, some of which aired on<i> Esso World Theatre </i>on National Educational Television (NET), the forerunner of PBS. It was in the late Sixties that he returned home to Britain, where he formed a production company that made commercials and informational films with Anthony Shaffer.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\"> Like Anthony Shaffer, Robin Hardy also wanted to make a horror movie. Inspiration struck Mr. Hardy when he read the novel <i>Ritual</i> by David Pinner, in which a Christian police officer investigated the murder of a young girl in a Cornish rural village. Messrs. Hardy and Shaffer then paid David Pinner &#163;15,000 for the film rights to the novel. It was while he was initially working on the screenplay that Anthony Shaffer decided a faithful adaptation of <i>Ritual</i> would not play well on the big screen. In the end he developed a plot loosely based on that of the novel, while drawing upon the practices of pagan Celts as portrayed in Julius Caesar's account of his wars in Gaul and other works on Celtic paganism. Robin Hardy and Anthony Shaffer also decided the Celtic paganism in the film would be portrayed objectively and as accurately as possible. They also decided that it would be a more literate and intellectual horror movie than most, with as little blood and gore as possible.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">As mentioned earlier, Sir Christopher Lee was a part of the project from the very beginning, That having been said, the cast could have been slightly different if things had not gone as they had. Producer Peter Snell had wanted Edward Woodward, then best known for the British TV show <i>Callan</i>, for the role of Sgt. Howie from the very beginning. Despite this, the role was first offered to Michael York, who declined it. Robin Hardy then approached David Hemings, known for the movie <i>Blowup</i> (1967), but he also passed on the role. Sir Christopher Lee approached his frequent co-star and long-time friend Peter Cushing about the role, but he was unavailable. It was then that producer Peter Snell and Anthony Shaffer recommended Edward Woodward, who was cast in the part.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">Britt Ekland was cast in the important role of the innkeeper's daughter Willow MacGregor. At the time Miss Ekland had already appeared in several movies, including <i>The Night they Raided Minsky's </i>(1968) and <i>Get Carter</i> (1971). Her singing voice was dubbed by Scottish singer Annie Ross, although rumours persist that her speaking voice was as well. Furthermore, her famous nude scene in the movie would be shot using body doubles. At the time Britt Ekland was three months pregnant. Anthony Shaffer had seen Diane Cilento on stage and she was cast in the role of schoolteacher Miss Rose. She had already appeared in several movies, including <i>Tom&nbsp; Jones</i> (1963).<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">Ultimately one other veteran of Hammer Films would play a major role in <i>The Wicker Man</i>. Ingrid Pitt was already well associated with horror films, having appeared in Hammer films' <i>The Vampire Lovers</i> (1970) and <i>Countess Dracula</i> (1971), as well as Amicus's <i>The House That Dripped Blood</i> (1971). She was friends with Sir Christopher Lee and had heard about <i>The Wicker Man</i> only a few days before it was about to shoot. She called Robin Hardy on the phone and asked if he had a part for her in the film. Fortunately, the role of the Librarian was still open.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">Even though <i>The Wicker Man</i> was set around May Eve and May Day, the movie was shot from October 9 1972 to November 25 1972. It was largely shot in villages in Dumfries &amp; Galloway in Scotland. Culzean Castle in Maybole, South Ayrshire served as Lord Summerisle's castle. Sgt. Howie's seaplane landed at Plockton, Highland. As to the famous climax, it took place at Burrow Head on the Isle of Whithorn. The fact that the movie took place in spring, but was shot in autumn, did present some problems. Artificial blossoms and leaves had to be glued on trees in many scenes. An overhead shot of orchards wasn't shot in Scotland at all. It was shot in South Africa, where, being south of the equator, it was spring.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">As might be expected in Scotland in October and November it was very cold, which presented a problem for the actors, who were dressed as if&nbsp; it were spring. The day that the climax was filmed on the Isle of Whithorn was particularly cold and windy. According to a story told on the commentary on <i>The Wicker Man: Special Edition Director's Cut</i> DVD, coats were brought out to the three lead actresses to wear in between takes. Britt Ekland eagerly took her coat. Diane Cilento graciously took her coat and said, \"Thank you.\"&nbsp; Ingrid Pitt, in solidarity with the supporting actors, refused her coat, stating flatly, \"If the extras don't have time to put on their coats, then neither do I!\"<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">Unfortunately, the release of <i>The Wicker Man</i> would go even less smoothly than shooting had.&nbsp; British Lion Films, the production company behind the movie, underwent a change in ownership not long after <i>The Wicker Man</i> had finished shooting. Sir Christopher Lee claimed that Michael Deeley, the new managing director at British Lion, said that <i>The Wicker Man</i> was one of the ten worst movies he had ever seen. Michael Deeley denied that he ever said this, instead saying that while <i>The Wicker Man</i> was fascinating and genuinely ahead of its time, it was also self-indulgent and could be difficult for audiences. Regardless, Robin Hardy and Anthony Shaffer have both said that the marketing people at British Lion did not know what to make of <i>The Wicker Man</i>.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">With a film that British Lion was unsure how to market, a copy of <i>The Wicker Man</i> was sent to low-budget movie legend Roger Corman to get his opinion on the film. Mr. Corman suggested some cuts to the film. The film's editor Eric Boyd-Perkins then cut about 12 minutes from the movie. In the United Kingdom it was released on a double bill with <i>Don't Look Now</i> (1973), a cerebral film that touched upon the occult. Unfortunately, the double bill of <i>The Wicker Man</i> and <i>Don't Look Now</i> did not prove to be successful in Britain.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">With regards to the American release of <i>The Wicker Man</i>, National General offered $300,000 to distribute the movie in the United States. Unfortunately, National General took bankruptcy only four days after the deal with British Lion was signed. Warner Bros. then acquired the North American distribution rights to <i>The Wicker Man</i>. Warner Bros. held test viewings of <i>The Wicker Man</i> in drive-in theatres and a college theatre in Atlanta starting in May 1974. Later in the year it would be shown in Southern California. It was in May 1974 that <i>Variety</i> gave <i>The Wicker Man</i> a very positive review. Even given the review in <i>Variety</i>, the distribution of <i>The Wicker Man</i> in the United States would still prove to be somewhat spotty. In 1977 it was shown in Minneapolis, Mississippi, and Louisiana. In 1978 <i>The Wicker Man</i> was shown in Oregon, Connecticut, and Chicago. It was in 1979 that the 96 minute, reconstructed version was released to American theatres (more on that later).<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">Even as <i>The Wicker Man</i> was popping up in scattered, American theatres in the mid to late Seventies, its reputation in the United States was growing. It was in volume 6, issue 3 of <i>Cinefantastique</i> in 1977 that the magazine published an article on the film, referring to it as \"the <i>Citizen Kane</i> of horror movies.\" It would be the growing interest in the United States that would also revive interest in <i>The Wicker Man</i> in its native Britain. <br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">It was also the growing interest in the United States that led Robin Hardy to look into restoring <i>The Wicker Man</i>. He discovered that Warner Bros. had sold the American distribution rights to the film to a small firm called Abraxas for only $20,000. Robin Hardy contacted Abraxas and together they tried to find its original footage. Unfortunately, the film's negatives could not be found. It has been alleged that they were stored in a vault at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. After Shepperton Studios changed owners, its new owners asked that everything in the vault be destroyed. Fortunately, Robin Hardy remembered that the film had been sent to Roger Corman, who still had a copy. This 96 minute version was then released in the United States in 1979.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">Later Canal+ obtained the rights to <i>The Wicker Man</i> and in 2001 sought to release the complete film. This restoration used a telecine transfer to 1-inch videotape of Roger Corman's copy (which had been lost), which was then combined with material from the earlier versions of the film to create a 99 minute version of <i>The Wicker Man</i>.&nbsp; While many fans believe this version to be incomplete, it appears that the legendary 102 minute version of <i>The Wicker Man</i> does not exist. According to John Simon of Abraxas, he simply mistimed Roger Corman's copy of the movie. He has said, \"I guess I just looked at my watch at the beginning and end of the screening, and I had always assumed that someone else would double-check the timing.\"<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">Yet another version of <i>The Wicker Man</i> would be released by StudioCanal. In 2013 StudioCanal sought to find the material still missing from <i>The Wicker Man</i>. This led to the discovery of a 92 minute, 35mm print in the Harvard Film Archive. StudioCanal then released a 91 minute version of <i>The Wicker Man</i> on DVD under the title <i>The Wicker Man: The Final Cut</i>. Longer than the 88 minute version originally released to theatres, it is shorter than the 99 minute version that had been released in 2001. <br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">If anything, since <i>The Wicker Man</i> became a cult film in the United States in the late Seventies, its reputation has only grown. As mentioned earlier, it has made lists of the greatest films ever made. Much of the reason for the reputation of <i>The Wicker Man</i> is that it was unlike any horror movie made before it. The majority of the film is set in broad daylight, with only a few scenes set at night. Furthermore, until the climax, <i>The Wicker Man</i> is not so much horrifying as it is unsettling, as the viewer is forced to confront the paganism of Summerisle much as Sgt. Howie has to. Setting it further apart from previous horror movies is that there is a good deal of music in <i>The Wicker Man</i>, enough that it very nearly qualifies as a musical. The songs in the movie consist of both folk songs (such as \"Sumer Is Icumen In) and originals by the film's composer Paul Giovanni (my favourite being the wonderfully bawdy \"The Landlord's Daughter\").<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">Out of everything else, what really sets <i>The Wicker Man</i> apart from horror movies before it is that the film really features no heroes or villains. <i>The Wicker Man</i> does not condemn the inhabitants of Summerisle, nor their particular brand of paganism. At the same time, the film presents Sgt. Howie's Christianity (which at times borders on fanaticism) with respect, condemning neither him nor his faith. Neither the inhabitants of Summerisle nor Sgt. Howie are held up to ridicule, In the hands of lesser filmmakers, either Lord Summerisle or Sgt. Howie would have been portrayed simply as villains.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, none of this would have worked without strong leads. Sir Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward were both masters of their craft, and they both give incredible performances in <i>The Wicker Man</i>. Edward Woodward portrays Sgt. Howie as a deeply religious man, so much so that he could even be considered a fanatic. Despite this, he remains a sympathetic figure, a man who truly cares about his fellow human beings. As portrayed by Sir Christopher Lee, Lord Summerisle is easy going and very open minded, yet at the same time he is as devoted to paganism as Sgt. Howie is to Christianity. Indeed, among the great things about <i>The Wicker Man</i> are the exchanges between Sgt. Howie and Lord Summerisle. Both men are allowed to express their beliefs without either one of them coming off badly. As portrayed by Messrs. Lee and Woodward, Lord Summerisle and Sgt. Howie are equals in every way, and it is up to the audience to decide who they think is right or wrong.<br /><br /><style=\"text-align: left;\">It has been nearly fifty years since <i>The Wicker Man</i> was first released. In that time it has gone from a film that was treated poorly by its production company and distributors to a cult film to a film not only widely considered a classic, but one of the greatest films ever made. Sir Christopher Lee considered it his favourite film, and it is easy to see why.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://weegiemidget.wordpress.com/2021/05/21/day-1-christopher-lee/\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"425\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JdzD6fP5MC0/YKb9NzuJN6I/AAAAAAAFwWk/kdYUEX28oiI2Ccw_zwOYZw3nvUspBl5uwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/christopher-lee-blogathon_2-e1615041605106.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><div style='clear: both;'></div></div><div class='post-footer'><div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-1'><span class='post-author vcard'>Scribbled by<span class='fn' itemprop='author' itemscope='itemscope' itemtype='http://schema.org/Person'><meta content='https://www.blogger.com/profile/18397088843628331615' itemprop='url'/><a href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/18397088843628331615' rel='author' title='author profile'><span itemprop='name'>Terence Towles Canote</span></a></span></span><span class='post-timestamp'>at<meta content='http://mercurie.blogspot.com/2021/05/an-appointment-with-wicker-man-1973.html' itemprop='url'/><a class='timestamp-link' href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/2021/05/an-appointment-with-wicker-man-1973.html' rel='bookmark' title='permanent link'><abbr class='published' itemprop='datePublished' title='2021-05-21T00:01:00-05:00'>12:01 AM</abbr></a></span><span class='post-comment-link'><a class='comment-link' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7210602&postID=4075774222349361056' onclick=''>9 comments:  </a></span><span class='post-icons'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1925572354'><a href='https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=7210602&postID=4075774222349361056&from=pencil' title='Edit Post'><img alt='' class='icon-action' height='18' src='https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif' width='18'/></a></span></span><div class='post-share-buttons goog-inline-block'><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-email' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=4075774222349361056&target=email' target='_blank' title='Email This'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Email This</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=4075774222349361056&target=blog' onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\");

The cause was complications from diabetes.<br /><br />Lloyd Price was born on March 9 1933 in Kenner, Louisiana. As a child he sang in his church's choir and he had lessons in playing both the trumpet and the piano. He played in a music group in high school. In 1952 Art Rupe of Specialty Records, visited New Orleans in search of music artists there. After hearing Lloyd Price's song \"Lawdy Miss Clawdy,\" the song was recorded and released on Specialty Records. It became Lloyd Price's first hit, reaching no. 1 on the <i>Billboard </i>R&amp;B chart. Lloyd Price followed it with four more hits on the <i>Billboard </i>R&amp;B chart, \"Oooh, Oooh, Oooh,\" \"Restless Heart,\" \"Ain't It a Shame,\" and \"Tell Me Pretty Baby.\"<br /><br />In 1954 Lloyd Price was drafted into the United States Army and served in Korea during the Korean War. Unfortunately, after he was demobilized, he would not have another hit for some time. He formed KRC Records with Harold Logan and Bill Boskent. His first single on the new label would also be his first hit in years. \"Just Because\" went to no. 29 on the <i>Billboard</i> singles chart and no. 3 on the <i>Billboard </i>R&amp;B chart. In 1958 he would have his biggest hit, his version of the folk song \"Stagger Lee,\" which went to no. 1 on the <i>Billboard&nbsp; </i>Hot 100 and&nbsp; no. 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> R&amp;B chart. It was not long afterwards that he would have another huge hit with \"Personality,\" which went to no. 2 on the <i>Billboard </i>Hot 100 and no. 1 on the R&amp;B chart. \"I'm Gonna Get Married\" would also prove to be a hit, going to no. 3 on the <i>Billboard </i>Hot 100 and no. 1 on the <i>Billboard </i>R&amp;B chart.<br /><br />Lloyd Price would continue to have hits from the late Fifties into the Sixties. In 1962 he formed Double L. Records with Harold Logan. During the Sixties his only major hit would be \"Misty\" in 1963, which went to no. 21 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Following the murder of his partner in Double L. Records, Harold Logan, in 1969, he founded the label Turntable.<br /><br />Lloyd Price continued to release albums into the 21st Century, his last album being <i>I'm Feeling Good!</i> in 2012. He was also an entrepreneur. In addition to the labels he founded, he founded a club called Birdland with Harold Logan in New York City. He helped boxing promoter Don King promote fights. He managed the food company Global Icon Brands and also owned two construction companies. Lloyd Price continued to tour. In 1993 he toured Europe with Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. In 2005 he toured as part of the Four Kings of Rhythm and Blues tour with Jerry Butler, Ben E. King, and Gene Chandler.<br /><br />Lloyd Price was a true pioneer. His song \"Lady Miss Clawdy\" was one of the first songs to break down barriers between Black and white music, paving the way for rock and roll. His further hits, such as \"Oooh, Oooh, Oooh\" and \"Restless Heart,\" would further integrate music. Along with Little Richard, a good argument can be made that Lloyd Price was pivotal in the development of rock 'n' roll. In addition to being a music pioneer, Lloyd Price was an immensely talented singer, delivering powerful vocals on his songs.<div style='clear: both;'></div></div><div class='post-footer'><div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-1'><span class='post-author vcard'>Scribbled by<span class='fn' itemprop='author' itemscope='itemscope' itemtype='http://schema.org/Person'><meta content='https://www.blogger.com/profile/18397088843628331615' itemprop='url'/><a href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/18397088843628331615' rel='author' title='author profile'><span itemprop='name'>Terence Towles Canote</span></a></span></span><span class='post-timestamp'>at<meta content='http://mercurie.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-late-great-lloyd-price.html' itemprop='url'/><a class='timestamp-link' href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-late-great-lloyd-price.html' rel='bookmark' title='permanent link'><abbr class='published' itemprop='datePublished' title='2021-05-17T18:28:00-05:00'>6:28 PM</abbr></a></span><span class='post-comment-link'><a class='comment-link' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1623289770611525315' onclick=''>No comments:  </a></span><span class='post-icons'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1925572354'><a href='https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1623289770611525315&from=pencil' title='Edit Post'><img alt='' class='icon-action' height='18' src='https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif' width='18'/></a></span></span><div class='post-share-buttons goog-inline-block'><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-email' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1623289770611525315&target=email' target='_blank' title='Email This'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Email This</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1623289770611525315&target=blog' onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target='_blank' title='BlogThis!'><span class='share-button-link-text'>BlogThis!</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1623289770611525315&target=twitter' target='_blank' title='Share to Twitter'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Share to Twitter</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1623289770611525315&target=facebook' onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target='_blank' title='Share to Facebook'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Share to Facebook</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-pinterest' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1623289770611525315&target=pinterest' target='_blank' title='Share to Pinterest'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Share to Pinterest</span></a></div></div><div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-2'><span class='post-labels'></span></div><div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-3'><span class='post-location'></span></div></div></div></div>          </div></div>                  <div class=\"date-outer\">        <h2 class='date-header'><span>Saturday, May 15, 2021</span></h2>          <div class=\"date-posts\">        <div class='post-outer'><div class='post hentry' itemprop='blogPost' itemscope='itemscope' itemtype='http://schema.org/BlogPosting'><meta content='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FCPutYaGFlE/hqdefault.jpg' itemprop='image_url'/><meta content='7210602' itemprop='blogId'/><meta content='410030124509395575' itemprop='postId'/><a name='410030124509395575'></a><h3 class='post-title entry-title' itemprop='name'><a href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/2021/05/stagger-lee-by-lloyd-price.html'>\"Stagger Lee\" by Lloyd Price</a></h3><div class='post-header'><div class='post-header-line-1'></div></div><div class='post-body entry-content' id='post-body-410030124509395575' itemprop='description articleBody'>The great Lloyd Price died on May 3.

I realize that 106 is a ripe old age to live to. I realize that Mr. Lloyd had a full life, appearing on Broadway, in film, on radio, and on television. His career lasted nearly 90 years and his marriage to his beloved wife Peggy lasted 75 years, until her death in 2011. He worked with such legends as Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, and Alfred Hitchcock. Still, in my selfishness I had hoped we might have Norman Lloyd a bit longer. It was not simply because he was a living repository of entertainment history. It was not simply because he was an immensely talented actor and an incredible public speaker. It was because he was an impeccable gentleman filled with congeniality, warmth, and an incredible wit. In some ways he seemed as much like a friend's beloved uncle as he did a legendary star. Indeed, it seems to me that classic film buffs are mourning Norman Lloyd's death much more than many bigger named stars.<br /><br />Norman Lloyd was born Norman Perlmutter on November 8 1914 in Jersey City, New Jersey. He grew up in Brooklyn. His mother loved the theatre, and so she took him to elocution lessons to get rid of his Brooklyn accent. She also enrolled him in lessons for singing and dancing. His debut came when he was still a&nbsp; child, performing \"Father, Get the Hammer, There's a Fly on Baby's Head\" at a local ladies club. As a child he performed in vaudeville and at women's clubs, and he was a professional performer by age nine. He made his debut on Broadway when he was still a teenager, in the play <i>Crime</i> in 1927. At age 15, while still in high school, he had started studies at New York University, but he left after his sophomore year.<br /><br />It was in the early Thirties that he apprenticed with the Civic Repertory Theatre in New York City, the home of the stage company of actress Eva La Gallienne. In 1935 he appeared in the play <i>Noah </i>on Broadway. He acted as part of the Work Progress Administration's Federal Theatre Project. This included&nbsp; the Living Newspaper Unit of the Federal Theatre Project of the WPA, which dramatized current affairs. He appeared in the Living Newspaper Unit's production of <i>Power</i> on Broadway in 1937. He met Orson Welles and John Houseman trough the Living Newspaper Unit, and they asked him to join their new acting company, the Mercury Theatre. He appeared in the Mercury Theatre's 1938 productions <i>Julius Caesar</i> and <i>Shoemaker's Holiday</i>.

He also guest starred on the shows <i>Quincy, M.E.</i>; <i>The Paper Chase</i>; <i>The Twilight Zone</i>;  <i>Murder, She Wrote</i>; and <i>Wiseguy</i>.

From the Naughts into the Teens he appeared in the movies <i>In Her Shows</i> (2005), <i>A Place for Heroes</i> (2014), and <i>Trainwreck</i> (2015).<br /><br />Norman Lloyd worked extensively with Turner Classic Movies. He attended every single TCM Classic Film Festival in Hollywood except one. He also attended the TCM Classic Cruise in 2011 and 2013. Mr. Lloyd was well known for his talent for storytelling as well as his remarkable memory.<br /><br />Norman Lloyd had an utterly unique career. He did nearly everything one could in the entertainment industry. He acted on stage, on radio, on film, and in television. He produced TV shows and TV movies. He directed TV shows and TV movies. What is more, he served as a living repository of information on the entertainment industry during the Golden Age of Hollywood and beyond. Not only was his career remarkably long, perhaps longer than any other performer, but he was also prolific for most of that career.<br /><br />As an actor Norman Lloyd was a singular talent. Throughout his career he gave a number of great performances, beginning with his feature film debut in <i>Saboteur</i>. In Jean Renoir's <i>The Southerner</i> he played the rather odd, somewhat dull nephew of Henry Devers (J. Carroll Naish), Finley. In <i>Spellbound</i> he played Mr. Garmes, one of the inmates at the mental hospital Green Manors. In Charlie Chaplin's <i>Limelight</i> he played Mr. Bodalink, the dance instructor. In <i>Dead Poets Society</i> he played the overly traditional headmaster Gale Nolan. His television performances were no less remarkable than his appearances on film. In the comedic <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents </i>episode \"Design for Loving,\" he played a frustrated husband who gets a robot duplicate of himself to spend time with his wife. In the <i>Murder , She Wrote</i> episode he played an old friend of main character Jessica Fletcher. If Mr. Lloyd is well remembered as Dr. Auschlander on <i>St. Elsewhere</i>, it is not simply because it is one of his later roles, but because he was so very good in it. Norman Lloyd played a wide variety of roles, from those who were mildly neurotic to those who were downright mentally disturbed, from villains to heroes.<br /><br />Of course, Norman Lloyd worked behind the scenes as well. He was an associate producer on <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> and a producer on <i>The Alfred Hitchcock Hour</i>. He directed episodes of everything form <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> to several television movies. And he did all of this while continuing to act.<br /><br />Norman Lloyd is being mourned by the classic film community in a way usually reserved for much bigger names. This is not because he worked with some of the biggest names in film history or even because he was one of the last ties to the Golden Age of Hollywood. It is because he was such a remarkable man. He worked extensively with TCM and it was not unusual to see him a the TCM Classic Film Festival. As someone who was a regular at the TCM Classic Film Festival, I then have several friends who had the opportunity to meet him in person. Every single one of them said the same thing. Norman Lloyd was congenial and charming, and possessed a great sense of humour and an incredible wit. He was a man who realized his fans loved him and who loved them back. In the end, Norman Lloyd was not simply an incredible talent with a remarkably long and diverse career, he was a true gentleman well known for his friendliness and kindness. For that TCM fans and classic film buffs will miss him.<div style='clear: both;'></div></div><div class='post-footer'><div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-1'><span class='post-author vcard'>Scribbled by<span class='fn' itemprop='author' itemscope='itemscope' itemtype='http://schema.org/Person'><meta content='https://www.blogger.com/profile/18397088843628331615' itemprop='url'/><a href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/18397088843628331615' rel='author' title='author profile'><span itemprop='name'>Terence Towles Canote</span></a></span></span><span class='post-timestamp'>at<meta content='http://mercurie.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-late-great-norman-lloyd.html' itemprop='url'/><a class='timestamp-link' href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-late-great-norman-lloyd.html' rel='bookmark' title='permanent link'><abbr class='published' itemprop='datePublished' title='2021-05-13T17:13:00-05:00'>5:13 PM</abbr></a></span><span class='post-comment-link'><a class='comment-link' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7210602&postID=9011259601597176254' onclick=''>No comments:  </a></span><span class='post-icons'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1925572354'><a href='https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=7210602&postID=9011259601597176254&from=pencil' title='Edit Post'><img alt='' class='icon-action' height='18' src='https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif' width='18'/></a></span></span><div class='post-share-buttons goog-inline-block'><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-email' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=9011259601597176254&target=email' target='_blank' title='Email This'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Email This</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=9011259601597176254&target=blog' onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target='_blank' title='BlogThis!'><span class='share-button-link-text'>BlogThis!</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=9011259601597176254&target=twitter' target='_blank' title='Share to Twitter'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Share to Twitter</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=9011259601597176254&target=facebook' onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target='_blank' title='Share to Facebook'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Share to Facebook</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-pinterest' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=9011259601597176254&target=pinterest' target='_blank' title='Share to Pinterest'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Share to Pinterest</span></a></div></div><div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-2'><span class='post-labels'></span></div><div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-3'><span class='post-location'></span></div></div></div></div>          </div></div>                  <div class=\"date-outer\">        <h2 class='date-header'><span>Monday, May 10, 2021</span></h2>          <div class=\"date-posts\">        <div class='post-outer'><div class='post hentry' itemprop='blogPost' itemscope='itemscope' itemtype='http://schema.org/BlogPosting'><meta content='https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KMwrAX6UBp8/YJmjW5msJxI/AAAAAAAFwVY/n-6WgTJf8xYlZZqxedqXdKulcKAYDCOUgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/TCM%2BFilm%2BFestival%2B2021.jpg' itemprop='image_url'/><meta content='7210602' itemprop='blogId'/><meta content='1300066161495596363' itemprop='postId'/><a name='1300066161495596363'></a><h3 class='post-title entry-title' itemprop='name'><a href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/2021/05/tcm-classic-film-festival-2021.html'>TCM Classic Film Festival 2021</a></h3><div class='post-header'><div class='post-header-line-1'></div></div><div class='post-body entry-content' id='post-body-1300066161495596363' itemprop='description articleBody'><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KMwrAX6UBp8/YJmjW5msJxI/AAAAAAAFwVY/n-6WgTJf8xYlZZqxedqXdKulcKAYDCOUgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1200/TCM%2BFilm%2BFestival%2B2021.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"628\" data-original-width=\"1200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KMwrAX6UBp8/YJmjW5msJxI/AAAAAAAFwVY/n-6WgTJf8xYlZZqxedqXdKulcKAYDCOUgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/TCM%2BFilm%2BFestival%2B2021.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />The TCM Classic Film Festival 2021 ended last night. Because of the ongoing pandemic, the festival was once again virtual. That having been said, it was a lot of fun and I am sad that it is over.&nbsp;<br /><br />On the Wednesday before opening night, I watched an episode of Hollywood Forever Cemetery tour guide Karie Bible's series<i> Hollywood Kitchen </i>featuring Victoria Mature with her father Victor Mature's recipe for orange bourbon bread pudding. I am a huge fan of Victor Mature and I am fortunate to know both Karie and Victoria, so it was a lot of fun. If you haven't seen Karie's Hollywood Kitchen., you should do so. Episodes are available on YouTube and you can read the blog with the recipes <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodkitchenshow.com/\">here</a>. <br /><br />Part of what made this year's festival fun were the Zoom events they held each day. I was only able to attend one, the Opening Night Toast with the Hosts. The event was hosted by Scott McGee, TCM's Senior Director of Original Programming and included every host of TCM: Ben Mankiewicz, Professor Jacqueline Stewart, Eddie Muller, Alicia Malone, and Dave Karger. It was enjoyable watching the hosts answer various questions, and many of my TCMParty pals were there too. On Wednesday they had a Meet TCM Zoom Event, on Friday they had Curating the Classics, on Saturday they had Sight and Sound Makers: A Chat with Ben Burtt &amp; Craig Barron, and on Sunday She May Be a Movie Star, But She's Just Mom to Me.<br /><br />I do have to say that I wish I had been able to watch more movies during this Festival. It seems that it is harder to work TCM around my schedule in early May than it is mid-April! I did get to see some of my favourite movies. I watched <i>West Side Story</i> (1961) on Thursday. On Friday I watched SF Sketchfest's table read of <i>Plan 9 from Outer Space</i> and then the movie itself. Saturday was the big day for me. I watched the documentary <i>Nichols &amp; May: Take Two</i> Saturday morning. I have been a huge fan of Nichols &amp; May for years. In the afternoon I was the guest host for the TCMParty for <i>Bullitt</i> (1968). It was enjoyable tweeting trivia to the movie. It was made even more enjoyable by Speeding Bullitt, a podcast devoted to Steve McQueen. They tweeted a good deal of additional trivia (I am thinking next time they show <i>Bullitt</i>, they should guest host). Following <i>Bullitt</i> I watched the restoration of <i>They Won't Believe Me</i> (1947). Fifteen minutes that had been cut from the film were restored, using the original nitrate of the film to do so. The live tweet on TCMParty for <i>They Won't Believe Me</i> was hosted by the Czar of Noir himself, Eddie Muller. The last film I watched during the festival was <i>I Remember Mama</i> (1949). It is nearly the perfect movie for Mother's Day. An additional treat was that prior to the movie they aired one of Robert Osborne's old intros for the film.<br /><br />Next year's TCM Classic Film Festival should be in person in Hollywood again. I am hoping that next year I will be able to attend it for the first time.&nbsp; That having been said, I have enjoyed both last year and this year's virtual festivals. Both were very enjoyable and it is always fun to take part in events with one's fellow TCM fans.<div style='clear: both;'></div></div><div class='post-footer'><div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-1'><span class='post-author vcard'>Scribbled by<span class='fn' itemprop='author' itemscope='itemscope' itemtype='http://schema.org/Person'><meta content='https://www.blogger.com/profile/18397088843628331615' itemprop='url'/><a href='https://www.blogger.com/profile/18397088843628331615' rel='author' title='author profile'><span itemprop='name'>Terence Towles Canote</span></a></span></span><span class='post-timestamp'>at<meta content='http://mercurie.blogspot.com/2021/05/tcm-classic-film-festival-2021.html' itemprop='url'/><a class='timestamp-link' href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/2021/05/tcm-classic-film-festival-2021.html' rel='bookmark' title='permanent link'><abbr class='published' itemprop='datePublished' title='2021-05-10T16:20:00-05:00'>4:20 PM</abbr></a></span><span class='post-comment-link'><a class='comment-link' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1300066161495596363' onclick=''>No comments:  </a></span><span class='post-icons'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1925572354'><a href='https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1300066161495596363&from=pencil' title='Edit Post'><img alt='' class='icon-action' height='18' src='https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif' width='18'/></a></span></span><div class='post-share-buttons goog-inline-block'><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-email' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1300066161495596363&target=email' target='_blank' title='Email This'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Email This</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-blog' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1300066161495596363&target=blog' onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=270,width=475\"); return false;' target='_blank' title='BlogThis!'><span class='share-button-link-text'>BlogThis!</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-twitter' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1300066161495596363&target=twitter' target='_blank' title='Share to Twitter'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Share to Twitter</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-facebook' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1300066161495596363&target=facebook' onclick='window.open(this.href, \"_blank\", \"height=430,width=640\"); return false;' target='_blank' title='Share to Facebook'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Share to Facebook</span></a><a class='goog-inline-block share-button sb-pinterest' href='https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=7210602&postID=1300066161495596363&target=pinterest' target='_blank' title='Share to Pinterest'><span class='share-button-link-text'>Share to Pinterest</span></a></div></div><div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-2'><span class='post-labels'></span></div><div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-3'><span class='post-location'></span></div></div></div></div>        </div></div>      </div><div class='blog-pager' id='blog-pager'><span id='blog-pager-newer-link'><a class='blog-pager-newer-link' href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2021-06-03T18:01:00-05:00&amp;max-results=7&amp;reverse-paginate=true' id='Blog1_blog-pager-newer-link' title='Newer Posts'>Newer Posts</a></span><span id='blog-pager-older-link'><a class='blog-pager-older-link' href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2021-05-10T16:20:00-05:00&amp;max-results=7&amp;start=651&amp;by-date=false' id='Blog1_blog-pager-older-link' title='Older Posts'>Older Posts</a></span><a class='home-link' href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/'>Home</a></div><div class='clear'></div><div class='blog-feeds'><div class='feed-links'>Subscribe to:<a class='feed-link' href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default' target='_blank' type='application/atom+xml'>Posts (Atom)</a></div></div></div></div></div><!-- end main-wrapper --><!-- start right-sidebar-wrapper --><div class='sidebar' id='right-sidebar-wrapper'><div class='sidebar2 section' id='sidebar2'><div class='widget FeaturedPost' data-version='1' id='FeaturedPost1'><h2 class='title'>Featured Post</h2><div class='post-summary'><h3><a href='https://mercurie.blogspot.com/2020/07/justice-for-vanessa-marquez.html'>Justice for Vanessa Marquez </a></h3><p>Vanessa Marquez was an actress best known for playing Ana Delgado in the classic movie Stand and Deliver (1988) and Nurse Wendy Goldman on t...</p><img class='image' src='https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tlhAQXNwYu4/YO-FZOxCCbI/AAAAAAAFwqM/0LzMr74CgZE3hDr4I8PdEYkjnUNAgfdaACLcBGAsYHQ/w200-h200/31-vanessa-marquez.w330.h330.jpg'/></div><style type='text/css'>    .image {      width: 100%;    }"}
