{"title": "My year in projects", "date": "Monday 1 January 2024", "text": "Happy New Year!  Lets hope its a good one for all.I wanted to write a post over the Christmas period but I came down with Covid the day after my birthday then spent the next two day in bed.  It wiped me out for a couple of days, thankfully I feel better now.  The symptoms were not like I had before, I was congested with a tickly cough for a couple of days but I didn't lose my sense of taste or smell, I was however really exhausted, then by last night all my symptoms seemed to disappear, just as quick as they came.   I will test again in a couple of days to make sure I'm negative before I go anywhere near people, I know there are relaxed rules now but I still don't think it's fair to pass it on knowingly, you never know what health issues other people are dealing with do you?My middle daughter Joanne also tested positive with the same symptoms as me although, she still has quite a cough but, surprisingly neither Mark or any of the rest of the family that were here over Christmas has had it.Anyway, on to the makes......These are my last finishes for this year end, one pair of Christmas socks and the last stitched piece for the Stick6in2023 I ran out of time to complete my socks to wear on Christmas Eve but I did finish them on Boxing Day, so still classed as a Christmas finish.  They are knitted in the Vintage Tinsel colourway by West Yorkshire Spinners.  This was their Christmas colourway from 2021, back then It didn't really appeal to me, then I saw someone knitting it up this year and thought It was beautiful, funny how we change our minds isn't it?I used Amethyst, also by WYS, for the heels and toes and I love them!  You can't really see from the photo how sparkly they are, but take my word they do sparkle :-)My Stick6in2023 piece for the months of November and December was finished just in the nick of time.  I must confess that I didn't much enjoy stitching this one, hence the amount of time It took me to finish.  Those snowflakes were a pain in the butt and I struggled to see, even with my magnifier, the 32 count fabric.  Still, It's done now and I love the way it came out.  What you can't really tell from the photo is that the fabric I stitched on was blue and the finishing fabric is navy blue velour.When I think of Winter by Puntini PuntiniI've really enjoyed taking part in this SAL hosted my Martina and Manuela, amazingly I managed to complete all six parts!   I'm already looking forward to joining in throughout 2024, thanks ladies for hosting.*****************Now that I've shared my end of year finishes it's time for a round up of everything I made during the rest of 2023.There were ten pairs of socks Three sewing finishes, (I made two of the bags, one for Bonnie and one for her friend)Two baby blanketsTwelve stitched finishesTwo jumpersOne cardiganFour forgotten projects finished off, two were baby cardigans, one was crochet blanket and of course Albert the rabbit :-)And last but not least, because they will be the most used, Thirteen dishcloths!Phew! I stitched more in 2023 than I have for a few years and I really enjoyed all my projects, well except for the last one, lol.  I'll share some plans I have for 2024 another time as this post has gone on long enough, and If you are still here at this point, thank you for reading👍   I'll say goodnight and leave you with a photo of my Winter bowl, the idea for which I shamelessly stole from the lovely Carol over at Stitching Dreams, I hope you don't mind my friend 😉 -X-"},
{"title": "Well that was something different :-)", "date": "Thursday 28 December 2023", "text": "Yesterday was my birthday and one of the gifts from my girls was a Bake Off experience.Now I have only every watched one series of  Bake Off, I don't like cooking shows in general so when they told me we were going to be partaking in a Bake Off I was a bit dubious, as it turned out it was good fun 😁The tent was set out as in the show and all the ingredients for the cake we were making was set out together with instructions.  We were on a time limit, just as the contestants of the show are, which I have to say is a bit nerve wracking, even though ours was for fun, you can imagine how the real contestants are put under pressure.Our instructions were to make a three tier cake with meringue buttercream icing, a white chocolate Iglu, plus figures to sit in the Iglu.  I had never made meringue buttercream or any form made from chocolate, but the instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I teamed up with Joanne and Stevie and Jenny paired up, this Is the cake Joanne and myself made.And a closer look at our figures, which Joanne made, I think she did a great job with them!Our sponge was almond flavour with salted caramel flavour frosting tinged with blue colouring, coconut for snow and silver ballsHere is Jenny and Stevie's creation.Their sponge was flavoured with almond and the buttercream with black cherry and decorated with coconut for snow and flaked almonds.Time for the judging by the head baker,We all had to carry our cakes to the front, just like the show, they are not allowed to taste so the cakes were judged on appearance and decoration.  So now would you like to know who won?Well the winner was actually really good but then she revealed that two of the bakers were actually sort of semi pro, one of them worked at the place and another worked at a bakery, there were four in their team too.   I didn't get a photo of it but It's the cake on the back row, second in from the left.  Love how they did two tone buttercream.BUT....Mine and Joanne's cake was awarded 2nd placeStevie and Jenny were awarded 3rd place.I'm very happy with that result 😁I had lots of other lovely presents, including this one from my good friend JoJo also gifted me these gorgeous goodies for Christmas.Thank you so much Jo, I love everything 😍  I've been wanting some stitch stoppers for a while and can't wait to put these into use.Today I'm doing very little, I've stitched a bit, caught up with Call The Midwife and had some home made soup for lunch, the first proper meal I've eaten since Christmas Day, I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been fueled by chocolate, mince pies and left overs in the last few days, ha ha.  I promised myself that I would go for some long walks to compensate, but the weather has been atrocious, the wind if fierce and the rain none stop and as much as I would like to get out I'm averse to getting wet and wind- swept, lol.Hope you all had a lovely Christmas and enjoying these days in-between doing whatever it is you want to do.-X-"},
{"title": "All is Calm", "date": "Sunday 24 December 2023", "text": "After all the hustle and bustle of the last few weeks today has been surprisingly calm and relaxed.  I was up fairly early and made the stollen for the girls, It's become a bit of a tradition now that I make them gingerbread granola and stollen at Christmas.  I made the granola a couple of days ago and that Is already in their hampers with their other gifts.  I also made some rustic looking sausage rolls, one batch with cranberry and one with caramelised onions, my taste tester tells me they are lovely despite their rustic appearance, lolMy Christmas cake is all ready too, I used Delia's Christmas cake recipe but instead of buying and soaking all the fruit I used a premade fruit/brandy mix from Lidl.  I did the same last year and it turned out lovely, fingers crossed this is too.We had a couple of birthdays this week, my youngest grandson, Jacob, turned 4 on Thursday and my eldest daughter, Jenny turned 41 on Friday.  For Jacobs birthday Joanne had booked tickets for Winter Glow at the Three Counties Showground in Malvern.  We were all looking forward to seeing the lights and getting into the Christmas spirit, but it wasn't to be.  For a few days the weather has been very windy and because of that they had closed the light trail and the fairground.  Supposedly they had sent out emails but some didn't receive any notification that it had been closed.  We were told that we could exchange out tickets and go ice skating or perhaps come back over Christmas as the Winter Glow was on until January 6th.  It had taken us just over an hour to get there so we decided to give ice-skating a go. The kids enjoyed it, Bonnie was a bit nervous at first but she was ok after we'd been round a couple of times, just a shame we couldn't see the lights.Jean, who blogs at shrimptonandperfect recently had a giveaway on her blog and I won!I was so surprised when I read my name as the winner on her blog, It came at the right time to cheer me up too.And look what came, a lovely card, book and christmas tree broach.Isn't it pretty?  I'll be wearing this on Christmas day, thank you so much Jean :-)  I shall enjoy the book in the new year.Well that's about it for now, I haven't done much blog reading over the last couple of weeks, Ill try and catch up on all your goings on in the next few days, There will be five, (mabe six) here for dinner tomorrow, Stevie, Darren, Joanne, me and Mark.  Stevie called to say that one of Darren's brothers is on his own tomorrow and could he come too, there's plenty to go round so that's ok.  Bonnie and Jacob are going to their dads to eat and then will come here late afternoon,  Jenny, James and the boys are eating at home and coming here in the afternoon too.  I'm really looking forward to the day now.Hope you all have a wonderful Christmas-X-"},
{"title": "flat out and in need of a break", "date": "Monday 18 December 2023", "text": "Things have been so busy here with none Christmasy stuff that I haven't had time to enjoy anything Christmas related, and now we are steaming away towards the main event!   Ugh, it just feels like a slog this year, that's the way it goes sometimes though.Finally we managed to get the bedroom decorating all done, the carpet was fitted last Tuesday and I have been working my way through sorting and putting stuff back the rest of the week, the furniture had to wait until Saturday when Mark was home to put things back together.  Still have the curtains to put back up, that won't happen until Friday as they are still at the drycleaners, but at least everything now looks fresh and clean. My middle daughter, Joanne moved house on December 1st so that was all hands on deck to help with the move and since then I've been going to hers most nights to help sort and put things in order.   It's been a long and emotional two years for her, (and for us too at times), but now, finally, she can start a new life, just her, Bonnie and Jacob.There hasn't been a lot of time for crafting over the last couple of weeks but I did make time to sit down yesterday afternoon and finish another one of my forgotten projects.This is Albert, (looking a little grumpy)I'd purchased the kit for Albert when I went to Wool@J13 in 2019, I knitted both the back and front body parts fairly quickly after that, then everything got put away so there was still a fair bit of knitting to do to get him done.  I'm glad to have another project crossed off my list, although I may knit him another scarf, I think this one is a bit shortI've knitted two of these kits by Sardines For Tea now, I made the smaller Arthur rabbit for my grandson Arthur in 2020 which you can see here. I've crossed all the jobs off my list for today so I'm going to give myself the rest of the day off, once I've clicked publish on this post I'm making myself a coffee and plonking myself on the sofa, putting a film on and stitching, and I'm NOT going to feel guilty about it, lolSee you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Are you Ready for December?", "date": "Sunday 3 December 2023", "text": "Well December 1st came around so quickly didn't? It? And Christmas is just around the corner.  I still have presents to buy, but strangely, I'm not stressing about It this year.  Usually by now I would be worrying about that, not this year.A lot of my extra food shopping is done, I start putting bits away at the beginning of September, easier on the purse, saves all the panic buying and means I can put away things that we usually eat which might disappear from the shelves to make way for all the fancy, (and over priced), Christmas food. All that should be left to shop for in the last few days before Christmas are the fresh things.I put the tree up last week, It's been lovely having the lights on especially as the days have been quite dark recently, makes the house look all cosy.I'll post a close up of some of my stitched ornaments closer to Christmas, only a couple of new ones this year though.This morning I've changed the bedding over for Christmas too.  I've only been using Christmas bedding for two or three years but I do really like it, I've got a few to choose from now, this one is new.  I tried to buy It last year but everyone had sold out, I managed to find it in stock at Wayfair this year.  Love the little houses.I didn't purchase any yarn advents this year.   I already have so many mini skeins and I just couldn't justify spending that much money with no plan for using the yarn.  I will enjoy watching everyone else open their yarn advents though, either on blogs or through the many you tube channels I watch :-)Something I did decide to do was cast on some Christmas socks on December 1st.Hopefully they will be finished ready for me to wear on Christmas day.This is the Vintage Tinsel colourway from West Yorkshire Spinners,  It's knitting up so lovely and is so sparkly, not sure you can see that from the photoIt turned really cold for a few days, and we had our first frost. a couple of days it was -4°, today it's all change again and we have rain.The garden on the whole looks pretty bleak at this time of year but I couldn't resist taking a few photos on those frosty mornings, It makes some things look so pretty.I wonder If this poor spider was as frozen as his web!I had hoped to finish another abandoned project last week but I didn't have a lot of crafting time, there is only a little sewing up to do on it so It should be finished by the next time I post.Next week Is another busy one, I have various grandchildren for three days and somehow have to fit in painting a bedroom as well - No rest for the wicked 😉See you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Catch up on last weeks happenings", "date": "Friday 24 November 2023", "text": "I mentioned previously that I wanted to get some projects that had been abandoned finished before the end of the year.  I chose two last week that had the least amount to work on to call them finished.  The white cardigan is the Jasmine Baby Jacket, which only needed the buttons sewing on.  The pink cardigan is the  Puerperium Cardigan, all that needed doing on this one was the edging on the sleeves and to sew buttons on.Both cardigan patterns are free and can be found on Ravelry.This week I chose something else to try and finish and hopefully I will have that completed to show you next time.I have also been working a little on my mitred square blanket.This is a long term project and won't be finished anytime soon, but that's ok, I love working on it and I have plenty more mini skeins to choose from.  Mine and Jacobs's outing last week was to a local canal trust which have toddler boat trips each Wednesday morning  for £1, well you can't get much for £1 these days so we had to give it a go.   The trip is just half an hour with songs along the way to keep the children entertained whilst the boat travels along the canal and through a couple of tunnels.  Afterwards there are some crafty activities in the cafe.  It was something different and Jacob seemed to enjoy his trip on the banooke.  ( A Banooke is Jacobs word for a barge, we have no idea why, perhaps a combination of canal boat and barge and his little mind came up with the word Banooke 😆 )Later in the afternoon we made gingerbread men, one had an accident, oh dear, lolThis week I took him to a local playcentre called Little Lobsters.  It's much nicer than the big indoor playcentres, everything is in one big room and is more geared to imaginative play with different sections of play such as construction, a shop, kitchen, dressing up as well as a ball pit, slide and various ride on toys.   All the children are called together at the end of the session for a sing-a-long, It's definitely somewhere I'll take him again, especially if the weather isn't good. Last Sunday I had a day out to the Festive Gift Fair at the NEC with Joanne and Stevie and Bonnie.  Compared to previous years It wasn't so good, there were a lot of stands selling the same sort of things, a bit disappointing really.  The girls bought a couple of things, I came home with nothing, that must be a first, there just wasn't anything that took my fancy.  The Grinch made an appearance though and Joanne queued for Bonnie to have a photo.Well I think that's me just about caught up on what's been happening here.  Last week Mark started the preparation to decorated the back bedroom so new wallpaper will be going up tomorrow, I said I would paint the ceiling so that he can just get straight on with it in the morning. Everything takes so much longer because he only has the weekend, but at least the bedroom isn't needed so I can shut the door on the chaos while It's going on.See you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Six day socks and other goings on", "date": "Monday 13 November 2023", "text": "These socks were knitted up really quickly, well six days is quick for me anyway.  To be fair I didn't really pick up any other crafting that week and, they were a smaller size.These are for my middle daughter, she is only a shoe size 5, the rest of us have big feet, lol.I'm making the girls a pamper hamper for Christmas so these will go into her basket with the other goodies.  The yarn is probably one of the longest I've had in my stash, it's Drop Fabel, I can't remember the colourway but It was nice to knit with and I like the way they came out.I mentioned last time trying to finish off some projects so last week I pulled out my Tresaco Jumper.  This is the second time I've knitted the Trescao pattern, It's really simple and easy to knit, only problem is all that stocking stitch can get a little monotonous, I think that's why It got abandoned.  There was very little work to do on it, half a sleeve and a cuff and It was done. I used Stylecraft Recreate yarn, again I'm not sure of the colourway but it was the lightest grey in that range.Each Wednesday now I will be looking after Jacob.  Joanne asked me a while ago as It would mean that the remaining days he is at nursery they can take advantage of the free hours that the Government offer.  Nursery fees are so expensive and although free hours are offered from age two, there are conditions.  If you don't work you can get free nursery hours, you can also get free hours If you are claiming certain benefits and earn below a certain amount, but If you work and earn just a fraction over that amount you have to pay the full whack.  It's crazy.Anyway, Last Wednesday the weather wasn't too good so we didn't go far just a visit to the library and then we had a day of baking.  Jacob loves to cook, he even like to wash up afterwards 😆 And I'm all for encouraging that.He made Millies cookies, and he really did make them with only a little bit of help from me, look how pleased he is with them 💗Later we made the Christmas cake.  More help needed from me for this one, and making sure that he didn't try to sample the brandy infused cake batter!Hope It tastes as good as it looks come Christmas.Hope you all have a good week, see you soon.-X-"},
{"title": "Catch up for October finishes", "date": "Tuesday 7 November 2023", "text": "I'm late in posting finishes for October, there were two, one knitted, one stitched, both were finished a couple of weeks ago but for some reason I've lacked the motivation to, (a) take photos and (b) write a blog post.  But I'm here now so lets get on with it.My stitching finish is my piece for the Stick6in23, a year long SAL which is hosted by Martina and Manuela  Promise of Spring by Silver Creek SamplersThe frame is just one off the shelf from The Range, I'm not too sure about it now but I can take the stitching out if I change my mind and see something else.  This one is stitched on 32 count with the recommended threads.There is just one more chart to stitch in November and December for this SAL, the number 5 was generated for the last two months, happily mine is a smaller one this time so it should be easier to complete, even with the busyness of December.Another SAL is in the planning for next year and I shall definitely join in, I've loved every minute of this years.My knitted finish is another pair of socks, these are for my son in law, James.  He is a shoe size 10 so these are too big for my sock blockers!  The yarn is Stylecraft Head Over Heels and was a gift from my friend Jo last year.  I think they knitted up lovely. I want November to be a month of finishing things off.  I have a few things that don't require much attention to call them done, one of them has already been completed, hopefully I can keep it going.October is the start of the Winter birthdays, Oliver turned 11 on October 17th.  I went with them to Pizza Hut on his birthday and on the weekend he and a few friends went to Laser Quest and he had a friend stay for a sleepover.  Mark also had a birthday on 21st.Last week was half term here, I only had the boys one day as Jenny was off work, there were Halloween activities at a local library so we went there along with Joanne, Bonnie and Jacob.They spent a good few hours gluing, sticking and painting.As it was a reasonable day weatherwise we decide to walk to the library via our local park, It was before we had all the heavy rain and the colours were amazing.Had a toadstool hunt but these were the most interesting we found.Halloween was wet and windy and we didn't get any visitors, Joanne took Bonnie and Jacob to trick or treat with Oliver and Arty, there are more children on their estate and some of the houses make a real effort with decorating.  Jenny didn't send me any photos of the boys dressed up this time but here are Bonnie and Jacob and the pumpkins they carved.That's me all caught up for now, hopefully I can get another post in before the end of the month to report how my project finishing is going.to-X-PS. Thank you to all who commented on my last post about the passing of my brother in law.  The funereal went as well as these things can, the crematorium was packed, a testament to how well he was liked.  My sister is doing well, considering, I think she did a lot of her grieving in the last four months they had together, I know they talked and cried together a lot in that time.  Of course she is going to miss him terribly, they were together from when she was 15 and he 16, there is a huge gap in her life which will she will never be able to fill again, but, she has to go on, and she will."},
{"title": "Go faster stripes", "date": "Wednesday 11 October 2023", "text": "The weeks and months are going so fast that I can hardly keep up, so I'd better share what I managed to complete in September before we get any further into October!It was all about the stripy sock this time, somehow they seem to knit up quicker, they don't of course, It just that there is a little more interest.  These blue ones are in the West Yorkshire Sprinner colourway Blue Lagoon.They were intended for my youngest daughter, but they turned out a little big for, however, they fit Mark perfectly.  I've wanted to try Opal yarn for a while but can't find any in local shops, I did find some a few months ago in a little shop in Stroud, two balls came home with me and I have to say that I much prefer It to WYS.I also finished a little crib blanket in September, no reason for knitting it other than I wanted to knit something plain and simple and this fitted the bill.  It'll be tucked away and be ready to gift at a future date.Lastly I stitched up another little Autumn pillow.  This one is by Puntini PuntiniI love the little spider and the black cat That's all my crafty endeavours for September, I'm not feeling the urge to stitch or knit much at the moment so there might not be a lot to show for October makes, although On Sunday I am going to a stitching day retreat so perhaps that will inspire and motivate me.Some sad news to end on -After a short illness my brother in-law, (my eldest sisters husband) passed away in the early hours of Sunday morning.  He will be missed very much, not only by my sister, his children and grandchildren but by extended family too, I can't remember a time when he wasn't there.   They are both quite a few years older than me and have been together since they were 14 so I would have been about 2 years old then, It's going to be so strange to think he's not there. My sister is doing ok at the moment, dreading the funeral of course, but there are things that have to be done to keep her going at the moment, It will be afterwards that will be the hardest for her.Until next time-X-"},
{"title": "Full on Autumn", "date": "Sunday 24 September 2023", "text": "The weather has taken a turn after all that sunny weather of a few weeks ago, it is now feels well and truly like Autumn.  I absolutely love this time of year, well, except for the rain that is, but on Saturday the weather stayed dry and sunny for our visit to the Autumn Show at the Three Counties Show Ground in Malvern.  This is the second year we have visited the show and we enjoyed it as much as we did our first visit.The vintage caravans were there once again, In smaller numbers I think this year, but they were still lovely to see and all look so cosy inside.  This one even had a bow window with leaded panes,One of the things I love seeing is all the giant vegetables, although this year must not have been such a good year for growing pumpkins as the winning ones weren't as big as last years winner.  Still impressive nonetheless.Will you look at the size of the winning marrow! 70.7kg.That's 155 lb or 11st 13lbI've no idea if they grow these especially for these shows or if they are a fluke, either way that's a monster of a marrow!The winning flowers, I do love a dahlia, but again, not as many on show as last yearThere were all the same sorts of traders as last year as well as gardening talks cooking demos and stalls selling a variety of items, garden related, gifts and clothes too.  The tickets are not cheap, (£20 if you pay in advance, £25 on the day) but It Is a whole day out and there is a lot to see, so good value I suppose.While we were in the middle of the heatwave at the beginning of September I couldn't wait to create my own little Autumn celebration in a tiered tray.   My first attempt at this and I'm rather pleased with it.  I've included some close ups of the pillows, Pumpkin Spice Everything and Welcome Autumn were finishes from this year, Pumpkin Spice Farm Is a finish from a few year ago.Dream by Cottage Garden Samplings and Quaker Pumpkins drum sit on my mantle in the sitting roomThis time next week will be October 1st, honestly, where does the time go? It's going to be a busy last week of the month but hopefully I will be back next week with everything I've managed to make in September.Have a good week all-X-"},
{"title": "Summer's last hurrah ", "date": "Saturday 9 September 2023", "text": "Summer decided to make a comeback this week, just as the children went back to school! July and August were mostly a washout but this past week we have had temperatures of 30°C every. Single. Day.  Phew, It's been hot too hot to walk about really but you know what they say, only mad dogs and English men go out in the midday sun! Ha ha.Mark had a few days holiday this week so we decided to take a little over night trip to Upton on Severn, a pretty little riverside town about an hours drive away.  This was the view from our hotel room.The town itself Is just one street really but there are a few interesting shops as well as the usual charity shops that seem to be in every town nowadays.  There was a lovely fabric and yarn shop and I might have bought some sock yarn home with me -  Only one ball though, I was good 😁There was also the loveliest cafe / book shop that I've ever seen.  We spent a happy half hour in there, but I could have quite easily have curled up on one of the many chairs dotted around with my book and a cuppa.  In my dream house I would have a room like this, with bookshelves full to over flowing and big squishy sofas and leather armchairs.  In reality that's not likely to ever happen but I can dream 😉Henry's Cafe and book shop - Upton on SevernThis was one of the houses along the river, Isn't it beautiful? Oh how I'd love a nosey round inside there! Now I bet this would have a room to accomodate my dream library with the squishy sofas🤣 We had a lovely breakfast on Saturday morning and then set for to explore Tewksbury,  another historic riverside town a short drive away. The town of Tewksbury grew following the building of the Abbey in the twelfth century, the ground being consecrated in 1121.  Tewksbury is also in the History books as being the place where the Battle of The Roses took place in 1471 when The House of York were victorious over the Lancastrians.Each July the battle is re-enacted at the Medieval FestivalTewksbury Abbey, which apparently has the largest Norman tower in EuropeThe town still has some lovely old black and white buildings, this one has a date under the window, 1765.  Hard to believe that these building have survived so long, I wonder if buildings of today will last as long, they certainly wont be as pleasing to look at if they do. If you love to browse around second hand bookshops then this certainly is the place to come! This was one of two book shops that I got lost in for a while.We really enjoyed our couple of days away and didn't have to travel too far to have some time out and some lovely scenery.September in the garden - We still have some bits of colour here and there, although It won't be long until I have to empty the planters, most are past their best now.  A lot of things haven't done as well this year, not as many roses and the hydrangea flowers haven't seemed to have lasted so long, the red one has been particularly disappointing, the leaves have been very small compared to how it looked last year.I don't think I will plant as many pots up next year, the garden falls to me to look after as Mark has no interest in gardening at all, he will help If I ask but he wouldn't go out there on his own accord so I  may as well make it easier on myself.Update on Molly - Since I wrote last time Molly had to visit the vets again, this time she spent two nights there.  I took her back because she hadn't pooped in two days.  Turned out she was a little dehydrated and constipated, the stitch they put in wasn't helping as there wasn't enough room for her to pass what was there.  Poor thing must have been so uncomfortable!They took the stitch out, gave her a relaxant and put her on a drip to rehydrate her, she has also had a vitamin B12 jab to help increase her appetite.  After all that she finally 'went' and they were happy for me to collect her on Tuesday.  Fortunately she hasn't prolapsed again, she will have to continue with lactulose to help her and have another vitamin B12 jab next week then the vet will want to see her again about a week after that.  Her blood test came back all ok so hopefully, (crossing my fingers), this is all a result of constipation, which can be sorted.She's been out in the garden enjoying the lovely weather this week and I hope she will be back to her usual self soon-X-"},
{"title": "My Stick6in2023 finish and our little holiday", "date": "Sunday 3 September 2023", "text": "Another two months of this year gone already and so It's time to share my forth stitched piece for the Stick6in2023 SAL hosted by Martina and Manuela Number one was chosen for the months of July and August, for me this corresponded to The Reindeer by Cottage Garden Samplings.  This chart was one of my purchases from last Autumns Nimble Thimble meet up so I'm super happy that it hasn't been waiting too long for me.I used all the recommended DMC threads, the fabric is 32 count Belfast linen and I managed to find a suitable frame from The Range.Isn't he beautiful?  I'm really happy with how he turned out, I've put him away for now but he won't have to wait too long to be on show.The number 6 has been drawn for our next piece and I can't wait to get started next week!last week I had a week away with Joanne and the children to Butlins at Minehead.  If you are from the UK you will know that Butlins holiday parks are mainly designed for children, (although they do hold themed and adult weekends at different times through the year).  The weather was kind, it only rained one day and we even managed to have a day on the beach, which we all enjoyed so much despite both myself and Joanne saying we didn't like sand we had as much fun as the kids!It's just lovely to see children's happy smiley faces doing simple things like digging in the sand and riding on the fairground rides, Jacob does love to go on the rides and laughs the whole time.Jacob taking in the pantomimeBonnie meets Bonnie Bear :-)Joanne had booked some shows to see, so we had Pepper Pig, a pantomime, which was as good if not better than any I've seen, a magic show with Steven Mulhern and a Animal versus Dinosaurs show which was excellent.I came back feeling more rested than I thought I would considering it was an activity filled week, Bonnie declared it the best week ever, so I think It's safe to say that she had a good time too!~~~~~~~~~That's all the fun stuff, now for an update on Molly.    Unfortunately she did end up going back to the vets last Sunday night, they put in a stitch to hold everything in place but she has only pooped once in the week and I could see she wanted to go yesterday but couldn't, so I booked her in for another visit this morning.  That's where she is now, they wanted to keep her overnight because she was still constipated and was a little dehydrated, they are going to take out the stitch and give her something to help her 'go' and give her some fluids, they will also do a blood test to make sure there is nothing else going on.  Potentially she will have to have another stitch if she prolapses again when she's 'been'.  I've tried to call them to see how she is but they were doing a change over and will call me later.  I have everything crossed that she will be ok.  -X-"},
{"title": "Hello, is there anyone there?", "date": "Friday 25 August 2023", "text": "I disappeared there for a while, It wasn't intentional just busy with other things.  As well as not writing a blog post I've not been reading all of your news either, I'll try and catch-up over the weekend, although not promising as I'm off on a little adventure with Joanne and the kids next week and things need to be sorted and packed for that.  But more about that when I get back.July was a slow month for any crafty makes, I finished a pair of socks, sewed another small bag and fully finished a previously stitched ornament, not bad considering everything else going on, (another bedroom decorated and the loft re-insulated), but I always expect more of myself.First off are the socks......These are the Rose City Rollers socks by Mara Catherine Bryner.I lost the ball band, (again), but I'm pretty sure the yarn is another Mr & Mrs Rabbit yarn.I like the rolled cuff and they are very comfortable, I'll definitely be making more of these in the future.There was plenty of fabric left over when I made Bonnie's little bag and she asked if I would make one for her friend's birthday so they could have the same.  I'm pretty sure there is still enough fabric to make another one, certainly got my money's worth from that particular purchase :-)I also finally got round to fully finishing the little PS peice I stitched back in AprilThere are only a couple of weeks left of the school holidays, those six weeks or so have gone really quickly! I've only had the children a few times while they have been off as mums and dads have taken holidays from work to either go away or just have days out.  Jenny James and the boys made it back home safely after their wild fire escapade in Rhodes.  Their luggage was sent on a couple of weeks later, although they are still missing their hand luggage which contained the boys Amazon tablets, headphones and Olivers Nintendo switch and games, as a ten year old boy you can imagine how he is feeling now not being able to play minecraft with his friends!  Fingers crossed these bags will turn up eventually but as there were thousands of people evacuated or moved around that they may well have to accept that they will not get them back  I had the boys for the day on the Monday after they came back from holiday, as Bonnie was out for the day with her friend, (the one I made the bag for), I offered to have Jacob too and we went to Stourport for the day.  There are loads of things to keep the kids occupied there in the Summer, the small fair is open and they had great fun on the rides, Oliver and Arty on the water dingy was hilarious to watch, Oliver was playing it safe then Arty pulled the wheel to one side and they kept spinning around, he is such a little devil, so funny though.  Managing 3 boys on my own was a challenge but I came through unscathed, albeit shattered.Oliver and Arty won a fish on the fair, Arty wasn't too bothered but Oliver bless him, he was so excited, they haven't got any pets so this made his day.Notoriously fairground fish don't last too long but as I write this they are still going strong :-)There have been another few outings since which I might mention another time because I don't want this post to be too long.This morning I've had to take Molly to the vets, I won't go into detail of the mess I got up to this morning but you can have a guess when I tell you she has a rectal prolapse. The vet did a procedure, (again you can guess what!) and fingers crossed it will stay put, if not she will have to have it stitched.Poor thing, she must be so sore but is on pain killers and lactulose now for a few days so will hopefully be feeling better soon.Right I'll leave it there for now, It will be time to show our finish for Stick6in23 when I post again :-)Take care-X-P.S.  Just in case you are wondering, Molly does have her own lovely bed where she would be much more comfortable, but no, she is choosing to lie, rather awkwardly It has to be said, on the mat!"},

{"title": "A productive June", "date": "Monday 3 July 2023", "text": "June went by so quickly, how can we be halfway through the year already!  It's definitely an age thing, the older you get, the faster time seems to go!   I do try and make the most of my time each day, and this month as well as the things I was working on, I've also tried to get some of those languishing  projects fully finished.Firstly, the things I started and finished in June.My first attempt at lace knitting in a sock.  These are the Rosie Lee socks by Twinset & Purl.I really enjoyed knitting these, they seemed to knit up quite quickly too, probably because the lace section made knitting more interesting.  The yarn is Lace Hankies by Lay Family YarnMy second pair of socks for the month, I know! I was on a roll, lol. My first pair of trainer socks.I didn't follow a pattern for these, I knit 12 rounds of ribbing and 10 rounds before doing the heel and then my normal length for the foot.You will notice that they are not 'twins' they are not even 'sisters', more like 'cousins' 😀I have no idea why the yarn behaved so differently on each sock!I still love them and no one will know what's inside my trainers 😉  The yarn is from Mr & Mrs Rabbit, who no longer dye yarn, which is a shame because they did the most beautiful colourways, unfortunately I misplaced the ball band so don't know this colourway.My next finish is something you haven't seen in progress, It's the Trescao Jumper by Along Aven AnnaI actually finished this in April, but then realised I didn't like the garter stitch hem and cuff, so I pulled those out and re-knit them in 1x1 rib.Obviously too warm to wear at the moment but it will do nicely for Autumn and Winter.My last knitting finish is also something I started a while ago, it's a cardigan for Bonnie and it has been waiting for quite a while for me to sew up the sleeves and put buttons on.  Good job I made a larger size!The yarn is James C. Brett Stonewash.I have one sewing finish for June.  You may remember that when I took Bonnie to the craft show at the NEC in March she chose a pattern for me to make her a bag, along with the fabric, and here it is.This came out way better than I expected, the only fiddly part was the top stitching around the top edge.  It was supposed to be a little present to go in her birthday bag but she saw it when she came round one time and wanted to take it home.   My daughter has asked if I will make another one for Bonnie's friends birthday this month, there is plenty fabric left to make another one, I just have to buy some webbing for the handle, so that will be a little project for July.And last but not least, I had two cross stitch finishes in June.The first one is another Autumn pillow.  Love how this turned out!  I used the called for threads with the exception of the border which should have been black and I switched to a dark grey.Pumpkin Spice Everything by The Scarlett HouseMy second cross stitch finish is my Stick6in2023 piece.  For the months of May and June the number 3 was generated, and for me that happened to be the number I had allocated to another Autumn chart, Pumpkin Hollow by Little House NeedleworksI chose to only stitch the top half of the chart because I wanted it to fit onto this wooden pumpkin blanc I bought from Hobbycraft a couple of years ago.  I dry brushed the blanc with some paint from a match pot and I think It came out cute!That's all my finishes for June, not too bad considering It's been a busy month.The weather has been mostly good and everything in the garden has shot up, it's been keeping me busy watering, dead heading and generally keeping it tidy.  The roses have been lovely, the first blooms have just about gone now but there are some second ones appearing and, I had my first poppy, just one, lol.  I've had this poppy plant for about three years and this is the first flower it's produced, I've left the seed head hoping that I can harvest the seeds to plant moreWe also finished decorating our bedroom this month,  it took a while because Mark only has the weekends to do anything.  Mark panelled one wall and put in wall lights and we had a guy come and spray our wardrobe and bedside tables.  We also had new carpet and blinds and I'm over the moon with the result, It's so light and airy I can't wait to go to bed at night, lol.I've taken the boys out a couple of times for tea and went strawberry picking with Joanne and these two rascals.I think the ate their fill of strawberries while we were picking! I made jam with my haul and for a first attempt it came out pretty good, so I've been told.I've continued my weight loss through June, I'm now 18lb's down, still jotting down everything I eat through the day and keeping track of calories, it's just become something I do now, and It's working.  I haven't eaten any cake, chocolate or sweets since April and I have to say I haven't missed any of those things at all, I eat almost everything else, just count the calories, calorie deficit works, who knew! My plans for July - The number 1 has been generated by Martina for Stick6in2023, this will be our project to work on during the months of July and August, I made a start on my choice on Saturday.I'll pick another stitching project to work on and rotate them each week, that worked for me in the past so I need to get back to doing it that way.More decorating is on the agenda, we are re-doing the smallest bedroomthere's not so much work to do in there, the radiator has to be changed but as far as decorating goes it's just a matter of painting, so should be a quicker process.If July is as busy as June was I probably won't post again until the end of the month but hopefully there will be more finishes to share 😁Have a great month!-X-"},
{"title": "Solo Saturday outing", "date": "Tuesday 20 June 2023", "text": "I haven't had a day out for a while, decorating and keeping on top of the garden have taken up any spare time I've had but I noticed that Much Wenlock had a Made in Shropshire market happening on Saturday, so while Mark was fitting our new bedroom lights and rehanging the door I took myself on a little outing.Much Wenlock is a medieval market town in the Shropshire countryside, about forty minutes from us and is a pleasant drive with countryside views for most of the way.    I've passed it many times on my way to our Nimble Thimble meet-ups but never stopped to walk through.  The main street was closed to traffic because of the market, there were about twenty or so stalls selling various handmade wares.  There are no big name stores here, just a few independent shops, gift shops and cafe's and a beautiful yarn shop called Ippikn.  I might have treated myself to a ball of sock yarn, (It would have been rude not to), but unfortunately couldn't get a photo of the shop front because there were too many people about.  You can find Ippikin on FB though if you are interested.Holly Trinity Church, where there was a wedding happening, lots of people stopped to get a glimpse of the brideThe Guildhall is at the end of the main street, this holds various exhibitions throughout the year, on market day you can buy fruit, veg and flowers from the ButtermarketAfter browsing what was on offer in the markets and having some lunch in one of the cafes I thought I'd have a stroll around the other streets and be nosey at the houses and gardens, as you do.  Oh my goodness there were some super cute cottages and some rather grander houses, all beautiful, I'll let you have a lookThe Police Station, built in 1864 is now a beautiful house and a grade II listed building, I love the blue brick brickwork.I didn't get a photo of the whole of the next building, it was the name over the doorway that caught my eye. Apparently Richard de Bastard owned the original Hall in the 13 century, that house was destroyed by fire and was replaced by the one standing there today.   I suppose the name is quite unique and that's why It's remained, still, not sure I'd like it as my address. There is an old estate agents listing from 2017 HERE, if you want to see what It's like inside.After that I got rather obsessed with front doors and roses, but they are all so pretty so I think you'll forgive me :-)Aren't they gorgeous?   Now of course I want roses growing around my door too 😁😁I think I may try to go back to Much Wenlock for a visit again soon as there is lots more to see, there is an old Priory which I didn't have time for on Saturday and Wenlock Edge for wooded and scenic walks~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Before I sign off I'd like to thank those of you who left me a comment on my last post.  It means a lot that you took the time to write me a few words.  This first week without Millie in the house has been a strange one, It seems quieter somehow, even though Millie wasn't a very vocal cat, (neither is Molly). It was always Millie who greeted me at the door If I'd been out, I've missed that, a lot.  Molly has seemed a bit quieter too, she has lost her best friend and sleeping companion, they used to lie together all the time so she must be feeling her absence too poor thing.  Hopefully she'll perk up again soon.-X-"},
{"title": "Our Millie", "date": "Sunday 11 June 2023", "text": "I'm so very sad to say that we had to say goodbye to Millie on Friday.   She had been getting steadily worse over the last month or so and last Tuesday I noticed she was having trouble with one of her back legs and that It was swollen.  A trip to the vets that night revealed it was fluid, she had it in both back legs but one was very bad.  We were told that there was nothing that could be done for that and it was probably time to think about letting her go. From then she didn't want to leave her bed much, only to eat, which was very little, and to lie in the sunshine on the step occasionally.  The swelling seemed to go down a bit but by Friday morning she was clearly struggling to walk very far at all and we could tell that It was time.You can imagine how I felt, I was in bits. I wanted her to have her last hours in the comfort of her own home, and we were able to arrange that, but waiting for the vet to arrive was just awful.  In the end she was comfortable in her bed and had all her favorite treats, cake, some milk and a cheese triangle.  She didn't even notice the vet was there and I was right there beside her all the time.  Millie chose us 19 years ago, running to us and climbing onto Stevies lap as we knelt down to look at a pile of kittens asleep on the floor, I remember saying to Stevie that we have to have this one because she has chosen us.  We have always been glad that she was the one that came home with us that day.  She had such a quiet gentle soul but could be oh so funny and very playful.  We were blessed to have her with us for so long and will always miss her sweet little face.Sleep tight my beautiful girl-X-"},

{"title": "This week", "date": "Wednesday 10 May 2023", "text": "I finished the socks I cast on when I was away while watching the coronation on Saturday.  The yarn is by Felt Fusion in the colourway Little Dancer on their hight twist zebra base.  In hindsight I wish I had used a contrast for the heel and toes, still, I think they came out fine and no one sees heels and toes when they are in your shoes do they 😉 Last Thursday Oliver and Arty had an inset day, Jenny was at work so dropped them here in the morning and I took them for a day out at Wightwick Manor.  It's somewhere I've been a few times, as  have the boys, the grounds are lovely, there is plenty of open space for the boys to run around and as it was a school day for most children It was fairly quiet.  Luckily the weather was nice enough for us to sit and enjoy our picnic outside where we could watch the baby geese.  Once the  boys had burnt off some energy running round we went to look around inside the house, I didn't take any photos of the interior this time but I've posted a couple times previously about Wightwick Manor, if you want to have a peek, here in 2016 and here in 2021.  In one of the final rooms was a dressing up box, they both had fun trying on different outfits, I managed to get Arty to stand still long enough to get a photo. The weather is a bit hit and miss at the moment, shame it rained all day for the coronation, although it didn't seem to dampen anyones spirit for celebrating in London, Sunday was a much better day, very warm and sunny, good job too as there were many street parties organised, including one in our little  cul de sac.  We had jobs to get done so didn't go, but I did send along a couple of bottles and our apologies for not joining in this time.That's about all the goings on this week, I'll leave you with some photos of the lovely tulips we had this year.  I these bought these online from Farmer Gracy, on the whole they were great but a few didn't open and the head just went mouldy, never had that happen before so not sure what happened.Thanks for popping by, see you soon.-X-"},
{"title": "Stick6in2023 - March and April", "date": "Monday 1 May 2023", "text": "I hope your May Bank Holiday went well, however you chose to spend it.   It's been a busy one for us, nothing very exciting but something that has been in the planning for a while.  This morning we emptied and dismantling the wardrobes ready for the next stage of the bedroom decoration, and this afternoon was spent in the garden.  Everything is growing at a rate now, I really noticed the difference after a week away when I came back on Saturday.  We didn't sit down until after 6pm, hence the lateness of my post but, as it's the 1st of May I wanted to share my finish for the Stick6in2023 hosted by Martina and Manuela.  I am choosing to take part in the easier option of  choosing six charts for the year and allocating each of them a number, 1-6.   The number 2 was chosen for March and April and this was my chart with that number allocated.Oct 31 by Cottage Garden Samplings I stitched it on 36 count linen, 1 over 2.  I used the recommend threads with the exception of the black used in the raven, for that I used DMC 310 in place of overdyed called for.I was drawn to the pumpkin on this chart, although I do think the raven is mighty fine too. And here it is all framed.(Apologies for the poor photo It was getting dark when I took it and this was the best of a bad bunch)I ended up ordering a frame from Amazon after trawling around various shops looking for something suitable.  I know a lot of you mention buying frames at charity shops for finishing, I do look but never seem to get lucky.The number 3 has been pulled for May and June and have everything ready and looking forward to make a start at the weekend.Part two of my day in Conwy The walls around Conwy were built between 1283 and 1287 as part of the defence system alongside Conwy Castle.  It takes around three quarters of an hour to walk and they can be accessed from three gateways at different sections.  Again, amazing views of the small town and in the distance the castle.  Some parts are quite steep and there is only a two bar railing on the one side, so not somewhere you would take children for sure!Interestingly I found out that the castle when built was not the colour it is now, it was white, It would have been so much more visible then against the blue of the sea and the green of the fields behind it.The wall finishes at the harbour, I loved how the little boats were all lined up along the shore, so pretty.As I'd started my walk in the middle I re-traced my steps and then continued the rest of the walk.I thoroughly enjoyed my day out in Conwy, although it's definitely a town for sight seeing, you would be disappointed if you went for the shopping experience.  I promised myself that when I visited Llandudno again I would walk around the Great Orme.  It's five miles along Marine Drive, there are some sections with quite an incline but that was ok, I could stop and have a rest while taking in the wonderful views, I was in no rush.  I didn't take many photos this time but there are plenty to see on a previous post, Driving The Great Orme.Down on a section of beach I was lucky enough to see some seals too.  The beach wasn't really accessible so they were quite safe there. I can highly recommend a solo break, I've definitely come back more relaxed than when I went and wouldn't hesitate in doing it again sometime.-X-"},

The bridge was one of the first suspension bridges in the world and is a grade I listed structure, now taken care of by The National Trust and is passable by foot.  On the right is the tubular railway bridge, it was built between 1846 and 1848 one of the first examples built of this type of bridge, and the only one left, it too is now grade I listed.I'll share my walk along Conwy town walls another time.Enjoy the rest of your week-X-"},

{"title": "Happy Easter", "date": "Monday 10 April 2023", "text": "I finished the socks I cast on in March.  These are knit using yarn that Jo gifted to me at Christmas, (or it might have been for my birthday in December, I forget which now).  The colourway is Peony by Wool Is The Answer and the pattern is Library Socks by The Kitchen Sink Shop, a free pattern on Ravelry.I love how they came out.  The pattern is a simple four row repeat and easy to memorise.  I used a mini from my stash for the contrast heels and toes which turned out to be a great match for the beautiful main colourway.A while ago I treated myself to one of the Spring Gift Boxes from West Green Loft Yarns, It arrived a couple of weeks ago and I saved it to open as my Easter Treat.  Here's what was in the box.I'm away for a week soon so going to save this to cast on then.The kids came round yesterday to hunt for eggs and stayed a couple of hours but we hadn't planned any family get together, which turned out to be a blessing because I'm not feeling too good.  Last Wednesday I had a vertigo attack, not severe, but enough to keep me in bed until late afternoon.  It had passed the next day but on Thursday night my throat started to hurt and on Friday morning my body felt like it had been run over by a truck!  I gradually felt worse over Saturday and developed a dry cough, my voice was no more than a squeak on Sunday and I feel no better this morning, although thankfully I'm not coughing as much.  I haven't felt this bad in years, even when I had Covid eighteen months ago I didn't feel this bad.  I know symptoms of Covid have changed so I have done tests everyday and they are all negative.  If I feel no better tomorrow I'll call the docs but for now I'm drinking copious amounts hot water with honey, lemon and ginger and taking paracetamol for the throat pain.  I'll sign off with some photos from the garden, the weather was really quite lovely a few days last week and everything looks very Spring-like and lush.I hope you all had a lovely Easter and have enjoyed this Bank Holiday weekend.Take care-X-"},
{"title": "Going into April", "date": "Monday 3 April 2023", "text": "I have a few projects that are almost finished, a baby cardigan that needs buttons, a cardigan for Bonnie that needs the button bands picking up and knitting and a pair of socks that are at the point of doing the toe decreases.  All so close yet not fully finished.   Is it just me, or does anyone else get something almost done and then sort of looses momentum?  Last week was a busy one, I was on nanny duty for four days and two visits to the vets with Millie and Molly, they were due jabs and a check-up, all ok with Molly, Millie, not so good, we are waiting for thyroid blood test results, hopefully they will be back sometime this week and I will give you an update next time.  So, not much time for stitching or knitting this past week, just the odd hour here and there.  I'm still working on my stick6in23 piece and loving it, I'm on track to get this one finished perhaps this coming weekend.  And, talking of Stick6in23, I collected my first finish for this SAL from the framers on Saturday.Finished as another box frame. I love how it came out.  I used my local needlework shop again, Betty Stitch Kit in Quarry Bank. **********************The weather was mostly wet all last week so I didn't manage to get out for a decent walk, other than when I was collecting the kids, but I managed to persuade Mark to come walking along another section of the Stourbridge canal with me last Saturday.  Our starting point was a ten minute drive away at Stourton, walking back towards where I'd started out from on my last walk.The weather was quite nice we did have a little bit of rain along the way, but it lasted a few minutes, not enough to put us offIf anyone is up for a challenge this wreck is up for sale, £250, serious offers only, so the notice said🤣🤣Loved these houses backing onto the canal, I would love to sit out there in the SummerAfter an hour we were back at the bridge where the canal splits again, ahead to Amblecote, and to the right Stourbridge and the Bonded Warehouse, (where I started last time).  We had been walking for about an hour to this point so decided to turn and walk back to where we had left the car.  I'm really enjoying discovering these local canal walks, I find it strange that you can't really work out where you are, it feels like you are in the middle of the countryside, yet you know that a town or a main road it not very far away.  As we drove home we tried to work out where we had walked in relation to the road and even though at one point you could see across the fields you would never have known there was such a lovely peaceful walk to be had.Mark doesn't really see the point in walking for the sake of it but he must have enjoyed it because he suggested taking the other route towards Wolverhampton this Saturday, we weren't able to do it though because I had plans to take these two rascals on an easter trail with JoanneWe did find the Easter Bunny at the end, but Jacob refused to have his photo taken with him, lolI've not long got home from my aqua class, I'm really enjoying these classes, at first I wasn't sure I would but they have now become something that I do twice a week, and I feel better for getting out of the house, having some routine and of course the exercise.  As it's another beautiful day today my afternoon job is to clean out the summer house and perhaps even sit in there for a while later.  It gets really warm in there late afternoon so I may take my stitching and have an hour later.If I don't pop back before next weekend I hope you have a lovely Easter!-X-"},
{"title": "A crochet finish", "date": "Monday 27 March 2023", "text": "Last week was a bit of a write-off.  I had some sort of allergic reaction which caused puffiness all around my eyes and my left cheek.  No idea what caused it, I hadn't used anything new or different nor had I eaten anything that I haven't eaten before.  I ended up going to the docs because the pharmacist at the chemist was useless, he kept trying to sell me eye drops and telling me to moisturise!  Doc was very thorough but as mystified as I was as to the cause, she recommended taking piriton for a few days and if things didn't improve, or got worse to go back.  I felt a bit rough anyway but taking the piriton too wiped me out most days.  Happy to say I feel much better now.As you can see I finished my Crofter blanket, It's only been waiting in the wings since 2018!!  It's actually been finished for a couple of weeks but it's only been this past week that I managed to get round to sewing in the ends.Still not sure what I'm doing with it, It may come in handy in the summer for when the kids are playing in the garden so i'll put it away for now and see if it gets any use in the summer.I'll leave it there for today and sign off with some photos of another lovely canal walk I did the previous week,  another section of the Stourbridge canal, (No. 2), starting at the Bonded Warehouse and heading towards Kinver. I didn't do the whole walk, although I would like to soon as it was very picturesque.Enjoy your week and I'll see you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Come walk with me and finishing a couple of ornaments", "date": "Tuesday 14 March 2023", "text": "I have to be in the mood to take on the ornament fully finishing process, no matter how many times I do it I still don't find it easy, so best not leave it until I have more than a couple to do.If you recall I wrongly thought I was stitching on 32 count for my January ornament, the one on the left, and It was larger than I wanted so for February's ornament I found some polka dot linen in my stash that I knew for certain was 32 count.  I am much happier with this one.  I shamelessly copied the lovely Carol, of Stitching Dreams and omitted the section he was standing on  so that it would fit into the oval shape.  If I stitch any more from that booklet I will definitely be doing the same again, they look so much better and the process is easier.Both are from book No.80 of The Prairie Schooler Old World Santas.(That red bow looks quite bright in the photo, it's really not the bright, must be the light today)I can't call myself British if I don't mention the weather and seeing as It was the main topic in the news I have to show you what greeted me when I opened the curtains last Thursday morning, yes we had some more snow.  What a pretty sight, unfortunately it didn't last, by mid afternoon it was all gone, I've never seen snow disappear so fast, lol.Since then we have has a mixed bag of rain, sun and wind.  It was dry on Saturday morning though so I went for another jaunt along the canal, this time taking the opposite direction to the one I shared in my last post.  This one is the Dudley No 1 canal which is on the opposite side of the road to the Stourbridge canal walk I did last week.  I did a bit of reading after last weeks walk, as you do, and thought I'd share a bit of history of this particular section of the canalThere was an original plan in 1775 for a single canal but that bill was opposed and so the the project was split in two and resubmitted to Parliament and were authorised separately.  They were opened in 1779 and following a joint restoration project between Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Society and the British Waterways Board, were reopened in 1967My walk started at the end of the Dudley No. 1 Canal and is the boundary to the Stourbridge Canal. There are eight locks on this section, (there were originally nine) but locally are still called the nine locks.I was very happy to see this fella sitting on the wall at the start of the locksAt the top of the locks looking backStill walking along the canal, there is a good view here of part of our huge local shopping centre.  Built on what was farmland The Merry Hill Centre has around 200 shops, a retail park, food court and cinema as well as the usual fast food places and 10,000 parking spaces!  I avoid going unless absolutely necessary but unfortunately all the bigger stores moved here from surrounding towns so sometimes you have no choice.  The building work started here in 1985 and 1990, despite local protesting over building work being carried out on green space instead of the adjacent former Round Oak Steel Works site.   Since then there have been several extensions and alterations.  In the beginning we thought it was great, there was even a monorail! (which went bust many years ago and was dismantled), but it has been the downfall of all the surrounding towns as no shops want to go to the small towns anymore, if you want anything you have no choice but to brave it.At little further along is the Marina or the Waterfront as it's now called.  There are some pubs and restaurants along here, there used to be a couple of night clubs too, not sure if they are still there today.  There is a lot of office space. The West Midlands Ambulance headquarters and control room are here, also HMRC (the Tax Office) and Black Country Radio, as to what else is there and what they do in all those offices I have no idea.This area used to be The Round Oak Steel Works and was founded in 1857 by Lord Ward.  During the Industrial Revolution the majority of iron-making in the world was carried out within 20 miles of The Round Oak and It was the first in the UK to be converted to natural gas supplied for the North Sea.  The History of The Round Oak steel works is a story all of it's own, I don't know a lot about it but I remember when it closed in 1982 and the affect it had on the area, so many people lost jobs, it was a sad time.The steel works made use of the canal that ran though it, I'm sure it looks a lot prettier now than it did back then.Not such a picturesque walk now we're are past the marina.  The land behind the fence is also where the steel works used to be and is undeveloped but has been left like a wasteland.I only went a little further over that bridge, there wasn't another person in sight and I started to feel a little bit vulnerable, also it had started to drizzle, so I decided to turn back.  I remembered to bring some bread for the wildlife this time, not so much on this section but this little fella made me laugh.He deserved a treat after that :-)I hope you enjoyed walking with me and weren't too bored with the little potted history.  Where we live is full of interesting things if we take the time to investigate, don't you think?-X-"},
{"title": "So far this week", "date": "Wednesday 8 March 2023", "text": "I finally finished the socks I cast on at Christmas.  I've lost the ball band but I'm fairly sure the yarn is a sock set from West Green Loft Yarns.   I've noticed that the previous socks I've knitted have started to feel a little loose so I went down to 68 stitches for these and the fit seem much better.  I don't think I could get away with 64 stitches, they might be a little tight to get on but I will wear these for a while and see how they feel and perhaps try a 64 stitch sock at some point for comparison.I spent most of Saturday in the garden, the weather forecast said that this week was going to turn colder and I wanted to do one last tidy up of the leaves before the garden waste collection today.   There are lots of things coming up, the daffs are almost there and the tulips shouldn't be too far behind.  At least now the last of the leaves are cleared we will be able to see them betterYesterday was forecast to be the best day of the week so I decided to go for a walk, it's been ages since I got out for a decent walk, I chose a canal walk that is near to where my eldest daughter lives and about ten minutes drive from me.I didn't think there would be so much wildlife on the water and I regretted not taking something for them.It was quite chilly despite that lovely blue sky and those fluffy clouds, a perfect day for a walk.I walked further than I intended as I took a wrong turn and ended up on a different section of the canal and had to re-trace my steps to get back to where I should have been.  Oh well, It boosted my step count for the day!Today the weather couldn't be more different, we have some snow.  Now don't laugh, this is as much snow as we've had this year, I doubt it will get any worse, it's already turned to sleet.Today I've done my usual Wednesday morning aqua fit class and a pile of ironing so I think I've earned a couple of house sitting with my stitching, It's too horrible out there to do anything else.Tomorrow I have a hair appointment and Friday Is sewing day and then It will be the weekend again, these weeks keep rolling by don't they.Enjoy the rest of your week-X-"},

{"title": "First finish of 2023", "date": "Monday 23 January 2023", "text": "I want to try and use up some odd balls of acrylic yarn that I have, In most cases I have just one or two balls of a colour, not enough to make a garment, even a small one so I will make a few small blankets to use them up.  This one is a small pram/pushchair size, I had one ball of the blue so worked until that had gone.  It's for no one in particular, I might donate it or ask one of the girls if they know anyone who could use it.I have more grey and white so I will see what else I can team that with to make another one soon.I've enjoyed working on this simple granny square and remembered that I have another crochet blanket that I started a few years ago and didn't finish. This is the Crofter Blanket and it's been a good few years since it's seen the light of day, but now it's out I'm going to try and do a bit each week until it's finished.All the squares are made, some are even joined into rows so it's just a matter of joining the rest of the squares then joining them all together.I think I put it away because I wasn't too keen on the colour, and it's still not my favourite colourway but It's better finished than sitting in a box, and if i don't like it once it's finished I can always give it away.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~One of my doctors appointments last week got cancelled, twice, my smear test is now Feb 7th, unless it gets cancelled again.  Physio wants me to go to do rehabilitation, that will entail a weekly session at one of the local hospitals,  but first she wanted to do some blood tests and will make me an appointment a once those have come back.  I've had achilles tendinitis for years on and off, it was particularly bad all summer last year, I've been doing the recommended exercises for over twelve months and it's never gone away completely, I just have days when it's not as bad as others.  The rehabilitation work will, so I'm told, work on strengthening the leg muscles so that there is less strain on the tendon.   I'd just like to walk a decent distance without limping and being in pain, sometimes for days afterwards.Saturday was such a horrible day, it barely got light all day, the weather grey and foggy, not a day for going out but I wanted to do something, so we opted for an afternoon trip to the cinema.   We went to see A Man Called Otto, based on the book A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman.  I had read the book in 2018 and loved it, we have also watched the Swedish film.  This new version, which is set in America rather than Sweden and has Tom Hanks as the cantankerous Otto is good, we both really enjoyed it, It is somewhat different to the Swedish film, but I think that's probably to make it appeal to a wider audience, but well worth it.  If you haven't read A Man Called Ove I can highly recommend it, I'd put it in my top 10 books.Have a lovely week-X-"},
{"title": "Monday Stitching update", "date": "Monday 16 January 2023", "text": "For my birthday in December 2020 my eldest daughter bought me The Meadow by Bothy Threads.  I didn't do much stitching last year but, since Christmas I seem to have got my enthusiasm back for it and made a start on Boxing DayAfter that I didn't pick it up again until last week when I worked a little every day.  I found it slow going at first because I don't usually stitch things that require lots of colour changes, the bunny section has different shades of browns and I found myself getting confused over which symbol matched which brown once they were stitched.  I think I'm getting the hang of it now but it takes a bit more concentration than my normal stitching.  The flowers are much easier and I'm sure will be quicker to stitch.This one will be put to one side this week while I work on my Stick6in2023 SAL.  We have January and February to work on the first number chosen, (N0. 4), mine will probably take most of those two months as I'm alternating weekly with The Meadow, plus, I have chosen a medium sized chart to stitch.That's all for now, I have a busy week this week, picking the boys up two days and I've two doctors appointments, (one is for a smear test, ugh, but it's got to be done hasn't it), one is for a medication check-up and I also have a physio appointment about my ankle.Hope you all have a good week-X-"},
{"title": "Granola - how I make it", "date": "Wednesday 11 January 2023", "text": "When I posted about the granola I made at Christmas some people expressed an interest to know how I made it so I thought I would share that today as I made up a batch today.There are no precise weights and measures for how I make mine, the more ingredients you use the bigger the batch.  This was a smaller batch because It was just for me.As well as the items below, oats, coconut oil, cinnamon and maple syrup, you will also need a selection of nuts and seeds and either raisins sultans or dried cranberries, or a mixture of all three, if that's what you like. I always use these organic oats from Aldi, they are nice and big and not powdery like some others can be.For this batch I had a mixture of nuts left over from when I'd made it at Christmas,  walnuts, pecans and hazelnuts, and I also added some almonds and pumpkin seeds and a handful of mixed seeds too.  You can use whatever nuts and seeds that you prefer.I line the baking tray with foil, (because it's easier to transfer to a container once cooled), and arrange the oats nuts and seeds as shown.* I then add 2-3 tablespoons of coconut oil, (adjust the amount of coconut oil you use to how large a batch you are making, I would suggest you put less rather than more at this stage because you can always add a bit more)Sprinkle with a generous amount of cinnamon and drizzle maple syrup all over.  You can add a pinch of salt if you wish to, (sometimes I do, sometimes I forget, I don't think there is any difference) I set my oven at 180°C and leave it in there until the coconut oil has melted, then I take it out and mix everything together.  At this point you will be able to see if you need to add more coconut oil, you don't want the ingredients too dry, but neither do you want them swimming oil.  I turned my oven down to 165°C and put it back in to cook for about 20-25 minutes.  Of course your's may take longer or cook quicker, depending on your oven.You will easily see when it is ready as it will looks lightly toasted and sound crunchy when you stir it.Once it's cooled for a while add your sultanas/raisins/cranberries, (or all three) and mix those in.    leave it to completely cool before jarring it up.  That's it, it's so easy to make up a batch while your'e cooking something.If you wanted to make the gingerbread granola which I did at Christmas just add the following.  zest of 1 orange plus 1 tablespoon of the juice.   2 tablespoons of black treacle 2 balls stem ginger1 tablespoon of ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon of ground clovesI added all the above to my Christmas batch except for the stem ginger and cloves as that doesn't appeal to everyone.  It turned out great and everyone was happy to receive a jar again this year.I can guarantee that once you try home made granola you will never want shop bought again!Let me know if you try it*I like to arrange the ingredients like this, because I'm slightly ocd and like to see everything in little piles, you can totally just chuck everything on that tray if that's the way you prefer to work, 🤣I'll also copy this page to the recipies tab at the top of the page for future reference  -X-"},
{"title": "Book topic", "date": "Sunday 8 January 2023", "text": "I joined a book lovers group on fb a few months ago, mainly to get book recommendations but also to connect with people who also share a love of reading and books in general.  However, I've had a change of heart about the group.  Since the New Year some people have been posting their Goodreads 2022 reading challenge results on there, along with what they have set their reading challenge to be for 2023.  I was shocked at all the nasty comments from people, most saying that reading was not a competition and that people were showing off saying how many books they had read and they couldn't understand why anyone would want to keep a record/track of what they read, I even read one comment that said they thought it was inappropriate to put what you're reading challenge was for the coming year as it might offend those that did not read that many books....What!  Some of the things being said were just ridiculous.  I set a challenge for myself every year, It's a personal challenge, It never crossed my mind that someone would think it was showing off.  I also like to keep lists so keeping a list of books I've read is just another list to me.  I just couldn't understand the objections.Audio books was another topic that got a lot of negative comments, with many people saying that if you listened to audio books it didn't count as reading, neither should it be counted in the number of books you've read! I'm just giving you the gist of what was said, some comments where quite nasty and I gave up reading any comments on posts that were about reading challenges, I've since left the group, I can do without those sort of negative feelings.   I think there is a  lot of snobbery associated with books, but does it really matter what anyone else reads?  We are all different and like different things, not everyone will enjoy the same books and people will take different things from the same book, and that's ok.All that made me wonder if I should do an end of year book post, but then I thought, why shouldn't I?  I like seeing what other people have been reading, there may be something hasn't been on my radar, plus this blog is about my life and hobbies, reading and books are a big part of my life, so, here are my end of year reading stats.My views on audio books are the complete opposite to that person on the fb group. Studies have been carried out and the findings were that there is no significant difference in comprehension between reading and listening.  I can visualize the scene whether I'm reading a physical book or listening to an audio book, for me there is no difference, infact, in some cases an audio book may be better than the physical equivalent as a good narrator will bring interest, enthusiasm and atmosphere to the story.It took me a long time to get into audio books but for the last couple of years I almost always have one on the go alongside a physical book.  I listen while I'm walking, doing chores or while I'm crafting, I spend a lot of time on my own so they fill the silence at times.   Granted some are better than others, the narration has to be good otherwise it will spoil a good book.My total for audio books in 2022 was 24The best by far was Lesson in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus.  Wonderful writing, sad and funny and great narrationThe best series was the Middle Fall Time Travel series by Shaun Inmon.  There are 17 books in this series and I've finished 8 so far.  They are good escapism.I think The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was the most overrated, I was expecting good things and it didn't deliverI've been making more use of my local library recently too and read 13 library books in 2022.The best of these are the Detective Washington Poe series by M.W Craven, extremely well researched and written.  (If you read any of his books make sure to read the about the book section at the end)I read 6 books from my shelves.Really enjoyed The Woman in the Window and The Child, The Animals at Lockwood Manor was really boring and the most overrated, in my opinion was Where The Crawdads Sing. This last selection were my Reading Group books, there were others but they were ones I'd already read so chose not to re-read them.  As a group we are all agreed that the book choice this year haven't been great,The most disliked book was Normal People, I was the only one that liked it but I do think its a book that would probably mean more if it were read more than once.  I really didn't like The Gustav Sonata although lots of others liked it and strangely the book that none of us enjoyed at all, All Among The Barley was the one that sparked the most discussion.  My Goodreads challenge for the year was 50 books, I'm happy that I reached that goal.  According to goodreads that equates to 17,865 pagesMy longest book was True Colours by Kristen Hannah with 544 pagesMy shortest book was A Bachelor Establishment with 206 pagesOf the books I read, the most shelved on Goodreads was Where the Crawdads Sing,  which was shelved 3,942,045 timesThe least shelved book, of my books, was A Christmas Carol, 11 times.The highest rated (star rating) on Goodreads was A Christmas CarolThe average rating I gave to books in 2022 was 3.3 stars ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Lessons in Chemistry I think was the best book for me last year,  I will continue to read the Washington Poe series as he releases them, they are so well written, and I will carry on with the Middle Falls Time Travel books, they are easy listening and entertaining.I can't remember a time when I haven't read, from when I was very small I can remember having a book with me, but it's not only reading I love, I love books, the smell, the feel even just flicking through pages, there is just something about them that brings me joy.  As a child I would spend hours in our local library and as an adult there is nothing better than finding a new book shop to explore.So what about you?  what books do you enjoy?  Do you think it's cheating to count audio books in the number of books read? Do you also like to keep count?-X-"},

{"title": "December 23rd A magical walk", "date": "Friday 23 December 2022", "text": "It was Jacob's 3rd birthday on Wednesday, Joanne had booked tickets months ago to the Enchanted Garden walk at Webbs garden centre.  At the time I said I would go with them I wasn't expecting much of a show, sometimes these light shows are a bit of a disappointment.  Not so this one, it was truly magical, I think I enjoyed it as much as Bonnie and Jacob.The theme was fairy tales with wonderful scenes created along the walk, here are just a few of themThe walk through the enchanted forest was amazing, they had managed to create a great atmosphere with the sounds of birds and animals and the trees all looked frosted, I took the photo of the trees looking up and you can see the effect the light has on them, so beautiful.There were beautiful light displays all the way along.Santa was there at the end, waving and talking to the children, when he found out it was Jacobs birthday he got the crowd to sing Happy Birthday to him which was lovely.Today I have been trying to get the last few things wrapped and the stockings filled, I'm happy to say that everything is now prepared, the spare bedroom resembles Santa' grotto at the moment, with four grandchildren you can just imagine it can't you, lolI found some time while I was cooking tea to make the some gingerbread granola, I made it for my daughters last year, and It went down really and they, (and my one son in law) have been dropping hints about getting it this year.  I've made loads so hopefully I may get to taste it this time.The recipe was in this Sainsburys magazine from 2021, although if you know how to make granola the only other thing to add is the rind and two tablespoons of the juice of one orange and two tablespoons of black treacle.  Homemade granola is so much better than shop bought and it's just so easy, I first tried making it while we were in lockdown and it's not very often I don't have a jar of it in the cupboard.I've got one more thing I want to make but that depends if Mark can find some soft brown sugar tomorrow, I went to two shops today and neither had it.  Fingers crossed because I would really like to make this, it's a favourite of mine and the girls.-X-"},

{"title": "December 12th - How I knit my mitered square blanket", "date": "Monday 12 December 2022", "text": "I promised last time to time to tell you more about my mitered squared blanket.  Whenever I have shown it on here I get questions about where the pattern can be found, so today I thought I'd share how I'm knitting mine.There many different variations on the mitered square blanket, most patterns  are really just a basic recipe so that you can get the idea of how they are constructed.   The one I found on Ravelry is by Martine Ellis, but like I said there are many others out there - mine Is a mash-up of several I came across.These blankets are often referred to as memory blankets too.  They are great for stash-busting and by using up those scraps of yarn left over from your knitting projects you would eventually end up with something practical and beautiful with lovely memories attached.   I'm knitting mine using 4ply yarn and since I haven't knit that many things in 4ply yarn and only this year got into knitting socks, I didn't have and scraps to use up.  That's when I started buying mini skeins to use.  Over the last three years I have amassed quite a collection of minis, some through swaps, some through yarn advent calendars and some I've just purchased especially for my blanket.I hadn't knitted on my blanket at all this year until this month and I've loved doing a bit each day.  Each square takes just less than an hour to knit and a small amount of yarn, 5g is sufficient, less actually as I find for the size I'm knitting there is still a little left over from 5g.  So this is how I construct my square, I hope it will be of use to those who have asked about it in the past.The pattern is just 2 rows, one row knit one decrease row.(Each of my squares are 48 stitches and I'm using 2.5mm needles) (for the decrease row, right side facing)slip the 1st stitch purl-wise Knit to 2 stitches before the center maker then knit those 2 stitches togetherSlip the marker, knit the next 2 stitches through the back loopKnit to end- knitting the last stitch through the back loop.Slipping the 1st stitch and knitting the last stitch through the back loop on both the knit row and the decrease row creates a nice neat edge which makes picking up stitches for the next square much easier.For the direction of the decrease I'm using one of the templates by Ellie of Crafthouse Magic which you can find on her Cosy Memories tutorials (part 3), on youtube. I feel no particular rush to finish my blanket, it's been in the making for at least two years and although It's been very neglected this year I still love it and enjoy knitting on it as much as when I first started it, half the fun is choosing the next yarn colour.-X-"},

{"title": "Catching up, again", "date": "Tuesday 15 November 2022", "text": "I always seem to be catching up with blog posts at the moment, I say that I don't go anywhere or do much, but lately there have been a few outings and things going so I thought I would try and catch up with some of them today.Saturday was our Autumn meet up at the Nimble Thimble.  I do enjoy these get togetherness, It's a chance to catch up with lovely people and stitch all day with none of the distractions you get at home.  When we met up in April I didn't buy anything, I just didn't feel the need, however, this time I did succumb to temptation.Putini Putini and Cottage Garden Samplings have some lovely charts and I love stitching Christmas and Autumn designsI'd never heard of The Bee Company but just had to have these two cuties.  They both come with the little houses shapes, buttons and fabrics for finishing too.  A couple of weekends ago I went to the Creative Crafts show at the NEC in Birmingham.  I had intended going by train as it's way cheaper than the £16.50 parking charge, but there was a train strike that weekend so I ended up driving anyway.  I did save some money on the parking charge by pre-paying, still, £12.50 is still a fair amount for parking when you have to add the price of the show ticket on top.   Luckily I got a discounted show ticket which only cost £9.50.My intention was to look for fabric for my new make at sewing class and also some sewing supplies.  I didn't get fabric as I thought they were on the expensive side and as I'm still learning I want to keep the cost down.  I did buy a few things though.Pattern for place mats and table center, the fat quarters were purchased to make the table mat, I won't be making place mats.A couple more patterns, both reduced, and a fat quarter of plastic coated fabric.I also bought some tartan fabric and a fat quarter of fur fabric with something Christmasy in mind, and while it was still fresh in my mind I got on and made these last week.I couldn't find a stocking pattern online so drew one myself, that was the hardest part of this project, I think I could have made the foot section a bit more boot shaped, but that's me being picky,  I am happy with them.There was a bit of fur left over so I blinged up a plain red sleigh I'd bought from Home Bargains.I just love how it looks now 🎅Sunday was the Remembrance Day parade, many years ago when I was a Brownie this was a huge event, roads were closed and the parade went through the streets ending at the local church where there would be a service.  Nowadays our local parade and the service are held in the towns park, I suppose it's more to do with money saving than anything else, road closures and policing cost money.  There was still a good turn out nonetheless, although I didn't see any Brownies or Guides, no idea why.  I took Oliver as Jenny was working and James' car was in the garage, thankfully the weather was dry and the temperatures are still very mild here.-X-"},
{"title": "Friday", "date": "Friday 4 November 2022", "text": "Week two of the Christmas Wishes CAL, the snowflake section was released last Thursday and  I've just managed to complete it today.  The snowflakes are worked using tapestry crochet which I've never done before, the stitches are only double crochet but as it's done by following a chart It did take a while to get my head around changing the colours at the right point.   There are probably some mistakes in there but on the whole I'm happy with how it's looking.There was loads of chatter on the fb group of people struggling and the fact that you can see the white carried yarn through the red, I must admit that I initially thought It looks a bit weird too and the snowflakes definitely looked wrong, but the more you did the better it looked.  Actually, now I don't mind the white showing through, it gives a fair isle look to it.Week three was released yesterday but I'm going to have a break from it over the weekend.I hinted at a new hobby a couple of weeks ago, can you guess what it is?Sew With Holly is a lovely little haberdashery shop in our local town.  I popped in for some needles some time ago and found out that they run sewing classes.  I put my name down for when a space became available and got a phone call a few weeks later to say that there was a place starting in September.  I was very nervous because I've not really done any sewing since school, and I wasn't very good then, lol.  But I needn't have worried, Holly, the owner, takes our class and she is lovely.  There are usually only six of us on a Friday morning, (she runs classes on other days too), and everyone is either a beginner or improver.  Holly lets everyone carry on at their own pace but is on hand to help with anything you might need help with.  I needed a lot of help, of course, especially with deciding on size and cutting out.I decided to make the Stevie tunic again, you may remember I made this pattern a few years ago but didn't really know what I was doing.  With Holly's assistance I've been able to make something wearable and modify the pattern to what I wanted.  I added in seam pockets and darts to the front and back so it is slightly more fitted, and I made it longer.  The class is only paid for four weeks in advance and at £9 per class I think It's really good value.  I've just paid for another month and bought my next pattern to start next week, so watch this space, lolI had a winning streak in September.  The lovely and very talented Martina had a Autumn chart giveaway, and I won Welcome Autumn by Primrose Cottage Stitches.Thank you Martina, I shall look forward to stitching this as soon as I can.I also won a yarn giveaway the same week on the podcast Little Likac.  Unfortunately It hasn't arrived, I know she mentioned that she had posted the two giveaways she had but it was around the time of the postal strikes, it's been well over a month now so I imagine that's got lost in the system somewhere.  It's so annoying when things get lost like that, postage isn't cheap, I have let her know today so that she can claim her postage back, if she's able to.I've got tickets to the Creative Crafts show at the NEC in Birmingham tomorrow, I was going to go by train as the parking is very expensive but guess what?  There is a train strike!  So looks like I'm driving.  I have a list of bits and pieces I need want and I shall be on the look out for some fabric for my next sewing project.Hope you all have a lovely weekend-X-"},

{"title": "Hello Suzannah, long time no see ", "date": "Monday 10 October 2022", "text": "Before I forget...I seemed to have caused some confusion last time when I mentioned a jacket potato.  It never occured to me that some of you wouldn't have a clue as to what I was talking about, sorry.   A couple of people asked if it was the same as a baked potato, and indeed it is!  I think years ago we also used to refer to them as a baked potato too, but generally now they are called Jackets Potatoes.----------------There hasn't been an awful lot of stitching going on this year, I just didn't have the inclination to work on anything, but, as part of my effort to be a bit more sociable I decided at the end of August that I would start to go to the stitching group again.  This is the same stitching group I set up many years ago, I'm happy to say it's still going strong, with some of the same people still going who came to that very first meeting.  It was lovely to see and be amongst like minded people again and it was what I needed to get me stitching again.I chose to get Suzannah out of hibernation to take with me.  You may or may not remember seeing her here before, It's been a long time.  I started her on 28th April 2019 when I went to a Nimble Thimble meet-up and then worked on her quite a lot when we went away for a week in early May that year.  The last time I shared any progress, and also the last time I worked on her was 3 years ago, October 2019.  This is how poor neglected Suzannah looked when she came out of hibernation.And this is her nowMust not forget to stitch her eyes!I'm really happy with the progress I'm making, I don't stitch every day but do try to give her a couple of days attention each week.*******************A few weekends ago, when Mark was home, we went to the Autumn Show at the Three Counties Show Ground in Malvern.  We were both very pleasantly surprised at how good it was, there was so much to see and do, there were stalls and marquees selling everything from plants and gifts to garden ornaments and clothes.  There was a dog show, vintage caravans, (loved those!), vintage trucks and cars and for the kids, a vintage fairground and pets corner which had giant turtles, for a small fee you could go in and get among them.There was a 'Best In Show' for flowers and plants and, my favourite, the giant vegetables.  There were cauliflowers as big as your head, leeks and rhubarb as long as your leg and pumpkins big enough to be made into Cinderella's carriage!  It was all wonderful, the weather was brilliant and we had a fantastic day.I hope you can get a sense of how big these are, it's difficult to capture on photos.  I'd like to know how on earth they are able to grow something this big! and how did they then transport it here 🤔 No surprise that this one won, it was huge! I'm on Nanny duty picking the boys up from school this afternoon so I'm off now to have something to eat and a cuppa before it's time to go.  I hope you are all well and having a lovely Monday.-X-"},
{"title": "Previous to October", "date": "Tuesday 4 October 2022", "text": "And just like that, we are in October, I have no idea what happened to September, It seemed to be here and gone in the blink of an eye.  There has been so much going on that I have not blogged about and to catch up in one post would be too much, I'll have to try and catch up over a few posts.I did eventually finish my Whitmore sweater.  You may remember me saying at the beginning of July that I only had the sleeves to knit, well they were done during July and it was washed and blocked while we had all that lovely warm weather.The light was fading when I took these photos so the colour looks a little washed out, it's a much nicer colour in real life.I'm really happy with it and would love to knit another one sometime.  We're not quite into jumper wearing weather at the moment, but I'm sure I'll get the wear it pretty soon.I also finished two more pairs of socks.These are knit in West Yorkshire Spinners, the colourway is Goldfinch with a contrast heels, toes and cuffs (also WYS).  I didn't bother trying to match the pair, I think the saying for this among seasoned sock knitters is that they are sisters, not twins 😉Incidentally, this was the first commercial sock yarn I ever purchased, quite a few years ago now, I saw Julie, (from Julie's stitchyknitter journal) knitting it at a meet up we both attended.  I loved the colourway and bought it soon afterwards, even though I had no idea then how to knit socks!The next pair were for my daughter, Stevie.  She chose this Regia yarn when we went shopping one Saturday, it's the colourway Strawberry from their Tutti Frutti range.  I didn't realise when we bought it but the yarn is 72% cotton, 18% polyamide and 10% polyester.  It was beautiful to knit with, although when I washed them the colour did run a little in the water.I knit one sock then there was a period of time before I started the second one, the eagle eyed among you will notice my mistake right away.I knit 2 x 2 rib on the first sock and 1 x1 on the second one!  I didn't even notice until I had washed them.  I pointed it out to Stevie when I gave them to her and she said, mum, I wouldn't have even noticed if you hadn't told me!Following on from my last post saying that I feel like a recluse, I've been making an effort to get out more.  Weather wise, the last three weekends have been lovely and so on one of the Saturdays when Mark was at work I decided, rather than have a whole weekend rattling around the house by myself I would to take myself off for the day.  I'd been looking at places online and decided on Frome.  It meant a journey of just over 2 hours, but the weather was nice, the roads weren't too busy and It was quite a pleasant and straight forward drive.Frome town itself is not that big, It's described as a bustling, creative market town, but even though there was a small market on the day I went, It wasn't really bustling.  Apparently there is a larger independant market which happens on the first Sunday in the month, perhaps the atmosphere is different then.  It does have a couple of quirky streets, namely, St Catherine's Hill and Cheep Street.  Both of these have various independent shops selling a variety of things and are quite picturesque to walk through, you have to mind your step in Cheep Street to avoid stepping into the little waterway that runs down the middle.Millie Moon is on Catherine Hill and I spent some time in there looking at the lovely fabric, patterns and notions.  I made a small purchase whilst there, which I will tell you the reason for in future blog post.The lady serving in the shop that day was so lovely and helpful, I'd highly recommend a visit if you're in the area.After a couple of hours looking round I'd seen all I wanted to so headed back to my car.  I'd passed through Bradford-on-Avon on the way, about six or seven miles from Frome so thought I'd stop off there on the way home.Not somewhere to go if you want to shop but a really lovely place to take in the scenery.  I walked up to the canal where there is a coffee shop, you can sit outside and watch all the coming and goings of the boats, there were lots of people making the most of the beautiful weather, and I suspect there is also a very pleasant canal walk, although I didn't venture on that as I was alone.There is also a lovely walk along the River Avon, again I didn't venture too far along, but there were at least a couple of pubs with views of the river.As I said the town it'self was not somewhere you would head to if you wanted to shop but there were a couple of nice vintage shops I had a browse round and there were a few coffee shops to choose from.  I'd been fancying a jacket potato so I stopped at one around lunch time.  Amongst other things their menu had jacket potato with two fillings, great.  Until I saw the price.  £11. Now I know prices have gone up, but £11 for a jacket potato! No way.  I got up and walked out.  Admittedly I waited until the waitress had gone in the back before I made my hasty exit, thereby saving us both the embarrassment of  me being honest and saying it was over-priced.You will be happy to know though that I didn't go hungry that day, I found another, more reasonably priced coffee shop around the next corner and enjoyed a lovely goats cheese and caramelized onion quiche and salad :-)-x-"},

{"title": "Making hexies while the sun shines", "date": "Friday 12 August 2022", "text": "Back at the beginning of July I started a birthday project thinking I had given myself plenty of time to get everything completed for today, August 12th.   In hindsight, (isn't hindsight a great thing), I should have started it earlier but, I sure many of you can relate to last minute gift making, as crafters we tend to do that to ourselves don't we?The first task was to paint this little Ikea dolls cot and make a mattress for it, I got both of those jobs completed before the end of July and I was feeling very pleased with myself for being ahead of the game.The mattress is reversible and I was pretty happy with how it came outI fell down the Pinterest rabbit hole of dolls cot bedding and that's when I made more work for myself, I decided that a little patchwork quilt would look lovely.By the time I'd sorted and cut out fabric, ordered the hexie papers and attached the fabric to the papers It left me with just over a week to hand sew everything together.  I've never attempted anything like this before and haven't hand sewn anything in years, but I really enjoyed the process of sewing all the little pieces together.  Now, If you're a quilter reading this, please don't look too closely, technically I've probably gone about it all wrong and it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination,  but I think the end result is passable,The binding was, well, a bind, again, first time binding anything, I managed, again, it's not perfect but then neither is my eyesight, lol.Below is probably more true of the coloursYou can't have a quilt without a pillow and a sheet, so I made those too, I also made a pillowcase for the pillow so it can be taken off to wash.I think the end result is pretty cute, and best of all the recipient loves it.I bet you've guessed who this is for haven't you? Yes, it's for my beautiful granddaughter Bonnie, she turned 5 today.Here she is dressed for her birthday party, look at the gorgeous smile  💖She had a rainbow themed party with all her school friends last Sunday, Joanne had booked an entertainer who was just brilliant and they all had a wonderful time.  Joanne also did a great job making the rainbow birthday cake.As you can imagine not much in the way of other crafting has been going on I been pretty much sewing every single day, sometimes all day, for the last two weeks to get all that bedding done but tomorrow I shall pick my knitting up again, I have just one cuff to knit on my jumper!  The heat wave is set to continue over the next two day and then rain and hopefully cooler temperatures for next week, thank goodness.   Like a lot of others peoples gardens ours is not fairing too well, everything is dry and faded and the grass is turning brown, it's not a good look, I much prefer the Spring and Autumn when everything looks fresh, lush and green.  The only thing this weather is good for is getting the washing dried super quick, although I do have an ironing mountain growing in the laundry room,  you could not pay me enough money to tackle that at the moment!-X-"},
{"title": "Lovely Llandudno and Beautiful Bodnant", "date": "Monday 25 July 2022", "text": "No makes to share this week, I've been trying to get the sleeves of my jumper done and also the last in the trio of socks cast on in June, both seem slow going at the moment but, the end is in sight.  Heritage Hall, (I'm sorry I don't know your name), commented on my last post and asked about the pattern for the corner to corner baby blanket, It's a free pattern by Lion Brand and can be found Here, I have always been asked about where to find the pattern and should have mentioned it last week. So, this weeks happenings.  We went on a little weekend break, from Friday to Sunday this weekend to one of my favourite places, Llandudno, in North Wales.  Bodnant Gardens has been on my list of places to visit for a while and as it's only about 6 miles from Llandudno we thought we would combine the two visits.After all the fine hot weather of last week the forecast wasn't that good for the weekend but we were lucky, at least until we were going home on Sunday.  We didn't arrive until around 3pm on Friday so just had a mooch around the town and later a walk along both beaches, Llandudno has two beaches, North shore is where you will find the pier and all those lovely Victorian buildings, the West shore is much quieter.  We walked down towards the West shore as the sun was going down and were treated to a wonderful sunset.The weather was a bit unsettled on Saturday morning but the forecast said it was going to be better in the afternoon, so we explored the town some more before taking the tram up the Great Orme in the afternoon.  We decided we would walk back down and stop to visit the mines, which are at the half way point.  These Bronze Age mines were discovered in 1987 after work was started following planning permission to build a car park.  There are around 4 miles of tunnels under this area, a small section is open to the public and the work is still on-going to discover more about the area.  It was an interesting place to visit, although Mark's not keen on confined spaces and was glad to see daylight at the end of the tunnel!We carried on walking down, back towards Llandudno, which wasn't as bad as I thought It would be, although we did take one of the easier routes, but I can now claim to have walked the Orme :-) The weather was beautiful when we got up on Sunday morning, really warm and sunny and I was pleased we had decided to wait until today for our visit to Bodnant Gardens.   After breakfast we packed our bag and set straight off.  Bodnant is around 6 miles from Llandudno but we did take the scenic route along Marine Drive, around The Great Orme, so it was more miles but well worth it for the views .  I've shared photos of this route before, Here , we didn't stop to take any on Sunday.  We did stop at the church of ST Tudno to enjoy the view for a while though.There is a beautiful Manor House in Bodnant Gardens, unfortunately it isn't open to the public, the grounds are stunning though with different walks and gardens to explore, I loved looking at all the different plants and shrubs and in the garden centre on the way out I did buy a couple of plants for our garden.Unfortunately the good weather didn't last long enough for us to enjoy all that was on offer, the rain started and at first it looked as though it might blow over but then it quickly got heavier and we had to head into the coffee shop.  Such a shame because there were another two walks we could have done if it had stayed nice.  We will definitely be back in the area again though and will plan a future visit.Have a good week all-X-"},
{"title": "Monday makes", "date": "Monday 18 July 2022", "text": "This past week I've finished two things off my July list.  The first is this cute little bunnyI came across the free pattern months ago on the Tilda website and intended to make it to put in Bonnie's Easter bag.  I got it all cut out and half sewn together and then put it away because it was fiddly and I wasn't in the right frame of mind and I also doubted myself being able to do it.I'm glad I made the effort, it was fiddly but I took my time and now I love her!I gave her a little bow and sewed ric rac around the hem of her dress.She will be added to Bonnie's birthday bag, although I am very tempted to keep her :-)I also finished the baby blanket I was making for my friends son and his partner.  They are welcoming a baby girl in October.  I asked her if I could make something and she said she thought they would love that, I know not everyone likes knitted baby clothes so I wanted to make sure.I opted for a simple corner to corner garter stitch blanket.  I made one of these for each of my grandchildren and the girls loved them, they were a perfect size for a new born, not too big or heavy.  It's knitted in The Women's Institute DK Yarn from Hobbycraft , I used two 100g balls, It knits up lovely and is really soft, a little bit thicker than the usual DK, but that's ok.  I got this when It was on the 3 for 2 offer, I also had a £2.50 voucher to use so the blanket didn't cost anything.  I will knit a cardigan with the other ball and gift it to them nearer the time.We are in the middle of a heatwave here in the UK, according to the news The Midlands has been issued it's first ever red warning for extreme heat.  Over the next couple of days they have predicted the temperatures to be around 38°, it's 27° indoors at the moment so I can imagine it would be high 30's outside, It might not seem very high temperatures to some but houses in the UK are built to keep the heat IN and we don't have A/C in our homes, you might find it in places of work but there is just no call for it in our homes.  I've got all the curtains and blinds closed, windows and doors open and the fan going, circulating the warm air, lol.  The poor cats don't know where to lie, even Molly, who is a sun worshiper, is spending more time in the shade.  It looks as though It's set to break by Wednesday though, I can grin and bear it for a few days.I'll leave you with just a couple of photos from my garden, the hydrangeas are flowering now, although wilting a bit in today's heat, the pink one has less flowers open at the moment.  The wildflowers are flowering at last and are so tall, I'm really pleased I sowed these. Take care-X-"},
{"title": "More socks", "date": "Monday 11 July 2022", "text": "I finished another pair of socks last week.  These are one of the three pairs I cast on in June, they were already knitted to the heel so didn't take too long to complete, I have one more pair of that June trio to finish and then I'd like to start on the Christmas socks for family.The yarn is West Yorkshire Spinners Signature 4ply in the colourway Robin, the contrast cuffs heels and toes are also WYS, in the colourway Turmeric.For this pair I cast on 72 stitches and decreased to 68 stitches once I'd knit the rib, they seem to fit fine but I definitely need the extra stitches on the ribbing.Yesterday I was working in the garden until mid afternoon so everything is looking tidy and I was able to sit and enjoy some time outside and admire my hard work.I think this fleabane is my favourite plant in the garden at the moment, I bought it as a small plant from a National Trust place last year, I've not seen it for sale anywhere else but I'd love to get some more If I come across it.I hope you have a lovely week, the weather is supposed to be lovely all week so enjoy.-X-"},
{"title": "Hello July", "date": "Sunday 3 July 2022", "text": "I finished the socks I was working on last week.  Absolutely love this colourway, the yarn is by Tea Cup Yarns in the colourway Beach Ball.  In hindsight I should have knitted the heels toes and cuffs in a contrast yarn, It would have highlighted the lovely colours more I think.   There is enough yarn left over to knit a shorty pair so perhaps I could make some and try that out.As with other socks, I knitted the heel from the tutorial by Crafthouse magic on Youtube, as I've done this heel a few times I can now knit it without referring to the tutorial.I tried a different toe, from a Kay Jones pattern this time.  It leaves more stitches to kitchener but I don't mind that, and as with the heel, I can now kitchener without having to look it up, so I'm happy to have learned a couple of useful techniques so far in my sock knitting journey.I like the little detail this toe produces.The other thing I've done this past week is to make a liner for a wicker basket.The basket had been in the garage for a while, I bought It from a charity shop a couple of years ago to keep my advent minis in, It was just a plain basket but to brighten it up I painted it white.With the help of Youtube I made a liner for it, It was far easier than I imagined it would be and now I have cute storage to keep my sock project in, and my yarn doesn't keep rolling around the floor, bonus!Plans for July - I had thought about taking part in Christmas in July but have now changed my mind.  Instead I'm going to focus on getting a few things completed, starting with those socks in the basket above.Once those are off the needles I will work through my list and see how many I can get crossed off by the end of July.  My aim this year was not to carry any projects over from 2022 so I need to be mindful of finishing projects now that we are into the second half of the year.  Another pair of socks - (already knitted down to the heel)  Baby blanket - (already over half way)  Fully finish Prairie Schooler Santas stitched last year  Whitmoor jumper - (just the sleeves to knit)  Wildflower stitching - (this is in time-out, I have to unpick a section I miscounted)  Bonnie's birthday bunny - (needs sewing together and dress making)  Take at least 2 finished stitched pieces to be framed - (on it, one already taken in on Friday)What do you think? I think everything on my list except for the Wildflower stitching is doable.  I need to be in the right frame of mind to unpick the stitches I miscounted and put the piece in a scroll frame, I was using a snap frame and it wasn't holding the fabric tight enough for me.  I do love the piece and would like to get it finished this year If I can.  I'd love to hear about your crafting plans for July, If you have any.-X-"},
{"title": "A simple day", "date": "Monday 27 June 2022", "text": "Today has been one of those day's when I felt I was on the winning side.  I went to bed really early last night, I was shattered after working in the garden for most of the day, I was too tired to even knit once I sat down so took myself off for an early night.   Mark finished painting the Summer house and shed while I worked in the garden.  He started painting on Saturday, it rained on and off but that part of the garden is sheltered by the tree so he could carry on, it was really windy though and I think he'd had enough of being out there.  It needs another coat when he's back at the weekend but, it looks so much better already I think.I felt so much better this morning after my early night, I got through all the jobs on my list and even managed to do a pile of ironing before lunchtime too 😇It was while I was ironing that I thought about summer stitching, (my mind wonders and random thoughts pass through my brain when I'm ironing!!)It wasn't all work today, I had a lovely relaxing afternoon knitting and watching the new Downton Abbey film and then later watched the boys for a hour while Jenny and James went to the open evening at the school for when Arty starts in September. A simple but lovely day, lets hope the rest of the week is just as good.How has your day been?-X-"},
{"title": "Just a quiet Thursday", "date": "Thursday 23 June 2022", "text": "I've just come up to sit in my summer house with a coffee and my knitting for a while before it's time to start making my tea, just a chicken salad tonight, I don't cook much when it's just me in the week, something quick and simple is fine.   I have three pairs of socks cast on at the moment, they are all knit down to the start of the heel flap so I can now work on them in turn to knit the heels and then the foot part.  This is the Beach ball colourway from Tea Cup Yarns which was a recent purchase from Wool@j13.   I think the colours are so pretty, here they are close up with the cute little ladybird progress keeper I made.I gave my little summer house a make over yesterday, It was unintentional, I had only planned on a good clean but then ended up painting all the inside, one job always leads to another with me, do you do that, start a small job and it ends up bigger?  I always seem to make work for myself.   Mark Is going to paint the outside at the weekend if the weather holds out, at least now it will look fresh inside and out. I noticed yesterday when I was watering that I had two teeny tiny strawberries, can you see them?  I had to look hard, lol, not worth getting the cream out for but they did taste nice.  There are more to come but I don't think any of them will be winning any prizes.I had a cinema date with Oliver yesterday, we went to see the new Jurassic World filmIn truth It was me who wanted to see it more than him but I thought people would think me a little strange going on my own so I went undercover of taking Oliver, ha ha.  I really enjoyed it, but then I enjoyed the previous two films, and anything to do with dinosaurs I find fascinating.The weather is set to break tomorrow with showers predicted but at the moment the sun is still shinning lovely so I'm going to finish my coffee, knit a few more rounds on my sock and enjoy the last bit of the days sunshine.-X-"},
{"title": "Whats in the garden", "date": "Monday 20 June 2022", "text": "Our garden is far from perfect and it's certainly not neat but I'm very happy with how everything is growing at the moment. The Nasturtiums I grew from seed are filling the kitchen window baskets lovely and just producing flowers now, I'll definitely grow those again next year.  The Marigolds are just starting to fill out, I sowed two packets and thought It would be too many but in hindsight it was just enough.   I'm excited to see what wildflowers appear, the tub is overflowing with greenery so fingers crossed for some lovely colour and food for the bees.   The lavender that Stevie was going to throw out because she said it was dead is very much alive and thriving, its already outgrown the pot I planted it in.   I'ts the only lavender plant I have in the garden and I'm tempted to get more, if I can find a space.   I think my favourites at the moment are the Erigeron Stallone, those pink and white daisy flowers are so pretty, it's common name of Fleabane doesn't do it justice at all.  The Oxalis is another favourite, I know Its considered a weed by many people but I love it, this one has green leaves and lovely pink flowers, It is in a container though as I wouldn't want it all over the garden.   The weather is fine and dry today, the rain and cooler temperatures at the weekend were a welcome relief after the heat of last week, that was a little too much for my liking.  I'm all caught up with housework and sorting so after doing just the necessary things this morning I've had a day pleasing myself, knitting on my socks, hopefully they will be finished to share with you next time.What are you loving in your garden at the moment?-X-"},
{"title": "Cancelled flights and surprise guests ", "date": "Friday 17 June 2022", "text": "Indulge me with one more post about the wedding and holiday, It's all worth a mention and writing a blog post means that I will be able to look back on it. You may have see or read about the flight disruptions that are happening at airport around the UK, we had anticipated long queues at security on our outbound flight but that all went quite well and we were only delayed by 40 minutes. I was the first time on an airplane for Bonnie, Jacob and Arty.  They all did really well managing to stay awake the whole time, kept entertained with tablets and games. Once we landed in Paphos we had over an hours wait for our baggage to come through as several flights landed in quick succession, it meant that we didn't arrive at our hotel until around 2.30am.  We were all very travel weary but to the hotels credit they dealt with our arrival very efficiently, we were allocated room keys quickly, given a food package and our bags were taken up to our rooms, it was much appreciated given the late hour.Jumping ahead to our flight home for a moment because that's a tale and a half.....  Our hotel pick up was 9pm, by the time we arrived at the airport we already knew that our flight had been cancelled but were not told what was going to happen, nothing was appearing on the screens, it was only by talking to other passengers, some of whom had received text messages that we found out that another plane had been arranged for us, a Spanish airline was coming from Larnaca, (this flight already had passengers so they were being diverted to pick us up!).  We eventually boarded at 5.15am, six hours after we should have taken off!  That was bad enough, hanging around an airport when everyone is tired is no fun, but when we landed we then sat on the airplane for 2 hours because although they had put the steps out for us to disembark, there was no bus to transport us to the terminal.  It was only when the pilot got fed-up waiting, got off and caused a fuss, (his crew had been on duty for 25 hours (!)  that a bus magically appeared.  You would think we had endured enough, but no, we had to wait another hour and a half for our bags to come through.  There are now hoops to jump through to claim compensation, we'll start that joy process tomorrow. So, back to the holiday/wedding...Given the hour we went to bed we didn't have a very early start to our first day, but the next morning we discovered that our room had a great view of the main pool.  There were two other pools besides this one and one for children as well as water slides.Although It was a lovely place with a great choice of food on offer and plenty to entertain, I'd say it was a place for younger people and couples with young families, I would have preferred something with less going on, but we weren't there for me.Jenny, James and the boys stayed at a different hotel, apart from the wedding day we did also get together a few time over the week.  The complex they were at was definitely more for families, the boys had a blast.They all had a great time enjoying all the activities, Jacob took a bit longer to get adjusted.We went down to the beach one day with Bonnie and Jacob.  Jacob winged the whole time, first it was \"I no like a water\"Then it was,\"I no like a sand\" (I'm with him on that one though, lol)Then on the way back it was \"I no like a walk\"Bonnie on the other hand would have been happy to stay and play there all day.Everyone got together for a meal in the town the night before the wedding.  Darren had bought a colourful holiday shirt to wear and thought he was going to be the only one, little did he know that Stevie had asked others to wear one too.  I had to buy Mark one, sneak it in the case and give it him to wear on the night, he would have said no way otherwise.  As it turned out I did good, he said he quite liked it, sometimes you've just got to make the decision for them, ha ha.  By the way, James is the one with his arm in a sling, but that's a story for another time.Two of Darren's friends and their girlfriends surprised him at the airport on the way out, he had no idea they were coming, Stevie has had to keep it quiet about it for months, and then there was another surprise for him at the night before the wedding mealHis cousin and girlfriend had booked to come over for a few days for the wedding and arranged with Stevie to surprise him, they walked in just after we sat downBoth Darren's parents passed away quite young, both were only in their early 50's.  His dad died quite suddenly two years ago while on holiday and his mother just as suddenly last October.    He was close to both of them and it's been difficult for him.Two of his aunty's, his mums sisters, and their daughters and children came over for the wedding.  His mum's brother couldn't make it so when his cousin turned up it was quite emotional.  I'm so glad that he had extended family to share the day with him, I know attending a wedding abroad isn't ideal for a lot of people but knowing they had make the effort made it extra special.Stevie and Darren will be coming home on Sunday, hopefully they will not have the hassle of cancelled flights and delay's that we experienced.   They have had a fantastic time, been on a few excursions and made some lovely memories.I'm so proud of them, they both worked hard to buy their first house and over a couple of years fixed it up beautifully, with help from dad, of course😉  That first house then gave them the step up to enable them to buy a brand new house last year.Stevie also starts a new job next week with Social Services, in the Children's Sector.  Since university she has worked first as a nursery nurse and then more recently as Deputy Manager of the nursery.  From a little girl she always wanted to work with children, I'm happy that she followed her dream and is doing something she loves.  Of my three girls Stevie is the more easy going and laid back one but has a quiet determination to achieve what she sets out to do.  This new job will be something different and more emotionally challenging but, I know she will give it her all.🥂"},

{"title": "Wildflowers update and a great book", "date": "Monday 9 May 2022", "text": "I only started this piece last Saturday but I thought If I posted regular progress updates it would keep me motivated to keep stitching.  I've only stitched on it twice during this past week and so far I'm loving all the bright colours.It's been a lovely few days and I spent Friday afternoon in the garden cutting the grass and doing a general tidy up.  We sowed grass seed on the bare patches and applied fertiliser to the lawn a few weeks ago, we didn't think the seed was taking but after all that rain last week it's now sprouting up, there are still some places it didn't take but we can try again after the next cut.  The fertiliser worked a treat, I've never seen our grass os green!We had all the bushes along the fence cut right down at the beginning of Spring, they were all tangled and a bit of a mess, they are starting to come back again now but won't flower this year, I'm ok with that, at least we can now try and keep them under control.I've been struggling with my book choices again lately, nothing I picked up was holding my interest, a search on Goodreads came up with this author, and this book had really good reviews so I ordered it from the library.  I'm always a bit wary of rave reviews but in this instance they were justified.  Set in Cumbria, The Puppet Show, a is a Police procedural and is the first book in a series with Detective Washington Poe as the main character.   Poe has been on suspension but strings are pulled to bring him back to help in the search for Immolation Man who so far has killed three men in horrific burning rituals.  When they find Poe's name carved into the chest of the third victim they assume he will be number 5.The book is very well written, not too gory and with a great twisty plot.  The characters are very likable, especially Tilly Bradshaw, the geeky techie, she somehow lightens the story giving the book moments where you can't help but smile. I'll definitely be reading the other books in the series.-X-"},
{"title": "Happy Bank Holiday ", "date": "Monday 2 May 2022", "text": "It's been a very busy Bank Holiday Weekend, starting with our meet up at the Nimble Thimble on Saturday.  There was a meet up last year but I didn't go to that one so I haven't seen these ladies in at least two years, maybe longer.  There was ten of us this time and It was lovely to be in the company of like minded people again and just to enjoy some uninterrupted stitching time.The Nimble Thimble is situated on the Welsh boarder and just over an hours drive away, it's a lovely drive, mostly through beautiful countryside.  The shop itself is in a lovely place by the river, with beautiful views all around.The shop is packed full of wonderful stitching goodies, you really are spoilt for choice, although on this particular visit I didn't buy anything, can you believe that!  I have been feeling a little overwhelmed of late with the amount of things I have and to buy yet more charts to just put into stash just wasn't sitting well with me, so I came away empty handed this this time.I did save my new start for Saturday though,  Wildflowers by The Blue Flower is a chart I purchased last year, the fabric I got at my visit to the NEC in March and as part of my Christmas present my daughter, Jenny had bought me all the threads for it.I managed to get the first five words stitched while at the meet up plus a bit more over Saturday evening.My fabric is 28 count and I think it's looking on the large side, the recommended fabric is 40 count, there is no way I would see the holes on that high count, an alternative was 36 count, which I can see but my eyes get tired when stitching on it and I'm not a fan of 32 count.  I'm hoping it will look better when I start adding the flowers.Stevie and Darren's wedding is getting ever closer, only a little over four weeks until we fly now!  The girls had organised a hen party for her on Saturday so I drove straight from the Nimble Thimble to meet them all at a local Greek restaurant where we had a lovely meal.  Following the meal they were all going on to a cocktail bar, I opted out of that part of the night and left the younger ones to it.Day two of the Hen weekend was The Bear Grylls Adventure at the NEC.   As the name suggests it's a place to take part in various activities and challenges, there's rock climbing, an assault course, swimming with sharks, zipwire, and indoor sky diving, plus others.Stevie had said she would like to do some kind of activity but some of the 'hens' couldn't be persuaded to join this part of the weekend so just six of us went yesterday.The activities are pre-booked and some of them we couldn't do because they were booked up, I would have liked to try shooting, but there were no places available yesterday.  The girls opted for the height ropes.  I'm not a fan of heights so sat and had a coffee while they did this one.Standing at 65 feet this is the tallest high ropes course in Europe.  It really didn't look very high from the ground but the girls said it certainly did from the top!!We did archery next and guess who excelled at that, lol.  I really enjoyed archery and would quite happily have carried on for longer than our allotted time.The girls did hammer throwing next which I sat out but wish I'd done now as they said it was really good then lastly we did the escape room challenge.  I thought I might like this but in reality It was too many people with ideas all talking at once, it wasn't for me.In between we went on the assault course and I've confirmed that my legs are no longer as strong as they once were, lol, although the instructor said we were the best group he had ever had and had given him a laugh, and we all had a great day.-X-"},

{"title": "A Friday outing", "date": "Saturday 2 April 2022", "text": "I took Arty out for the day yesterday, Jenny spends a lot of time on her own with the boys with James being away during the week, she had a few different errands to run and it's so much easier when you haven't got a toddler in tow.After the warm sunny days we were celebrating last week mother nature decided she wasn't done with Winter just yet and the temperatures plummeted.  We have had occasional flurries of snow with daytime temperatures or around 6 or 7°C and minus temps at night.  My granny always said you should never leave your vest off until May, ha, ha.It was bright and sunny yesterday at least so we went for a walk around Haden Hill park, ( I've posted about Haden Hill before), the cold must have put people off because we virtually had the park to ourselves.  I took a bag of bread to feed the ducks, there are two pools, one near the house and one in the parkland, the ducks couldn't get enough, some even came out of the water to make sure they got their share.We saw a sign to say the Haden Hill House Museum was open for viewing, I've visited previously but not for many years, entry is free so we decided to go and have a look around.The Library was Mr Haden Best's domainThis room would have been used as the dining roomThe Morning Room where the lady of the house would prepare for the day, write letters do her needlework and have afternoon teaLove the needlework station The Housekeepers ParlorUpstairs was the Drawing Room, or Withdrawing Room.  After dinner this is where the family and guest would sit and talk, play games and perhaps listen to someone playing the piano.It look like a lovely cosy room but the chairs don't look as though they would have been very comfortable.The lady's bedroomIn contrast, the servants bedroom looks very sparse, although I do like the patchwork quilt on the far bed The only other room that is open was a play room, children can play with all the toys and the dressing up clothes, Arty would have happily stayed in there all afternoon.Once we got back to the car the ice cream van had arrived, you can still have an ice cream in the cold when you're three, :-)We went into town after our walk, I'd promised Arty to take him to feed the squirrels, unfortunately they didn't want to eat out of his hand today, but they did come pretty close and I think he was happy to see one close up.I think I enjoyed the day just as much as Arty, it was nice to get out in the fresh air.-X-"},

Now someone enters her life who could finally be the reason she needs to overcome her fears.From post-revolution Romania to the idyllic English countryside, The World at My Feet is the story of two women, two worlds, and a journey of self-discovery that spans a lifetime. My audio book for February was one I came across via a new podcast I've been watching, Penelope's Chinwag.  Pene's podcast was recommended on another one I subscribe to, so I thought I'd pop over and take a look, and I'm so glad I did, she has a lovely way about her and she shows her amazing patchwork, knitting and sewing as well as some chats with her 96 year old mum.  I love listening to those chats, it makes me wish I'd done something similar with my mum.  Her podcast is well worth checking out if you haven't already.In one episode she mentioned that her aunty in Ireland had written a book, when she said that it was on audible I went in search and downloaded it.Open Hearted by Anne Ingle is a very candid memoir, narrated by Ann herself.  I found it absolutely fascinating listening to her and can highly recommend.   I've checked on Amazon where it's also available in hardback and on Kindle too.At 20 Londoner Ann Ingle fell madly in love with an Irish fellow she met on holiday in Cornwall. At the church to arrange their shotgun wedding she discovered that he hadn't even told her his real name.Sixty-odd years later Ann looks back on that first glorious fall and in a series of essays considers what she has learned from the life that followed - bringing eight children into the world, their father's years of mental illness and tragic death at 40, being a cash-strapped single mother in 1980s Dublin, coming into her own in her middle years - going to college, working and writing, and continuing to evolve and learn into her ninth decade, even as she accepts the realities of being 'old'.These two books bring my reading total to 10 so far this year, you can find the link to my Goodreads page in the right hand side bar if you're interested in what else I've been reading.-x-"},
{"title": "Half term week", "date": "Sunday 27 February 2022", "text": "Last week was half term here and as Joanne was at work I looked after Bonnie and arranged for us to do a few activities during the week.  On Tuesday we had a day out to Blist Hill Ironbridge Gorge museums.  Blist Hill is a Victorian Town living museum, similar to The Blackcounty living museum I've blogged about before Here.  I think I preferred it, there were people in each of the shops and all were friendly and very knowledgeable about the era.  On Thursday I managed to get us tickets for the pantomime, Snow White, at the local Town Hall.  Panto's usually happen around Christmas time and into January but I think this one, which raises money for a local hospise, usually happens at the February half term, we were at the last show.  As you can see from the last photo we ended up with balcony seats, it's not a huge venue so that's not really a problem, and Bonnie could see because there were children in front of her seat, but, I had a giant of a woman in front of me!  This is the view I had of the stage if I sat straight in my chair, yeah, not good, I spent the whole time leaning towards Bonnie's chair so I could see.On Friday I took Bonnie and Arty to a local garden centre where they decorated a teracotta pot in which they then planted some sunflower seeds.  Arty was so pleased with his, of course he had to draw a slug and a worm on there too, ha ha.At last the wind has died down and the rain stopped, there has been flooding in both Ironbridge and Bewdley.  I love visiting Bewdley and feel terrible for the residents on the river, the flood barriers on the one side were not enough to stop the water and yet again their houses were flooded.Image taken from googleThe road between the buildings is the one we usually take to get into the town when we visit, the white house on the right has only just been renovated after the last time it was flooded.  It must be just so awful, and scary.  Luckily the flood barriers on the otherside of the river were higher and held back the water this time.  I've read today that the water levels are now falling but there will be a lot of clean-up work to follow.-X-"},

Awww, I wanted to bring him home and Arty has decided he would like one for his birthday.Not too sure that he will be granted that particular birthday wish.-X-"},

Brett Driftwood DK, I had a ball of that tucked away so decided to make use of it.I love the way it knitted up , and it's perfect tucked inside a jacket.  The yarn is so soft you don't even know it's there, I would definitely knit this pattern again, it was a simple repeat, easy to memorise and knit up in no time at all.  Now all I need is some weather cold enough for me to wear it!The shade is DW01 and the Snuggle Down Cowl pattern can be found on Ravelry, (paid for pattern)I had a lovely quiet weekend, I was going to go out on Saturday but changed my mind and instead I pottered around the house.  I watched two of my DVD's over the weekend and I had a lazy Monday watching the third one.Alfie and Sex And The City I hadn't seen previously but really enjoyed them, I think everyone has seen Forrest Gump but I'd forgotten what a great film it is, thoroughly enjoyed it all over again, and Tom Hanks looks so young, lolThey were a great buy at three for £1, they have now gone into the charity bag for someone else to enjoy.  I will be on the look out for others when I go into town next.The de-cluttering is continuing, the loft threw up a big box of photos that I have been slowly going through, bringing back some lovely memories.  I don't want to put these back up the loft so they are sitting in piles on the dining table waiting to be put in albums.  There is one more box up the loft to go through and then that can be crossed off my list. Three wordrobes have been sorted and rearanged, it's evident that we have too many clothes!  I did donate a bag full to charity, so that's cleared a bit of space but I'm always reluctant to get rid of clothes, other items, If they are not used, I have no problem with, but clothes I seem to hang on to for some reason.What do you hang on to that you should clear out?-X-"},

Thank you Jo. xThe two items below were from my sister.  I know they won't be everyone's cup of tea but I love them! When we were clearing out Mum's house, me and my sister had gone into town to see if the charity shops were taking donations, (as there was a threat of another lockdown a lot of charity shops weren't  taking donations).  We walked into one and these were just sitting on the shelf, it was truly serendipity!  Mum had a cheese dish in the same design which was my granny's, (Jenny, my eldest daughter now has that) but, we had been talking about how granny had a biscuit barrel to match and no one knew what had happened to it , and the next day we walk into the shop and here is the biscuit barrel I remember sitting in my granny's china cabinet, well I just had to have it, and the butter dish had to come home with me too because it is just so cute! My sister said If I wanted them she would get them as part of my birthday present, of course I said yes please :-)Like I say, they probably don't appeal to a lot of people but they remind me of my granny and my mum too now, who I think guided me to that shop that day.I have my granny's china cabinet and they will eventually live in there but, for the moment they are on my kitchen window where I can admire themOne last special gift.  With so many birthday's in December my mum had already put out all the money for them, so this is my last present from Mum.  I have no idea what I will buy yet but I will put the money towards something special.I also got a cold for my birthday :-(I felt like I was coming down with it when I got up in the morning, we don't think of a common cold anymore though do we?  But I tested twice yesterday and this morning and It is a cold.Everyone came round at lunch time to partake of sandwiches and cake but by the time they went I was feeling quite rough.  I was in bed at 8.30pm and had a lie in this morning.  I feel a lot better now, I did test again this morning, (still negative). I just think with everything that's been going on, together with late nights and early mornings I've probably been doing too much.This afternoon though I'm putting my feet up, watching a film and stitching!Hope you have all had a wonderful Christmas-X="},

{"title": "Yarn Advents", "date": "Thursday 9 December 2021", "text": "I was rather greedy last year and had four yarn advents.  Three of them I purchased and one was a swap with my lovely friend Jo.  A lot of yarn dyers seemed to put their advents up for sale very early in the year this time and I just wasn't ready to think about Christmas in March.  Yarn advents have also got very expensive this year, I'm not saying that the price isn't justified, there is a lot of  planning and hard work involved in putting them together and they do have to put together multiple Advent boxes.  One of he reasons I didn't buy one this year is because I've tried to be a bit more mindful of what craft supplies I've bought all year.  There are only so many things you can use at a time and I no longer see the sense in having a large stash of things that I won't get around to using, must be an age thing, ha ha.It's still lovely to have something to open leading up to Christmas though, so I made my own. Throughout the year I bought mini skeins when I've seen some I've liked and put them away unopened.  When Oliver came for a sleep over last time I gave him the job of putting together my Advent for me, It did cost me more in sweets as it was a case of one in the bag, one for Oliver, lol  But he did a great job and enjoyed doing it too.I've been doing a yarn Advent swap with Jo for a few years now, (is this the third year Jo?)  I do look forward to this because it is more personal, and I love putting things together for Jo in return.  Look at the lovely box of goodies Jo sent me :-)There was also a box in there for my birthday, which is safety hidden until after Boxing day ;-)Thank you so much Jo, everything looks lovely and I'm really enjoying opening the little packets each day.Here are my Advents days 1 to 9 from JoAnd here are days 1 to 9 of the one I did myselfAnd most unusual for me, I haven't had a single chocolate yet!  I'm going to save them up and indulge on Christmas Eve.As you all know, there has been lots to do and sort out these last few weeks, we have just about got things done now and we will be saying our final goodbyes to mum on Tuesday.  Christmas won't be the same this year that's for sure but, It's been nice to have something to look forward to open of an evening when I finally sit down.-x-"},
{"title": "Finishing the projects", "date": "Saturday 4 December 2021", "text": "Thank you for your messages of condolence following my last blog post, they all meant so much to me.  There has been so much to do this last week, things to take care of and things to decide on.         We are getting there, slowly.  It's not a nice job going through a parents belongings, and of course there is all the furniture too.  With the best will in the world it's impossible for us to keep everything, a lot will have to go to charity, we have tried as much as possible to donate items to animal charities, mum loved all animals so we are thinking that by donating there mum is also helping the animals she loved.******** This is not how I imagined my December would be and I'm so glad that I managed to get all my Christmas shopping done by December 1st, at least I don't have the added stress of gift shopping.  I promise myself every year that I will have it all done by December 1st but it never happens, except this year It did, how strange.I thought before we got any further into the final month of 2021 I would share a couple of finishes with you.  I resisted starting anything new, although towards the middle of November I was itching to, I knew I had things prepared ready to start on the 1st of the month so that kept me focused.First was this cardigan for JacobThere wasn't a lot to do on this to get it finished, I stalled because I was getting close to the end and I dread the sewing up.  I go great guns at a new project then when I'm getting close to the end I start thinking about the sewing up and suddenly I loose interest, does anyone else do that?  Once I set my mind to finishing it it didn't take too long, good job as it won't have much growing room.Next to get finished was something I started in JulyBonnie was looking through a crochet book and asked for a lion.  I made the head, stuffed it and sewed on all the various bits, then I got distracted.  It had sat on the dining table since July because I knew I'd done the hardest part, all the rest was straightforward and I thought If it was sat there I might feel inclined to finish it.  Three months later, it's done.He didn't have a mouth stitched on in the book and now I'm looking and thinking he might look better with one?  Bonnie was happy with him anyway.I can't even remember when I started my next finish, I do remember starting it to try and use up some bright coloured Stylecraft Special DK I had.  It only took me a couple of nights to get finished in the end and now Bonnie has a lovely little blanket for her dolls.I finished off two more projects since writing this blog post but I will have to keep those for another time as I haven't got round to taking any photos of them yet. I'll try and pop back again later in the week if I can as I also have some lovely advents to share.-X-"},
{"title": "Mum", "date": "Sunday 28 November 2021", "text": "I'm so very sad to tell you that my mum passed away in the early hours of Thursday 25th November. As you know mum went into respite care a few weeks ago following a fall and a rapid decline in her mobility.  Whilst in the care home it became clear that she wasn't going to regain even the limited mobility she had had previously and there was talk of her remaining in the care home where she could have round the clock care, although it was a big change for her she did realise that she needed more care than we could safely provide for her at home.   The week before she went into respite she had been assessed and diagnosed with both Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, although this was still in the early stages, there were days when she got very confused and mixed up, it was hard to see her memory getting worse.The photo below was taken about 5 years ago at my niece's wedding.We are grateful that when the end came she was not in pain.  For a good few days she had kept saying that she was so tired, and when she was put to bed on Wednesday night she became unresponsive a few hours later.  She never fully regained consciousness, only occasionally opening her eyes but not acknowledging or speaking to us.  In life she was a quiet person who got on with things and didn't want drama, so it was no surprise that when she passed it was quietly, without fuss.  We were with her the whole time, holding her hands and talking to her.  I'd like to think that she knew she was not alone and that we were there.28th August 1928 - 25th November 2021Good night, God bless mum-X-"},
{"title": "Beating them at their own game", "date": "Monday 8 November 2021", "text": "I realised as I was looking through my blog posts the other day that I hadn't told you the rest of the story about Marks car being stolen, I thought it would amuse you.  First off let me say that i'm not the most observant person, I would make a terrible PI, you will see why.  Mark had been suffering a bad back that weekend and as we have a memory foam mattress in the second bedroom he had slept in there on Sunday night to see if it would help, that bedroom overlooks the garden.  I got up as normal on Monday morning and opened the curtains, our bedroom faces the front and overlooks the drive.  I didn't realise at first that Mark was still in bed having decided to go in later because his back was still playing up.  I had to pop out so I left him where he was and off I went.  He called me around 10.30am and said 'where's my car?'  I thought he was having me on so I said what do you mean? it's on the drive.  Only it wasn't.  He had got to the front door with his bag only to find his car gone.  I had opened the curtains in the bedroom and not noticed, gone out to my car, which I park right next to his car on our drive and not noticed or registered that his car wasn't there but he was in the house!!!I was on my way home when he called me and he had been on the phone to the office to tell them and was trying to get through to the police to report it stolen.    Now, the car has a tracker, so the office knew what time it had moved off our drive, where it was and what time it had been parked up and they called Mark back to tell him.....It had moved off our drive at 9.05pm, the engine started at 9.10pm and was parked up at 9.40pm.I'd been sitting in the back sitting room watching the last episode of Handmaid's Tale so wouldn't have heard anything going on at the front of the house but Mark had been sat in the front room and not heard a thing! (I think you could safely say neither of us would make good PI's) lol.We have since found out that these keyless cars are very easy to steal, thieves use a device to pick up a signal from the keys in the house, all they have to do is stand on the drive and look for a signal and the car door can be unlocked.   Now Mark's car is one of those big Navara's, when it starts up you can hear it, he would have heard it, our drive has a slight slope to it so we think they must have rolled it back and let it roll as far as it would and then started it away from the house.  It was then driven less than 10 miles and left on a side road on a small estate.That's apparently what they are doing now, stealing a vehicle parking it up somewhere and waiting to see if anyone comes for it, if it's still there in a couple of days they go back and collect it and do whatever it is they do with stolen cars!  But, as we knew where it was from the tracker we drove there and low and behold his car was parked up, nothing damaged, all his tools in the back, everything still as it was inside, except his phone charger, they had taken that (!)Lucky or what!? Another thing we didn't know, if you have a keyless car your 'key' should be kept in something metal to block the signal.  Lesson learned  -X-"},
{"title": "A beautiful day in October", "date": "Saturday 30 October 2021", "text": "Today started dull and wet but by mid morning it started to look as though that was clearing so I decided to take a drive to Stourport.  I think I've blogged a few times about Stourport, mainly when I've had children in tow, but today was just for me.There is a high street at Stourport and a selection of shops, not many, but just enough for locals and after a quick look in a couple of charity shops I made my way to a lovely little cafe which sits right on the edge of the canal.Considering we are at the end of October we have still been having the odd nice sunny day, and it was warm enough to sit outside and have my coffee, toast and cake.I've never walked this part of the canal before but after today it's certainly somewhere I'll come back to walk again.Just a little way past this lock are some canal side apartments and houses and as the canal runs along the back of the high street some of shops and pubs also back onto the canal further along.I had walked for about half an hour when it started to get a bit muddy so I decided to go back and see what was over that bridge in the photo above.When my daughter, Stevie, saw these photos she said it looked pretty but spooky, there wasn't anyone around but it didn't feel strange or spooky to me, just quiet and peaceful.The newer building you can see on the right is the church, St Michael & All Angels, but over the wall I could see a ruin, so of course I had to go and investigate.I love how the new church stands inside the ruins but couldn't find any information about the ruins on the site, It isn't the Mitton Chapel because the information sign for that said it was demolished after the 1st world war and only footings remain.Once I got home this is what I found out about the ruins:By the end of the 19th century a larger church was needed and In the 1880's work was started by John Oldrid Scott to build the church his grandfather, Sir G. G. Scott designed.  Although the church was consecrated in 1910 the building was never completed.  It was badly damaged in a storm in 1976 and a few years later was mostly demolished to make way for the current church to be built inside the ruins.  The new church, St Michael & All Angels is the fourth one known to have existed on the site.It's quite an historic site but a sad story for the ruins don't you think?I really enjoyed getting out in the fresh air, I always seem to find an excuse not to go anywhere but I must make the time and effort, I feel so much better for it.-X-"},
{"title": "Autumn leaves and afternoon teas", "date": "Friday 29 October 2021", "text": "I don't have my Monday outings with Bonnie now because she has started school,  but this week has been half term so we had a day out together yesterday.  She is such good company and no trouble at all.  We went to feed the ducks first, because of being in isolation and then straight back into everything whats going on with mum, It feels like forever since I've been out and about so it was lovely to walk in the fresh air and see all the lovely Autumn colours.The weather is still really mild, still not cold enough for a coat but It was rather windy, hence Bonnie is wearing one of Nanny's hat knits :-)There were lots of Canadian Geese, more than I've seen there before, all eager to eat the food we bought along.Later, for a treat, I took Bonnie for afternoon tea at a cafe call Mad Hatters.  As the name suggests the place is decked out with all things Alice in Wonderland.  I've blogged about this place before, we had Joanne's baby shower there when she was expecting Jacob, but this time of year it was also dressed for Halloween.Bonnie likes cute Halloween, but isn't too keen on scary Halloween, she was impressed with her afternoon tea though.  There was quite a lot there for a little person but we were able to take a doggy bag home, so nothing went to waste.While we were at the park we collected rather a lot of leaves and once home we spent a few hours coating some of the best ones in diluted PVA glue, I think Joanne is going to make a garland out of them now they are dry, the coating of glue has bought the colours out lovely.   We also decided to put some in the flower press too, no idea if they will survive, but we'll see in a few weeks.I really enjoyed our time together yesterday, it was lovely just to enjoy the day without rushing, and I think Bonnie had a good day too :-)-X-"},
{"title": "Dandelion cardigan, finished", "date": "Sunday 24 October 2021", "text": "It's been well over a year in the making, but at last it's finished!Lady Mademoiselle Dandelion Cardigan by Along Avec AnnaKnitted using Drops Nord in the colour number 07I raided my button stash and came up with this colourful arrangement and I like it :-)Someone asked me about the pattern last time I posted about this, the name is at the top of this post and you can find the paid for pattern on Ravelry.I'm still determined to get some more projects finished before I start anything new but I just haven't got the inclination to do much of anything right now.Covid fatigue has hit me, I didn't feel it whilst I had Covid but this last week it has been an effort to do anything at all, I feel so sluggish , my taste is coming back a little but I still can't smell anything.   On top of that we have reached another stage with mum.  I started going up again this week and it seems that she has deteriorated a little more, she couldn't even get to a standing position let alone walk this week but, to cut a very long story short, the doctor and the Occupational Therapist decided that a spell in respite would be helpful not only for us but for mum too.  She will go on Tuesday for two weeks and be assessed again towards the end of those two weeks.  She understands when you tell her but has forgotten again the next day so it's going to be hard but it's getting to the stage where she is not safe at home, she had a fall again the week before last, luckily she didn't suffer any injury, this time.On top of feeling so tired this week I've been straight back into my turn on the caring rota and dealing with all the phone calls to do with arranging respite, the memory clinic assessment, OT assessment, doctors as well as cancelling / re-arranging some appointment that mum had in the next couple of weeks.  I feel totally drained with it all, so forgive me if I don't visit or comment on you blogs for a while, I'm going to take these next two weeks to re-charge my batteries and hopefully find some energy from somewhere.See you soonEdited...And just to add to everything going on, we got up this morning to find that Marks car had been stolen during the night, his tools, job files everything, gone! Sigh-X-"},
{"title": "Isolation, almost over", "date": "Saturday 16 October 2021", "text": "My ten day isolation is almost up, they tell you to count from the fist day you felt unwell but as I didn't feel too bad I started counting from when my positive result came back as that was the day that I thought it was a cold, which means that my last day is tomorrow.I must admit that I've not missed going out at all, I could easily become a hermit I think, lolJenny and Stevie did the food shop for me last week and Mark has gone this morning, I've saved a fortune as people only bring whats on a list, and I haven't missed shopping in the least, it's not my favourite thing to do at the best of times.I still feel very stuffy, especially when I first get up but that clears as the day goes on, my cough is still there, not too bad but from what I've read it can hang around a while.  NHS test and trace have called me every couple of days, (very nice of them, ha, ha) and apparently you only have to carry on isolating after the ten days if you are sneezing, have a runny nose or diarrhea, I have none of these so normal life for me can resume from Monday.  Although, I still plan on wearing a mask when I'm around mum and at Jenny's when I pick Oliver up, just to be on the safe side.It's been like having a bad cold, I did have a funny head a few day's, not a headache more like a vertigo feeling, paracetamol usually took that off .  I started to paint the kitchen just before all this happened and I've managed to finish that by doing a bit each day so you can tell that I got it mild, thank goodness.  I didn't loose my sense of taste or smell until last weekend, It was Sunday when I noticed it.  It really is the weirdest thing, I can't smell anything at all and all food tastes the same, it is really peculiar.The girls sent me a couple of care packages.  I love Tea Pigs tea so will be saving that until my taste and smell return.  I haven't started the book yet but it sounds good, I let you know.And this one arrived this week, I'm going to save the bath salts, bath melts and hand gel until I can smell, it would be a waste not to smell them wouldn't it!Other than slowly painting the kitchen I've been filling my time knitting on my cardigan, (almost finished) and watching The Handmaids Tale on Amazon Prime.  I didn't watch this when it was on TV, I somehow didn't think it would be my thing, but I am enjoying binge watching now.The weather has been lovely for a few days and after Mark came back from the supermarket this morning we've spent a couple of hours tidying the garden up, lots of things to cut back and leaves to get up, the green bin is full, I think we perhaps have one more collection before they stop for this year so wanted to make the most of that.Hope you are all having a lovely weekend-X-"},
{"title": "A Friday finish", "date": "Friday 8 October 2021", "text": "Autumn Dream by Cottage Garden Samplings The Songbird's Garden Series # 11Stitched on 36 count Vintage Country Mocha using the called for Weeks Dye threadsI found the frame in a charity shop early in the Summer, It's not very often you come across square frames and I knew it would be the perfect size for this piece.  Although, I would like opinions on the colour, it's brighter than I first thought, do you think it's too bright? should I paint it and distress it?  If I paint it, what colour would you suggest?  At the moment the stitching is just pinned, not laced so that If I do need to paint the frame It won't be a problem.   Here's a close shot of the frame, I'd love to know what you think.It was this cute little pumpkin house that first drew me to the chart,and of course that Tufted TitmouseThe piece wasn't without it's problems to stitch, those Bittersweets look lovely but were a bit of a pain to stitch, I miscounted, a lot, some I ripped out and stitched again, others were fudged, the piece is so fluid I don't think you can tell.Isolating updateThank you to everyone that sent get well wishes on my last post to my daughter to Joanne, she is doing ok, she did have a bit of a melt down a couple of nights ago, more to do with panicking than Covid but when she called 111 they said she could go to the walk in centre and get checked out.  She was there until the early hours but they did an x-ray on her lungs and blood test, all came back fine so that put her mind at rest.  She still has no sense of taste or smell and it still coughing but that should get better day by day.  Her husband's test came back inconclusive and he has been fine, as are the children.There is another woman who Joanne works with who tested positive the day after she did, so more than likely one passed it to the other, but which one it was is anyone's guess! I'd been in contact with Joanne for a couple of hours the Friday she tested positive, (I hadn't seen her all week, isn't that just sod's law!), so I've been doing a lateral flow test for a week because of going to mums.  I got up with a sore-ish throat on Tuesday and Wednesday my nose was blocked, although my LFT had been negative Stevie suggested I get a PCR test done, again because of going to mums, so on Wednesday afternoon I did and I got a text yesterday to say my test was positive for Covid.  So now I have to isolate for ten days.I feel like I've got a cold, I'm sneezing and my nose is bunged up, I have got a cough, sort of a bark, not all the time though, and today it's better than it was yesterday, and it's not as bad as Joanne's cough.I haven't had a temperature nor have I had a headache, I have felt lethargic today, just like you would if you had a cold, in fact, if it hadn't been for me having to go to mums most days I wouldn't have done a test and I've have just said I'd got a cold.   I haven't been going anywhere except for food shopping, I haven't been meeting up with friends or going anywhere that's crowded, I even gave our first stitching meet up a miss a couple of weeks ago because I didn't want to be in close contact with people I hadn't seen in almost two years and have refused to go for a meal with some friends recently too because I just wouldn't feel comfortable, and I still wear a mask and sanitise when out, so the only place I could have got it is from Joanne visiting for those couple of hours last Friday.  She feels really bad about it and keeps saying sorry but she had been testing for work and was showing negative all week, so how was she to know?    I am thankful though that the symptoms I'm having are mild.We decided that It's best if Mark stays in Glasgow this weekend as it would be difficult to keep separate in home and It wouldn't  be good if he took it back and past it around the job!I've got plenty of paracetamol, tissues and tea to keep me going and of course I've got crafty things to keep me occupied, I just need to find something good to watch on TV and I'll be sorted.I hope you all have a good weekend, and if you are out and about stay safe, it's still out there!-X-"},
{"title": "It's never too early to start", "date": "Wednesday 6 October 2021", "text": "Christmas goodies have been arriving in the shops for a good few weeks now but this past week I have seen a lot more added.I think it's a British thing, but we do like our tubs of chocolates come Christmas.  I've bought three, Celebrations, Roses and Quality Street, I do put them out for anyone who comes to help themselves so like to have a good supply.  I buy Oliver and Arty a tub of Haribo to share as they prefer sweets over chocolate.When the girls were small they used to open the 'Christmas biscuits' on Christmas morning to have while they were opening their presents, I still buy a box of biscuits out of tradition more than anything else really.The box of Lindor and  Dairy Milk will be to put with two of my Son-in-Law's presents, I have to get one more of something similar for Darren but needed to check with Stevie first to make sure what he liked.I popped into Home Bargains and treated myself to a wax melt advent calendar, I do love all the Christmas smells and will enjoy opening this each day leading up to Christmas.As far as presents go, I give Jenny and Joanne money to get the children's main presents, they know more what they are into than me and it ensures that they all have the same amount, they will then give me what they have bought to wrap up,  I do make up a small sack for all the children as well with little extras, which I have been buying and stashing away for a while. I don't buy for extended family and me and Mark don't usually buy for each other, so that only leaves the girls and their other halves to sort out.I've no idea what's happening about Christmas day yet, except that Jenny, James and the boys want to have dinner in their own home, I don't think Stevie and Darren will want to eat alone and I know Joanne would prefer everyone to be together, neither me or Mark are fussed either way, as long as we can see the children open their presents on the day I'm happy for them to do what they want to do.I hate a last minute rush for things so like to get things when I see them, how about you, have you started buying?  or is it too early?-X-"},
{"title": "The almost done's", "date": "Sunday 3 October 2021", "text": "As we are fast approaching Christmas and the end of the year I want to try and get as many of those 'Almost Done' things crossed off my list.  My Dandelion cardigan is now cast off and all that remains to be knit are the button bands.  I knit the sleeves flat so I have those to sew up as well, but the end is in sight.  I've tried it on and i'm pleased to say that it fits!  Can't wait to start wearing it.I've been knitting on this cardigan for Jacob on and off for a good few weeks, as it's only garter stitch it's easy to knit on when I only have time to do a few rounds.Both fronts and sleeves are finished and I'm about half way done on the back, so again, not much left on this on.  I'll probably knit on this Wednesday and Thursday when I'm at Jenny's.Once I'd finished making my Quaker Drum last week I pulled out my Autumn Dream hoping to get it finished in the week.  Unfortunately there was more left to stitch than I thought there was and It's not done, but it's not far off.  It would be nice to get this one finished so it has a few weeks on show in the right season.I do have some other things that are 'Almost Done' but these are the ones i'm focusing on at the moment, once they are finished I will choose others to work on.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On Friday Stevie and Darren went to London to see a show, they were only staying overnight but she didn't want their cat, Ralph, to be on his own all night, he'd never been left overnight so she asked if I would have a sleep over at theirs to mind him, so of course, that's what I did.Isn't he a handsome boy?He plays catch like a dog, he spent ages with this piece of silver foil, I threw it, he ran and fetched it and bought it back to me to throw again.  My cats are old ladies now and you forget just how playful kittens are.~~~~~~~~~~~~~Also on Friday Joanne, my middle daughter, called to say she had done a lateral flow test at home and it was positive.Joanne, Gavin and the children all went for a PCR test that night and only Joanne's came back positive the next day, so she is currently confined to her bedroom.  She said she feels rough but better today than she did yesterday and in the night, she has spoken to a doctor by calling 111 and he has reassured her and told her that if she feels she wants to she can go to the walk in centre and someone will see her.   Hopefully the worst has passed now and she will start to feel better, I think she said they are all having to isolate until October 12th, I'm not sure what the rules are now but the children can't go to school or nursery anyway because of Gavin isolating too.Autumn has well and truly arrived here, we even had the heating on for a while last night, not that I mind, I quite like the cooler weather.   The rain keeps coming though, It's certainly making up for the dry September we had!-X-"},

There are various places along the way where you can pull in to enjoy the scenery, I took my time and stopped often to walk along a section and enjoy the views.  The road splits off at one point, turn left and it will take you to the summit, carry straight on and it will take you to the West shore of Llandudno, (I posted about the West Shore a few days ago).  I drove to the summit first although I didn't spend too long there this time and then I drove back down to the intersection where you carry on down to the West Shore.People do live on the Orme, I wonder if they realise how lucky they are or if you have this view everyday do you start not to notice?There is also a hotel, no wonder there are no vacancies, what a view!Saint Tudno's church dates back to the  6th century and is well worth stopping to see and walk around the grounds.  (I did take a video walking around the grounds but can't seem to upload it from google photos)The next two photos are taken from the summit And then it was back down and the drive to the West shoreIt was such a lovely way to end my few days away and I'm glad I took the time to do it.  Of course, the place is so much better than my photos could ever do it justice and you have to be there to appreciate the peace and tranquility. So now I've taken the tram and driven the Orme, next time I visit I would like to walk it, there were quite a few people walking and I think you could take your time, enjoy the views and it would be fantastic.Another long photo heavy post so If you made it to the end, thank you for indulging me :-)-X-"},

{"title": "Found a few crafty shops ", "date": "Friday 17 September 2021", "text": "Before I came away I did a search on line to see if there were any craft shops in Llandudno and I got three results, The Wool Shop Llandudno, Ewe Felty Thing and Crafty-Ty Wools, all were in walking distance.  Ewe Felty Thing was the nearest, a lovely shop selling various hand dyed yarns plus other commercial yarn that I had only seen other people show on podcasts, I spent a while in there and I did buy something but it might be a present so I won't show it yet.  I didn't think to take any photos inside but the woman was lovely and friendly.  There are no shops where I live that sell hand dyed yarn so this was a real treat.Crafty-TY Wool shop is such a lovely shop, so bright, airy and modern, but cute too, It was a mother and daughter here and again they were both lovely, friendly and very helpful.I recently decorated our smallest bedroom and have been thinking that I would like to crochet a blanket for the single bed in there, It will be a Winter project but seeing as they had all the Stylecraft colours in stock I decided to get them while I could.  Not very good photo, the light in this room is very poor.I couldn't resist buying a couple of fluffy pompoms, they were only £2.50, they will be good for any hats I knit for Bonnie this winter.My last purchase from there will be a Christmas present for my daughter, Joanne.  The yarn is called ReTwisted Chainy Cotton and came with a free pattern for a crochet Rustic Market Bag.  They had a sample bag made up and it's a decent size, I know she has looked a making one of these so I hope she likes the yarn colour I chose. The other wool shop sold loads of other crafty items as well as lots of commercial yarn.  I managed to find some buttons that I think will go well on my cardigan.I came back to the hotel around lunchtime and did a couple of hours stitching, I might have had a cheeky nap too ;-)  I went for a walk late afternoon to the other side of the bay, I'll leave you with some of those photos.-X-"},

{"title": "Cardigan knitting", "date": "Tuesday 14 September 2021", "text": "I started the Lady Mademoiselle Dandelion Cardigan by Along Avec Anna towards the end on June last year.  I knitted both sleeves and had also knitted the body almost up to the underarms and then put it away and it didn't see the light of day until a week ago. The sleeves are knit first and then the body is knit in one piece bottom up to the underarms and then the sleeves are attached to the body to knit the raglan decreases.  I'd never knitted anything this way before and I think I got a bit scared about attaching the sleeves, so it just sat in a bag for over twelve months.I don't know what I was scared of, it was quite straightforward once I started.  There are a LOT of stitches on the needles now so the rows take a while to knit but at least I'm making progress and the end is in sight.The photo below shows the colour better than the one above.The yarn is Drops Nord, colour 07 - it's a sort of toffee colour.The pattern, which is only on the front and back. is the Dandelion Flower Stitch, which at first looks and sounds complicated but it's only done over two rows and is really easy to knit and memorise.  I can't wait to get this done now, just hope it fits!On Thursday I'm going on a little trip for a few days, I'm going alone so will probably write a couple of blog posts while I'm away, I'm planning on lots of stitching and knitting time and just generally having some slow days.Take care-X-"},
{"title": "The last week of the school holidays - (lots of photos, sorry, not sorry 😃", "date": "Tuesday 7 September 2021", "text": "Most of the schools around here went back on Monday but last week Oliver stayed over with me for a few nights and we had a couple of days out.Joanne had last week off work so we took Oliver and Bonnie to Worcester for the day, they have an elephant trail around the town at the moment as part of a public art trail.  There are thirty large elephant and thirty six small elephant sculptures dotted in various places around the town, all individually designed.  They will be there for eight weeks, after that they will be auctioned off and the proceeds will go to St Richards Hospice.Bonnie had been asking to go for 'afternoon cakes' for a while, so we found a cafe that did us a high tea.Me and Joanne shared thisAnd the kids got finger sandwiches, a drink, crisps, a small chocolate and a choice of cakeWe also visited the Cathedral.  My youngest daughter, Stevie-Leigh, went to Worcester University and her graduation was in Worcester Cathedral, but apart from that one time when she graduated we have never been to look around inside.Worcester Cathedral is also the final resting place of Prince Arthur, eldest brother of Henry VIII And King John, of Magna Carta.On the day we visited it was also the last day for the The Leaves  of The Trees Memorial.  I'd never heard of this travelling memorial but this is what the information board said about it:\"The Leaves of the Trees\" installation will be visiting towns and cities around the country.  It has been designed to honour those who have passed away during the coronavirus pandemic and to allow us all to take a moment out to contemplate what we have been through both collectively and individually.The installation is made up of , leave with the word HOPE on each, creating a beautiful impression of autumn leaves fallen from the trees and naturally scattered by the wind.The leaves symbolise not only this period in time but also hope for the future, as the shape of a sycamore maple leaf traditionally symbolises, strength, protection, eternity and clarity.Steel has been chosen as the material for the leaves to remind us of our resilience and collective strength.As it moves around the country the steel will age, rust and change colour, just as the leaves of trees do when they fall each year.It is hoped that the simplicity and beauty of the installation will give people the chance to pause and contemplate their own personal response to the pandemic.Have you heard about this memorial? or seen it displayed in your town?I did wonder if someone has to pick up all 5,000 leaves and place them all individually back down again 😕On Wednesday me and Oliver had a trip to The Black Country Living Museum.  This is only a few miles from us and my kids used to love it there when they were little, seeing how things were done in the 'olden days' lol.  I haven't been for a good few years, they had added a few more things since the last time I visited.This is the main 'street'.  All the building are original, they were taken down from their where they once stood in towns around the Black Country and re-built here.They have games in the street, who remembers playing in the street when they were little?We always played in our street, now there are just to many cars and other dangers for children to enjoy this amount of freedomThe low building on the right is the school where you can experience a lesson of the time.The taller building in the middle is the fish and chip shop, it's always popular.Inside some of the shopsI remember my granny had a big wireless in the kitchen.They have added a transport section since the last time I visited, some interesting vehicles on display, including this little carBut I think Oliver liked the tram and the bus bestI used to go to school on a bus just like this, but it was the No. 130 to Halesowen 😀We took a ride on the bus when we were ready to go home, those seats did make me laugh, funny how you can forget about something then as soon as you see it everything comes back to you!They are in the process of adding a new era, there will soon be a new hub all about the 50's and 60's in the Black Country, I'll be interested in visiting that when it opens.And yes, in case you wondered, my blog is called Blackcountry Wench because I'm Black Country born and bred 😄-X-"},

{"title": "Monday's outing", "date": "Thursday 26 August 2021", "text": "Monday's outing this week was to somewhere I haven't been before, Charlecote Park near to Wellesbourne and about four miles outside Stratford-upon-Avon.  It was about 45 minutes in the car but pretty straightforward to get to.Charlecote Park was built in 1558 by Sir Thomas Lucy, the Lucy family had owned the land since 1247 and Queen Elizabeth once stayed in the room which now the drawing room.Only the lower floors were open to the public and we couldn't spend too much time reading or looking at all the lovely things because we had three children in tow.  So I think a child free trip might be in order so that I can appreciate it and find out more.The servants quarters were interesting, Arty took a liking to the stove of all thingsAnd they were all fascinated to see how washing used to be done.  What hard work it must have been, I wonder what they would think if they came back now and saw our washing machines and tumble dryers.The grounds are huge, 185 acres, and there were lots people taking advantage of the good weather that day.  It mentioned on the NT site that deer roam freely around the estate, we found a bunch of them on one side of the estate and a bunch on the other side of the lake.Jacob sheep have been kept at Charlecote Park for over 200 years.  They were introduced by George Lucy from his travels through Europe back in 1756 and were the first managed Jacob flock to be introduced into England.  Today they have one of the largest flocks in the countryIt was a great day out and I can highly recommend a visit, especially if the weather is good because the walks around the estate are so lovely, there are plenty of things to see and lovely big open spaces for the kids to run around.  There was even a bit of den building, Arty's not afraid of getting his hands dirty that's for sure, lol-X-"},
{"title": "Still stiching", "date": "Sunday 22 August 2021", "text": "I started Quaker Pumpkins by Hello From Liz Matthews at the beginning of July and worked on it on and off for a couple of weeks in that month, then I'm afraid I lost interest in it.  I'm not one of those people that can just put a few stitches in here and there, I much prefer to set aside a chunk of time to sit and stitch, that does mean that I'm less productive though, especially now with looking after grandchildren, who are still on school holiday and taking my turn looking after mum.But last week, apart from one day, I had a child free week and a week off from my turn at mums, (we have all taken it in turns to have a week off 'mum duties' so that we could get a decent break).  It was lovely not to be clock watching every day and thinking about being somewhere by a certain time, and of course It meant I had some free time for stitching.It was never my intention to stitch the words on this piece, so with a bit of luck, and some stitching time I'm hoping to get it done soon.  And.... I've just noticed that there is an incomplete section on the first pumpkin! Good job I uploaded the photo because I hadn't noticed it 😕I have an idea how I'd like to finish it but, I don't know if my finishing skills are up to it, we shall see.I opened my surprise book this morning as I will need something new to read tonight. There were a couple of guesses as to what the book might be and some people, like me, hadn't got a clue.  There was one person however who guessed correctly.  Gloriade said she thought it was Whitethorn Woods by Maeve Binchy, and she was right!I've only read one other Maeve Binchy book and that was a long time ago.  This one has mixed reviews on Goodreads, but I'm going to give it a go and I'll let you know what I thought later in the month.I haven't done any baking in a while but I was in the mood to this morning so we have scones and banana loaf for tea.  I only use a basic banana loaf recipe and then add some extras, chopped nuts, sultanas, chocolate chips, and my secret ingredient, (caramel flavouring), shhh, don't tell😉 That little drop of flavouring is what makes the loaf so delicious and everyone who has tried it has said how lovely it is, so it must work, ha ha.I hope you are all having a lovely relaxing Sunday, we have another Monday outing planned for tomorrow which I will tell you all about later in the week.Take care-X-"},
{"title": "Monday's outing", "date": "Monday 16 August 2021", "text": "Our Monday outing today was to Wightwick Manor, (pronounced Wittick), a Victorian manor house who's owners were passionate about the Art's and Crafts movement.  Today the house is owned by the National Trust for everyone to enjoy.  The house was built by Theodore Mandor who's family were successful 19th century industrialists.  It was built in two phases, the first being completed in 1887, the house was then extended in 1983 by the addition of the Great Parlor wing.  Theodore and his wife decorated the house with designs from William Morris and the Arts and Craft movement, which was popular at the time.Theodore's son, Geoffrey Mandor persuaded the National Trust to take on the house even though it was only 50 yeas old, the collection were so complete that it was considered worth preserving.  Descendants of the Mander family still retain a private apartment at the Manor.Only the ground floor of the house is accessible at the moment, not sure why, but there are beautiful grounds to walk around and enjoy too.In the kitchen garden we found some very big pumpkins and a scarecrow! There are more photos on a post from August 2016 of Wightwick Manor HERE.  It was a better day weather wise than today and more photos of the inside of the house, there is also a very little Oliver, lol.On the way out we took a look around the shop, National Trust shops are a little on the expensive side, but it's nice to look, we came across a basket full of wrapped books, I can't resist a surprise book and at £3.00 each was worth a chance.There is a tag with a little clue as the what the book is about, the one I chose said...  Full of warmth, humor and compassion.  This story tells of the people of a sleepy Irish town, each with their own tale as they wait for the great road of progress.....I thought this was such a brilliant idea.Does anyone have an idea as to what the book might be from the writing on the tag?  I haven't got a clue, but would love to read your guesses :-)I'm not going to open it until I've finished my current book, then I'll let you know what was inside.-X-"},

{"title": "July in books ", "date": "Thursday 5 August 2021", "text": "I've been enjoying some good books this year and discovered some new to me authors, so I thought I would mention a few of them here in case they appeal to any of you.  I like to get book recommendations, sometimes you discover something you might have otherwise passed by, and it's always good to find new authors. I do love a good crime story and when this one popped up on audible I thought I'd give it a go, so glad I did.Sweet Little Lies is the first book in the Detective Cat Kinsella series, followed by  Stone Cold Heart and finally Shed No Tears. I listened to all three via Audible and they were all narrated by Jane Collingwood.  I love that the same person narrated all three books, and Jane did an excellent job.  I loved Caz Frear's writing style, she keeps you engaged all the way through with twists and turns that keep you guessing all the way to the end.  I would highly recommend these to anyone who enjoys a good Police procedural and I recommend reading them in order, although each book is a stand alone case Detective Cat Kinsella has a back story that you learn more about in the first book and the other books will then make more sense.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I must have really wanted to read this next book because I bought it twice, one new copy and one from a charity shop! (not the first time I've done that).Away with the Penguins is in the same genre as The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry and The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessey.I loved this book and by the end of it loved Veronica McCreedy too.Veronica McCreedy lives in a mansion by the sea.  She loves a nice cup of Darjeeling tea whilst watching a good wildlife documentary.  And she's never seen without her ruby-red lipstick.  Although these days Veronica is rarely seen by anyone because, at 85, her days are spent mostly at home, alone.  She can be found eithere collecting litter from the beach ('people who litter the countryside should be shot'), trying to locate her glasses ('someone must have moved them') or shouting instructions to her assistant, Eileen ('Eileen, door!').  Veronica doesn't have family or friends nearby.  Not that she knows about, anyway, and she has no idea where she's going to leave her considerable wealth when she dies.  But today, today Veronica is going to make a decision that will change all of this.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Apparently  Peter May wrote Lockdown over fifteen years ago, in 2005, but it was rejected by publishers as being to unrealistic.  Fast forward to 2020, the Covid 19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns and the book was finally published.The story is not about the flu epidemic as such but a whodunit with the pandemic as a backdrop.  We would have thought it was all a bit far fetched pre 2020 but he has got so many things spot on, including it being manmade, it's uncanny.If anyone would like to read either Lockdown or Away With The Penguins please mention it in the comments, if more than one person expresses an interest I will do a draw.  Due to postage costs I can unfortunately only post to UK.-X-"},

Since mum has been out of hospital it's become apparent that she needs more help.  She has gone downhill these last few weeks and doesn't seem to want to be bothered with anything, where a few months ago she would make a cuppa and warm a meal up in the microwave, now she won't do even that.  There are four of us, I have two sisters, one younger and one older and an older brother, and we are all doing our bit to help but sometimes, as the saying goes, 'too many cooks spoil the broth'  Between myself and my youngest sister we have come up with a rota for next week, fingers crossed it will work without too much fuss, we'll see.  Mum does have a carer to go for an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening to put her to bed, so things should  run ok if we can work together on doing the rest.I haven't picked up any stitching or knitting in a couple of weeks, when I have managed to sit down I've just not been in the mood, it will still all be there when I have the time or inclination again.On Monday I took Bonnie to nearby splash park, we only stayed for an hour or so because it's been unusually hot here this week.  We bought some bubbles on the way home and she had just as much fun with those in the garden.  While we were sitting there she was excited to see all birds coming to the feeders too, and I was happy to see the Long Tail Tits back again, I haven't seen them in a while.Oliver had a sleepover on Wednesday night and we spent Thursday afternoon playing games and watching tv and I've had Arty for a few hours today while Jenny and Oliver went shopping, he played lovely in the garden watering all my plants for me.And yes, I did put some hair grips in his hair!  I wish Jenny would take him to get it cut but she say's he makes such a fuss when she takes him that she is waiting until James can take him.I think in future I'll try to see if I can fit in more regular shorter posts, perhaps that would work better for me.I hope you have all been making the most of the hot weather here in the UK, (for me that has meant staying indoors for the most part), it's all supposed to change from tomorrow for a while though, the cooler weather will be most welcome.-X-"},
{"title": "Rain with a chance of sun", "date": "Wednesday 7 July 2021", "text": "Mark had to go up to York on Saturday to do a couple of little jobs at the Bowling place that was finished last year just as the first lockdown came into force, he asked if I wanted to go along too and have a day in York while he did what he had to do and, as I haven't been very far in ages I jumped at the chance for a change of scenery.The weather here on Friday was glorious, but I had other things planned for that day so we decided to travel up on the Saturday morning and stay over night.  Of course the weather changed over night, it's a good three hours drive up to York from here and we ended up driving up there with rain most of the way.The rain did clear by the time we arrived and as the Park and Ride is right outside where Mark had to be and only a five minute ride, I jumped on the bus into town.A short walk away from where I got off the bus is York's most famous street, Shambles.  I've not been to York in a good many years and I wanted to walk up these cobbled streets again.I'd like to say it was how I remembered, but it wasn't.  The lovely quaint street has now been mostly taken over by Harry Potter themed shops.  I love Harry Potter, I've read all the books, several times but, I think it's taken away some of the history and feel of the street.  There is a rumour that Diagon Ally was based on Shambles, (hence the shops, I suppose), however JK Rowlng dismissed this on Twitter saying that she had never been to or seen Shambles, so there goes that myth.I did walk around a little for a couple of hours but the rain set in so I headed back on the bus to meet Mark.  Our hotel was half way between York and Scarborough, and the plan had been to visit Scarborough on the Saturday afternoon but as the weather was pretty awful by that time we just went to the hotel.Sunday morning we woke to blue sky's so, after breakfast we drove the few miles into Scarborough.I hadn't seen the sea in almost two years and the last time we visited Scarborough was around 2012.Scarborough has two bay's, the North Bay and the South Bay, both with lovely sandy beaches.  We only had enough time to walk around one so we parked up on the South Bay side.  We had a lovely walk along the beach and the harbour, there were quite a few people about but it didn't feel crowded. Scarborough was the UK's first seaside resort and The Grand Hotel dominates the South Bay.  At the time of its completion in 1867 it was the largest hotel in Europe and one of the biggest is the world.  The geek in me always likes to look up some information on where we are going and I regaled my findings about The Grand to Mark as we were walking along the beach. It took around ten years to build at a cost of £100,000, (around £11.5M in today's money), has 4 towers to represent the four seasons, 12 floors to represent the months in a year, 52 chimneys to represent weeks in a year and 365 rooms, representing the number of days in a year.  The hotel is also built in an unusual V-shaped style to honor Queen Victoria who was the Monarch at that time.In WWII it was used as a base for the RAF and anti aircraft guns were mounted on the four towers.Over the years there have been many famous guests too including, The Beatles, King Edward VIII and  Winston Churchill, there is also a Blue Plaque on the hotel which marks where Anne Bronte died in a house on the site where the hotel stands.It is a lovely grand old building and you can just imagine what it would have been like in day's gone by. Sadly now it is in need of some TLC.  It is still used as a hotel but does not have very good reviews and is certainly not the grand place it once was, it could be re-named the Seagull Hotel as there are birds on every ledge and in every crevice.  I bet the noise is horrendous in the rooms, I took a little video, hope it works.We missed any rain in Scarborough but there was enough rain for Noah to launch the Ark on the way home!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~We arrived home on Sunday tea time to a phone call from my sister to tell me mum had had a fall on Saturday night/ Sunday morning.  She hadn't hurt herself as she sort of slid down as apposed to going a wollop.  She has however been a bit more confused and falls asleep all the time we've noticed this last week or so, more than usual so I said I would feel better calling the doctor on Monday.  Well I'm glad I did because she had a really low heart rate, (41) and has ended up in hospital.  She's doing ok, I will know more of what is going to happen once the doctor has seen her again tomorrow, I can call after lunch time for an update.It was a long day on Monday, I spent most of it at mums waiting for the paramedics to come, they arrived at 10pm and by the time mum was settled at hospital it was 2am before I got into bed.I had another visit to hospital last night with Stevie, she suffers with anxiety/stress and had palpitations and an increased heart rate so took herself off to A&E about 6pm.  I went down and stayed with her, they scared her a bit because they said they needed to 'get this sorted' and her to have a blood tests.Long story short, she is fine, her ecg and bloods all came back normal.  Stevie is a worrier like me and is prone to panic attacks, she has tried all the usual things and I've suggested some things for her to try but I know it's scary when you have these episodes and often there is no rhyme or reason to them.It was almost 4am when we got back, so two nights of very little sleep have wiped me out but, at least she was checked over thoroughly and even though It was a long time to sit in A&E we are so lucky that here in the UK we have a free health service that we can call upon, sitting there so many hours yesterday gave us both an insight to the comings and goings and how hard these people work, and they go about it with such a calm attitude.  It's a job and an environment that I don't think I would be able to work in, but I am so thankful for the people that can, and do.-X-"},

{"title": "My favourite waste of time", "date": "Tuesday 22 June 2021", "text": "One of the things I like best about our house is the kitchen window.  I can see all of our back garden from this window, it was one of the things I loved when we came to view the house and I still love to pull up the blind each morning to look out there.We have both enjoyed watching our many feathered friends visit this year, perhaps they always visited but I was at work and didn't get to enjoy them, but since I've been at home, watching the birds come to the garden each day has become one of my favourite things to do.  I could spend hours just watching the comings and goings We have all the various tits visit the feeder, but the blue tits have been the more regular this Spring and Summer, mum and dad bought their babies to feed, that was so lovely to watch.We have two robins that come at the moment, this is the skinny one, very cheeky, he is the one that comes down close when we are cutting the grass or weeding, I always say hello to him, I bet the neighbours think i'm mad!And one a bit plumper, he's a bit more shy.We also have some of the bigger birds visit.  Mr Magpie loves it when I put cheese on the feeder and will keep coming back until it's all gone!The crows love the mealworms, but are also partial to cheese too.We also have a Jackdaw that comes who is also fond of mealworms, it doesn't take long for the bigger birds to clear the table, basically they keep coming back until it's all gone, lolMy blackbird is usually the first one to visit, if he come down and there is no food for him he stands and looks towards the kitchen window as if to say, come on it's feeding time, so funnyI wasn't sure what this one was so asked on fb and was told it was a Dunnock, we have probably had these before but I've mistaken it for a sparrow, which I've noticed we don't have very many of.The woodpecker comes a couple of times a week, once he's fed he sits up in the tree for a whileI've been trying to encourage the Goldfinches for ages, but although I hear them only one year have we been lucky enough for them to come to the feeders.  I put all the right sort of food out but they don't seem to want to come.  This is the closest we had this year. (Can you spot him in the middle?).  They came on and off all that day, so there must have been something they liked there.But the ones we were excited to see this year, (they have never visited before) were the Nuthatches.For a few day's I kept seeing a different bird but it was so quick I couldn't get a picture, then one Sunday we noticed half a dozen or so of them in our oak tree, mainly on the trunk of the tree but they would fly back and forth to the feeder.  I finally managed to get a photo and we used good old google to find out what it was.They came for a good three or four weeks, although I think they have now moved on. Although I used to feed the birds when I worked I never got to enjoy them really, so there are some advantages to being at home :-)-X-"},
{"title": "Only mad dogs and English men", "date": "Wednesday 16 June 2021", "text": "We've been spoilt with all the sunshine these last few weeks and, it was certainly welcome after all the rain and cold of the previous couple of months.  But, because we are in the UK we have to make the most of it because as we know, it can drastically change overnight.  According to Alexa tonight we have a flood warning, I suppose there is a storm coming our way pretty soon so it will be all change.Monday's outing was to Baggeridge Country Park.  For some reason I have never been here before, don't know why because it is only a 20minute drive away.  We spent almost all day there, the weather was perfect, not too hot for walking and not too sunny for Bonnie, (because she is just a hot sweaty mess in the heat and being a red head cannot be out in the sun without being plastered from head to toe in factor 50)We had a great time and plan on going back again over the summer.We walked right to the top to see the amazing view and this little bean didn't complain once, it was quite a hike too.There is a great children's playground there too with a sand pit, Bonnie would have been quite happy sitting in that sand all day.To make the most of the weather when I collected Oliver from school today we went a ride down to Bewdley and had an ice cream, a nice river walk and a fish and chip tea sitting by the river.I hope you have been making the most of the weather too.-X-"},
{"title": "The English countryside", "date": "Saturday 5 June 2021", "text": "The weather has changed for the better this last week and it tempted me to do a couple of outings.  On Wednesday I took a drive to Shrewsbury.  Shrewsbury is a Tudor town with some lovely buildings, a great range of shops and a lovely indoor market too.  I did look in a couple of shops as the town itself wasn't too busy but my intention was to grab some lunch and visit the park.The Quarry Park is 29 acres and has been a place of recreation in Shrewsbury since the 16th century and is still well used today.  This is just a small section but In the distance you have the town, and behind me is the river Severn, to the left is a large children's playground and a splash pool, which was full of children enjoying this sunny day.At the heart of the park is The Dingle which was cultivated by the famous Percy Thrower who was also Superintendent of the park for 28 years.  It is the most peaceful place and although at the moment there is a one way system in place was not it the least busy.  There is a section that is still closed off and the benches have been removed due to Covid but the space is still amazing.My other trip out today was to Bourton-on-the-Water, probably one of the best known and more popular Cotswold villages.  As Saturday was another scorcher it was busy, but again I didn't go to look in shops.The river Windrush  runs through the middle of the village and it has a number of tiny bridges, the water is really shallow and so people congregate on the grass banks and use the river to paddle in.As you can see, it was very very busy so I didn't hang around where the crowds were.There are houses running right along the river bank, very pretty houses, but I'm not sure I would like crowds of people right outside my garden taking photos of my house all the time.  (ok, I'm one of those people 😅)I walked further back from the main village which was much quieter.  All the houses are built from the same Cotswold stone, it really is such a pretty place and I think when you imagine an English village this is what you think of.Every house seems to have a beautiful cottage garden and I just loved this one with all the alliumsAnd then as if all those house's weren't pretty enough, walk another hundred yards or so and you have all this wonderful countryside!I did another blog post about Bourton-on-the-Water in October 2011, when we had a heatwave.

{"title": "A tale of two stitches", "date": "Monday 31 May 2021", "text": "I've been wanting to have a go at sewing something wearable for a while and I got a load of fabric off Mark's auntie a few months back, mainly for finishing cross stitch items but, there were some larger cuts of fabric in there too. I chose this pattern by Tilly and the Buttons because it said it was a beginners pattern, it takes you though all the steps from cutting to assembling and sewing.  I also liked the idea of a tunic as I do wear them a lot.Tadah!I did it!I set aside last Tuesday when I knew I would have no distractions, and good job I did because it took me most of the day :-)Now I'm not saying it's perfect, but for a first attempt I'm pretty happy with it and....it fits.  If I wanted to be really picky about the fit,  It could do with taking in a smidge, but I could still do that If I decide I want to.  I've also been stitching on and off.I haven't been feeling like stitching lately but I did get Autumn Dream out recently to see if it would spur me on.This is where I'd got to when It got put away.And this is how it looks now it's had some attention.I'm going to keep plugging away at this though June in the hope I can get it finished, although If I'm honest I don't much like stitching on it, I do however love the design so it needs to be finished.Today is another Bank Holiday here in the UK and for once the weather is beautiful, not that we are going anywhere, I would imagine there are crowds of people out and about today because of the sunshine, so I'd rather stay at home.  We've worked in the garden all morning before it got too warm and enjoyed a quiet afternoon.Mark is back at work tomorrow and as it's half term I won't have to pick Oliver up from school so I have the rest of the week to myself :-)-X-"},

{"title": "Eenie meenie miny mo", "date": "Sunday 9 May 2021", "text": "Since lockdown ended and more shops opened up I didn't feel the need to go shopping for the sake of it and have still only been going to the supermarket for food shopping.  But, last Thursday I had Oliver because the schools were off for voting and as I was going food shopping anyway I suggested we have a mooch around the charity shops in the town.  Oliver loves looking at the books on offer, he is an avid reader and is in the advanced readers at school, he comes out everyday with a book tucked under his arm and when I pick him up we have conversations about what book he is reading and what he is going to read next on the walk back home.   I'm glad he is interested in books, so many boys don't like reading so I'm happy he has inherited both his mums and my love of books.Usually I find it's slim pickings on the books but I was very lucky in the first shop we went in and bought three for 99pI found The Other Passenger for £1 and got the other three for 99p in another shop.Oliver was a bit put out because all he managed to find was a Minecraft book but I came away quite chuffed with my bargains.I hadn't bought any books for a while but the week before these popped up on Amazon so I treated myself.  So together with my charity shop haul I think I'm sorted for reading material for a while.I've just finished reading Major Pettigrew's Last Stand, (another charity shop find a while ago), and really enjoyed it, If you have read The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry I think you would enjoy this book. Isn't it lovely having a nice pile of books to choose from?-X-"},

You can see he has already found the comfy blanket on the bed, lolThere has been a few problems since he arrived.  The people they bought him off were not entirely honest about his health. When Stevie went the vets to register him and get him checked over it was discovered that he had an infection in his nose and was swabbed for ear mites, (the swab did confirm ear mites the next day).Stevie did say that the woman they bought him from took him into another room to wash him before they went away.  I thought that was strange and the vet, without Stevie saying anything said that his ears had been cleaned with something.    Stevie messaged the breeder to tell her what the vet had said but she denied that there was anything the matter when he left her and was quite rude.  Once it was confirmed he definitely had ear mites Stevie messaged the woman again, because if  Ralph had ear mites then so must her other cats and kittens because apparently it is very contagious and so thought she should know.   At first she ignored her message but then said she would refund her £150 (of the £200 they paid for him).   He's settling in lovely now and making himself at home as you can see :-) I didn't do much in the way of stitching or knitting during April but I did do a lot of sewing.  I have thought for quite a while that I would like to open an etsy shop and so this weekend I took the plunge and did just that.  I'm very nervous about putting myself out there and not at all good at self promotion so I don't know how things will go, but if I don't try I won't know will I?   At the moment there are some project bags and a few fabric baskets/pouch's but hopefully I will be adding more things in the next couple of weeks.  If you would like to pop over and have a look what I've been making you can find me by searching Mayfairstitches on etsy.  I hope you have a lovely week and enjoy this Bank Holiday whatever you are doing.See you soon-X-"},

I've been back to my normal self yesterday and today, although the injection site is quite sore to touch and a little bit red.It's been another beautiful day here, I haven't been anywhere today, I've had a play date with my new sewing machine, Tuesday is the only full day I get to do what I want to do without interruptions. The clocks went forward on Saturday so now we have lighter nights, I have to confess that I'm not a fan of lighter nights, I much prefer it to get dark earlier, then I know it's time to stop, there is a tendency to keep going if it's light and before you know it it's bed time 😂I hope you have been enjoying the sunshine anyway, I think the rest of the week is predicted to be much of the same.-X-"},

Anything that makes me smile at the moment is welcome.I've decided she is a girl bunny, too cute to be a boy!I put a few things on my mantle but I do have other bits around, I'll show more next time. Well, It was twelve months ago today that the UK went into lockdown and the office I worked at closed like all offices around the country.  We thought it would only be for a few weeks and yet here we still are. You will probably know if you have been a visitor here for a while that it was during the first lockdown that I was made redundant.  The way it was gone about was not very nice and people where not who I thought they were.  I'm only in contact with the other woman who worked on reception with me, we text or message each other occasionally if we have something to say, other than that I am not in contact with anyone who I worked with, and that's how I want it.I don't mind admitting that I was gutted when I lost my job, I've cried, quite a lot, over the last year, I would never have thought being made redundant would have such an effect on a person, it's only a job after all, there are worse things in the world.  But it has affected me in ways I didn't expect, not only did I loose my job I also lost my routine and a purpose to my days, it affected my moods, my confidence and took away my feeling of independence.  We are lucky, my wage was never depended on, it was extra but it was there if needed and it was something I had earned so, yes it did take away my independence.  I've been struggling a lot these last couple of weeks, I know it's a phase and it will pass but at the same time I know that I'm not the same person I was twelve months ago.  Hopefully along with the Spring flowers a better mood will take over.I see coffee shops in town getting ready for re-opening on April 12th although the rest of the high street looks apocalyptic, so many places have shut their doors for good, lets hope in time it can recover.Sorry to end with a moan, but i'm just feeling moany at the moment.Take care-X-"},

I love it! If you have never watched This is Us you really must go and find it out, I'm watching on Amazon, not sure if you can get it on Netflix?Until next time-X-"},

Someone decided it would be a good idea to walk in a particularly wet, sticky muddy puddle and got his wellie stuck!  Off came his boot and he landed in the mud, luckily he didn't fall in, but his one foot was submerged in mud so his sock had to come off before putting his boot back on, always fun and games with kids isn't it.Once through the mud and at the top the view is fantastic, it was very very windy up there though. I didn't take any photos of the monument this time, it was far too windy to hold the camera steady.  Iv'e shared photos of Wychbury Hill and the Monument before though, last June, they are on this blog post if you want to read about it.  We decided to keep going forward rather than re-trace our steps so we headed for that mound you can see in the middle distance.Looking back, there's the monument in the distance, we are about halfway to the mound nowWe saw some crows (at least I think they were), they seem to have found something to take away, wonder what it is?We're at the top on the mound now and I recently found out that there is an Iron age hill fort within those trees beyond, something to explore another time.Oliver needed a sit down and wasn't in the least bit interested in the fantastic viewsIt looked like we might be caught out by the rain on the way back, but luckily it held off.Now we have to head down to those trees and into the field beyond to make our way back out onto the road and homeWe are so lucky to have this lovely green space and quite a few public footpaths on our doorstep, I  know we really should make more time to enjoy them.And in case you are feeling down because of all the restrictions still going on, I'll leave you with the reminder that was posted at the bottom of the hill.See you soon-X-"},

{"title": "Remember Elizabeth Jackson?", "date": "Sunday 14 February 2021", "text": "Nine years ago this month, probably almost to the day, I started stitching on Elisabeth Jackson.(Two photos from my blog post in February & March 2012)The photo above shows how much stitching I'd done and was the last time I worked on her, March 2012.Fast forward a good few years and I joined a group on fb where people posted their unfinished projects and asked if anyone would either finish it for them and send it back or alternatively you can put you unfinished project up for adoption.I still had some affection for Elizabeth and didn't feel I wanted to put her up for adoption, so, I asked if anyone would be willing to finish her for me.  Lo and behold a lovely lady called Nadia said she would do it for me.  We didn't know each other so it was a bit of a leap of faith for me to pack Elizabeth up and send her to someone else to stitch on, but pack her up I did.That was back around the end of July last year.  Nadia messaged me a couple of times letting me know how she was getting on but the last time I heard from her was around October/November and then with Christmas and New year to be honest I forgot about poor Elizabeth until Nadia messaged me to say she's done!I received her back in the post last Wednesday, do you want to see?Elizabeth Jackson 1824 by Samplers RevisitedNadia did an absolutely brilliant job, she's a stitching angel!  The back is as neat as the front, you would never know that two different people had stitched on this, I'm so happy 😁The lighting in the photos is not brilliant its making the fabric look slightly different in all of them, I would say the last photo is more true to colour now.   To tell you the truth, I didn't really like the colour of the fabric, never did, it had a yellow tinge, and that was probably one of the reasons she got put to one side.  So, when she arrived back I gave her a bath in tea and coffee, and put her in the oven to dry 😨But it's ok, don't panic, she came out fine.  I'm still not totally in love with the fabric colour but it's toned down the yellow-ness and given her an aged look.  I like it. As soon as lockdown is over i'll take her to be framed.I now only have one very long term WIP left, I won't be asking anyone to finish that one though as I know once I force myself to pick it up I will like working on it.What's the longest WIP you have hidden away?-X-"},
{"title": "Wednesday walk and book talk", "date": "Wednesday 10 February 2021", "text": "It was far too cold to take Bonnie out for a walk on Monday, It kept trying to snow all day but never settled, the wind made it feel even colder.  We had planned on going to a local National Trust property, most have lovely grounds to walk in, although at the moment none of the houses or cafe's are open.   There was a smattering of snow yesterday morning and still very cold but the wind had dropped and the sun came out for a while.  I only went on a local walk, to the church at the bottom of road, back up and around the outskirts of the estate.  I like walking when the weather is like this, cold and crisp with a bit of Winter sunshine, in fact, I prefer walking in this kind of weather than in the Summer.  I always think when it's cold, you can wrap up against it and get warm and cosy, whereas when it's hot there is no way to get away from it.  That's my logic anyway :-)I finished my latest audio book while walking, The Four Winds by Kristin HannahI almost changed my mind about choosing this one but I'm so glad I didn't, it was an excellent listen, the narration was by Julia Whelon and she did a brilliant job of bringing the story to life, I could picture everything so well.  Here's the blurb, (copied from Amazon)Texas, 1934. Elsa Martinelli had finally found the life she’d yearned for. A family, a home and a livelihood on a farm on the Great Plains. But when drought threatens all she and her community hold dear, Elsa’s world is shattered to the winds.Fearful of the future, when Elsa wakes to find her husband has fled, she is forced to make the most agonizing decision of her life. Fight for the land she loves or take her beloved children, Loreda and Ant, west to California in search of a better life. Will it be the land of milk and honey? Or will their experience challenge every ounce of strength they possess?From the overriding love of a mother for her child, the value of female friendship and the ability to love again – against all odds, Elsa’s incredible journey is a story of survival, hope and what we do for the ones we love.My knowledge of American history is near to none existent and I had certainly never heard of The Dust Bowl, I had to go in search of more information.  The sign of a good book for me is when it makes you want to find out more, and this did, I love that. I gave this book 5 stars, and I don't do that very often.My bedtime reading was another one from Matt Haig, The Humans.If you have read anything from Matt Haig you will know that his books are all different, he must have the most vivid imagination and insight to come up with his subjects.(The blurb from Amazon)After an 'incident' one wet Friday night where he is found walking naked through the streets of Cambridge, Professor Andrew Martin is not feeling quite himself. Food sickens him. Clothes confound him. Even his loving wife and teenage son are repulsive to him. He feels lost amongst an alien species and hates everyone on the planet. Everyone, that is, except Newton, and he's a dog.Who is he really? And what could make someone change their mind about the human race . . . ?This one might not be everyone's' cup of tea but I really enjoyed it, there was a lot of truth about humans in those pages.I keep a list of everything I'm reading and listening to on Goodreads, there is a link in the sidebar.See you soon, stay safe and warm-X-"},

But with the origin of his earlier isolation always lurking in the shadows will he ever get to live the life he's pretended to have for so long?This is my 5th book of the year.  I gave it 3 stars but only because of some of the dodgy accents the narrator used, I loved all the characters, especially Hubert.While I was stitching and listening Mark worked on our jigsaw.  Well I say our jigsaw, but I've only worked on it once with him, I did the robins.He did quite a lot on the bottom right after I took this photo, it will probably take a good while more as there is lots of white!The next two days I'll be picking Oliver up from school, we have different sorts of chats on the way home which usually include Minecraft or Pokemon, lol.   Other than that it will be more of the same for the rest of the week.I hope you are all having a good week and filling some of your time with something you love doing.See you soon-X-"},

I find have to take more time to make my stitches neat, but I'm happy with how they look so far.  I won't be fully finishing them until they are all stitched as I want to do them the same.I haven't made any resolutions for the year except not to start too many things, I would like to finish what I start in a reasonable time and I would like to go into next year with nothing carried over, if I can.  I have three cross stitch WIP's, (not including the ones shown here today), one of them is about seven years old, and I would like to get those finished this year.  I also have the Dandelion cardigan that I started back in the summer, (this one could be finished quite quickly if I put my mind to it) and a pair of socks that are about half done.  I think that's enough to keep me going for a while :-)As well as not blogging I've not been visiting, reading or commenting on many blogs either this month.  Hopefully I will put that to rights this week.I hope you all have a lovely week and enjoy the snow, if you have any.  Don't wish the Season's away, time goes by too quickly as it is and Spring will come soon enough :-)Take care-X-"},

I've looked at this kit for so long.  Sharon at my local needlework shop stitched it a few years ago and has it hanging in the shop and every time I go in I admire it.   I probably won't start it just yet but it will definitely be one to stitch in 2021Included in the advent swap that I did with my lovely friend Jo were some things for me to open on my birthday.  Thank you so much Jo, I absolutely love everything 😀There is one more family birthday today, my brother's.  He is seven years older than me so you could say that I was his birthday present all those years ago, lol.  We were very close when we were younger, I used to follow him everywhere and he would let me tag along with him and his friends.  We don't see each other very often now but he is still the one I can relate to more than either of my sisters.When I was younger I used to think it was a bit pants having a birthday so close to Christmas, I tended to get presents that were for Christmas and birthday.  Having two of my daughters born in December I made sure that never happened with them, they always had, (and still have) a proper birthday with birthday presents wrapped in birthday paper, (very important to someone with a birthday close to Christmas).  I don't mind that my birthday is so close to Christmas now, when I was at work it meant that I never had to work on my birthday either, ha ha.I've been stitching away on my Waxing |Moon Designs January sampler over the last couple of daysDo you think I made this happen 😄I know a lot of people hate it, but It just makes me so happy to see snow 😁☃☃☃I hope you are still enjoying what's left of the festive season, now made even more festive here by the snow :-)See you soon-X-"},

The Ribena one is not much different to normal Ribena to be honest, where as the Vimpto has more of a subtle mulled wine taste with a definite hit of cinnamon.  I'll definitely get some more before that one disappears off the shelves.Two more lovely advent's left to open, hasn't it gone quickly?After all the running around today I'm planning on a quieter day at home tomorrow.Take care, see you tomorrow-X-"},

{"title": "12th December - The canal that wasn't", "date": "Saturday 12 December 2020", "text": "When we went for our walk at Leasowes Park last Monday I noticed the canal just off the car park.  There are a series of canals all around the Black Country and Birmingham most are hidden from the busy traffic and unless you go looking you wouldn't know they are there.  This morning I decided to go again and explore the canal.  From what I can find out this is known as the Lapal Canal and is part of the Dudley No. 2 canal which once went to Selly Oak in Birmingham and was opened in 1798.It turned out to be the canal that wasn't.  I've been reading a bit about it and apparently there is a Lapal Canal Trust who are raising money to do restoration work, the council cleared this small first section but the rest a few years ago but the rest remains overgrown.Behind me was the Basin, (Hawne Basin), which is all overgrownThe further on you go the more overgrown it gets, but you can still clearly see where the canal was.The pathway eventually comes out onto a duel carriage way which must have been built over the canal from what I've read the canal does start up again over the other side of the road way.  There is another interesting walk over that side which I would like to do some other time.The pathway I followed today was Monarch's Way.  We have seen these signs often, there are two on the next street where we live, and we have often wondered what they were for but it wasn't until I was reading more about Leasowes Park that I found the answer.Monarch's way is a 615 mile pathway that starts in Worcester and ends in Shoreham-by-sea and is an approximation of the escape route taken by King Charles II in 1651 when he was defeated in the Battle of Worcester.  History, literally on my doorstep :-) Love it!I took a little detour off the canal path on the way back to walk round Breeches Pool on the edge of The Leasowes I'm so glad I re-discovered this area again and I'm sure I'll be back there again very soon.Can you believe we are half way through advent already?  The day's are flying by but nowhere feels very festive despite the decorations in the shops and around town.  I do love opening my little packages each morning though :-)These are today's gorgeous yarns, I had to smile when I opened the one from Jo, she had included a fox face mask :-)  Thank you Jo, I shall enjoy a relax in the bath with this on :-)See you tomorrow-X-"},

At least I know these will all be gone in another couple of weeks :-)I've only dressed the mantles in each room so far, we have no Christmas tree to put up at the moment, yes, I got rid of that too, I'm being ruthless, lol.We bought the two lanterns above for by the fireplace a few weeks ago, I've got lights and Santa in the larger one and I found out one of those battery candles for the smaller one.  I was confused last weekend, when I went to bed on Saturday I said to Mark don't forget to turn off the candle and lights before you come up.  On Sunday morning when I opened the blinds the candle was off, when I went in the room again on Sunday evening the candle was on.  I asked |Mark if he had put it on, he said, no, and it wasn't on for me to switch off when I came to bed last night either.  Strange.  The same thing happened on Monday.  I mentioned to Joanne that we had a magic candle and it was a mystery, she said no mum, they turn themselves off, they are on a timer, whatever time you first put them on that's the time they will come on each day and they only stop on for a certain time!!! doh.  Neither me nor Mark had even thought of this, lol, we MUST be getting old😂😂Here are today's lovely advent goodiesSee you tomorrow-X-"},

{"title": "3rd December - Ornaments for the boys", "date": "Thursday 3 December 2020", "text": "You may have seen two of these ornaments when I was stitching them in Jolly July but I don't think I have shared them fully finished.Oliver requested a reindeer for this years ornament.  I had bought a magazine chart off ebay a while ago, it was quite vintage looking, a round finish in a hoop with Santa in the middle and all the reindeers around him.  I chose to stitch Rudolf on his own and finished as an oval.Isn't he cute?  I think this is one of my most favourite stitched finishes and Oliver loved him when he opened him this afternoon.   I may have to stitch another reindeer this year too :-)I chose a snowman for Arty.  This is Frosty Flakes by Little House Needleworks.I think he came out really cute tooArty has two ornaments this year because being a bad nanny, I didn't finish his for last year.I think this is a Lizzie Kate one, although I can't find the chart now so i'm not certain.This was all stitched up last year but I didn't like the trim so this year I took the trim off and replaced it, I think it looks much better now.I've fallen behind with finishing and still have Bonnie's and Jacob's to make up, hopefully I can do that at the weekend.There are some lovely goodies in todays advents.  I opened a Mr & Mrs Rabbit Yarns one today which included a lovely lavender sachet and an angel charm, along with the one from Jo and Lisa.  Jo also included a little container of bulb stitch markers.  I do love the bulb ones, thanks Jo.  The tea light is from my candle advent and is a Winter spice, very nice.There was also a little recipe included in with the lavender sachet and angel.  It sounds lovely.I might give this a go nearer to Christmas.It's been so wet and dull and dreary all day today, I really don't mind the Winter months but I prefer a cold crisp day over rain.  We have more of the same predicted for tomorrow as well.See you tomorrow-X-"},
{"title": "2nd December - All girls together", "date": "Wednesday 2 December 2020", "text": "My December Calendar girl is all finished.I started stitching these in December last year and continued to stitch one a month all the way through 2020, I'm both surprised and pleased that I managed to keep it up all through the year.And here they are altogether And all the backs.  I have only used the same fabric once.  The finishing is not perfect but it was great practice making them all up each month.  I must learn to write down what I do for future reference, for example, I could never remember how many strands of floss I used when making the cording, If I had written it down it wouldn't have been a issue, as it is, some of them have thicker cording than others, but that's not really a problem as they are displayed on their own each month.These charts are by Little House Needleworks and were released as a monthly series back in 2014.  I was lucky enough to buy all twelve charts at a special price on one of our stitching meet-ups at Nimble Thimble a couple of years ago.  As far as I'm aware they are still in print.I did wonder how I was going to store all these once they were stitched but after searching for weeks I finally found a box in a local card shop which is just the right size to keep them all in.  It lives on the top of my bookcase in easy reach so that I will be able to just pull one out at the beginning of each new month from now on.They all just fit in lovelyI had visions of covering this box with fabric and perhaps lining it to pretty it up.  But I think that is probably beyond my crafting capabilities, it doesn't look too bad as it is and I don't want to ruin it.These are todays advent yarns.  The gold one and a tea treat from Jo, the skein is from Crafthouse Magic and the little ball is from Lisa. I forgot yesterday, I did also treat myself to a tealight calendar.  It was only a cheap one from Home Bargains but so far the two I've opened have been very nice, the tealight above was todays.Do you like my Santa biscuit jar?  Joanne bought him for me from a car boot sale in the summer.  I got him out and washed him last night, he hadn't been used at all, he still had the sellotape holding the lid on, (which is the black mark you can see on the photo), and the padding inside the lid. Biscuits, when we have them, don't usually last long enough in this house to be put in a jar, and they certainly won't last any longer in here, but I do love his jolly face.We have a birthday today, my middle daughter, Joanne is 33. December is a month of birthdays in our family so you will see a few more pop up during blogmas :-)Of course you have to have a cake made by mum on your birthday, I took this sprinkle one round when she got back from work today.We came out of lockdown today, the pubs, restaurants and places of entertainment are still closed as we are in tier 3, (our area went into lockdown in tier 1 and came out in tier 3, work that one out!).  All shops are open again now and of course that means there was a rush to the local shopping mall, (according to social media, I haven't, nor will I be going myself).  It was to be expected I suppose with Christmas being around the corner.I hope you have all had a lovely day, see you tomorrow.-X-"},
{"title": "1st December - All the advents ", "date": "Tuesday 1 December 2020", "text": "Happy 1st of December.  I hope you are having, or have had, a lovely day. I'm re-using my lovely traditional advent calendar from last year, no chocolates behind these doors, just a pretty picture.I've treated myself to two yarn advent calendars again this year, a Liberty inspired one from Claire at Mr & Mrs Rabbit yarns and a Mistletoe Kisses one from Ellie at Crafthouse Magic   I had the twelve day calendars from both and will alternate opening them so that they last the 24 days.I've put both of these into one box to make it easier, the Crafthouse Magic ones are in the silver bagsI've also done a swap with my lovely friend Jo (jothroughthekeyhole).  We agreed to swap 24 6g minis from our stash and a 100g skein for Christmas day.Jo's arrived in this huge box, isn't it lovely?Inside everything is wrapped beautifully.  The blue ones are to be opened on Christmas day and Jo also very kindly included a few things to open on my Birthday which is the day after Boxing Day, so kind.I also took part in a swap on IG organized by Kelly of Layfamily Yarn.  The brief was to include 24 minis, a chocolate treat and a handmade gift, my partner's name is Lisa, who as far as I know does not have a blog.Yarn advents can be quite expensive to buy so early on in the year I had started to buy some a mini skeins here and there to put together my own.  My plan was to add to it when I went to a couple of yarn shows in the Spring.  Well that didn't happen, obviously, but I did manage to get enough to make up another twelve day package and bagged them up with my eyes closed, lol, which is quite difficult to do!I've decided now to save these until after Christmas, perhaps give them to myself as a little birthday treat and start opening from January 1st.So, at last, here are my goodies for today.  Two little packages from Mr & Mrs Rabbit, some lovely handmade soap, a square of Liberty fabric and a Liberty inspired yarn.  From Jo I opened a Hedgerow yarn mini and a little chocolate, which you will notice is missing because of course it's quite acceptable to have chocolate for breakfast during advent  :-)The other little mini is my swap from Lisa.Mark got Christmas from the loft on Sunday and I have promised to sort it all out this week and only keep what we will use as he says he is getting too old to keep getting up the loft!  I have already started on that and got rid of a few things, including giving one of our trees to Oliver and Arty, they share a small tree which they decorate themselves which was getting a bit crowded, now they have a six foot one which should be better for all their ornaments.For the first time in many years we don't have our tree up on December 1st.  I did want to get a new tree this year and we've been out looking and I just can't find one that I like that doesn't cost a small fortune.  I might just have to settle for our old one for another year or get a real one, I haven't decided yet.   I usually like to get everything decorated in one day but I'm afraid it will be happening bit by bit over the week this year.Other goings on this week - It's been all go here since the weekend, my youngest daughter, Stevie and her fiancé Darren got the keys to their new house on Friday.  They should have been in at the beginning of July but because of you know what, building was delayed.  Anyway, they are in now and slowly unpacking all their belongings which have been in storage for the last five months or so.  There are a couple of issues they have had to get in touch with the builders about, like the fact that they have a space for the washing machine but no plumbing for it!  So guess who is doing the washing until it's sorted, yep, good old mum to the rescue again.Jenny's partner, James has finally arrived back home today.  I think I've mentioned before that James is in the RAF and has been in Afghanistan for the last five months.  He should have been back in October but things are apt to change and his date kept getting put back.  It's been a long five months for Jenny and the boys, it's hard enough with kids but I think Jenny has found it especially hard going this time, the boys can be a handful at the best of times but with clubs not operating for them and limited places open for outings and the summer holidays too, it's not been easy.  Well, that's it for the first day of advent, lots going on, not a lot of crafting though :-)See you tomorrow for the next installment -X-"},

{"title": "Some knitting and a trip out!", "date": "Thursday 29 October 2020", "text": "I finished another In Threes cardigan for Bonnie this week.  These are great cardigans for layering and for that bit of extra warmth now it's turned cooler.This one is knitted in Stylecraft aran yarn, it's really nice and soft and knit up lovely.I knitted another Spindrift shawl by Helen Stewart back in September but forgot about it until I was rooting about in the wardrobe the other day.I've no idea what yarn I used except that it was probably one of the first hand dyed yarns I ever bought, so it's a couple of years old at least.Mark has been at home for just over a week until another job starts.  All this shutting places because of Covid has affected his work.  They mainly do new and re-furbs on Hollywood bowls but because of the pandemic all the work that was planned has now been put on hold indefinitely.  Bowling ally's were some of the last entertainment places to open back up so they have made little to no money this year.Anyway, while hubby has been off he has been busy fixing up the conservatory, (I'll tell you more another time), so on Tuesday I got out of his way and took myself off to Worcester for the afternoon.  Stevie went to Worcester Uni and we used to go there quite a lot when she was living there, but not so much recently.It's a really nice city with some lovely old buildings and because I rarely go anywhere now my afternoon outing really lifted my spirits.The Eagle Vault pub dates back to around 1740 and is a Grade II listed building, love the tiles.The Guildhall is another lovely old building, built in 1723 it is a Grade I listed building, being right in the middle of town you can't miss itThe Tudor House Museum dates back to the 16th century, this and the Eagle Vaults pub are on the same historic street, Friar StreetAnother interesting thing about Worcester, Arthur Tudor, Prince of Wales and brother to Henry VIII is buried in Worcester Cathedral.  I have only been inside the Cathedral once (When Stevie graduated) and always forget to go an have a proper look round, perhaps next time I'll remember.I actually went to Worcester not for the history but for some fabric for finishes.  There were at least three good quilt shops in the town at one time, alas I think Covid has put paid to that because they are no longer there :-(So no finishing fabric but these are some of my spoils from the day.Three Christmas bags and one stocking for Jacob, Bonnie Oliver and Arty have stockings that belonged to the girls when they were little which Santa now fills and leaves at Nanny and Grandads house ;-)I usually buy the children a Christmas ornament from one of the various Christmas markets we go to, sadly there will be none of that this year.   Oliver and Arty chose one each a couple of weeks ago so I got one for Jacob and Bonnie this time.  The little reindeer is from Tiger, and is for me :-)I also got a couple more presents for the little ones and a present for my sister's birthday in November, so a good day In all.In other goings on, I was finally able to have the steroid injection in my knee yesterday, that should give me a good five to six months of pain relief and i'll be able to walk and get up from sitting without ceasing up :-)  My elbow has been much better this last week, I resorted to taking Ibuprofen again as the week before it was quite painful.  Obviously I can't take these long term so fingers crossed with the exercises it will start to get better.  I have another hospital appointment next week for a scan on my wrist.  I have a small lump there which the doctor thinks is a ganglion.  Honestly, I feel like i'm falling apart since I've not been working, lol.I hope you are all staying safe and well with all the new restrictions and tiers coming into place.  Our borough was in tier 1 but according to the news tonight we will be moving into tier 2 by the end of the week.  Looks like we will be distancing, mask wearing and sanitizing for a long time to come.Take care, see you soon-X-"},

{"title": "Cup Cake hats", "date": "Wednesday 9 September 2020", "text": "On my day trip to Anker Wood last week I mentioned that there was also a Dobbies Garden Centre on the same site.  I do like Dobbies, they always seem to have something different and the food in the cafe is really good too.  This Dobbies was extremly good, in addition to the usual things you find at garden centres there was also a large butchers, a Ponden Mill (soft furnishings), Peacocks (clothes) and a shoe section, all under the same roof. We had a good look round and my eagle eye spotted some Caron Cupcake yarn on sale.At £2.99 I had to pick up a couple to try.The yarn cake comes with a pompom and on the reverse of the label is either a knit or crochet hat pattern.  I chose the ones with a knit pattern and this is how they came out.I was pleasantly surprised by the yarn, it was really nice to work with and I think they came out great.  These will be put to one side and appear in Jacob and Bonnie's Christmas stockingThere is enough yarn left from each cake to make another hat, (so you could make two hats, if that makes sense, lol)I don't want to add these to my stash so If anyone would like the remaining yarn please leave me a comment saying so and I will mail them out to you, including the ball band with the pattern, (of course you don't have to use the pattern on the ball band, it is only just a basic hat pattern).  You will however have to make your own pompom should you want one as the yarn only comes with one per cake. Because of postage costs I'm only offering to post within the UK and they will go to the first person to say they want them in the comments. Take care-X-"},

{"title": "Just One Dammed Thing After Another", "date": "Wednesday 2 September 2020", "text": "Jenny hadn't realised that September 1st was a teacher training day and hadn't booked the day off work, so Oliver had another sleep over on Monday night and we had a day out yesterday.I found Anker Wood after searching 'things to do near me'.  On the same site is a Dobbies Garden Centre, so, something for both of us :-)Unlike last weeks outing there were not many people around at all and we had a lovely few hours exploring the mazes, (there are three), the parkland, looking at the animals and adding some wood to the camps already there, Oliver wanted to build a camp of his own, afraid not mate, were only here for a few hours 😂 He would have quite happily have spent all his time lugging bits of wood around, must be a boy thing.This morning It's back to school and the start of year three, it's going to be a bit strange for everyone after almost six months at homeI've been feeling a bit under the weather lately, not quite myself, and a bit down in the dumps if i'm honest.  I got a cold a few weeks ago, I think I caught it off Arty as he had a snotty nose one of the times I took him out, mostly I had the sore throat and dry cough, so you can imagine how it sounded to anyone if I went out!  Just a side note....if you have a cold don't have a menthol sweet and wear a face mask at the same time, your eyes water like billio, as I found out lol.Just as the cold began to clear up I began to get a lot of pain around my elbow and down into my forearm, It was even painful to lift a cup.  After lots of googling, (because I couldn't get a phone appointment with a doctor for a few days), I found I had all the symptoms for Tennis Elbow.  When I did eventually speak to a doctor she agreed with my internet search!! and recommended taking paracetamol and Ibuprofen for a week, and no knitting, crochet or stitching, or anything that might put strain on my arm.  Well as it's my right arm and I'm right handed that rules out just about everything!I bought an elbow brace thingy off Amazon and, fingers crossed, not on my right hand cuz it still hurts a little to do that, it's slowly getting better.With all my internet searching I did read that Tennis Elbow will usually disappear of it's own accord in most cases in six to twelve months.  So I've gone back to my crafting, wearing the elbow brace when I do anything and taking regular breaks as it does still hurt if I have my arm bent for any length of time.On Monday I enlisted Marks help in the garden, me doing the lighter jobs and shouting instructions to him on what to cut back and I got stung by a wasp, sigh.  Yep, probably payback for all the pointing and shouting at hubby.Of course, I can't just get stung, I have to get infected too!It gradually got bigger and bigger and I ended up calling the doctor again yesterday for antibiotics, which in itself was an ordeal because first I had to get past the receptionist!He called me back within five minutes and asked me to send him a photo on the link he was going to text me.  At the time I was on my way back home from dropping Oliver off and the surgery was closing in ten minutes. Now this sting is on the inside of my left knee and I have trousers on, you can guess what coming next.  All I can say is, I hope no one saw me wriggling my trousers down in the car while parked at the side of the road!Bonnie has also been in hospital over-night because of a high temperature, that, thank goodness turned out to be because of what they believe was an ear infection and the start of a cold. And my daughter, Joanne, who follows me for infected bites was bitten by goodness know what while at the park and is also on antibiotics.So yeah, Just One Dammed Thing After Another!-X-"},
{"title": "Wookey Hole and Wells", "date": "Thursday 27 August 2020", "text": "Oliver is staying with us this week and on Monday we had a day out to Wookey Hole.  It was my second choice for a day out to be honest, I would have much rather visited Cheddar Gorge but the caves there are still closed to visitors at the moment. It's about a two and a half hour drive so we set off just after 8.30am and the weather was sunny for the whole drive.  As soon as we passed through the ticket office it started to rain, we just managed a quick dash to shelter before the heavens openedA bit of rain never dampens the British spirit though :-)The rain lasted a good 45 minutes so when it eased we joined the queue for the caves even though our ticket time was 2pm.   The Wookey Hole website asks you to book a time for the caves, but it looked as though there was no particular system to letting people in, In fact I don't think they had limited the number of visitors to the sight at all judging by the number of people around.  It was virtually impossible to social distance, although mask wearing was mandatory inside the cave.They have cage aged cheese (and wine)It is obviously better, with more to see than my photos show.On the same site and with access only after you have through the cave is  Animatronic Dinosaur Valley which was actually quite good, you might remember me saying when Oliver was a toddler he absolutely loved dinosaurs, he can still name them all and tell you random facts about them :-)I don't know if this is a smiley face a grimace or terror because there is a T Rex behind, lolYou can see it starting to rain again, just after we came out the cave!We had a walk around the vintage penny arcade and parted with a couple of £'s and had a chuckle at our funny reflections in the hall or mirrorsSome of the attractions were closed, because of the virus I assume, although it did say the handmade paper mill was open but when we got there that was closed too so apart from the Pirate Island golf, which to be honest by late afternoon was just water-logged and the ice cream parlor there was nothing else left for us to do, but it was almost time to check into the hotel by then anyway.Overall I was disappointed really, obviously the weather didn't help but as far as I can see on the website, they are still charging the same price even though an awful lot of stuff is closed and more to the point, they do not seem to be limiting numbers as is suggested.  I wouldn't be rushing back there anytime soon.The hotel however was very nice, I'd booked us a table for tea at Captain Jack's restaurant, later I saw that the rating was only 2 stars so I wasn't expecting much but it was surprisingly nice, we're not talking posh nosh, and the menu was limited, but it was good.  Our room included breakfast on Tuesday morning, again the food was very nice, no complaints from us.After breakfast we drove into Wells, Oliver had some money to spend and it was burning a hole in his pocket!We did have a walk around Wells Cathedral and Vicars' Close tooVicars' Close is the oldest residential street in the UK, it was built over 850 years ago to house the  Vicars Choral, it's residents today are still the vicars choral, organists and virgers.Love this, It's like stepping back in time. At the top end of the close is the vicars chapel and libraryStorm Francis had arrived by Tuesday, we tried to capture how windy it was, I don't think you can quite see it but trust me it was violent!We had a day pottering about the garden yesterday and today it's raining again so our plans to go for walk have been put off, instead we are having a film day, which means I can get a bit of sneaky knitting done :-)Take care-X-"},

{"title": "Week one of Jolly July", "date": "Wednesday 8 July 2020", "text": "I haven't joined a SAL for quite a while, mainly because I'm not very good at keeping up and I prefer to do my own thing when I feel like it.  But this year I've decided to join in with Jolly July / Christmas in July.  It's not strictly a SAL because the only thing required is for you to stitch something Christmas related.  I don't have a problem with that as it's my favourite season to stitch. So, in no particular order, these are my Jolly July starts for the first week.LHN Frosty FlakesI'm stitching with the recommended colours on a mystery piece of 32 count fabric.32 count is not my favourite, I think the stitches look a little bulky using two stands of floss but I'm taking it slowly and I think it looks ok so far.Next is The Button Tree by The Drawn ThreadAgain I'm using the called for threads on some pale grey 28 count evenweave. I only started this one yesterday and am already almost half way.  I don't have enough pretty buttons to finish it so will have to search Amazon or ebay for those.This is Country Cottage Needleworks Gingerbread House #3Another chart I've had for ages and never stitched before.  I'm stitching this on 28 count fabric in pale blue with the recommended threads.  I really love how this one looks 💗💗And finally, Jacobs Christmas stocking.  This is Brett's stocking by Shepherds Bush I'm still waiting for some of the threads to come for this one, hence the small amount of stitching, hopefully they will be here within the next week.  I could carry on stitching further down the chart but I'm scared of miss-counting and having to rip it out again, I'd sooner wait and get it right.Next week I plan on having another three or four starts and then I'll work on them all in turn until the end of the month, obviously Jacobs stocking is going to take me longer than a few weeks to stitch but as long as I get the stitching done on it by around the end of September that will give me plenty of time to make it up.I got the call from work last Friday afternoon, it was what I had expected from the off.  Redundancy.I won't go into the all the ways that I feel hurt and betrayed by the company I've worked at for the last fifteen years, but lets just say I've shed a few tears because of it and that the Directors are not the people I thought they were.At the moment I don't feel in the right frame of mind to go looking for another job, I've never been in this situation before and I need time to get my head round it and feel better about myself.In the meantime I'm enjoying a slower pace to the days and as you can see, getting lots of stitching time.  I know there are going to be lots of people who loose their jobs before we are through with this pandemic and I do feel for you If you are one of those people too.  I count myself very lucky in that we didn't rely on my money but I know i'm going to miss the routine of work and the office banter.I hope you are all staying safe and wellSee you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Half way", "date": "Friday 3 July 2020", "text": "Wednesday marked the half way point in the year, and what a strange year 2020 has been so far.  Who would have dreamt at the start of the year that half of the worlds population would been asked to stay at home and put on lockdown to save lives.  At times it all seems so unreal, thankfully everyone I know has stayed safe and healthy, I don't personally know anyone who has had Covid19 although you have only to watch the daily updates to know that it is indeed real.We can only hope that the situation continues to improve and that the next six months will be better.Like a lot of others I'm still not venturing out too far, I still only go food shopping when I need to, and try to go when I think It will be less busy,  I do get nervous when there are too many people about and have come across people who seem to have trouble with keeping their distance.  In a shop this week a lady asked if she could squeeze past me, I said no, we are supposed to keep a distance, she gave me a look and said, well I've got a mask on!   That's why I don't wear a mask, or gloves, to me they give a false sense of security.  I've lost count of the times I've seen people with gloves on but still touching their face, (or in one case, pulling them off with their teeth!!) or a mask pulled down on their chin so they can speak!  I have nothing against masks or gloves and would definitely use both if I had to use public transport but I'm more aware without them.Anyway, doom and gloom aside, all this time at home has given me more time to do all the crafty things.  Last week I finished my July Calendar Girl.  I still love these girls, I think so far January and April are my favouriteThese are all my finishes in the first six months of 2020.Loved making these rainbows, and I used up a lot of my little scraps of yarn in the process.Mine is still hanging on the front doorI've enjoyed all my stitching this year, but I especially enjoyed stitching that cute snowman  I didn't think I'd done much knitting until I went though my photos.  Can you have too many dishcloths do you think 😉I'm joining in with Jolly July this year, stitching Christmas charts throughout the month.  I made a very small start on Jacobs stocking yesterday and have chosen ornaments to stitch for the grand-kids.  Apologies to those who don't like to speak about Christmas until December but most of my posts in July will be Christmas related 🎅🎄🎅 Still no news on the job situation.  I was called into another meeting on Monday, a very short meeting in which I was told I would get a call within 48 hours with the outcome.   I thought that was it, I came home and was really upset for the rest of the day.  But there was no call until today and that was to say that there is a board meeting tomorrow and the final decision will be made then.  I know they usually have the board meetings in the mornings, so hopefully around lunch time they will let me know, I hate being in limbo.See you soon, take care-X-"},

Yes our daughters and grandchildren come to see us, however, they only ever stand / sit in the garden, never the house. Neither me, or Mark, are in isolation because of any medical conditions, therefore if we keep to the 2 metre rule, them being in the garden is the same as standing on the drive and us standing on the doorstep.  We have a large enough space on the patio that we were able to have our afternoon tea without breaking this 2 metre rule.Be assured that any photos I share of my girls or grandchildren whilst this crisis is going on are taken from a distance and cropped, we are all abiding by the guidelines.I just wanted to make that clear.I hope you are all staying safe and wellSee you soon-X-"},

I planted these last year and wasn't sure they would come again.  They have grown so much in the last weekI have little pots of seeds lining the conservatory window, some salad, and some which will hopefully bring lots of summer colour in the garden.  I'll show you the progress of those in another post.We are very lucky to have such a good outdoor space to enjoy, especially now.  When i'm out there pottering, I can forget for a while what is going on, It calms me, keeps me sane and gives me hope.Keep safe and well all-X-"},

{"title": "In Threes again", "date": "Sunday 22 March 2020", "text": "I took a few minutes this afternoon to sew the buttons on another In Threes cardigan I made for Bonnie some weeks ago.   It's a little too big for her at the moment, I knew it would be, but Joanne can put it away for her to wear later in the year.  I used some drops yarn I had in my stash, so no money spent again :-)I used three buttons I bought from Wool@13 last yearI finished stitching my April Calendar Girl on Thursday,  I sorted through my fabric bits for the backing, I don't have many blues, which would have been better, but I think this polka dot one will be ok, what do you think?I'll set aside some time in the week to put it all together, I have to get some threads to make the cording anyway.The weather was lovely yesterday so we had a few hours tidying up the garden, the grass is still really wet and because we have mostly clay soil, the borders are still sodden.  Mark managed to get another layer of leaves up but there are still many that are too wet to suck up.  I did manage to get all my Dahlia's planted up in pots, I bought nine tubers this year, I don't know if I'm going to put them in the ground or in pots yet, the slugs had a feast on them last year and they didn't thrive very well.It's lovely to see a bit more colour outside after all the dull weather we've had, although the Tulips I planted and looked forward to seeing are not doing very well this time, a combination of pesky squirrels and wet weather I think.  There are some along the edge of the path that might come good, we will have to wait and see.Thank you to those who commented on my last post, it seems this panic buying is not limited to the UK alone.  The announcement on Thursday to close all pub's restaurants, cafes and so on from Friday seems to have lead people to panic buy wine and beer now, there was no wine in Aldi on Thursday and the beer isle was almost empty in Tesco too.  I really do find it hard to believe some people.Today I've seen posts on FB showing the crowds of people waiting outside Tesco and Asda, more akin to football crowds, it's crazy.  The closure of places of public gatherings was to protect people and to try and slow the spread, so why do people think that this sort of crowd does not fall into that description?  I'm trying not to dwell on the news so much because I'm thinking about it too much afterwards, Friday I felt particularly down about the whole thing, not helped by the fact that someone has left a very nasty anonymous comment.  I guess they are not brave enough to leave a name, I do wonder at the mentality of those that feel the need to do something like this.  It did bother me for a little while in as much as I couldn't understand why someone would be like that, and then it annoyed me that I couldn't answer back and call them out for what they are 😠If anyone knows how to block anonymous comments please let me know.  For now I've left the comment there, you can read it if you go back to my last posts comments.   If they come back I hope they're shamed, (but I don't expect they will be).Stay safe and take care all-X-"},
{"title": "What it's like at the moment", "date": "Wednesday 18 March 2020", "text": "I know many people are not mentioning Covid 19 on blogs, but I have decided that I am, and If you're not interested in reading this post, that's fine, i'm putting it here mainly for me to record what things are like here for us at the moment.   But if you do want to comment on what things are like where you are then I'm happy to read them.This pandemic is like nothing we have ever seen before, we can't ignore it or what is happening around the world.  The closing of shops, offices, factories and schools will have repercussions for a long time to come, not to mention the effect it will have on our National Health Service, and to be honest what is happening is very very scary.  I'm not normally one for watching the news but I find myself searching out news items and tuning in to hear what the latest Government Cobra meeting is announcing every afternoon, I don't want to get hung up on doom and gloom but I do want to know what's happening.  I have even been drawn into reading a couple of the conspiracy theory's out there, mainly on FB, until I thought, what a load of 💩, why are you even reading this, and click off it.  If you look hard enough I suppose you will find a conspiracy in anything.Today Boris announced the closure of schools and nurseries from Friday 20th, until further notice, they will however still have to provide care for children who's parents are key workers, Police, Health Services or delivery drivers or for children who are vulnerable.I have one daughter who is an Early Years nursery school worker, she does not know yet if she will be required to go into work after Friday, if she doesn't, she won't get paid, her boyfriend works at a car plant, there is talk of shutting that, again he won't get paid if they do.  My eldest daughter is a Police Officer, she will have to continue going into work, as her mother of course i'm worried about that.I don't want to compare how we are doing things differently to other countries, each country deals with things in a way that is best for them, taking advice (we hope) and steps when necessary, and no one knows enough about this virus to know that one way is right and another way is wrong, we have to trust, to a certain extent, that we are being given the best advice and to take responsibility to keep ourselves as safe as we can.This weekend I should have been going to the craft show at the NEC in Birmingham but of course that's now been cancelled, they will be honoring the tickets for the show at the end of June, all being well.  So many places are shutting their doors as this 'thing' escalates, I fear for smaller businesses surviving these tough times, and of course there are people who are being told to stay at home but wont get paid.  We are usually paid when off sick, not everyone is, but of course companies would not survive at all if they had to pay workers and at the same time were making no money, it's going to be tough on everybody, no doubt about it.In the supermarket I have managed to get most of the things we need.   They still have a limit on the number of items people can buy, two packs of nappies or wipes, one pack of toilet roll and four of anything else.  Makes sense to me, if people only buy what they need there will be enough to go round, even so, there were no baked beans, nappies, tinned soup or tinned peas on the shelves on Wednesday and low stocks of other tinned food and biscuits.  I didn't look at the frozen section but fresh food seemed to be ok.  Some supermarkets are opening early just for pensioners to shop but there are queues outside waiting for them to open at 8am.  They are starting to close at 6pm.  From what I saw in Aldi people were still buying trolley loads of food though.Everyone in our office has been given the option to work from home, except us on reception.  I've been a bit peed off about this if i'm honest, not because I would rather sit at home, but because we don't seem to have been considered at all.  An email was circulated saying people could work from home but they were going to keep the office open so that should anyone need to come in, for paperwork or conference calls they could.  As nothing was mentioned about reception we took it that we would be expected to carry on.  What I was not happy about was the fact that nothing was mentioned to us regarding deliveries coming in or the fact that we are the first point of call for anyone and we are the ones out of everyone that come into contact with the most people.I had to send an email out myself to say please use the hand sanitiser as you come into reception and on returning at lunch time.  I've also put a notice on the door saying the same thing.  To be honest we haven't had that many deliveries the last few days but I'm going one step further now and asking them to leave them in the little porch we have rather than letting them in the building.  Again, this advice has not come from management.  We always joke we are the last ones to be thought about, but this just proves it.I've just looked at the statistics for tonight, as of 9pm there were a total of 2,626 cases with 676 confirmed cases.  Our borough is showing at 10 cases.Wherever you are, I hope you are keeping safe and well-X-"},

{"title": "What do you do with yours?", "date": "Thursday 6 February 2020", "text": "I love taking photos and I love looking at photos too, doesn't matter whether they are mine or someone else's.  I used to have a film camera before everything went digital and I would always fill an album with photos from holidays and trips away.  Since I've had a digital camera I don't get many prints done.  I took a couple of short photography courses a few years ago and really enjoyed it, we used to be given a topic and had to get photos printed to take in the next week, I remember the whole discussion of where to get your prints done and how the machines in the high street shops are just configured to print everyone's photos the same, whereas if you take them to a professional printer they will look at your photos and adjust the machine to get you the best print.I tested this out once, getting two identical photos, one printed at a professional printers and one at a high street chain.   The difference was amazing, the colour on the high street shop photo was just awful, and the top of the photo had been cut off too.  The one from the professional place was exactly how it was on my screen.  I would have probably been happy with the shop one if I had not seen how it should have looked.  Just shows.It made me wary of getting prints, so most of my photos are on my laptopThe difference in price is not that much more from a professional printer really and for special occasions I would still send my photos to them rather than a high street chain, but I have as many photos that have been taken with my phone as with my camera so at Christmas I downloaded an app called FreePrints.  Every month you get 45 free 6x4 prints and only pay for postage.  I tried them out in January and was quite happy with the results so I thought I would tell you about it in case it's something you haven't heard of it.I've had this album for about two years intending to get photos printed, it's similar to a Project Life album, a four ring binder basically.  The idea is that it's a scrapbook project without the need to buy all the scrapbooking paraphernalia but I just can't get on with it so at the weekend i'm off to buy a good old fashioned photo album, lolThere is also a FreePrints Photosbooks, app.  With this you get a free 8 x 6, twenty page photobook and again you only pay for postage.  You have the option to add more pages for a small extra charge and you can opt to buy a larger book if you wanted too.I ordered one last Friday, I made it for Oliver of when we took him on holiday to Padstow in 2017 and it arrived in the post yesterday.There are a good selection of covers to choose from(sorry, bad glare on this photos!)There's a choice of layout's and you can choose to have full pageYou could add a photo on the back cover too, I added a photo of Padstow harbourI'm really happy with how it came out :-)  A couple of the photos are a bit too warm but on the whole I'm very pleased, and Oliver has something to remember our holiday.  He was thrilled to bits when I gave it to him yesterday :-)I'll definitely be doing another one in February :-)I added more pages to my book but when I do another one I'll make better use of the layout options to get more photos in.-X-"},
{"title": "Can't get in the swing", "date": "Friday 31 January 2020", "text": "I'm stitching, I'm knitting but I can't seem to get back into the swing of taking photos and blogging about it.This is a little cardigan I knitted for Jacob before he was born, put in a drawer and forgot about until I was having a sort out.  All I had to to was sew on the buttons.I didn't have seven buttons the same but I think it came out ok this way :-) when he wore it the other day to the mother and baby group Joanne said she had loads of compliments  on it :-)I've started to pack some quick knitting into my bag on the day's I pick Oliver up from school.  I had quite a collection of cotton waiting to be made into dishcloths, perfect quick portable, no brain power needed knitting :-)At this rate I will have used up all my dishcloth yarn in no time :-)Other goings on....I told you last time how I had arranged care twice a day for my mum, she was put on an emergency care package for six weeks, here in the UK that first six weeks of care is free, after that there is another assessment to see if you are still in need of that care, if you are, then you are required to contribute towards the cost of care provided, but if they decide that you are managing, then the care is stopped.Mum had her assessment yesterday afternoon and the conclusion was that she was able to look after herself and the care would stop the next day.  Mum is not entirely happy, but we have been telling her that unless she makes use of the care offered it would be taken away.  She will not let them wash or dress her, she was still doing that herself before they came in the morning, (sometimes no one arrived until 10AM and she will not sit around in her nightclothes until that time), but like the assessor said, they encourage independence and if she could dress herself, great, if she couldn't then she would wait until the carer came in.  Some day they were only there 10 minutes each visit and made mum a cup of tea and warmed her lunch up at dinner time.  I can quite understand why they have stopped the care, it would be a very expensive cup of tea!We can of course go down the route of private carers, if we chose that option we could be more certain of the times they would visit, but again, mum would not allow them to wash and dress her so it would be an even more expensive cup of tea!What to do!  I can totally understand that mum does not want a stranger washing and dressing her, on the other hand I also agree that if she is doing these things herself then she is showing that she does not need the care.  That's not to say she doesn't struggle, she does, but even if it takes her half an hour to get dressed, she can do it.We all help with meals and she has two meals a week delivered but I am in the process of getting her to order more meals to be delivered so that she can have something hot at lunchtime too, that way she won't have to bother doing something herself.   It's all very stressful and mum seems to be getting more confused the more things are in place, we have noticed recently that her short term memory is not what is used to be, she has made hard work of her tablets being sorted into a blister pack, honestly, it's such a simple way of doing it and I'm not sure if she genuinely forgets how it works when I've gone or she is not paying attention because she doesn't want to do it that way.  It's worrying because there were three tablets missing from the tea time section on Wednesday and she didn't know where they had gone!  She was adamant that she had not taken them, but who knows.  Sorry to go on about this, I know that there are many of you in a very similar situation and know how hard it is trying to get someone to change the way they do things and work with new ideas so that it helps all concerned, it's taking up a lot of my time and brain space at the moment, I hope things will settle in to a better routine very soon, for all our sanity, lol.See you soon, take care-X-"},
{"title": "Three things", "date": "Tuesday 21 January 2020", "text": "Last year I got a bit bogged down with the stitching and knitting I had on the go, It seemed to take me ages to get anything finished.  This year I didn't want this to happen so I resolved to try and have only two pieces of stitching and one knitting, or crochet on the go at time.It seems to be a trend, especially with stitching, to start lots of things and work on them in rotation, I admire you if you can do that, but if I had multiple projects sitting in bags with just a few stitches in them, it would drive me insane, besides, I haven't got the space to store them all.I hope that by keeping it to three things it will keep me motivated and I will see more finishes.Easter Parade by Blackbird DesignsFebruary Calendar Girl by LHN I stitched on this one on Sunday so i'm now further along than this photo showsMy knitting is the Betwixmas ShawlThe free pattern can be found on Ravelry and was offered up by Black Sheep Wools in December, you may remember that I posted about buying the yarn in December.Obviously I didn't get it finished in the timescale but I did have a few problems and had to rip it back a couple of times before I found my rhythm.  Not much left to do now so perhaps I might get it finished this week.I do have a finish of sorts, I made another project envelope to keep my second stitching piece in.  This one is a little bit taller than the one I made for my Calendar  Girl stitching so it will accommodate the larger clip frame.  As before, the fabric is from stash and something I've had for a while.I had some lovely post this month.Andrea (who's blog is The Craft Room) had offered up a giveaway on her blog of nine Farmhouse Christmas charts by LHN.  I put my name forward and won!  I never win anything, not even on the tombola, lol so I was very happy when my name got drawn from all the entries :-)I'm looking forward to stitching these and will do my best to fit them into this years stitching.Thank you so much Andrea :-)Once I've stitched them all I will be paying the kindness forward and offering them up here on my blog in a giveaway.I think that's me all caught up for now, I've been trying to find time to post for the last two weeks but life keeps getting in the way.  I've been sorting some care out for my mum, she's 91 and doesn't get around very well anymore, she wanted help in the mornings but the emergency care package they put her on was four visits a day, she didn't like all the comings and goings so we have cut it down to twice a day now, mornings and lunch time.  She is still finding it hard to adjusting to having help, it's a case of her needing help but not wanting to give up doing anything, It's hard work. Up till now she has been sorting her own tablets out every day but it's getting to the stage that she can't see what they are unless she holds the packet right in front of her eyes (she has macular degeneration) and has a hard time even opening some of the packaging, now the chemist will supply all her medication in a blister pack that will be set up for morning, afternoon and evening for the week.  The first pack will be delivered tomorrow so after work I will go up and make sure she knows what she's doing.  Something else for her to get used to and she won't like it but it is the safest option I think.There is always something to do and someone to worry about isn't there?  Fingers crossed she will settle into this new routine and get used to the people going to help. Mum does have a lot of help from us besides this care, there are four of us and we all help her in one way or another, my cousin also visits and does a few jobs for her once a week, she is very lucky really compared to a lot of elderly people.  Anyway, I'm sure we will all get back to some routine soon.-X-"},

I didn't have any left over 4 ply yarn. Then I found out that you could buy mini skeins of yarn, so, happy day's,  I started collecting and before I knew it I had a basket full!I have made a very small start on my blanket, there are several patterns you can use but I'm using the Knitted Patchwork Recipe by Martine Ellis, (which is free on Ravelry) and the chevron layout that Ellie of Craft House Magic suggested on her video tutorials, which you can find on you tube.As you can see, there is a long way to go on this one but I have enjoyed choosing the colours I've used so far and It's nice to see how they knit up.Here are a close up of some of the colours, although with the poor afternoon light some of them are not showing up true to colour.So my blanket is where a lot of  my Advent mini skeins will be going and I shall be choosing some to add in over the Christmas holidayHere are the one's I opened today :-)A gorgeous pink theme going on today :-)  I think all of these would fit right in with the colours I've got going on in my blanket at the moment.I opened another lovely body butter from my Body Shop Calendar.I still haven't sorted out something to keep all these goodies in yet!Thank you for all your lovely comments every day, I really do appreciate you taking the time to stop by. Jane, you have left me some lovely comments every day, thank you, blogger is not letting me find your blog when I click on your name though, can you leave me a link back to your space please?I do hope your Monday wasn't a Manic one-X-"},

I have done some of the extra food shopping by buying little extras in with my normal weekly shop, I don't do a big food shop at Christmas anymore, any fresh food I will buy closer to the time.  My planning has paid off and freed up my time, now I am enjoying the lead up to Christmas and really enjoying opening my Advents each day.From the top -Lay Family YarnCraft House Magic, a little lavender filled pouch was included today toofrom Jo, who included a chocolate too, which I ate before I took the photo :-)I found a trifle bowl out to store my growing collection of Advent minis in. They make quite an attractive decoration of their own don't they😃My Body Shop gift was a Rose body wash.Now I need to find something to keep all my little products in too.I hope you all had a lovely restful Sunday too-X-"},

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on it.When the girls were little we all used to sit down on Christmas Eve  with our picnic style tea and watch Miracle on 34th Street, (the one with Richard Attenborough).For me this is THE Christmas film, if you get to the end of this film and don't believe in Santa then there is just no hope for you, lol.There are no children at home to sit and watch with us now, but on Christmas Eve we will still put Miracle on 34th Street on and eat our picnic style tea, it's not the same though without excited children, so if you have children still at home, just make the most of this magical time while you can, they grow up so quickly.Now that the girls have homes of their own they have their own traditions, (which still does include a picnic style tea) but they watch Polar Express as 'their' film.I like to watch a festive film in the lead up to Christmas and my first one was last week, It was on Amazon Video that I watched A Christmas Wish.It was a quite an enjoyable film, if you like a Little House on the Prairie type film I think you would enjoy this.  I haven't got round to watching any more Christmas films yet, hopefully I can at the weekend.A gorgeous mix of minis in today's Advent :-)At the top - Lay Family YarnMiddle - Craft House MagicFront, From JoJo also included a lovely galaxy hot chocolate drink, I do love a hot chocolate, thank you Jo :-)There was also a little extra in Ellie's Advent package today, a cute little snowflake progress keeper :-)My Body Shop gift was a large nail file, just what I needed actually because mine are worn down :-)I'd love to hear any recommendations you might have for Christmas reading or any films you have enjoyed, or your Christmas Eve traditions :-)-X-"},

{"title": "Naked cake, and anyone fancy doing Blogmas?", "date": "Sunday 24 November 2019", "text": "We organised a little afternoon tea baby shower for Joanne at a local cafe, just some family and a couple of Joanne's close friends.  I wanted to make a cake for her, but something simple, so I watched lots of you tube videos about how to decorate a naked cake, I'm a bit heavy handed when it comes to working with icing so I thought this would be perfect for me.I used the cake recipe that I always use and which turns out perfect every time, it's absolutely fool proof, everything goes in the bowl and is mixed with the hand mixer, you just add flavouring if you want to, I made a lemon flavoured one this time.  The icing is mascarpone which I would definitely use again, it's so creamy and not at all sweet and sickly like buttercream icing.  I used full fat mascarpone, double cream and icing sugar, whisked all together until it was thick and creamy, perfect!It does not set in the same way that buttercream icing sets, but it does hold it's shape perfectly well and personally I thought it was much better to work with when icing the cake.The afternoon tea was at a local place called Mad Hatters, which is all decked out with an Alice in Wonderland themeStevie had a Gentleman's afternoon tea, we were all drooling over it when they bought it out, wishing that we had gone for that option too!We did enjoy our tea though, sandwiches and cake were all lovely and freshly made. When I got up this morning I wasn't sure I would be able to make it, I've been in such pain with my back for the last two days, this morning was even worse than yesterday.  I can only think that I've pulled something, I did clean the windows this week, so perhaps I've over stretched.  I had trouble getting in and out of Stevie's car so have already called to let someone know I won't be in work tomorrow, I just don't think I would be able to drive.  Hopefully it won't be as bad in the morning.  Can you believe that It will be advent next Sunday?  I've got my advent calendars all ready and waiting, I'm so excited to open them!  This is the first time I've treated myself to advent calendars, I loved seeing everyone open their yarn advents last year so have treated myself to three :-)If you are a podcast watcher like me you will know that quite a lot of them do Vlogmas starting on December 1st, I do love to watch the little daily Christmas vlogs and thought wouldn't it be nice if I  could do the same here and have Blogmas :-)So If you would like to join me in a little daily blogging during advent please let me know and perhaps we could all link up and share a little bit of what we do in those days leading up to Christmas, we might even discover new blogs to read and follow :-)See you in December :-)-X-"},
{"title": "Wet and wild", "date": "Friday 15 November 2019", "text": "Yesterday was just awful, I don't think it stopped raining all day and the temperature only reach 3° all day.  There are flood warnings in many places throughout the UK, thank goodness we are not in one of those areas, it must be just terrible for the people who are though, my thoughts go out to them.I took this photo through the kitchen door yesterday, the grass is just covered in leaves but with it being so wet we haven't had chance to get out there to clean them up.  Mark swept all the path last weekend but it was just too soggy to attempt to clear them off the grass. Marlene, when I see the grass covered in leaves like this I think of you saying that you don't like to see leaves on your garden, I think my garden would drive you nuts at the moment, lolYou can't see from the photos but the boarders are full of water up to and at some points, extending onto the grass.  It's going to take a while for that to dry out!There are still plenty of leaves still to fall, I just hope that by the time we can get out we won't be knee deep in them, lolI do love both Autumn and Winter, I don't even mind cold mornings, but rain, ugh! hate it.There were a couple of days last week when it didn't rain so when I finished work at lunch time I went for a walk around the local park.When I think of Autumn, this is what I want to see, beautiful colours :-)Beautiful gates to Mary Stevens Park, StourbridgeI've been taking along some bread to feed the ducks and geese on the pond while i'm there, they swim alongside as you walk, I felt like the Pied Piper, lol.  You can help yourself to food (for a very small donation) to feed them but I recently saw a post on FB that said that ducks were starving because people were no longer feeding them bread because they had been told it was bad for them.  I suppose it's better for them to have bread than nothing at all, especially in the Winter.It's felt like a very long week this week, three afternoons looking after Oliver and Bonnie after work and not getting home until after 6.30, make for very long days when i'm out of the house at 8am.  Joanne will be on maternity leave in a couple of weeks so at least I will only have Oliver to collect from school then.  Not sure what's going to happen when this new baby comes.  Don't get me wrong, I do love having them and I'm glad I'm able to help out, and I know I'm lucky that they all live close by and I can see them regularly, but I'm not going to lie, it's hard work, especially all the toing and frowing and In and out the car with two of them. There is a reason why Mother nature stops you having children when you are older, they tire you out, lolTonight I'm going to the cinema with my girls to see 'Last Christmas'  and on Sunday we are going to the Christmas Gift Fair at the NEC in Birmingham.   I've persuaded Mark to come with us this year, he is the original Bah Humbug when it comes to Christmas, so that should be interesting,  but I've told him there is free cheese and wine so he might just survive it :-)I'll be back soon with a couple of stitching finishes, once I can get enough daylight to take photos.See you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Secret", "date": "Sunday 3 November 2019", "text": "That's a misleading post title as it's not really a secret, and I haven't intentionally avoided saying it in a blog post, but as time is marching along so quickly I should tell you that I am soon to become a Nanna again :-)Grandchild number 4 (I know, 4!!!) is due to arrive very early in January.Bonnie will have a baby brother to fuss over, she is a proper little girl and loves anything to do with babies so I'm sure Joanne will have plenty of \"help\"Joanne posted this on Instagram a while ago now to announce the happy news, Bonnie looks in shock, lol but she is already talking about her baby brother and I know she will be a wonderfully kind big sister.So next years stitching will be much the same as the last few years, lol.  Another 'baby's first Christmas' ornament, another birth sampler and another Shepherd's Bush stocking, (did you wonder why I bought another shepherd's Bush stocking chart last weekend?? :-)I haven't done a lot of knitting this time round because Joanne still has lots of little cardigans that I made for Bonnie, and Jenny has passed on the ones I knit for Arthur. I have made a new  crochet blanket though.The first photo is probably more true to the coloursI wanted to use up some Stylecraft Special DK from my stash so came up with this rather than a granny square.I think it came out ok, and it's different to the other blankets I made for her last time.I also made a little cowl this week.  This was a kit I bought from The Cotton Pod at Yarndale last yearI'm not sure I will get much use out of it though, I don't really like the way cowls sit, but it might be ok under a coat.  It worked up really quickly after sitting there waiting to be done for over a year, lol.Can you believe we are in November?  This year has really flown by, they do say that the older you get the faster time goes, and I think that's so true.  Christmas is just around the corner, again, I have already made a good start on present buying, I would like to have it all done by the end of the month so that I can enjoy a stress free December.I always aim for this every year but it hardly ever happens, but we'll see.Hope you all have a good crafty weekSee you soon-X-"},

{"title": "We all made it through the rain and floods", "date": "Saturday 26 October 2019", "text": "The rain continued this morning making for some scary moments on the roads leading to the Nimble Thimble.  The main roads were fine but once you got onto the lanes there were some pretty big floods to negotiate.  Wales is a series of hills and valleys and so when it rains to the extent that we have had over the last couple of days of course the water runs down the hills and fields faster than the drains can cope with and there is no where for it to go, so you end up with these mini lakes in the roads.I had to turn around at one coming back this afternoon (not this one) because is was just too deep to drive through.  It must be terrible for the people who live near to where it floods like this, it must take weeks to drain off, especially this time of year.Thankfully everyone managed to get to and from the meet up without any mishaps.I've probably shown these same photos before from previous meet-ups so I apologise for the sameness.Chris always decorates the shop for HalloweenShe specializes in American charts and also stocks a lot of Shepherds Bush and The Drawn Thread.As I have bought quite a few charts recently I went with the intention of buying threads to kit up a few charts that are already in my stash, but of course, it's inevitable that you will come across at least a couple of charts that will just have to come home with you :-)Isn't that snowman cute!?  He was a last minute find (by Mouse), just as I was going to pay for my things, well I couldn't leave him could I? :-)My selection of over-dyed threadsSuzannah, by Carriage House Samplings came on the outing with me today, she hasn't seen the light of day in quite a few months.  I got some more done on her right arm and started on her skirt.When I got back to the hotel the rain had cleared so I went for a walk, I needed to stretch my legs seeing as I'd been sat on my bum all day :-)   The river drew me again, I think I've said before that although water, as in rivers and the sea scare me I am fascinated to watch it, from a safe distance.I don't think I would fancy living in that white house with the river like it is at the moment!  It's up quite a few feet to what it usually isI wanted to show you how fast the river was running so made this little video, if you look closely at the beginning you can just make out the heron hiding in the trees on the far side.This is my first attempt at a video, it's not brilliant but you get the ideaYou can view the video on here, but is better if you click to watch it on You Tube.I've got another day here tomorrow, hopefully the rain will keep off long enough for me to go for a walk along the canal.See you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Rain stopped play", "date": "Friday 25 October 2019", "text": "I had planned on having a nice walk along the canal when I got to Llangollen this afternoon, but the weather was horrible, I stopped off in Oswestry en route, it's a nice market town with some shops that we don't have local to us anymore so I always like to have a look to see if anything takes my fancy.  I got rather wet today though, the rain hasn't stopped all day!I got to the hotel about 3.30pm, dumped my stuff and just had a quick walk up the high street and then ducked into a café for an early tea, mushroom soup and a sandwich, and a pot of Earl Grey, very nice it was too.The river looked very rough, and scary! My room is on the top floor of the hotel and looks out onto the river Dee which in this section is very fast flowing, you can hear the noise from it when I open the window.I've had a nice quiet evening and done a little bit of stitching on Merry Christmas by Brenda Gervais.I'm close to finishing this one, just that section with the trees and snow to stitch, there are some snowflakes scattered around the piece but I'm not sure I will do those yet.I will try and post again tomorrow and tell you all about or stitching day at the Nimble Thimble, there is going to be  quite a few of us this time.  I'm off to make a hot chocolate and have a chocolate malted milk biscuit (or two) before I turn in :-)See you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Busy, but not with crafting", "date": "Monday 21 October 2019", "text": "I haven't got a lot of spare time for crafting at the moment.  I only work part time but in addition to that I do look after two of the three grandchildren at least three afternoons a week and also take Oliver to his swimming lesson on a Monday evening to help Jenny out.   On the afternoons I have them, by the time I get home and have tea and a shower and sort the cats out I'm ready for bed If I'm honest!Most of my stitching is done at the weekends when I can sit down for a longer period of time, I hate getting my stitching out if all I can spare is an hour, I like a good chunk of time if i'm going to stitch.  I suppose I could pick up some knitting but I haven't been feeling the knitting lately, although I have got a Wool Warehouse order coming this week to start a jumper which I'm hoping to cast on this weekend.So not really a lot to show, except this project bag I made a few weeks ago.  I used a pattern by Ellie of Crafthouse Magic, she has it for sale in her etsy shop, it was fairly easy to follow, even for someone like me with limited sewing skills, lol.  I used a couple of fat quarters that have been waiting to be made into something useful for a few years and, I'm quite happy with it :-)  The drawstring cording has to be changed when I can get some more, (it started to unravel when I was threading it through) and the wadding is a little bit thick but that was all I had to work with at the time.   I will definitely make some more using Ellie's pattern when I have the time.My reading has slowed down too of late, but I took Bonnie to the Library last week and went for a browse myself, this was on the 'quick reads' section.I had seen it doing the rounds but I tend not to read books when it seems like everyone is reading the same book, don't ask me why,  I't's just one of my weird traits, lol.  I haven't read this author before and I'm really enjoying it.  I like his writing style and it's good to be reading a British crime novel for a change.  As it's a quick read I only get it on loan for a week so I'ts got to be returned tomorrow,  I'm already well over half way through so i'm sure I will be able to finish it by then.I don't often read biographies but this one caught my eye while I was thereHow could I resist :-)  I have this one on loan for longer but I think it will be the next book on my list.I've been enjoying watching some podcasters doing Vlogtober this month, love watching Gaynor of  Tales From Cuckoo Land podcast and Alli from Little Drops of Wonderful, I've recently been watching Sherri from Olli and Bella too, I don't know how they manage to fit in recording bits of their lives throughout the day, edit and upload  but I'm so glad they do, it's nice to share other peoples everyday things rather than a staged podcast sometimes.   It seems that if you are a true podcaster you make granola, lol.  I would never have thought of making granola myself until I saw Gaynor and Rachel, (from Sew Ray me podcast) showing how they made theirs, I had a go and now i'm hooked! This is about the forth time I've made it now and it is truly much better than shop bought.I do like a good selection of nuts and seeds in mine, this time it's hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, poppy seeds, sunflower seeds, I use good quality oats, some maple syrup, a sprinkling of salt and a good sprinkling of cinnamon over the top and a couple of tablespoons of coconut oil.   Once it's cooked I add the raisins and dried cranberries.  I've been having it with Greek yogurt and fruit for breakfast, even Mark, who is definitely not normally a granola eating man has said how nice it is :-)This tray made up a large and a small jar.This weekend is our annual Halloween stitching meet-up at the Nimble Thimble, I'm staying over Friday to Monday and really looking forward to a day of stitching, chatting and eating yummy cake :-)  I will also be enjoying some much needed 'me' time :-)I will try and post some photos while I'm away over those few days and share what I've been up to.Have a lovely week, see you soon.-X-"},
{"title": "Yarndale escapades of two numptys", "date": "Wednesday 9 October 2019", "text": "It was our second year visiting Yanrdale and again we made a long weekend of it. In normal conditions it would take around 3 hours to drive to Skipton but the weather on Friday was just horrendous, the traffic on the motorway was not heavy but because of the torrential rain it was just crawling along.Joanne was driving, I took these photos while we were on the motorway, around lunchtime, so you can see just how bad the weather was!When we set off Joanne asked me for the postcode because she didn't have the paperwork for where we were staying at hand, I googled it and because I didn't have my glasses on showed her my phone, she put in the postcode and off we went.About an hour into the journey Joanne questioned our arrival time and the postcode, it was then realization dawned, we had been travelling for an hour in the WRONG direction!!You just couldn't make this up could you, lol  Luckily when we discovered our stupid mistake we were able to get off the motorway we were on and right onto a motorway that was heading in the right direction.  It still didn't alter the fact that we had added unnecessary time to our journey, which, (taking into account food and toilet breaks) took us around 7 hours!!What a pair of numptys The stupidity didn't end there though,  yours truly did not pack a towel, deodorant or face wash!Luckily Joanne had packed two towels and the other things I could buy.  Thankfully the rest of the weekend went without a hitch :-)I think it must have rained all Friday night and Saturday morning the rain was horizontal, honestly, I've never seen so much rain!, It looked like getting wet!  I said to Joanne, \"oh look Noah is coming across the field to collect us\"It seems that one of us had still got our numpty head on, because she came to the window and looked🤣🤣So dramas aside we had a good weekend, the weather could have been better, although the biblical rain on Saturday morning had passed by the time we got there and the day ended up sunny and bright.  The rain did return on Sunday however and it more or less rained all day, I think it put some people off  visiting as the Sunday was really quiet, nice to walk round and look though.  I did feel sorry for some of the stall holders though as some of the overnight rain had seeped in, one stall in particular had very soggy samples. Last year I got a bit carried away with buying things, this year I went with purpose and thought about what I was buying, I don't want to end up with lots of pretty yarn sitting there not being used, I haven't got the space for it, and to be honest It overwhelms me when there is lots of 'stuff'.  So, I bought just three skeins of yarn this year :-)One from West Green Loft Yarns and two skeins of  un-dyed yarn, unfortunately I've misplaced the card with the name of which stall I got the two un-dyed skeins from at the moment.I keep being drawn to un-dyed yarn at the moment, this one will be hats for Bonnie and Arthur and at £5 a skein it was a bargain buy.  It's a Falkland yarn with merino so it's beautifully soft.I did buy some other things of course, a couple of  Christmas presents for Joanne, and Joanne might have bought me a couple of Christmas presents on behalf of Stevie and Jenny too :-) .  I bought some needles in sizes I hadn't got but the other things that came home with me were in kit form, so I will share what those are as I get round to making them.I'll leave you will a couple of photos from the day, although I didn't take many because I kept forgetting!The obligatory Yarndale bunting photo :-)Teddies knitted for the Mercy Ships, this years charityBonnie lost in amongst the teddies, doing a really dodgy smile, lolSee you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Celebrate the seasons", "date": "Saturday 21 September 2019", "text": "I like all the seasons for different reasons but Autumn is my favourite.  I love when you can feel that change in the air, when it starts to get a little cooler, when the nights start to draw in and it gets dark earlier and you can pull down the blinds and get cosy.  I like that things start to slow down and I feel like I have more time to do the things I want to do, when the nights are lighter I keep finding jobs to do, which means less time relaxing, so I welcome Autumn. As much as I love planting things for Summer in the garden I don't mind pulling them up and putting in things for Autumn and Winter either, when it comes to this time of year i'm ready for a change.  Each season has something good about it and time flys by fast enough without us wishing it to be Spring or Summer again, they will come round soon enough.The last two weekends the weather has been really more summer-like though, and I enlisted Marks help in the garden, we added some top soil to the border by the path that we never got round to doing last year and we also planted tulip bulbs, lots of tulip bulbs.  If they all come good both sides of the path should look very colourful come the Spring.He also got my seasonal box down from the loft, I couldn't wait to get pumpkins out  🎃.Not scary ones though, just the pretty ones :-)This was a new purchase this year from Home Sense, it has lights inside, although I keep forgetting to put them on!I haven't done as well as I'd planned this year with making seasonal ornaments, but you might remember that I stitched this one back in February.PUMPKIN SPICE FARM by Hands on DesignI got round to making it into a little pillow last week and  I LOVE how it turned out!I used the recommended orange chenille for the edging and the backing is some brown wool fabric I bought at one of the stitching shows we went to earlier in the year I do struggle when it comes to making up stitched ornaments, it' s like when you have spent all those hours knitting something and then you are faced with sewing it together, it can be very daunting. I'm not very adventurous with the finishing but I am getting better at putting them together, the key is to take my time I think, I tend to want to rush and see it all finished but I now know that, for me, it's better if I do one stage at a time so that I don't loose focus and start rushing and I'm more than happy with how this one came out :-)A week from today we we be in Skipton for Yarndale, we didn't think we would be able to get accommodation this year, but we eventually found an apartment just outside Skipton.  We are driving up on the Friday and coming back the following Monday and have tickets for visiting both days.The exhibitor list looks impressive this year and I'm looking forward to squishing lots of yarn, although I'm going with a list this time to try and avoid impulse buys.  I'll let you know how that works out, lolSee you soon-X-"},

{"title": "Lovely Lively Brighton ", "date": "Saturday 24 August 2019", "text": "I had a few misgivings as we arrived in Brighton.  First impressions were of  a rundown seaside town well past it's hey day, a little bit scruffy and lots of graffiti.  But we both changed our mind once we had got a chance to have a wonder around.  There are absolutely loads of shops in an area called The Lanes, just a short walk from the front, lovely independent shops selling everything from jewellery and clothes to records and plants.  You are spoilt for choice for places to eat too, Chinese, Indian, Greek, Turkish, Thai, Japanese as well as the usual pub grub and of course fish and chips.  We tried one of the Greek restaurants on Tuesday night and it was wonderful.The weather was kind to us too, although from these photos you would think otherwise!It was late afternoon when I went a little walk down to take a look at the Bandstand and the sea, It was quite warm but very very windy, that's whats whipping up those waves.  I love watching the sea but I wouldn't like to have been as close as these kids!Our hotel was right opposite this beautiful Victorian Bandstand, built in 1884 it is said to be one of the finest examples of Victorian Bandstands surviving in England today. It is rather lovely, don't you think?Another building from the Victoria era is the Grand Hotel, It was built in 1864 and still looks very impressive It was at the Grand Hotel In 1984 during the Conservative Party Conference an assassination attempt was made on the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, she of course survived but the bomb killed five other people.The Upside Down House on the beach, It looks rather quirky but we didn't go in.Brighton has a pebble beach, so this pool is a great idea for the kidsLooking back from the PierThe i360 viewing tower is on the seafront, and despite the fact that I not like heights you should all know by now that I have to go on the highest things, lolThe pod takes you up 450ft, you don't even realise you are moving.The building of the Royal Pavilion started in 1787 it was built in three stages and was a seaside retreat of King George IV.  The rooms all have Chinese or Indian themes, I was taken with the dining room and the staircase which was wood but painted to look like wicker, very clever, and must have taken an age to do.There is a no photographs inside the rooms, rule but I did manage to take a sneaky one of the dining room before I was told off by a rather stern guide :-0That chandelier is HUGE, there is a dragon at the top which is carved from wood and is 10ft long.There is more information HERE if you are interested.We also took a trip on one of the tour buses which was quite interesting, funny thing happened though, the tour was advertised as £14 each, ( but you do get three tours), we got on and paid by card, we were charged £20 for the two of us.  When I mentioned it to Mark and he looked at the ticket we had been charged the pensioners price😮😮😮 Cheek!! I've got another two years before that privilege, we had the last laugh though because it saved us £8😁😁😁 We didn't go straight home on Wednesday, Mark had to go to his office to pick up drawings, (the firm he works for is based in Portsmouth), and from there we decided to stop in Marlborough, Wiltshire, we stopped off there a few years back when we visited Stonehenge, it's only a little town but has some nice shops and pubs.  Mark has the rest of the week off too so I put him to work in the garden yesterday morning moving some plants and emptying the window boxes, cleaning windows and putting weedkiller around the drive, while I gave the house a good clean, we were all done by early afternoon so I was able to sit and do some stitching on Arthur's Christmas stocking, (I will get around to taking a photo this weekend).  Today we have emptied the shed and evicted the spiders and put everything back nice and tidy, I have also given my little blue house a good clean and washed the curtains and the rug, It was too hot to sit in there this afternoon though, but it's all clean now for me to do that tomorrow.I offered a book on my last post, there was only Tina (no blog) who said she would like to read it so Tina, it's yours.  I will message you later but if you are coming to stitching on Wednesday I will bring it with me.Another long post, I seem to have an inability to keep things short, lolHave a lovely Bank Holiday weekend if you are in the UK, it looks like August will go out with a heatwave so being British we will all be making the most of it 😎😎 because it could all change in an instance!See you soon-X-"},
{"title": "A visit to one of my most favourite places", "date": "Sunday 18 August 2019", "text": "Oliver will be in year 2 when he goes back to school in a few weeks time and they are going to be learning about Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot, Jenny said it would be good if he could actually see where things happened so we planned a day trip on Saturday as a surprise for him.  He loves history programmes and is into reading the Horrible History books, so where better to go than London.  We had a great day, just the three of us, we can get the train straight though to Marylebone from our local station, it takes a little over 2 hours, but it seems like no time at all when you are on a train.Apart from the sights, he loved the Lego shop (of course!!) and the M&M shop, Jenny had booked us a table at the Rainforest Cafe for tea, which is a fun experience, it's decked out as you would imagine, like a rainforest, complete with sounds and animated animals.  I thought the food and drinks were on the expensive side, (£4.50 for a small bottle of coke!!) and the cheapest adult meal was £20.  But having said that, the food was good and the portions quite large and I suppose you are paying for the atmosphere.  Oliver loved it, so that's what counts.Our first stop had been Buckingham Palace to see the changing of the Guard, but after waiting for around half an hour security came and put a board out saying that there was no changing of the guard ceremony that day (boo).  I did feel sorry for an American couple who were getting on a boat this morning so wouldn't get to see it, they said that the people at home wouldn't believe they had come all this way and not got to see it!There were things we didn't get to do, the London Eye didn't have tickets available for any times we could do that day and we didn't have time to climb the Monument, we have already talked about taking him down again soon and we will get tickets in advance next time.It was a long day, we got on the train at 7.20am and did't get home until 11pm, needless to say I needed a lie-in this morning!I have managed to get into the garden for an hour this afternoon just to give the grass a quick mow and tidy up.  Lots of things are now passed their best, but the roses are still giving flowers.  We have had quite windy weather and it's blown my Sweet Peas over, I keep twisting them back but they keep getting blown again!My one Dahlia that didn't get eaten my the slimiesI had to pop to Lidl this morning and came back with a blueberry plant.I've no idea how big they grow, Mark planted it up in this pot, it's quite a large pot so should be ok for a whileWe've both got next week off work, we are going to Brighton for a few days (until Wednesday), I don't know what we will do for the rest of the week, I would like to have at least one day at home doing nothing but stitching, I haven't picked anything up all week and I really need to crack on with Arthur's Christmas stocking.  It's Bank Holiday a week tomorrow, so it will be a nice long weekend to tag onto our week off, then it will be September, you can already feel a change in the air in the mornings.  Anyway, this post is already longer than I planned, (will my posts ever be short, lol)I'm off to have a nice long soak in the bath and start a new book, oh before I forget, I have just finished See You in September, by Charity Norman, I bought the book at a book sale and I will put it in the charity bag to pass on, unless someone would like it?  I really enjoyed it so if you think it's one you would enjoy please leave a comment saying so and I will send it to you.  (If you look on Amazon or Goodreads you can see if it's something that appeals to you)If more than one person wants it I will put the names in a 'hat' next Sunday.Right, i'm really going now, lolSee you soon-X-"},

{"title": "A wonderful day out", "date": "Sunday 4 August 2019", "text": "We gave the Mums and Dad's a day off yesterday and took all three grandchildren to the zoo for the day.   There is only nine months between Bonnie and Arthur so the practicalities of pushchairs and car seats and all the paraphernalia that small humans have means that I have never had both of them together.  My car isn't big enough to hold three car seats and two pushchairs so for our trip yesterday we did a car swap with Joanne as she has a seven-seater.The weather was kind to us, it was warm but not too hot to walk round and the kids were really well behaved, we encountered no tantrums.  But it did take both me and Mark to look after the two little ones, they had reins on when they wanted to walk about,  but goodness they might be small but they are fast!!The zoo is very close to us so they have all three been many times, Joanne has a yearly pass so they are pretty frequent visitors but they still enjoy seeing all the animals and we had a great time.Bonnie letting Arty have a go at blowing her bubblesBig brother giving telling him how it should be done :-)Dudley zoo no longer has elephants just this statue which stands just opposite to where they used to live.We saw the parakeets up closeAnd the Ring Tailed Lemurs - This one was quite happy to pose for several families to take photos before he thought he's done his bit :-) We saw the new cute baby camelWith his not so cute raggy mum!We saw the chimps, which I still find very weird But Arty was particularly fascinated withHe was also in awe of the lovely gently giraffes But Bonnie wasn't so sure of the Sea lion - he was big, not sure you can see in this photo just how big he is.  He does look very much like a lion don't you think?  he even has the mane.Isn't nature strange.We had a picnic, which involved more running round after Arty than sitting down, lolWe took silly photosAnd enjoyed ice creamsBut I only managed to get one photo with all three of them together, just as we were leaving.They each chose a stuffed animal from the shop on the way out, because you can't go out for the day without coming home with a treat, can you :-)I thoroughly enjoyed our day with these three little people, they really are a joy, I love them so much, my whole world is in that photo above 💕💕💕 I think the mums and dads had a good day too,  it's not often they get to have a whole day child free so they really appreciated it, although both of them said they didn't know what to do with themselves at first, lolSee you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Is It warm enough for you?", "date": "Thursday 25 July 2019", "text": "The news said today was supposed to be the hottest day on record, I think they got it right for once, It was 24°C when I got in the car to go to work this morning and 38°C when I came home at 1.pm.I'm in denial of the heat when i'm in the office all morning with the air conditioning on, but as soon as I step out the door it's like stepping of the plane when you go on holiday, the wall of heat just hits you.  I came right back home today, no way was I walking around town in that heat.I haven't done a lot in the way of crafting this week, apart from being too hot I've had a cough that's kept me awake most nights since the weekend.   I had Bonnie yesterday and Tuesday but came home at tea time both days and lay on the sofa to try and get a bit of rest.  Anyway, I feel a little better today so hopefully the worst is over.I picked my first few sweet peas from the garden this week :-) Not many yet but the beautiful smell from just these few has filled the sitting room, you can smell them when you walk out onto the patio too.  It's the first time I've grown sweet peas so i'm happy they have produced some flowers.Just a few other things that have been doing well tooRosesThis one was already here when we moved in and has never produced many flowers, until this yearI planted this one last year, it's on it's second lot of blooms this seasonCourgettesI have a courgette I can pick, lol(No rude comments now please 😆😆😆)I'm so happy that these have grown, but is it ok to just pick one or two as they become big enough?These are a first too so I have no idea.Lettuce leaves, another first.I have been picking these leaves quite regularly, I sowed some more seeds a couple of weeks ago to keep it going, they have saved me quite a bit of money really, Mark won't eat salad and if I by a bagged salad or salad bowl I usually end up throwing half away.  So this gets a big thumbs up from me :-)(We put copper tape around the container and have not had any problem from the slimy creatures)LiliesSome yellow flowers have joined the pink ones.These are really tall, i'm glad i had the foresight to put a support around themJust so you can see how hot it really is, even my hydrangea flowers are wilting in the heat.  I've just been out and given it a good watering, hopefully it will perk up.A sneaky purchase.  I was bored at work one morning and was browsing yarns, I came across West Green Loft Yarns and treated myself to two more little minis for my blanket.These are Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr BingleyI'm just loving these pastel shades at the moment, it's strange how I always seem to be drawn to blue shades, even though if you asked me I wouldn't choose blue as a favourite colour.I can't wait to start on my mitred square blanket once the weather cools down.I'm going to try and do some stitching on Arthur's stocking for the rest of the afternoon and watch a couple of podcasts.Stay cool 😎See you soon-X-"},
{"title": "Yarningham weekend, did you go?", "date": "Sunday 14 July 2019", "text": "I finished it!I was so happy to put the last few stitches in this piece last weekend.  I thought it was going to be a relatively quick stitch when I started it and I had planned on starting the Autumn one right after, but honestly, I can't do it right now.I don't like stitching on Aida, I found it made the thread fluffy if I used the length of thread I usually would to stitch, and I don't like the stiffness of the fabric.Having said that, I do LOVE how it came out!I had a frame that I was going to use but in the end It was too small so I went to my local stitching shop, (Betty Stitch Kit) and asked Mark if he could make me a frame, no glass.   While Sharon was getting my threads together for my next project, (more about that next time), Mark had made me the frame!  How good was that!  I wanted something more rustic looking and this frame is perfect.  I've been going to Sharon's shop for supplies and framing for years and apart from being lovely people they also give the best service.This weekend was Yarningham, and this year Joanne also came with me.We were both quite restrained, I knew I wanted some more minis and some buttons but we didn't go with anything else in mind.Of course I had to get my minis from Kelly 😀 and I finally got to meet her too, she is just as lovely as you would imagine her to be.This is one of Joanne's purchases but as she can't knit she's passed it on to be to make for Bonnie.I resisted buying full skeins of yarn, (actually, Joanne said to me, mum, you are not buying any yarn to knit socks until you have finished a pair 🤣🤣🤣).Well that told me!Until I saw this one, and you know, one day I will finish a pair of socks, (I will!!)I love how the yarn has been wound at the bottom of the label so that you can see how it works up.I fell in love with this little stitch marker bracelet, which I shall probably wear when I'm not knitting too because it's pretty.And I did get buttons, a lovely colourful bunch :-)I've got no photos of the actually event to show you because it wasn't until I got back home that I realized I hadn't taken any!  I'll leave you with some of the pretties in my garden at the moment instead 🌻🌼Until next time, I hope you all have a lovely week-X-"},
{"title": "Geeking out on history again", "date": "Sunday 7 July 2019", "text": "I've been feeling much better in myself these last couple of weeks, I think getting out and about has gone a long way to helping.  I'm feeling much calmer, less anxious, and more in control.  I've been trying to be present in whatever task i'm doing instead of thinking about what i'm going to do next, that's harder than it sounds when you are used to rushing around, but i'm sure it's helping.My back, neck and shoulder feel much better too.  I went for my third massage on Friday and she said that she is very happy with the improvement, there is less tension in my shoulder blade although my neck muscles still need some work.  I will go again on Thursday and then we will decide on the frequency from that session.  Having a massage seemed so extravagant, and had I not been off work I don't think I would have made the effort to go to be honest, but I'm so glad I did, I think It has really helped and once this problem is under control I think it's something I will continue with just to maintain my stress and tension levels.So, to continue my new mantra of giving myself some 'me time' I took a little jaunt to Kenilworth Castle on Saturday.  The weather didn't look promising but the rain kept off except for about half an hour, although the sky was grey and I had only taken my phone for photos, so I apologise now for the washed out sky shots! I will just say now that this post is long, if you are not interested in history or looking at photos you might not want to go any further, and that's ok.  I like history and looking at photos and looking back on past blog posts to remind myself of good times so I make no apologies, just saying ☺  Kenilworth is about a 40 minute drive from us, and I really don't know why it's taken me so long to visit considering my interest in History, I think in my mind I thought it was further away than it actually is!If you have never been to Kenilworth Castle you really should put it on you list of things to see because it has a fascinating history.  It dates back to the 1120's and was established by Geoffrey de Clinton, in the 13th century it was added to by King John and in the 14th century John of Gaunt made it into a Palace.  It was also favoured by Lancastrian Kings, Henry V built a retreat at the far end of the lake, Pleasance in The Marsh'  In 1563 Elizabeth I granted Kenilworth to her favourite, Robert Dudley and he turned it into a Palace, probably hoping that eventually he would be able to persuade Elizabeth to marry him, (and we all know that didn't happen!)  The building on the right, the Great Tower is the oldest of the three buildings, it would have had a keep and a draw bridgeThe building in the middle with the ornate windows is from the 13th century and was built by John of GauntThe building on the left is the one that Robert Dudley had built for Elizabeth I, her rooms were at the top.  You can now reach the top via a series of stairs and stand in the bedroom that once belonged to Elizabeth.  (If walls could talk😉)John of Gaunt's building.This would have been the great hall, obviously there would have been a floor, you can see underneath was a series of store rooms But you can still see the window seats and the fireplace.The large opening on the left would have been a doorway. You can see where the grand staircase would have been, (the grassed area), leading up to that doorway.  The space to the right is where the huge kitchen would have been. All around the castle now is beautiful countryside, but all this was once covered by water, it was flooded in order to make it impenetrable An original window in the Great Tower17 foot wide walls in the Great TowerStable block, the ruin in front of it was once Collegiate ChapelLeicester's Gate House built in 1571 /1572Above the entrance you can still see his initials carved into the stoneThe fireplace is original and was rescued from another part of the castle to be put hereAgain, you can see his initials and the raged staff.There are a couple of room in Leicesters gate house to see how it would have looked, on the upper floors there is information on Elizabeth and Robert Dudley and also the story of the man who saved Kenilworth Castle, (Thank you Sir Siddeley)Section of the Gatehouse gardenThe Privy garden was created by Robert Dudley for Elizabeth and been re-created as closely as possible to what would have been here through letters found giving a detailed description.It was accessed via a corridor and steps leading down to an archway.The small building at the far end is an aviary, and yes there are canaries in there 🐤(Terrible photo with a washed out sky!!) The smell from the roses was wonderful as you walked into the garden.If Elizabeth was impressed by all the effort and expense the Earl of Leicester had gone to, (her 19 day visit in 1575 bankrupted him)  the woman was still not for marrying.If you want to find out more the English Heritage site for Kenilworth Castle is HEREThe A Bit About Britain site is HEREBoth websites can tell the story so much better than I can, I do it just for my own recordSee you soon-X-"},
{"title": "The most wonderful ruin you will ever see (probably)", "date": "Sunday 30 June 2019", "text": "Witley Court The house dates back to the 17th century and was bought by a Thomas Foley in 1655.  The Foley's were Ironmasters and made a fortune in nails during the Civil War.  I was taking to one of the guides and apparently one the Foley's invented a nail making machine and that was what made his fortune.In 1833 the house was sold to to the trustees of  William Humble, Lord Ward,  in order to clear debts.William Humble later became the 1st Earl of Dudley and the house stayed with the Dudley's  until the 1920 when the estate was sold in lots.  The house along with 800 acres was sold to Sir Herbert Smith, a carpet manufacturer from Kidderminister, he had electricity installed and reduced the number of staff.  Sadly in 1937 a fire broke out in the east wing and although the west wing was untouched Sir Herbert decided to sell up, the house was stripped and left to decay.Fortunately for us in 1972 the Government rescued it and it is now in the care of  English Heritage and is there for all of us to enjoy.  The grounds are beautiful with woodland walks and plenty of places to picnic and the Perseus and Andromeda Fountain is one of the best fountains I've ever seen.  Every hour a canon like sound goes off and the fountain is fired up, it's wonderful! Imagine when the house was at it's best and looking down the gardens to that fountain, it must have been a sight to see!Still is a site to see, but you know what I mean.I spent all afternoon there and still didn't see everything so I will definitely be going back again, It's was only a thirty minutes drive but was a whole world away.Of course it had a very nice tea garden and It would have been rude not to partake If you follow THIS link you can read all about the house and it tells it so much better than I could, I hope you do, it's very interesting.(I have included a little video of the fountain, but have no idea if it will work once I click publish)-X-"},
{"title": "This is not a cooking blog", "date": "Thursday 27 June 2019", "text": "I had trouble getting to sleep last night, no doubt due to the lie-in on Wednesday morning, so I got up earlier this morning and cracked on with some cooking right away.  I find it too much bother most nights just to cook for me so while I had the time I thought I would stock the freezer with things I can just get out on the days I don't feel like cooking, or for the days I get in later from having the kids.  I've been guilty of not eating properly again lately, I tend to eat breakfast late, I can't face eating first thing so have my breakfast at work around 10.30 and I don't usually bother with anything at lunch time, that then means I'm hungry late afternoon and if I eat late afternoon i'm not hungry at tea time!Clearly I need to change things.Last weekend I made Lasagna, chilli and spaghetti bolognase, this morning I made two curry dishes.  If you are familiar with Slimming World you will probably recognise these two.Sweet Potato CurryI love sweet potato curry and will have it with either boiled rice or cauliflower rice.Mushy Pea CurryYes, I turned my nose up at this too when I first heard about it but honestly, It's really nice. Honestly!!I can have this with either rice or it's lovely over some salmon or a basa fillet too, so I've got a couple of meal options there.I also made a batch of tomato and mascarpone sauce to have over pasta, so together with Last weekend's  lasagna, spaghetti bolognese and chilli I made I have a few options for tea timeMy favourite breakfast is overnight oats made with either porridge oats or muesli but I've been wanting to make my own granola for a while to have as a change, so I made a small batch of that this morning too.  I think I may have slightly overcooked it, but It smells delicious, just hope it tastes as good as it smells 😃I've come to the conclusion that I'm fussy about food.If I were to list here everything I don't like you would wonder what I did like, so in an effort to try and eat better I've started to make a list of the meals I actually like eating and i'm going to try and make a four week meal plan from that list, I'm up to week three at the moment and struggling.I'd be interested to hear if any of you work to a meal plan and if you do, does it help?By the way, these are week day meals just for me as Mark is away during the week and would not eat either of the curries I made today anyway.  (Although he will eat quorn Swedish style meat (less) balls because I never told him they were quorn  😁 I've gotten away with that twice now, lol  If I'd told him they were meat-free he would immediately say he didn't like vegetarian c***p.Luckily he doesn't read my blog so will never find out 😈If you would like to know how I made any of the above, let me know and I will add them to my recipe page.Thank you to those who left comments about the plant names.  I sort of thought that the white flowering one was a Mock Orange Blossom but it does not have a smell at all, which is strange.  I've looked it up and apparently we will be able to cut it back once it's finished flowering.-X-This morning was a later start as I took advantage of being able to have a lie-in.  I'm not a morning person, never have been so when I get chance to lie-in I take it :-)  I had nothing In particular to get up early for, the appointment for my massage was not until lunch time.  I've been suffering with really bad muscle tension in my neck and into my shoulder blade, It got really painful a couple of weeks ago and all the doctor could advise was taking ibuprofen, not something I want to keep taking long term so I booked to have a massage last Friday to see if it would help.  She could not believe how tense my muscles were, she kept saying 'wow!' and 'oh my goodness!' and I'm thinking, at last, someone who understands how much pain I've been in!I can actually feel the muscles popping when shes working them, it's a little uncomfortable and a bit painful, but in a nice way, it feels so much better afterwards, and if it works I can stand a bit of that sort of pain.  Today was my second visit and I feel even better after this one, so something is working.  She has said that these muscles must have been tensed up for a long time, she will be able to soften them up but it will take a few sessions. Other than going to my appointment I've had quite a lazy day at home, I was looking around the garden this afternoon and there are some plants that were already in the garden when we moved in and I have no idea what they are, but I know that quite a few of you who read my blog are into your gardens too and you might be able to help me out?This one is huge and I would like to reduce some of the height after it's finished flowering.  Last year it only flowered on the lower half, which was a bit strange, this year there are hundreds of flowers all over! It did get a bit wind damaged a few weeks ago and a couple of the boughs are very low over the grass.Please leave me a comment if you can help with names for any of the plants above.Thank you for all the lovely comments on yesterday's post.  It's a pity I can't leave my machine out all the time so I could practice more but the small bedroom where I keep all my crafty supplies is not big enough to fit a table in as well as the single bed.  Perhaps one day I could just have it as a craft room but for now I'm not ready to tackle that job.I haven't got anything planned for tomorrow except for some freezer cooking.Living the high life here, lol-X-"},

She has done two boxes so far and these are both of them(mmmmm, there are only nine little minis there, one must have been camera shy)They are so lovely and colourful I can hardly bear to use them! I have test knit a couple of mitred squares to see how they work up but I don't think I will make a proper start until after the summer.  It's going to be a long term project anyway once I get going, so for now I just going to go on collecting :-)I had a nice relaxing start to my week off, my breakfast was eaten with a lovely view of the garden instead of eaten in between taking phone callsLate morning I went out with Stevie for couple of hours as she wanted to get some plants form the garden centre.  We both had a bargain hanging basket, I wasn't going to get one for by the front door this year because the front of our house always seems to take the brunt of any wind or heavy rain, but for only £8 I couldn't pass it up.We had some lunch at another garden centre and then I played with my sewing machine for the rest of the afternoon, the results of which I will show you tomorrow.I was able to get in the garden on Sunday morning and have a good tidy up, it rained later in the afternoon so I'm glad I went out when I did.I've got more roses this year, I remembered to feed :-)And my fairy glen is looking rather cute now its surrounded by flowers.(I know, I know, rather childish, but hey ho, I like it)That's it for now, see you soon-X-"},

I love it! and it's so nice to knit with, not at all like the commercial sock yarns I've tried with in the past. Ok, that's it for now, i'm off to enjoy a bit more stitching time while the light is still on my side, later I will do a few more rounds on my sock.I hope you have all had a good weekend and hope you have a great week :-)See you next week (when I will again be in a different location!)-X-"},

one with lots of photos :-)Christmas ornament stitchingI got two stitched ornaments done for March.  The Santa one you saw on my previous post and this one from Country Cottage NeedleworksFrosty Forest \"Snowy Deer\" I must confess that I really didn't enjoy stitching this one at all, I don't know why, I just didn't.I left out the detail in the snow at the bottom and also left out the little confetti snow flakes.I like it now it's done, although if you look close at the snow at the bottom you will notice that I must have picked up the wrong white at some point because it's a different shade in some places!Birmingham NEC Craft FairA couple of weeks ago I went with my daughter, Joanne to the NEC in Birmingham for the Creative Craft Show.  This happens every March and I haven't missed one for years.  However, over the years it has become less about stitching and more about card making, scrap-booking and sewing.  There are very few stalls catering for cross stitchers now, which is a shame, but I did manage to pick up a few charts that I liked.Another purchase from the show was related to this book I'd bought for the bargain price of a fiver from The Works a couple of days before.I was really happy to find out that Cool Crafting, (where you will find all things related to Luna and friends), would be there.  Their stand was very popular but I did manage to wrestle my way in to purchase a pack which included everything to make lovely Luna :-)I can't wait to start making this, I've already copied and cut out the templates from the book but I want to get a few things out of the way first so that I can give it my full attention.There were some yarny purchases in March too.The third Literary and hand dyed yarn society package from Dandelion & Dogwood arrived.I'm not a fan of sparkle so when I opened the parcel I was a tiny bit disappointed, (sorry to sparkle lovers) I'm sure it will knit up lovely though.  I suppose that's a risk you take when you sign up for these things, you can't guarantee that you will love every package.  I won't sign up for the next three months as this was rather expensive I thought, these past three months were a Christmas present to myself :-)My April mini's club yarn arrived from Lay Family Yarn and oh my goodness I love it!The guest dyer this month was Nora George.Look at how lovely they are, I'm really happy with this parcel :-)Sunday was Mother's Day here in the UK and the girls treated me to afternoon tea at the Laura Ashley Tea Rooms in Birmingham as one of my gifts.If you have been a reader of my blog for a while you will know that we do love to have afternoon tea and have tried many places over the years including some 'posher' places like The Savoy and The  Dorchester in London, (which were both lovely by the way).  The Laura Ashley Tea Rooms looked lovely, decorated nice and bright and all the tables had beautiful white tablecloths, but, the afternoon tea was not the best.  We were told that we could have a re-fill of finger sandwiches but no waitress came back to ask if we would like more, likewise with the tea and coffee, we had to get up and go to ask someone for more drinks, so service was not up to much.  Me and Joanne had Earl Grey tea and I had to ask the waitress to check if that was what we had because it really didn't taste like any Earl Grey that I've ever had, (and I think I've tried just about every make out there!).  Although the cakes do look nice on the photo they were not brilliant and the scones were cold and very dry.  Perhaps others were more wise to the service and food than we were because there were only 3 tables in use all afternoon, not really what you would expect on Mother's Day.   So I'm afraid it's a thumbs down from us for this tea room :-(We had some really sunny weather again last week so I spent quite a bit of time in the garden and gave the grass it's first cut on Thursday, I must say that our garden is probably at it's best in Spring, we have loads of Daffs thanks to the previous owners and last year I planted both early and late Tulips, so although one lot has finished we still have some to come.The Forsythia is on either side of the garden and really brightens everything upThe Pieris has grown really big, I compared it to some photos I took a few years ago and it really has had a growth spurt!  This variety is a Forest Flame.I've still got some leaves to get rid of, I've filled the compost bin and our green bin but still have a leave pile the back corner of the garden, (out of sight), our first green waste collection of the year is late this time, not until the second week in April so the leaves will have to stay where they are until then.The weather was beautiful on Saturday and as Mark was at work I spent all afternoon sitting in my little blue house stitching and listening to my book, bliss.Speaking of books, I read five books in March, the best one I think was The Perfect Child although I also enjoyed listening to Getting Rid of  Matthew.  Jane Fallen's books are quite easy to read or listen to, not very deep or meaningful, but can be quite funny.So, that's about it for the goings on in March, we have a busy April to come, a wedding, two birthdays and of course Easter. I have chosen my April Christmas ornament to stitch but there is some knitting I want to get done this week so I probably won't start that until next weekend.If you made it to the end, thank you for indulging me :-) if you didn't and only skimmed through that's ok, I understand not everyone is interested in all that I do :-) Either way I wish you a happy April and I'll hopefully be back sooner with a shorter post rather than later with a mega long one :-)Take care-X-"},

The guest dyer was Fine Fish YarnsAnd this was February's parcel with guest dyer Betsy MakesUnfortunately I missed the sign up for the one for March+ but I've made a note in my diary so I don't miss out on the next one.I have seen so many people making mitered square blankets and they look so pretty I thought I would like to have a go too, so that's what these mini's will be for, obviously I have a lot more to collect yet though.Also so from Lay Family Yarns,  I signed up for one of their Valentine kits, this one is  Long Lost Love LettersAnd my final spurge in December was to sign up to the  Literary & Hand Dyed Yarn Society from Dandelion & Dogwood.  The idea behind this is that Ami and Jen choose a favourite book they have read and use that for the inspiration to dye the yarn.  This idea really appealed to me and so I signed up for the three months subscription, there will be an option to sign up for more after that which I'm hoping to doThis was what I received in January, don't you think they did an excellent job with matching the yarn?I hadn't read this book, but I have watched the film and really enjoyed it.February's box arrived last week and the book that inspired the yarn was Eleanor Oliphant.I read this last year and really enjoyed it.   There is a Ravelry group to accompany the yarn society where you can discuss the book and share what project you are knitting with your yarn,  but I must confess that I haven't joined the group, but I am enjoying receiving the yarn :-)I'm in no rush to knit anything with these lovely yarns at the moment, I'm happy just to have them in my stash and admire them for the time being.Have a great week-X-"},

{"title": "All the UFO's, well stitching ones anyway", "date": "Sunday 20 January 2019", "text": "There have been a lot of posts on Instagram this last week about tidying up your crafty space.  I don't have a craft room as such but I have been able to re-claim our smallest bedroom for storing all things crafty since Oliver is not sleeping over now that Jenny isn't working late's.  It was slowly turning into a dumping ground though, as rooms that are not occupied have a habit of becoming, so this week I've made myself go in there for at least half an hour each day to sort out drawers and boxes. I found out all my cross stitch projects, UFO's and finishes not \"fully finished\" and also two projects that I really don't think I want to finish the stitching on.So here we go....The stitching is all finished on this one but it was too large for an ornament and I didn't know what else to do with it. (any suggestions would be welcome).This is a Lizzie Kate stocking and I didn't know how to go about finishing it! (you can see how old this one is!!)Pear Tree is a very old finish, older than the one above but I remember that I cut the fabric too close to the stitching and I was so annoyed with myself that I just shoved it in the cupboard.  Every now and then I get It out and still don't know what to do with it.This Carriage House Samplings piece has been in the cupboard for a couple of years too, I just need to take it to be framed!  I remember I was putting off taking it at the time of finishing the stitching because I knew it was going to cost probably £50 plus to get it framed.  It's more than likely going to cost me more than £50 now, but I really should take it in.  I have two more of these 'Girls' to stitch and I know they are not everyone's cup of tea, but I do love their quirkiness.Prairie Schooler Santa's waiting for minimal stitching to get them done.All the backing card and fabric is all cut out ready to finish these. I started the one below in 2017, LHN 'Snow White' I just lost motivation with this one, but I do still like it so it will get done sometime.Remember this one?I have no idea why this one didn't get finished for Christmas, it was so close.  I even had the frame all ready for it too.  Perhaps I can get this one done in February.These next two are really old, old projects, so old I can't remember what this one is called, lol. I forgot to look when I pulled it out yesterday, I do know that it's supposed to be a pillow and it's still on the scroll frame.I still quite like it so perhaps someday I will finish it This one was started as a SAL with a fellow blogger, Judy, who lives in Canada.  Judy no longer blogs but we do speak on Instagram, I'll have to ask her if she ever finished hers.Sampler Game board by The Drawn Thread I do want to finish this but I'm not keen on the fabric, it's very 'floppy'This is how it would look once finishedThe next two projects are the ones that I no longer want to carry on with. The first one is Elizabeth Jackson by Samplers RevisitedI like it but I haven't got the wall space and the colours really don't go in my house anymoreHomespum Elegance Summer PatchesThis is stitched on the called for cushion, not much stitching left to do, but again, won't really go in my house now.I am looking to sell the last two partly stitched pieces because it really would be a shame to leave them stored in bags.  I have listed them on ebay and on a FB group, but If you know anyone that would be interested in buying either of them then do let me know, my email is in the sidebar.So that's my Stitching UFO parade It's not as many as I thought and certainly no where near as many as some people have on the go but I would still like it to be less.  I'm going to try harder this year to keep more focused, and now that I've sorted these out you never know I might decide to work on the ones I want to keep and fully finish the ones that are stitched. Have a great weeksee you soon-X-"},

{"title": "In the making", "date": "Wednesday 22 August 2018", "text": "Everything I'm making at the moment is at the 'almost' finished or 'needs to be fully finished' stage,  then there are the projects that have been started but were abandoned in favour of new starts, (most probably the ones that are almost finished!!). I suppose that's the downside of starting too many things.Arthur's cardigan needs sewing upBonnie's cardigan needs the last bit of sleeve knittingDolls blanket about half doneBonnie's Christmas stocking.I really need to get this done very soon!There is just the bottom border and her name to add to the top and the charms to add.Two Christmas ornaments, one for my tree and Arthur's first Christmas ornament.Stitching is all done on these they just need finishing into ornaments.Projects put to one side.A scarf I started early in the yearI still like this and want to finish it, scarves can get a bit boring though can't they?My cotton summer top.I still love this too, so do want to finish it.Then there are the two pairs of socks I startedI really really want to knit socks and eventually these will get finished I suppose, I find them so fiddly though.Then there is the Crofter blanket I started.I found this out just a few days ago, I've done about 30 squares, I think the pattern calls for 80 square but I'm just using up the yarn I've got.And the scrappy blanket (Although this one I can be forgiven for because I am using up scraps)I could probably definitely find a few more cross stitch pieces in the drawer upstairs which I started and put to one side, plus, there are at least two pieces that are more than half way done that i'm almost certain I will never finish and what do I do with with those??I don't want to carry lots of WIP's into next year, I would like to start the year with a clean slate, (realistically that's not going to happen!) but having lots of things on the go like this does make me feel uncomfortable and a bit overwhelmed.  It's hard isn't it not to get distracted by new things to make, especially when there are so many lovely projects posted on blogs and Instagram, not to mention those on Podcasts!!So what do you do?  Do you stay faithful to one project or just have a couple on the go at a time?  Or are you like me get carried away with starting something new?-X-"},

{"title": "Fantastic views and a bike ride - Cornwall Part Four", "date": "Saturday 11 August 2018", "text": "Feeding the piggies on Thursday morning.  I must admit I've taken quite a liking to these pigs :-)As well as the normal animal feeding on Thursday morning the kids got to groom and walk the pony around the field too.After second breakfast, (for Oliver anyway) we decided to walk into Padstow.  It's about 2 miles from the farm over the fields and down the lanes and out onto the Camel Trail  Below, Padstow in the distance, the tide was out on our walk downAnd was in by the time we were walking back againOliver enjoyed going through the kissing gates and over the stylesOliver the scarecrow!We had a quick stop off in Padstow for lunch and found the welly dog! Then we hired some bikes to ride the Camel Trial. Oliver can't ride a bike on his own yet so Mark had him on a hook-up. I haven't got a photo of me on my bike, but I was right behind them, lolWe rode from Padstow to Wadebridge, 5 3\\4 miles and It was such good fun, I don't know who had the most fun, me or Oliver, lol but I can tell you that It was me who ached the most after!That day we walked 4 miles to Padstow and back, and rode 11 and a half miles, from Padstow to Wadebridge and back, both me and Mark clocked well of 18,000 steps not counting the peddling!!Boy did we know about it by the time we got back to the caravan, but it was worth it for the experience, the fantastic views and the smile on Oliver's face.For me this was the best day of the holiday.-X-"},
{"title": "Visiting Eden - Cornwall Holiday Part Three", "date": "Friday 10 August 2018", "text": "The animal feeding was abandoned after the guinea pigs on Wednesday morning as there was a very sudden and rather heavy downpour.  We had planned on going to the Eden Project that day too and thought we would still go as planned because at least there would be places to take shelter should the rain continue.  As it turned out the day wasn't too bad, there was one or two showers but they soon passed.The walk down to Eden after parking is about a mile but all along the grass verges are planted with wild flowers that looked lovely even though they are now almost finished floweringIt was very busy, I think everyone had the same idea, not a day for the beach, but somewhere you can dodge the showers.I think Oliver had a good time, he does like plants and was keen to go and visit the plant shop later and buy a new cactus to add to his collection.  We both bought on of the succulents too.We did have a great find....this little fella.That's Marks finger, so you can see how tiny the little frog is. Some of the other plants I enjoyed seeing.I loved all the sunflowers and black eyed susanOne of the things Oliver had asked to do was have fish and chips at the beach and watch the sunset, so on the way back we visited Constantine Bay, stopping off on the way to buy fish and chips.We got back around 10pm, so it was a long day, but a good one.-X-"},
{"title": "Treyarnon Bay, Cornwall - Part 2", "date": "Tuesday 7 August 2018", "text": "After the animal feeding on Monday we visited Treyarnon Bay armed with bucket, spade and fishing net.Oliver had great fun in the sea, he was so excited and just ran right on in, although it was freezing in there many people were doing the same thing, on the other hand I was content to just get my feet wet. :-)We managed to catch some common shrimp,  although Oliver found it hard to concentrate for long on looking in a rock pool when there were waves to jump!Can you see them?Granddad had fun showing Oliver how to dig a hole so that it filled up with water and explaining how the water in the bottom was the same level as the sea, yeah, too technical granddad, sometimes I think he forgets Oliver is only five, lolTreyarnon Bay is a lovely beach and lots of people were taking advantage of the beautiful weather we are still having.  Today we slept in past animal feeding time, all that splashing about must have worn Oliver out!We did set out to visit Port Issac after breakfast and made it as far as the car park but after driving round it for about 15  minutes and not being able to park we gave up and went to Bodmin jail (no photos and to be honest it was over priced and not that interesting), then we went onto a lovely little town called Lostwithiel where we had a lovely cream tea.  There were a couple of really lovely crafty /shabby chic shops and a lovely little yarn shop, but alas it was closed, which could probably been seen as a good thing because I pressed my nose up against the window and they had some gorgeous yarn.  Mark did say he would take me back before we went home but it was a good 50 minute drive, so we'll see.-X-"},
{"title": "Trevorrick Farm Stay, part one", "date": "Monday 6 August 2018", "text": "It was a seven hour long drive on Saturday from where we live to St Issey just outside Padstow in Cornwall.  The motorway was stop start for most of the way and the weather was very hot, but we made a couple of stops so it was bearable.  Oliver did the usual kid thing asking are we there yet, only about a million times, lol and we had to tell him how many miles left to go every few miles, apart from that he was no trouble and travelled well, as in we didn't need the bowl, if you know what I mean.As I mentioned we are staying on a farm which is geared up for kids, but it is most definitely a farm.Each morning the kids get to go round and feed and handle some of the animals.We got to take the sheep for a walk tooCan you tell this was Oliver's favourite bit!There are chickens duck and geese free ranging as well as this fella.This morning It's  Grandad's turn to take Oliver on the morning animal feed and walk so Nanny can have a hours quiet, (and write this blog post), lol.Later we went into Padstow a lovely pretty fishing port.  We had a walk around the shops and then to the beach.I think today we are going to find some rock pools, Oliver is desperate to get a fishing net:-)-X-"},
{"title": "Just a bit of this and that chitchat ", "date": "Thursday 2 August 2018", "text": "Many people say it, and we all know that time passes, but seriously, where does all that time go?   It's not that I've been any busier than normal really, just more of the same old same old but yet another month has flown by in the blink of an eye.And talking of time whizzing by, can you believe that it will be Bonnie's 1st birthday in just over a week?  I just love this photo of Joanne and Bonnie, she is definitely mummy's little mini me :-)(And Joanne looks so young, you wouldn't believe she was 30 last year would you!)Joanne has just gone back to work 2 days a week, so now I have Bonnie on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons.  She goes to nursery in the morning and as it's literally next door to my office, (or as Google informs me, 167 feet), I collect her just after 8am and drop her at nursery and collect her when I finish work at 1.30.  Joanne's work is in the opposite direction so it makes sense for me to take her and they only live around the corner from us so it's all worked out ok. I've been taking Bonnie back to her own house on those two afternoons just because it's easier while she is still small, her toys are there and if she has a nap I can put her in her cot, (I did that yesterday and she slept for tow hours!).  Joanne has very kindly been providing me with my tea so at least I haven't had to mess about with cooking for one when I get back home, fair exchange i'd say :-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Marlene http://poppypatchwork.blogspot had a give away on her blog a few weeks ago and as I was the only one who actually said they wanted to be entered I won by default, lol.  I'm sort of glad no one else was in the running because look at all these seeds she sent meI'm going to be sharing some of them with Joanne as she is planning on getting their garden done next year, so we should both have very colourful displays.  Thank you again Marlene :-)Marlene has also been sharing photos of her houseplants recently, like me she has a spider plant which is producing lots of little ones.This is mineMy sister bought this for me when she was getting one for herself, I can't remember if it was last year or the year before but anyway it's done really well and is way bigger now than my sisters plant.I've given some of the little plantlets away but have more again now and some of them are even producing plantlets of their own, so you could say my spider plant is a granny, lolMarlene has been taking her baby plants to the charity shop, I never thought of doing that before but as I have quite a few this time I might do that once they are more established.I've only got another couple of house plants, an Ivy, which I have had for ages (and needs re-potting),and also a smaller one which came from a little bit that was broken off  the larger one. Strange how this one is more variegated than the other.I have no idea what this plant is, when I picked it up in Ikea I thought it was plastic and was surprised to find soil in the pot.  It's been sitting on my kitchen window ever since, it seems to like it there so i'm reluctant to move it.House plants seem to have fallen out of favour with the younger generation, of my three daughters only Joanne has any, the other two always say that they can't keep them alive, although I have to say I don't pay any special attention to mine, they seem to thrive better the less notice I take.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~My reading is still not what it was at the beginning of the year, I keep looking but everything out there looks more or less the same lately.  I activated my Kindle Unlimited again last month and got Anna by Amanda Prowse.  I know I've been very critical of some of her books in the past, I had one on audible some time ago and she was reading it and in my opinion she should just stick to writing, she just doesn't have the kind of voice to make a story come alive or even interesting.Anyway, Anna was a really really good book, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, it's still available for free on Kindle Unlimited at the moment.  There is a sequel to the book, Theo where we get to hear his side of the story, I haven't read this one yet, I just picked it up from the library this afternoon.Rather than writing a review I've linked both titles back to Amazon.  Let me know what you think if you read or have read them.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I've been doing some knitting, some crochet and some stitching too but unfortunately no photos because I haven't got round to taking any.  To be honest the only finish is the crochet one and I wanted to take a photo of that in it's setting.  I would be showing 'in progress' photos of everything else so hopefully there will at least be a couple of finishes in August.Talking of stitching, some of you may know that for the last six or maybe seven years I have been running a monthly cross stitch group at a local community centre.  I've been thinking for a while now that I would like to step down from that and so made a definite decision last month to do just that. One of the other ladies has kindly offered to step in and take over, so it will carry on, we have a lovely group of ladies, some of  them have been coming since the very first meeting so i'm glad it will continue.  I feel I made the right choice, what with all my other commitments I just didn't one more thing to be responsible for, I will continue to go and stitch with them when I can, but now I won't be obliged to go if I've had a busy week. Two of the ladies, Karen and Annabelle bought me a lovely bunch of flowers and a card just to say thank you, which was a lovely kind gesture.We are going on holiday on Saturday and taking Oliver with us.  It will give Jenny a break as she has had the two of them on her own for the last couple of months while James is stationed abroad.  He will be back the week after we come home and I think Jenny will be extra glad to see him!We are staying at Trevorrick Farm in Padstow, we thought it would be more interesting for Oliver as there are loads of animals and things for the kids to do.  It's been ages since we've had a holiday in the UK, I'm really looking forward to it, we have several things planned to do in the week, including a visit to the Eden Project which I'm sure Oliver is going to love.  Fingers crossed the weather will hold out for us.I think that's about it for my bit's and pieces catch-up.  Depending on time I might try and do a blog post every day while we are away, I've seen how some bloggers have their posts printed into books and I think this might be nice to do for Oliver as a memento of his holiday with us.  If I do though they will just be a quick post on what we got up to on that particular day, but i'll see how shattered I am at the end of each day, this is not going to be a relaxing put your feet up and read a book holiday :-)And on that note I shall sign off and say see you soon.-X-"},
{"title": "Using what you have", "date": "Wednesday 4 July 2018", "text": "I've had a couple of plain white Ikea pillows stored in vacuum bags for at least three years, maybe longer.  My daughter gave them to me and I did use them for a while but they were pretty boring really so I stored them away getting them out every now and then thinking I would put them in the charity bag, but couldn't quite bring myself to.Then I had a thought, (I do occasionally have a good idea).  I could crochet a pillow front :-)And best of all, it wouldn't cost me anything because I had plenty of Stylecraft sitting there taking up space.I found a tutorial for the pom pom edging on you tube, I think it was a Bella Cocoa tutorial and I love it!The second one is a bit more muted but again all yarn is from stash.I think this one needs pom poms too but Mark said it looks ok without, what do you think?shall I add some pom poms? maybe on the corners?A bit miss matched but that's ok for where they will be...more about that next timeThe back of both cushions look like thisI sewed the crochet front to the pillow cover by hand because I thought it would be easier than using the machine, and it was.It was one of those projects that just worked and turned out, (for once) how I had seen it in my mind.Don't you just love it when that happens :-)Until next time-X-"},

{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday 5 June 2018", "text": "It's been quite a stressful and worrying week.  Little Arthur has been in hospital for 7 days, Oliver has had chicken pox and we didn't think Arthur would catch it, but he did and he developed a high temperature.  When Jenny first took him to A&E in the early hours of last Tuesday morning she was sent home after being told it was probably due to the chicken pox, but she took him back again a few hours later because he didn't seem to be any better.And thank goodness she did.  I won't go into everything that happened but he was started on antibiotics and anti viral's right away.   It turns out that he had a Strep bacteria, his infection levels were really high at one point, (in the 70's), but now they are down to 5.  We are just so thankful that Jenny did the right thing in taking him back to hospital when she did, I shudder to think what might have happened if she hadn't.He came home yesterday but will be kept on antibiotics for the next five days, Jenny will need to take him to hospital every day for him to be given the antibiotics because they are given intravenously.  She said he is much better, I haven't been to visit him because I have a cold and don't want to pass anything on, so I will have to wait a bit longer to give him a big cuddle.As I said, Oliver has had chicken pox, he's been ok apart from a couple of off days and he did have a lot of spots, but he is better and back at school today.  Just before that Bonnie wasn't well for a week, at one point the doctor thought she might have measles but thankfully the rash only lasted for two or three days and her blood test came back negative for measles.  In the end they put it down to a viral infection, she is back to her normal happy self now, although this photo made me laugh, she looks rather puzzled at Nanna taking her photoAs you can imagine I haven't been in the mood for much crafting, I haven't done any stitching on Bonnie's Christmas stocking for about two weeks. I did cast on a little cardigan but have yet to finish it.  We are going away tomorrow, to Sicily, just for a week, usually I don't take any crafting on holiday with me but this time I might pack some knitting along with my books.  I feel guilty for going away but I have asked Jenny if she wanted me to cancel and she said she is fine with me going, I know that Arthur is on the mend now but I just feel guilty not being here to help her with all the trips to hospital and looking after Oliver, I've had Oliver every day while Jenny and James have been at hospital, Joanne will help out with collecting him from school if needed while i'm away because James will have to go back to base in the next couple of days.I haven't done my usual round of blog visiting this week, If I get chance while we are away I will try and catch up.-x-"},
{"title": "What I'm working on", "date": "Tuesday 22 May 2018", "text": "I had planned on making a start on stitching Bonnie's Christmas stocking at the beginning of the year, but with one thing and another that didn't happen.  I finally made a start at the end of April and although I haven't worked on it everyday when I have stitched on it I've made good progress.It's hard to get a good photograph of all because it's on a roller frame.  I've stitched the top border too and will leave adding her name till last.  This is Elizabeth's stocking by Shepherds Bush, stitched in the recommended Perle threads.  I'm hoping to get this finished by the end of June and that will leave me plenty of time to stitch one for Arthur too.  I stitched and finished one for Oliver for his first Christmas, you can see Oliver's stocking here Last year I bought a beach bag kit from Sew and So when they were having a sale, I forgot all about it until I was having a sort out a couple of weeks ago.  The pack contained all the material but not the wadding.  There were no making up instructions but after I called them they did email them to me right away.I'm really happy how this turned out, it's not perfect, the inside pocket is too high for a start, but I like it :-)I fashioned a bottom for the bag by cutting some thick cardboard and covering it with sticky backed plastic because I didn't want a saggy bottom!!I've had two days off work this week and I couldn't have picked two better days, the weather has been beautiful.  Yesterday I went for a lovely long walk and then stitched and caught up on some TV in the afternoon.  Today I sat outside all afternoon doing a bit of knitting and some beach hut stitching while listening to my audio book.  I feel like my batteries have been re-charged and I'm ready to face the office again tomorrow.Beach Hut stitching - I will reveal what these are for in a future post :-)I've done so much baby knitting over the last year, now it's time for something a little bigger, If It comes out ok this will be a top for me.  The back is almost done and so far I'm enjoying it.I've got most of my plants in the garden or in the pots now and everything is coming on nicely.I planted some Alliums for the first time, not all of them have come up though.  I didn't think any of the white ones had survived but then this one appeared and there is another one in the other bed which is just starting to open.The previous owner planted this Lily of the Valley, it's tucked away on the far side of the conservatory so you can't really see it, which is a shame but you can catch it's scent if the wind is in the right direction.  I've been picking some for in home and the smell is wonderful.I hope you too are enjoying some lovely weather :-)-X-"},
{"title": "Wool@J13 Confessions", "date": "Thursday 17 May 2018", "text": "I saw the Wool@J13 yarn festival advertised in a magazine for local events which came through our door a couple of months ago.  I'd never heard of it, and I hadn't seen it mentioned on any social media sites either.  Mark had his weekend planned with sorting the shed and garage out so it was the perfect opportunity for me to take a day out yarn shopping :-)The event was held at Lower Drayton farm in Penkridge, just a couple of miles off junction 13 of the M6, (hence the name,Wool@J13) .  which for me is only a 30-40 minute drive.It didn't look that busy when I arrived around 11am, the car park (field) is a few hundred yards away from the event itself but the kind farm folk provided a tractor / trailer ride up the lane.I was very pleasantly surprised, everything was set out in a big 'L' shaped marque, and there was plenty of room to walk round without bumping into each other.  Outside there were picnic tables and various catering vans, and as it was a beautiful day there were quite a few picnic blankets out too.I bet you are more interested in seeing what I bought than the food on offer, so here you go feast your eyes, lolThese were purchased from One Wool.The grey and the natural are DK weight and the lovely yellow, which looks nothing special in the photo but is actually quite a beautiful colour is 4 ply.  But best of all, because I told the stall holder that I might be back later because I liked the yellow he let me have this skein for £2. How lovely was that!From Dusty Dimples, on the right I Do Believe in Fairies a 4ply merino / nylon mix which I thought would be perfect for the Peachy Geometric shawl pattern from Sandra at Cherry Heart, (which I bought over 12 months ago) and the other skein has no name, is DK and will make some mitts because the colours go perfect with my coat.The grey Hot Socks and the Drops Fabel I bought for cardigans for BonnieAnd another couple of Drops because it was only £1.50 a ball an it would have been rude not to :-)I bought a lot, and I'm slightly embarrassed by the amount, but in my defense I do have projects in mind for most of it so I don't feel too guilty  ;-)I also bought a couple of gadgets, a gauge checker and sock blockers.I'm a bit annoyed because I didn't check the sock blockers close enough, I thought I was getting 2 when in fact there was only one in the bag.  My bad.Why do I need sock blockers?  Well I am slowly working my way towards my first finished socks, I've made it as far as the heel anyway, lolThe pattern is from Ellie at Craft House Magic.Last but not least of my purchases is a little pack of un-dyed yarn and some Kool-aid.I saw that Jo had bought something similar recently and I thought when she posted about it what a good idea it was to have a go at something new, so when I saw these packs I grabbed one right away, I've no idea when I'll get round to playing at dyeing because I've got enough yarn to keep me occupied with knitting for quite a while!  Here endeth my confessions, for now, but Yarningham is happening in July so I may need to confess again soon :-)-X-"},
{"title": "Empty nest, knitting and Tulips - (not necessarily in that order)", "date": "Friday 11 May 2018", "text": "Jenny had asked for a chevron blanket for Arthur like the one I made when Joanne was expecting Bonnie.  I had enough yarn left over from Bonnie's blanket to make another one so that was a bonus.Bonnie's blanketI thought it would be a fairly quick knit but that didn't quite happen.  I took everything with me when I went to Norfolk in March thinking I would make a start on it.  Well I made several starts, all of them ripped back, I just couldn't get it right, I kept ending up with either too many or not enough stitches.Finally I managed to get the first chevron done but I think I had problems on almost every single chevron after that, either too many or not enough stitches or I didn't like how my stitches looked, honestly, you wouldn't believe how many times I've ripped this blanket back!!But I persevered and finally got it off my needles, the ends sewn in and washed all ready for little Arthur, not that he will be needing it at the moment.  I did the peg blocking again :-)Arthur's blanketIt's identical except this one starts and ends with the purple yarn.I still have small amounts of the yarn left but It will definitely NOT be going into another chevron blanket anytime soon, lol.If anyone is interested you can find the free pattern on Ravelry.  I cast on 169 stitches, each chevron is 20 rows and I used King Cole Comfort Baby DK.It is a lovely pattern and very easy to modify, (the difficulty I had  knitting it this time round was of my own making and my inability to count to 10. ;-)~~~~~~~~~~~~I'm slightly obsessed with the garden at the moment, I bought one of those little plastic green houses and it's full of plants just waiting to go into the window baskets and tubs, I've also grown a few things from seed this time and they are doing well although they are taking over the conservatory now so I will be glad to get them outside.In October I found a bag of tulip bulbs in the shed, I'd obviously bought them the year before and never got round to planting them.  I put the majority in this planter, the others I planted in the garden and never thought they would come to much because our resident squirrel kept digging them up!But they turned out to be the best thing about this Spring, the pink came first and they bought a lovely pop of colour to our garden.  Then came what I thought were going to be white onesBut no, they are red and whiteThey are so beautiful, like they have been painted :-)Because I just bunged them in this pot at the last minute and threw away the label I have no idea of a name, if anyone does, then please let me know because I want to buy more of these for next year.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~And the empty nest.....Stevie-Leigh and her boyfriend, Darren, moved into their house over the weekend, so I now officially have an Empty Nest! It feels very strange her not coming back from work and asking what's for tea, and even more strange that she is grown up enough to have a mortgage and all that goes with being an adult.  Stevie is the youngest and I still think of her as being a teenager and to be honest I still did everything for her while she was living at home, I will miss her, but that doesn't mean that I'm not going to enjoy the extra time and less washing and cooking ;-)-X-"},

{"title": "Offpiste", "date": "Wednesday 25 April 2018", "text": "When I went to the craft show at the NEC in March I bought a kit to knit an asymmetrical scarf, I was really drawn to the colour and the yarn was really soft and squishy.  It's called the Off piste scarf and is from The Wool Shop Leeds, I don't think they have a bricks and mortar shop any longer, just a website.The pattern and two balls of James C, Brett Twisted yarn were included, I chose the shade T3, but the kit does come in other colours. It's just so soft and drapey, I'd definitely consider using it again to knit another scarf or shawl.It was a lovely day when I washed it and I decided to hang it on the line with some pegs to weight it down, I bet the neighbours wondered what I doing, lolThe weather was glorious for the majority of last week, this week the temperatures have dropped again, I'm glad I took the opportunity to get out in the garden while it was nice.The daffs and the forsythia have finished now but they do bring some colour while they are here.Just a few days of sunshine and the white tulips are joining the pink ones And the Pieris has turned a glorious red.In just a few days the Hostas doubled in size and the anemones, which I had forgotten I'd planted were a nice surprise.The previous owners planted lots of Primula's so we have them dotted all over.My fairy garden :-) Not everyone's cup of tea, but it makes me smile when I look out my kitchen window.Mark thinks I'm totally insane, but seeing this little house lit up at night makes me smile :-)Something else that made me smile, our cheeky squirrel, he was in no hurry to move from his sunny spot on the bird feeder!Thank you to everyone who stopped by to leave congratulation messages, Arthur is already growing so fast, he didn't loose any of his birth weight but has gained 7oz in just over a week!Oliver is taking everything in his stride, being the only one for so long we did wonder how he would react to having another small person in the house, but he's enjoying being a big brother, that may change in a few years when he has to share his toys, lol.Until next time-X-"},

{"title": "I'm still here", "date": "Thursday 12 April 2018", "text": "Hello! I really haven't been very consistent with this blogging thingy this year have I.But I'ts one of those things that if you leave too long it's hard to come back because the amount of stuff to say becomes overwhelming, so I won't bombard you with lots of things today, just a few snippets from the month of March.The March weather was a bit up and down here in the UK, we had wind, rain, The Beast From The East, (and his little brother, the Mini Beast) which dumped two lots of snow on us.  My garden has still not recovered from all that and the last two days have been more like Autumn days, misty, dull and rainy, I hear we are promised better weather next week, I hope so because I've had enough of rain!My mood was pretty much like the weather too.  I came down with a sickness bug which put me in bed for two days and it was a full week before I felt better, then the blood tests I had came back showing I was deficient in vitamin D -  well that probably goes some way to explaining why I was feeling so low!  This week I feel like I've turned a corner, not completely there, but better than I was.We are still eagerly awaiting the new addition.  Jenny's due date was Monday, so any day now we will have a third grandchild :)I've knitted four new cardigans but forgot to take photos of two of them, they were just plain white ones though, these are the other two.I finished my ornament for March, well the stitching was completed in March but I didn't get around to making it up until March was out, (oops).(Please excuse the pictures, they were taken at night and the light is making the fabric come out green, it's not)We threw a little Sprinkle Baby Shower for Jenny and I made another nappy cake.As you can see we had snow that day so unfortunately a few of people didn't make it, but those that did had a good time, I think.I also went to Great Yarmouth with Joanne and Bonnie for a week, we had a couple of good days when the sun shone even if it was biting cold and we managed a walk along the sea font and despite the cold we managed to find a shop open on the beach front and had ourselves an ice cream, although it was so cold we sat in the car to eat them, lol I was very impressed with the beaches in that part of the country, and although it was out of season you could quite easily see that it would be quite beautiful on a warm sunny day.   We stayed at a caravan park called Cherry Tree, which again I was very impressed with, very clean everywhere. Here's Bonnie's first encounter with the children's camp site characters :-)She wasn't in the least big fazed by the giant frog and duck that appeared at breakfast, just bemused, lol~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~March was also the month that our youngest daughter, Stevie-Leigh became all grown up by being a house owner, with a mortgage and everything, lol.  We still can't quite believe it because in my head Stevie is still about 13 years old, although in reality she will be 24 next week, lol.Everything went through just before Easter and She and her boyfriend, Darren got the keys the day before Good Friday but they are not moving in just yet as there is quite a bit to do in terms of cleaning and decorating, which means Mark is now spending his weekend time DIYing either at Joanne's or Stevie's house, so in the meantime his list of jobs to do at home is getting longer :-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I noticed that I have a few new followers, (waves), which is lovely, do stop and say 'hello' because blogger won't let me click on names in the followers box anymore so I have no idea if you have a blog I can visit or not unless you leave a comment.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~That's it for this long overdue post, I'm going to get an early night just in case I get a phone call from Jenny in the middle of the night :-)Until next time-X-"},

{"title": "February in books", "date": "Wednesday 28 February 2018", "text": "I decided at the beginning of the year I would post each month about the books I've been reading.  I know like me, lots of you enjoy reading, and I think it's good to get new recommendations of titles or authors we might not have come across.  I'm always on the look out for something new to read and I love to read about the books people have enjoyed, or perhaps not enjoyed as much. Perhaps there will be a title from my reading this month that takes your fancy?February's  genre was Domestic Fiction600 hours of Edward is about a 39 year old man with aspergers  There are some funny moments, like when he tries on line dating and his straight talking but it's the very sad relationship he has with his father that really stands out in the book.It'a a very similar book to The Rosie Project with a more serious story line but with a character that was just as likeable. The Food of Love is about a family dealing with anorexia, told from the mothers viewpoint.Some parts of this book were good and I enjoyed (if that's the right word) but I had problems with other parts.  I really wanted to like this book but for me the writing was just to sugary in parts, (how many teenagers call their mum mummy even when they are upset or unwell) and I especially disliked the the mother, Freya. The choices she made concerning her daughter were just so unbelievable I wanted to shake her! Mockingbird was a brilliant read.  Caitlin is a young girl with aspergers trying to come to terms with her brothers death in a school shooting while dealing with her own problems.  When she hears people talking about needing closure she goes in search of it not really knowing what it is.This book was in the young adult section of the library but don't let that put you off  it's very well written.Another book for young people, in fact this one was in the children's section of the library but again it was a great book.Rose is an 11 year old girl with autism, she loves numbers and homophones but has trouble understanding her classmates.  She lives with her dad who isn't the most patient person but does love her in his own way.  He comes back with a stray dog one day which she names Rain, the dog becomes her best friend and when Rain goes missing in a storm Rose won't give up looking for her.This is only a short read but such a lovely one, well worth reading.My favourite book this month was Mockingbird, myleast favourite was The Food of Love.I'll be back soon with a crafty update-X-"},

{"title": "So that was January", "date": "Wednesday 31 January 2018", "text": "Is it too late to say Happy New Year?  Perhaps it is, but I hope you had a good January and the year ahead will continue to be kind to you.The weather has been pretty miserable here, a little bit like my mood actually, which is probably why I've not been around much.I've got away pretty light with the dreaded menopausal symptoms but lately I don't know, I can get so down about the silliest thing, and I have days when I'm so grumpy and crotchety that It's just not worth talking to me.  I'm best left alone when I'm like that, I come out of it in my own good time, but it does come across that I'm a right funny old cuss, (as my ex MIL would say).Still, I suppose all will come good, eventually, It's the people that around me that are suffering really but at least they know that it's not them personally I'm having a go at,  it's my hormones ranting!Anyway, with that little moan out of the way lets have a little look back to the end of December and my last couple of finishesAnother little corner to corner baby blanket, I love these garter stitch blankets, they are so lovely and squishy, and the bunting I made for Bonnie.This was my first attempt at making bunting, it's not perfect but it came out ok, (better than the dreadful photo, sorry)Over the Christmas period I joined in with the SAL that Priscilla and Chelsea were running for LHN Forest Snowfall. The SAL started on December 28th with the idea that it was a quick (ish) stitch, and somewhere in my fantasy mind I thought I would have it done in a week and it could be on display for the rest of January.Yeah right, like that worked!I managed to finish stitching and the framing on January 20th , so it took 24 days, I didn't stitch on it every one of those 24 days though, so I suppose that's not too bad, for me.The fabric is a mystery piece of 32 count linen which Sharon at my LNS kindly gave me because I couldn't make my mind up over fabric, the threads are as recommended except for the writing which I changed from the listed Deep Fennel to  Blue Corn, as many other have done too, although, I seem to have got a skein that didn't have much variegation.The frame is just a photo frame I picked up at the Range, I took the glass out and glued some fabric to the backing board and mounted the stitching onto another piece of board added some ric rac then attached it to the fabric covered board with some velcro, that way If I want to I can use the frame and  backing for another finish later.  The little snowflakes are some I saved from a garland that I no longer used and they are only attached with a dab of hot glue so would easily come off.Tina (no blog) told me about the Priscilla and Chelsea podcast last October, i'm so glad she did, it's such fun to watch, they are mother and daughter, Priscilla blogs here  and she does the most amazing things to her finishes, even if you are not a stitcher I think you would enjoy looking at her blog.This is the only stitching podcast I regularly watch, generally I find stitching podcast just a little bit boring, (sorry, just being honest!) but I do look forward to watching Priscilla and Chelsea on Saturdays, they are entertaining and funny and the viewing length is just right, typically less than 30 minutes.This next piece of stitching I started at the Beginning of December and I just love it so much!The chart was a birthday present in 2016, it's En retard by Madame Chantilly There are so many lovely chart in her etsy shop, I've got my eye on a few more that I'd like to stitch.I'm using the recommended DMC threads except for the rooves, (roofs??) for which i'm using Threadworkx 1089I really do like working on this one and hoping for a finish before too long.~~~~~~~~~On January 1st I set my Goodreads challenge for 2018, I just managed to complete my 40 book challenge last year and have set my goal as 50 books this year just because I think that now I've started listening to audio books in addition to actually reading I might get through more, we will see.I've started the year off with some good books in JanuaryYou can find them all on Amazon or Goodreads if you would like to find out more.My favourite book this month has to be Time and Time Again, this one has been sitting in the bookcase waiting for quite a while, I don't know why I didn't pick it up sooner!The book I enjoyed the least was The Perfect Summer.  It started off well enough but I sort of lost interest about half way thorough with all the high society goings on.There seems to have been a theme running through January's books, all of them set in the past with three of them having wars as the main topic.  I didn't consciously do that, it just happened that way, but it got me thinking that I might quite like to have a monthly theme to my reading so I've been looking at ideas for February and have come up with a list of 4 books, more of which I will post about at the end of February.This year I do want to make more of an effort to read the books that I have so I've cancelled my Kindle Unlimited membership for now, (you can cancel and rejoin whenever you please) as there are quite a few physical books on my to read list at the moment, although I am still keeping my Audible subscription because I quite like settling down with my stitching and an audio book.I hope you don't mind indulging me in Just another quick look back at Christmas before I gowith a couple of photos of Oliver and Bonnie at Christmas.Oliver looks so grown up!  He wasn't aware of half the presents he had, just ripped off the paper, passed what was inside to mum and was onto the next one, lolBonnie, bless her, she is such a pleasant little girl, and she absolutely loves her jumperoo, she has just started sitting up on her own this week, she's growing up so fast!And I just have to show you want the girls bought me for Christmas. (Again please excuse the terrible photos)I have wanted a record player for a long time, and they got me a perfect one :-)I just love it!! and have been enjoying listening to some Beatles records that Mark got me for Christmas and also a Whitesnake album I got for my birthday.  I'm looking forward to adding to my record collection when we visit some vintage markets :-)If you made it to the end of my mega post, thank you :-)  I've been trying to catch up on blog reading, but If I normally leave you a comment and I haven't for a while, I'm sorry, hopefully I can catch up and normal service will resume soon, I do love to see and read about what you have all been doing.That's it, I'm done :-)Take care, have a good February and I'll see you soon!-X-"},

{"title": "Oh baby, Books! ", "date": "Wednesday 25 October 2017", "text": "Where did October go! We just seem to be hurtling towards Christmas at an alarming rate don't we, it's really scary how as you get older the months seem to fly by faster.  Remember when you were small, and the year stretched ahead of you and it seemed like forever until Father Christmas would visit, or until your next birthday?  Ha Ha Ha, the joys of getting old(er).We had two birthday celebrations in October, Oliver turned five, five!!  (those five years went by far to fast!!), and Mark's birthday was last weekend, which we celebrated in London, as we have done for the past couple of years.I've read / listened to quite a few books in October.  Mark bought me the new Kindle Fire 8, the one with Alexa, a few weeks ago, the sound had gone on my other Kindle Fire, and to be honest I do prefer the feel of a real book in my hands, but seeing as I'd got a new gadget I took advantage of the free months trial of Audible and Kindle Unlimited, and I have to say that I've become a bit addicted to listening to audio books.  I do have to wear headphones otherwise I find I get distracted, and the narration on some is not the best, (accents and female voices are sometimes particularly bad!) But on the whole i'm enjoying it, I don't watch a lot of TV so this is keeping me entertained while i'm knitting, or whatever.I know there was a bit of hype when this one came out which I didn't get to be honest, it was ok but had I been reading rather than listening I don't think I would have finished itMark Edwards writes a good psychological thriller.  I enjoyed this one, (although the narration, by Napoleon Ryan was a bit strange in places, his female voice and Leeds accent were awful!)Mark Edwards also wrote The Magpies, which is really goodI've read a couple of Amanda Prowse, they usually jog along quite well.This one was read by Amanda Prowse herself,  I have to say she did a terrible job, (sorry Amanda) her voice was quite depressing and made the main character come across as weak and pathetic, but, again, I did enjoy the book despite that.I should imagine it's quite hard work narrating a book, so perhaps i'm being a little too judgmental, and they are just my opinions, you may feel differently.The next two books I 'borrowed' from Kindle UnlimitedI've never read any Paul Pilkington before, but this was good.Matt is trying to rebuild his life following the breakdown of a long-term relationship. The most important thing to him now is to be with his son, Charlie. But when Matt gets a sinister warning from a mysterious stranger, it sends chills up his spine. Then Charlie vanishes during a trip to the local pool, and it suddenly becomes clear that something is terribly wrong.Desperate to protect his loved ones, Matt goes looking for answers. Who’s after them? And why? Matt finds himself caught up in a web of lies that leaves him questioning everything he once trusted.Can he get to the truth before it’s too late?  (Blurb taken from Amazon)The Mangle Street Murders (The Gower Street Detective Series) is the first of a series of  4 books (so far as I can see).   If you like Sherlock Holmes you might enjoy these, or if you are a really huge Sherlock fan they might annoy you, lol, they are sort of a poor mans Sherlock I suppose, Sidney playing Sherlock and his side kick is his ward, March.  I'm almost at the end of this one have downloaded the others via Kindle Unlimited I'm tempted to keep Kindle Unlimited, well, for another month or so at least because a lot of the books have the option to switch between reading and narration, it's £7.99 a month, so the price of a book really, I'd be interested to hear if you have tried it and what you thought, did you think it was worth it?To finish the month of October off nicely I'm going to our annual Halloween meet -up at the Nimble Thimble this weekend.  Really looking forward to seeing everyone again and a day of stitching and perhaps a few new purchases ;-)  I'm making a weekend of it, so also looking forward to a little 'me' time too :-)Tonight Is our monthly stitching get together, and I actually have some stitching to take with me this month, (shock horror), It's a Christmas gift for someone small and cute and I'll show you more next time.Talking of small cuteness, my eldest daughter, Jenny is expecting again, so Oliver will be getting a new little brother or sister in early April and we are so happy to be welcoming another Grandbaby :-)So my knitting needles are still clacking away, lol and I'll show more of that next time too.I hope you enjoy the rest of your OctoberUntil next time-X-"},
{"title": "A bit of stitching has been happening, Halloween Ornament Exchange", "date": "Sunday 1 October 2017", "text": "A bunch of us who meet up at the Nimble Thimble for stitching days have a small FB group and Tracy recently organised a Halloween ornament exchange.  We were to stitch an ornament and include a chart and some sweets/chocolate in our parcel too.My recipient was Michelle, aka Mouse :-) I found a designer, Good Flora Stitchwort on etsy, (she has some lovely charts, go take a look),I chose Bubble Bubble and finished it as a little wall hanging.I found a little pack of Halloween buttons perfect for holding the hanging ribbonHere's the whole exchange I sent, luckily Michelle didn't already have the chart I includedMy package came from Chris, (I don't think Chris has a blog)A cute little pumpkin ornie.  My grandson, Oliver is mad about Halloween things and wanted to claim it for his Halloween tree, lolLove the chart she included tooThis weekend has been quite a busy one, It was my book club meeting on Saturday morning and later I went with Joanne to have high tea at a local garden centre.  It was a lovely treat, lovely to just sit and take our time.  Today was the annual Scarecrow festival in Belbroughton and I went with the girls again.  We started the day with breakfast at another garden centre before going into Belbroughton.  The weather was quite dull and dreary today but at least the rain kept off until we were ready to make our way home.There didn't seem to be as much effort put in by the residents this year, in fact it was quitedisappointing to be honest, the theme was Fables and Fairy Tales, plenty of choice as to what tomake, you would think, but we counted at least 3 Humpty Dumpty's, 3 Tortoise and The Hare,and about 4 Little Red Riding Hood .I thought these were the best effortsThis one was brilliant, a lot of work has gone into making theseAnd this giant Gingerbread Man :-)I've been flitting between various WIP's this week, nothing finished except for this little pair of shoesI came across the pattern on line and just had to knit them right away :-) They worked up really quickly, I knit both of them in a couple of hoursI do need to get a move on and finish some of the things I've got on the go at the moment, because I want to make a start on Bonnie's birth sampler this month  so that It can be finished and framed ready for Christmas.So many lovely things to make, so little time, lolI hope you all have a lovely crafty time till next week-X-"},

{"title": "An adventure in cushion making", "date": "Thursday 17 August 2017", "text": "Thank you for all the lovely comments welcoming my granddaughter to the world.  Mum and baby are doing fine, they came home on the Sunday.  I think they have had a few sleepless nights, which is to be expected but I think it still comes as a shock to the system doesn't it.I managed to get a couple more photos on my phone this week when I popped round, I loved this one showing her chubby cheeks :-)They have named her Bonnie.  Mmmmm, I must confess that her name is going to take some getting used to, she IS bonnie, there's no doubt about that, but as a name?  I'm not sure.  But as Mark has pointed out to me, it's not up to me.I've had a lovely few days off work this week, it's been nice to have a lie-in and potter about the house in the mornings.  On Monday I went to Willow Brook garden centre, we had passed it on the way to Stratford a week or so ago and I made a mental note then to pay a visit.  I went early enough to treat myself to breakfast, I had eggs benedict, which went down a treat with a pot of Earl Grey before having a wander round to see what was on offer.I picked up some plants on sale, some perennials which will fill a couple of gaps in the boarder for next year.  They were also putting out the spring bulbs so I picked up 3 packets of Alliums because they reminded me of pompoms :-)On Tuesday night I went on a cushion making workshop.I was browsing the internet in the morning and somehow managed to find myself following a link and a shop called Gutheri & Ghani popped up.  Apparently the co-owner was a finalist  on The Great British Sewing Bee, (I  must confess, I never watched the programme) but what caught my eye was the Piped Cushion Workshop which was happening that night, I ummed and ahed for an hour or so and then thought, why not! so I signed up.Now I'm not very good at sewing, I'd like to be, but I do get in such a pickle with the cutting out and seam allowances and measuring, It's all just so daunting, but nothing ventured nothing gained eh?Everything was provided and I paid online so all I had to do was show up.  The workshop ran from 6pm - 10pm but was in Birmingham, not the best place to be heading into at rush hour, consequently I was late because the sat nav wanted to take me on the busiest stretch of road, I had an idea there was a quicker way with less traffic but not knowing for sure I had no choice but to follow it.  I eventually turned up 20 minutes late, not a good start!There was only 4 of us and it was a  really good class, there was a choice of material and piping and a paper pattern and work-sheet provided and we were talked through everything step by step. Here is the finished article :-)I'm quite chuffed with it :-) The piping's not perfect at the corners but I think it would pass unless you wanted to be really picky, but I did make a pretty good job of the concealed zip, even if I do say so myself, lol. It's given me the confidence to have a go at home, I already have some material I'd like to use and I've had a trip to Birmingham Rag Market this afternoon to get some other bits and pieces I needed, so watch this space :-)I  hope you all have a lovely time until I see you again next week-X-"},

I have no problem with my own company :-)I found some white yarn out the other day and thought I would try and knit one more small blanket before this baby arrives.  They don't recommend having larger blankets folded up over baby anymore so I shall just keep this one big enough for a moses basket, it's just a plain knit from corner to corner with a YO at the beginning to give a pretty boarderI have got one more cardigan on the go to but only the back is done so not worth a photo.Last Sunday I also cast on a sock!I know I've been banging on about socks for so long and I have tried with various needle methods but I just wasn't feeling it.This time I tried magic loop and I think I like that best.This is how far I've got.(I have no idea why my camera want's to show this yarn blue, it's more turquoise)I did get almost as far as this with the other sock I cast on but I just wasn't happy with how the stitches looked.  This time, although it's not perfect I'm happier with it.And in true sock knitting fashion of course it had to have a project bag.Not an expensive one though, this one I picked up in the £1 shop, lolI like it, and it does the job :-)Next weekend I'm hosing Joanne's baby shower, I must admit that I'm starting to wonder what I've let myself in for and wishing we had hired the church hall or something.  I've got my fingers crossed for fine weather :-)In preparation for that I tried out a scone recipe in the week.  My scones usually turn out more like rock cakes, but these I must say looked the part.They passed the taste test too, although I will probably not cook them for quite as long next time.I would like to make these ahead of next Sunday and it does say you can freeze, but can anyone tell me, do I make them up and freeze them uncooked ?  or could I make the dough up on Saturday, leave in the fridge over night and bake on the Sunday morning?I would like them to be as fresh as possible so I would love any advice.A very quick catch-up this week, I'm off for that cuppa nowUntil next time, I hope you all have a lovely week-X-(I used  this Mary Berry recipe for the scones, if anyone is interested)"},
{"title": "Cottontail Rabbit and the cheat", "date": "Sunday 16 July 2017", "text": "Hello again, these Sunday post do seem to come round quickly.The weather forecast for today was hot and sunny, but there is drizzle in the air and a gentle breeze  so I've taken the opportunity to get though a pile of ironing this morning, a thankless task at the best of times but when it's hot it's a job I tend to put to the bottom of the list, so i'm glad that's out of the way.A few months ago I came across a free knitting pattern on Deramores, Cottontail Rabbit by Erika Knight.  I thought it was so cute and it reminded me of a little red knitted teddy that my sister used to have when she was a baby.  I already had some Stylecraft Classique cotton 4ply so I cast it on right away, but then I ran out of stuffing, so it was put to one side until I could (remember) to get more.I'm quite happy with how he came out :-)The green velvet ribbon was just some I already had and I was going to change it for a little knitted scarf, but for now i think it looks ok.I just love the little pom pom tail :-)Joanne thinks he is cute so he will be going to live in his new home in the nursery now he has has his debut.  :-)On Friday it was the sports day at Oliver's nursery so I popped along with Jenny to cheer him on.He took part in 3 races, hurdles a balancing-a-bean-bag-on-your-head race and one where there was a series of hoops which they had to stop and put over their body before running to the next one.Yayyyy, he won the hurdles :-)Mmmmmm, he cheated on the bean bag, held it in place and just ran.Not surprisingly he won this one too, lolHe also ran right past all the hoops in the hoop race so was the first a t the finishing line again little monkey :-)I think that's all for this week, while I've been tapping away on the laptop the sun has slowly made an appearance so it looks as though the rest of the afternoon is going to be much brighter.I hope you all have a lovely week, until next time-X-"},

{"title": "The holidays over, time to share the snaps", "date": "Sunday 25 June 2017", "text": "Well our holiday got off to a great start, we were enjoying a drink at the bar after we arrived and the earth shook, literally, yes, there was an earthquake, a 5.6.It was quite funny really, there were about 6 couples sat there, all talking and I don't think any conversation stopped, we looked at each other but it wasn't until it stopped that we said, was that an earthquake??  It lasted for 10 - 15 seconds and you could actually hear the rumbling and you could see the bar top shaking, but we all just carried on as though nothing happened lolWe went to a little Greek Island called Lesvos (or Lesbos), a place called Petra, which gets it's name from the rock (petra) that stands in the middle of the village.On top of the rock is a church, Virgin Mary of the Sweet Kisses. Cobbled street leading up past the rockView from the topSome of the cobbled streets in PetraView from just outside the villageI just missed the sun going down on the last night, but I did get the lovely red skyThe next photos are of our visit to Skala SikamininasThe little harbour in Skala SikaminiasThis is the place that made the news some time ago, where there was a surge of refugees, do you remember?There are only 100 people living in this tiny village and they helped save refugees from sinking boats as they tried to make their way across.  Sadly the news put tourist off and the village suffered badly as a result.  There is not much to see, just a few taverners, a pretty church and a couple of gift shops, but it's totally unspoilt and so tranquil. We hopped on the land train into Molyvos, it was about 15 minutes or so from where we were staying in PetraLooking back towards Petra from the land trainMolyvos, possibly the prettiest place we have ever been in GreeceThere are beautiful little cobbled streetsEvery little house has made the most of the little bit of space they have, making steps and patios pretty with plants and potsI loved the one below, not much space but wow, it looked beautiful!And I loved the little windowsAnd the shuttersWe walked up to the castle on the top of the hill, the views were amazingUnfortunately after trudging up the hill we discovered the castle was closed for maintenance work, so we were unable to go in, we did meet a little donkey though :-)We walked down to Molyvos harbour via the pretty cobbled streets and enjoyed a well deserved drink.While we were there the owner of the taverner caught an octopus right there in the harbour, i'd never seen one in real life beforeThe weather then suddenly changed, it looked like were in for a stormLucky for us it passed over with only a few spots of rain and then the sun came out again.We hired a car for a day to get to Skala Skaminias and just to enjoy the beautiful scenery round about really, but we had heard about a little Turkish Bath so we found that out too and enjoyed an hour alternately dipping in cold and then hot water, supposedly it helps with aches and pains, I can honestly say that it's made no difference whatsoever, lol, but it was something different :-)The holiday was not without it's problems, as usual I got bitten, whether by mosquitoes or something else I'm not sure but I had quite a lot on my feet and ankles and my foot started to swell up so I had to visit the doctor in Petra.  I came away with antibiotics to take for 10 days, antihistamine, take for the same time, 2 lots of cream to apply to the bites and some cream to stop getting bitten again!  Mark did have a few bites this time too, but mine seem to get infected, it's no fun.  This is one of the reasons we only go away for 7 days at a time now, once I start to get bitten I just want to come home, It stops being a holiday and becomes a battle of the bites!Lesvos is a beautiful place and it's a shame they have suffered with all the bad publicity that the refugee thing bought on them, on the other hand, the fact that not many people are visiting makes it a great place to go, it's Greece as it used to be in the late 1970's and early 1980's, very laid back and friendly with none of the commercialism. I know I've shared a lot of photos, I do like keeping a track of things I've seen and places I've been on my blog, It's nice to look back on.   I hope that you like seeing them to.I'll leave you with just one moreGreece is known for it's cats and Lesvos is no different, in fact I think there were more here than I've seen in other places.  It's very tempting to feed them, but you can't feed them all, (and Mark tells me off), although I did see evidence that some villagers do put food and water out for them, which is good.  We came across a mum with her kitties when we were walking and this one was just to cute to ignore.Look at that little face!Seeing how they have to scavenge around for food makes me so sad, On the last night I did save some of my dinner and we went back to the place where mum and kitties were so we could leave it for them, so I did manage to do my good deed.It's back to business as usual tomorrow, we caught up on some of the garden work today, everything seems to have shot up and greened up in the short time we were away, but Stevie has looked after my plants well and everything has survived :-)  The majority of the holiday washing is done and put away, the rest I will do in the week, just some food shopping to do tomorrow, I feel a salad week is called for after the indulgence of Greek food and more bread than I ever normally eat, I'm guessing the scales won't be kind to me on Wednesday when I weigh in :-(  Looks like going back to basics to get back on track.Until next time,I hope you all have a great week-X-"},

What did you think?I had a wander around the charity shops after work on Friday and came away with a couple of good finds.This chicken caught my eye.  I did have a lovely Masons chicken to keep my eggs in but it got broken when we had the kitchen done recently.  This one is not so eye catching but I think It fits perfectly in with my new kitchen colours :-) I've seen these vintage cake stands in many places and Mark has always put me off buying one, but this time he wasn't with me, so home it came, lol.It's in great condition and will come in very handy when we have Joanne afternoon tea baby shower :-)I'm really happy with this purchase.  I don't know if I should just give it a good polish and keep it this colour or should I give it an Anne Slone make over? What do you think?That's it for today, I hope you have a great week whatever you are up too.Until next time-X-"},

{"title": "A nasty finger and a new kitchen ", "date": "Friday 19 May 2017", "text": "I had just got used to posting on a Sunday and then it all went pear-shaped.Mum was admitted to hospital last Wednesday after an x-ray on her  index finger revealed a bad infection which had gone to the bone.She had been treated at her doctors surgery every week for the previous 6 weeks but the nurse recommended an x-ray this last time because it looked as though it had started to spread.She ended up at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham and they have taken biopsy's and cleaned it up under local anaesthetic.  The bone specialist she saw there was lovely and treated mums case as an emergency and did the treatment the following day.  At least two doctors that mum has seen at two different hospitals have said that her GP should have sent her long before it got this far, one even went so far as to say it was neglect on her GP's part.We have no idea what mum did to her finger , she says she can't remember doing anything, but some germs must have found their way into a small cut or under her nail bed somehow.  Her nail came off and the skin on the top of her finger had just peeled away.  It didn't look pretty I can tell you!I took her yesterday to have the dressing changed, it looked better but not closed up and i'm sure I could still see bone! (I took a photo to compare next week when I take her again).  We won't know what the infection was until her appointment on June 12th.I'm not going to put a photo on this page because truly, it is not nice, if you have a strong stomach and are NOT eating go and have a look in the tab at the top of this page if you want too.  But don't say I didn't warn you!!!!!So, I've been running backwards and forwards every tea time to mums to get her tea and put something up for her supper and lunch the next day and help get her tablets sorted, (it's her right hand which is making it difficult to handle things, plus, she has arthritis so it's very awkward for her).  My youngest sister has been going up to wash her, she can't get the bandage wet at all so even though mum hates the thought of her daughter doing something so personal for her she has no choice at the moment.It is best that I don't dwell on what my eldest sister has contributed to the help else I might start to rant, all I'm going to say is when she goes up she thinks it's more of a social visit and just sits and talks, about nothing really, gossip.  She's a talker i'm a doer, before she has finished telling everyone what she is going to do, it's done.  I can't be doing with it, so i'm avoiding her if I can because I don't want a falling out, and anyway she has an answer for everything and can't see she is doing anything wrong, it's just so frustrating.  See, i'm starting to rant!I've still been going to work and I've also had Oliver twice overnight this week so as you can imagine I'm shattered.  I got back in home at 5.30pm yesterday after the hospital trip and sorting mum out, had my tea and a bath and was in bed by 8pm.  I just hadn't got the energy for anything else.On a happier note, my kitchen is finished, Yayyyy.  We still have to decide on a blind and order a splash-back , I'm hoping we will find time to do that soon.  Of course having the kitchen done meant there were boxes to sort and things to put away and I've almost  got that all done now.  The next big thing is Mark starting work on converting part of the garage into a shower room come laundry.  Although I will be able to shut the door on that while it's being done so it shouldn't cause too much disruption to the rest of the house, (she says hopefully).I'm really happy with what we chose, our kitchen is not very big as you can see and the previous owner had not made the best use of the space to be honest.  We have opened the doorway back up into the garage (this is where the shower room come laundry will be), you would think that this would make the space smaller but it has had the opposite effect, everyone has said how it feels much bigger and brighter.  I think there is a temptation with a small kitchen to fill all the available space with cupboards, but in my opinion that just closes the space in.  We have a larder unit for all food stuff and opted for deep drawers for pots, pans plates etc.  I love the drawers, it was one of our better ideas :-)All my kitchen gadgets and baking tins i'm keeping in the pantry under the stairs.It was an opportunity to have a good clear out and get rid of all those things you keep but never use, or all the duplicate things, I had 3 large mixing bowls, why I would need 3 large mixing bowls I have no idea!  Now I have one, the one I used to use all the time anyway :-)The appliance that both me and Mark are loving having again is the dishwasher.  For almost three years we have been without one and it's soooo good to have one again.  It's lovely to walk into a clear kitchen :-)The weather has been pretty miserable the last few days, from pottering around the garden last week though I will say that the ground needed a good soaking, we just don't want it all summer do we.I'll try and make some time next week to share that little baby cardigan I'd started last time, it came out so sweet, i'm really pleased with it :-)  Tomorrow I'm having a day out with Joanne at the Baby Show in Birmingham, i'm sure we will come back with lots of lovely goodies :-)Until next time, take care-X-"},
{"title": "Sometimes two colours are enough", "date": "Sunday 7 May 2017", "text": "I finished another baby blanket for Joanne a couple of weeks ago but only just got round to taking pictures to show you.  I used the same King Cole Comfort that I used for the chevron blanket I did for her a couple of months back, this yarn is just so soft and snuggly, and If you're looking for a reasonably priced yarn then you can't go wrong with this for babies.  I'm very happy with how this one came out, the colours are white and silver, although the silver is showing more blue on the screen, it is more grey/silver in real life, depending on the light.I also made a start lasts night on a little cardigan, a free pattern on Ravelry that I found earlier in the week.Knitted top down so no sewing together, i'm loving that :-)I'm using Katia extra fine merino for this one, and again this is just so soft and lovely to work with.My colours are not showing up true today, which is a shame because this is a lovely duck egg blue.  Katia don't have names for their colours, just numbers, this one is colour number 67.Yesterday was Yarn Shop Day and I found out that Christine Perry aka Winwick Mum was going to be at Christine's (City Knits if you are looking online) in Bournville, Birmingham.  The shop is about 25 minutes drive from me so I thought I'd take a trip over as they had Christine's book on sale.I didn't go until well after lunch time and I'm happy that they still had some books leftAnd she was signing them :-)Now I have no excuse, I have everything I need to start my first pair of socks.Perhaps this will be the week when I take the plunge :-)I know there are quite a few people who read my blog who knit socks and I wonder if I could ask you a couple of questions?Do you prefer to knit on DPN's or a small circular? and is there a difference to your knitting with either method?Tension squares.....did you knit one for your first ever pair of socks, or did you just jump in and start?I must admit that I have never knit a tension square but I am feeling that I should, I would hate to put in all that work and they not fit.Any advice would be appreciated.Until next time-X-"},
{"title": "Raindrops on Roses - April", "date": "Sunday 30 April 2017", "text": "I'm joining in with Jo of Through The Key Hole and her post of favourite things for this last day of April.Perhaps it's a 'getting older' thing but the months do seem to be flying by at an alarming rate. so it's good to reflect on some of the things we have enjoyed over the past month.The weather has been quite mixed this month, but we have had some lovely sunny days and I've really appreciated the colours in our garden.  One of the things I do like about our house is that the kitchen window looks out over the garden and it does look good early in the morning or late afternoon when the sun is low. I'm very happy that one of my miniature roses has a bud :-)This is one of two I bought last year for 99p.I've struggled with finding books that really grab me this year, but this one which I picked up in a charity shop recently was very good.I do love James Blunt, well his music anyway.  I've usually got one of his albums playing in the car and Stevie bought me his new one for Mothers Day.  It's a bit different to his earlier work and it took me a few plays to really get into it but now I love it.  Good job as we are going to see him in November. I took the plunge and re-joined SW, and am loving it at the moment.I managed to find a class that met at 3.45 which fits in better with me, last week was my second weigh-in and I got my 1/2 stone award, Yayyyy!  I was really really happy with that as you can imagine.I bought a 6 week count down and am aiming to loose a stone in those 6 weeks.  I set my overall target to loose 1 1/2 stone, then I'll see how I feel.  Really I just want to be able to fit comfortably in the clothes that are already in my wardrobe.So far so good, I am managing to curb my picking habits, (my biggest downfall)So there you go, some of my favourite things from April, how about you?  What have you enjoyed this past month?Until next time-X-"},
{"title": "Wonderwool Wales, a yarnny adventure", "date": "Sunday 23 April 2017", "text": "I've never been to a yarn festival before, I had planned on going to Yarndale this year with Joanne, (daughter #2) but as she will have a new baby less than a month old by then we will have to give it a miss this time.  We decided instead to go to Wonderwool Wales, which is held at the Royal Welsh Showground in Builth Wells in the beautiful Welsh countryside.  The drive was a bit further than I had anticipated, about 2 hours, but the day was bright and the scenery wonderful so all in all the time driving was pleasant enough.I've heard people say how crowded Yarndale is and to be honest it does put me off a little, after all you go to browse what's on offer and if that's difficult it can be very frustrating.  I'm happy to say that Wonderwool was great in that respect, there were lots and lots of people but there was still plenty of room to walk around and look at the different stands without being jostled around.  When we found a stand that had a crowd we just passed it by and went back later and that worked for us.  There was plenty of food on offer and enough seating too, although as it was such a lovely day quite a few people decided to picnic on the grass.I'm afraid I got a little carried away with my purchases!  although to be honest I could have bought more, I only took a certain about of money with me and stuck to that budget, no debit card spending! The scarf kit caught my eye as soon as we walked in, so I went back for that later in the afternoon, (my motto is always do a reccie first to see what's on offer.  The grey fleck yarn is from Moonlight yarns, (they have an etsy shop although I haven't looked for it yet) and is a sock weight 100% Superwash Merino and is so soft!  I'm thinking a shawl for this one.  The ones in to top photo I just loved the colours.  and the Tek-Tek I bought for a bag project that I have been wanting to do for ages.  As you can see I also bought a selection of hooks, clover are my preferred hook, i've tried others and can't get on with them, and some needles because I haven't got this size.Of course I want to start EVERYTHING NOW! but I do have a couple of things on the go that I need to finish first, I'm being firm with myself, lol.Being about all things wooly and yarny there had to be some sheep.Cute little lambs, look at that face!Some sheep with dreadlocks, lolAnd this one, who was so lovely and friendly, look how she is enjoying that fuss!She also had a lovely face and a beautiful curly fleece and the cutest babies.All in all it was a great day out, I'm glad we made the effort to go.Hope you all had a great weekend too.Until next time-X-"},

{"title": "Weekend break part 2 - Llangollen and the Horseshoe Pass", "date": "Sunday 9 April 2017", "text": "When I was young we visited Wales for holidays quite often and last weekend I was happy to discover that I was only a short drive from somewhere we had driven through and probably stopped off at en route to our holiday destination many times when I was small, Llangollen. Now I must confess that I cannot remember anything about this small town from my childhood except for it's name, but I was very pleasantly surprised.Not only do they have a steam railway it's also famous for it's canal and canal boat holidays.And some seaside treatsI was lucky enough to see some brave souls on the waterPhew, there're through!There is no way you would get me doing anything like that! But I did enjoy taking these photos of them.Next I wanted to drive over somewhere that I do remember very well, the Horseshoe Pass.When I was little I was always amazed by this road and the drops over the side!We would always stop at the top, have a picnic and be excited to see the sheep roaming freely.The day I went there were no sheep but there was still a cafe at the same place and it's still a popular place for biker meet-ups.I found somewhere called the Horseshoe Falls just a couple of minutes walk from Llangollen,such a lovely peaceful place.And I found myself a house, lol.This house has the view of the previous photos, I wouldn't mind sitting out on that deck and enjoying that view, how about you?I retraced my drive back down the Horseshoe Pass and stopped for a coffee and a toasted tea cakeat this Abbey ruin.I definitely don't remember this place from my childhood so I don't suppose we ever stopped here to look around.So that was it, my weekend away over, I headed home after my coffee break and I must say that I felt restored and ready for the week ahead. I'd really like to go here again this year and perhaps have a better look around the town, It's only a 90 minute drive but it's a whole different view.Next time I will have some crafty goodness to show you.Until then, have a great week-X-"},
{"title": "Nimble Thimble stitching meet-up", "date": "Sunday 2 April 2017", "text": "It's that time of year again when a few of us get together at the Nimble Thimble for a day of stitching, chatting and to enjoy the lovely food that Chris puts on for us, in fact I think it's fair to say that we all look forward to the buffet just as much as the day's stitching and stashing.Although the Nimble Thimble is only about an hour away I decided to make a weekend of it this time and booked into a lovely little B&B 20 minutes away in Oswestry on the Friday afternoon.This place looked good on line, but it was such a treat I've already decided that if I stay over again this is where I will stay.My room for the weekendAnd once I'd got my bags in I was bought a lovely cuppa and a home made ginger biscuit.The fridge had complementary treatsAnd breakfast was bought to my room by way of a hamper.This was such a lovely treat! I was even bought a pot of tea as well.  Just look at all the goodies,the granola was homemade and was delicious.So after my lovely breakfast I set off for the Nimble Thimble, the scenery in this part of the country is lovely and I have to make frequent stops just to enjoy it, even in the rain it is stunning, and although the day started and ended rather wet, in between we did have some lovely sunshine.Here we are in the studio above the shop, looking very intent on stitchingThere is Hazel (of the blog Quietly Stitching)  sitting at the back sitting on the left concentrating on her workAnd Michelle, AKA Mouse, (tales of a stitching mouse blog), on the right, showing us her birthday quilt which some bloggers kindly stitched her some pieces for.Pat (no blog) is on the left, she was trying to hide behind the quilt, I think they are laughing because I said something like \"Pat come out from behind the quilt!\"As I said, Chris, (the shop owner) always puts on some lovely food for us, and this time was just as good.We finish the afternoon off with more cake which we are usually too full to eat so we take it home to enjoy later.In between stitching, chatting and eating we all visited the shop downstairs to put by our purchases to pay for later, I was very good and only bought 3 charts :-)  To be honest I didn't intend to buy any because I haven't stitched the ones I bought on our last trip in November, but when you are in the shop it is very hard not to give in to temptation!  After a lovely day that went by far too quickly we all set off on our various journeys home, or in my case to my little B&B, because my weekend treat wasn't over just yet.When I got back Jo, (the B&B owner) had been in and left me a little cupcake, how sweet and such a surprise :-)The little mat under the plate is what I made up on the Friday night.I've wanted to make a Mandala for a while and I saw this little booklet on Amazon last weekI used Rico cotton and chose one of the easier patterns and I'm really pleased with how it came out for a first attempt.Next time I'll show you what new charts I bought and what I did on my Sunday travels.Until then-X-"},

{"title": "Storm Doris and the blanket", "date": "Monday 6 March 2017", "text": "Well February whizzed by pretty quickly didn't it, and here we are 6 days into March already.  I feel like I've been doing plenty but at the same time not achieving a lot, if that makes sense.I'm working on trying to get this blanket done for Mother's Day.I bought the yarn a while ago on a trip to Hobby Craft and i did start this blanket almost straight away and then thought that although I really love the colours they don't really 'go' anywhere in our house, so put it to one side.  Then I thought seeing as i'd already worked quite a bit on it I would carry on and it could be a picnic blanket.  But then it changed its purpose once again when my daughter, Joanne was visiting my mum and she said to her that she wished I would make her a lap blanket for when she is sitting at night.I immediately thought, yes, a home for the blanket, Mothers Day present sorted :-)I've been working on it almost every night for an hour or so, any longer and my hands ache because of the large hook, and being chunky, it's growing quite nicely though, and all being well it should be finished and ready to give mum on March 26th.I love how the colours look with the V stitch.Storm Doris swept into Midlands couple of weeks ago and she took the fence on the left hand side of our garden with her.   Everything from the fence post you can see in the photo,  right to the top of the garden, gone!It's the side that belongs to our neighbour so we won't have to stand the cost, and to be honest the fence wasn't in great condition, he had mentioned last year that he would have to get it replaced.We wanted to dig up that scrap of grass and make the path a little wider this year so i'm sort of hoping that he will leave the fencing a little longer because it will make working that side a little easier.For now we have an open plan garden.Some days have been lovely since, like today, I was able to hang washing on the line this afternoon, and it all but dried too.  Its lovely to see the garden slowly coming to life again.And today's beautiful sunshine bought a little visitor out to sun himself.He sat there for ages enjoying the weather on our neighbours tree. I think he had just spotted the cats in the garden here, he looks like he's peekingI did remember to change my mantle for March and have just gone with a Spring theme as I didn't have anything stitched March related.Still love this little freebie from Snowflower DiariesBut I forgot to show you my monster Amaryllis, it just kept growing and growing.It finally reach 3 feet tall!!It looks rather silly in that small pot lolAnd I ended up having to tie the two stems together for support.It is past it's best now but I think I will try the bulb again next year to see if it will come back, If it does at least i'll be prepared for how big it will be.When I started this post I didn't think I had much to share with you, but it looks like I did after all.Have a good weekUntil next time-X-"},

Dad wasn't perfect by any means, who is, but he loved us and did his best for us, he loved a family get together and would have been so proud to have all the kids together like this and seeing his first granddaughter get married. Mum looks a bit serious here, I wonder if she is thinking that same thing?Until next time-X-"},

I'm not really a party person, well neither of us are and I know we will be looking at each other after a few hours to see if the other is ready to make an exit, lolI'll let you know next time how long we lasted!Until then-X-"},
{"title": "Oh Baby", "date": "Friday 10 February 2017", "text": "As well as the fabulous Christmas present the girls bought us collectively, Joanne and Gavin also had another very special present on Christmas Day, just from them.Here is the obligatory scan photo, but as with most scan photos you can't really make anything out.Her first scan was today and we are all very excited about his, or her arrival on or around August 27th!They have been trying since they got married almost 2 years ago so it was a very special announcement and I don't think Joanne could quite believe it until today's scan.  I've been bursting to tell since they announced it on Christmas Day, and now I can, and I have, lol.Nanny has already started knitting and squirrelling things away, (because that's what we do!), and I just can't resist all the cute baby things when I go shopping :-)I haven't seen the scan photo in person yet because i've been laid up with flu like symptoms for the past 2 days,  I know it wasn't proper flu of course but it was bad enough to keep me in bed for all of yesterday and most of today, and i'm not one for lying around.  I didn't want Joanne coming up and risk catching what I had so i'll have to wait until i'm feeling better.Any other news just feels a bit unnecessary after that announcement  doesn't it so i'll just say that at the beginning of the new month I changed my mantle decorations..  If you were reading my blog this time last year you will notice that they are exactly the same bits and bobs now as then.I shall also be looking forward to opening my Valentine exchanges on Tuesday, I posted mine out in plenty of time so hopefully they have arrived safe and sound.  My Needlecraft Haven exchange parcel arrived sometime last week and my Send a Little Love exchange arrived this morning. so I will be able to share sent and received next time.We've started the ball rolling with getting a new kitchen, and this weekend have to go and make final choices for handles and some other bits and pieces, the new window and door are being fitted on Monday.  I'm both looking forward and also dreading it at the same time.  If it was as straight forward as ripping the old out and putting in new I wouldn't be as bothered but there is a doorway to put in, some pipes to move, a water meter in the wrong place which has to be moved and plastering to be done.  I keep telling myself I survived the bathroom make over, I can survive the kitchen make over, lolUntil next time-X-"},
{"title": "Things that made me smile", "date": "Tuesday 31 January 2017", "text": "One day last week Jo, who blogs at Through The Key Hole wrote a post about her favourite things in January.  I thought it was a great idea, and to round off this first month of 2017 I thought I would share with you some of the things that have made me smile during this dull and dreary January.My AmaryllisHow it looked last MondayAnd now a week later!!Since I posted about this last week it has shot up probably double the height in a week!I love looking every morning to see how much it's grown and it always makes me smile.Not long now to wait for that (hopefully) lovely white flower flower :-)ExchangesI've shied away from exchanges in the past, but I enjoyed gathering all the little presents for the 12 Days of Christmas Swap so much I took the plunge and joined in two Valentine swaps.One of my parcels is already on it's way and the other one is all wrapped and ready to post tomorrow.  :-)ReadingIt was our first Reading Group meeting of the year last Saturday and as well as our group choice we are all taking part in another reading challenge one of the ladies found on line.Our first choice is A Book Chosen by the cover alone.  I spent some time on Amazon just scrolling through books when it was quiet at work one morning and this one caught my eye.How could I not be drawn to this, lolI had absolutely no idea what the story line is, I just went with the cover :-)Saving ChallengesI mentioned the 52 week saving challenge a couple of post ago and I'm happy to say that I have added to my pot every week of January and I am crossing the amounts off  as I feed my Jar :-)I also started a smaller challenge I found on Skint Dad's site, the 365 pennies - Saving Weekly Challenge.  I'm not saving just pennies though, I don't fancy bagging all those up and taking them to the bank at the end of the year!  My 3rd jar is my 'Money I have Left In my Purse on a Thursday Jar' I always used to pay for our food shopping on the debit card but since the beginning of January I've drawn out cash for grocery shopping and I've found that I can keep track of what I'm spending much better, I'm more conscious of what I put in my trolley and  I am spending less money each week.  On Thursday nights I empty my purse (minus the coppers) into the jar.I've had as much as £30 and as little as £5 left  but it's all gone in the jar.I have no plans for the other savings, but this one will go towards any foodie extras at Christmas.It might sound silly, but it's made me feel happy to spend and save actual money rather than use my card.I'm determined to try and keep it up :-)Discovering a new tea, this one i picked up in AldiThe taste is not over powering, Just a hint of coconut, very nice.January has been rather a wet and grey month, but looking back it's nice to see that there have been things worth smiling about.Tomorrows new month means that I get to change my mantle to things of love :-)Until next time-X-"},

{"title": "I want to stitch ALL the things..", "date": "Friday 6 January 2017", "text": "And knit ALL the things and crochet ALL the things!!There are so many beautiful charts and patterns out there, but I have been looking through my stash and come up with some things that I want to stitch this year, I will probably have to buy fabric and thread but I'm going to try and resist the temptation to buy any more charts, don't laugh, i mean it, well for now at least :-)These charts are in my stash and I would like to stitch them this year.In between stitching there has to be some crochet, and I happened across this beautiful blanket on Instagram a few months ago and discovered it was in a back issue of Molly Makes. (photo taken from ravelry)I went in search, as you do, and found the back issue in question on ebay, bought it and then when it arrived realised that I already had it, grrrr, and then I found it on Ravelry, double grrrThat'll teach me!So if anyone should fancy this copy of Molly Makes, Issue No. 24 because they like the look of this blanket or just to browse and get inspiration from all the pretty pictures within it's covers, then please let me know in the comments and it shall be yours.I'll post to wherever. (If more than one person wants it I will draw names, just to make it fair)Anyway, the blanket squares are worked in various shades of Sirdar Crofter and by happy coincidence just after I had bought the magazine I met with some crofter on sale at my local yarn shop, right place, right time, for once :-)  There were 7 balls altogether so obviously there is not enough for the whole blanket but I can add to it as and when, (and if I find it on sale all the better)The knitting that has made it to the list is already a WIP.I can't remember if I've even shown it on here before, but here it is so far.It's the Caramel cardigan, a free pattern off Ravelry.It's worked top down, which was a first for me but not as difficult as I thought it would be.I still like it so I do want to finish it.So those are my crafty goals for now.  Aside from that I've set my reading challenge on Goodreads to 40 books again, I only just managed to achieve that in 2016 but I did have a a good couple of months where I couldn't get into anything.  Hopefully I can avoid that this year.  I've decided I want to read the Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels.  I know there are a lot so i'm going to add one a month to my list, unless of course I completely hate the first one and if that's the case I will just re-think my list :-)I also saw a saving challenge that appealed to me, The 52 Week Money Challenge.The idea is to save £1 in week one, £2 in week two, £3 in week three and so on until in week £52 you will save £52.  By the end of the year you will have saved £1,378.But, I'm not going to do it like that, I'm going to do it in reverse.  For me the summer months and the end of the year seem to be more expensive times of the year so my week started with £52 and will go down £1 each week.  This is just something that I thought I'd challenge myself to do, just to see if I could do it, I've got no plans for the money, as yet anyway.Week 2 has been added to my pot today.I'd love t hear if you have any goals for 2017, craft or not.The first working week of 2017 has been done, and it really wasn't that bad, I'm going to make more of an effort to be positive about it, there are worse jobs, and goodness knows i've done some of them!So I really shouldn't moan.Wishing you all the best for 2017.Until next time-X-"},

My. Goodness!! how cool is that present? I was just speechless what amazing daughters I have.I'm so exited!!  Although we have been to London many times these will all be new experiences for us.That they put so much thought into this gift means such a lot to me.  We don't have to do everything in one visit so we are looking forward to arranging a few trips to the capital during 2017.There was a birthday celebration on the 27th too, Mine!I have now reach the half way point of my 50'sThis time everyone gathered at our house for roast pork and stuffing sandwiches, and of course cake:-)A lovely grey poncho and a crochet blocking board off Joanne and Gavin(I got very excited over that blocking board) :-)The Madame Chantilly chart and the lovely cake forks were from Jenny and James, the jar of squishies were off Oliver, they are mine, and his favourites :-)The lovely flowers were from my friend Lyn along with a bottle of Amaretto, the Scholl pedi and CK makeup bag and Yankee candle off Stevie and the 'Sisters' figurine was off my sister.And Mark gave me an M&S voucher which i'm saving for the for year as i don't really like shopping in the sales.Last but not least, Julie sent me these beautiful knitted gloves.Thank you Julie for thinking of me, I love them :-) I really do feel very spoilt both at Christmas and my Birthday this year and few emotional tears have been shed over the generosity and thoughtfulness behind all my gifts.So that's it for my 2016 blogging, I wonder what 2017 will bring ? I've been planning a little of what I might be doing but it's just in my head at the moment, I think tomorrow i will try and get it down on paper so that I've got something to refer to that will help me keep track, some are craft related some are not.  How about you? are you making list of  crafting goals for next year or making some changes or just challenging yourself ? Whatever you are doing in 2017 I wish you  Health and HappinessUntil Next year-X-"},

We have an early start on Friday morning to get down to St Pancras for 8am but I can't tell you how excited I am!I just hope that this cold that i've picked up has run it's course by Friday otherwise I shall be sporting a very festive, (but rather sore), Rudolph style nose to Germany!Almost forgot to show you the pom pom snowman I made for Oliver, he is so cute I almost had to keep him for myself :-)Well, that's about it for now, hopefully I can manage to take some photos of all the wonderful Christmassy things we are going to see at the weekend, we are back on Monday evening and I have Tuesday off work so I will try and make time to upload photos and blog then.Until next time-X-"},

{"title": "A shawl finish", "date": "Monday 26 September 2016", "text": "Way back at the end of May I shared some photos of a shawl in the making, Antarktis by Janina Kallio, a (paid for) pattern on Ravelry.  I'm afraid I didn't pick it up again after that photo, and when I did I just wasn't happy with the yarn, I thought it might end up a bit scratchy for a shawl, so I ripped it back and started again with this lovely Ginger Twist yarn I bought when I was in Edinburgh earlier in the year.Once I started it turned out to be quite a quick knitAnd although it is probably a tad smaller than the pattern says it should be, I'm quite happy with it :-)Here is a closer look at the eyelet pattern, which looks way more complicated than it actually was.I have been stitching away on Elizabeth too but haven't taken any progress photos, I really am very close to a finish on her though.Autumn came like the flick of a switch on Thursday, I have bought some plants for my kitchen window baskets and was going to put them in after work today but weather is telling me to wait, perhaps tomorrow it will be dry enough for me to do it.My little 99p miniature rose didn't get the message that Autumn had arrived though and is having it's second flush of flowers :-)I've never managed to keep one of these going before, certainly not one that flowered twice!Does anyone know if I can plant this in the garden next year, perhaps in a container if not the ground?  That's all for now, see, I can do short posts sometimes :-)Until next time-X-"},

YayyyyyIt was such a lovely surprise, here's what Jo sentAll my favourite goodies in one box :-)I love the colour of the yarn, more teal than the blue that is showing up in the photo and it is so so soft!  I'm going to have to go in search of another shawl pattern for this one.Jo also sent a lovely card, and I have to tell you Jo that you have the neatest writing :-)And thank you again for the goodies.This week I have another 5 days off work and I wanted to make the most of the nice weather we are still having so today I took myself off to Sudeley Castle in the Cotswolds. I set off at 10.30 after the work and school traffic had all cleared and just an hour later I was in pretty Winchcombe.  I stopped there and sat in the car and ate my breakfast then had a little walk around, there are a few shops but not enough to keep you occupied for more than an hour or so, still, there were some pretty little roads and cottages.Sudeley Castle is less than a mile out of the village, it is such an interesting place absolutely chock full of history, I could easily have spent another few hours there.It is the home of Lord and Lady Ashcombe and is the only privately owned castle to have a queen buried in it's grounds, Katherine Parr, Henry VIII's last wife lived and died there and her tomb is still in St Mary's church in the castle grounds.  Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, Lady Jane Grey and Elizabeth I all visited there. The first thing you walk through before reaching the the castle is The Tithe BarnThen looking over a small pond you see the castleThat pond held my attention for a while because as I walked round I could see some fish coming to the surface.I've no idea what sort of fish they are but they are strange!My next stop was Richard III's Banqueting Hall, no in ruins but so interesting.From here I went into the Knot Garden, created as a reminder of one of her visits, the hedges are clipped into a design which was on one of Elizabeth I dresses.Through the other end is Elizabeth I in her privy chamber, (wonder who thought this one up)I had a little walk around the grounds then before I went inside.Yew trees seem to be a favourite in many of these historic places, I wonder if how we see them now is how they imagined they would be when they were planted.You were allowed to walk in these ones, well, no one stopped me anyway!.......To be continuedUntil then-X-"},

{"title": "Croome Court and Parkland, a National Trust visit", "date": "Tuesday 16 August 2016", "text": "Monday was a beautiful sunny day, it couldn't have been more perfect for our next National Trust adventure.  Croome Court in Worcestershire was the former home of the 6th Earl of Coventry.It sits in Croome Park and the views are just amazing.As you approach you see the \"London Arch\" designed by Robert AdamAfter showing our cards and armed with our little guide it was a lovely gentle walk though a wooded area with plenty of seating along the way to sit, have a rest or just take in the peace of it allThere is the Ice House, nestled among the trees, with its's thatched roof it looks like a little fairy-tale cottageThe first thing you come to as you emerge from the pathway is the Church of St. Mary Magdelene, although now it is redundant.  But what amazed me was the viewThe hills you see on the skyline are the Malvern HillsAnd there is Croome CourtThe Rotunda in the park, designed by Lacelot \"Capability\" BrownIn the grounds is Temple Greenhouse, designed by Robert AdamCroome Court is not like other National Trust properties, there are no great family treasures to see, the house and contents were sold in 1948, although some objects were preserved by the Estate Trust and there are plans for them to be returned to the house and there will be new displays and stores opening in November this year.  You are still able to go into the house but apart from fireplaces and a few ornate ceilings there is not a lot to see.At the moment there is a display of tapestries in the tapestry rooms designed by Grayson Perry, they might not be everyone's cup of tea but they are very colourful and vivid.Not really the sort of art work you would expect in a building like this are they?But, the house and grounds still have a very interesting history.Croome was Capability Brown's very first creation.After the house was sold in 1948 it became a school until 1979 when it was then sold to the Hare Krishna movement and became their international headquarters and re-named Chaitanya College.In 1984 is was sold yet again and remained empty for many years. One proposal was to turn the house into a hotel and the grounds into a golf course, (how tragic would that have been!!)Thankfully the National Trdust were concerned that if this happened Capability Brown's first creation would be lost forever.  Luckily they were able to acquire the parkland in 1997 from the insurance company who owned it, along with a very generous gift.  However, Croome Court was privately owned by a property developer but the Croome Heritage Trust were able to purchase the house in 2007 by way of a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and they now lease it to the National Trust.Part of Croome Park was requisitioned  in 1941 and became RAF Defford.  All that is left standing now is the hospital block (which now is a tea room) but back in 1941 it was virtually a small village, over 2,500 people lived and worked there, it also housed up to 100 aircraft and was home to Wellington Bombers and the Telecommunications  flying unit which carried out top secret trials and radar researchIt's a shame that Croome Court doesn't have the family treasures of other NT places but the interesting history and the fantastic grounds more than make up for the missing furniture and paintings.We are so so lucky to have these historic places, the National Trust and all the volunteers do a fantastic job of preserving our heritage so that we can enjoy them today, I for one am grateful for that.Tomorrow we are having a day at home relaxing, on Wednesday we are going to Winsdor Castle then travelling to Sailsbury and staying over-night and on Thursday we are at Stonehenge :-)Until next time-X-"},
{"title": "So what was I excited about going to on Friday?", "date": "Saturday 13 August 2016", "text": "Ever since I read The Other Boleyn Girl I have been obsessed with the Tudors, this was the book that got me interested in finding out more, and the more I found out the more fascinated I became with Tudor and Plantagenet history, and I devoured all of Philippa Gregory's books.I had always liked History at school so it wasn't a new interest for me, but I can't honestly remember the lessons going beyond the fact that Henry VIII had six wives and that little rhyme to help remember their fate, you know the one, survived beheaded died, survived beheaded alive, the lessons were certainly nothing like these books!  When it popped up on my FB feed a couple of weeks ago that Philippa Gregory was doing a small UK book tour for her new novel, Three Sisters Three Queeens, and that she was going to be in Birmingham, well it was a no-brainer, I HAD to go!She was very interesting, and the passion she has for these Tudor women was very obvious, at one point she remarked that she could feel herself beginning to rant, lolShe talked about how there is very little in the archives of the lives of these Tudor women, how they lived, their marriages, what they thought, It was a time dominated by men.  She researches what she can of them and then the stories come from her imagination, obviously there are the basic facts of history there, but what they thought, how they acted is what she imagines.How wonderful to have such imagination and creativityShe talked for around an hour then invited questions.Someone asked,  \"have you had any thoughts as to who your next book will be about\"The answer was Yes! Jane Grey..... a collective Oooooh went around the room.I will eagerly await that one :-)Surprisingly the hall was not full, I can't think why as other venues were sold out.We did get a seat at the front because of that, although as you can see it was probablynot the best place to sit, but at least we could hear. Afterwards she was signing books, so now I have my own autographed copy :-)************Both me and Mark have a week off work next week, we have a few days out planned, a couple of NT places and hopefully a trip to Windsor Palace.  That one has been on my list for so long that we really need to make the time for it this week.Until next time-X-"},

{"title": "Ha! so much for keeping up with bloging - Photos of Spinalonga anyone?", "date": "Friday 15 July 2016", "text": "I was full of good intentions to post holiday pictures, i even started a blog post, well several posts actually.   OK, i started 4 blog posts.  But then i'd get half way through and think,  nah, who will want to be bothered looking at my holiday snaps, lets face it they mean absolutely nothing to anyone except me, and perhaps someone else who has been to that place and maybe someone like me who just LOVES looking at other folks holiday snaps ;-)So here they are,  Elounda, Crete 2016First let me say it was hot, very hot.The hotel was lovely, clean, plenty of space, lovely food, great location and the best Greek themed night we have ever been too.  But, i think i'm done with all inclusive holidays, not only that but i think i'm done with these sort of holidays, well for anything longer than i week anyway.  No doubt we will still have to holiday in the sun though, seeing as my husband is \"of Mediterranean descent\"  or at least that's what he keeps telling me.  He's not, he was born and bred in the Black Country.Two of the nicest days we had there were spent sight seeing.This is the Island of Spinalonga, a 20 minute boat trip from Elounda and 7 minutes from Plaka. The island you can see behind Spinalonga is called Kolokitha and is now uninhabited but was formerly a peninsula and on that island was an ancient city, Olous.This whole city was sunk underwater, no one knows why, but supposedly when the weather is good and the sea is quiet you can make out some of the walls and buildings of this sunken city.Long ago Kolokitha was connected to ancient Elounda by a narrow strip of land, now it is an independent island.This island protected the entrance to the gulf from winds and the sea and also from attacks because there was only one way in, past SpinalongaThese islands have so much history attached to them, they really are fascinating.The Vanetian's occupied Crete in 1210 and you can still see evidence of the forts they built today. If you have read The Island by Victoria Hislop you will know about Spinalonga's other history as a leper colony, of course, that is the main reason people want to visit this island. Coming in on the boat  Mark tried to tell me that we should walk the other way, but he hadn't read the book,  I remember how she described walking through the tunnel.  (Don't you just love it when you're right, lol)There is no guided tour around the island, (no audio either) but we bought a guide book from a local shop, it was written as a guided walking tour so as you were walking the island you could refer to the book and know what you were looking at. What they don't tell you when you buy your boat ticket and then your admission ticket is that there is very little left of the buildings from it's time as a leper colony, most of them were demolished in the 1970's.  I suppose there was still a stigma attached, and after a cure was found and everyone left, (the last person left in 1957), no one imagined that years later it would become a tourist attraction.If you wanted to visit the island in the 1980's you would have had to ask a fisherman to take you over in his boat and would have had the island to yourself, more of less.  How things change in such a short time.So here we are the other side of the tunnel.There's Mark with his hands on his hips doing the 'hurry up and take your photos' pose.And through the arch to a sort of little street where there would have been shops.Now behind those shuttered doors there are finds and stories of the island's history.These two blocks were build for the lepers and are the only building left standing from that time That bloke got in the photo again, lolPart of the cemeteryOur second trip out was on the Happy Train :-)(It really is called The Happy Train, there is one called The Little Blue Train too)We both enjoyed this so much, well worth the money.Our trip was for around 3 and a half hours up into the mountains stopping at Plaka, a Monastery that has been there since about 14 something or other and has the grave of two very young brave Greek soldiers who held off German fighters so that people could escape, our guide told the stories so well and were clearly very proud of there country.  We also stopped for a walk through a village that has just 12 people living there, imagine that!apparently they all meet in the village hall to watch TV :-)MonseteryWe saw remains of windmills, and were allowed encouraged to go inside them.  No Risk Assessment, no hard hats, i mean, really, those stones could come down anytime, it didn't stop us.  Health & Safety would have a fit here, they would have had them barriered off years ago, you wouldn't be able to get within a hundred yards of them, lolWith the original workings still there inside the tumble down buildingThere are lots of these dotted around the island.Amazing really that hundreds of years these are still standing.In Plaka we saw a blue shop selling all things blueA great view of SpinalongaThat nights menu choiceand close upEver wondered how you get sundried peppers?Simple, hang them on the fence outside your house to dry in the sun :-)and we saw the most spectacular viewsIf you made it this far, thank you, your're a star :-)I'll leave it there for now, otherwise this will be in the running for the longest blog post award!Perhaps next time i'll show you a little of the hotel,Take care-X-"},

{"title": "Choosing my holiday reading", "date": "Thursday 9 June 2016", "text": "We are going on holiday on Tuesday so this week i have been choosing what i would like to read while we are away.Top of my list is the new Angela Marsons book.  I bought this as an e-book as soon as it came out but I have been saving it until now.  Her books are now available in paperback and although i have them on my kindle i will buy them in paper form at some point because they are something i would like to have on my shelf, (to just you know, look at, stroke and smell, Judy, you will totally understand this, right :-)The following 3 I also have on my KindleThis last one was coming up quite expensive for a Kindle download, don't you find that sometimes?I have no qualms about paying for a paperback or hardback but when it comes to paying more than a couple of pounds for an e-book I am very reluctant, probably something to with it not feeling like a real book I suppose, anyway, luckily I managed to get a copy of My Real Children from the library.Chris at alwayssmiling recently recommended this book on her blog and I thought It sounded good so I'm looking forward to this one.If you have read any of the above do let me know what you thought, or if you have any book recommendations, I've fallen into a bit of a reading slump, I'm finding it hard to get into anything at the moment, I'm hoping that a nice relaxing holiday will get me going again.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Thank you to Angela who accepted the Liebster award from my last post.  I will be looking forward to reading your answers on your next blog post Angela :-)I will blog again before we fly off on Tuesday because I almost have something to show you, and it WILL be finished because I want to take it away with me :-)Till then-X-"},
{"title": "Adventures in knitting, podcasts and an award", "date": "Sunday 29 May 2016", "text": "I have knit on and off since my girls were small, usually cardigans or jumpers for them, then again when Oliver was born, nothing complicated, just little cardigans and blankets.I do enjoy knitting, it's easily picked up if you have just a bit of spare time or watching the TV, and I like that you don't have to get out all the paraphernalia associated with stitching.So when I  discovered that there were knitting podcasts it sparked my interest in knitting again.The first one I watched was The Sampler Girl, which I really enjoyed, especially the ones she does with her mum, they have me chuckling away at their banter.  Then there is Nicole's, at Nicole's Needlework.You probably remember her lovely sampler stitching, more recently she has been knitting.  Anyway both Tanya and Nicole have knit lovely shawls which lead me to browse Ravelry in search of a pattern.I started small and simple with the Hitchhiker, and love how it turned out.You start off with one or two stitches and by the process of increases and decreases end up with this asymmetrical shape, very clever :-)I never thought of myself as a shawl wearer, but these are probably more like neck scarves, which I do like.I enjoyed knitting the Hitchhiker so much I cast on another one right away.This is Antarkis,which is a paid for pattern on Ravelry and I'm using one of the yarns I bought in Edinburgh recently, the West Yorkshire Spinners Blue Faced Leicesterand my progressI did order another circular needle to continue this on but when it arrived today I had ordered the wrong size.There is another podcast I've been addicted to watching, Danni at Little Bobbins  knits She is a serious knitter and yarn stasher and she knits the loveliest socks that It got me back to thinking how much I really want to knit a pair of socks.Now, I did attempt a sock about 2 years ago and I really really struggled with 4 needles and gave up before I was even half way done, that project is stuffed in a drawer somewhere and hasn't seen the light of day since.  But, when I was googling easy sock patterns this week I came across  a blog with  this basic sock pattern, and best of all it goes thorough the process step by step and mentioned using a small circular needle, which I had never thought of!I'm so excited about the fact that I might now be able to knit some socks :-) I ordered a circular needle and I have some yarn which was in a sock kit I bought years ago, it's probably not the best yarn in the world and isn't a very exciting colour way  but it will serve the purpose for my first attempt.I've been spending lots of time in the garden trying to move some plants and split some that have got a bit big, still a few jobs to do but it's looking ok.I'm particularly impressed with my Hostas this year.  I put some copper band around the tubs and it seems to have worked in keeping away the slugs and snails,  there is only damage to one leaf  in each tub, and the culprit was found, (and removed) when I put the band on, so that was worth doing :-)There are two hostas planted in the garden which I want to dig out next year and put in large tubs, I think you can appreciate them more planted in containers.Sorry there is no stitching update, I have done a little on Elizabeth but really it's so little it's not worth sharing this time.I have also fallen behind on the mantle decorating :-(  I really wanted to keep up with this but with so many other things going on it's not been high on my list of things to do.  The only thing I did was finish my Maybelle flowers into a garland and hung that.  I'm really pleased with how these flowers came out.I think I'm still behind in blog reading so apologies if I haven't visited you for a while, I will catch up, eventually.Finally, back at the beginning of May Jo, at jo-throughthekeyhole.blogspot.co.uk/ nominated me for the Liebster Award, thank you so much

which was being broadcast live from London2.  where would be your ideal place to live, town, country or coast?I love English seaside towns and I've always had a dream of living by the sea, that would be my ideal location, a little place with uninterrupted views of the sea.3.  Do you have any pets?Yes, 2 cats Millie and Molly.  Millie is all black and short haired and an old lady of  11, Molly is

book, earl grey tea, and my face cream.If you asked me again another time it would most likley be 3 different things, lol7.  If you were given a million pounds, what you spend it on?You know, I don't think I would rush out to buy anything in particular.  I would give some to my girls first, the rest would probably be put into savings, quite boring really!8.  What would be your last meal?This is not really a meal as such but something I really enjoy (occasionally), sausage, 4 sausages, really really well done, (for 'well done' read burnt) and a good dollop of tomato ketchup to dip them in :-)9.  Have you ever met anyone famous?Mmmm, not unless you count the Bachelors when I was probably about 8 or 9.They were in a pantomime that my granny had taken me to and I remember going to get their autograph after the show10.  What's your favourite take away?Without a doubt Indian.  I usually go for salmon tika with sagg aloo and salad or chiken rogan josh and boiled rice.  I gave up having nann bread years ago but love poppadoms and dips.Great questions Jo thank you!Now here are my 10 questions:-1.  What was the last book you read?2.  Apart from family, if you could choose 3

or hate them?10.  Now, look out your window, what do you see?This is where I should nominate 5 other bloggers to take part, but as it's been quite a few weeks and i'm not up to date with blog reading what I want to do is nominate YOU. If you are reading this, (and thank you for getting this far on a long post), and you have a blog I would love it if you would take part, I think it would be a great way to discover new blogs;-).All you need to do is copy all the info regarding the conditions etc together with the questions I askedand answer them on your blog then create  more questions, simple!Leave me a comment if you decided to take part (and I hope you do) and I can come and visit you :-)We have a lovely long Bank Holiday weekend her in the UK and so far the weather has been just lovely, fingers crossed it stays that way :-)  Were not going far from home tomorrow though, I'm not keen on sitting in Bank Holiday traffic, but we did think that we would go our for breakfast in the morning then come back and have a nice chill out day and perhaps watch some films, we don't do that very often so it will be a nice change.I do hope some of you will take up the offer of the Liebster award.Thank you for visiting today, I really appreciate it, see you soon.-X-"},
{"title": "One Saturday in Edinburgh", "date": "Thursday 19 May 2016", "text": "I had to bid a fond farewell to my old laptop, it served me well for probably 8 years or more, nothing could be done to save it, but at least the I.T guy managed to get all my files and photos off the hard drive.  It's going to be a task to go through everything and see what i really do want to keep though, something i will have to do a bit at a time.It seems ages since I was here but I thought i'd pick up where I left off, which was when I was just before I set off to Berwick again.We have had some really lovely weather the last few weeks and when I set off for my visit to Mark we had been having temperatures of 22 - 24 degrees most days.  I got a shock when he picked me up at the station on the Friday evening, it was only 12 degrees!!The following day Mark dropped me at the train station just before 8.30 for my train to Edinburgh, it was like a bleak Winter morning, really cold and misty.Berwick Upon Tweed station. (If you are wondering,this is how you pronounce Berwick)I know some of  our place names can be a little strange and not pronounced how you might think,the universal English language can be confusing.Anyway, 40 minutes later i was in Edinburgh, where it was clearer but colder still.Honestly, i couldn't have chosen a colder day if i had gone mid Winter.My daughter text me to say it was a lovely 24 degrees at home, and there i was considering buying an extra jumper and a pair of gloves, lolI decided to buy a tour bus ticket, one of those you can hop on and off all day, Edinburgh is very hilly so it gave me chance to rest when I'd had enough of walking.I didn't have time to visit all the places I would have liked, and chose to visit Holyrood House rather than the Castle.  Unfortunately you're not allowed to take photographs inside the Palace.  Twice a year the Queen still stays there, it's shut at those times, but when it's open for visitors some of the rooms on the tour are actually used by the Queen.  It's quite strange walking round and thinking that Her Majesty has walked where you are walking. and sat at that dining table :-)Holyrood is also where Mary Queen of Scotts lived and you can see her rooms in the Palace, and very cold they are too, imagine what they would have been like back then in the middle of Winter!The Abbey ruins and the gardens are well worth a walk around too.Edinburgh is also home to the largest monument to a writer.Normally you would be able to climb to the top of the Walter Scott monument but at this time is was closed for refurbishment, which was probably just as well because i wouldn't have been able to resist the challenge of climbing the 287 steps just to say I'd done it, but my legs and feet would not have thanked me, lolWalter ScottThe Walter Scott Monument built in 1884There are plenty of shops selling tartan paraphernalia and shortbread biscuits in various shapes and in every conceivable shaped tin, of course, there would be, and why not, but there is also a lot of history attached to the City, and that's what I'm more interested in, which was why the tour bus is a good idea, the guides are very informative and you get little snippets about the City that you would probably miss otherwise.I managed to fit in a mini yarn crawl while I was there.  Ginger Twist is a cute little shop about 10-15 minute walk from Hollyrood House and where I purchased some goodiesAnd later in the afternoon I managed to find Kathy's Knits, another lovely place and another purchaseThis is the first time i've ever bought any hand dyed yarn, and i'm loving the colours and have been spending quite a bit of time on Ravelry looking for something to knit.My train back to Berwick was at 5.30,  I'd walked almost none stop all day, only stopping for breakfast and a cuppa late morning and another coffee stop while waiting for my train, needless to say, I was shattered.Mark said the mist from the morning had hung around Berwick all dayI was heading home and another long train journey the next afternoon, so although it was lovely to get away, see Mark and do some sight seeing it was a tiring weekend, plus I had Oliver 3 times as well as work last week so I feel like i'm playing catch-up with everything this week.Hopefully I will get around to some blog reading and commenting at the weekend now I've got my new super duper computer :-)-X-"},

{"title": "Berwick Upon Tweed", "date": "Saturday 9 April 2016", "text": "So after the excitement of Liverpool we were bound for Northumberland.  Mark has been working near Berwick for a few months now but this is the first time that i have been able to take time off  work to stay with him. I was left to occupy myself during the day while he was at work, that's ok, i don't mind wondering around with my camera :-) The river Tweed, looking towards Berwick town, the clock tower is the Town Hall,What strikes you when you first arrive are the 3 bridges across the river.And you get a good view of all three together from the road towards Spittal.In the foreground Berwick Bridge, or the Old Bridge as it is known as.  It was built between 1611 and 1624 and is Grade I listed, traffic on this bridge is one way from the town.  The middle one is the Royal Tweed Bridge a concrete construction which was built between 1925 and 1928 and is a traffic bridge.The third bridge is the Royal Boarder Bridge, and is a Grade I listed railway viaduct, built between 1847 and 1850 and designed by Robert Stevenson (of The Stevenson's Rocket fame).  I must admit that i have a bit of a weakness for bridges, and never got tired of this view.  ~~~~~~~~~~Berwick is home to the oldest known Barrack buildings.  I didn't visit the Barracks themselves but did spend many hours walking the Ramparts following the Lowery Trail, (which goes for miles).  Apparently LS Lowery spent quite a bit of time in Berwick and a lot of his paintings show scenes he sketched whilst visiting the area.There is a lighthouse, a small one admittedlyComing down from the ramparts there are several ways to access the estuary and the sea.These lovely houses have a perfect spotWhen i was walking into the town across the old bridge on the Monday i spotted something in the water.  Can you see that little black dot in the middle of the river?I was so excited when i discovered that the black dot was a seal enjoying a bit of sun :-)  There must be a bit of a sandbank where he is.  I saw him again, in the same spot on Thursday.I walked down to Spittal one day, just about a mile away, lovely quiet place.  Not a town as such, there are no shops except for a local general store.But there is a rather lovely beach.It was very windy the day i went, but in the summer i bet it's heaving, unlike now when there were only walkers like me or with their dogs enjoying the peace and quiet. I fell in love with these houses on the frontHow lovely it must be to wake up, open your bedroom curtains and see the sea every morning!Local sea rescueI took the river walk one day to get a better look at the Stevenson bridgeThe 3 bridges from the other directionI took a few photos in black & white, i think this one looks better in B&WBerwick had a castle, you can just see the remains at the far endI walked right round to that little cottage you can see in the distance to the rightIt was a holiday let, so the notice in the window said.  Wonder how you would get yourself and your luggage to it? I retraced my steps, walked up through a little park, which was once a spot for local hangings and found myself at the top end of the town centre.There is a caravan park here overlooking the sea and a small beachLoved the view from high upA lonely SandpiperSome people were enjoying exploring the rock poolsAnd who could blame them with such interesting things to find :-)While walking down by the lighthouse one day i could here a lot of birds singing, then i noticed that someone had put up lots of bird boxes in the trees.I noticed this little fella first, singing his little heart out he wasAnother one keeping watchSome activity at one of the bird boxesI was glad to be able to get this photoSome rather loud chirping got my attention and i looked up to see this little guy on some cableLooks like he was wondering what i was doing 'down there', lolNow, i'm no good with bird species, except for the obvious, so if anyone knows what these are i would very much like you to let me know in the comments.I really enjoyed my week away, i managed to do loads of walking, something which i really enjoy but never seem to have the time to do very often, plus the walks i took were much more interesting than around housing estates!Thank you for indulging me in posting my pictures, i realise that looking through other peoples holiday snaps is not something that a lot of people like to do, (although i will admit that i am from a strange breed that love to look at other peoples photos, lol)Normal blog service will resume next week with some stitching and crochet updates :-)-X-"},
{"title": "The Fab 4 Liverpool weekend", "date": "Monday 4 April 2016", "text": "We had a 2 part break, starting with the Easter weekend in Liverpool, I've wanted to do this for a while, and now I have! We hit some bad traffic on the way down so didn't arrive until just after lunch time, the traffic queuing for the City Centre car park was horrendous, at one point it seemed as if we would never get a parking space, but eventually we did although understandably we were both a bit frazzled by then.We were stopping at the Hard Days Night hotel which was thankfully only a short walk from the Liverpool 1 parking, check-in wasn't until 2pm but we were able to drop our bags before then.The Hard Days Night Hotel, in what was the financial district of the city.Statues of the Beatles are all around, I think this one is Paul?As you might guess from the name it's a Beatles themed hotel, we were in the Cynthia room.The whole hotel is decorated with some fantastic Beatles photos.We had tickets for the Beatles Story on the Albert Dock on the day we arrived so we headed straight over there.  It was a glorious day and the dock was crowded with people enjoying the weather.Below:  How the Cavern Club used to look, so much smaller than you would have imagined.  They didn't serve alcohol, so people (and the bands) used to go and get a drink from the pub over the road.I loved all the Lennon photos, (can you tell he's my favourite)~~~~~~~~~~The Wall of Fame is on Mathew Street.Hundreds of bricks inscribed with the names of bands that have played at the original Cavern Club from 1957 to 1973.Here's a bit of useless information, but you never know, it might come up in a quiz some time....Liverpool has had more No. 1 singles than any other city in Britain, 54 since 1952, wow! there must be something in the water there!~~~~~~~~~~Albert DockThis was once a working dock of course, I think it's great that they have made it into something that people can come and enjoy, there are many shops and eateries as well as a couple of museums.  We visited the Maritime museum, well worth a visit with interesting stories, there is a section about the Lusitania and another about the Titanic, both of which we really enjoyed, although very sad.There is a complete passenger list for the Titanic of all the classes and besides each name it says survived or died,  it's very emotional reading those names and very noticeable that in first class hardly any of the men survived at all, then there are the whole families that died, so so sad.Albert DockLoved the mix of old and new and the interesting angles on the buildingsSeen from the dockI think this skipper might have been taking a nap while waiting for customers :-)This building is opposite the Albert Dock, it does a good impression of a ship, don't you think?~~~~~~~~~~The Three Graces...The Liver Building, (left) the Cunard Building (middle) and the Port of Liverpool Building (right) at Pier Head.  The clock faces on the Liver Building are 25 feet in diameter, bigger than those on Big Ben, who knew!You can read more about the Liver Building and the other 2 buildings HERE, there are some very interesting stories about the Liver Birds.~~~~~~~~~~On the Friday night, (Good Friday) we had tickets for the Cavern Club to see a Who tribute band.I was so excited to be going to the Cavern Club!!, although not the original one of course, (that's no longer there), but the atmosphere was fantastic all the same, we haven't been to see a live band in a while and I'd forgotten how good it is. I didn't take any photos in there, but take it from me the atmosphere is great!~~~~~~~~~~ Easter Saturday we had a booked a tour of John and Paul's childhood homes.The National Trust own these two houses, you can't just turn up and go inside, bookings are via the National Trust and there are mini bus pick-ups at a couple of locations.  They run about 4 trips per day with a maximum of 15 people on each tour, which is just about the right size group.  We are National Trust members so we got a big discount on the ticket price.Unfortunately photography is not allowed in either of the houses, but they are both decorated as they would have been when both John and Paul lived there, complete with yellow formica worktops in the kitchen (John's house) and candlewick bedspreads in both :-)Mendips, the home of John Lennon's aunt and uncle with whom he lived from when he was 5.When this house came up for sale Yoko Ono bought it and gave it to the National Trust with a stipulation that it was to be decorated in the style it would have been when he was growing up.  They were able to recreate the inside from photos and from accounts of the students that his aunt took in as lodgers.The house sits on a now quite busy road, which wouldn't have been so busy in Johns youth.Paul's house is not far away, but sits on a council estate.No. 20 Forthlin Road.Again they have recreated the inside as it would have looked when Paul was growing up.  The windows were what would have been in place at the time, they were acquired from a house opposite when the owners where changing their windows.  The off white paintwork is the right colour for the time as is the 'council red' I really didn't know what to expect from this tour but we agreed that it was way better than we thought it would be, you got a real feel for them growing up there and what an exciting time it must have been, and a sense of how ordinary they were.  Well worth the money if you are thinking of visiting.~~~~~~~~~~Weather wise, Saturday was a complete wash-out from around lunchtime onwards, we walked back towards Albert Dock after the tour as our Beatles Story ticket included entrance to another part on the Pier Head.If you do  go to this part don't bother going to the little animated film they show, total waste of time with no significance.  But it did pass a bit of time as the weather was so bad.    ~~~~~~~~~~I would have liked to had a ferry across the Mersey but there was no way I was venturing out on the water, the rain was lashing down by this time and it was hard to walk in the wind, such a contrast to the day before.There was so much to see that we couldn't manage it all in the couple days we were there but it's only about a 2 hour drive so I would definitely love to go again.~~~~~~~~~~On Easter Sunday after a late breakfast we started out on our second journey.  Mark would be at work but I had a leisurely week planned.I'll tell you all about that later in the week :-)-X-"},
{"title": "A Christmas finish and a stitchy start", "date": "Wednesday 23 March 2016", "text": "I don't know what happened to March, I blinked and we are almost at the end, how did that happen.It's been funny old month, i can't seem to get going with anything, and if i start anything i seem to create more mess than there was before. We are going for a weekend break to Liverpool on Friday and then on Sunday we are continuing up to Berwick for the rest of the week and as typically happens in the week leading up to a holiday, i decide to add an epic cleaning list to an already filled week.  Why on earth i feel that i must have a deep clean of everything in sight is beyond me, but i do it to myself every time.I need 3 weeks holiday, one week before, to prepare, one week away and a week to recover and get back to normal, lol.I am looking forward to a week away though, and Liverpool in particular, i have lots of Beatles related things for us to do there :-)Not a lot of crafting to show for this month, although I did stitch and finish this little Pineberry Lane Santa.  I've had it in my 'to do' pile for ages and when Christine put it up for the Needlecraft Haven monthly ornament it reminded me.  Although i didn't meet the NH stitching deadline, (i'm not good at stitching to a time limit), i have finished one of my intended charts.(Apologies for the terrible photos, they were taken on my phone at night too, not a good combination)  I think he is a rather cute Santa.  I noticed that a lot of people chose to leave the year off this one, although i did consider it i stitched it as charted in the end.The fabric i used had already been tea-dyed at sometime so i didn't bother ageing it anymore. Like many of you i probably spend far too much time looking at the work of other people and new things that i would like to do and not enough time getting on with it.  This year i have tried to put that right and have done more stitching in the last few months than i think i did for the whole of last year,they might only be small finishes but i think I've got my act together enough to be trusted with a larger project now.I stitched Molly, one of the Carriage House girls years ago, must be 4 at least, (i'm too lazy to look back and see!), but it was a while ago.Yet more terrible grainy photos...sorryI always intended to stitch the others but kept putting it off, until now.This is Elizabeth after 18 days.I like stitching blocks of colour, (must be the OCD gene in me), so i'm not fed up, although i will be giving her a holiday next week and taking something else away with me. I don't know how much i'll be on line next week, i shall probably only have internet access on my phone and will have to catch up on blogs and commenting when i get back.  Wishing you all a 'hoppy' Easter and I will catch up when i get back from my jollys and bore you all with (better) photos of my time away and hopefully some new stitching too :-)-X-"},
{"title": "Mother's day", "date": "Monday 7 March 2016", "text": "Yesterday was Mother's Day here in the UK. I always thought that Mothering Sunday and Mother's day were one and the same, apparently not.Mothering Sunday has it's roots in Christianity and was a celebration of the mother church, people returned to their so called mother church, the church in their area, for a service.Years later it became a day when servants were given time off to visit families, children would pick wild flowers to give their mothers.Mother's day as we celebrate it now began in Grafton, West Virginia, in 1908, when Anna Jarvis held a memorial for her mother.  Later, Anna didn't like the commercialisation of Mother's Day and particularly didn't like the use of printed greetings cards.I wonder what she would think of all the shops filled with cards and Mother's Day related items if she could see them now!Still, after saying all that, my girls, (and Oliver) did spoil me yesterday with their lovely gifts of flowers, pandora charm, chocolates, a cute little monkey and cup (from Oliver) and some hand made presents too.I have to show you a closer photo of what my middle daughter Joanne made me, she did a great job.A sweetie tree of my favourites :-)I almost don't want to dismantle it!A letter 'M' to add to my collectionHome made carrot cake, she knows how mum likes cake!I hope you were equally spoilt if you celebrated other's Day yesterday.~~~~~~~~~~I'll be back very soon with some Christmas stitching and a new start.-X-"},
{"title": "White rabbits, white rabbits, white rabbits (and a March mantle)", "date": "Tuesday 1 March 2016", "text": "Did you remember this morning?There are variations on this superstition, saying it once, twice, or three times and even one that says it must be 'White Rabbit'...but you must also say 'Brown Rabbit' at night and walk downstairs backwards, (?)Whatever you do, (or don't) say on the 1st of the month i hope March will be a lucky one for you.And, if mine is as productive as February, I will indeed be a happy bunny :-)I changed my mantle last night before i went to bed because i've got a lot on today.  I enjoyed looking around to see what i could use.Easter is in March this year so there are lots of Easter decorations in the shops, but i didn't particularly want to be stuck with Easter for the next 3 weeks, (it will come soon enough), so a Spring theme seemed a better option.I will probably change / add a couple of things for the Easter week when the time comes.~~~~~~~~~~As for stitching, i've stitched and made up the two little Spring freebies you can see on the mantle.Tulips & BunnyFree pattern from The Snowflower Diaries Which you can find hereMy own choice of threads and fabricA closer lookAnd below is:Happy SpringFree pattern from The Snowflower DiariesWhich you can find hereI stitched this with the recommended threads Just a simple hoop finish again, I wrapped some fabric around the hoop this timeI have to say that these two were an absolute pleasure to stitch.Although not what i would usually choose to do, i did enjoy every stitch and working with the lovely bright colours.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Did you notice my little friend?I just couldn't resist her when I saw her, and I knew then that the theme for March just had to be bunnies :-)Look at that sweet little knitted cardigan!Mark of course, thinks i'm slightly mad,(that's nothing new, I'm used to people thinking i'm strange ;-) Luckily i can get away with adding my touches around the house, he just says 'very nice' and occasionally rolls his eyes :-)~~~~~~~~~~Millie is doing just fine, thank you all for you comments last time.She is eating much better and had actually put on some weight when i took her back for her final check-up last Tuesday, which is great! Fingers crossed for healthy, happy cats, (and bank account!).Until next time-X-"},
{"title": "A mostly expensive start to the year so far", "date": "Wednesday 17 February 2016", "text": "On Friday Millie was booked in at the vets to have dental work done.We knew she had a build up of plaque and, for a while she has had very smelly breath.but lately she has not been eating much, and although she has never been a fat cat she was starting to look a bit too thin.  At almost 12 years old, she is getting to be an old lady, but apart from her teeth her pre-op check showed that she is in good health otherwise, thank goodness.So I dropped her off at 8.30 am on Friday and at around 1 pm they phoned to say that she was all done.  Unfortunately they had to take the majority of her teeth out, 13 in total, she is just left with a couple at the front now.  Plus to get one of her teeth out they had to cut her gum, so she has a few stitches too.  She was not very happy with me on Friday I can tell you!  I expected her to be off her food for a few days, or at least not to eat much, but no, I opened a tin of pilchards for her, mashed them up and she was right in there, finishing off most of the tin!  Happily she is now more or less back to her normal self, her face was a little bit swollen but that is mostly gone down now and she is eating more than she has done in months!  She has pain killers once a day and has to go back in 10 days for another check-up, but hopefully we should see a big improvement in her eating and weight gain now.Of course those of you with pets will know that vet visits don't come cheap and this little visit lightened our bank balance by £318. What with Molly's abscess just after Christmas we have forked out almost £1000 so far this year in vet bills, and we are only in month 2!  We have no pet insurance, (I know, I know, not very insightful of me), but as they are getting to be quite 'old ladies' now  the insurance would probably be quite high and of course wouldn't cover what they have already been treated for, so, I have decided that every month I will put a little money away to cover any future vet bills.  Touch wood, my two cats have always been quite healthy and well, they don't wander out of our garden and they are not hunters, and I think that helps, but there is no getting away from the fact that they are getting older and may need other treatment in the future, at least if I start a fund now at least I will know that some, if not all of the money will be covered.~~~~~~~~~~I'm still plugging away with the February instalment of the Joyful World SAL.I have to say that although I love this, I'm not enjoying stitching it, does that make sense?  Plus, I've miscounted somewhere, so there will be a bit of fudging going on.I will keep on with it because I've got so far, but I think it's fair to say that I will be glad to see the back of it.~~~~~~~~~~This weekend we went to pick up a little cupboard for the hall.  Our hallway is not very big and I hate to see shoes cluttering up the space, this has solved the shoe problem perfectly.(excuse the fuzzy photo, it was taken with my phone at night)The mirror was a little make-over project last week, It was originally black, (another one of my Home Sense finds a couple of weeks ago), I liked the shape but the black was too stark so out came my trusty Annie Sloan paint and a couple of hours later it was transformed :-)~~~~~~~~~~I'm just getting over another cold, second one this year, I don't usually have many colds but these two really slowed me down, must be my age, lol.   I'm still a little bunged up but feel tons better than I did last week.  I bought a pack of multivitamins for 50+ when I went shopping this weekend, apparently you need a different set of vitamins when you are 50+, who knew!Hopefully they will help to put a spring back in my step, ha ha ha, I think in order to do that they will have to transport me back a decade or two as well :-)I hope you are managing to avoid the Winter cold germs and keeping warm and well :-)See you soonHave a great week-X-"},

{"title": "A little stitching, a little knitting and meeting a favourite author", "date": "Monday 25 January 2016", "text": "One of my aims this year was to keep up with blogging once a week, I was aiming for the same day each week, I'm afraid I'm failing at that already, but I have been stitching, crocheting and knitting more so I suppose that's ok.I found this little Christmas freebie on FB and liked the simplicity of it,Just a little bit more stitching to do so i'm hoping to get this made up before the end of the month.I've also been working on a February design for my mantle but as we are so close to February i will save that for another post.My little pink blanket just needs the other side boarder knitted up.Actually, i'm not too keen on this moss stitch boarder, I wish I had done something other than moss stitch, it looks a bit loose compared to the rest of the blanket to me, perhaps it will be better when it's washed?****************Reading...This weekend was our first reading group meeting of the year.  I was really looking forward to it because we had an author visit.  The author was Angela Marsons, she lives locally and writes crime novels set in the Black Country.  Rachel the librarian who runs our reading group recommended her some time ago and it was a month or so before i remembered and went in search of her books and, of course her name kept cropping up at each meeting, soon between us we had got everyone else in the group interested!It has taken over 20 years for Angela to get her work noticed, time after time her work was rejected as being 'ok,' but not quite good enough.  She had more or less given up when Bookouture contacted her and said they wanted to publish her books, she was then signed up for a 4 book deal, (that is now turned into an 8 book deal).  She has also recently secured a print deal for the first 3 books, so they will be hitting the shops latter in the year, but she is still staying with Bookouture as well.Her books are here on Amazon, if you are interested, and where you can read a bit more about her too.She also has two other books which are stand alone books, nothing to do with the Kim Stone novels, these are also on Amazon, I haven't read them, but they are on my reading list for this year. She is such a lovely person, unassuming and totally blown away with the success and attention she is getting now and from hearing her speak on Saturday she will remain loyal to Bookouture and her feet will stay firmly on the ground, her words were, her family will always come first, in particular her partner, for whom she is also the main carerer.   But now she is living her dream of being able to write full time.Her sales for Silent Scream have already hit over one million and it has been released in Italy and due to be released in Germany too!Don't you just love it when something like this happens to a nice person?And....It's one in the eye for all those who rejected her writing for all these years...Like Julia Roberts said in Pretty Woman...Big mistake.  Big.  Huge.Have a great week all!-X-"},

{"title": "Some Wedding Pics", "date": "Thursday 18 June 2015", "text": "Getting back into the swing of things after a holiday is always hard, you spend time relaxing, doing what you want to do rather than what you have to do, enjoying later mornings and eating out then just as you're  thinking, yes, I could get used to this, it's all over, normal service must be resumed.  It hasn't helped that I've been plagued with a migraine and a touch of hay fever for the last couple of days, but I'm at the end of the first week back to normality and I'm sure by next week all will be fine :-)So, the wedding, it all went well and without too many hitches, just a few niggles to do with how the table decorations were done, but that was just me I think, no one else noticed, and Joanne & Gavin's hotel room was on the small side, she had a bit of a rant about that, (how on earth were 1 bride, 3 bridesmaids a photographer and a hairdresser going to get in that room!!).  All turned out ok because the hotel provided a second room on the wedding day for the bridesmaids to get ready. Here are a few of my photos from the day.A bit of fun with cake!Oliver and his daddyBridesmaids, my daughter's Stevie (left) and Jenny (middle),Gavin's sister Katie, (right)The wedding bus for the guests transportAnd for everyone to the receptionThe brides and bridesmaids flowers were lovely, loved thesimplicity of the gypsyphilia for the bridesmaidsEveryone said what a lovely day it was and how much they enjoyed themselves, I was worried that the heat would be a problem but it was just perfect on the day, not too hot and with just a bit of a breeze.It's a strange feeling to have a married daughter, to think that now she has a different name and is someone's wife, I never really gave much thought to that before the wedding, although she is 27 years old I suppose I realise now that she is all grown up, does that sound strange?Gavin is a good lad, and I know he will look after her.Until next time-X-"},

The weather took a backward turn last week, we had a few days of rain and wind, it also went quite cool again and we ended up putting the heating on again.....not good.The combination of rain and sunshine has been good for the garden though, we have a new colour addition, a lovely lilac rhododendron. The weather has been good for my hostas too You either love them or hate them, but I look forward to them every year The Pieris has changed colour yet again, it's now a yellow / gold  colour.My 3 tier planter and baskets are planted up now, fingers crossed they will survive this changing weather.That's all for now-X-"},

My maternal great grandmother put the name of her husband on her youngest daughter's birth certificate, but her husband had already been dead for 5 years!!In WWII my fathers's eldest brother was captured in Singapore and held on one of the 'Hell Ships'.  Really must get back in to working on this some day.My (sort of) claim to fame is that my Great uncle, Benjamin Hodgetts is seen in most the photographs you see of the making of the Titanic anchor/chain, he was one of the men who worked on making it and was also the one who presented a miniature replica of the anchor to the Prince of Wales when he came to the Blackcountry.Now, I am supposed to pass this award on to 10 other bloggers, but I've noticed that quite a few of the blogs I visit have already done it, so, I'm going to throw it open.  If you have not received a nomination for this award and would like to share with us seven things about you please feel free to do so.  And If you do, please leave me a comment so that I can come and be nosey find out more about you :-)I'll be back with a crafty update soon, but for now here is a couple of photos of my Great uncle Benjamin, (because no blog post is complete without photographs, right?)Making of the Titanic Anchor & ChainBenjamin Hodgetts is the one in the flat capAnd presenting to the The Price of Wales, Edward VIIIUntil next time-X-"},
{"title": "Making the most of", "date": "Thursday 23 April 2015", "text": "We are still being spoiled by glorious sunshine here in the Midlands, there is still a bit of a nip in the air early mornings and in the evenings, but I think we can cope with that if it means such beautiful blue sky days. Our garden continues to surprise us with new things and I love sitting out therewith a cup of coffee in the afternoon when I finished work.A couple of miniature roses came home with me this week too, from Home Bargains would you believe, at £1.49 each I could hardly pass up the opportunity :-)They are a lovely pale yellow, which is a bit hard to see on the photo.My lilies are growing too.  I bought these in a pack with the pot from Tesco back in February, they were with the Mother's Day gifts.Oliver is enjoying Nanna's garden too, although his idea of enjoyment is moreenergetic than mine I have managed to focus his attention for a short time filling the watering can or a bottle to give the flowers a drink :-) I love how he is enthusiastic about everything and wants to help, even though it will take me twice as long with him \"helping\" that's ok, I don't mind, the important thing is that he has fun and learns things along the way, he will only be two and a half once and I want to make the most of it, even if it means when I take him to the soft play area he shouts \"come on Nanna\" and I have to climb in too,(now that's a sight you don't want to see, lol)When I haven't been playing on the slide or feeding the ducks this week I've managed to do some more stitching.A few weeks ago I sorted the fabric and the threads for the Lizzie Kate Flora McSample stockings.I was itching to start these but told myself I couldn't until all the PS Santa's were stitched, I still have to make the Santa's up but I will have to set aside time for that because the making up part is not something that I really enjoy doing.So I'm one stocking down, (so to speak!).  It turned out to be quite a quick and enjoyable one to stitch.I'm using the recommended DMC threads. The fabric is 28 count, (unidentifiable because I've had it ages)There are some little buttons to add to the centre of the flowers but I will do all the embellishments together.I know a lot of you stitch in some sort of rotation, while I admired your dedication I always thought that it wouldn't be for me, but when I was stitching last Friday I got to thinking, I have the most time from Friday night and over the weekend and perhaps I could use those days/evening for stitching and fit in some knitting or crochet the rest of the time. I find that i'm tending to flit about on various things lately and not getting much finished.I'm going to give it a try, Friday through to Monday will be stitching on whatever I happen tobe doing at the time. Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday will be knitting or crochet.The only exception would be when we have stitching group, which is the last Wednesday in the month and I shall probably take whatever stitching I happen to be working on then.This might just work ok for me, because if I've got Oliver then a yarn project is more portable, less to pack when I am at my daughter's.....Can't hurt to give it a go anyway.This week we also had a special birthday celebration.Stevie Turned 21 on Tuesday!This was taken around her 3rd birthday,  she would kill me for showing this, but it's a mothers prerogative to do these things :-)Although we didn't see her on her birthday she was back home at the weekend and we went out fora meal with my other daughter's and their boyfriends and I sent her back with a cake and 21 presents to open on her day :-)She finishes uni this year and job wise was very lucky in getting the first post she applied for as a Nursery teacher.In the meantime they offered her 2 day's per week until we come back from holiday when she will go full time.I'm so happy she got what she wanted, ever since she was little she has wanted to work with children, (when she was small she used to tell me that she wanted to have at least 5 babies and 2 exactly the same!! :-OI'll settle for her working with them in the nursery for now, lol)It's been another busy week and I'm ready for the weekend, we are goingto an clothing outlet village on Saturday to look for wedding outfits.  It only 5 weeks on Sunday until we fly out....eek!!Until next time-X-"},

But I never told you what I was doing, just in case you are wondering, I am putting my £20 away each month and will take the money out as and when I need to buy anything.This little pot is hidden away in my craft cupboard.My spending was the result of a visit to the Hobby Craft Show at the NEC at the weekend, where my only stitching related purchase was the necessary threads to start these charts, which were a pre Christmas present to myself :-)I resisted all other temptations of charts and aids to stitching :-)However.... I did purchase yarn for myself,(knitting and or crochet supplies do not come out of my stitching budget ;-)And as daughter #2 has taken up an interest in sewing recently I bought her 4 sewing patterns, which in all fairness were a really good price at just over £3 each - the stall was 3 people deep for most of the afternoon!!One of her gifts to me this Mother's Day was a lovely owl she made.Isn't he lovely?(His feet look odd on this photo, but they are perfectly fine and the same size, I think it's just the way he was hanging)She shared a photo of this on FB the day before Mother's Day, I didn't know then that she would be giving it to me the next day and I was thrilled to bits when I opened it, he has a place on my wardrobe door at the moment and he makes me smile every morning :-)looks like she has unlocked a hidden talent don't you think :-)Well, that's it for now, short and sweet this time and, at least it's an up-to-date blog post, lolHave a great week-X-"},

Just curious nosey, lol.So just the one stitching finish to show for February, I still have one more PS Santa to stitch, but I won't jinx myself by promising to have them all finished by the end of March :-)I mentioned before that a co-worker was pregnant and had asked me to knit a blanket for her, well she had her gender scan and it's a boy!She asked for the same cable pattern blanket I'd knit for my grandson.I made a start at the weekend, it's chunky yarn so is knitting up quite quickly.She left the colour choice to me, just specifying that she wanted blue, I hope she likes what I chose, it's not a true blue but I thought it was a bit more modern looking.We are edging ever closer to DD#2  (Joanne's) wedding, but more importantly at the moment is the hen 'do'. We arranged a meal at a local Greek restaurant, as she is getting married in Cyprus this seemed appropriate, nice civilised meal and night club afterwards for those people wanted to go, we also suggested a weekend in London with afternoon tea and perhaps a show. We thought that the two suggestions would leave no one out, right?Wrong!!We have had people making all sorts of excuses.  I understand (and so do Joanne & Gavin) that a lot of people wouldn't make the trip to Cyprus to see them married, we expected that, but we tried to arrange the hen party so that everyone would be included.  So when my older sister turned round and just said she wouldn't be coming to either the Greek restaurant or the London trip I was non too happy, in fact I was extremely angry, her excuse?? she doesn't like Greek food, (she has never been to Greece or tried Greek food) and she doesn't like the London underground, she has never been to London!!!  I can't bring myself to even phone her at the moment because I feel I will have to say something and I really don't want to cause ill feeling.Anyway, deep breath. Apparently hen party guest have to be given a party bag, really? did you know that? It was news to me, lol.  So we have been in search of  some appropriately tacky, goody bag items , (which I won't subject you to, lol) but as a little keepsake I decided to make a crochet flower brooch. These are my first attempts, not sewn up yet but what do you think? I must confess I really like them :-)I have to make about 20 but will probably make more and choose the best ones.Unfortunately I cannot take credit for the pattern, it's a free one I found on line, I will share the link next time, I printed it off to refer to and can't put my hand on it just now.Hopefully it will be a more stitching related post next time, I really want to get those Sants's finished :-)Until next time-X-"},

I've started knitting a cardigan for one of the girls at work who is expecting, she has asked me to knit her a blanket, which I was very pleased about but she is waiting for her gender scan to choose colours.I've been trying to go for a walk in the afternoons when I can, my back is still quite sore, sitting is more uncomfortable than standing or walking, and I could do with the exercise,:-0Today I went in the direction of a little church which is a few hundred yards from us, St Peter's.  I took these on my phone today, it was quite overcast but I think you can get an idea of what a pretty little church and well kept church yard it is.There are so many churches boarded up, but this one is still in use, there are always lots of cars at the weekendI loved the door, see how worn the stone faces are either side?Next time I will have a look to see if there is a date.Some of the graves were very old and the inscriptions were hard to read.  I like to read the inscriptions, some of them are so very very sad, but I find it interesting and not in the slightest bit morbid, what do you think?I noticed that I have some new followers, which is lovely :-) Thank you for choosing to follow me.   Deb, even went back through my previous posts and left some lovely comments thank you Deb!

I've been measuring it (yes really, I'm that sad, lol), sometimes it's grown an inch over night! I've no idea how tall it will be before it flowers, I'm looking forward to seeing it, I've forgotten what colour I chose so it will be a nice surprise.This was how it looked a week agoThis is how it looks tonight 18 and 1/4 inches tall....a monster, lol It looks as though there is another flower stem growing on the other sidedoes anyone know if this is usual?

It doesn't take too long to get back into the swing of things does it?  and to be honest, I was glad to get back to a routine, the days never seem to have any structure when you are at home, especially when I'd got a bad back and most of what I had got planned couldn't happen.Because I had to change my plans It did mean that I got some stitching done for a change Yayyyy.It's been ages since I've shown any stitching, so here you go, just to prove that I not only stitched, but I actually finished, (yes you heard right, finished!!) 2 ornaments.Prairie Schooler Redwork Santa'sI'm going to be stitching all 8 of these so the actual making up into ornaments I will do once they are all stitched, so stay tuned.  I'm so pleased with these and I'm looking forward to stitching the other 6, only having two colours they are quick and easy to do :-)Just before Christmas you might remember I finished knitting Stevie's scarf, I quite fancied doing one for myself, but I thought that same one might be a bit bulky for me, (being a lady of a certain age I am quite prone to getting rather hot at times ). So I went in search of a freebie via the interweb and came across this crochet one.  Oooh, just right I thought.I used the same yarn as I used for Stevie's as I had some left, Woolcraft Double Crepe DK, shade 09, if you are interested, and it came out quite well I think. I just kept going until I thought it was long enough and used 2 100g balls.I'm not into selfies, but just to show what It looks like on, here you go....minus my face because I take a horrid photo, lolSo, you could say that I have had a very good start to January's crafting :-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I've joined the Goodreads 2015 Reading Challenge again.  I have fallen short on the last two years but I like to set the challenge to keep me motivated, I read 35 last year, 5 short of my challenge, so I'm not too disappointed with that, and I'm continuing with my reading group at the local Library this year too.To keep my stitching mojo up i've joined Stitch From Stash 2015.  I'm allowing myself £20 per month to spend on stash.  As I already have quite a few charts that I want to stitch I think most of my allowance will be going on threads and fabric, finishing items, buttons, ribbon and so on are not included this year, so that's ok.I will have to go and re-read the rules about posting, I'm not good at reading instructions, lolWell that's my news for the first bit of 2015, it's Friday night, my chores are all done, I'm showered and in my PJ's, the tea is all prepared so I can sit down and start another Santa :-)Until next time-X-"},

{"title": "Christmas Ornament Swap, a Scarf and a Blanket", "date": "Monday 15 December 2014", "text": "I've been catching up on blog reading this morning and drooling over all the Christmas trees, decorations and the beautiful stitched ornament finishes you all have.  I'm afraid the only decorating that has been going on in this house is the wallpaper hanging kind.  Stevie will be home on Christmas eve and we are frantically trying to get everything done so she can wake up on Christmas morning in a proper bedroom rather than the store room it has been for weeks. The furniture was ordered yesterday and will be delivered next Tuesday, Mark has put up the paintable paper, so my task this week while he is away will be to paint that so that he can hang the \"pretty\" paper next weekend.  I went on another shopping spree yesterday for new bedding, pillows and a quilt, so hopefully it will all come together by the time she comes home.There are some lovely ornament finishes out there and i'm disappointed with myself that i really didn't manage to stitch much this year, the only ornament i managed to stitch and finish was one for the Christmas ornament exchange on the Needlecraft Haven forum.  Christine organizes this exchange every year and I was to send to Casey, (no blog).   I knew what i wanted to stitch because I've been wanting to stitch this for ages, it has all the elements I love, alphabet, snowman and red :-) I was hoping that Casey would love it too, thankfully she too likes snowmen so I think she was happy with what I chose.Winter Sampler \"Snowman\" free design by Marika Belfiori.I was the lucky recipient of Christine's ornament, this is what she made for me.The design is by Olde Colonial Designs and from this year's JCS Ornament Edition.Isn't it lovely?  Thank you so much Christine.Whenever I've had time to sit down I've been knitting away on a scarf for Stevie.  When we were in Worcester a few weeks ago she saw this scarf in White Stuff, it had a ridiculous price tag so I said I would knit her one and took a photo to remind me of the stitch.Below is the Moss stitch scarf from White StuffAnd this is my re-creation of it.Worked in double moss stitch with a request for the band to be in purple.I'm using Woolcraft double crepe yarn held double. Double crepe should withstand even student washing! and it is lovely and soft and won't be scratchy to wear. There has been a little bit more progress on the Granny Stripe blanket, it's growing, all be it slowly. I'm still loving the colours :-)We are still lacking a Christmas tree, that will not happen until the weekend now, it's the first year in many that my decorations haven't gone up on December 1st, so just to add a little bit of Christmas cheer around the place I've hung some of my stitched ornaments on the metal tree, (which didn't make it into the loft and was still in the garage after the move).Once we have the tree down from the loft they will be hanging on there, for now this will have to do.Hopefully I will get another blog post in over Christmas when the madness has settled down.Have a good week whatever you are doing :-)-X-"},
{"title": "Bonny Scotland", "date": "Tuesday 2 December 2014", "text": "Wow, December already! Where has this year gone?  The months have whizzed by so fast this year, Is it only me that finds it hard to keep up with everything? or do you feel the same?  I need more hours in the day, more day's in the week and more weeks in the year, lol.At least I had a break from work this past week, well, all told, including weekends I had 8 days, it was lovely, no early mornings, no alarm calling me to get up, bliss.  I'm really not a morning person, I prefer to come around slowly, a couple cups of tea and then I might be sociable, until then I prefer to be quiet.  So when my co-worker asked if i would swap and work her afternoon today of course I said Yes! Yayyy, one more lie-in, lol.I really needed this past week to re-charge my batteries but we still have 2 more bedrooms to get ready before Christmas, so it didn't look as though there would be much rest!First though a little bit of R&R was called for, so our soon-to-be son in law was left in charge of hanging wallpaper in the spare room while I swanned off to Ayr in Scotland to spend a long weekend with DH.  I caught the train on the Friday morning, it was 2 trains and about 5 1/2 hours, so plenty of time to work on my blanket both getting to and travelling back home.  I can't remember the last time I sat for so long, it made a pleasant change to just crochet and not to have interruptions.On the Saturday we had a leisurely  browse around the town and I managed to get another couple of Christmas presents then we had some lunch in a pub that was in an old church, the alter was even still there, it felt very strange!, I should have remembered to take photos.  On the Sunday we decided to go to Robert Burns house and museum as it wasn't too far.brigThe house where Robbie Burns was bornEntrance to the Robbie Burns Monument Robbie Burns MonumentBrig O'Doon was just over the road from the monumentSuch a lovely bridge, now just a foot bridge still with the original cobblesMonday came around all too quickly, but it was nice to get away for a few days, can you believe this was my first ever visit to Scotland?  I would love to go again sometime, the people were extremely friendly everywhere we went and the scenery was amazing.I took these from the train window on the way back so they are not the best, but you can get the idea.Except for one shopping outing to Worcester, (where DD#3 did a bit of damage to my bank card), most of the rest of my week off was either spent painting, or collecting pretty things from Ikea and Dunelm, at least the end is in sight for the finish of another bedroom, we're getting there, slowly. How I wish we could wave a magic wand and it would be all done, either that or win the lottery and go away somewhere while someone else did all the work, lol.Apologies if this post is a bit disjointed, I've been trying to publish it since yesterday but my internet connection was playing up, hopefully it will publish now.Until next time-X-"},
{"title": "Granny's China Cabinet", "date": "Thursday 6 November 2014", "text": "I only ever knew one of my Grandparents, my Granny Cox, dad's mum.  I have a very vague recollection of my Granddad Cox, sitting on his chair in the corner of the kitchen, but can't remember any more of him than that. My Granny's name was Cissie and when I was young I spent lots of time with her, I always spent the weekend with her, not because I had to but because I wanted to.   She let me help her around the house and do little jobs for her and she was always patient and very appreciative, telling me I'd done a wonderful job.  If ever I didn't turn up at home after school mum knew that I'd be at Grans. In the afternoon she always went for a lie down and sometimes I would sneak in and lay the table with tea and cake, (there was always fruit cake in a tin in the pantry), then go and wake her and tell her I'd laid the table for tea.  I never felt in the way or that I was doing something I shouldn't or doing it wrong, I hope I was never too much of a hindrance.When you're young you just don't appreciate how hard it was back in the day, but  as I've got older I realise how awful it must have been for her.  She had 3 sons, my dad was the youngest, Uncle Jack, who's real name was Elijah John was the oldest and Uncle Ralph in the middle.  Both my uncles fought in WWII, Uncle Ralph was in the Middle East, Uncle Jack was in Singapore when it was taken, and was captured and was put on one of the so called Hell Ships as a prisoner. He was a Japanese Prisoner for the rest of the War, working in (we think the salt mines.  I have a few details of the camp he was in and his release papers).  There was a time during the war when my Granny and  Granddad didn't know if their two sons were dead or alive, like thousands of other parents.  My dad was in a reserved occupation but wanted to enlist never the less, but, he had an overlapping toe and none of the forces would take him except for the Navy but he must have his overlapping toe amputated first.  The legal age for anything then was 21, and as he was under-age had to have his parents consent, which my Gran refused, saying that she didn't know where two of her sons were and she wasn't going to sign for my dad to go as well.Both my Uncles came back from the War but it had already done it's damage.  Uncle Jack who was well over six feet tall came back weighing a mere 6 stone, he married and had a son but he died aged just 34.  Uncle Ralph also married but divorced, there were no children, sadly he to died in his early 50's .  This is not the way things should happen, my Gran must have carried that heartache around with her every day, yet she was never angry, not outwardly anyway.I was around 13 when my Gran died, she had a stroke one Saturday night while we were watching TV.  I'm glad I was there and that she was not alone.So, Granny's China Cabinet.  It always sat in the same spot in her living room with various bits and bobs in, including a china tea set of course, in those days people didn't swap and change furniture all the time, they looked after what they had, and the cabinet was polished and loved.  After Gran died my eldest sister had a lot of her things, the cabinet being one of them, but for the past, oh, I don't know how many years the cabinet has been sitting in her garage and when she had a recent clear-out she was going to throw it away.Considering how old it is it wasn't in bad condition really.The back board was a different matter, this had definitely seen better days I couldn't let it be thrown away, so took it back home and gave it a new lease of life.It's now in my bedroom with my treasures inside.Sitting in the corner looking like it has always belonged there. And I've got something to remind me of my Gran, who just wasn't around long enough.Thank you for letting me share a little of my Granny's story and, If you are watching Gran, I hope you like what I've done :-)-X-~~~~~~~~~~ps. For those who are interested  the cabinet is painted by me using Annie Slone chalk paint, waxed and then distressed."},

{"title": "Early Morning Ramblings", "date": "Sunday 26 October 2014", "text": "It's almost 5am on a Sunday morning, I decided to get up instead of keep tossing and turning, first I'm hot then I'm cold, can't get comfortable, these hormones have a lot to answer for. ~~~~~~~~~~ We started to hang the wallpaper in our bedroom yesterday, it was late afternoon we were both tired so we ended up having a few choice words to say to each other about how things should be done.  I hate all the mess that decorating brings with it, Mark hates decorating, things were bound to get fraught.  In the end we found a system that worked, me finding the match on the paper and cutting, him pasting and hanging, it worked, we managed a whole wall before we called it a day at around 8.30pm.  I admit I'm finding it hard adjusting to living here, I love the area, I like the garden,  but the rest of it is taking some getting used to.  Ok, number one thing, (these are probably going to sound like silly things to some people, to me they're not, we all have our niggles of what and how we like things).I miss the kitchen in my old house, and my cooker, I really miss my cooker.  That might sound silly but I spent a year thinking and planning that kitchen and it worked, all of it, it was easy to work in.  This one, nothing makes sense, no thought has gone into where things are, and the cooker, well less said about the the better.  I cook in batches when I can and freeze, that way I'm spending less time with it.  No dishwasher...I didn't think this would bother me too much, after all most of the week there is just me and just the two of us at weekends, but it does, It's not the washing up, it's the stuff on the draining board after and the stainless steel sink taking up too much space and being being wet, I hate it, I'm forever cleaning it.No built in microwave...Free standing one on the worktop, taking up space, enough said.Fridge...In the wrong place, or perhaps the fridge is in the right place and the kettle is in the wrong place, but the kettle can't go by the sink and above the fridge because there is no plug socket there. The door...Really, really awkward, when it's open it takes up a lot of space.The cat's litter tray has to be in the kitchen too, no where else for it to go, not ideal but nothing else for it at the moment, the washing machine, again has to be in the kitchen glaring at me from under the worktop, (I don't like appliances on show).  I know these things can be changed, and they will, eventually.  I'm just feeling so overwhelmed with all the things that have to be done, It's not just the kitchen, there are other rooms I'm not happy with, and when it's all done will I be satisfied, or will I still not feel settled here. ~~~~~~~~~~I think we did the right thing in moving, it's just taking time to get used to less space and getting things how we want them.  Maybe it's more to do with me and how I'm feeling than the house, I went to the local shopping centre yesterday, I only had to go to one store but had to walk through a large part of the mall to get to it.  It was a Saturday so there were lots of people and I was so irritated with all these people just ambling along, and the noise, I started to panic a bit, I just wanted to get to the store, get what I wanted and get out of there and back home, I'd no patience for people strolling with nothing  better to do than wander aimlessly round a shopping centre.  I do feel like that quite a bit lately, I want to shut myself away, not bother with anyone, haven't got the patience with people.  I'm not depressed, just overwhelmed and irritated, very easily irritated sometimes, that's the only way I can describe it.~~~~~~~~~~Day two of paperhanging will be happening today, lets hope we can get through it without swearing and any mishaps.If you've read my ramblings, thank you, and If you made it this far, a BIG thank you.  I am turning off the comments though, this is not an 'Oh woe is me please feel sorry for me post'   I wanted to get some things out, and now they are, I might feel better for it, or I might feel just as frustrated tomorrow, who knows, either way I'll get on with it, I always do.-X-"},

It's a nice town with a lovely variety of shops and, I managed to find a wool shop, Budget Wools.  Lots of choice, and of course I came out with a bag full of goodies :-)As the day worn on on Thursday I developed a stinking cold, sneezing, eyes and nose streaming, it came out of the blue as I felt fine until lunch time!  Not what you want when you have time off, so by mid afternoon I was tucked up on the sofa feeling sorry for myself.  I bought tickets for the Great British Food Festival many months ago now and Saturday was the event day at Ragley Hall.  We had a lovely day out, there were lots of different foods to try and things going on.A Man V Food ChallengeSome delicious cakes and fudge (all of which we resisted!)There was a 'Cake Off'Bake a traditional Victoria Sponge cake, 50% of the marks from judges and 50% for the general public.  I so wanted to enter this but really didn't feel up to baking a cake the day before, perhaps next year I will enter. Some interesting burgers on offer.Later we took a walk round the lovely gardens We took Oliver with us for the day, he had a great time running round the large grounds.But didn't know quite what to make of the statues, lolWe had afternoon tea on the terraceWhere there was a very cheeky peacock, which Oliver insisted on running round after and calling a chicken, lolThe view from the terrace, (DH and Oliver on the steps)Our afternoon tea also gave us entrance to the State RoomsI LOVED the library, what a wonderful room!You couldn't actually go into this room, just view from the doorway.Ragley Hall is still a family home to 9th Marquess and Marchioness of Hertford and their 4 children,  we were told that some of the rooms are used by the family therefore there are personal things like family photographs in most of the rooms.We should really visit more stately homes, it's wonderful to see how the other half live!I have one more day off work, and to hopefully get rid of this dam cold, then back to work on Tuesday.  On Wednesday I have a hospital appointment, to have a camera in a place where the sun don't shine,  :-0 ......I think that's all the information you need on that, lol.  Needless to say I will be glad when it's done.Thank you for taking the time to read my ramblings. Until next time-X-"},
{"title": "Crochet, Garden & the Beginings of a Pantry", "date": "Sunday 31 August 2014", "text": "How time flies, can you believe we have been in our new home a month now?  I have no idea where those weeks went.  We have unpacked most of our stuff, but as we have a few jobs to do around the place there are still things in the garage, some things I might not have room for or need, this house is a bit smaller, still largefor a semi but it's from the 1950's rather than 1901, so totally different in respect of room size.  On the whole I like it, it's easier to keep clean / do house work and keep warm, but there are some things that I'm not getting on with too well.  I miss my old kitchen and my cooker,  and the bath is small, it's a good job none of us are on the larger side otherwise we would be in danger of getting our backside stuck, lol but that was always on the list to be changed anyway so we just need time.On the plus side we now have a drive to pull onto instead of fighting for a parking space :-) and the garden is nice, and I have a nice view of it from the kitchen window :-)Our bedroom is in the process of being decorated, well, I've stripped the wallpaper at least, we decided to have new windows so it may be a few weeks before that can be finished, and this week we have started to give the pantry a make over.  The pantry might seem a strange place to start but I wanted more space for food storage and shelves put in, (there was a very old wall cupboard in there which was absolutely no use at all) so hopefully what we have done will make it a more usable space.Here's some'Man at work' photosPantry in progressThe shelves will be painted white, and you know who will have that job, right? lolMark said, 'oh my god when he saw the wall paper :-) I wanted to see something pretty when I opened the door, lets face it, Mark won't go into the pantry that often!So while Mr Fix It was busy doing his builder thing in the pantry I offered to do the lawns and tidy the garden up.Usually he is responsible for the mowing and I will take care of the planting (i.e. the harder work, lol) but today I got to play with the 'big boys toys' :-)I haven't really had a lot of time to spend in the garden, there are lots of different plants and bushes some I have absolutely no idea what they are, others need cutting back and there are probably plants that are yet to show, so I don't want to go digging around and clearing too much until we have seen what comes up, I'm just going to clear / pull up what I know for certain are weeds and deal with anything else next year.The garden is split into patio then two lawn areas which are separated by a deep boarder, I was concentrating on the second lawn area furthest from the house as this needed some shrubs cutting back and weeding.Looking better after the tidy upLooking very green!This is looking towards the furthest end of the garden from the lawn nearest the house, this boarder needs a major clean-up.And this is the lawn nearer to the house, with the left hand boarder cleared but again the area to the right needs a good old clear-out.There is a huge Pieris in the centre of this lawn, well over 5 foot tall, I'm hoping it will be a glorious red when it starts to turn :-)I tell you, when I got up this morning I was aching in places I didn't know I'd got from all that garden work yesterday! Better than any gym workout :-)I'm still enjoying crocheting when I can sit down for a while, It's so much easier to pick up and do a bit rather than getting all the equipment out needed to stitch and, looking round at charts I'm  not getting the same feeling as I used too, It's a phase, I know I will stitch again, just not at the moment.So this is what I've been crocheting:A blanket for my great Nephew.  He saw a blanket that my sister (his Nan) had done and he asked if he could have one too.  She had just started one for my mum so I said I would start one for him and perhaps Nan would carry on with it.  He's only 5, he must have taken a shine to the bright colours:-)More bunting made too, this one is for someone who expressed an interest in the last one I made and wanted some for her camper-van and  maybe will want more to sell in her shop.  I've still got to put this one together and attach the pompoms.Trying out some circles, I have plans for a cushion...eventuallyAnd some new yarn purchased, I love Cath Kidston and was trying to put together something that would resemble CK colours, I would appreciate your opinions on how my choice works, I'm trying to be more colour aware but it's hard, for me anyway.Do you think it needs white? or any other colour?I've also been playing around with pompoms and making something that I'm absolutely in love with, it's autumn related so I'm going to keep you in suspense just a little longer :-)Thank you for visiting my rather long catch-up :-)Until next time-X-"},

{"title": "The House Move Hell Continues!", "date": "Sunday 13 July 2014", "text": "We are still in the middle of the nightmare house sale, we had thought that we might be moving by next Friday but that seems very unlikely to be happening now.  The very last date that we can possible complete is July 24th.  That is the date that our buyer's mortgage offer expires, after which she will have to apply all over again for another mortgage.Honestly, you couldn't make it up what has gone against us with this move, It would take forever to go through it all so I won't, I could have sat and cried on Friday when we hit yet another hurdle, we both really want this move to happen so we are keeping everything crossed, we are in the hands of the powers that be now to make it happen...watch this space!In the meantime, as there has been very little craftiness going on I will share some more holiday photos with you, (and it might bring me out of the gloom going through them too). The day before we flew home we hired a quad bike, (yes I know, my kids had a laugh about that too, mum, on a quad?? must be some middle age thing!!!)  See, they didn't know their leather clad biker mum in her youth, I can still be 'cool' you know, lol.  Anyway we had a great time, and it was a much better way of getting around in the heat, being stuck in a car when the temperature outside is touching 40 would have been no fun!At the end of the long walk of shops and restaurants and the beach was a huge rock, which was (I suppose) left over from when the volcano erupted all those years ago.As this Island was a volcano the sand is not really sand, it's black and made up of shingles, not very good on the feet! We spied a road running up the middle of that huge rock one day when we were out walking, we decided that if we hired transport we would give it a go as the view would be amazing.  It was probably a couple of miles to the top along a zig zag mixture of cobble and concrete road, we should have clocked how far but didn't think at the time.  There were a couple of brave (or insane?) people  walking up there, in that heat, it was probably torture!But what a reward at the end!Looking toward KamariLater we headed over to the other side of the island.  We had seen a building and some masts high up on another hillside and decided to go in search.This time the climb was much higher, and the masts and building turned out to be a military base.The view was amazing, like the view you get when your plane is coming in to land.Our travels took us to one of the ports and another steep zig zag road.  There was not much of anything to see at the port itself but the view of the boats and cruise ships when we got back to the top was worth stopping to look at.Our last stop for that day was at a Winery not far from where we were staying and it seemed like a good place to end our day :-)Santorini is quite famous for wine, (I didn't know that), but being a very dry land they don't keep farm animals, instead, income was made from growing grapes and making wine.The tour and the story of Santorini wine growing was interesting, even if the displays contained weird looking mannequins!I was impressed by the size of these barrels from the 1800's, kept filled with wine to preserve the wood, they were bought over from France.I think I found Micheal Jackson hiding in one of the strange displays, lolThe price included tasting 4 wines, one white, one red and two dessert wines.  We are not white wine drinkers and were not too keen on this one.The red was ok but a little too dry for me.But this! this was the most amazing wine I have ever tasted...ever!It was so smooth you could hardly feel it going down.At  €24 a bottle it wasn't cheap but we just had to bring a bottle back with us :-)  We are going to keep it to celebrate when we move into our new home :-)(Mark did a quick search the other night and can't find it for sale in the UK, if anyone has seen it for sale here please let me know as this won't last for long once it's opened :-)The last wine was also very nice, but by then we had tasted the best so it really didn't matter, lol.We agreed that hiring the quad was a great idea and we should have done it earlier in the week and had it for a couple of days instead of catching a crowded bus, but we will know for next time :-)Hope you enjoyed this other little 'tour' of SantoriniUntil next time-X-"},

Proving that crochet is cool, lol I hope you enjoyed my little tour, I will be back in a few days with part 2.....if you can bare it, lolUntil next time-X-"},

I think I'm up to around 30 or so now.  I did make a bit of a change though, Mark said he thought there was too much white so I've taken one row off, (he doesn't usually give too much of an opinion on what I'm doing so when he does I tend to take notice and have a think), and in this instance I think he may be right :-)I should start sewing the ends in soon I suppose, can you see them all hiding at the back?  That I suspect, is going to be a project all of it's own!Thanks to those who stop by, have a great week-X-"},

{"title": "Catching up", "date": "Sunday 9 March 2014", "text": "It seems that time has been my demon again, I'm full of good intentions, honestly, I am, I'm just not very good at time management lately.  I have been busy though, with crafty things as well as the normal everyday things that seem to steal all of my time (as I'm sure they do yours too).One of my Nieces is due to have her second baby in April and has requested a blanket like the one I knit for Jenny when she was expecting Oliver.  I've been knitting this on and off for a while, far longer than it should have taken really, but at last it's finished!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A new crochet project is on the go.  I'm choosing the colours more or less at random and so far I think they look ok. A few days ago in a quiet moment at work I was browsing the internet and admiring various granny squares and one of the lads came into reception, saw what I was doing and told me that I must stop this, It's not 'cool', (apparently) er..... I'm 52, I think I'm old enough to not give a jot if anyone thinks I'm 'cool' or not, lol.So here is my new un-cool hooky project, which, as it happens, I think is pretty cool :-)I've only finished about 18 squares so far, so there will be loads more to tell on this blanket before it's finished, and I'm trying not to think of all those ends to weave in yet...eekI have to say that I am getting immense pleasure from working all these little squares :-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Stitching is still sort of taking a back seat, larger projects have been abandoned in favour of smaller ornaments, which is about all I have the attention span for at the moment.I've stitched up two freebies but only managed to get one made up into an ornament.Free chart found hereAs usual the finishing was a challenge.  I swear I could have stitched it all again in the amount of time it took me to make it up, and we won't even go into the mess I made whilst sewing!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The only other news to tell this time is that we are on the move.  A couple of weeks before Christmas we put our house up for sale, It was something that had been talked about for a few years but never put into action, but now the time seems right and we were both ready to do it.  We were very fortunate in finding a buyer after only being on the market for about 5 weeks, and a few weeks later we found ourselves a new property.  My initial reaction to selling so quickly was shock, and to be honest I was a little scared, but now that we have found somewhere to go to I'm really excited and looking forward to getting things moving.  I will keep you posted on the progress"},

{"title": "Is There Anyone Still Out There?", "date": "Wednesday 18 December 2013", "text": "Wow, it's been quite a while since I've been here.Occasionally I have scrolled through the pages and glanced at other blogs, but the urge to blog just wasn't there, so i would just go away and forget about it all over again.  But with Christmas just around the corner and another new year about to begin it seemed like a good time to catch up, if there is still anyone out there...My last post was around June time I think, I was not in a happy place at that time and it seemed that my life might be about to take a different turn, I did write something about it at the time because I had no one I could really talk to, (I later deleted that post).   I didn't want to involve family members because they take sides and become judgemental, (one in particular would have been on the phone frequently offering words of wisdom and advice on what I should do and how I should do it!) and I just couldn't handle that, I just wanted to talk, get some things out in the open and not be judged for whatever decision I finally made.Thankfully two fellow bloggers (who shall remain nameless, but they know who they are) gave me support when I needed it, they let me ramble on but didn't judge or criticise me, both of them helped me through those very difficult and confusing months and I shall be forever grateful for their help.So here I am six months later and that whole business seems a long time ago and it feels sometimes like it didn't happen...other times it seems like it was yesterday and there I am full of questions again, I need to be able to believe in my own judgement, you know, take that leap of faith.  I will in time but I'm not quite there yet. But, on the whole things are good, better than I (we) could have hoped for, the weekends are now something we both look forward to.  I suppose it's still all a bit new but I know that we are better, kinder, calmer and more considerate people for it, we have learned a very hard lesson, one that I don't think either of us will forget.So, Christmas is just around the corner and we are looking forward to it.  All 3 girls will be staying at home this year, Stevie is home from uni at the weekend, Joanne and her boyfriend, Gavin, and Jenny and Oliver will be staying over for a couple of days too, so we will have a house full, it will be noisy and hectic and no doubt very messy, but so good :-)  There will be one person missing out on all the family fun though,, Jenny's boyfriend, Oliver's daddy, James won't be here for Christmas or new year, he will be serving in Afghanistan until April, we will of course be taking loads of photos and videos of Oliver to send to daddy so that he can a least see that his little boy had a great Christmas. Obviously other things have taken priority over recent months and I haven't been doing much stitching at all.   There were a couple of things that I had started and wanted finished before Christmas, so when the mood took me I worked on those.  One was Oliver's Christmas Stocking and the other was Baby It's Cold Outside.  I'm so happy to have been able to at least those two  this year.Shepherds Bush Thomas Stocking re-named for OliverI managed to stitch the stocking in secret and surprise Jenny when it was completed at the beginning of December. I think It's fair to say that she was over the moon with It.It will be a while before Oliver appreciates all the love that his Nanna put into making this for him, but hopefully it will one day become a talking piece when It gets its annual outing. This is Baby It's Cold, I really enjoyed stitching this one.Apologies for the blurry photo on this one, it's the only one I could find and it was from my phone.Not much in the way of stitching to show for my absence is it eh?Hopefully I will have more in the way of finishes to show for 2014.I'll try not to leave it too long between visits in future.Have a great Christmas all!-x-"},

They doctor at our local A&E couldn't get it out so made an appointment at ENT for me today.  After just over half an hour of two different doctors picking away at it it was getting very uncomfortable so they have said it would be better for me to be admitted as a day case and have aesthetic so they can remove it.  I should get a phone call in the next few days and hopefully they will be able to fit me in early next week.  What is left of the ear plug has stuck fast (which is why it was sore when they were trying to get it out) but is not where it will cause any damage, I just can't hear anyone unless they are to my left side, lol.~~~~~~~I will have some stitching to show next time, my Christmas ornament for May is all made up ready and I made good progress on Baby It's Cold at the Needlecraft Haven meet up before I went away.  I don't know how much more stitching I will fit in though as the next month is going to be a busy one, I'm away on holiday again in just over a week's time and Jenny has booked Oliver's Christening for the beginning of June and has nominated me to make the cake...eek!!! until next time x"},

It's very simple to throw together and makes a HUGE pot which I then put into pour and store bags before freezing, It makes a very filling meal, more like a stew than a soup, and best of all, it's Free  on Slimming world :-)I also made up a batch of Leak and Potato soup, using this recipe from Slimming Eats It's a lovely creamy soup, again very filling.When the soups are cooked I always blend half (this is before the blending) and leave half chunky, you don't need to, but that's the way I prefer them.My other cooking yesterday involved a chocolate fudge cake for DD#2 who is 25 today.HAPPY BIRTHDAY JO. XXI hope you enjoy your cake :-) Yes, I know there are only 5 candles, that's all I had in the cupboard.I wrapped it up in a fancy cake cellophane bag.Stevie had bought her a DVD, so we made the present a little bit more interesting by putting popcorn, sweets and a bottle of Pepsi in a popcorn bucket (which i begged from the lovely cinema Manager!!)The whole thing was then wrapped up in florist cellophane and tied with some fancy ribbon.  Good eh?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~And last, but by no means least, I was lucky enough to receive one of June's ornaments.She also included a lovely needle minder and a cute Christmas card.Thanks so much June, everything is truly wonderful and will be forever treasured      xx.That's all for now folks, stay safe and warm, until next time. x"},

Thanks for the advice on the plant too Cath :-)  Katherine also let me know that it is the state flower of Colorado.  So now i'm just going to let it flourish, how could i possible get rid of something with such a pretty name and a one that has a title too!~~~~~~~My eldest daughter had her 20 week scan on Monday, I'm glad to report that all is progressing nicely.  Apparently this scan is known as the gender scan, apart from checking that everything is as it should be, they were also asked if they wanted to know what it was.  They were both agreed that they didn't want to know what it was before the birth, Jenny's answer to anyone who asks what she's having is, \"it's a baby\" !She will most likely want to kill me for sharing this photo!~~~~~~~~~~~~~I do have a stitching finish to share this time too (about time I hear you say!)Can you guess what it is?It's Dandy Dreams by Silver Creek SamplersI enjoyed stitching this so much, once I started I couldn't put it downMark, at the stitching shop did a lovely job with the framing again, he even customised this frame for me, he painted the frame to match the green thread i used and distressed it.Here it is a little closerThis one will have a place in the guest bedroom, (which should be finished next week)The Give AwaySince I enjoyed this one so much I thought someone else might like the Dandy Dreams chart :-)If you would like your name entered in the draw please say so in the comments only, (not by email), and I will draw a name next Wednesday evening, June 6th.Oh, and it will be open to anyone, home or overseas :-)Until next time..."},

{"title": "At Last - The Kitchen", "date": "Thursday 17 May 2012", "text": "Paint and brush have been my new best friends lately, but at last there is an end in sight.  I always underestimate the amount of time it takes to paint walls, i start out thinking it'll take a couple of hours and what feels like weeks later i'm still at it!  It's all the little bits that take the time, that and the fact that once you decorate one room it shows another one up, or in my case two other rooms.  Being an old house our bathroom is downstairs and off the kitchen, so we, well ok, I decided that it needed freshening up, so that room too has had a little make over, fresh paint, towel holders, new radiator and a new door.  Our dining room is also off the kitchen so that room is on my next hit list, perhaps in a few weeks time when I've had time to recover.So, the kitchen is done, well apart from another coat of paint on the radiator and a radiator shelf which Mark has promised me is being made at work as we speak.  Now, at last i can show you some photos of the smallest kitchen which has taken the longest time :-)The kitchen i inherited when we moved in lacked cupboard space, so i spent a lot of time thinking about what i wanted in the way of cupboards and storage.Although i liked our old green units and wooden counters it did make the kitchen feel small, so we knew we wanted something light.We are lucky enough to have lovely high ceilings in this house so we were able to go for the taller units, the one in the corner is hinged in the middle making it a double cupboardThe drawer unit holds all my utensils(top drawer is knives, forks etc.)My herbs and spices in another drawermuch easier than rooting around in a cupboard for them.I bought a roll of grip liner from the £ shop which stops them rolling aroundBefore, the microwave was on the counter taking up precious work space, now it has it own home.The angled cupboard next the the microwave is next to the window and was the kitchen designers idea and i think it works really well.The tall double doors on the other side is the larder unit, and the best thing, i just love it :-)It has shelves from top to bottom and houses all our food.Our sink is smaller than the belfast sink we had before, but again it works better size wise in the kitchen space, and we have a dishwasher so don't need it for washing dishes.It was hard to take a picture of because of the light from the window, but you get the ideaThe worktop is granite and fantastic for keeping clean and tidy.We decided against tiles on the floor, instead we went for cushion flooring.  We got some very strange reactions when we mentioned cushion floor, (or old lady flooring as one of my daughters called it).  Whatever you choose to call it i'm glad we decided on it, it's much easier to keep clean and warmer to walk on, and all my daughters now agree, it was a good choice :-)(The one we went for is Rino Floor and is nothing like the lino/cushion floor of years ago)(The room you see in the background is the bathroom, waiting for it's new door, i know, good job we don't get many visitors!!   Please excuse marks work clothes on the washing basket.  The small space you can just see between the kitchen and the bathroom houses the washing machine and tumble dryer)Now this is my baby, lolI fell in love with this cooker when i saw it.What else can i say, i think it's beautiful :-)The whole kitchen feels much bigger and is so much easier to work in, i'm glad i waited, thought about what i needed and how it would work and had what i wanted.I finally got round to finding a place for and hanging my Chat Noir poster too :-)I just love that crazy faced cat, lolAnd see my little chicken?Mark just rolled his eyes when i bought it home, lolBut don't you just love her little face :-)The Kitchen ChickenUntil next time xx"},

Wow, been a while since I've done that!  Stevie joined along with me and she also reached her one stone target Christmas week!  at 5' 9\" she doesn't need to loose too much but it has been a great way to make her aware of the rubbish she was eating, getting her off McDonald meals, getting her to eat wholemeal bread and more fruit and yoghurt :-)2011 was also the year in which my husband finally gave up smoking! like all smokers he has tried several times, but it never lasted long, this time it's been almost 6 months since he quit, what's made a big difference this time is the fact that he did it because HE wanted to, no nagging from me, and I've been very careful not to keep asking if he's had a cigarette, he has said this makes a difference because he is not reminded of it all the time.  Fingers crossed that he has kicked the habit for good this time - he and his clothes smell so much nicer, lol~~~~~~~~~~~~~~It was fantastic to read all your birthday wishes on my milestone birthday, it meant a lot to me that you stopped by:-)There was a really great surprise from Elaine.  With everything she has going on at the moment she still managed to remember my birthday and sent me a $25 gift certificate to spend at Wasatch Needlecraft, thank you so much Elaine your thoughtfulness really touched me.  I'm really looking forward to a new start when my charts arrive :-)I can't go without showing you my Pandora bracelet that Jenny bought meShe also bought me the present charm to go with it, Joanne bought me my birthstone with the turquoise stone and Mark bought me the cross stitch charm, (with a gentle reminder from me, i knew i just had to have that one when i saw it, lol)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Thank you to everyone who follows my blog and take the time to leave me a comment, I really do appreciate each and every one :-) See you all next year!****  HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU ALL  ****"},

{"title": "The (not so) Quick Catch Up", "date": "Tuesday 2 August 2011", "text": "I know that you have heard it all before, but I really didn't intend to be MIA for so long.  I kept thinking about blogging but that's as far as it got, something else always got my attention.  I feel a bit bad because i had lots of wonderful comments about my sampler wall in my last post, and i want to thank you for that, they really made my day :-) I'll catch up quick about what's been keeping me away from you all (don't want to bore you all to death now i'm back ;-) ~~~~~At the beginning of July me and DH went to Skiathos for a week and spent a very relaxing time at this pool, drinking copious amounts of wine and gorging ourselves on delicious Greek food.Unfortunately all good things must come to an end and we came home to rain and a mountain of washing the girls had kindly left.On the following Monday the workmen arrived early to start the new patio, in fact, Monday was the only day they arrived early, late starts and early finishes seemed to be their way of working. After the digging out I suppose I'm just being picky, but starting at 9am and finishing before 3pm (most days) when they could clearly carry on with things is a bit much (or not much) IMO.  There were other issues with what they did which i wont go into, lets just say a one week job took them two weeks and would have taken longer if DH hadn't got on the phone and insisted they come the next day and finish off, otherwise he was going to get someone else in to finish and charge them... strangely enough they were knocking my door at 7.30am the next day!  This was no fly by night company, they are quite well known in this area and always seem to have lots going on, perhaps we were just unlucky with the team sent to us.  Anyway, it's done and it looks OK.DH has been busy re-coating the shed and the walls where the ivy is has to be painted which DD#2's boyfriend is coming to start tomorrow afternoonTalking of Jo, she and her boyfriend have moved into a place together.  They are renting a lovely house that has recently had a make over so everything is new, kitchen, bathroom, decorated and new carpet throughout.  Although that wasn't without problems, they had a bit of a leak in the bathroom which came into the kitchen, no real damage but there may be some water marks left when it's dried which the landlord has said he will get re-painted if it does.  There was also no plug to connect the washer, but he got that fixed right away.  So now we are 3, and boy is it quiet, lol.  Stevie now wants to move into the bigger bedroom so we have a decorator coming next week to strip the paper off and re-paper.~~~~~Stevie has a new part time job too, she is working at a hotel, the hours are very unsociable and because college is finished for the summer she is working lots of extra hours, the poor girl is shattered, although she did brighten up when she picked up her wages last week, she could very well be one of the richest students at college in September because the hours she works don't allow for much of a social life!!  It also means that mum and dad, (but mostly mum) have to be available at 4.30 to do the taxi run to work, dad will fetch back unless she is on after 12.30 then a lift if provided for staff.  I'm thinking of getting a taxi sign for the top of the car and charging by the mile!!~~~You can see why computer time is limited, when I did manage to get some stitching in last week I worked on Sampler aux Chat.  I didn't show an update last month because of our holiday, so this is two months progress.Molly got in on the act when I took it into the garden to photographI'm using Threadworx 1089, but I'm not sure I like the stripey effect it gives on the cat, what do you think?  Should I change the thread to a non variegated just for the cats?I was going to show the cakes I've been baking and a wonderful coffee set that my sister gave me, and tell you about the stitching group I'm trying to set up, but I'll save that until next time because way back at the beginning of this post I did promise a quick update and now I think I've just about outstayed my welcome ;-) so If you have made it this far, thank you for staying with me!Until next time x"},

Now call me picky if you like, but this is the most famous bridge in Venice, and is in effect where it all started, the centre,  so you would think that there would be a little more pride at keeping it clean and tidy - Just my opinion.You can see how busy the Grant Canal is, this is the best photo i could get of the bridge.﻿This is looking under the Rialto﻿I have another little gripe.The Bridge of Sighs.  Everyone who visits Venice wants to see the Bridge of Sighs, this is what greets youThey have covered the sides of the Doge's Palace (on the left) and the prison (on the right)  with this horrendous cloud/sky boarding.  There is restoration work going on and i know that these building have to be maintained, but come on, surely the advertisers who are paying for the restoration could have come up with something better than this??  And who agreed to such an eyesore? Most disappointing.See the small bridge in the middle of the photo, the one groaning under the weight of all those people? That is facing the Bridge of Sighs, when prisoners were lead across into the prison their families would stand on that bridge and be able to wave farewell to their loved ones.OK, you are probably thinking by now that i didn't enjoy Venice, i did enjoy it and there were some lovely things to see.St Marks Church being one of themSome pretty viewsAnd to end with the obligatory night photo, this was a bridge quite close to our hotelI have put a couple of photos here and i will add more there over the next few days if anyone wants to take a look.Normal service of stitchy updates will follow soon :-)"},

{"title": "Getting Plastered!", "date": "Monday 28 March 2011", "text": "You really couldn't make this up!~~~~~~It turned out to be a day and a half yesterday.   I started the day by falling down the stairs, top to bottom, wrenched both arms backwards trying to stop myself and banged my foot.  It did knock me for six but i carried on...as you do, with the weekly ironing.  Then i get a text from my eldest sister to say they have taken mum to the hospital because she was having palpitations and trouble breathing, she'd been given a ECG and was waiting to see the doctor.  So off i go to the hospital, my foot was hurting but not too bad, i could walk.  We waited 5 hours in A&E, yes you read right, they gave an 82 year old woman an ECG then left her in the A&E waiting room for 5 hours, i did go and ask how much longer, a couple of times, but you know A&E, makes no difference.  When she was eventually seen by a doctor he did a thorough examination and he was very nice with her, they checked her blood, that was OK but the doc didn't like the look of her ECG so she had to stay in over night.  My eldest sister stayed with her while me and my younger sister went to her home to collect overnight things.  By then my foot was starting to hurt more.  Took mums things back to hospital, i was having trouble walking then but got on with it.  Another couple of hours with mum in the Emergency Assessment Unit waiting for yet another doctor to come and check her over and confirm that she was to stay in, yes, she had to stay in and have another ECG in the morning then they would compare them.We had to ask 3 times for a blanket and pillow for mum, she had had nothing to eat or drink since about 2 o'clock that afternoon, a nurse said they would bring a plate of sandwiches and a cup of tea, which never arrived and the shop had nothing left except some muffins!  We asked again and she was bought a packet of sandwiches with a choice of ham or salmon, nothing to drink, so off again in search of a vending machine!So by this time my foot is really killing and by the time we left at 12 o'clock i was having real trouble walking at all, but i was the one driving.  We went back to mums to feed her cat and turn off lights etc.  Went to open the door to go, it wouldn't budge, we were locked in the house!.  Julie, my younger sister said, I'll climb out of the window and unlock the door, no can do, the windows are locked and we didn't know where the key was.  We then had to call my BIL to come up and let us out!!  He had to help me to the car and off home i went, Joanne took one look at my foot and said, mum i think you should go back to the hospital (my foot was a funny colour and swollen by this time)  So off we go again, Joanne drops me and Stevie by A&E and goes to park the car, but i can't walk at all and am trying to hop across the car park, Stevie trying to hold me up without laughing to much!  There was a guy stood outside the door who came to our rescue with a wheelchair, bless him, i don't know how we would have got to the door if he hadn't come to rescue us.This time, thankfully, we didn't wait too long before i was seen, but while i was waiting for my xray the doctor who had seen mum earlier walked past and did a double take and came back and asked what I'd done and went away shaking his head, lol.  After xray i was wheeled back and the same doctor came past again and asked if i had been seen yet, (no i hadn't) he said he had finished his shift but would get the Doctor to have a look at me and my xray.  The doctor on duty didn't come, but he did and looked at the xrays himself and examined my foot coming back with the news that it was indeed broken!!So now i look like this..I have an appointment at the fracture clinic on Wednesday afternoon to have this plaster off and another xray and then they will decide whether to put another cast on.~~~~~~On the upside i will have plenty of stitching time over the next couple of weeks (insert big grin here!) I put a lot of time into LHN last week, i love this one :-) And the whole thing so far.Mary Glover had an outing at the weekend. How pants is stitching over one!!  I think i stared at it for ten minutes before attempting a stitch, then when i did manage some stitching i ripped them out again.  Finally i think i got it sorted, i still have the alphabet underneath the words to do and i will grit my teeth and get around to that this week.Saturday was a better day than yesterday with the Hobbycraft and Sewing for Pleasure, i had a lovey day out and gsome goodies which i will share with you another time.  For now I'm going to catch forty winks as i didn't sleep very well last night.Take care"},

So, back to the weekend in Weymouth, i didn't get any shopping done in the end, we opted just to walk and look around, i did drag Mark into a tea shop to partake of a cream tea, not really the thing that builder blokes go for but he knows i can never pass up on the opportunity for a warm scone with jam and clotted cream, in fact i can very rarely pass on the opportunity of cake of any description:-)See how the wind wipped up the clouds, aren't they great, i love big fluffy clouds, lol Here's some more over the Harbour I've only been to  Weymouth once before, when the girls were smaller, but i remember the clock, when i mentioned it to Mark he said he couldn't remember seeing a clock although he has been there since January and must have driven passed it several times, i swear he goes around with his eyes shut, lol, i mean, how could you miss something like that!The Jubilee Clock - built to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. I would have loved a photo of the whole thing but there are some major road works going on and they chose the base of the clock to store that horrible orange netting and barriers.Here is another fantastic building on the sea frontThis church is just at the back of the holiday park Mark is working at, a really lovely place, and the grounds are kept very neat.  Don't you just love that entrance! I cropped the next photo down and it does look a little squashed but i liked it because it shows the horse on the hill in the background, can you see it?I was told, rightly or wrongly(someone may be able to confirm or dispute this perhaps?) that the horse was put there because George III used to ride his own house up and down that hill.And on that note i will leave you, i have to get into my own chariot now and collect my daughter from workI will share a few more pictures on my photo blog over the next couple of days."},

I mentioned last time that i was going to start a 365 photo blog.  I made my first post tonight, i hope you will pop over and take a look and maybe a comment to start me off?Until next time x"},

How cool is that?   I suspect this is not news to the more techie (is that the correct spelling!) minded, but to me it was a revelation and I'm so impressed with myself that i managed to do it, lol. So how does it look, my new LHN background?  I know, i know it's a bit 'red' and a bit 'Christmassy looking'  but we are still in winter, and that is my favourite LHN ornament finish :-) Talking of photos, have you seen some of the new photo a day blogs out there?  What a great idea, and yes i am thinking of making another blog, I'll let you know when it's up and i hope you will come visit me there too :-)  If you have started a photo a day blog please let me know where you are so i can come visit you :-)While my stitching has been a non starter this week i have been reading.  I finished Wideacre last night, I've updated my 2011 reading page (at the top of my blog) with my take on the book (I've never written a review before and felt a bit silly doing so), but i thought it would help me remember the book and help to exercise my aging brain!  I kept it short and to the point till i get the hang of it.I have made a little progress on Molly, very, very little, still working on the tree so i won't bother showing you more brown/green stitching this time.  Off now to try and make more headway on said tree.Until next time x"},

And just to prove that it's still not over we woke to snow again this morning. Within half an hour everything was covered in the white stuff. As it was such a nasty morning i dropped Stevie off at College before work, the round trip would usually take about 20 minutes, this morning it took me an hour, the traffic was backed up all the way, I'm not a patient driver so was pretty miffed when i got into work (half an hour late!!). By mid morning the snow had turned to rain and things were back to normal on the roads. Good job too as Joanne has her second driving test tomorrow afternoon, could you please keep your fingers crossed for her? She has her little KA all ready, plus it's costing a fortune for all these lessons and tests!!~~~~~~~~~~I made a start on Molly on 1st January Quite a lot of brown going on at the moment, but i love the way it's looking so far. Most of this was done whilst watching repeats of Downton Abbey. Did anyone else watch it? What a great series, I'm having Downton withdrawal, and we have to wait until the Autumn for the next one to air! The house that was used in the series is Highclere Castle, it looks wonderful, you know me and historic houses, i can already feel a little trip coming on in the summer, lol~~~~~~~~~~I had to order some more threads for Molly from So and Sew this week and this chart found it's way into my basket. I just love it! but whats not to love? it has a house and an alphabet, two of my most favourite things : -) Talking of Sew and So, have you visited their site lately? If not take a look, it's been revamped and browsing is much easier, now you can set up a password and save your details, review orders, create a wish list and, i noticed they have gift certificates too. I wish i had ordered them over Christmas now though, i could have avoided the VAT increase that happened on 4th Jan, missed out on saving myself some pennies there.Thank you for your visits and your lovely comments and encouragement, I'm glad there are such lovely people out there:-)Edited to say that Joanne just got back and she PASSED her driving test!!Until next time...x"},

In years past i have been one of the last to put my Christmas tree up and the first to take it down, the years must have mellowed me, i have enjoyed my decorations and appreciated the time I've spent at home this holiday. I have a friend who itches to go out at any opportunity and just hates to hang around her house, not so me, i love pottering around home, and I'm comfortable with my own company, i suppose it wouldn't do for us all to be the same.~~~~~~~~~~So by tomorrow i hope these have all been eaten so as not to tempt meBecause it's back to sensible eating for me, although i have tried to moderate myself i will still need to do a few hours step up's on the Wii to compensate for my indulgence ;)~~~~~~~~~~I've enjoyed seeing everyone's round up of the years stitching, there are some lovely slide shows out there of the most beautiful finishes, you are all such a talented bunch! I had 15 finishes this year a couple were carried over (the larger ones), if you scroll back to the top of my blog there is a slide show at the top right so i won't put up another one. I really enjoyed the LHN ornament SAL this past year, and it gave me the chance to have a go at finishing, I'm still not perfect but at least now i have some idea and not so afraid of having a go :-)For 2011 i have a few charts i would like to stitch like these... And these But that could be subject to change if something else takes my fancy, lol. I've also got a stack of 'freebies' that i want to stitch too.One i do want to finish is Beatrix Potter  This is the first time I've shown BP, when i started it i was reluctant to share it because i wasn't sure i would carry on with it, being such a big project i thought i might loose interest, anyway i picked it up again this week and I've decided that it's a keeper, so watch this space!~~~~~~~~~~As i don't make resolutions the only other thing apart from stitching goals is to carry on with my reading. I fell behind in my list keeping last year but i read 25 books, not bad going for me :-) I've had quite a few books for Christmas so I've got plenty to keep me going for now.~~~~~~~~~~We are having a quiet New Years Eve. We will be going for a curry early this evening then coming home to see the New Year in. I hope you all have fun however you are celebrating :)Thank you for your visits in 2010, they have been very much appreciated :-) HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!"},

I have a few things to share, namely the last of my LHN ornaments, i have really enjoyed these, i can't believe it's been 12 months since we started this SAL!  The only one i didn't get finished into an ornament was the Pear Tree, i cut the fabric too close when i finished stitching and the only thing i think it will finish as is a pinkeep and as yet I'm not brave enough to try that finish.  Any how here are the last two:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~My favourite out of these two is definitely All is Calm, so cute! I did one last trip into town today and there was a half price sale of Christmas decorations, amongst other things i couldn't resist this metal tree  Isn't it perfect for stitched ornies :-)It will hold 15, so I'll have to get busy for next year, but I'm also thinking it could be used for seasonal ornies too as it's not a Christmasy looking tree, what do you think?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Last but by no means least is a lovely gift i received from Elaine, such a pleasant surprise to receive this lovely stitched and finished snowman ornament (there were also some chocolate Santa's that got eaten right away :-) and some lovely hand and body lotion which is now in my treatment basket in my bedroom:-)Thank you so much Elaine, everything was appreciated and your snowman will always have a special place on my tree :-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Well the presents are all wrapped and ready  and i will be heading of to bed soon, tomorrow i have the day off preparing food as we are going out for Christmas lunch this year, Yipeeee no cooking, lol.  My mum, sister and brother in law and my Niece and her boyfriend and their daughter are coming too so hopefully it will be a good day.  After lunch we are going to my eldest daughters for more nibbles and present opening.Boxing day will be my day to sit and stitch and play with my presents :-) and then the day after will be my birthday! 2011 will be my last year in my 40's ;-) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Have fun whatever you may be getting up too - Until next time - have a good one!"},

I can report that the fame hasn't turned her head one bit, she is still the same self assured Molly who gets her own way with everything :-)The local paper that featured the competition are doing a follow-up on it so my mug shot will be in there in the next couple of week (I'm preparing myself for the comments from work about that!)~~~~~~~~~~Last week i was in and out the house for one thing and another and couldn't settle into stitching except for finishing another LHN ornament. This is Peppermint Twist made up into yet another puffy pillow (are you getting fed-up seeing this type of finishing yet!)  I left off the button, i didn't think it added anything to it. While i was out and about last week a few things made it home with me.  My LNS had this limited edition DMC box in, it's on sale with 40 threads included but Sharon said if i wanted the box she would knock off the price of the threads, how could i pass a chance like that!Isn't it great! (you will have to tilt your head to one side now because i just couldn't get blogger to co-operate!!)It fastens with rustic string a a little heart toggle.  I think i only ended up paying about £6 for it, bargain! Continuing with the bargain hunting,  i came across this little box in a local department store It's all shabby  & chic and i love it!  When i get round to sorting more of my threads out this is where they are going :-)I've saved the best bargain until last, while i was collecting \"the calendar\" i spied thisHow gorgeous is this shopping basket!!  It cost me all of a fiver!

I was over the moon :-) but, it gets betterI emailed them the photo as they asked, and today i got reply to say that Molly has actually been chosen as the overall winner and her photo will appear on the cover of the calendar, and we also get to choose which month she will be! How cool is that!!! Even better still is that she has also won a photo session with a professional photographer who will come to our house and take a set of photos which i will the be given on a disc (insert big grin here!) Here she is the super model herself in her winning shot  And because i have 2 beautiful girls i can't leave without showing a photo of Millie too, after all a mother has no favourites ;-)  I wish now I'd got  a better photo of Millie too, then i could have entered them both, although It's harder to get a good shot of Millie because she is so fast and she thinks everything is a game, and being all black makes it harderMillieI can't tell you how much we love these two little faces, they mean the world to us.Until next time x"},

While we away last week i was phoning home every day just to check up everthing was OK, as you do, on the Thursday night my daughter asked me if i wanted the bad news.. as you can imagine everything raced through my head at those words, what i wasn't expecting was \"someone's run into your car mum\" That would have been bad enough, but i have had this car (a super duper Mini Cooper s, bright yellow in colour and complete with racing stripes!!) for less than a month.~~~~~~~~~~This is the best photo i could come up with which resembled my car. The difference being, mine has white wing mirrors and normal alloys, not silver. (this one i've uploaded though looks more like a dinky car, don't you think?) Luckily (if you can call it that) it was the fault of a neighbour 2 doors up and she wrote all her insurance details, date and time it happened down a gave them to Stevie. Now, we live on a very steep hill, so i assumed she had parked behind my car and rolled when she pulled away, but no, she had parked outside her own house, gone in home and when she looked out of the window, no car, she must have forgotten to put the handbrake on and it rolled down the hill colliding with the back end of my car on the way! The damage is not too bad, the bumper will have to be replaced and the little black grill, but apparently the damage on hers is much worse, i haven't seen.However, as if that wasn't bad enough, i needed to go and get some food supplies in on Tuesday afternoon after getting back from the airport very early hours Tuesday morning, but my car wouldn't start, after calling the dealer we got the car from, and an AA man being sent out i was told that the starter motor would need replacing and it would have to be towed to the dealer garage the next day. Another AA man arrived the following day and tried it again before loading it on the truck, right away he said it was not the starter motor but the timer chain, much more serious and as far as i can make out is a big job, we are talking getting the engine out and stripping it down job!I mean, this car is not old, 3 years is all! I've had a right game trying to get the dealer to give me a courtesy car (they were all out, yeah right!) when i asked about a hire care they said yes, you will have to pick it up from Stafford though, a 45 minute drive away..HELLO, I HAVE NO TRANSPORT HOW DO YOU SUGGEST I GET THERE??!!! no answer came the reply. Several phone calls later and after me ranting & raving like a woman possessed and telling them that if they didn't sort it out they could keep the car and give me my money back they said they would send someone out to pick me up and take me to Stafford to fetch the hire car.Goodness knows when I'm going to get my car back, they won't commit themselves to a time yet, but at least i will have some sort of transport while it's in. The damage done to the rear end will have to wait until this episode is over.Apart from coming back to this we had a lovely week away in the sunshine and i will post some photos next time so you can have a look see, for now though i really can't get in the mood for anything. A happier update to follow soon i hope, until then take care and have a good weekend."},

So i got a move on and completed another 2. Here's the Red House.  I didn't have the required red for the house so i used my favourite red, Threadworx 1089I do love little houses, and i think this one is my favourite ornie at the moment.~~~~~~~~~~Next is another cute little snowman, i wasn't too kean on this when i first saw the chart but he has grown on me since stitching him.Again i substituted the green because i didn't have what was called for, i used a Weeks thread instead.~~~~~~~~~~Not in the Christmas theme but, i do have another finish, Souvenir de France which was a freebie doing the rounds a while ago. Finished as a pin pillow using DMC 4140 (variegated thread).  It's a little big for a pin pillow really but at least i now have somewhere to stick my needle when i finish stitching for the night :-)~~~~~~~~~~I have been working on Yesteryear a little too but it got abandoned in favour of all the above, it's on my list to get finished off by the end of October though if i possibly can.~~~~~~~~~~I'll be MIA for the next week, we are going on our last sunshine break of the year, we shall  be in Gran Canaria by this time tomorrow night, hopefully i'll be sitting somewhere warm with a glass of Sangria in my hand, lol.Thank you for your visits and comments, they really make my day :-)Have a great week whatever you may be up to. xx"},

We had our day in Bath as planned non the less and apart from a couple of quite heavy (but short) downpours the day turned out not too bad. As none of us had been before we did all the touristy things, the Jane Austin Centre, the Roman Baths, Pulteny Bridge, Royal Crescent (the setting for Jane Austins Persuasion if i my mind serves me right) and Sally Lunns tea shop, where i sampled a Bath Bun (the girls opted for cake). We had gone there for their Cornish Cream Tea but there were no scones left!! can you believe that?? our faces must have been a picture because we had been anticipating this cream tea all day! Apart from that we had a fantastic time, it's a great place and we will defiantly go again perhaps to do a tour of all the wonderful shops. All the links above should be clickable, do go and have a nosey around there are some great web sites.Here's a little collage of our visit. See Joanne top right? that's her, large as life and twice as loud, lol. They both tried the hats on in the Jane Austin Centre, somehow i don't think they fit the image of Lady's who lunch, lol.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I managed to get quite a bit of stitching done while i was at home, i started and finished the design of Primitive Bettys.Olde Pewter LettersStitched on 28ct with DMC 169 & 535Not to sure if i should frame it or finish it some other way, any suggestions?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I found a forgotten piece and have been working on getting this finished, this is where it was at when i abandoned it.Now almost another 2 blocks completed, so hopefully a finish soon, and it's a fitting piece to hang in my 100 year old house :-)LHN Yesteryear~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Finally, i collected Rubie from the framers last week, here she is all dressed up!She now has pride of place on my sampler wall, which is a work in progress but i am working hard to get it filled ;-)Phew! I've waffled on again haven't i! you'll be Glad to know that all for now, thank you for visiting my little space today, i really appreciate all you visits and comments.

I really wanted her to have a face to show you tonight but as the weather was nice yesterday afternoon when i came from work i spent 3 hours in the garden, weeding, hoeing, pruning and generally giving it a tidy up, by the time I'd had something to eat and a shower i was so knacker i headed up to bed at 9.30. It's true what they say, the older you get the longer it takes, lol, I woke up this morning and had to lie there a few minutes and decide what part of me ached the least, lol.No such silly antics going on today, I've got a stitchy / TV night plannedWrinkly Rubie! I really appreciate all your lovely comments and encouragements on this piece, especially when i had a mass invasion of frogs and could have cheerfully thrown it in bin, but all your kind words and lovely thoughts made me carry on, and I'm glad i did!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Because of my imminent finish there will be a give away as promised. The give away is- Plum Street Samplers charts - Rubie Owl & Stories To Live By Eve (Sorry, but blogger won't let me upload a photo of th charts!!)Now, did you notice my header photos? how is your geography? because in order to win the charts I'm going to ask you to name as many of the places/buildings (or river in one case) as you can, the person who gets the most correct wins, simple as that!If there is no outright winner then the names will be thrown into a hat and my daughter will draw a name.Please do not leave your answers on the comments page, e-mail me athydenseek61@yahoo.co.uk mention 'Rubie' in the subject lineAnd i will post the winner on August 23rd, so you have plenty of time!This is open to everyone, regardless of where you live.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I'm off to put bum to sofa and get some stitching done, hope you all have a great week :-)"},

Anyway, all that's passed, my mood has lifted and I'm stitching again and, i have proof!LHN The Merry SkaterIsn't she cute? I had done the stitching on this before we went away but finished it off into a little hanging ornie when we came home.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Next up is something that had been thrown into a corner to await reverse stitching after my inability to follow a chart.Rubie Owl                     The offending part (on the left) re-stitched, and I've finished stitching all those leaves on the tree, even though i think they have left me with a permanent twitch and the paranoia that i may have left one out or miss counted and they are all off.  Please, please do me a favour and keep me in ignorant bliss if you spy a mistake, because i ain't ripping anymore out!, lol.Here's the whole wrinkled thing so farI'm now at the mindless filling in stage, but after all the mishaps with this chart i care not a jot and shall happily, mindlessly fill in! (note, i did not say mindlessly stitch, as that's what got me in trouble last time, that and concentrating on Without a Trace instead of what i should have been doing!)Right, that's me just about caught up, but just before i go the last bit of my title -The Give Away  will be the Rubie Owl chart when I've finished with it, so stay tuned and hopefully in the next couple of weeks I'll post it up.Thanks for visiting me and have a fantastic week whatever you are up to :-) x"},

While Molly lounges in the sunshine outside, Millie, (who is much 'posher' and more refined!!) prefers my bed, she will venture out when it's cooled down, though not at night, I'd never let them out at night. That's it for this week then, we are going on holiday on Monday, to Halkidiki, just for a weeks R&R, can't wait for a dip in that pool and time lounging on a sunbed with my book and a glass of something cold:-)Until next time x"},

Having him at home these past few weeks has upset my routine, lol. Having said that i pulled out Rubie Owl last Sunday intending to devote all afternoonto her only to find i had made a mistake, a HUGE mistake, in fact 2 Huge mistakes!! first off, as soon as i put her in the hoop i noticed this -See the Rubies section? can you see any Rubies? no, because i happily went on filling in that section!! i also carried on with a full border at the bottom which should not have looked like this! Mistake #2 came to light as i was looking at my thread colours, I've been using Buttercup when the chart called for Butterscotch DOH!! Where was my mind! clearly not on my stitching!! OK, so the colour doesn't matter too much and I'm not going to change it, but i will have to take out the section and stitch the 'rubies' because that will bug the hell out of me! If I'm in the mood i may start to rip it out tonight, or i may just carry on with the leaves and do it when I'm in a better frame of mind, i has put me off a tad i can tell you, not looking forward to ripping out stitches.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On a happier note, i did have a finish the week before last but neglected to show it so here you go.Christmas Tree 'freebie' from Claire stitched on a scrap of 28 count using Threadworx 1089I added beads to the edging and i think it turned out pretty cute :-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If i can motivate myself i could get loads of stitching in over the next few weeks, the World Cup has kicked off this weekend, with England's first match tonight against the US.

{"title": "How Much Can You Fit Into One Weekend?", "date": "Wednesday 2 June 2010", "text": "We had a lovely time in London at the weekend, although Saturday it rained for most of the day by the time we went to have afternoon tea it had cleared up. This time we sampled the delights at Fortum & Mason and came out completely stuffed, lol, because I've been trying to eat more healthily it's been ages since i have eaten cake - but it was wonderful! Not such a 'dressy' place as we went to last time but that was OK. I think it's just so decadent to dress up and have afternoon tea! not something that we do very often so it feels very special.This was our little appetizer, bread sticks with cheese & pesto, salmon and some sort of pastry we couldn't quite work out what but decided it was a 'posh' sausage roll. We opted for the afternoon tea which consisted of a selection of rolls and finger sandwiches and a lovely selection of cakes, together with a glass of champagne and a pot of tea each.We had to go for a walk afterwards to work some of it off!Sunday we caught the train to Hampton Court and spent a great day out, and the weather was kind to us. I was really looking forward to this visit being a recent convert to Tudor novels and everything Henry VIII and i wasn't disappointed, If you are English you will know that usually it cost a fortune to get into these Historic places, although lovely they may be. We spent all day at Hampton Court and the admission was only about £14 absolute bargain! there was lots going on from jousting to demonstrations in the Tudor kitchens, which i must say had THE biggest fireplace i have ever seen - and it was alight. We took advantage of the headset (no extra charge) which gave us a guided tour of everything inside.Walking to the entrance of Hampton Court PalaceThe astronomical clock which is in base court & is 400 years old. This clock has been mentioned a few times in the book I'm now reading so it was nice to place it. The Grand Hall Which was lined with the most amazing tapestries   The Palace from the side showing one of the beautiful gardens.  Jenny liked the fact that it was symmetrical!This is a newer part added on by William of Orange.Apparently he wanted to knock Hampton Court down and start again!Thank goodness he didn't!Fancy having this view from your back door!On Sunday evening we had a table booked at the Ivy, this is the place to celeb spot, not much to look at from the outside is it? Very nice inside though and the food and the service was excellent, unfortunately we didn't spy any celebs :-( They have a policy of no cameras or mobile phones in the restaurant so no photos of our food!To round off our weekend we went on a walking tour of Westminster Abbey on Monday morning - if you are ever in London and thinking of doing this tour it's well worth it, our guide was great very knowledgeable, and quite funny with it. I didn't realise so many people were buried there including Henry VII, Elizabeth I & Mary Tudor (Mary & Elizabeth are buried together, strange as they were complete opposites!)So, how much can you fit into one weekend? well quite a lot it seems! I'm glad i booked yesterday off work to recover, i was, as they say, knackered!!Hope everyone had a fun Bank Holiday, thank you for stopping by and all your wonderful comments, i really do appreciate them:-)"},

My husband thinks they are boring plants, but what does he know, he just mows the grass ;-) I took these photos about a week or so ago and they are even bigger now. Last year they were plagued with snails and slugs, but this year they have been free so far, i have my defences in place, #1 defence - is copper band around the tubs, (electrocutes the little blighters if they try to climb the tub!) #2 defence - is wood pellet cat litter sprinkled around the base of the plant, (the slimy suckers can't crawl across it!) #3 defence- apparently they like cheap larger! don't laugh, it's true! poured into small containers just sunk into the soil, they party all night and you have a collection to dispose of the next morning! I haven't been idling my time away in all this sunshine, i have been stitching.LHN Winter Sheep Monthly Ornament - stitched on a scrap of 28 count even weave with DMC threads substitute was made for writing as i hadn't got that particular number.This stitched up really quickly, it probably took me longer to make it into the ornament - something i still struggle with, that's why they will all most likely be hanging pillow ornies as I'm more comfortable with that finish and the tree I'm planning on putting them on if big enough to take them.That's all for now - next week is Bank Holiday weekend so an extra day off work again (yippee!) and I'm off to London with my eldest daughter for a few days for our 'posh' weekend, afternoon tea and dinner at the Ivy restaurant mingling with celebs!! so hopefully lost to share with you next time.  In the meantime lets hope for the sun to continue to shine so we can all spend more time in the garden like this - Molly the sun worshiper - unfortunately she forgets she sports a rather heavy fur coat!Until next time x"},

{"title": "Just Another Bank Holiday Monday And It.....", "date": "Monday 3 May 2010", "text": "Was a very typical one for the UK, not very warm and ending in rain.  I knew i was being optimistic when i bought a new patio set last week, might be weeks now before we get to use it!  Being Bank Holiday we had an extra long weekend so we decided to drive out to a car boot sale and have a rummage - i love a good rummage, do you?  I was to be disappointed today though, nothing worth rummaging in, seemed like everyone was just getting out last years 'un sold's' and my only find was another Tudor book - The Queen's Sorrows, Suzannah Dunn, (yes, i know, I'm becoming obsessed!) If only I'd known how interesting the Tudors were when i was taking History at school i might have fared better than a C in my exams (or was it a D? been so long i forget!) either way it was not good.  Wednesday this week bought on another throat infection which really knocked me for six, i went into work only to come home again mid morning because i lost my voice, not a good thing when you work on a switchboard, Thursday i managed to go to work but absolutely had no life in me whatsoever and come Friday morning i woke up as a mutant with a second set of eyelids, the result of something that did not agree with me again, so instead of going to work i made a trip to the doctors. I'm to take antihistamines for a month to try and settle it down (whatever 'it' is).Anyhoo..you didn't come here to read about my ailments so how about a stitchy photo?LHN Snowy PinesDMC Threads on a mystery piece of linenI don't know what count the fabric was i used but this one came out smaller than the others, and i think now i do prefer them a little bit bigger.  I also managed another finish on my ABC, no photos until it comes back though, i was so eager to get it up to Betty's for framing i forgot.  I hadn't realised how long this one had been going until i looked back through my blog, it was last April i started it, where does the time go!! Stevie has her School Prom this Friday so a busy few days ahead being filled with hair, nail, tanning and makeup appointments.  I'm not going to sit down and tot up how much this Prom has cost, it's just a lot, an awful lot, but i am so looking forward to seeing her all dressed up, I'm sure it will be worth every last penny:-)  So, next time hopefully lots of photos of Stevie in her glad rags and my long awaited ABC finish, which incidentally i have dedicated to Stevie as it will mark some milestones in her life, she turned 16 in the week i finished it, officially left school last Friday and of course her Prom. Well that's all folks, except to say that i have added some swaps / trades and some freebies on my other blog, the link is in the sidebar if you want a wonder on over to see if anything takes your fancy...if it does, give me a shout.As always, thank you for your lovey comments which really do mean so much to me as do your continued visits to read my ramblings. x"},

It must have been something to do with the craving i had for milk when i was pregnant, i drank gallons of the stuff, not in the normal way, it had to be put in the freezer until little ice crystals formed and i would eat it with a spoon! glass after glass went in the freezer day after day, funny thing is, before i got pregnant i didn't really like milk and would never ever drink a glass, and it goes without saying that after the event i have never drunk milk!! I had a similar relationship with raw carrots, couldn't get enough of them! until i read something about carotene poisoning, i remember going to my doctors for an antenatal appointment and asking him in a panic if i was going to have an orange baby!! He laughed and said 'No, he didn't think so' (whilst giving me a look that said 'we have a right one here!')This is Stevie at about 3 or 4 months old with a rather puzzled look on her face!As you can see, i didn't have an orange baby! She is really tall though, at 5' 9\" she is way taller than most of her friendsHappy 16th Birthday Stevie!~~~~~~~~~~~~Thank you all for your kind comments on my LHN ornie and the congratulations and well wishes for my #1DD. Her passing out ceremony went well, (i have since learnt that the official name for this is an Attestation), she will be in training now for the next 17 weeks before she is let loose on catching criminals! there is lots to learn, she is getting tons of reading/homework but is loving every minute.~~~~~~~~~~~~I've given this week up to finishing my ABC and thanks to the frog hopping it and an almost all day stitching fest on Saturday I'm primed for a finish for the weekend.No stiching tonight, as we went out for a meal in honor of the Birthday Girl, but I'll be getting a numb bum on Thursday & Friday night to get that finish :-)Speak soon. x"},

I was happily stitching away yesterday afternoon on the border until i noticed that i was one stitch off, this is the offending bitI started one stitch too high, i can't ignore it because it will throw the rest off, but i was too disheartened yesterday to rip it out and started over on the other side instead, I'll take out the little blighters in a couple of days when I've got over it!Only two sections to go on this piece so I'm going to keep going this week and see if i can get done.~~~~~~~~~~~~My other exciting news to share tonight is that my eldest daughter has started her training as a Police Constable today and we will be having a 'Proud Parent Moment' tomorrow night watching her at her passing out ceremony, i can't tell you how proud we are of her, she is such a hard worker and always gives 100% in everything she does and so deserves every success :-)Right, that's me caught up for a few days, off to settle into bed with my book and a cuppa :-) Until next time xx"},
{"title": "Rubie Owl", "date": "Monday 5 April 2010", "text": "Tomorrow morning is back to work, I've had four lovely days off and since Bank Holiday weather is notoriously bad here in the UK i had nothing more energetic planned than sitting and stitching and catching on TV programmes I'd recorded. (I've become addicted to Anthea Turner's Perfect Housewife). It's on the 'Home' Channel between 1am-3am, which only goes to show how sad i am as the programme doesn't even warrant prime time viewing!! What can i say, the woman has some great cleaning and storage tips!! I've also been playing about with my blog colours, again! i can't seem to find something to stick with, these will do for now though. My header is a photo i took of the daffodils in my garden, me and my daughter planted over 200 of them last year and i am thrilled so many made it to flowering :-) They bring a lovey splash of colour to the garden even when it's raining.Anyway, here's the progress i made on Rubie Owl.I really love the way these colours jump out at you, but does anyone else have a problem with Belle Soie silks knotting? I usually work with about a yard of floss but have had to reduce this to less because of knotting.The fabric is more of a sandy colour, which is refusing to show up true in the photos. the weekend was spent stitching mostly leaves, and after a while I lost the ability to count! i must have frogged as many as I've stitched!! I need to order a couple of colours to finish off the tree, and because of the Bank Holiday they will be a few more days yet. I'm putting Rubie back in the bag this week and working on the LHN monthly ornament, He's A Flake, it feels like ages since i had a finish and this looks like it will be a quickie. Until next time, have a great week.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"},

We had a great break in Poland, apart from DH completely driving me nuts, lol, you've heard the saying 'less is more', well let me tell you, that saying definitely applies to time spent with my DH. Perhaps it's because I'm only used to his company at the weekends (and let me tell you I'm quite happy with that!) but i had forgotten how he can sulk and take offence at the smallest thing!! Oh well, i suppose we all have our crosses to bear, and he's mine, lol.While in Poland we visited Auschwitz which was something else, there really are some horrific tales from that place, and also the salt mines which was OK but not as exciting as i thought it would be. The weather was kind to us, not cold like i thought it would be, in fact when i phoned home they told me it was wet and miserable in the UK whereas Poland was basking in sunshine! I haven't managed to upload any photos of the trip yet, perhaps over the Easter break I'll have time.Saturday just gone was the Hobby Craft show at the NEC in Birmingham so i took myself off there for the day on Saturday, just me myself & I, it was heaven! here's a few stitchy goodies i bought home with me. The plastic thread keeper i bought before i came across the wooden ones, i much prefer the wood. The thread heaven i haven't used yet but have heard good reports.And because a girl can't have enough handbags, this beautiful Italian bull leather handbag found it's way home with me :-) I also treated myself to a new phone case & specs case in a funky purple colour.I bought the little charm on the bag on Saturday too. The bag was way, way (like a week of my wages expensive!!!!!) but the little charm is cheap & cheerful!I knew my DH had his good points :-) one of them being he never ever complains if i spend money, nor does he ever ask how much anything costs, just says, 'yeah nice' so he's not so bad ;-)When i was catching up on blogs last week i found out Sherry had left me my first award! Thank you so much for thinking of me Sherry. I'm supposed to pass it onto 12 bloggers but I've been looking around and most of the blogs i read have already been awarded this, so I'll cheat a little and say that if i read your blog or you are on my blog roll and have not received this award then consider yourself Sunshine awarded!Another lovely surprise was to find out that i had won a consolation prize from Felicity i shall eagerly await the post man!Well that's about it for now, you will have noticed that there are no stitchy pics, I've been stitching, honest! and to prove it an update of Rubie Owl will follow soon.

I have signed up for the Spring term classes so hopefully will have more shots to share. We've been working on Cyanotypes, a form of early printing and i was extremely pleased with my print, so pleased I'm intending on getting it framed! I'll show that over the next few weeks too Sorry to be such a tease ;-)I'm still on my health eating 'none diet' and (drum roll please) i have now lost 15Lb's.  I can't tell you how good it felt when i took a pair of size 12 jeans (UK sizing) in the changing room on Saturday and they FIT!!!  I have tried loosing weight in the past but never stuck to anything and i don't know why this time should be any different, it just has, i really think the eating breakfast at 'breakfast time' has helped.  Also not labeling it as a 'diet' has helped, i have not bought any special diet options of anything, just cut out the crap and learnt to eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm full! and obviously that's what's working for me so I'm sticking to it!Anyway, what i came here to say is that we are off on one of our little sight seeing trips again on Wednesday, Krakow in Poland this time, we will be back sometime the following Monday and if time allows i will update stitching and such after that. That's it for now, off to sort out my waterproof jacket as the weather forecast for Poland is still showing little snowflakes!! Have fun whatever you may be up to x"},

The consultant recommend taking Angus Castus which can be bought from the health food shop, it's taken in liquid form, added to water and sipped throughout the day and supposedly helps to balance out the hormones.  I'm giving it a go anyway to see if it will make a difference. so, big sign of relief and i feel much better in my mind this week :-)I enrolled on another photography course in January and thought it would be nice to show off some of my photos, sort of like Wordless Wednesday, except of course this Wednesday i haven't shut up yet, ;-)   I'd love to hear your comments and/or criticism on my efforts.

{"title": "Rubies, Diamonds & Golden Pears", "date": "Friday 19 February 2010", "text": "For the past few weeks I've been suffering with very tender 'boobs' more than usual even taking the time of the month in consideration, the doctor could feel nothing but could tell how tender i was, i went to see the consultant today who believes it's just a thickening of the breast tissue and is nothing nasty to worry about.  She suggested a scan & mammogram just to have a look see, so I'm taking advantage of the health insurance we have at work and have an appointment at a local private hospital on Monday morning.  At least my mind is a little easier now, you know how it is worrying about these things, I've just plodded through the week to be honest.  So, now I'm more 'myself' I'm ready to share some updates :-) First i finished stitching the LHN ornament Pear Tree this afternoon, in my mind when i started this SAL was going to finish them all as hanging ornaments, but this one is HUGE!! too big to be a hanging ornament (me thinks) and i don't know how to finish it..any and all suggestions will be gratefully received!I Stitched it on a scrap of 28 count and it measures 4\" x 5\" it turned out much bigger than i imagined but i do like it, i still have the beads to put on and I'm sure i had some somewhere, but at the moment can't lay my hands on them.My first new start i thought would be quicker to stitch, ha, ha, famous last words! i didn't take a very good look at the chart, there are lots of colour changes!! so this is going to be a while in the making.  Welcome Quaker Diamonds for the first of what may be many outings ;-)I may need motivation with this one so if anyone knows of a SAL or would like to get one going, do let me know.And just because i needed something that would be a little faster i started Rubie Owl, i had to wait for my LNS to get the threads in for this one, so again not too much to show. I splashed out on different fabric for this one (more expensive) I'm not going to name it because i know that lots of people love this particular linen and I'm going to stick my neck out here and say that i cannot say that i love it, it's OK, but no way does it justify the price i paid. Just my opinion ;-)Meet Rubie Owl, I've been reading more than stitching this week and have finished up another Philippa Gregory book, i started the next one, The Virgins Lover last night.  Only one more to read and then I've finished the Tudor Court series but i did read on line somewhere that her next series will be on the Plantagenet's, if they are as good as the Tudor's i can't wait!  When i was leaving the hospital on Friday there was a book sale in reception, i took a few minutes to browse and came across these for 50 pence each!I already read The Lovely Bones a few years ago but it belonged to my daughter and i would like to read it again.  I couldn't believe i found The Concubines Secret for 50p! i already have the Red Scarf (bought from Amazon) and The Russian Concubine (bought from the charity shop for 45 pence!!) so this completes the set which i plan on reading when I've finished the Tudor series, has anyone read these?  The other two i read the blurb in WH Smith some time ago and wasn't too sure about so couldn't justify spending the money on them, but at a give-away price like i gotthem at i don't mind if i don't want to keep them afterwards!Phew, i think I've about made up for my none blogging, and if you're still with me, thank you!! and if your not that's OK too ;-) I'm off to plonk my bum on the sofa and get some stitching done, have a great weekend whatever your up too :-) see ya soon xx"},
{"title": "Quaker Row All Framed Up", "date": "Thursday 4 February 2010", "text": "Hello Peeps! Thank you for all your wonderful comments on the results of my first attempt at tea bag splodging! Being the conservative type i did feel rather reckless but as i love the results, especially when i saw it framed, you can be sure I'll be trying it again :-)I picked Quaker Row up this afternoon, and once again Sharon & Mark at 'Betty's' did a great job!As I've been plagued with a migraine for the last couple of days not much stitching has been done, two days running i had to come back from work and go to bed for a few hours, thankfully this afternoon i have finally got a clear head, such a great feeling after migraine pain.********************I finally got myself organised enough to have a sort out and decided to start a 'swap / trade' blog if you want to have a wander over the link is in the right side bar, I've put some charts up for now but i have loads of magazines that i will be sorting through over the next couple of  weeks and adding too, and I'm certain there are other charts lurking somewhere.  I've added some wishes, likes & dislikes too.********************For my birthday at Christmas amongst other things my eldest daughter bought me Quaker Diamonds with the required Valdani threads and i made this my new start last weekend, this is not going to be a 'quick stitch' and i haven't made enough progress to show, I'll share it next week when I've been able to fit more stitchy time in.********************I'm thrilled that so many of you enjoy Philippa Gregory books too, I'm getting blank looks when i mention them at work and a sort of wrinkling of the nose when i say they are about the Tudors.  I seem to be on a bit of a history fest at the moment and was chuffed to bits today when i came across two books in the charity shop, 'Elizabeth The Great' by Elizabeth Jenkins about Elizabeth I and 'Mary Tudor' by H.F.M Prescott, about Katherine of Aragon's daughter, Mary.They both look brand new and a bargain at 90pence each!I'm behind on my blog commenting because of the 'head thing' but i will get to you all this weekend to see what wonderful things you have been up to :-) Until next time xx"},
{"title": "Quaker Finish", "date": "Wednesday 27 January 2010", "text": "Greetings Peeps :-) first up is my second finish this year, finished within a month, i can't believe that i finished something so quickly, but here's the proof. You may recall that i wasn't too sure of the thread colour, it has grown on me and i had several comments saying that you liked it so it stayed. As i put the last stitch in yesterday evening i spread it out on the table to admire (and pick faults with, as you do!). I can't say that i immediately loved it but then i had an idea, now I'm not good with original ideas and i don't mind saying that i nicked this one!! i had read on Siobhan's blog that she had aged her her stitching of 'semi naked' people by rubbing with wet coffee grounds. We only have instant coffee in this house I'm afraid, but off i went and make a strong cup of coffee and a cup of tea and mixed the two together, squeezed out the tea bag and dunked it in the cocktail, squeezed again took a deep breath and rubbed it on my stitching - this is a closer look at the effect.What do ya think? I'm loving it!! I just went to have another peek at it when i came in and i defiantly think it's improved the piece, so i want to say a big \"Thank You\" to Siobhan for her post which gave me the courage to try my own ageing process! It'll be the weekend before i can get it to the framers now and I'll share another piccy with you when i get it back.~~~~~~~~~~~~~Four of us girls at work have got together to participate in a healthy eating/fitness plan and today was our second weigh in, two girls stayed the same, one lost 2lb but i am so pleased to say that i have lost 5lb. Remember i said it was one of my goals to loose some weight this year? this weight loss is just the result of me not eating crap, no chocolate, no cake, (tell a lie, I've had one egg custard!) and the one that i think has helped most I've started to eat breakfast as soon as i get to work at 8.30 (can't face anything any earlier) and I'm sure it has curbed my hunger. I'll let you know if there is less of me here again towards the end of February.~~~~~~~~~~~~~I've put a reading / read list in my side bar now as i discovered a 'new to me' author just before Christmas - Philippa Gregory, I'm so enjoying reading these historical novels of hers that i ordered all of them off Amazon, I'm finding she really brings the characters such as Anne Boleyn (what a naughty girl she was!!) her sister Mary Boleyn (what a tart!!!, lol) and Katherine of Aragon to life. If you've read any of her other novels I'd love to know if you enjoyed them.And finally, i have a blogging question, I've tried to add more blogs to the ones i read but blogger won't put them on my list, anyone know why? is there a limit to the number you can put on i wonder?Thank you for all the lovely comments you take the time to leave, they are wonderful and very much appreciated x..till next time xx"},
{"title": "New Start, Snow & Daft Cats!", "date": "Wednesday 13 January 2010", "text": "School was out again today because of snow over night so Stevie had yet another day of sledding. Last night was only about the 2nd time I've parked in our street in a week because of the weather, just my luck, i managed to inch my way down this morning, sliding the last bit, luckily there were no parked cars for me to hit towards the bottom of the road! The main roads weren't much better, I'm sure the gritters haven't been in our parts. This afternoon after work i left my car out of the street again, just in case!I know this is a pathetic amount of snow compared to other countries but believe me, even this amount causes havoc in the UK, we are just not used to it and don't have the resources to cope with it, no snow ploughs and we are running out of salt and grit!~~~~~~~~~~When i was uploading some photos i remembered that i hadn't shared my framed Zippity-do-da with you, so here you go. Hard to get a photo of all of it with my small camera, but you get the idea, the frame i chose in the end was a white-ish distressed one which matched Stevie's room.~~~~~~~~~~My new start for 2010 was actually started on Boxing DayQuaker Row by Midnight StitchingI'm stitching on 28 count with Threadworx 10342. Still not really sure about the colour but it's staying put now! I just realised that i haven't quite finished the squirrel stitching. (does anyone else think that squirrel looks a little crazy?)~~~~~~~~~~Finally, this is my snow cat, molly, insisting on going out to catch snow flakesShe didn't wander too far from the door though i can tell you! That's it for now, except to thank every one for their lovely comments on my last post and Fa-La-La, even though the stitching caused me so much greif i'm glad i stuck with it now, it's still sitting on the mantle in my bedroom just to remind me, and i did get the beads up of the floor, well, most of them anyway :-)"},
{"title": "New Years Day Finish", "date": "Friday 1 January 2010", "text": "Happy New Year! The first morning of the new decade was a frosty one here in my part of the UK, we were promised snow a few days back, but it never arrived, am i the only one who was disappointed??,lol. Looking back over December it was, (as it is every year) a very busy time in this house, we have celebrated 5 birthdays and a wedding anniversary since the beginning of the month, starting off with my Niece on 1st December quickly followed by my DD#2 who turned 22 on the 2nd, my DD#1 turned 27 on 22nd, little ole me celebrated (not sure that's the right word) my 48th birthday on 27th! and my brother turned 55 on 28th (omg, my family is getting old, lol) and just to add a bit of variety it was my wedding anniversary on 20th, what ever possessed us to get married so close to Christmas i do not know!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I'm not a fan of making New Year resolutions, but this year i am setting myself some goals, the first of which is to have a healthier lifestyle and get fitter, notice i didn't say the dreaded 'diet' word, i have in the past rushed to join Weight Watchers or Slimming World in January only to have my interest wain by February, so this year I'm doing neither, i know what i need to do in order for the scales to go down, eat less crap and take more exercise! i just need to put it into practice and I've already started on the second one (come on its Christmas, I'm allowed to eat some crap for now!) so to combat some of that Christmas food I've been going for a brisk walk everyday over the holiday, it's a start and I'm not looking for any 'quick fixes' this year, it's taken me 4 years to put on this extra weight so I'm being realistic this time that it will take me a while to shift it! My aim is to loose 18lb, that will make me just 7lb heavier than i was 4 years ago, (I'm older now so i figure that i need some fat to help plump the wrinkles out! I'll post my progress here more for me to keep track, but i wont bore you with it at every post, promise :-) So, here is my very first finish of 2010 and I'd like it to be known that more than once it was flung to the other side of the room in utter frustration and very nearly consigned to the kitchen bin on several occasions! i don't know what happened, i must have lost brain cells or something with all the lounging around over the holidays, Christmas may be over but this is staying where i can look at it and show it to everyone who will look, lol. LHN, Fa-La-La on 28 count with DMC threadsI added beads around the edge and finished it off with red organza ribbon, the beads were a first for me, and boy did i make a mess with them! I want to thank you for visiting me in 2009 and i hope that you will continue to do so in 2010, i look forward to visiting all your blogs and seeing all the wonderful work you do, i love to read the comments you leave for me here, they truly make my day :-) Have a fantastic New Year, I'm going to finish off the first day of the new decade by picking all those dropped beads off the carpet, lol...wish me luck (or i may just get the vacuum out!)"},

I finished work this afternoon and can now look forward to 12 lie-ins, lol, no alarm going off at 7am, nothing to rush for in the mornings, bliss :-) It seems ages since i had any stitching to show but I'm hoping to get plenty of stitching time in and maybe finish off a couple of ornaments over the holiday so i will be able to prove that i do still stitch, lol.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here in my part of the UK we are still experiencing quite a cold spell, we had a dusting of snow last weekend which amazingly is still with us, which just goes to show that the temperature has not been above freezing the whole week, i know that in some part of the world that's not unusual, after all it is December, but for us in the UK it is rare! I must say that i much prefer this cold, crisp weather, give me this over rain any day! We may, fingers crossed be in for a white Christmas after all, it's been snowing a little again this afternoon so lets hope so. That's it from me this side of Christmas, i will be another year older the next time we speak :-0Till then, have a very Merry ChristmasAnd may Santa be very kind to you all. xxx"},
{"title": "Beatrix Part 2 & a Stinking Cold!", "date": "Tuesday 8 December 2009", "text": "I didn't mean to leave it so long before posting the rest of the photos of our weekend break. Much to the amusement and relief may i add of my DH, i woke up on Sunday morning to find i had lost my voice in the night, the rest of this week i have been battling a stinking cold and coming in from work at lunch time just to go straight off to bed for a couple of hours. Finally tonight i think the worst is over, thank goodness. Anyway, here are the promised pics - first up are some i took of Windermere, very pretty village and it was nice enough on the Saturday for us to go on a boat trip on Windermere itself, although by the end of the trip we were both chilled to the bone lol.Love these houses right on the edge, but apparently this area was quite badly flooded the week before, you can still see that the water is quite high This is looking towards the town Taken while we were on the boat trip, the little orange boat caught my eye and you can just make out the snow on the hills in the backgroundI love the next 2 photos, it looks so peaceful, don't you think? This is the entrance to the garden of Beatrix Potter's house, Hill Top. The garden is still set out as a very cute veggie garden And this is Hill Top, looking every bit the English cottage This was taken from the gardenSome bits & bobs in the garden The path leading up to Hill Top, you reach this via the shop, which was open but unfortunately the house closes to the public from November 1st - a good excuse for another visit another time!I remember reading somewhere that when Beatrix P died there was a stipulation in her will that no one should live in Hill Top after her death so i assume that her furnishings are still there, pity we went so late in the year i would have like to have seen inside. A few weeks ago you will remember that in the UK we were having lots of rain and there was major flooding in many parts (including the Lake District), below is the sort of weather we had to drive home in.Good job DH was driving, the motorway was like this until we almost reached home and I'm sorry to say that we have still had much of the same horrible damp weather since!Because of my stinking cold and fear of stabbing myself with the needle every time i sneeze and the fact that i could not see through my streaming eyes, there hasn't been much stitching time this week. Before the bugs attacked me i did finish off another Santa and picked Zippity up from the framers, but i show you those next time.Thanks for stopping by and all your lovely comments, i really do appreciate them:-)See ya next time x"},
{"title": "Beatrix Potter", "date": "Monday 30 November 2009", "text": "I've been MIA yet again, busy stitching away on Santa's but not this weekend. This weekend i was 'Living the Dream as Seen on Screen' For those who do not know, this is a UK TV programme dedicated to showing us how the other half live in houses that have been used in film or TV. The house we stayed in now belongs to the National Trust but was once owned by Beatrix Potter and was the very house that was used in the Miss Potter film!!If you re familiar with the film you will recognise this porch. Can you see just on the floor they have still left the slate Hill Top name plaque?Hill Top house in the Lake District was the first house that Beatrix Potter bought with earnings from her books and she did live there. When it came to making the film Hill Top was totally impractical for filming and a search was made to find somewhere suitable. Yew Tree Farm was chosen for the job and it was here that we stayed this weekend.Yew Tree Farm in Coniston was owned by Beatrix Potter, she bought it when the National Trust could not afford too as she did with many, many properties in the lake District, she eventually sold them back to the National Trust when they could afford to buy. She helped set up tea rooms at Yew Tree Farm and she picked out the furnishing and bought them with her own money.Isn't it the most idyllic looking place you could imagine?On Saturday morning when we got up there was snow on the hills, making it even more picturesque, if that's possible! This is the view from the dining room, taken on Sunday morning when it was teaming down with rain and impossible to take more photos outside. A view of the dining room through the mirror. This is where the furnishing that she chose now live. It's very cosy, there are just 3 tables as there are just 3 room to let here, the log fire was lit for us in the morning. Can you see the lovely dresser with the plates and the corner cabinet? So lovely!There was a gorgeous sitting room, again the log fire was lit for us and a bottle of port sitting on the window to help yourselves to (yes i did partake in a glass!!)Lovely panelled wall and leather Chesterfield Cosy corner with local magazines to browse and a collection of old books, there was gentle music playing in the background too, not a TV in sight...bliss! Warm fire, just what you need on a chilly night another view of the sitting room, how cute is that little window! The next few photos are not the best but i had trouble with the light.Now i now where the saying 'Up The Wooden Hills' comes from, the house had lovely wooden stairs and panelled walls leading up to the bedrooms. Our bedroom was call the Tarn Hows room and was just lovely, there were 2 windows like this, one on each side of the room. And a fabulous four poster bed The door way you can see on the other side of the room leads to the bathroom, the doorway was very low and there was a sign above saying 'please mind your head' but guess who banged his head at least 3 times? yes DH has a sore head to go back to work with!!I have just too many photos to show in one post so I'll show more next time of Hill Top and our boat trip on Windermere. If you want to click here to visit Yew Tree Farm website and have a browse, there is a bit on there about the filming of Miss Potter and how Yew Tree Farm came to be chosen to portray Hill Top.In the meantime, i have one more day holiday from work tomorrow so will be having a lie-in tomorrow and plan on some sitting and stitching..Until next time x"},

I've been full of good intentions but something always gets in the way. Last week i tried my hand at scrap booking, a completely new thing for me but my friend who is into scrap booking in a BIG way asked me to go to her crop as they were having a 'taster' session, all i was to bring along was a 6x4 photo and £1 for materials. I thoroughly enjoyed the night and my friend gifted me with a scrapbook to put my first page in:-) We got the chance to try our hand at stamping, (the bird & the flower thingies) and the little frilled edge under the photo was done with a cool little tool that did the frilly bit  for you!. I dread to think how much could be spent on this hobby and I'm a little reluctant to go down that road, but it did make a really pleasant change.  Stitching has been a bit hit and miss, most nights i really haven't felt like getting anything out. This is my pathetic progress on my ABCI think the roses motif is the only section I've finished since i last showed itI think perhaps i am getting a bit fed-up with the same old, same old, so to try and get back a little enthusiasm i made a new start yesterday - on this I've had this ready to do for a while now and it seems to be stitching up quickly (famous last words, lol) no photos today though, I'll show next time.My photo class is going well, really enjoying it so far, i was a bit worried i was going to be stuck with a load of men, but only 2 men in the class the rest are a mixed age range of women, all it seems with more or less the same objective, to become a brilliant photographer and earn loads of money, lol. I will try and get around to posting my photos somewhere so you can all have a good laugh for next time, but i took this today in my garden, trying to bring together what we have covered up to nowThanks for stopping by & have a great week whatever you may be up too x"},

This is also on 28 count, with Anchor threads 1013 & 1014. Please excuse the slightly washed out photos!

It has a small mark on the fabric at the bottom, not too noticeable but i know it's there therefore will always notice it! As the threads are not colourfast i cannot wash it, i have some carpet & upholstery wipes I'm going to try later and hope that works. and then i can take it to the framers in the week. This past week I've spent my afternoons after work in the garden because the weather here has been absolutely beautiful every day, I've chopped & trimmed everything in sight, lol and it now looks so much better, most of the bushes we planted had somehow taken on a life of their own, it was like The Day of The Triffids in parts!The right hand side on the corner there was a huge bush which although lovely when it was in flower had gotten just too big, all that's left now is the trunk of it and i have filled that area with daffodil bulbs and covered it in bark, so hopefully i shall have a lovely display next spring :-) I've planted up my hanging baskets and window boxes with winter pansies too.Now I've got the garden in order i shall hopefully be able to get some stitching in next week although i have to finish off my Power Point for the  I.T NVQ I'm doing at work because the assessor is visiting the week after and i really want to get it out of the way (the assessor has been a bit of a nightmare from the beginning).  Talking of work, we have had a series of shock redundancies. Back in April when we had the end of year review we were told that although things were tight (like most companies i suppose) they were going to save money through things like cutting back on spending, tighter reigns on expenses and there would be no spending on company fun days, but they were not going to make redundancies.  Well that was then! so far, one of the girls has gone from Sales and one of the service engineers, then a week ago 8 of the design and CAD lads had letters and they made the decision this week to make two of them redundant, one of them was past retirement age anyway but the other one was a young lad, he and his wife have a young baby, it was him i felt most sorry for, he got upset when he was saying his good byes, i hate it when people get upset and could have cried with him!!  We don't know if there will be any more, they never even announced these last ones!  It's all made worse because all the lads are a really great bunch and everyone gets along, but i suppose with the economy being they way it is it can't be helped.Thank you all for visiting and all your lovely comments, it makes my day to read them and visit all your lovely blogs :-)  Have a lovely week whatever your getting up to.  x"},

Below is looking right and towards the sea, although i think it is just about out of view from here.Although i didn't stitch as often as i would have done at home i did make some progress on MWThe majority of part 2 is complete, although that little critter caused me some trouble! i think i stitched him 3 times before i got him right! the little mystery motif above the squirrel kept us guessing, lol, to my mind now it's stitched it looks like a turtle with something in it's mouth, Stevie thinks it looks like a (tiny) camel, lol. From this photos it just looks like a splodge! I'll take a better one next time and you can see. I'll save some photos for my next post and just leave you with a couple of Stevie-Leigh for now.These two were taken at the harbour in Paphosand eating out one night.I have been reading your blogs while I've been away but didn't get around to commenting, I'll catch up with you all this week, have a wonderful week and thank you for all your lovely comments, they are truly appreciated :-)"},
{"title": "I'm Goin Where The Sun Keeps Shining!", "date": "Sunday 9 August 2009", "text": "I'm so behind with blogging & blog reading, i had every intention but the last few weeks just haven't been flowing right for me, i seem to be continually on catch up mode and have been generally out of sorts with most things, it happens sometimes though i suppose we all get fed up! I really had my heart set on finishing AT this week and at the framers this weekend but that just didn't happen, how can such a small amount of stitching take so long, i swear the chart was growing the more i stitched! As for Mary, well she was abandoned this week in favour of AT, but because i neglected her I'm taking her on holiday with me (hence the title of the post lol) she is as i type sitting in my suit case ready to travel. this is where i got to, page one all finished.A couple of people wanted to know what threads I'm using, well it's good old DMC, 3777, 839 & 840. I'm stitching on 18 count with one thread.  It's a bit strange stitching with one thread but I'm slowly getting used to it. So it's off to Cyprus for me & Stevie this morning, it was a bit of a last minute thing, only booked it last week, our flight is at 9am, we are staying at mother & father in laws for 2 weeks!  Mark isn't coming with us this time, he won't be able to have time off now until the end of October so it's just a girly thing this time.  I will have Internet access while I'm away so may try and catch up a bit in the next 2 weeks.Right, I'm off, we have to be out the house by 6.30, see you all after the 23rd, have a great weekend / week whatever you are up to and thank you all for your lovely comments, i really do appreciate them :-)"},
{"title": "A Win, The Eagles & Mary Wigham", "date": "Tuesday 14 July 2009", "text": "A few weeks ago Ginnie (Jayne) held a blogoversary give away, and guess who won :-) As a rule i don't win anything so it must have been my turn :-) The funny thing is that Jayne lives just a few miles away from me! and for her daughter to draw my name out of entries from far flung places was amazing. This is what the postie bought on Saturday morning . Bent Creek's Summer Basket which she made into a cute little hanging ornament , thank you Jayne, it is now sitting in my fairy light sticks :-)Last Wednesday was the Eagles concert, it was a good job Mark checked the tickets because I'd been telling him it was at the NEC and it was at the NIA!!! same sort of venue but in a completely different part of Birmingham, lol. It was better really, the NIA is a bit smaller and the acoustics are better. We were actually sitting in the gods we couldn't have been any higher up, but it made for a great view and considering they are pensioners (or almost!!!) they were brilliant! I hadn't played the 'Long Road Out of Eden' CD more than once before we went, now it's my new favourite CD :-) After much browsing of all the Mary Wigham's out there i finally made a start, but not with the threads that i bought on my visit to The Nimble Thimble a few weeks ago, I've gone for something completely different - well a girl's allowed to change her mind isn't she ;-)I came across this colour combination from one of the Ladies across the channel and thought how well it would go in my house so I'm afraid i am guilty of plagiarism, lol.  I have no idea what DMC numbers they used so i just went in search of 2 browns and a red (ish), I'm really pleased with the way it's looking at the moment.  There is one thing that's worrying me though, if your stitching this are you correcting the mistakes and making it symmetrical? or are you stitching it as it comes?  I'm a bit scared of making changes,  so mine will probably be stitched as it comes, or it will for now anyway :-)  Right, I'm off because Mary is calling from the corner of the sitting room, your visits and comments are much appreciated so thank for stopping by :-)Till next time - Tara-a-bit x"},
{"title": "Chart Is Ready For The Off - Names Sorted", "date": "Saturday 4 July 2009", "text": "Thank you for all the lovely comments left on my last post :-) It's now time to pass on this Simply Live chart, i will enjoy seeing it travel around and all the lovely stitching, amazingly it's only visiting 1 person from the UK!I put all the names in the Randomizer and this is the order it came back with:-1) Cindy2) Mylene 3)Kathy4)Eliza5)Loraine6)Lena7)Gillie8)Karan Congratulations Cindy, your first up to stitch! the chart will be winging it's way to you on Monday - Karan, as you are last on the list to stitch and i have no further use for the chart you will get to keep it when it reaches you! I will e-mail everyone early next week with addresses and what not, in the meantime i have put a list in the side bar of the order of stitching so we can keep track - If when you have stitched you could e-mail (or leave a message on here) that it's ready to go to the next person and i can update the list in the side bar :-) The list of names above should be clickable.Remember the quiet week i was looking forward to with Mark being away? well the best laid plans and all that! my bum has hardly touched the seat to do any stitching, lol. I had to pick Stevie up from school at lunch time on Tuesday, she had been having pains down her right side, they recommended taking her to the docs, which i did, the doctors then sent us to hospital to get her checked out for appendicitis!! I'm happy to say that i was not appendicitis but they kept her in over night so they could give her a scan on Wednesday (the doctor explained that sometimes girls of her age can get small cysts on the ovaries that can cause some pain and the scan would tell us) If she stayed in overnight she would get a scan next day as an in patient, if she went home she may have to wait up to a week for a scan. Of course we opted for her to stay in overnight to get it over with, we waited all day on Wednesday but by 4pm we were told there was such a back-log of scans that she wouldn't be done that day after all! (none of the 4 young girls on that ward were done either!) So we were told she could come home, she still had a bit of pain, but not too much. We are having to wait for a letter now booking her an appointment for the scan, which will end up being about a week later anyway! She has been fine since, isn't that just the way.I had one of Marks bosses at my door on Monday Night desperately trying to get in touch with him, he had a job that he wanted him to start the week he comes back and to go to a meeting in London this Monday and Marks phone wasn't set up to receive calls abroad. I felt such an idiot, i didn't even have his parents phone number in Cyprus, how bad that must have sounded! they are all on Marks mobile and i never thought to write it down before he went, he was going to phone me everyday as it's cheaper to make calls from there to here. I ended up going to his sisters house and getting the number off her at 9pm on that night, and no, i didn't have her number either! Marks family are not ones for keeping in touch with each other, lol.Hopefully next week i will not be playing catch up all week and will be able to get some stitching time in. Me and the girls are going for lunch tomorrow and i will be meeting Mark at the airport tomorrow evening. The only other thing i have planned for next week is a concert on Wednesday at the NEC near Birmingham to see the Eagles, how cool is that!, i can't wait! we've had the tickets for ages and they cost an arm and a leg, so they had better be good, lol. I shall let you know next time, for now I'm off to stitch!Thanks for visiting, take care - Tara-a-bit x"},

I was a bit fed-up with sitting in so yesterday Mark took me a ride out to visit the Nimble Thimble Nr Oswestry, it was quite a jaunt but the journey is through beautiful countryside. Unfortunatly i didn't take my camera, i wish i had then i could have shown you how beautiful and green everything was.The shop is not really in a town, it's in a setting with some other crafty like units, well more like log cabins really, on the edge of a village, in fact we could see no shops in the village at all, it was just outside a place called Knockin which had a little shop called The Knockin Shop!...well what else could you call it, lol.I had a good old rumage around and came back with a couple of charts, The Weathered Garden, Bent Creek and one called Five Cats & a Canary from M Designs, which i'd never heard of but was quite cute!I also ordered Cirque des Triangles which i first came across on Sandra's blog, hers looks fantastic in red, (i may steal your colours for this one Sandra, lol.) when i get around to it.The world and his wife seem to be starting Mary Wigham and i don't know weather to jump on the band wagon or not. What i won't be doing is stitching it on 32 count as i wouldn't be able to see the holes lol, so we'll see what else i can come up with. In the mean time i did buy the threads, i'm a couple short, but they will be following with my Cirque des Triangles next week.The sun was shining lovely here but as i type i can now hear thunder rolling in! so looks like running to get the washing in before the rain starts!I've got a lovely quiet week ahead as Mark is off to Cyprus tomorrow morning to stay with his mum & Dad for a week, so that means i can spread out in the bed and no need to wear ear plugs at night, and whatever we fancy for tea, yayyyyy! Whatever gave you the impression i'm looking forward to next week!!Until next time Tara-a-bit x"},
{"title": "A Day at The Hospital", "date": "Wednesday 24 June 2009", "text": "Thank you to those who wished me well with my hospital appointment today, it was very much appreciated as i was a bit apprehensive, mainly thinking of where they were going to put the camera :-o Apparently i have a polyp, which has been causing my body to do strange things each month, (ladies you know what I'm talking about here, lol).   My daughter found it very funny last night that i was shaving my legs (along with.... ahem, other bits) and slapping cream onto my feet! The reason behind which was that they would be 'on show' while i was out cold in the theatre, Joanne was quick to remind me that \"they're not going to be looking at your feet and legs mother!\" at least i was knocked out with the knowledge that i was smooth footed and hair free :-) Anyway, i feel fine, went to the theatre at 10am and was back on the ward by 11am, they even fed me while i was there!, shepherds pie, roast potatoes & veg with apple sponge & custard to follow!, I've been in as a day case before and only ever got a slice of toast, so i was pleasantly surprised. To pass the time i finished reading Stephanie Meyer's New Moon, I'm still not altogether sure about these books, i enjoyed it & Twilight but I'm not completely sold, yet. There is a bit too much waffling at times, that said i do intend to finish the series.~~~~~~~~~~Right now I'm off to watch what is left of afternoon TV and stitch on my ABC which has been neglected in favour of Simply Live the last couple of weeks. Speaking of which, thank you Karen & Kathy for e-mailing your addresses for the Travelling Pattern, if anyone else is still interested in this you can read all about it in my last post.~~~~~~~~~~I'll leave you with a photo of my ABC, hopefully i will get lots more done on this over the next couple of days as i have the rest of the week off work :-)Friday will be a happy dance day as my Simply Live will be back from the framers :-) so till then, happy stitching & take care...Tara-a-bit xEdited Note: should have mentioned that the polyp was removed and so everything should settle back to normal, the camera is so they can have a proper look around and take a sample to analyse. I won't have to have any further treatment."},

I will be all stitched up by tomorrow, it's been a joy to stitch and I'm glad that i can pass it around to you guys - I'm sure you'll love stitching it as much as i have!We have 9 girlies who wanted to play, they are:Eliza - Take One Stitch At A TimeSherry - Blog ItMylene - Mylene's BlogKaren - Karen's Craft CornerKathy - Kathy's stitching and Other ramblingsLoraine - Sew Be itCindy F - Lonestar Stitching and her RamblingsGillie - Random Thoughts From AbroadJane in WV - Who signed Anonymous, so I'm guessing no blog?So, this is how i see it working - i will draw a list up of everyone who wants to stitch SL and put the names through the Randomizer, i will then mail it to the first person on the list who will then (when they have stitched it, obviously!) send it onto the next person on the list and so on until everyone has stitched it! As Gillie pointed out, wouldn't it be great if we could travel with the chart too! oh how i wish, LOL!If you still want to be in the game can you either leave a comment with your e-mail address so i can get in touch with you, or you can e-mail me (address in the side bar) with your snail mail address using Simply Live in the subject line. Please can i ask that you give me a week to get back to you, i have to go into hospital on Wednesday for a small procedure (nothing to worry about) but i am having a general anesthetic so will be sort of out of it for a couple of days! But i do get the rest of the week of work, Yayyyy!!! I think i should be sufficiently rested up by next Sunday so i will post the order of the names then.Till then - Tara-a-Bit x"},

I must have been hibernating because i missed the release of the book too! Anyway, Intrigued i put the film on my Blockbuster rental list and joined the rest of the world! I was not impressed, it was OK, i thought it started slow, it did get better but i was left wondering what it was all about.  I know some of you will be reading this and thinking \"stupid woman, doesn't know what she's talking about\" (or something to that effect!) but let me redeem myself now - i have almost finished the book and i am loving it ! it's the best thing I've read in ages! I guess I'm better at suspending my disbelief with my nose in a book.~~~~~~~~~~~~Between vampires I've finished part 6 of AT - the section on the left of the beasties.This has been put away now until the beginning of July when the next installment is due out, so i have been working on Live Simply the last couple of nights, this is my progress.A few people expressed a liking for this chart, so i was thinking, (i do sometimes, honest!) would anyone out there be interested if i started a traveling pattern??  It would be fun don't you think to see how far this chart could travel!

{"title": "Days Out & New Starts", "date": "Friday 29 May 2009", "text": "My week off work has finished, it will be back to being awakened by the alarm in the morning, i could so get used to getting up when i feel like it and pottering around the house, and the weather have been very good to me too. i don't do sitting in the garden really, much prefer there to be a pool i can dip into to cool off when it gets a bit much. On Monday we went to Blenheim Palace, which as you probably know is the birth place of Sir Winston Churchill, and a very impressive building. How about this for a back garden! don't think I'd fancy the job of mowing and edging though! Capability Brown designed the gardens, which are huge and very beautiful. We didn't look round them all, this is the water garden. And i was dead jealous of the Hostas in the Secret Garden - they were HUGE!Inside the rooms were very large, as you would expect, no photographs were allowed (why i don;t know) i usually get around this by disarming the flash and holding my camera in front of me then no one can tell! best not to share those photos though, i don't want to get done for breech of copyright! We were able to exchange our 1 day pass for a 12 month pass on the day we went so we will definitely try and go back again - I'd love to go again at Christmas time and see the rooms decorated.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I've been getting lots of stitching time in this week too, usually i only stitch in the evenings but I've been parking my butt down in the afternoon and getting a few hours in! I made good progress on my ABC, which I'll show you next time, this time i wanted to show you my new start. i bought this when i went to the Craft show at the NEC in March The Primitive Needle -Live SimplyI'm using 28 count with Gentle Art threads - I'm loving the way the threads are giving it a faded subtle look & I'm surprised at how fast it's stitching up. I now have 4 WIP's, and this from the woman who not so long ago said that she couldn't cope with more than one project at a time! I blame you lot out there leading me astray, LOL.  The next part of AT has been released so I'll be working on that for a few days next week.  Hope you all have a great week, the sun is shining beautifully again here but i am going to sit in the cool of my sitting room and stitch, i may venture out into the garden later with the hosepipe and give everything a good dousing.

{"title": "Phew! What a Scorcher!!", "date": "Sunday 24 May 2009", "text": "I think we finally have a taste of summer here in the Midlands, it's scorching!! but shhhhhh, i don't think the sun is aware that it' Bank Holiday weekend, so lets not say anymore in case it changes it's mind!!I didn't see too much of the big round yellow thing in the sky yesterday except through the window, i was painting my daughters room all day, didn't come up for air until around 6.30 and was in bed for 10.00, knackered! Mark picked up all her stuff from uni yesterday, it's all now in boxes in the cellar waiting to be sorted. she has come home earlier than planned that's why we've had the rush with the bedroom, she had a falling out with one of the girls that she shared with at uni, I'm not sure what exactly happened, and to be honest, i haven't gone into it in great depth.   Sorry if i sound a bit un sympathetic, I'm not, it's just that Joanne is a bit of a drama queen and i don't want to get involved in the argument, they are adults after all, Joanne is 21 and the other girl is 22 or 23, so big enough to not have school girl fallings out - you would think!The last 2 weeks I've redecorated 2 bedrooms and i can tell you i ache in places i didn't even know i had! Do you ever wonder how one family can accumulate so much stuff?? I'm through with hording, so the local charity shop is going to get some new stock in the next couple of days!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I have managed so stitching in amongst the chaos that has been my house this week - This is AT with part#5I love working on this piece! part 6 is due out around the 1st of June i think. I was in a slight panic about the threads but i'm happy to report that i have gotten my eager little mits on 3 more skeins from Sew and So.  I had to wait a couple of weeks, it seemed that as fast as this colour came in it was delivered out in back orders, obviously I'm not the only one in love with Bleeding Hearts 1089!! I can see no difference in the shade either now that Threadworx have taken over NN, good job! as much as i love this piece i don't think i could have gone back to the start!I've also finished part 2 of the ABC SAl - this is how that's looking.It's not a great photo, it looks as though there is a staining on the fabric, there's not, i think it just must be shadow from the thread.  I think there have been 6 parts released for this one now so I'm going to be way behind on the finish.Thank you for all the lovely comments on my Paris photos in my last post, i've still yet to make a album of the others, i may get around to it this week as i have the week off work Yayyyyyy!! so looking forward to that, a whole week at home to just please myself!

{"title": "Bonjour Mes Aimees", "date": "Sunday 10 May 2009", "text": "Don't panic I'm not about to start speaking French, anyhow from what i remember of my school taught French i would be hard pressed to utter a complete sentence let alone write it down!, how embarrassing is it when us in the UK visit France and have to resort to asking people on the street if they speak English? very i can tell you! and the reason i know this is i have just come back from a visit to Paris! It was Joanne's 21st birthday in December so this was her belated present from us, Mark stayed at home with Stevie, so it was Joanne, Jenny & me who hit Paris on May 1st.We did all the usually touristy things, first on the list was the Eiffel Tower, Joanne was a bit disappointed because it was a brownish colour and not the silver colour she was expecting! The ques to go up were stupid so we didn't bother, just had a walk around and took quite a lot of photos.  This is what Joanne meant by the colour, i don't think it looked too bad, if you look close though you can see green netting, there was work of some sort going on, maybe that's why the ques were so long.  We walked up the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe, i didn't realise that you could actually go to the top until we got there, you have to climb a billion steps though. OK slight exaggeration but by the time i reached the top it felt like it! Well worth it though for the view of Paris.  The Sacre Coeur was well worth a visit, the church is the second highest point after the Eiffel Tower and yet again there were more steps to climb to get to the church, my legs and bum have not had this good a work out since i stopped going to the gym!  You can also climb to the top of the dome, 300 steps!! and yes i did do that too! Again, great views and worth the pain!~~~~~~~~~~~~We had to que to get inside Notre Dame and i must say that i was not blown away by the inside. It seems that you can climb to the top of all the buildings in Paris and this one's no different, however i didn't feel inclined to join the que this time so can't tell you what there was to see. there were several beggars around this area too; 2 women on either door of the church, one approached us while we were queuing, others were around the bridges. The famous Moulin Rouge, it would have been nice to see a show but at €150 a ticket we gave it a miss! Something else that i didn't realise was that all along this strip there were lots of adult shops, if you know what i mean ;-) But not in a tacky way, they were just there. And just to put a face to a name this is moi outside the Louvre. This is Joanne picking said pyramid up.   There were these little stands all around and we could only think that they had been placed there for people like us to pose for silly photos like this!And Jenny doing this!Back to a full week at work tomorrow, only did two days last week so that will be shock to the system, plus i will have to get the bus a couple of days while my car is in the garage, it failed the MOT and has to have some work done, nothing major but i hate the inconvenience of  not having a car to jump in.  I have a dental appointment on Wednesday too, the dentist was able to save the tooth i broke and is fitting a crown which i am expecting to be diamond encrusted going by what I'm having to pay for it!  Hope you all have a good week whatever you may be up to, thanks for stopping by, Tara-a-bit"},
{"title": "Everythings Coming Up Hostas!", "date": "Sunday 26 April 2009", "text": "Well at least in my garden! I love these plants, i have two fairly large variegated ones planted in the garden and 3 containers, i managed to pick up some of the dark green ones at the farmers market last week, someone was selling them for a £1 each, bargain! so four came home with meand have now been planted in tubs. They all have a fair bit of growing still to do, but this is themtoday.Last year the slugs and snails feasted on them, i have to be careful what i put down to stop them nibbling because of my cats but a friend recommended egg shells because apparently they don't like or can't crawl over them, so that's what I've done this year and so far so good...bye bye beasties, lol.It's a lovely day again here in the Midlands so Ive planted up some hanging baskets ready for our scorching summer, (yeah right!). It's still not warm enough to leave out all the time so they will be put in the shed every night until probably April is out at least.I'm having one more go this year with tomatoes and if they don't happen this time i will give up, last year i think i was just too wet for them outside and i don't have a green house. I'm having a go with some peas too, it says 'patio peas' so I'm assuming they won't grow too big. This is how the rest of the garden looks at the moment.Everything looks very green but the dandelions in the grass add a bit of colour! now these i can grow without even trying and they don't need any maintenance at all! there will be splashes of colour come the summer from plant too...i promise. I have been stitching this week but I'm not going to post any photos this time as i only have Alla Turca and Grand ABC to show and you must be fed up with seeing those right now ,so I'll be showing my progress another time. I do want to say a BIG 'thank you' to Sandra though, she sent me some NN thread for my AT so at least i can carry on until my LNS has more in stock. Soibhan, thank you for passing on the message you got (you didn't say what her name was) but Sew & So was my first stop for the NN thread, they had been waiting for it for 3 weeks when i phoned but i may give them another call this week, thank you. I've nothing else planned for today except to sit and stitch and watch Twilight, it came last week from the DVD club and i haven't got around to it.

{"title": "New Start & Updates", "date": "Thursday 16 April 2009", "text": "So what's been keeping me quiet? My laptop, that's what! it was my own fault, i installed a new programme not realising that i should have uninstalled the version i didn't want first, and it caused a few problems but luckily it's been righted by the guy who sorts out our laptops for work and everything is fine now. I'll know to ask before i do anything again!We had a very pleasant Easter weekend, my family came round for lunch on Sunday, what started out as being 5 of us ended up being 10 of us! It was nice to have everyone together but i can now understand why the air is blue in restaurant kitchens! We had the full turkey dinner with all the trimmings and everyone presented me with a clean plate :-) and no one has got in touch to say they suffered any adverse affects, lol, Dessert was home made Key Lime Pie, (the first time I've tried this and i was surprised at how easy it was!) it went down particularly well so i will defiantly attempt again, my eldest daughter contributed with a lovely Easter cake made with whole cadbury caramel bars which was really yummy, even the weather was unusually kind to us seeing as it was Bank Holiday. I really should have gone for a nice long walk on Monday to try and burn off a few of those calories but my sofa and stitching was calling me and i couldn't ignore them! This is my progress on Alla Turca, the fabric looks lighter on this photo, it's actually more of cream colour.I've still got part 4 to stitch to be caught up, but think i should manage that this week. I'd been trying so hard not to be wasteful with the NN thread i'm using because my LNS only had 2 skiens, she didn't think there would be a problem getting more and i thought i wouldn't need much more anyway, i should have known my inability to count would have tripped me up, I've had to un-stitch one bit, well, actually rip it out while muttering under my breath how stupid i am would be more accurate. knowing i will need some more thread i go in search the next day only to find that NN is now Threadworx and the name & number have changed, fortunately they are still dying the same as NN so shouldn't be a problem, except the particular one I'm using is not to be found anywhere in the country! i have tried several place in the US too with no luck, one place told me that Threadworxs was having trouble obtaining the thread from Anchor that that is used as the base for this particular colour and it was not expected for another 2-3 weeks. Last week my LNS said that their supplier is due a shipment in 2 weeks and she will let me know as soon as she gets it in. Fingers crossed that i won't have to start all over again with something else, i prefer not to think about that at the moment so we'll say no more for now!~~~~~~~~~~~~I made a new start with the Grand Abecedaire SAL on Gazette94 blog, this is how far along i am this week. I am using Anchor threads 1013 & 1014 with 28 count evenweave (again) i seem to get on better with evenweave than linen, it's kinder on my eyes too, lol.~~~~~~~~~~~~My evenings have been turned upside down a bit at the moment, my husband, Mark (bless him) who usually works anywhere in the country and who i am used to seeing from Friday night to Sunday night is working closer to home for about the next 2 months! (that's 8 weeks, or 60 days!!!), you get the idea, he is here EVERY evening and i have had to resort to wearing my earplugs every night because of his snoring!, if anyone has found a good remedy to stop snoring please, please, please share it with me i would be eternally grateful!Tonight I'm having a night out with some girlfriends so off now to get ready, hope your weekend is great whatever you are up to, thank you for taking the time to visit me and leave a comment, i love to read them :-)...till next time, Tara-a-bit xx~~~~~~~~~~~~"},

I'm not going to show my progress on Yesteryear this time, it really is too pathetic to show!!  i did get settled down with it a few times but  i was struggling, it started off in a hoop then i put it in a frame, then back to a hoop, I'll persevere with it in a hoop now.  It seems i couldn't count either! but I'll put that down to the fact that i was without my reading glasses for most of the week as they were having new lenses fitted, now they are back with me so i wont have that excuse next week :-)    I have the weekend to myself this week as Mark is away working, all my chores around the house and the weeks laundry are done so apart from the usual Sunday morning ironing i can please myself and sit and stitch all day if i want too !, can't be bad :-) So until next time, I hope you all have a great weekend whatever you are up to....Tara-a-bit xx"},
{"title": "Hobby Craft Show & Sunshine", "date": "Monday 16 March 2009", "text": "What a lovely weekend we've had here in the UK, the sun was shining and at last it really feels as though Spring is on the way! There is a rumour that it's to continue for the rest of the week too, how good is that!  My weekend was just as good, i visited the Hobby Craft & Sewing for Pleasure show at the NEC in Birmingham, what a great day! it was just lovely to have the day to myself and browse around the many stalls.  The Hobby Craft show was filled with lovely goodies for scrapbooking & card making, although i love the idea of scrapbooking i am really not that imaginative, nor could i be surrounded by all that equipment, as lovely as it is :-) The Sewing for Pleasure show was filled with the stitchy type goodies i was in search of and i came away with just a few essentials ;)I treated myself to a new magnifier (i just cannot stitch without one of these now!) this one is a little larger than the one i already have and with a longer bendy bit (see I'm so technical, lol).  Two charts, LHN 'The Bookshelf' which i've been looking at for ages, & 'Simply Live' which i thought was simply wonderful after seeing it on someones blog:-) I bought two more storage boxes, you can never have enough of these, right?  There was a really cute cat needle minder that begged to come home with me.... and who can resist a cute kitty :-)  Lastly i bought a sheath for the scissors my daughter bought me last year and I've just started using.I did meet with a couple of non stitchy things, the little wooden box & peg board are to be painted and decorated with decoupage, never tried this but it looked fun to do, and the wool is for a cute knitted bag, these little bags looked great and the instructions say they are a weekend project (I'll let you know if that's true lol), the kit came with pattern, wool, lining material and button, so there you go, that was my day's haul!~~~~~~~~~~Progress on Yesteryear has been almost non existent this week, so no photos to show, i couldn't seem to get back into any sort of routine for anything last week, I've now caught up with the washing ironing & cleaning so this week i shall be able to get back to my normal nights stitching starting right after tea tonight.On that note, DD#3 has just come in from school which is my cue to start tea.   Thanks to all who take the time to leave a comment, i love to read them and they are much appreciated, hope everyone has a good week....Till next time, Tara-a-bit~~~~~~~~~~"},
{"title": "Four Days in Prague", "date": "Tuesday 10 March 2009", "text": "What a wonderful place! if you have never been to Prague let me urge you to book a trip as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed :-) Here's a taster of what we saw starting with our hotel. We could not have chosen a better place, it was a great place and we were very well looked after. It was central to everything being just around thecorner from the Old Town Square.This is the reception area, it's like a conservatory the lift is to left, you could only gain access to your room with a card which operated the lift and the door to the stairs so it was very secure. The hotel has a great history and dates from the 13th century, the story of the building, which at one time used to be an ironmongers is told in the walk way from the entrance to the reception. The front is decorated by the 19th century artist Mikulas Ales and looks fantastic.Our hotel room & the view from the window to the Square    As we rounded the corner from our hotel to Old Town Square on our first night this is what met us The Church of Our Lady before Tyn What a sight all lit up at night, it look magical One of the other great sights in the Old Town Square is the famous Astronomical Clock  Crowds gather to watch the clock strike on the hour. First the skeleton (figure of death) pulls on the rope he holds in his right hand and then raises and inverts the hourglass he holds in his left hand. Two windows at the top then open and the Apostles move slowly around, at the end of this display a cock crows and the clock strikes the hour. The other animated figures are Tuck who shakes his head from side to side, Vanity who looks at himself in a mirror and Greed adapted from a stereotypical Jewish moneylender.The Astronomical Clock was not supposed to tell the exact time but to imitate the orbits of the Sun & Moon about the Earth. Legend has it that when a master clockmaker rebuilt the clock in 1490 the town did not want him to recreate another one anywhere else so they blinded him! poor man, what a thank you!You can go to the top of the clock tower, the views are great, and i did brave it to get some photos, although i am not very good with heights, the last time i climbed a ladder OH had to come up and fetch me back down again   Wenceslas Square - New TownLooking down Wenceslas Square, which as you can see is not a square! The monument is St Wenceslas and the large building is the National Gallery in which we spent a lovely couple of hours browsing around.Charles Bridge As bridges go this is one of the lovely ones :-) it is pedestrianised so is pleasant to walk across, although at the time of our visit there was a restoration programme going on and some of the one side is being worked on, still, it doesn't spoil this view which i took when we climbed to the top of the Observation Tower (another scary climb!). The Observation Tower is on Petrin Park which we reached via the Funicular Railway, which is well worth a visit even if it's just for the view at the top. For those of you still with me at this point, (thanks, you all deserve a medal, lol,) you will have got the general idea that i loved this City, it has such history and the most amazing buildings. We visited many more places, and i would be here forever showing you and i have the dinner to get ready!! so, i have many more photos in my webshots album to share if you want to take a look the link is in the sidebar. I will leave you with one more photo of a really funky building.\"Ginger & Fred\" building, or \"The Dancing Building\" Whichever one you choose to call it it's a cool looking building! We didn't go in there but apparently there is a restaurant in there somewhere! Thanks for taking time out to visit me see you soon, Tara-a-bit x"},

You can't see all the little cute charms from this photos but they are really sweet. It's hanging in the dining room at the moment but may find it's way to one of the bedrooms at a later date, for now i want to admire it :-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I've been working on my Yesteryear this week, not so much as i would have liked though and i did stitch for a whole hour one night then discovered i couldn't count! so threw it on the table and gave up for that night, next night was spent unstitching my mistake and trying again.This is my progress then.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For Mother's day last year my eldest daughter bought me a beautiful pair of scissors and i have forced myself not to use them until i had made a scissor fob for them, this past week i have managed to make one at last, the chart was found in a very old copy of Cross Stitcher.So now i can use them but have to remember to hide them when i am done for the night, as daughter #3 and OH have been know to use my scissors even though i have stressed on more than one occasion that they are for threads ONLY!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~So...no stitching for me next week, we are off to Prague for a week tomorrow morning, just me and OH. It is a sort of birthday present to each other, his is in October & mine is in December and as there wasn't anything in particular either of us wanted / needed we booked this holiday. Daughter #1 is looking after daughter #3 for the week, she is having a weeks holiday with her so she will be able to see her off to school and be here when she gets home.   Our winter woollies are packed, looking at the weather in Prague it's just a bit colder than the UK at the moment so we will need them, the guide book is jam packed with things to see so hopefully i will have lots to share with you next week.  Until then, thanks for visiting me and taking the time to leave a comment, i do appreciate it :-)...Tara-a-bit x"},

DD#3 has gone out with friends so that leaves me myself & I accompanied by a bag of mixed nuts & raisins and a LARGE glass of red :-) excuse me if i start to waffle further on down the post, that'll be the wine! I do have finishes to share (note the plural?) first up is the LK double Flip It's i started this last year, can't remember when. Photos are taken in three sections because it is rather Long.  It is now in the safe care of my LNS for framing, to be collected next Saturday, i will try to get a photos of all of it then.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Next up is my SAL ornament finish for February This is a freebie fromhttp://needlenecessities.blogspot.com/ Heidi's blog. Every month she is making a free primitive design available on her blog, (designed by her)this was the first one.I hope she likes my interpretation of 'primitive'. I do not find it easy to come up with ideas of finishing or sewing nor the fundamentals of a machine come to that, but i am quite pleased with how it turned out, my Home Economics Teacher would have been proud that her lessons had not been entirely wasted on me, however, i am glad that none of you could hear the expletives that were uttered whilst this was in the making :0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~One last item before i go and that's a WIP.I started a LHN called Yesteryear, i am a week into it and this is how it looks so far. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I must end on a sad note, my mother phoned late this afternoon to tell me that her little dog, Dot had been taken to the vets and has had to be put to sleep. Mum took her to have some teeth out at the beginning of the week and she has been poorly ever since, she took her back to the vet on Wednesday because she didn't seem herself, the vet gave her some vitamin shots and various other things but at lunch time today she took a real turn for the worst, luckily my brother was there and took mum to the vets with her where they gave her oxygen and put her on a drip. My brother took mum home but the vet phoned her about an hour later to say that Dotty was not doing very well at all , she was a very poorly girl, her kidneys had stopped working and they could not do anything for her, the best thing would be to put her to sleep, my poor mother was crying when she was telling me, i feel so sorry for her, i know she will not sleep tonight for thinking about Dotty and the fact that she wasn't with her to say goodbye properly, but the poor thing was suffering and they could only do what they did. My mum is going to miss her so much, she has always had a dog, in fact i cannot remember not ever having a dog in the house when we were growing up. Mum was 80 last August so i don't think she will have another dog, she has a cat that was a stray she took in so at least she has something for company, but i don't think she will replace little Dotty.Thanks for visiting me, till next time....

I would have been more shocked to be honest if he had taken a blind bit of notice of any adverts/cards shops/florist/or general window display that has had a Valentine theme for the past MONTH, hellooooooo, have you been going round with your eyes shut?, well yes, actually he probably has! Fast forward to this afternoon, i go to the local Tesco, he goes to the newsagents for a paper, which is a euphemism for ' having a quick pint' (i know this, he knows i know this but you have to play along, lol) upon my return he makes me a cup of tea, helps put the shopping away then announces that he has a present for me, ahhhh me thinks he has redeemed himself, bless.

{"title": "Did You Get Snow This Week?", "date": "Friday 6 February 2009", "text": "No this is not the snow we got in my area, the photos are from the winter of 1947.From 22nd January to 17th March snow fell EVERY DAY somewhere in the UK, the temperature seldom got a degree or two above freezing, there were snow drifts 8 feet deep in some areas. Throughout January 1947 there were 46 days of sunshine & 13 days that were totally sunless, February got even worse with snow drifts reaching 12 feet in places, neither schools, shops or factories closed though. By the end of the month there was chaos, fuel was in short supply and the railways were impassible with striking workers to boot! This was all before motorways, computers & central heating, fuel was in short supply so people just kept one room heated and rationing was still here in the UK too at that time, women were queing for food for an hour at a time in this weather. By the end of the month snow or sleet had fell in the area i live in now for 19 days, hail on 9 days and there was fog on 4 days and the sun had only appeared on 2 days by February 23! the first part of March that year bought much of the same with the second half milder and very wet, the rain causing a rapid thaw and then came the floods.The Big Freeze - 1963I was born in 1961 but my mother has relayed to me often about the harsh weather of 1963, it was the coldest year since 1740. Glasgow had it's first white Christmas since 1938 and from boxing day 1962 until early March 1963 most of England was continuously under the white stuff, although it was sunnier than average, unlike the winter of '47. 1947 was snowier, 1963 was colder. At Herne Bay the sea froze 2 miles out, can you believe that :-o and talking of cold, in 1684 John Evelyn took a coach to Lambeth along the FROZEN River Thames, now that's cold! (click on the link below to see a short film of Herne Bay frozen)http://sasesearch.brighton.ac.uk/view/?from=search&fromid=placeid%3D4&film=1032&imagefile=%2Ffiles%2Ffilms%2F1032%2Fimage_a_full.jpg&imagealt=A+Still+from+%27Herne+Bay+on+Ice%27+%281963%29+showing+the+frozen+seaMet Office - Winter Chills: 1947 & 1963, belowhttp://www.metoffice.gov.uk/education/secondary/students/winter.htmlMore photos from the winter of 1947 belowhttp://www.topfoto.co.uk/gallery/1947Winter/default.htmSomehow this weeks snow seems a little insignificant, don't you think?Keep warm...Tara-a-bit x"},
{"title": "The Big Freeze (Again)", "date": "Monday 2 February 2009", "text": "Well we were promised the white stuff again and it dutifully arrived this morning! everything looks very pretty and it has been snowing on and off most of the day here so, as we live on a hill i parked my car at the bottom of the road when i came home at lunch time and have dug my wellies out of the shed so that i am prepared to either catch the bus to work in the morning (don't think it will come to that) or walk to my car without getting my feet wet!My eldest daughter phoned this morning to say that she was stuck in Nottingham, she had been on a girly weekend to Centre Parks with 4 friends, they went to her car this morning to come back and the battery was completely dead! They were trying to find a security guard to see if they would jump start it for her when she phoned. About an hour ago she called again to say that they found the security guard but they wouldn't jump start the car in case they did any damage!!!! can you believe that?? Health & Safety madness! i suppose they wanted a risk assessment produced first! One of the girls had to phone her dad in the end who was working about 15 miles away and he has gone over to get them going. I just hope they don't come across any delays now because of the weather.I have a finish to show! the first this year! my SAL ornament, and it's very appropriate for today too lol. I chose an Rainbow Gallery Freebie for January, but in hind sight i should have chosen a different coloured fabric, never mind, it's stopping with me so won't really matter!I haven't got round to making it up, i had some fabric squares somewhere that i bought when we went to Cyprus in October, and one of them would have been just right, but they must have been swallowed by the house because i can't find them anywhere!My LK is almost finished , just the boarder to work and i stitched almost half of yesterday, i will show piccies once it's all done.I'm Having A Give Away!According to my blogger profile i have been a member here for two years now, so as i have been having a sort out i thought i would have my first give away :-) I have far too may stitching magazines so these are the first two up for grabs.Issue 140 & 146 of the World of Cross Stitching.

{"title": "Traveling The World", "date": "Monday 26 January 2009", "text": "By way of blogs that is! There really are some lovely blogs in blog land; and it amazes me how many stitching projects people manage to get finished & framed or made into the most lovely things. I have not managed to finish ONE thing yet this year, and i only have 2 on the go!, OK they are almost there but it leaves me wondering how people find the time, I'm exhausted just reading the blog posts, lol. That's another thing, most stitchers seem to have WIP's going on everywhere, how do you keep track! I have thought of doing a rotation and having a few on the go but then i just feel that I'm not achieving anything, I have come to the conclusion that i am a plodder lol, i think i work much better when i have one thing going on at a time, don't get me wrong, i have been a serial starter and must have wasted ££££'s over the years, the charts & materials were put to one side because i had seen another that i must do (sound familiar!) then i would come across them at a much later date and not feel the slightest inclination to carry on with them. Not anymore, I'm cured lol, i have the greatest admiration for you ladies out there that can keep several projects going at once and not loose interest (or the chart) but i think i will carry on with my plodding. So, as you will guess, i have no stitching to show you, (sigh), I have one more word to complete on my LK and a few more stitches to complete my monthly ornament SAL which i was hoping also to get made up before the end of the month, so perhaps next week. On another note, we had a good weekend, OH and i decided to have a day in Bromsgrove (or rather i said i am fed up sitting in on Saturdays, we are going out for the day!) either way we found ourselves there and had a few pleasant hours browsing round the shops and came across a secondhand bookshop and guess what i found? Only the Bill Bryson book i have been looking for, The Lost Continent. It's not a first edition but a re-print of the 1989 London edition (which was when it was first printed) if that makes sense? plus it didn't have the £85 price tag! like i told OH, i saved him £80. Why's that said he? Because i  would have paid that much eventually said I, he he. I do have a book club edition of this particular book but they change with publications, so i shall keep that one too because it does have some nice photos included. I started reading Saturday night.  In this book BB has been living in England for 10 years but has a yearning to return to his roots, he borrows his mothers Chevrolet and sets off on his travels through thirty eight states, keeping mainly to back roads and small towns, the book tells of his encounters along the way with the usual BB wit and observations. I had read a review a while ago that said they thought this book was just an excuse to make fun of America & Americans, i don't see it that way, (he makes fun of the UK and the English to), it's just his humour. Anyway...... OH had a couple of books too so we both came away happy.  On the way back we made a detour and had a late lunch in a little country pub just to complete the day.  It's not often we get to spend time together like that because he works away during the week so it made a really pleasant change.  Hope you all had good weekends too.Tara-a-bit x"},
{"title": "Saturday update on life", "date": "Saturday 17 January 2009", "text": "I seem to have been falling behind with stitching a little this week, on Thursday i had to come home from work mid morning, i was feeling so sick with a pounding head no amount of cocodamol would take away, i went straight off to bed where i stayed till 7pm, didn't feel much better on Friday morning so called in sick and had a lazy day at home. Don't know where i picked the bug up from, but happily today i feel much better. The other thing that has been keeping me occupied is reading, but more about that later. This is my progress on my Lizzie Kate double flip it. I'm enjoying working on this although it does seem to have been a long WIP. I've only got 2 more 'words' to stitch and the boarder and i will be offering the whole series of charts (minus charms of course) as a swap with anyone who has the whole series of any other LK double flip its, so if you would like to do this keep watching for the finish :-)The other thing I'm working on at the moment is my monthly ornament SAL, i decided to stitch a Rainbow Gallery 'freebie'. I had thought initially that i would make this into a small pillow, but the finished piece is going to be too small for that i think, so looks like is will be a door hanging.The reading I've been doing is Bill Bryson's Neither Here Nor There, (travels in Europe) I've been carrying this book around with me everywhere the last week, it's come to work with me to read in between phone calls (which have been a bit thin on the ground soon after the Christmas break). I get some strange looks from the lads when they come through reception and they find me tittering away to myself, they think I've finally lost the plot! . For those who have never read Bill Bryson be warned that you should never read his books in public for fear of laughing out load and being cast as a loony! Neither Here Nor There finds him traveling countries in Europe, it was one of his earlier books and i am finding it fascinating visiting different countries with him, one of them Yugoslavia, which of course is no longer and using their different currencies before the horrible Euro come to be, half the fun of going on holiday before the Euro was the fun of having foreign money, now all we get is the same 'chocolate' coins all across Europe. Anyway, i discovered one of his books one day whilst cleaning out a long forgotten cupboard, the book was called Down Under, his account of travelling around Australia, i was hooked! his wit, observations and description of his travels had me engrossed and wanting more! I think I've learned more about geography by reading BB books than i ever did at school!DH works away during the week and came back one weekend with Made In America, i was thrilled to find when i opened it that it was a 1st edition and signed, how lucky was that! I have since been collecting BB books and have been looking for 1st edition prints. I've managed to find one more 1st edition that is signed , a couple of weeks ago i came across Notes From A Small Island on a book site on the Internet and treated myself to it. I have yet to read this one, but I'm sure its as good as the other reads. I am happy that i have two 1st editions that are signed, my others are 1st editions except for The Lost Continent which i was duped when buying, it is a book club edition which the seller failed to point out, i was very disappointed as this book was his first and is defiantly out of print, i have found a 1st edition of this book but i shall have to save for it as i cannot justify the £85 price tag at the moment!I'll leave you now because I'm starting to sound like Bill Brysons agent, lol. Time to get some stitching done, might manage a couple of hours before tea time.Thanks for stopping by...Tara-a-bit xx"},

I found the little stars hanging from my light in the local Tesco, also came across these little felt decorations, all at a reduced price and they look great hanging from the cupboard doors.We bought some chestnuts on Saturday and they are sitting in Santa's sleigh ready to be roasted on the fire over Christmas.Another bargain picked up at Tesco was this Noel which is sitting on the side boardI actually bought 3 of these, they are so lovely, i have one on the mantle in the sitting room and the other on the fire place in my bedroom. One last bargain buy was this reindeer, star and bell garland on string, it's quite primitive and simple lookingI've done quite well for bargain buys in decorations this year, i have a lovely table cloth for Christmas day from Ikea and some charger plates , but those belong to another post... so for now, tara-a-bit xx"},

It was her 21st on December 2nd..Jo with her 21st balloon.                                                                 All girls together.It will be my eldest daughters birthday on Monday. December is a very busy month for us, my wedding anniversary is on Saturday, (i ask you, what on earth possessed us to get married this close to Christmas, I swear when we married it didn't seem this close, lol, i remember the sun was shining), we don't usually celebrate our wedding anniversary it's a long story but usually one or both of us usually forget and the date has passed before we realise, too many other things going on i suppose. Then it's my birthday on 27th & my brothers on 28th, phew! at least we get a break on the birthday front until April!.Just one more photo to share, i heard that Gillie has received the Christmas ornament and goodies i sent her, i really enjoyed stitching this and i achieved a couple of 'firsts' for me, one being my first stitched Santa and the other being the first time i made cording. I hope you like it GillieIsn't he cute, i almost wanted to keep him for myself lol,  but i know he's gone to a good home :)On that note i will say goodnight, i have to be up at 7am and its 12.30 now, not going to get much beauty sleep tonight!..Tara a bit x"},
{"title": "Winter Warmer", "date": "Thursday 20 November 2008", "text": "For the last 2 years we have talked about getting a log burner in our dining room, the fireplace had already been taken out when we moved into this house but the 'hole' where it had been had been left, complete with the old bricks at the back, the chimney had been plasterboard over and the sides skimmed so that just left a hearth to be built and the chimney opened up, simple eh? my DH works away during the week so everything seems to take longer to get done only having the weekend in which to do DIY, but we have got there and as of last weekend this is what is now in my dining room :) We had logs delivered last weekend too so every day when i've come in from work i have set to work lighting my gorgeous log burner :) and i'm loving it, lol I am now trying to explain to my husband that we NEED to put a sofa in the dining room as there is only me and my DD #3 at home in the week we could sit in the dining room and save on the heating bills, makes perfect sense to me lol. Will keep you posted on how long it takes for him to think it was his idea to have a sofa in the dining room!!! lol.I have been stitching too this week, no photos though because it is for a Christmas ornament exchange, my Lizzie Kate double flip-its have been put to one side until the ornie is done and posted, i am exactly half way through the LK, hope to finish it before Christmas and will post a photo then, so until next time tara-a-bit x"},
{"title": "Back To Winter", "date": "Monday 3 November 2008", "text": "I can't believe we've been back at home a week now, this last week has gone byso slowly! We had a lovely time in Cyprus, as we always do! but this time came back to freezing conditions in the UK, it actually snowed on the Tuesday after we got home!! after just wearing shorts, strappy tops & flippies for nearly 2 Weeks the weather at home came as a big shock i can tell you, lol. We have just about got the house warmed up again & winter woollies have been dug out of storage, i can see that our heating bill are going to be huge this year! I thought i would share a few photos with you of the harbour in Paphos, it's a lot better along the front now as they have reduced the traffic to one way single lane, i still think they could go one better and stop the traffic altogether between say 6pm & 10pm as quite a few restaurants have extended themselves out now there is more pathway, it would just make it a bit more pleasant to eat on the front. Stitching/ExchangingRemember the Autumn Exchange i took part in in October? My partner to send to was Nancy, she let me know that she received her goodies while we were in Cyprus, so this is what i sent her.It was a free chart, (Rainbow Gallery, i think) which i made into a cute little door hanger, my first time making one of these and i was pleased how it turned out, in fact it was starting to look quite at home on my cupboard in the sitting room, i wanted to keep it, lol...Hope you liked it along with the other goodies Nancy :)That's about it for now, my computer is being really slow so i will say tara-a-bit till next time x"},
{"title": "Holiday Stress", "date": "Thursday 9 October 2008", "text": "We are off on our travels again on Wednesday, our Annual trip to Cyprus, staying with the in-laws this time as we managed to cheap(er) flights, i'm looking forward to seeing the sun, goodness knows we have seen very little of it in the UK this year!  But why do i make it so hard on myself?  this week i feel as though everything is backing up behind me and i can't get away from it, lol.  I start to get stressed the week before a holiday, don't ask me why, i know i should be relaxed, no-one else gets stressed (i.e husband, lol) but i do, i have the money to sort (done that), daughter No.3 wants new clothes (she really needs some!) spent 5 hours at the shopping centre last night OMG (done that).  Then there are things that i just HAVE to do before we go, beds have to be changed, windows have to be cleaned, all washing & ironing has to be done, the cooker has to be cleaned (I know) and of course i simply could not go away without taking all the summer plants out of the window baskets and tubs and re-filling with winter pansies & sweeping the yard (front & back).  Does anyone else do strange things before they go away, or am i the only one? please don't let me be the only one lol.  It's just \"my thing\" i'm happy if i can go knowing that my house is clean & tidy, of course when we come home i won't feel happy until i have gone through the house top to bottom again...mad or what lol, i'm never totally relaxed and ready for it until i sit on that plane!Right, got that off my chest, now where is my 'to do list' just thought, i must add clean the car, get hair cut.Till next time...Tara-a-bit x"},

{"title": "Welcome to my New Blog", "date": "Tuesday 30 September 2008", "text": "I had some real trouble with my old blog and decided to delete it as i just couldn't get it back the way i wanted it, basically i tried to make some changes and they went drastically wrong, lol....so here i am again, with a new one :-).I decided to post a little bit about the Blackcountry again just in case anyone new reading would wonder why i call myself Blackcountry Wench, all should become clear when you read on :-)You won't find the Blackcountry marked on any map, but to a traditionalist, the Blackcounty covers West Bromwich, Oldbury, Blackheath, Cradley Heath, Old Hill, Bilston, Dudley, Tipton, Wednesfield a small part of Halesowen, Wednesbury & Walsall but NOT Wolverhampton, Stourbridge, Smethwick or Birmingham. The correct way to pronounce the word Black Country is to link the two words together i.e. \"Blackcountry\", rather than Black Country. Ok here endeth the short history lesson on where i come from, lol. mmmmm, thinking i may make it a feature of my blog, snippets of information from the Blackcountry, what do you think?Blackcounty words I have added Blackcountry words list (right hand bar) with English translations, as i come from the Blackcountry i thought it would be fun, and we do have some funny sayings for things, take a look and see if you can say them, lol. It is a dying dialect now though but i remember when i was little hearing some people speak with a real broad Blackcounty accent....tara a bit x"}
