I figured that was enough reality TV for one day!I found this lady on YouTube and she has a channel that is both hilarious and informative on the topic of menopause.Here is some information a class-action lawsuit for Verizon customers.  Every once in a while I look through the current class action refunds list and sign up for anything I qualify for; it's nice getting an unexpected check in the mailbox every now and then.  There are a lot of class action rebate websites, here is one example.Crime in my city continues to be as insane as usual (this week's example).  No wonder they set the TV show CSI in Las Vegas!"},

{"title": "Merry Christmas Eve!", "date": "Sunday, December 24, 2023", "text": "I hope you are all enjoying your Christmas Eve (or Christmas depending on where in the world you are).Today we are baking for our last party of the year.  The brownies are done...The Brussell's sprouts came on a branch (I've never seen them growing so I didn't know they grew on a branch!)...And I opened a gift from a friend in Japan and have no idea what most of these things are.  There are two scarves, a couple packs of orange candy, but the other packets I have no idea what they are.  Maybe tea?  I need to break out my Japanese dictionary to figure this out (or maybe try one of those apps that translates written Japanese into English).Merry Christmas Eve!"},
{"title": "15 Things From This Week", "date": "Tuesday, December 19, 2023", "text": "In no particular order...I went to get my usual Baskin Robbins Blast drink today and was surprised when the girl who always waits on me gave me a Christmas gift (see photo above).  So nice and so unexpected!Party #1 went well.  We had a nice dinner at a restaurant with my walking group and it was great to see so many walking club members, some I haven't seen in nearly a year!Party #2 was also wonderful.  My nephew and his wife hosted a Christmas party/baby shower for their soon to be baby at a swanky restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip.  The food was great, the service was excellent, and the baby shower games were fun too!Party #3 was nice; our friend hosted a big house party with lots of food (Chilean sea bass is a yummy fish!), lots of friends, and lots of chit chat and camaraderie by all.Two more parties and we will be done for the season!A half dozen of hubby's siblings/spouses will fly in after Christmas to spend the new year with us so I am busy planning food and activities for everyone.At one of the parties, I was talking to a vet about our feral cats.  He said don't feed them, don't pet them, and don't play with them.  I can't not feed them--they always look so hungry.  But his warning about the rare possibility of rabies from unvaccinated feral cats and cat scratch fever kind of eekked me out.  Yikes!Work is still wonderful but getting very quiet as most people who would be emailing or calling me for things head out for the holidays.This guy kind of summed up my opinion of shopping these past several months...Although I have to say I absolutely love shopping at the Goodwill.  On sale day this week I got three nice pairs of jeans for $1 each!On the other hand, I was shopping at Ross today and the cashier asked if I was in the 55+ Club.  Apparently if you are over 55 you get a 10% discount on Tuesdays.  OTOH, apparently, I look over 55 :( :( :( :(Obviously I need to get myself together in the upcoming year (ie: more exercise, better eating habits, better make up? a facelift???  :/ ).There are still so many things I want to do by the end of the year: go through my closet and get rid of all clothes I don't absolutely love, thoroughly clean the kitchen, etc.And while I am terrible at math, I found these advanced calculations quite fascinating.Finally, I found this list of frugal hacks quite useful."},
{"title": "Inching Towards Christmas", "date": "Saturday, December 16, 2023", "text": "I can't believe how fast this year has gone by!  Four deaths, one new career-track job (that I was in no way planning on), a bunch of feral cats, making new friends...it's been an eventful year to say the least.  Christmas is just around the corner then the new year is just around the corner from that.  Wow!  Here are some random things from the past week or so......we have five Christmas parties to attend this week.  Being mostly an introvert, that is 4.5 parties too many....the cats are still around and still watching our every move....but when we step into \"their space\", they flee to the safety of the other side of the fence...and continue watching us....then hubby saw that the house he made them barely fit two cats so one cat was always left out in the cold so he built them a new cat condo this morning....finally, our lemons are almost ripe!"},

{"title": "Have People Lost Their Everloving Minds?", "date": "Wednesday, December 6, 2023", "text": "I don't know if it is just me or the whole world has turned upside down.  People seem to be acting weird in general and I don't understand why.  The final straw on the camel's proverbial back is the currently happening mass shooting incident at our local university.  There is little information about the incident as it is unfolding now but seriously, people seem to have lost all semblance of manners, morals, and values and I don't like it!Yesterday we were at Sam's Club and when I walked down an aisle, a teenage girl started yelling, I guess at me as there was no one else around.  She yelled \"excuse you bitch\" then walked off.  I didn't bump into her, there was plenty of room in the aisle for me to walk by her, and her mom who was nearby didn't even look up from her cell phone.  I didn't call her out since I didn't want to end up on the \"brawling at Walmart\" TicToks but WTF is wrong with people?  A few minutes earlier, same store, I asked a guy who had one of those long carts if he could move it a bit so I could look at the books since his cart was blocking half of the book table.  I asked nicely, and he just glared at me and pulled his cart back.  Then leaving the store, hubby and I were nearly run over by a van.  He had a stop sign, he saw us, and still turned so tightly that he nearly hit us.  Maybe it is just living in a big city, maybe it is living in \"Sin City\" (like what would you expect in a place with the name Sin City?), maybe it is living in an area with literally the dumbest students in the nation (19% of 8th graders are proficient in math and 27% are proficient in reading and the parents are more likely to come to the school and fight the teacher than help their kids learn to read or do math...ugh), maybe it is opening the fire hydrant of bad news every time I open my web browser/turn on the TV...I don't know what it is but I want to move...to Jarbidge!"},
{"title": "My Updated Desk Set Up", "date": "Monday, December 4, 2023", "text": "In the picture you can see my updated desk set up.  I started out with a folding table and I am glad I went that way first because it gave me time to figure out what I really needed in a home office.  We have two guest rooms, and since people usually come visit us in groups, we really didn't want to get rid of a guest room for my office because I tend to work wherever I am (casino, bowling center, etc) so I am not at my desk eight hours a day.In order to keep our guest room intact, but not create a big hassle with taking down my desk set up any time we have guests, I settled on a desk with wheels which makes it super easy to just roll my desk into our bedroom each time people come to visit us.  So now my desk set up includes: the rolling desk (around $100 and comes with hooks on one side to hold my headphones and a file holder on the other side where I can put my notebooks/pens/calendar book/etc).  Also I have improved my monitor (went from a 1080p 22\" monitor to a 4k 28\" monitor; it's incredibly clear!), some Bose speakers (the sound is great!), and my same old laptop, mouse, mousepad, webcam and hub to tie the whole system together.I can easily turn the desk around if I want to watch TV (which is behind me in this picture), or turn it to face the window (much better on a sunny day if I am doing an online meeting and need the light pointing at me and not from behind me) and it has space for everything I do (I did like the extra space of the 60\" desk but this is the longest desk that will wheel out the bedroom door and around the corner to our bedroom because of where the stairs are located).  Overall this set up is working great!"},
{"title": "I'm Trying to Be Joyful But...", "date": "Thursday, November 30, 2023", "text": "...it has been a day...On a happy note, it is our 33rd anniversary today!  I looked at my last post and saw that I put it was our 34th anniversary but it is definitely our 33rd.  I guess the years just blend together now.  Oddly enough, hubby makes me a card each year and on his card he put that it was our 32nd anniversary.A couple of cats came back yesterday.  I was happy to see them again this morning until I opened the back door and saw that a large bird had been shredded all over the back porch.  The cats seemed oblivious to the carnage, they just wanted to be fed.  I was horrified and tasked hubby with getting rid of the bird pieces.  These two cats are always afraid of the birds that eat their food so I am not sure who/what did this.  eeekkkThen I turned on the news and saw that two state patrol officers had been killed in a hit and run this morning while trying to help a stranded motorist.  How truly awful and sad.  I can't imagine the pain their families and fellow officers are feeling now. :(Next--simultaneously--I was trying to guide hubby through the traffic mess of the freeway closure for the crash investigation because he had a poker tournament to get to in that same area so I was texting him on one phone, texting a couple of our Exec Board members on my other phone because they had to march themselves down to our organization's bank since the bank was less than helpful over the phone in order to take care of a few pressing issues, and I had a Zoom meeting going on with a speaker I had set up who ended up giving the wrong presentation (he is new so I didn't say anything, let him talk, and tried to bring the discussion back to the original issue...it probably sounded like I had lost my mind but the guy was literally hired a couple weeks ago so I didn't want him to crash and burn on his first major presentation).  ayayayEverything got sorted--hubby got to his tournament, the bank issues got fixed, and the meeting came to a graceful end so I went out to the garage and somehow slammed my fingers in the door.  How that happened I have no idea.  The fingers were puffy for a few hours but seem better now.Hubby said he would pick me up and take me out to dinner after the tournament and I said no, just bring me food (we had already went to a nice restaurant last night for our anniversary).  If I leave the house the sky might fall or something so I am currently listening to classical music and trying to calm tf down.p.s. YouTube is loaded with calming classical music."},
{"title": "15 Random Things", "date": "Monday, November 27, 2023", "text": "In no particular order...I got the infographic above from Lorraine's FB post.  This is an excellent list of end-of-life documents that everyone should have!Speaking of Lorraine, I was sad to see that she might discontinue blogging.  I have read her blog for more than a decade!  I tend to blog a lot for a while than a little but so far I have no plans to stop altogether.  As far as her reasons for quitting like nefarious stuff, that is pretty much a done deal for all of us (you can put your blog in this website and see that it is immortalized online FOREVER...eeekkk).In fact, nearly everything you do these days is tracked, collated, and analyzed.  Everything!  Double eeekkk.The cats have disappeared!  We haven't seen hide nor hair of any of them for nearly a week.  I miss them and hope someone took them in and gave them a warm place to stay over the winter.Speaking of winter, it was 35 degrees this morning!  It's getting cold in Vegas now.Thanksgiving went well.  We made several dishes and hubby's cousin joined us for a nice lunch (as long as we weren't \"celebrating\" a holiday she was good with it).  Some people just don't like holidays!I successfully avoided buying anything from the massive Black Friday/Small Business Saturday/Cyber Monday sales.  Yay me!  There really isn't anything we need even though \"bigger and better\" things are being advertised all over the place.Speaking of blogging and/or not blogging, I have thought about starting a YouTube channel.  The only problem, more like problems, are that #1 I express myself way better in writing than talking, #2 I am utterly terrible at editing video, and #3 I am not sure what I would talk about in my videos as the most successful channels focus on one thing (tech, money, investing, etc).  If I decide to start a channel, I will definitely let you know.Work is wonderful as always (or almost always).  I love my job!I need a nap.  My niece needed a ride to the airport this morning...at 4am.  While I am a morning person, I'm not a fan of being up that early in the morning.This is our anniversary week!  I met hubby 37 years ago last weekend (the weekend before Thanksgiving I delivered a pizza to him back when I was in college), our first date was 37 years ago today (he called me the weekend after Thanksgiving and asked me out so our first date was the Monday after Thanksgiving), and 34 years ago we got married on November 30th!Using the Edge browser is working well for Blogger.  It seems Blogger isn't a fan of the Brave or Firefox browsers but it works perfectly well on the Windows Edge browser.If you are thinking of moving, these towns will actually pay you to move there.Things I am NOT looking forward to: the upcoming presidential election season, the upcoming tax season (I am pretty sure I will owe this year), and the holiday gift giving season (it now costs a small fortune to send gifts overseas but NOT sending gifts really isn't an option without insulting people).Things I am looking forward to: the kids are planning a surprise for hubby's 75th birthday in a couple months.  While I am usually in charge of everything, I was pleasantly surprised that his daughters wanted to take the lead on this.  Now I just have to figure out what to do with 30+ kids/kid's spouses/grandkids that are going to converge on Vegas in a couple months.  eeekkk"},
{"title": "Preparing for Thanksgiving", "date": "Tuesday, November 21, 2023", "text": "We will have our usual, simple Thanksgiving meal at home on Thursday.  I have all of the \"fixins\" ready to prepare, I will bake pies and desserts tomorrow, and this morning, I went to our local deli and got a pound of thick-sliced roasted turkey (our usual shortcut which is much simpler and efficient over cooking a big turkey when there are only the two of us).  We might have hubby's cousin join us for our Thanksgiving meal which will be nice (she doesn't like holidays but I told her we were making a simple lunch at home on Thursday and she was welcome to come over and eat with us and she surprisingly said she would come over).  In other news...I still have no idea why the feral cats will sit for hours outside the kitchen door and just stare at me while I work in the kitchen.  They are well fed so I don't know what else they want!Apparently Target is offering a complete Thanksgiving meal for four for only $25 (which I think is a bargain as whole turkeys seemed to be $35 and up in the grocery stores this year).The 'Black Friday' deals have been relentless over the past couple weeks (fortunately we don't need anything so I am ignoring ALL of them!).One day I was scrolling Roku's 'Live TV' section and landed on the TV show 'Love After Lock Up' and was immediately transfixed by it (and subsequently binged an entire season).  It was like watching a slow motion trainwreck where you don't want to watch but can't help yourself.  I'm not sure what the attraction is but hubby was as eagerly watching as I was.  Spoiler, you can look up the people from season one who died after filming.  Sad.It seems like most of the YouTube channels I subscribe to have gone from informational and entertaining to long-running advertisements.  Nearly every video is either loaded with ads or has so many \"sponsorship\" call-outs during the video that the videos are hard to watch now.  So now I throw on the headphones and instead of watching the channels I subscribe to, I just listen to long classical music videos while I work or do other things.  It's very relaxing.I wish you all a very happy Thanksgiving!"},
{"title": "Sales and Other Things", "date": "Friday, November 17, 2023", "text": "A bunch of random things...We went grocery shopping today and got everything in the above picture for $49.01, saving $67.57 off the regular price.  We got: 2 pineapples, a loaf of French bread, 8 pieces of fried chicken, a pound of cheese, two racks of ribs, 4 cinnamon rolls, 2 dozen eggs, 4 boxes of brownie mix, 5 lbs potatoes, 3 rolls of biscuits, 2 containers of Coffee Mate, and some heavy cream.  We shopped only sale items/discounted app items and I think this was a good deal overall.50 reasons Australia isn't on the top of my travel list.I made this breadstick recipe last week and hubby said they turned out better than Olive Garden breadsticks.And after much searching, I found this great (free!) file converter that works perfectly.  For several months I took pictures in .heic format which used to be free to convert to .jpeg but then Microsoft started charging for the app to convert the pictures so I looked everywhere to be able to change my pictures to a format that I could actually view (making something free then later charging for it is--IMHO--a jerk move by these companies!).We are all set for our usual quiet Thanksgiving at home next week.The price of stamps is going up in January so I bought a few books which should keep me in stamps for the next year or so.I hope you have a wonderful weekend!"},
{"title": "Veterans Day", "date": "Saturday, November 11, 2023", "text": "It is Veteran's Day and while we didn't do anything really holiday-ish (there is a huge Veteran's Day parade in downtown Las Vegas but there is no way I want to be around thousands of people!), we did get a bunch of freebies from generous businesses since hubby is a veteran.  Hubby got a free haircut from Sports Clips, a coupon for a free haircut from Great Clips, a free pizza and soda from Little Caesars, a free chopped pork sandwich from Famous Daves, and a coupon for a free meal from Texas Roadhouse which we will use at a later date.  We were looking forward to the free buffet for veterans at the Southpoint Casino but when we got there the line was practically wrapped around the casino and it would have been a minimum two hour wait so we just went to their Mexican restaurant and paid for our own meal there.To all of the veterans out there, thank you for your service!"},
{"title": "10 More Things", "date": "Tuesday, November 7, 2023", "text": "Here are a few more things from this week...Blogger has been giving me no end of issues with my blog.  I couldn't comment on people's blogs or comment on the comments they left on my blog and I couldn't upload pictures for the longest time.  I finally found a work around for this.  Now I only sign into my blog on the Microsoft Edge web browser (instead of Brave which I think Microsoft and Google don't like) and that seems to work fine.The little cat in the picture is one we haven't seen in weeks.  There are still three cats coming around to eat and three cats we haven't seen in ages.  I think they have some sort of internal clock since they don't seem at all happy that I am late feeding them in the morning now that we \"fell back\" an hour this week.Along with changing our clocks back an hour this past weekend, we also changed the back-up batteries in our smoke detectors, changed our furnace filters, got the air checked in our car tires, changed the oil and air filters in the car, checked the fire extinguishers to make sure they were still charged, and charged up all of the battery packs.  It's just a good reminder to do all of these little semi-annual tasks when we change the clocks each fall and spring.We picked up some calendars for next year at the 99 Cent store.  I still like to use a big paper calendar to put birthdays and appointments on so hubby can easily see what's happening (he isn't one for electronic calendars).  I was super happy when we got the calendars home and found they were quality calendars with thick paper as so many times when you buy a cheap calendar, you get thin, cheap paper that doesn't work so well for writing on.  This was a pleasant surprise!I've already started Christmas shopping.  I only buy a few gifts to send to friends in Japan as gift giving is very important there.  My local friend is helping out a family this holiday season since the parents have been unemployed for a while so I will buy gifts for their kids.  Other than that, all of the kids and grandkids get cash for Christmas!I need to learn to invest.  I am stacking cash from my job and have put money into mutual funds, a few stocks, and a Roth but I am pretty much flying blind here so I have been trying to learn more about investing by watching YouTube videos which cause more confusion than anything because some people say \"do this\" then others say \"never do that\" while other doom and gloomers are waiting for a stock market implosion...so now I am even more confused than when I started!Even though today is Election Day, we have no local or state elections going on now.  I am really NOT looking forward to the start of the presidential election season which promises to be a nightmare of epic proportions!For some reason, now that I have the money, I don't want to spend it on anything.  I buy small things but as far as going into debt to buy a new house or a new car, it is a big NO WAY for me.  I think I was traumatized by being in debt for so many years that now the idea of payments on anything gives me anxiety.We have been watching the 'Golden Batchelor' on TV and I told hubby he better live to a 100 because the whole idea of dating, for me, is a big NO.  I can't even fathom dating at my age although we have lots of senior friends who are active on dating apps and have super busy social lives.  eeekkkWhile the internet is generally a hot mess of anxiety-inducing news and social media is worse, I have to say that hubby and I \"attended\" two funerals this weekend via Facebook.  In both cases--one funeral on the east coast and one in the Philippines--it was almost like we were participating because people at these events live-streamed them for all of the family to watch, complete with live chat and everything so maybe social media does have some redeeming qualities."},
{"title": "10 Things from This Week", "date": "Monday, November 6, 2023", "text": "In no particular order...We only had a few trick or treaters this year.  I'm not sure why but many people on message boards for our area made similar comments.We moved our clocks back an hour on Sunday.  I love waking up around 6:30am and it is already sunny now.  I hate dragging myself out of bed when it is still dark!On Saturday we plan to hit up some of these Veteran's Day specials, including the free buffet at Southpoint (one of our favorite things to do on military holidays, even if it does take an hour to be seated).This is the first year that I noticed that all advertising prior to October 31 was for Halloween then on November 1st, Christmas was suddenly everywhere--in advertisements, in stores, on the radio...what happened to Thanksgiving?  It seems like with so much emphasis on Christmas shopping starting now, people will be burned out on shopping by the beginning of December!I always admire the wonderful, clever things that crafty people like this girl can do.  I wish I had even a modicum of artistic talent!This was a nice little article on cash-only spending.  While I mostly use a credit card for my spending these days (and, of course, pay it in full every month), I do try to use cash for small things so I carry cash with me at all times just in case.I am surprised to see that CD (certificate of deposit) rates are up around 5% now.  I haven't seen rates on CDs that high in years!We have had way too many deaths this year.  Usually we lose a close friend or family member once every few years, this year we have lost four people so far, two on the same day last week!  One was not unexpected (an uncle who had just turned 100 a few months ago) but another, a close cousin, died suddenly from an aneurysm.  If we can hold off on people dying for a few years, that would be great.My dentist is gone :(  My dentist was awesome and amazing but he recently sold his practice to a corporate dental group because he was pretty overwhelmed with being a solo practice.  He said he would still work for this group for a few years until he retired but when I called to make a cleaning appointment, they said he no longer worked there.  Bummer.  It is hard to find good dentists these days.It's 85 degrees in Las Vegas today.  I LOVE the desert in the winter!And a cute cat photo..."},

{"title": "10 Things from This Week", "date": "Thursday, September 28, 2023", "text": "In no particular order...People are playing nice at work this week so that is good.  On a sad note, two people I really enjoy working with (and have known for years) are moving on to other jobs by the end of this week.  I just hate it when amazing people I have developed great working relationships move on.  In fact, my emails to them have sounded like \"noooooo don't leave meeeee\".  Although I am happy they are moving up to bigger and better things.I've been so busy that I haven't really been keeping up with many (any?) blogs lately but it looks like there is some disturbance in the blogging universe (see example here).  My response to negative or mean comments on my blog (fortunately few and far between) is to delete them and not respond.  I learned that from Oprah when she was trying to be 'fair and impartial' on her TV show by letting a racist spew his hatred on her show.  I think by the next episode she announced that she had built her platform and if people wanted to be hateful they could build their own platform but no way could they use hers to be evil.  Good call on her part.I'm actually trying to avoid most media these days since the moment I check the news/social media/reddit/etc. it's like turning on the firehose of despair.  Non-stop awful news that makes me feel worse  instead of better by partaking in it (examples from my local news include: police are looking for a head that the murderer chopped off and threw away, these evil kids killed someone on purpose and videotaped it then posted it on social media, and this guy got mad at his boss when he got fired so he came back shooting).  Big eeekkkOn a weird note, the appeal I filed for my pandemic unemployment three years ago will finally get a hearing next month.  They said I was paid too much and I needed to pay some of the money back so I filed an appeal.  I called and asked why there is a hearing if I got a letter a few months ago that said my overpayment had been paid in full (no idea who/how it was paid as I sure didn't do it).  The lady said she had no idea but just to do the hearing anyway.  Our unemployment office is utterly inept.This service called Remote Area Medical looks like a great way for people to access some sort of medical care if they can't afford regular doctor visits.And Costco is now offering online medical visits for $29.  Wow!The feral cats are fat and fluffy.  And still won't let me pet them.  They certainly eat a lot!I'm waiting for my new tablet to arrive today.  I was looking for an 8\" tablet I could carry with me everywhere with good specs.  The cost for a marginally good Samsung tablet is over $600 so I found this no-name brand tablet on Amazon for $159 and decided to order it.  I will be shocked if it is as good as people say it is at such a cheap price.On the TV front, I think the blind singing girl from Indonesia should have won America's Got Talent last night (she was truly amazing!) and if they put me on an island with a bunch of touchy feely Gen Zers a la Survivor I would probably mutiny!  On the other hand, we like watching Amazing Race but hubby and I both agree the challenges would be way too physical for us and we would be voted out immediately (faster than immediately if I had to eat a plate of bugs like they did last night). Finally, the weather is cooling off a bit here so I am looking forward to being able to turn off the AC for the season soon.I hope you all will have a wonderful end-of-September weekend!"},

{"title": "It's Too Early for Christmas!", "date": "Monday, September 4, 2023", "text": "Just a quick update but first I must say that it is way too early for Christmas stuff to be out!!!! We were at Big Lots yesterday and I couldn't believe they were already hauling out Christmas stuff to sell.  That's crazy!Also at Big Lots, mixed in with the Christmas stuff, was the Halloween stuff with an earie version of 'Ring Around the Rosy' playing on repeat.  So it's barely September, I'm looking at fake Christmas trees, and listening to children sing about people dying from the plague. eeekkkWe have six feral cats stopping by for breakfast now.  That is getting a bit out of hand.  We did name them though--Grouchy Cat (he doesn't purr or meow, he only hisses and slaps at the other cats), Scaredy Cat (he--she? we don't know which cats are hes and which cats are shes--this one is afraid of everything and tiptoes around, eating as far away from the other cats as possible), Turbo Cat (this one doesn't really walk, he zips, zigzags, bounces, and zooms. He is a very fast cat), Scruffy Cat (this would be a beautiful long haired cat but since I would lose an arm trying to bathe or brush him, he consistently looks scruffy), Whitey Cat (he is mostly white and the friendliest of all the cats but still won't get near enough so I can pet him), and Turbo Sr (this is a very big version of Whitey Cat--they look almost identical--but he is very fast and jumpy like Turbo Cat).  I have never wanted to be a cat lady...eeekkkBusiness is moving right along.  I am officially hired for the job I have been doing for the past five months and now I am just waiting for the board to vote on my salary and benefits (low six figures and more days off between holidays/annual leave/sick leave than I will ever use).  Working from home is AMAZING.  If they would have had this back when I was running my business (like literally running from meeting to meeting all across the state almost everyday), I wouldn't have been so keen on retiring early!The weather around here has been crazy.  A couple weeks ago we got repeated warnings about Tropical Storm Hilary which was supposed to dump a whole bunch of rain on Las Vegas but barely made an appearance here.  Then last week we got no warning about a massive amount of rainfall which caused flooding all over the place and power outages (hubby was bowling at the time so we sat in the dim emergency lit bowling center for an hour until the power came back on).  I'm just glad we didn't go to Burning Man this past weekend!The money I've made from work these past months has just been sitting in my bank account since we already have all of our bills taken care of (when I get enough saved I will pay off the rest of the mortgage in the next several months), we carry no debt, and we don't need anything, but I did make my first splurge this past week.  We bought a giant (!) 85\" TV for $1100.  It looked smaller in the store so we were both kind of surprised when it was dropped off on our doorstep.  With the neighbor's help we were able to get it unboxed and set up and now, even without cable TV, we have way too many options for things to watch.  Our OTA antenna works with it, Roku provides so many stations as does the Samsung hub channels that are built into the TV, and our DVD player from the Goodwill also works great with it.  Also, this TV is so thin and light compared to our 10+ year old TVs that hubby and I can barely lift.  I hope you are all having an enjoyable Labor Day weekend!"},

{"title": "My Final Desk Set Up", "date": "Sunday, July 9, 2023", "text": "Finally I think I have my desk set up just the way I like it.  My entire desk set up includes...A 6' long folding table.  Yes, I do need all of the space, I don't know how I would function with a \"normal\"-sized desk.A 14\" Lenovo Yoga 9i i7 laptop.  It is the perfect size for taking with me when I leave the house and along with a monitor, it makes for the perfect computer when working at home.A 22\" Samsung 1080p monitor.  I love the bigger screen when I have a lot of work to do.  I was thinking about a 4k monitor but they mostly come in larger screen sizes (27\"-34\"+) and also, when the monitor is not far away from my face, a big 4k UHD monitor gives me a headache.A cheap sound bar from Amazon.  The brand is Votntut which I've never heard of but it was under $20 and sounds better than the speakers on my laptop.  If I find that I use my speakers a lot (mostly I am writing, not editing videos and audio), I may invest in better speakers. A rechargeable light that perches on my monitor and helps me look better in videos.  Again, it was a no-name brand from Amazon but it has adjustable lights and hopefully it lasts as long as my meetings do (it doesn't plug in, only recharges when you are done using it...we will see how well this works).A 1080p webcam from Amazon.  The brand is emeet (again, never heard of this brand) but it was under $30 and seems to work fine.A tiny desk lap from Dollar Tree.  Occasionally I need extra light to read documents or something and I didn't want a big desk lamp so this tiny lamp is bright, very adjustable, and it only cost $1!An AM/FM/SW radio that I found at Ross for $20.  Occasionally I like to listen to the radio when I am working so when I saw this, I grabbed it.  It was cheap, a nice size, and sounds great!The headphones are JBL 660NC headphones that I have had for a while.  I think they sound amazing and they cost about $60 on sale and I think they are way better than my $150 Sony headphones.The headphone holder is a clear picture frame from the Dollar Tree.  Why pay $20 for an \"official\" headphone hanger when this does the job?A basic Logitech wired keyboard that cost $13.  It is wired which I like because there is less latency, and since I am not taking the keyboard anywhere, it is fine that it is connected by USB to the hub.A basic Logitech mouse.  I bought a new, cuter Logitech mouse but this old one seems to have a bit more weight to it which makes it feel better in my hand.A cheap mouse pad.  Giant mouse pads seem to be very popular now but this normal-sized mouse pad gets the job done just fine. Finally a hub (which you can't see in the picture) that came from Amazon (again it was a cheap, no name brand) ties the whole system together; it is what everything--computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, webcam--are all connected to.  And of course a power strip to plug everything in to."},
{"title": "So Many Deals!", "date": "Thursday, July 6, 2023", "text": "It's been fairly quiet around here--figuratively speaking, as in I am just working and working--literally speaking it has sounded like a war zone beginning a week ago and culminating with the neighbors setting off commercial-grade fireworks into the wee hours of July 5th.  Now all seems to be quiet, thank goodness.  In other news...The photo is of the full Buck Moon as it started to rise above our city last week.  It was so BIG!We haven't seen the cats in several days; again, I'm not sure if someone caught them and took them to a rescue place or the several days of booming fireworks scared them off.We didn't do anything for the 4th, just stayed home, checked out the fireworks by simply going outside and looking up, and prayed that an errant firework wouldn't burn down our house (it did happen to a couple houses in our city...eeekkk).On to the deals...July 11 is National Free Slurpee DayJuly 11 and 12 is Amazon Prime Day (days?) so there should be lots of bargains to be had.Lining up with Amazon Prime Day will be several other retailers having special sales to compete with Amazon.Get your stamps now, prices are set to increase for postage stamps on July 9.Our schools start early in Las Vegas (around mid August) so all of the stores are already having 'back to school' sales which makes it a great time to stock up on cheap school supplies.If you or someone you know is a veteran, you should know about the new benefits available to veterans through the PACT Act.Every so often I look through unclaimed money sites and occasionally, I even find money due to me.  Here's where to check and see if you are due any unclaimed funds.Also, it's a good idea to occasionally check the Class Action rebate websites.Hubby needed a new computer (I never really look at it so I didn't realize it was so old and cruddy) so I gave him my newish computer and went and bought myself a new laptop.  Even though the laptop was on sale (a $350 savings!) I still save the receipt and check the Best Buy website daily to see if the price will decrease any more over the next two weeks because if it does, all I have to do is take my receipt to Best Buy and get a price adjustment to the lower price.I think that is all for now.  I hope you and yours had a fun and safe 4th of July!"},

{"title": "Happening This Week", "date": "Saturday, June 24, 2023", "text": "Pretty much the same old stuff...work and more work.  In other news...I still haven't heard if I will get this job permanently or not.  I think the Board is waiting for finish up the fiscal year/contracts to decide.  Meanwhile they are very hands off and I rarely hear from anyone (I guess if I was messing up I would hear from someone!).I haven't seen any of the cats for two days.  For more than a week they were a permanent fixture and then after feeding them the evening before last, they never came back.  I know there are organizations in my city that trap and vaccinate/sterilize feral cats so I am hoping that's what happened to them.For the first time ever I have more money than I know what to do with.  I'm sure this is a very good problem to have, but there is simply nothing we need.  Years ago when I was doing this job and making bank, I was spending the money faster than I was earning it and we were always in debt.  Living below your means, not having debt, and not buying extraneous stuff means more money in the savings account!My city still has not hit 100 degrees yet which is really weird.  We have been close, in the high 90s, but so far, no 100 degree days yet.  Meanwhile, Texas is getting hammered with hot weather.We have no plans for the 4th of July holiday.  We will just stay home as usual and on the evening of the 4th we will watch the neighbors set off fireworks which are actually more extravagant than the professional fireworks on The Strip (like professional-grade fireworks that you see on TV from cities around the world).  I have no idea where they buy these but they sound like we are under attack and light up a huge portion of the sky!I hope you are all having a wonderful weekend!"},

{"title": "5 Ways Not to Die", "date": "Wednesday, June 7, 2023", "text": "This week has been fairly eye opening when it comes to health/injury/death prevention stuff.  My work varies from deep conversations with our accountant to interesting conversations with coroners and everyone in between.  So far this week I've learned...Don't fall, especially if you are old.  Also this week, I learned that I fall into the \"old\" category as many injury prevention programs that target falls in the elderly are designed for those over 50(!).  Here is a good resource for falls prevention but it basically boils down to staying healthy and physically fit, managing chronic disease, and removing trip and fall hazards in your home.  Don't do street drugs.  Period.  When I was a teen, drugs were pretty prevalent but back then, when you bought marijuana, you got marijuana and when you bought speed, you got speed.  Apparently these days, even something as simple as marijuana is can be laced with fentanyl to \"increase the high\".  Unfortunately this often has the side effect of causing death.  The coroner I talked to today said many overdose deaths (which are increasing at a rapid pace) are due to combinations of drugs that people may not even know they are ingesting because \"everything but the kitchen sink is being cobbled together and sold as specific drugs\" even if that specific drug is only a tiny part of the combination used to make the drug in order to produce a higher high.  Yikes.Have a bug out bag prepped and ready to go at a moment's notice.  I heard numerous sirens last night so I texted my neighbor and she told me that SWAT had a street a couple blocks away locked down.  Apparently the barricade and stand-off lasted for hours and several nearby neighbors were evacuated because if anyone started shooting, these innocent people could have been toast.  At least if you have a bug out bag, your emergency evacuation will go much smoother and you will have everything you need to spend hours (even a night or more) away from home in marginal comfort.It's fire season and that means several things including dangerous air quality, wildfire evacuations (yet another reason to have a bug out bag as well as a good route out of town), and preparing your home for wildfire season.Finally, watch out for crazy people which is easier said than done.  The news lately is just awful and filled with so many (unexpected) ways to die from road rage to nasty neighbors to being an innocent bystander when someone starts shooting."},
{"title": "10 Things from This Week", "date": "Monday, June 5, 2023", "text": "It's been a busy last few (actually several) weeks!Our apricot tree is growing apricots like crazy.  They are all turning orange now and I am eating a handful for breakfast every morning (it's kind of a race to see who will get more--me or the birds but it is the middle of the desert so I don't begrudge the birds eating as many as they want since they have such limited food sources here).I got a call from our walking club president who said to meet the group at a local restaurant on Saturday because I am getting an award--but he won't tell me what for so I guess I will have to show up and see!The battery in our car was dead yesterday so this morning I took the car to Sam's Club (thank goodness for those tiny battery jumper boxes which come in really useful in these situations!).  I pulled out the receipt from when they changed out the battery a few years ago and saw that is was still under warranty so it took all of 15 minutes for them to install a new battery--and it was free of charge!  I was thinking we would get a small, pro-rated amount off a new battery but it was totally free so that was nice, especially in an area where the average lifespan of a car battery is only a couple of years.Work is going great.  I think.  I am truly terrible at the political machinations of a high ranking executive position.  I just do my work and hope everyone else is doing theirs but I have stirred up a hornet's nest a couple of times by pointing out things that are being done/have been done that weren't done how they should have been done.  Apparently there are reasons for this that escape me and the emails start flying.  Ayayay Hubby's sister and her husband will be here for a couple of weeks.  It's World Series of Poker month here in Vegas and they, along with hubby, will be playing in several poker tournaments.  I miss working at the WSOP but since they moved it to a Las Vegas Strip casino instead of an off-Strip casino, there is no way I wanted to drive to and from the Strip everyday.  My friend who works there said it takes her an extra hour or more just in traffic everyday getting to and from the Strip!I've been watching Whitney Webb videos on YouTube.  Yikes, that's some scary stuff!  EeekkkThen there are the Facebook files.  Double eeekkk The weather here is getting hot!  It's been hovering around 100 degrees every day so I go out and get my walking done at 6am.Our city is gearing up for so many things in the coming days/weeks/months--our ice hockey team is in the Stanley Cup, it looks like the Oakland As will be moving here, The Strip and surrounding roads are being set up for the Formula One races which will take place in November, and our city will host the Super Bowl next February.  Wow!I hope you all are having a wonderful beginning of summer!"},

I went from several years of quiet retirement to a full-time, running-like-my-hair-is-on-fire job in a matter of hours.  I'm still loving the job though.My 92 year old friend who was super sharp and alert at the beginning of the year, went into a sudden cognitive decline that was remarkable in its speed and just very sad for all who know her.  Fortunately her daughter realized what was happening (probably because of the sheer number of calls about her mother from myself and several other friends who were concerned about her) so she came into town, sold the house, packed up all of her mother's stuff, and moved her across the country in record time.My wonderful neighbors who have the best kids and are the best Indian food cooks ever, suddenly packed up and moved in less than a week.  The husband does contract work all over the world and while they aren't moving far, just relocating to LA, I am really going to miss chatting with the family, baking treats for their kids, and eating the wife's amazing food!Trying to get hubby care from the VA and military medical system is way more difficult since they made \"system improvements\" in order to offer \"better care\".  Complete BS of course since calling into the pharmacy took three hours last week, pushing his case through the system to get him new hearing aids took several calls to the patient advocate and months of waiting for appointments, and getting a referral doctor to even answer their phones almost never happens.  So much for \"improvements\".And don't even get me started on the seismic shift in people's attitudes, driving ability, and ability to handle stress over the past couple years..."},
{"title": "My Very Inexpensive Home Office Set Up", "date": "Monday, May 8, 2023", "text": "Since I am working from home, I figured I should set up a home office of some sort.  For the most part, the only items I need for work are a laptop and a cell phone but it's great to have a quiet spot set up when it comes to online meetings or making phone calls.  So I commandeered one of the guest rooms...After much perusing of home office set ups on YouTube (in which people spend a small fortune creating amazing work spaces), I figured I needed a workable space but I didn't want to spend much on it as I don't know how long I will be working--it could be a couple months or it could be several years!So I used what I had and went cheap on stuff I had to buy and it came out like this...The components include:A 6' folding table which we had.  We paid about $30 for it years ago and I was surprised to see that they now sell for $70+!A table cloth we had stored in the garage.A $12 folding chair from Ross.  I rarely sit for long, maybe an hour at a time.  If I was sitting for hours on end I would definitely get a good office chair.  As it is, I work at home, in the casino, in the bowling center, in the rodeo arena...basically everywhere I can get a wifi signal.A 14\" Lenovo laptop I use when I am not at home or use as a second screen when needed.  I've had this laptop for a few years.A 16\" Lenovo laptop which I bought a couple months ago because I wanted a new, faster laptop with more storage.  Some old headphones I had.  These are JBL 660NC headphones which I got for about $60 on sale and I like them much better than my expensive Sony headphones.A $5 ring light from Ross.  Apparently you need light pointing at you, rather than coming from behind you, to look good on video  I'm learning the online meeting thing as I go...A basket from Dollar Tree to lift my laptop up during meetings (I also learned you want to look straight or up to the video camera and not down on the video camera or the video will be pointing up your nose!).A steno book from the Dollar Tree because I take a lot of notes.A weekly blank calendar.  I use it more often than my online calendar because, again, I take a lot of notes.My expensive cell phone which I've had for several months.  I rarely use it for work but if I need access to videos, fast internet browsing, or opening complicated documents, I use this phone.A work phone.  The boss said 'buy any phone and phone service you want'.  So I bought a cheap Pixel 6a phone and got a $15 Mint Mobile monthly plan and I was in business.  Since I do most work by email on my computer, and am in a location that gets a good Mint signal, it didn't make sense to spend extravagantly on a phone or phone service.  This cheap phone also works great for making calls.Other things I use: iDrive for cloud file storage, Zoom for meetings although it looks like most agencies are now using Microsoft Teams.So far everything is going great!"},

{"title": "10 Things I Learned This Week", "date": "Saturday, April 22, 2023", "text": "It's been a super busy week!  This week I learned...That I love working.  I pop out of bed at 6am, watch the sunrise as I drink my tea, trundle to my office down the hallway, and get lots of work done before the emails and calls start.That when I am so busy on my computer all day, I have no desire to be online afterwards so no doom scrolling, no online shopping, no reddit/weblist/Bored Panda/etc.  It's really nice and relaxing not to be online.That when I did have some down time, after a week of not being online, I couldn't believe how awful nearly everything online was--depressing, sad, \"news\" that is really opinions, people being mean and angry about every little thing...I think in the future I will really limit my time online.That the lady in the accounting department is a genius.  She is super helpful, super organized, and brilliant with numbers (my eyes started to glaze over when she started discussing the intricacies of taxes based on each line item but I digress...).  My job is so much easier when someone knows the answers to all of my questions!That unraveling someone's life after they pass away in this digital age is difficult.  When my grandfather passed away many years ago (pre internet), my grandmother called the lawyer and the accountant and everything was taken care of.  Now that my friend's daughter is handling her mother's estate, there are hundreds of things to take care of (dozens of online accounts, changing the 2fa for several of her accounts to her daughter's phone, setting up an \"estate account\" at the bank, hiring estate sale people to deal with all of the stuff in her mom's house...every day it seems she has a new challenge to deal with).On the flip side, work in the digital age is so much easier!  I've had a half dozen meetings in the past week that years ago would have required several hours of driving, a fancy copy machine, and a briefcase full of contracts/note taking supplies/other documents to get my work done.  These days I just hop on Microsoft teams, watch (or listen if I don't need to present anything) the meeting, and documents are shared/signed/submitted in minutes via email.  It's definitely a better way to work!That the whole online meeting thing requires some planning and skill.  I need a quiet location, a good background, good makeup (those 1080p webcams show every little wrinkle!), good lighting (I don't want to be too washed out, too bright, too red-toned...eeekkk), and practice (I can now share my screen in record time instead of heming and hawing while looking for the right place to click on my screen).That I am too old for some of the \"woke\" crap in meetings.  Like introducing yourself with your \"pronouns\".  These are science-based meetings...my pronoun is pro science.  ggrrrrrrThat I don't shop nearly as much when I am busy working as I did pre-job.  I haven't seen a Sam's Club or Costco in a few weeks, I don't shop for entertainment, and I don't shop online nearly as much.  Now shopping seems like a waste of time when I could be catching up on work.Finally, I learned that I can be way more productive than I have been in retirement.  Before working, I thought about writing a book, starting a small business, or some other challenge, but thought I didn't really have enough time since our days are always pretty busy with activities. I have, however, been able to churn out quite a bit of work while basically doing the same amount of activities (now I work away on my computer at the bowling center when hubby bowls, do my work at the casino when hubby plays poker, get a few hours of work done in the early morning before heading out for a walk, etc."},

{"title": "A Quick Update", "date": "Saturday, April 8, 2023", "text": "I felt like baking today so I baked some bread ^^^   In other news...My friend was taken off life support earlier this week and passed away soon after.  I can still barely wrap my head around the fact that she is no longer here.  This a was a 'no big deal' type of surgery and she had so many plans for after the got out of the hospital but now her daughter is left to sort through her estate (which is kind of big and kind of complicated) and grieve at the same time.  I was, however, happy to hear from her daughter that one of the little boys she kind of adopted as a surrogate grandchild and took care of for the past several years had a dream after the passed away and said she told him she was fine, everything would be OK, and to tell her daughter that she loved her very much.  I love signs like that after someone passes away!Our other friend who is 92 years old now has her house up for sale and it looks like she will be moving across the country to live with her daughter.  I was surprised to see her house up for sale since I saw her the day before the sign went up so I called her and asked if she was moving and she said \"my daughter says I am\".  We will miss her when she moves.We have no plans for Easter so will probably spend the day watching the Masters golf tournament.My allergies are killing me.  This happens every year but the problem usually starts in February not April but I guess since we had a longer, colder, and wetter spring than usual, it pushed allergy season out several weeks.Allergies not withstanding, the weather now is perfect!  It's a balmy 78 degrees and perfect Vegas spring weather!I hope you all have a wonderful Easter!"},
{"title": "100 Things About Ageing (Part 4 of 4)", "date": "Friday, April 7, 2023", "text": "And finally...76.  Put all of your important documents in one place in your home (like a fireproof safe) and let your most responsible friend or relative now where this is.  Note, don't put your will or original copies of other important documents in a safe deposit box.77.  Get a bidet!  For people with mobility issues (and everyone else!), a bidet can be a great way to tidy up after using the toilet.78.  There are a lot of other tools specifically for the elderly or those with mobility issues too (like grabbers, long handled shoe horns, back scratchers, step stools to reach high cabinets, etc).79.  There are also ways to design and organize a kitchen for people who want to age in place (these updates focus on safety and ease-of-use appliances in the kitchen).80.  If you are caring for an elderly person from afar (or want your kids to be able to find you if needed), consider installing a remote-access camera system in your home as well as use an Apple/Google watch/phone with the \"find my android\" or \"find my iphone\" app installed (make sure you/they can access these apps remotely from your/their phone or computer).81.  If the worst happens, here is a useful checklist for what to do when someone dies.82.  Seek solace from others who have gone through what you are going through (such as this, this, this or in-person support groups).83.  Exercise your brain regularly to stave off cognitive decline by doing puzzles, word games, card games, etc.  A lot of our friends meet up at least weekly to play mahjong, rumikube, or poker which is great for their brains as well as for socialization.84.  Keep a positive attitude--this is said to improve ageing.85.  Keep up with regular medical care (skin cancer screenings, vaccines, blood work, etc).86.  Keep up with regular dental care (regular dental cleanings and x rays to keep your teeth in good condition, denture realignment if needed, etc).87.  Have a long-term care plan.  This may or may not be necessary but when you need it, this sort of care can be ridiculously expensive.  It pays to plan ahead for such a possibility.88.  Join clubs that are only open to seniors (examples here, here, and here).89.  Get rid of bad habits (smoking, alcoholism, etc).  Obviously easier said than done, but the longer you have these bad habits, the worse it is for your health.90.  Take a walk after each meal instead of beaching yourself on the sofa.  My grandmother did this all the time and said it is good for digestion (she also did headstands and cartwheels into her late 70s!).91.  Make friends of all ages.  There is a lot of learn from friends your age as well as from the old old, but making younger friends is also beneficial.92.  Work on sleeping well every night.  Again, easier said than done for many people, but getting good sleep is important for your energy levels during the day as well as your general health.93.  Take care when using supplements and other \"anti ageing\" products advertised on TV.  Many of these things are a straight rip off, on the flip side, overuse of these products could be toxic.  Check with your doctor about these things for an expert opinion.94.  Take fire safety seriously.  Seniors are at a distinct disadvantage if there is a fire in their home so it pays to plan ahead.95.  Be open to new experiences and following your passions.  This makes life more interesting, makes you an interesting person to others, and fills your retirement days with fun things to do (examples here, here, and here).96.  Create a bucket list and strive to check off every goal.97.  Age gracefully...or radically.  Examples here, here, here, and here.98.  Check out the myriad of senior resources online (examples here, here, and here).99.  Age joyfully.100.  Leave a legacy."},
{"title": "100 Things About Ageing (Part 3 of 4)", "date": "Wednesday, April 5, 2023", "text": "Moving right along...51.  Lonely?  Consider getting a pet (preferably from a rescue).  Pets are great companions, give you oodles of unconditional love, and are even good for your health (examples here and here)!52.  Pick up hobbies that you can carry into old age.  Obviously I wouldn't recommend parkour, but things like fishing, knitting, genealogy, etc. are hobbies that people can do at any age.53.  Look into the many travel opportunities available to seniors.  Seniors can get a lifetime National Parks Pass for only $80, there are a number of senior-only travel groups, and even senior-oriented cruises.54.  Speaking of travel, did you know that many seniors travel for medical care?  From medical tourism, to hopping across the border for cheap dental and vision care in Mexico, to even moving abroad for cheap yet high-quality elder care.55.  For a more local type of care when you are ageing, there are several options for having friends or relatives get paid to care for you (examples here).56.  There are also several options for getting free or reduced prescriptions if you need them (examples here, here and here).57.  And if you are a veteran, don't forget to take advantage of the numerous veteran's benefits at both the federal and state level.58.  If you live in a college town, besides taking advantage of community life programs that are open to the public like lectures and performances, did you know that seniors can often attend university classes for free or cheap? 59.  Another way to keep busy is to volunteer.  One friend of mine is a retired dietician so she spends one or two days a week volunteering at a local food bank, sorting food and teaching participants how to create healthy meals out of the food they receive from the food bank.60.  More senior housing options if you don't own a home: low income senior housing (varies by state), living with others like the Golden Girls, having a rent controlled apartment, living in an ADU in your kid's back yard, renting out an ADU in your backyard, vandwelling, or even living on a cruise ship!61.  Use a big calendar.  I used to keep my calendar digitally on my computer but these days, since I don't work, I may not check my email/calendar for several days so now we have a big calendar in our kitchen with appointments, birthdays, events, etc which we see everyday.62.  Keep a \"sick kit\" in case you come down with the flu and can't get out to a store for supplies.63.  Ask for what you want.  If someone asks what you want for your birthday, for example, instead of saying \"anything\", ask for something you will specifically use (like grocery or restaurant gift cards).  This way you won't end up with shelves full of dusty tchotchkes.64.  Instead of struggling with a problem, ask for help.  Sometimes you need help navigating tech, navigating government programs, or just navigating your daily mail.  Ask someone to help you with difficult things; most people will be more than willing to help if they know specifically what you need.65.  Sometimes you need people to advocate for you if you have a difficult problem.  This is why hospitals have patient advocates, states and sometimes local news stations have consumer advocates, and there are even victim's advocate programs, etc.  Utilize their services if necessary.66.  If you are stuck with a problem that you don't know how to deal with, call 211.  This is a hotline for help with pressing social service and other needs.67.  Note that if you need help with mental health issues, 988 is the new number to call for this.68.  If you need to find honest, reliable doctors/dentists/service providers, I usually skip Yelp and online review sites and ask friends for personal recommendations, search our local subreddit by topic like 'electrician' or 'plumber', or ask other service providers (like the local car parts store for mechanic recommendations).69.  Share your knowledge with others.  Seniors are taking to the internet in droves to share their knowledge whether through blogging (hi bloggy friends!), via YouTube, on TikTok, or through regular mentoring programs (examples here and here).70.  Don't be afraid to turn over work to the younger generation.  Before, hubby used to cook for all family gatherings but these days that is too physically taxing on him so now we assign parts of the job to the kids and grandkids when they visit.  Ditto home improvement projects (we recently asked the son in law who is a contractor to come visit...so he can install a walk-in shower for us!).71.  On another topic, I haven't dated in 40 years so I don't know much about this subject, but judging by the number of seniors we know who are dating, this is a big deal.  Whether they meet people in person or online (eeekkk...the horror stories I have heard!), this is a topic of concern for seniors.72.  On a related note, if you decide to get married at a later age, there are several things to consider.  From protecting assets for your descendants, to the possibility of losing insurance/pension payments from a deceased spouse, there are many things that make this more complicated.73.  Another senior money topic is when to take social security.  This is definitely something that should be researched ahead of time.74.  As a side note, if you take social security before full retirement age, there are some rules about your earnings you should know.75.  And no matter your age, you may find discussing everything from earnings to investing to remarrying to making a retirement plan with a qualified financial planner.On to part 4..."},
{"title": "100 Things About Ageing (Part 2 of 4)", "date": "Tuesday, April 4, 2023", "text": "Continuing on...26.  Be debt free ASAP.  Whether you are retiring or just want to be more financially secure, get out of debt as fast as possible and stay out.  You can make a limited income stretch further if you aren't paying multiple debts (with interest!) every month.27.  Consider bulk cooking.  A lot of times, people who are elderly and/or living alone don't feel like cooking a complete meal every single day.  With soups/stews/chili/etc stored in single-serve containers in the freezer, you will always have a good meal at hand when you don't feel like cooking.28.  For seniors who have difficulty cooking for themselves, local Meals on Wheels programs may be a great option. 29.  Other food options to look into: meals at the local senior center, accessing food stamps, and community meal programs for seniors.30.  Do all you can to avoid falls.  Did you know that falls are the leading cause of hospitalizations and one of the leading causes of death for the elderly?31.  Consider your driving and know when to hang up the keys.  Obviously this is easier said than done as may seniors don't live in places with good public transportation or they may see this as limiting their freedom but it is an important topic look into as you age.  Here is a way to evaluate your driving ability.32.  Look into taking a senior driving class in your community (there are several, this is one example).  After taking the class, people can often get discounts on their car insurance plus it is just good information to know.33.  If you know of a senior driver who could be a danger to themselves or others, most states have a senior driver reevaluation process as well as rules specifically for elderly drivers.34.  Check out the senior centers in your area.  We have several in our city which offer meals, exercise classes, or just the opportunity to socialize. 35.  Depending on your ethnicity, there may be special centers in your city such as Tribal Elder Centers, Chinese Senior Centers,  Jewish Senior Centers, etc.36.  A great way to socialize and get some exercise is walking.  I belong to a local chapter of this walking club and our area also has a senior hiking club.37.  For people who really want a lot of activity and socialization opportunities, consider living in a senior (55+) community.  Here is the club list for a senior community in our area.  A caveat for this, grandkids and younger family and friends are limited to the number of days they can stay with you.38.  Speaking of exercise, there are so many opportunities for seniors--from following along with a chair yoga YouTube channel, to swimming at your local pool (seniors get discount passes for this), to participating in the Senior Olympics!39.  Ask for senior discounts everywhere you go.  We do this and often save 10% off our groceries, 10% off at Ross on Tuesdays, and 10% off our groceries at a local Asian store on Wednesdays.  Here is a huge list of senior discounts to check out. 40.  You can also sign up for this huge list of birthday freebies to help you celebrate growing older!41.  Here's a list of mental health resources for seniors.42.  And here's a list of elder abuse resources (I think this is a bigger problem than most people realize).43.  And here's a quick reminder about seniors and sexually transmitted diseases.44.  Create a life file.  My friend just passed away yesterday and now her daughter is tasked with so many things that probably weren't taken care of because my friend's death was totally unexpected.  This life file list is a good place to start when it comes to planning your end-of-life no matter your age.45.  Take a video of your home and it's contents.  This is great information to have if you suffer a disaster or need to file an insurance claim.46.  Speaking of disasters, prepare a \"Go Bag\" in case you need to evacuate your home during a disaster or find yourself staying over night at the hospital.  Here's how to do this.47.  On your cell phone, keep an ICE (in case of emergency) number for your next of kin/trusted friend on the lock screen.  This way, if you are unconscious, the police will know who to contact on your behalf.48.  Also on your phone, keep your (and the spouse's) list of medical information (prescriptions, health history, allergies, doctor's name, health insurance info, etc).  This is much easier to provide during a medical emergency than trying to remember all of this stuff off the top of your head.49.  Consider taking a senior self defense class.  It should never come to elderly people having to physically defending themselves but that isn't the society we are living in now.50.  Stay up to date with cell phones and new technology.  While there are several things that aren't great about technology, cell phones, tablets, and computers can become lifelines for seniors so it is good to learn all you can about them. On to part 3..."},
{"title": "100 Things About Aging (Part 1 of 4)", "date": "Monday, April 3, 2023", "text": "Unfortunately I have had way too much experience with aging issues over the past several months.  Here are many of the things I've learned...Downsize to a reasonably-sized house and yard while you are still young enough to do this on your own without being forced to do so when you are elderly and/or ill.Try to get a place without stairs (stairs are the bane of most elderly or infirm people).If you are a life-long renter...well good luck with that.  As we have seen over the past couple years, there is no limit on how high rental prices can go which is a disaster if you are on a fixed income.Try to have your house paid off before you retire.  Again, the fewer bills you have, the further you can stretch a fixed income.See if your county or state offers a senior property tax abatement program.  Our county has such a program which allows us to save several hundred dollars on both our vehicle registration fees and the property tax on our house.Consider making home improvements that will make aging in place easier.  Here are several ways to do this.If you cannot afford to make such home improvements, see if there are programs available to help you.Live closer to town where you can access public transit, para-transit, ride shares, etc.  Living far out in the country becomes exponentially more difficult as we age and have issues with driving ourselves.Have as big of an emergency fund as possible.  The longer we live in our homes, the more things break down and need (often expensive) repairs.  Obviously big, expensive repairs are more difficult to cover on a smaller fixed income.  Also, DIY repairs become more difficult as you age.If you are younger and have a ways to go towards retirement, don't count on retiring on only social security.  It is best to have a pension (or two!  several people I know have both a military pension and a pension from a government or civilian job).  Savings, investments, 401ks, etc are all additional sources of income for retirees.Become familiar with Medicare before you need to rely on it.  From my point of view, it is a convoluted mess so plan accordingly.  Figure out if your Medicare plan or your savings will cover things like glasses, hearing aids, dentures, prescriptions, etc.  These are all expensive, necessary things which basic Medicare usually doesn't cover.If you can barely eek out a retirement in the US, consider retiring abroad.  This guy has a YouTube channel with many posts about retiring in the Philippines.Google your area and senior services (this is an example from my area--I didn't realize they had so many services just for seniors!).Buy items with longevity in mind.  We bought a car that we hope will last the rest of our lives, and I am going to buy a washing machine that will hopefully do the same.  The older we get, the less we want to buy things, fix things, and replace things.Also reduce the amount of stuff you buy.  We don't need a lot of consumer stuff as we age, we don't need to spend our limited income on buying material goods, we don't need to store/clean/upkeep/insure consumer goods, and we don't want to leave a mountain of junk for our kids to sort through after we are gone.Stay healthy.  Eat as healthily as possible and be sure to exercise every single day.  Exercising daily improves your health (prevents doctor visits and chronic health issues) and falls (improves strength and balance).Review critical health needs on an annual basis.  Do your hearing aids still meet your needs or has your hearing declined necessitating new ones?  Can you still see well with your current glasses or should you get a new prescription?  Has your physician reviewed your medication list to make sure there are no conflicts or drugs you no longer need?  How are your dentures looking (these need to be replaced at least once a decade or sooner)?No matter your age, make sure you have your end of life documents updated regularly, signed, and notarized.  You literally NEVER know when you will need these.Regularly Google senior scams to see the newest ways scammers target seniors.  There are literally so many scams out there I could write an entire book about them.  I am very careful about who I give any of my personal information to, we don't answer our phones unless when know who is calling, and we don't answer our door unless we know the person (even with a 'no soliciting' sign, our neighborhood is overrun with solicitors...who apparently can't read).Make your home as secure as possible.  Long gone are the days when we could leave our doors unlocked (I don't thinking my grandparents even had house keys...neighbors would stop by and leave a pie on the counter, workers would borrow a truck which always had the keys in the visor, etc).  If you do that these days, you wold probably come home to squatters or an empty house!Review your insurance coverages to make sure they still meet your needs.  I call around for insurance prices annually because the cost for bundled home and car insurance can change so much each year.Practice living on your retirement income before your retire.  Figure out what your fixed income will be then put the rest of your income in savings.  Track your expenses in order to see where the holes in your budget are and figure out how to mitigate these before hitting full retirement.Consider how you will stay active once retired.  We have friends who can afford an elaborate retirement (international travel, golfing, a second home) and other friends who can barely afford to eat, let alone spend money on activities.  We live frugally and enjoy a wide range of activities mostly because there are so many free or cheap things to do in our city to keep us busy.Some ways to stay busy and save money: volunteer, work a temporary or part time job, inexpensive weekly group activities like walking or bowling, senior half-price matinee movies, starting a YouTube channel, etc.Build friendships.  From what I have seen, most of our senior friends rely much more on their friends than their family when it comes to getting them to doctor's appointments, checking on them daily, helping with home issues, picking up groceries when needed, etc.On to part 2..."},
{"title": "10 Things I Did Today", "date": "Wednesday, March 29, 2023", "text": "In no particular order... I took a picture of the sunrise (see photo above).I came across this article and it made me look at things in a new way.I weighed myself.  eeekkk  I NEED to start eating better and exercising more!I backed up all of my files (I try to do this at least once a month).I came across this great deal which I need to look into (I currently have Mint Mobile which is $15 a month but now that TMobile bought out that company I am not sure how that will effect their low-priced plans; this may be a good back-up plan).I saved $650 by not buying a tablet today (Galaxy Tab S 8+ that was $300 off!).  It had a great price so I put it in my Amazon basket, but then I figured that I already have a good tablet and that this tablet, while it has amazing specs, was 12.5\" which is really too big to be a portable tablet, so I quickly deleted it from my basket.  Even though something is on a really good sale, it doesn't mean I need to buy it!I used Craigslist for the first time in ages.  We replaced our barbecue grill with a three burner outdoor stove so in order to get rid of the BBQ grill, I listed it in the free section on Craigslist.  Hopefully someone picks it up soon as it still works really well, it just needs to be cleaned up a bit.I'm waiting for my Amazon delivery of this blanket today.  I bought this blanket for one of the guest rooms and it is so absolutely purple that I had to buy one for a friend of mine who adores the color (her entire house is various shades of purple--she even has a purple refrigerator!).I got a message from the daughter of my friend who is in the hospital which said her mom is taking tiny steps in the right direction.  She is still on a ventilator but any positive news is good news!I picked the last of our lemons.  There were only a few left on the tree as this is the end of lemon season but it looks like our apricot tree has hundreds of blooms.  I think I may plant a grapefruit tree too!"},

My physical upkeep has taken a back seat since we have been so busy the past few months.  I need to walk more and eat junk food less!But then I think I really have a lot to be thankful for and my life is pretty great so I should stop catastrophizing over every little thing (tell that to my menopausal brain)..."},

{"title": "20 Things to Check Every Year", "date": "Saturday, February 25, 2023", "text": "Note that the picture has nothing at all to do with this post, I just took it this morning on my walk!  Anyway, here are 20 things to check every year that can save you big money!Car insurance.  I usually call around once a year as my car insurance is coming up for renewal just to see if I can find a better deal.  Right now we have our car insurance through Costco and it is a pretty good deal but it always pays to check.House insurance.  Same as above.  We generally bundle our house and car insurance to get an even better deal.  Note, some insurance companies charge a higher price for car insurance and a lower price for house insurance or vice versa so you might have to break out the calculator to figure out the best deal.  Rates will also vary by the size of your deductible, your credit score, where you live, if you have any hazards (like a pool for your home insurance, or drive for Uber when calculating car insurance).Health insurance.  Often times your health insurance is set by your employer but if you are using the public market, check your state health insurance (ACA/Obamacare) because it seems like income qualification rates change every year and even if you didn't qualify last year, you may qualify this year.Cell phone plan.  I used to check cell phone plan rates every year when whatever discount I was getting expired but for the past few years I have been using Mint Mobile and I haven't heard of any other cell plan that is only $15 a month!Food stamps.  Like state health insurance plans, the income needed to qualify for food stamps (SNAP) seems to change yearly too so if you have a change of income or life circumstances, you may find you qualify for food stamps.  It doesn't hurt to check!Free or reduced school lunch.  Similarly, income qualifiers for free or reduced school lunch for your kids can change so it pays to check every year just to see if you qualify.  You may even find that your state is now providing free lunch for all students (my state just started doing this and I think it is an excellent use of our tax money!).WIC.  The Women, Infant, and Children food program is similar to SNAP but it is geared towards pregnant women and women with small children.  Again, program qualifiers change yearly so even if you checked to see if you qualified for this program in previous years, it pays to check every year that you are pregnant or have small children just to see if you qualify.Tax withholding.  This is something you can (and maybe should) change when your life circumstances change or if you are getting a huge tax return back each year and would like to spread that income throughout the year.Your mortgage.  Have you paid enough on your mortgage that you can drop PMI (private mortgage insurance)?  Often times your lender won't remind you to check this.  Are mortgage rates dropping and you could save lots of money by refinancing?  Is your escrow account balancing out each year or do you need to change this?  Many thing effect your mortgage payment (usually principal, interest, and property tax) so any ways you can reduce these things or speed up the payment of the principal, will save you money.Internet and cable TV.  Providers of these services as well as plans can change often so it pays to check and see if you are getting the best deal.  We dropped cable TV all together and now use an over the air antenna but we still need internet so I check for deals on our rate plan each year just to see if we can get a new, better deal to help us save money.Subscriptions.  Do you need all of the subscriptions you currently have or could you cut a few to save money?  Netflix, a gym membership, Costco/Sam's Club, online services...sometimes we have old memberships that are auto-billed that we don't even use anymore so cancelling them could save you money.Prescription medications.  It's a good idea to review your prescription medications annually with your doctor (there may even be some you no longer need) as well as review prices for your prescriptions in order to save money.  I've heard good things about the GoodRx app, non-members can still use Costco and Sam's Club pharmacies to buy their prescriptions, Walmart is also cheap for certain medications and if you are really in a pinch, there are several prescription assistance programs that may be able to help you cover the cost of your prescription meds.Investments.  It is also a good idea to review your investments with your financial advisor every year.  Are you meeting your employer match?  Are you maxing out your ROTH?  Do you need to rebalance your portfolio?  Doing these things annually can ensure you are getting the full benefit of your investing.Credit report.  I pull our credit reports annually just to make sure there is nothing unusual happening with our credit that we don't know about.  I also have a credit freeze on my accounts with all three credit bureaus for added protection.Utility bills.  I check our utility bills each month, note any increase in usage (a good way to see if you have a water leak) and check the flyers that come with these bills for any freebies they are offering (our electric company is now offering free refrigerator and washer replacements!).  By checking the utility company websites you can find help for paying your utility bills if needed, check out the freebies section (I order free shower heads when needed from the water company), and many utility companies offer other discounts (we get a discount for paying our sewer bill annually instead of monthly, and our electric company offers ways to pay an averaged out bill each month over the course of a year instead of being hit with huge summer bills because everyone here uses lots of air conditioning).Home inventory.  Each year hubby gets his cell phone and videos everything in our house.  This is a simple way to document everything we have for insurance purposes in case disaster strikes.  I keep these videos on my computer, backed up on my phone, and backed up on a thumb drive too.Review tax return.  These days we take the standard deduction but in years past when we had a larger income, a business, and a huge amount of deductions, I would review every line of our tax return in order to plan for the following year.  This way I could see what other deductions we could take on both the schedule A and the schedule C the following year and remember to keep my receipts for all of these things so I didn't have to go hunting for receipts a year after we bought something.Payment discounts.  Whenever possible, we get good discounts by paying our bills annually or biannually instead of monthly.  We pay our sewer bill annually, our cell phone bills annually, our insurance bills biannually, and our HOA bill annually, all of which save us money over paying these bills every month.Financial planning checklist.  Usually towards the end of the year, we review a few financial planning checklists to see if we are missing anything that could save us money.  Here is an example which is a good reminder of things to do over the course of a year with your finances.Finally, I review a list of important documents and make sure we have all of these items in a file in our safe.  I also scan all of these documents so they are backed up on my computer.  Some sample lists here and here."},
{"title": "Never Will I Ever...The Financial Edition", "date": "Saturday, February 18, 2023", "text": "You've heard of \"never have I ever\" but this is a bit different since I have, in fact, done some of these stupid financial things that only served to drag us deeper in debt.  Suffice it to say, we learned from these experiences and now have an unofficial list of ten financial things that we will never do again including...Buy a timeshare.  This is a HUGE waste of money (you can get a nice hotel suite in many vacation destinations for much less than the initial and annual costs associated with a timeshare), also it's virtually impossible to get out of a timeshare deal once you sign on the dotted line.Loan money to anyone.  If we can't afford to give someone in need money as a gift, we don't give them money at all.  This is the quickest way to lose your money and your relationship with the person at the same time.Sign up for a gym membership.  I know some people who use the gym religiously everyday and for those people, a gym membership makes sense.  For many people (myself included at one time), signing up for a gym membership when I had no track record of using a gym and after a few weeks, a recently-developed aversion to going to the gym, the long contract that is virtually impossible to break was a giant waste of money!Leasing anything.  I did so many car leases and wasted so much money, it wasn't funny.  These days we save money to buy what we want with cash and NEVER lease anything (cars, furniture, etc).  We did buy our most recent car, not on a lease but with a super low interest loan, which we paid off very quickly.Use a credit card to buy anything we don't already have the money to pay it off with in savings.  Currently many Americans are drowning in credit card debt and this often starts with small purchases because they don't have cash to pay for an item which then ends up being a massive, high-interest debt because all of those small purchases really add up!  Use a payday loan/title lender.  I would beg for money at an intersection before going to these super high-interest, loan shark-esque places.  300% to 400% for a loan?? No effen way!Buy anything that has ongoing expenses for the life of the item unless absolutely necessary.  Cell phones are a necessity so we pay for them in full initially then have a cheap Mint Mobile plan that we pay for once a year for the phone service.  Other things like boats, RVs, golf club memberships, vacation property, etc. are generally a huge waste of money because there are ALWAYS big initial costs followed forever by daily/weekly/monthly/annual costs for something that you usually only use occasionally. Pay bail for anyone.  I had a relative that I hardly ever talk to text me once and ask for a loan of $10k to bail her kid out of jail.  Needless to say I declined this opportunity because #1 we never loan money, #2 paying for a bail bond means you don't get that money back and she is always broke so there is no way I would have seen my money again, and #3, after reading the charging documents, her kid really did deserve to stay in jail (he is currently serving an eight year sentence!).  Generally people who end up in jail deserve to be there and it makes no sense to leverage your financial future to bail a criminal out of jail.Buy anything to \"keep up with the Joneses\" or show off how \"rich\" I am.  This includes fancy cars, huge houses, a Birkin bag, etc.  Small, minimal, and affordable is how we live.  We have no desire to pay out the ears for expensive, unnecessary things.  While I would love a $70k truck (yes, they are that expensive these days!), it would be unnecessary (we don't haul anything these days and live in a city), it drops in value the minute it is driven off the lot, and it just isn't practical or necessary for us when our basic, inexpensive, paid off SUV works just fine for our needs.Take out student loans.  Student loans are massively over-priced for what you get (basically a piece of paper with minimal relationship to most actual jobs), non dischargeable ever (like even in bankruptcy, if you die, or if the industry you studied so hard for evaporates...eeekk), and they will accrue interest forever leading to many people taking 20+ years to pay them off!"},

{"title": "Some Great Home Purchases", "date": "Saturday, February 11, 2023", "text": "Here are a few things I have bought/repurposed recently for our home...When the flooring guys pulled out our stove to put new flooring underneath it, I was shocked (and grossed out) by how much food and debris had managed to slide in between the stove and the countertop!  After thoroughly scrubbing the sides of the stove and the cabinets, I immediately hopped on Amazon and ordered these silicon counter gap strips which so far have worked wonderfully!  They do their job of keeping any spills from running down the side of the stove and are easy to clean.Of course, I still rave about the bidet I have had for about a year now.  For around $35, it saves its cost in toilet paper several times over each year and we have also had several guests use it and immediately want to order one too!After we got the wood floor put in, I asked the sales guy how to clean it and he said to just use a Swiffer.  Since I don't want to buy a product that I need to keep buying refills for all the time, I bought a $6 mop from Ross......and made my own Swiffer-like device out of it!Finally, we had a lot of pictures on our living room wall that we took down during the renovation.  Instead of putting them back up, I decided I wanted to put them in a digital photo frame.  Then I checked out the prices of digital photo frames (yikes!  I didn't know they were that expensive!) and then I remembered that I had an old tablet-style laptop that we don't use anymore so I set it up to be used like a photo display frame and now it's screen saver just shuffles through hundreds of family pictures!"},

This week seems be giving us a breather before we gear up to host a dozen guests in early March.  So far...Hubby's sister passed away just minutes after she was removed from life support last week.  Several family members were with her and the rest of us were there in spirit--and on FB messenger--as it happened.  Some things I didn't know: cremation in her area is only $1300 (I thought it would cost much more) and obituaries submitted to the local newspaper cost $300 (I thought this was free!).Hubby also had his 74th birthday last week.  It was a low-key day but over the weekend three different friends took us out to dinner to three different mid to high end restaurants to celebrate his birthday.  We have wonderful friends!We did a speedy 'pack stuff up and haul everything out of the living room and kitchen so the flooring guys could come in and install new flooring' thing.  It only took them two days and watching them install the flooring made me happy we didn't try to do this ourselves--it looked quite complicated and involved lots of physical labor.  Now we are putting everything back together in the living room and kitchen and hubby said doing the upstairs flooring will probably take place several months from now--after he recuperates from this physically taxing past week!Here are a couple of great deals from the National Parks Service: Gold Star families and military retirees can now get free lifetime park passes here (plus free annual passes for active duty military members).  Also, you can get free seed packets here from the AltNPS organization.Finally, the comments on my blog, my replies to comments on my blog, and some comments I make on other people's blogs seem to be all messed up!  Not sure what is happening but it might be the browser I am using...I hope to figure this mess out soon!

{"title": "A Few Things About Dying", "date": "Wednesday, February 1, 2023", "text": "Hubby's sister is on life support and they were supposed to take her off life support this morning as there really isn't any hope for recovery.  However another sister just arrived at the hospital this morning from another part of the country and when the doctor came in to have the final discussion, this sister wanted to wait a few more days (she is the spiritual sister who is convinced God will intervene and her sister will be miraculously saved).  Cue another zoom call with the dying sister's kids and all of her siblings debating her fate.  The doctor was really good, laying out the options--everything from taking her off life support today and she would most likely pass immediately, to waiting a few more days, to aggressive treatment that will keep her alive, via machines, for the undetermined future.  He pointed out it should be a group decision instead of putting all of the pressure on her kids to decide.  Then he kind of waited while a lively discussion ensued, in three languages, by the people with her in her hospital room and several people online.  The consensus was to wait one more day then take her off life support tomorrow.So the few things I learned about dying today are: have a will, a living will, and medical power of attorney so your life, or lack thereof, doesn't come down to a debate between family members, and make your wishes clearly known to your family members while you are still of sound mind and body.  The debate today was \"what would she want done in a situation like this?\" and since she didn't have a living will and had never mentioned what her final wishes would be, the suggestions ranged from take her off life support now since there is no hope of recovery so why make her suffer longer, to wait several days to see if her health somehow improves (very unlikely).  No one wants to make a decision like this for their loved one (what if we pull the plug too soon and she could have lived longer? what if we wait too long and she suffers needlessly?) so it's important to make these decisions for yourself so no one feels guilty for the rest of their life because they had to make a choice between life and death for anther person."},
{"title": "And The Hits Keep Coming", "date": "Tuesday, January 31, 2023", "text": "Moving into week two of everything going wrong and stuff just keeps happening! We got the paint (under $100 so that was good) and painted the living room before thinking it looks really really lite compared to the old color.  Hubby likes the old color better so we stopped after painting the living room and will wait until the floor is installed to see if we want to switch colors back and hire a PROFESSIONAL to do the painting.  I suck at painting (it's a good thing the flooring is getting replaced because I got paint everywhere) and I suck at picking colors (I don't have an artistic bone in my body!).  ayayayThe relative who bought an airline ticket last week to come visit us next month (hubby's sister) that I mentioned in my last post, and who we thought her health was too poor to have her traveling anywhere let alone across the country, is now on life support which will probably be discontinued this evening.  It is a sad thing all the way around.  Hubby doesn't travel anymore so we will watch the last rites via FB messenger this evening.  Another sister flew across the country to see her yesterday and promptly got sick upon arrival and tested positive for covid so not only can she not see her sister for the last time, she is now isolated in another family member's house by herself until she gets better.My friend called this morning and her furnace died (she lives in a very cold climate) and now she needs to replace the entire system.Hubby's fish that he has had for about 8 years suddenly died (and this fish seemed like it actually had a personality!). I got a notice on FB that an old friend that I hadn't seen in years just had a heart attack and died (and he is  my age--only mid 50s!).Another friend called and told me her dad had a heart attack last Saturday but the cardiologist didn't come in until Monday to treat him (what kind of major hospital doesn't have 24/7 cardiology coverage???).Randomly, this movie showed up on my YouTube feed a couple days ago.  It features a friend of mine, Helene, who is continuing to fight her own battle with cancer.Finally yesterday, we heard a big bang upstairs, went up to look and didn't find anything wrong, then later that night we saw that a big, heavy piece of artwork that we had on the wall just fell off the wall for no reason!I'm hoping Murphy moves along soon..."},
{"title": "When Everything Happens All At Once", "date": "Tuesday, January 24, 2023", "text": "It's been...a week.  So far...We filed our taxes already and will be getting a nice refund but with the current debt ceiling mess, I'm hoping we get our return promptly (and hubby's military pension...and Social Security...and VA disability payments)  eeekkkWe will use our tax return to pay for all new flooring in our house.  I would have tried to do the flooring myself but I don't know how to take out the old flooring (it's glued down to the slab foundation), get rid of the old flooring, and cut the new flooring accurately.  In this case, I think it is better to let the professionals do it.And since I don't want to take every single item out of each room twice, I decided we will also paint the entire house as the flooring is being done.  Hubby is not happy about this since he is old and crunchy but I like painting and it will save us a lot of money over hiring professionals to do this.  I am old and crunchy too so while I've painted the interiors of several houses, I haven't done this in more than a decade!  Wish me luck!We went to Costco yesterday and they didn't have a single egg to sell!  I don't really eat eggs but all of the baking I do for friends and family requires eggs so I am pretty bummed about this.  We will also be having about a dozen relatives come to visit in March so I would like to be able to make them breakfast everyday which requires...eggs.  :/One of the relatives that is coming to visit is in such poor health I have been asking the other relatives to try talking her out of visiting.  The last time she came to visit we had a trip to the hospital, a $100 fee to overnight her necessary medications here because she forgot to pack them, and she took a tumble down one stair and ended up black and blue from head to toe!  She is currently in the ICU with a long list of serious medical issues but she is still insisting on visiting (even though the medical services in my city are God-awful compared to New England where she lives).  ayayayI am still babying the washing machine along.  I don't really want to spend $1200+ for a new washing machine right now with so many other things happening but then again, laundry for a dozen visitors may require this.  When it rains, it pours!Also this week, the electric in hubby's bathroom went out.  Hubby and a friend changed out the breaker and the GFCI (which somehow fixed a couple of issues we had with the outside outlets) but the light and fan still won't work so we will need to call a real electrician.  I called to get estimates for a real electrician to come over to check out the problem and for someone just to show up it is $150 to $190!Finally, I got a reminder from my dentist a few days ago about my upcoming appointment to get my teeth cleaned this week which was great--my dentist and his entire staff are awesome so I always look forward to going to the dentist.  Then yesterday some guy called and said my appointment was cancelled as my dentist sold his practice to a corporate chain of dentists which has pretty terrible reviews, a bunch of complaints on the BBB website, and some specific notes on local bulletin boards to \"avoid this chain at all costs!!!\".  Needless to say, I need a new dentist.  Of everything that happened this week, this is the things I am most disappointed about :(Oh, and last but not least...within 24 hours, two old Asian guys killed more than a dozen people in California.  My peer group is old Asian guys and this is unheard of in this cohort.  WTF is wrong with people lately?????"},
{"title": "10 Great Deals for Veterans, the Elderly, Etc", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2023", "text": "I was reading Lorraine's blog where she detailed the process of getting a great deal on a new roof (info here and here) and it made me think about other great deals people can qualify for.  Often these deals are based on where you live, your income, your age, your veteran status, etc.  Here are some of my favorite deals:National Park Passes.  These can be free or highly discounted depending on which pass you qualify for.State Park passes.  This is an example for my state.  Many state park systems offer free or discounted passes that people can qualify for.Tax exemption programs.  We enjoy a huge tax exemption on both our cars and house through a county program for disabled veterans.  Many cities and counties around the country offer similar programs.Movie discounts.  Hubby and I enjoy going to the movies at a local theater for only $4 each on senior days.  This is less than half the price of a regular movie ticket!Utility rebates.  Many local utilities (water, gas, electricity) offer discounts and rebates on a range of things.  Our local water company offers landscaping rebates as well as car wash coupons, our local electric company offers a bunch of rebates and freebies, and our natural gas company also offers several rebates and freebies.  I believe all of these companies also offer payment assistance for low income folks if they need help paying their bills.  Also, energy star rebates are available all over the country.  Check the websites of your local utilities and see what you might qualify for!If you are a senior, here is a huge list of senior discounts.  And vets/active duty military can enjoy a similarly long list of discounts and freebies.  Ditto if you are a student.Depending on where you live, there may be grants/discounts/freebies based on local needs.  This is the program Lorraine used for her roof (which makes sense as the area is prone to hurricane-force winds and having a sturdy roof is important).  In California, earthquakes are the problem so they have programs to help retrofit homes to make them safer during an earthquake.  Here is another kind of grant in my state to help low income people make needed repairs to their homes.  Basically Google your local area plus the type of help you need to see what is available.Here are a bunch of states that provide free college to students (I WISH they had such programs when I was a student!).The federal government also offers a huge list of grants to individuals, non profits, government agencies, and NGOs for a wide range of programs and needs.  I used to write these grants and got everything from firefighter turn-out gear and medical supplies to shooting range mitigation products and food for distribution just by filling out a simple application (and sometimes 90-page not so simple applications).Finally, here is a list of freebies and grants that many people can qualify for.  These types of programs can change frequently so it pays to Google whatever kind of discount of help you are looking for just to see what pops up!"},
{"title": "20 Places We Buy Food And Other Things", "date": "Wednesday, January 18, 2023", "text": "With food costs skyrocketing, we are definitely pulling out all the stops to buy our food and save money at the same time.  Here are the places we shop for food (note we live in a big city so your options may vary):Costco.  We have a membership at this store and sometimes buy food in bulk here but most often we shop at...Sam's Club.  We also have a membership at this store and since it is closer to where we live, we most often shop here when buying food in bulk.  Of course, we compare prices here to what we would pay in other stores and only buy items here when it is a good deal.Albertsons.  This is a chain grocery store and we always buy food that is on sale on their app, in their sales flyer, or from the bakery and meat bargain bins.  It's rare we buy anything full price here because their prices--other than sale items--seem kind of high.Smiths.  Another chain grocery store where we also shop app and sales flyer sales.  Again, we rarely buy anything at full price here because other than sales and loss leaders, their regular prices also seem high.  Of note, we often fill our 5 gallon water jugs here because it is a dollar cheaper to fill them here than at Albertsons.Dollar Tree.  Occasionally when walking through their food aisles we will find super cheap items like the random boxes of couscous, gnocchi, or bags of grains or other food items that appear to be overstock and closeout items from other stores.99 Cent Store.  Unfortunately this chain is no longer \"everything for 99 cents\" like it used to be but we can still find good deals on produce and other food items which, again, appear to be closeouts and over-runs from other grocery stores (recently we found mayonnaise here for 99 cents when the same item would be $4.99 at other stores!).Ross.  See photo above...they have a very random assortment of food items here so I always check the food shelves just to see if there are any good deals.  Once I found a giant jar or ground ginger for around $3 which was very cheap compared to other stores.TJ Maxx.  Same idea...lots of random food items, often \"high brow\" stuff, and prices that range from still expensive to awesome deals so whenever I am at this store I make a quick run through their food aisles just to see if I can find any great deals.Asian grocery stores.  There are several Asian grocery store chains in my city and we randomly visit them when we need to stock up on Asian food items.  Again, we only buy things that are on sale or that we can't find anywhere else.Hispanic grocery stores.  We also have several Hispanic grocery store chains in my city and their stores are huge (like Albertsons and other chain grocery stores).  We always buy produce at these stores because the prices are incredibly low (not sure how they accomplish this but most produce they offer is well below the prices for the same items at other stores).  We also like their meat departments (they have actual butchers that break down whole animals in the back and you can find every part of the animal at these stores as well as goat and other game meat that is hard to find elsewhere).  Their bakeries are also pretty good too!International Marketplace.  This is one huge store that offers food items from all parts of the world so I can get cheap prices here on Indian food, Asian food, Hispanic food, European food, etc. as well as buy all kinds of fish and seafood products at reasonable prices.Military commissary.  We live far from the military base but when we do go there, we usually go to the commissary and see what they have.  Years ago, military commissaries offered the same groceries we find in the regular stores for half price or less but something happened and now their prices are comparable to outside stores so there isn't a lot of cost saving there but sometime we can find great sales and then we really stock up (a while back we saw they had cans of condensed milk for 75 cents a can which is unheard of in regular stores as the price is more like $2.50 a can so we bought a dozen cans at once).Walmart.  Walmart seems to have pretty good prices on many food staples so we shop here occasionally.  I'm not a fan of shopping at Walmart (too many shoppers, pretty meh service) but when I have a lot of random food items we need to buy, we will stop by and pick up what we need.  Farmers markets.  Our city has many farmers markets in the spring and fall and occasionally we will visit these places more for entertainment than anything else and buy things if they have good prices.Swap meets.  Kind of the same as farmer's markets, these places are very entertaining and often have booths selling local produce and other food (the Mexican swap meets are the best).  This isn't a regular place we buy food but sometimes we come upon great deals like during the last hours of the markets on a Sunday afternoon where the vendors just want stuff gone so offer huge discounts.U-pick places.  We used to go to these places a lot when we lived in Washington.  In Las Vegas there is only one u-pick farm that I know of and, as entertainment, we sometimes go there just to see what is growing and pick some produce for ourselves just for the fun of it.Discount grocers.  We have a Trader's Joes here which we rarely go to because it is so crowded, we don't have an Aldis which people often rave about for their low prices, and we do have a WinCo which is all the way across town so we rarely shop there but according to others, these are great places to stretch your food dollar.Grocery Outlet.  We don't have one of these stores here but I often shopped at this store in previous cities.  This is a scratch and dent/overruns/etc kind of stores which offers good prices on groceries but the selection can be very hit or miss.Restaurant supply places.  In our previous city, there were a few places to shop for groceries which were restaurant supply places that allowed the public to shop there too.  It was a good place to shop in bulk but you had to compare prices because sometimes things were a good deal and other times the cost was actually more than in regular grocery stores.Online.  I have bought food items on Amazon because the prices were so good and I got free shipping.  I have also looked at other online places but if they didn't offer free shipping, the price would have been more than buying the item locally (I wanted a big bag of buckwheat flour but the shipping alone was more than the bag of flour!).  This is also a good option for buying hard to find items (I just ordered a box of Japanese Kit Kat bars from Amazon which are cheaper than buying the same item in local Asian stores...I can't wait until they arrive!). On a side note, here are some random interesting links...Get a free cat calendar here.Here is info about getting a free electric stove from the government.And a list of other free appliances and things for low-income Americans. Here are some amazing thrift store finds (I always hope I can find such things when I am thrift shopping!).And some more amazing finds.Just a reminder to see if you qualify for any of these class action rebates.And a list of birthday freebies.

{"title": "Happy New Year...And Some Resolutions ", "date": "Sunday, January 1, 2023", "text": "Happy New Year to you all!  2022 was...a year.  Not much good or bad to say about the past year but it is nice we are moving on.  I am cautiously hopeful that 2023 will be an even better year than 2022.  Last night we stayed home as usual--once on the Las Vegas Strip for new year's eve was more than enough for us!--and watched the new year countdown on TV while also watching the fireworks on the Las Vegas Strip from our upstairs windows.  Lots of people in our neighborhood set off professional-grade fireworks which are huge and beautiful but it sounded like a war zone around here until well after midnight.  My resolutions for the coming year are pretty basic and very few, just some things for self improvement and other projects that I really want to accomplish this year.  This should be more manageable, I think, than having a giant list of goals.  My resolutions this year are:Eat whole food, plant-based vegan for the entire year.  This will be difficult but my diet lately has been absolute crap so I started the day today with oatmeal and fruit...so far, so good!Walk every day and finish 100 volksmarches.  My walking club has a challenge to complete 100 10k walks during the year.  I always sign up for this challenge but never complete it so I figure that if I do two walks a week, this will be simple to complete (I always wait until like September when I would have to do a 10k everyday until the end of the year and, needless to say, never do this!).  I want to walk some distance everyday so hubby and I started this goal today by walking 1.5 miles to the grocery store and back where I bought some veggies and took the picture above.Renovate the house.  It has been more than ten years since we bought our house and at the time everything--paint, carpet, appliances, etc--were brand new.  I want to refresh the house with at least paint and new flooring, maybe new appliance and new countertops, and possibly a new AC unit since ours is more than 15 years old.Pay off the house.  We are making good progress on paying off the house but still have several more years left on the mortgage.  This goal is kind of wishful thinking at this point but maybe if I focus on this a la law of attraction thinking, we will miraculously get the house paid off ASAP.Take a photo everyday.  I've tried to do 90 day photo challenges in the past and didn't complete them because other stuff came up.  For now I will see how long I can keep this streak alive and post a daily photo on my other blog as well as Facebook.Do an activity every week.  We generally go out and go shopping or stop by and see friends or go out to eat somewhere every week but this year, at least once a week, I am going to plan an actual activity with hubby.  Our activity for this week will be going to the movies tomorrow (senior day with $4 movies).  When the weather gets warmer we will do more outdoor activities.Blog more consistently.  My blogging here and on my other blog has been kind of hit or miss this year so I want to set a consistent blogging schedule for this year.  Not sure if I will blog daily but at least a couple times a week will be good.Write daily.  I have more than a dozen fiction books in some state of completion.  I love to write and I get inspired and write like a mad woman then get bored and set the book project aside.  Rinse and repeat.  Maybe I will get a whole book finished this year!That's it!  Eight goals that I will (hopefully) successfully complete this year!"},

There are often several food pantries in your nearby area which offer a wide range of food for those in need.Free government cell phone and plan.  This varies by state so just Google your state and free government cell phone (the link is from my state) and see if you qualify.Mint Mobile.  If you don't qualify for a free cell phone plan, Mint Mobile is only $15 a month and is available to everyone.  We have used this plan for a few years and love it!  We just pay for the plan once a year and don't have to worry about billing for an entire year.Free high-speed internet.  This is an offer for low income folks which was put together by the federal government.Over the air TV.  While we don't qualify for free internet, we did cut out cable TV and now have an internet-only plan because we get all of the TV stations we need (about 80 stations) with a simple $15 OTA TV antenna which we bought at Best Buy.Cheap internet service.  Unfortunately our internet service isn't as cheap as we would like it to be since Cox is the only high-speed service provider in our area but we did do many of the things in the linked article like buying our own modem/router and regularly checking the Cox website for cheaper plans in order to get a pretty good deal on our internet plan.Other viewing options.  We really do have too many viewing options even without cable TV.  We have a basic Netflix account (there is an even cheaper Netflix option that was just launched), plus I sometimes watch Pluto TV and Tubi online for some specific shows I like.  Some friends swear by Amazon Fire Stick, Roku, and Chromecast but I haven't tried any of those.  I've also heard of people signing up for an initially discounted Apple TV/Paramount Plus/Disney+ plan then stopping that plan with the initial offer ends and switching to another discounted initial plan offering.The library.  We have an amazing library system that I absolutely love.  I've downloaded thousands of free ebooks to my Kindle app, they also offer free online magazines and newspapers as well and movies and music.  The library system itself is amazing--they always have free classes and events which are open to the community, they also offer free access to their DJ/podcasting booth and teach people how to make their own music, podcasts, and videos!Government tax exemptions.  You can google your local city/county/state along with 'tax exemption/abatement programs' and see what they offer.  In our case (example in link) we save more than a thousand dollars a year on our vehicle registration fees and property tax!  We also made sure we set our property tax cap correctly as well as filed for a homestead exemption.National Parks Passes.  We live by several national parks so hubby got a lifetime senior pass (back when we got it, the cost was $20--and it's good for a lifetime!).  We also got a discounted state park pass since hubby is a senior.  One of the best deals I've heard about for a state parks pass is in New Mexico where you can camp for an entire year at their state parks for only $225!Free camping.  Speaking of highly discounted camping, the linked website shows you where all of the free camping spots are around the country.  You can also camp for free in state forests and on DNR land.  Other camping options include super cheap camping at LTVAs and, probably as a last resort, Slab City.Birthday Freebies.  While you probably don't want to overindulge by signing up for all of these programs, it's nice to see your inbox fill up with offers for free yummy gifts on your birthday.Help paying bills.  If you need help paying your bills--everything from utilities to housing and more--the linked aptly named website will point you to programs that help people with this.  Note you can also google your area and 'utility bill help' or 'medial bill assistance' and will probably get lots of links for nearby assistance programs.Low-cost and free prescriptions.  Prescription medications are ridiculously expensive these days!  Fortunately there are some programs that can help people out.Free clinics.  Speaking of medical care, the linked website can direct you to free and low-cost healthcare in your area.  In our area we have a few free clinics, a university dental school that offers highly discounted dental care, and if you live in a border area you might be able to save big on medical and dental needs just by crossing the border.Homeless services.  If you google your city/county/state and 'homeless resources' you may find a huge list of resources like the linked list which has info on all kinds of help and resources for those in need (for most things you need not actually be homeless).Veterans resources.  I'm just using veterans as an example but you can google your specific category (elderly resources, Native American resources, addiction help resources, etc) and come up with loads of links for help with your particular issue. 211.  Finally, if you need help with any sort of problem you can call 211.  Kind of like 911 but for non-emergent social service needs, these organization can direct you to resources in your local community."},

The weather went from 90 and sunny to 65 and sunny practically overnight last week.  So far we have held off on turning on the heat by watching TV in the evening under blankets and warming up our bedroom in the evening with a space heater then turning it off before going to bed.  Here are some more ways to keep warm on the cheap.Our lemon tree should be full of yellow lemons by mid November.  I will be back to making lemon bars then!I've always had a hard time recognizing faces (and by hard I mean I can't recognize anyone in a crowd even my husband!).  I took part in a Harvard study years ago on this topic but they couldn't do much for me because I am also on the autism scale.  I recently came across this website which grew out of their initial research and it has a lot of useful information!It's now perfect weather for walking in the desert southwest so I have been trying to walk everyday.Political season is still ongoing and while I did my early voting by mail-in ballot over a week ago, I am still being inundated with mailers/email/texts/and calls by candidates.  I'll be glad when election day rolls around next week.Speaking of next week, don't forget to set your clock back next Sunday if you live in an area where this happens.  Fortunately, the whole daylight savings time thing in the US may become a non-issue next year.Meanwhile...utilities are still rising in price, groceries are both shrinking in size AND rising in price, and gas, which was decreasing in price, has now turned around and the price per gallon is rising again  :("},

{"title": "It's DIY Time!", "date": "Monday, October 10, 2022", "text": "With the prices on everything rising, customer service becoming more shoddy by the day, the aforementioned long lines, etc, I think many people are opting to DIY (do it yourself) as much as possible.  I know we are.  Here's what we have done lately...Instead of going out to eat, we almost always cook at home these days.  Today I was thinking about Mexican food but instead of going to our favorite Mexican restaurant, hubby whipped up some of his tasty guacamole and we made little guacamole tacos for lunch.Hubby will cut my hair tomorrow.  He does a great job and after my last messed up haircut at the salon, I think this may be a permanent option instead of having him cut my hair in between salon cuts.Hubby and I washed our car this morning.  The car was pretty dirty after the rains we had a few weeks ago so instead of spending $12 at the carwash, we just decided to do it ourselves and save the money.  It was easy to do, it was good exercise, and it didn't take very long to finish.Probably the most impressive thing we did recently was to reline hubby's dentures.  Instead of flying across the country to have his sister in law, who is a dentist, do this, we watched a few how-to videos on YouTube and ordered the reline kit then did the whole simple process ourselves.  It tightened up the dentures, saved us several hundred dollars, and judging by the number of people watching the DIY videos and ordering the reline products, this process that used to only be done by dentists is now a viable, money-saving, DIY option.  On a side note, according to the SIL, it is important to get to the dentist eventually because the shape of your dental ridges change over time, dentures wear down, and DIYing your own dental work can cause bite and other problems.  So YMMV."},

A lot of people in my city got a photo of this sunset sky last night (I'm always looking up at the sky I'm not sure how I missed it!).  Of course everyone started talking about nuclear attacks...eeekkk  The photo above is from a sunset a few nights ago.A new family just moved in across the street and they are so nice!  They just moved here from India and the wife is the best cook.  She sends me over yummy Indian food like upma for breakfast (see photo below, they come from a southern India state where all of their food is super hot and spicy!) and I send over baked goods like cakes and cookies.  I may never have to go to an Indian restaurant again--her food is way better than we can find in any restaurant here!  Gas is getting stupid expensive here again :( It's kind of faint, but the price is $5.81 a gallon!Speaking of food, I finally used some of the chickpeas I cooked to make hummus and falafel and I still have several more cups to use which I put in the freezer for now.  A one pound bag of chickpea makes A LOT of cooked chickpeas!  I hope none of you were impacted by Hurricane Ian.  I was watching Ryan Hall and several storm chasers for hours on end during the storm.  What an incredible amount of damage in Florida!  FWIW, here is how to prepare for a hurricane.Does it seem like everywhere you go there are long lines?  It sure seems like it here--lines for groceries and other shopping, lines at Walmart and Sam's Club, lines at restaurants and then when you get to a real person, it seems like customer service is sadly lacking.  Sometimes I feel like an alien in my own country like these people.Speaking of this topic, here are several things that used to be normal that are now considered luxuries.  Ayayay I was talking to an elderly man when I was in line at the bank--yes, another line with about 30 people and only two tellers :(  and he was telling me about how he had to move recently because his rent was increased so much he couldn't make it on his social security so he was working a part time job (he looked to be late 70s) and had to find a cheaper place to live.  It's terrible to see seniors priced out of their homes with basically nowhere to go.It's still hot here!  It's still in the mid 90s and our air conditioning is still running :(  Our electric bill keeps going up, up, up and so does our water bill.  I am guessing our gas bill (which we use for heating) will follow suit later in the year when we turn on the heat.  Everything seem to be going up in price!  It's a common topic of discussion on most social media boards these days.It's political season and we are being swamped with political/candidate ads--on TV, on the radio, in the mailbox, and even as text messages on our cell phones!  I will be happy when the mid-terms are done.I guess I should have titled this 10 rants from this weekend..."},

{"title": "10 Things from This Week", "date": "Saturday, September 17, 2022", "text": "In no particular order...We had a great monsoon season this summer!  Rain, clouds, even flash floods, but now the weather is settling down and it is nice and warm--not hot--so hopefully we will have a nice fall (and hopefully we won't need to use the AC or heat for a month or more which will save money on electricity!).I love this list of odd things, several of which I think I need to buy!Here are some good ways to get glasses or contacts without a recent prescription.I'm debating whether or not to delete my Facebook account.  It is not a good company (examples here, here, and here), their algorithm is whack (I clicked like on one fishing picture, now I get nearly 100 fishing pictures a day on my feed ?!?), and I believe that some of my factually correct (I site my sources) yet politically incorrect comments are simply not shown to anyone.  It's extremely biased and overly invasive (even with browser isolation) so I am looking into other ways to connect with people so I can leave Facebook in the dust.The same with Blogger which is owned by Google.  I inherited another blog/website from an old client many years ago which I still keep updated.  Imagine my surprise when I logged in a couple weeks ago and several posts and one page had been unpublished (there is no way to hit publish on them now) because they were contrary to their terms of service.  These posts had been on the blog for nearly ten years and NOW they are contrary to Bloggers terms of service?  And they weren't even on controversial topics so that was weird so I may be looking at other hosts for all of my Blogger blogs including this one.  I did a quick search and I guess it is common for Google to censor Blogger blogs.Speaking of tech, OSINT is a new hot-button tech issue.  OSINT stands for Open Source Intelligence and it's a way to scan, parse, and aggregate all of the info people post online which can then be used against the person in shocking and scary ways.  Here is a good explanation about why this is/will become a serious issue.Customer service is still god-awful.  My neighbor asked me to swing buy a fast food place on our way home and pick up lunch for her kids so we stopped by a restaurant, went up to the door, and found it locked.  Several places in our city have kind of perma-closed their dining rooms either because they can't find staff or don't pay well enough to attract staff so they go to drive-thru only.  There was a sign on the door, which we couldn't read because the writing was facing the inside of the restaurant, and it was posted upside down (we looked through the facing window to read it) which said no more dining room, just drive-thru for now.  I mean, people can't even post a sign correctly???  ayayayOn September 24, all National Parks will have free entry.  I checked our state parks website and our state will have free entry to all state parks on that day as well in honor of National Public Lands Day.I spend way too much time online.  I really need to get out and move more which is now possible since the weather isn't hotter than the surface of the sun.  Also, spending so much time online is not good for my stress levels; it seems like all news is bad news and most interactions with others online, like on reddit or Facebook, devolves into a flame war over the stupidest of topics.  eeekkkFinally, hubby and I went to the dining hall at the local military base last week and had a very nice, and very inexpensive, lunch.  For some reason we never thought to check this place out because at other bases we had been to, their dining facilities were only open to active duty personnel.  We were pleasantly surprised that this base opens their dining facility to active duty, retired and DOD/base personnel.  And the food was actually very good!"},

{"title": "Old, Broke, and...Homeless?", "date": "Saturday, September 10, 2022", "text": "This topic of aging, being broke, and ending up homeless has been top of mind for a while now.  Ever since I started watching the Cheap RV Living videos on YouTube and realized that a majority of people Bob features on his channel are living in their vehicles by circumstance and not by choice, it made me wonder where me, my friends, the kids, and grandkids could end up when we get older.  Scary stuff!  Then I saw this post over at Barbara's blog and it kind of reinforced the idea that people--all people--need a plan so they don't end up homeless in their old age.  Obviously this \"have a plan\" idea has a lot of limitations.  If you are already old, you really don't have time to make significant changes to suddenly give yourself a fat and fluffy retirement income.  On the other hand, if you are young, the days of robust pension plans for your old age are pretty much gone now.  EeekkkSo where does that leave us?  In our case, we are doing fine financially now as hubby has two pensions plus social security coming in.  However (a big however!) is that all of this money will stop when he dies and if he dies before me (he is 20 years older than I am) I will be toast financially.  Not completely, but it sure is nice to have a good chunk of guaranteed monthly income for the rest of your life as we have now.My plan so far...we are working diligently to pay off the house.  Not having to pay a mortgage or rent is a huge deal if you are on a limited income.we have been looking at the idea of selling our house (we have quite a bit of equity in it at this point) and moving to a state with a lower cost of living then just buying a small house with cash and banking the rest.we have also considered selling the house, moving to a LCOL area, and buying a bigger house so the kids and grandkids could move in if needed as some of them are in precarious financial positions right now.  Since I don't really want to live with a bunch of people 24/7 we have also considered moving to a LCOL area and buying enough land that they could put RVs or tiny houses on it if they needed a cheap place to live then we could build a house on the same property to suit our needs.  we have considered living in the Philippines where hubby is originally from but, even though it would be cheaper to live there, it would be financially disastrous because he has A LOT of relatives there and any time someone had a financial emergency he would be obliged to help them then we would end up broke.we are saving money every month so at least I would have a few years of financial cushion to figure out what I would want to do if the worst happens.we live frugally now and I could cut back even more if needed so I guess these are good skills to develop in case worse comes to worst.my social security will kick in in about ten years (if it is still a solvent program then!). I *could* live in a van or RV which is a cheaper way to live but we have had an RV before and while it is great for traveling and vacations, I wouldn't want to live in one full time.  Plus, what happens when one gets too sick or too old to drive or the vehicle needs to be replaced (have you seen the cost of vehicles these days???)?I could move in with the kids, grandkids (several are adults now), family or friends (one friend decided that I WILL live with her in my old age but I like my privacy even though she is a very sweet lady).  Again, at this point I don't really want to live with roommates (once in college was enough!) but apparently many older people are doing this as a way to save money. I am trying my hand at investing, so far it is unclear how this will work out.  I've almost always worked for myself so never had the opportunity to have a pension but I would like some sort of investment income so I have put money into a mutual fund and put a bit of money into buying individual stocks.I could always go back to work or start another business.  While I like doing small project contract work which I still do on occasion, I don't really like the idea of a full time job or working non-stop to get another business started.I could rent out the guest rooms in our house either to roommates or through Air BnB.  Again, these can be good sources of income but I don't really want to have strangers--or anyone--in my house long term.we carry no debt and our car is paid off.  And we intend to keep it that way.  Having debt payments every month on top of regular living expenses would be expensive, horrible and very stressful!I watch a lot of videos on how not to be homeless or what to do if you become homeless so I guess that is a good way to have some skills if I end up in a bad situation.other ways to give myself more options: improve my health (better to be healthy than be too ill to function if one is cast into a precarious financial situation.  A lot of physically and mentally ill people are just dumped onto the streets these days even if they can't really take care of themselves).  Also, maintaining and improving relationships means you will always have someone to take you in during a crisis.  I keep up with marketable job skills just in case I need them in the future.  And I am forever watching how-to videos on YouTube in case I need to build out a van or build a make-shift cabin in the woods...never know when those skills will come in handy!On an unrelated note, you can get free museum tickets here for Museum Day next Saturday and here is $5 off on a haircut."},

scored into half sheets then cut them in half down the center before we hang them up to make quarter-sized sheets.  Needless to say, this saves a lot of paper towels!  (see photo above)Since I started using a bidet, we haven't bought toilet paper in several months.  A bidet saves A LOT of toilet paper!I don't decorate seasonally anymore.  I used to have a ton of crap to change the décor of our house by the season.  We got rid of all of that stuff when we downsized and now our house looks the same year-round (you can save a lot of money when you don't buy useless crap just to impress people!).We never buy garbage bags, instead I line all of our waste cans with plastic shopping bags from the grocery store (however I am looking at ways to stop using plastic all together).I never use Swiffer products, Lysol wipes, and things like that as bleach water and a rag works just as well.The makeup I use is pretty basic and of the cheaper Cover Girl variety and if we aren't leaving the house for the day, I don't put on makeup at all.  I think I went several months during the pandemic without wearing any makeup at all which saved a lot of money (even cheap makeup is pretty expensive these days!).When I open a new box of dryer sheets, I take them out of the box and cut them in half thus doubling my supply of dryer sheets.I also use a fraction of the \"recommended\" amount of liquid laundry soap in each load.  Our clothes aren't really dirty so there is no need to use massive amounts of soap--our clothes come out just as clean while using much less soap.  It's the same when using bleach.Similarly I use just a little shampoo not a big glob, and only use a tiny bit of conditioner every few days instead of everyday.I use a small amount of toothpaste (much smaller than the picture of the toothpaste box!) but will happily buy as much floss as necessary since it pays to keep your gums healthy and cavities at bay.When our bath soap gets down to a sliver I \"meld\" it on to the new bar instead of throwing it out.Since I am no longer working, I rarely wear perfume, cologne, use nail polish, etc.All of our TVs are at least a decade old.  While there are huge sales on bigger and better TVs every week, it doesn't make sense (cents?) to get rid of perfectly good TVs that are big enough for a good viewing experience and still work fine.We buy the majority of our medical kit stuff from the Dollar Store.  Gauze is the same, no matter if you pay $1 for it at the Dollar Store or $5 for it at Target.  However, if I buy ingestible like eye drops or vitamins at the Dollar Store, I read the package to make sure they come from a reputable country like Korea not China.I used to use Garnier Nutrisse hair color but now that it is $10 a box, I switched to a $3 Revlon color which produces the same results.Speaking of hair, hubby cuts my hair a couple times in between professional cuts so I only pay for maybe four haircuts a year (and often use coupons when I do).I do all of my own beauty services at home too--manicures, pedicures, waxing, facials, etc.I like to wear my clothes until they are threadbare then throw them away or use them for rags.  For clothes that I don't want but that are still in good condition, I give them away to people that need them.Speaking of clothes, ALL of my clothes except for sox and underwear come from the Goodwill.  I love wearing already used clothes, it's much cheaper than buying new, and it keeps unwanted clothing out of landfills.I try to use tech items for a few years then pass them along to others.  Some years ago I bought an $800 laptop which I thought was super expensive at the time but I used it for four years then our daughter used it for four years so I definitely think it was worth the money.Speaking of tech, I like to buy tried and true items instead of leading edge items (I didn't buy the original Z Fold cell phone because I was sure it would need a lot of bugs worked out.  I am considering picking up the Z Fold 4--on sale of course--because there have been enough iterations to make it a much better device than the first version).Another way we keep our tech and other items working for a good long time is to make repairs ourselves.  You can find YouTube videos on how to repair nearly everything and you can buy cheap parts on Amazon in order to greatly expand the lifespan of your stuff.  So far I have copied a programmable key fob, repaired a dryer, replaced a keyboard on a laptop, and replaced the battery on a laptop.I buy things like shoes, backpacks, etc. with longevity in mind.  I buy expensive, high-quality shoes which I then wear for years.  I had a pair of Brooks shoes that I paid $80 for that lasted for ten years which makes their actual cost $8 per year!  My Teva sandals have lasted a similarly long time.The carpet in our house is more than ten years old and still looks new.  Between a no-shoes-in-the-house policy, semi-annual shampoos, and using plastic runners in high-traffic areas, we don't have to replace the carpet nearly as often as other people.  I am looking at hardwood floors when the carpet does need to be replaced for even better flooring longevity.I like to keep my eye on the sales websites so I can get deeply discounted prices on things I know we will use eventually like furnace filters (we replace these every six months), batteries (we don't use too many, usually only for our computer mice), bug spray (we do our own spring and fall spraying for beetles and scorpions with Hot Shot), etc.  I hate food waste so we freeze leftovers to eat at a later date when we don't feel like cooking and want a quick meal.Since switching from bottled water to refilling five gallon jugs of water, we have saved a lot of money as well as a lot of plastic waste.Hubby makes his own coffee at home everyday using a $4 drip coffeemaker that we got at the Goodwill--this is much cheaper than using a Keurig (everyone we know uses these) and much much cheaper than hitting up Starbucks everyday.Whenever we leave the house, we bring our own drinks in insulated Contigo travel mugs.If we will be out and about for a while, we usually bring a lunch with us as well (usually sandwiches in reusable plastic containers or fried rice/soup in an insulated tumbler).Instead of using a lot of plastic wrap, we save leftovers, cut onions, etc. in reusable plastic containers.Instead of using aluminum foil to heat up things in the toaster oven, we reuse foil pie pans we got at the Dollar Store--these can last for months!Every six months, we take everything out of our freezers and rotate the items to make sure nothing gets forgotten for years in the back of the freezer.I clean out our refrigerator once a week to ensure nothing gets forgotten in the back of the fridge and is eaten in a timely manner.We often do batch cooking and freeze the results.  It super easy to make 100 lumpia, a huge batch of chili, cups of smoothies and frozen desserts, etc. and freeze the results to use when we want a quick meal or snack.I like to cook as many things from scratch as possible--chili, soups, cookies, etc.  This way I know what is in the product (no fillers, chemicals, etc), it's cheaper (my neighbor pays $5 per cookie at a fancy local bakery!), and it usually tastes better too!Instead of deciding what to have for dinner then going to the store to buy the food to make the meal, I check out the sale ads and build our meals around loss leaders and other sale items.  I hate paying full price for groceries!I generally buy products like laundry soap, dish soap, Windex, and hand soap in huge bulk containers then just refill the smaller containers that we use daily.We also buy meat in bulk when it comes on sale (we got 10 pounds of London Broil for $2.74 a pound yesterday--hubby breaks it down and freezes it in individual portions, this should last him for months!), oats in bulk at Sam's Club (I eat oatmeal every morning for breakfast), huge bags of pancake mix when we know we will be having lots of guests visiting, etc. One thing I haven't tried yet that I am considering is this idea from Prepper Princess about making your own solar power to run things like computers and TVs on.  We have plenty of sun here and with the way power prices are skyrocketing, this may be a great money-saving idea.Another idea I got from the PP channel is to just not buy things.  While you can save money by being frugal with your consumables, you can save even more money by not buying these items in the first place!Gas is a consumable that we try really hard to conserve.  At least two days a week we stay home and don't drive anywhere.  When we do drive somewhere we usually try to group several errands together in order to save gas.On consumer items that we need but which continue to rise in cost--like cell service, insurance, internet, etc--I regularly call around to different companies in order to get the lowest-priced plans I can find.  Mint Mobile has great prices, we have the lowest price internet plan our local provider offers, etc.For some consumables, I like to use coupons if at all possible.  I don't often find coupons for the basic items we use--like store brand shampoo for hubby instead of the higher priced name brand shampoo which, even with using a coupon, would cost more than the store brand--occasionally I will find a good coupon to use.  I also use other methods for saving money on the items we buy like asking for a rain check for a low-priced grocery item that is on sale but not in stock, asking a nearby store to price-match an item that the store across town has on sale, buying an open-box item instead of a new item, etc.While hubby is a carnivore, I am vegan about 95% of the time.  I think this a healthier way to eat and it is much cheaper to eat beans, whole grains, fruit, and vegetables than lots of meat and dairy. Speaking of eating, where you shop can make a lot of difference on prices.  We get a lot of our vegetables, for really cheap, at our local Mexican grocery stores.  You would think rice would be cheaper at Asian supermarkets but we have found it to be cheaper at Sam's Club.  The 99 Cent store has great prices on day-old bread and produce. Hubby likes to watch recipe channels on YouTube and is always up for trying to make something new.  A way we save money with this is by sometimes making substitutions.  For example, one Filipino dish (kare kare) says to use oxtail and honeycomb tripe but both kinds of meat are very expensive.  Instead he will buy a cheaper kind of beef like chuck roast and a cheaper kind of tripe and the recipe usually turns out good anyway.Of course it is a good idea to break any addiction you have to alcohol, smoking, etc, to save money but I find it difficult (impossible?) to shake my addiction to a particular coffee drink at Baskin Robbins.  To save money on this item, I do the survey on the bottom of each receipt to save a dollar of my next drink and do their 'buy eight get one free' punch cards.Finally, we try to follow the 'reduce, reuse, recycle, or do without' thing.  For each item we need to spend money on, we ask ourselves if there is a way to reduce, reuse, or recycle something to meet our needs or if, in fact, we can just do without the item."},

{"title": "5 Things from This Week", "date": "Friday, August 12, 2022", "text": "In no particular order...We are still experiencing some wild monsoon weather.  Examples here, here, and here.I went online to lift the credit freezes I have on my accounts at the big three credit reporting agencies yesterday.  I'm opening another investment account and didn't know if they needed to check my credit or not so I figured it would take a few minutes to log into each account and temporarily suspend the freezes.  Two hours and one near panic attack later, things got worked out.  The first two log-ins were no problem, the last one I tried to log in to said I had the wrong user name and password so I clicked on forgot username and it said they would send a link to my email...only the email they showed was not for my email account!  About the only way to get ahold of the company was through a phone tree that first asked for my birthdate and social security number but it kept saying my entries were wrong!  I had flashes of a multi-month process to get my accounts back from a hacker as I frantically dialed every number I could find for the company.  Finally I got a guy in marketing who transferred me to a real person and he got all of my account details back in my name.  For about an hour, I was really freaking out!  On a happy note, it didn't seem like my credit had been hacked as all of my info was correct and it showed I was two points away from a perfect credit score!  Lesson: check your credit reports for free EVERY year (I hadn't accessed these accounts in probably two or three years).We are still on track with our cash-only challenge this month.  In our shopping today in which we only bought loss leaders, we saved 69% over the regular cost of the food--the cashiers are always shocked when they hit total and see all of the money dropping off of our amount due.My friend's daughter has been sick for about two and a half years.  Like fever, body aches, and other symptoms, everyday, for two and a half years.  She has seen doctor after doctor, and was even brought into the Mayo clinic for testing and still no results.  Finally yesterday she got a call that it is probably a rare cancer that less than a thousand people in the whole country have.  So she will have more tests to confirm this...meanwhile my friend and I spent a few hours pouring over what research we could find on the disease and found that while cancer is a terrifying diagnosis, this sort--if this is what she actually has--is super slow growing, has a good long-term prognosis, and treatment options aren't horrible.I'm trying to avoid the news, as well as several subreddits like this, because everything is so stressful and depressing.  I can feel my blood pressure rise with each article that is worse than the last!"},

{"title": "10 Things...An Update", "date": "Thursday, August 4, 2022", "text": "I woke up early this morning, looked out the window, and saw this beautiful sunrise!  In other news...We have been cash-only since the 1st and hubby is fully on board.  He took out a chunk of money and put it in his money belt that he usually uses for traveling, and seems mildly amused with this challenge.  We are definitely being more careful with our spending when we have to pay cash for stuff!I was shocked and disappointed that the cost to fill up our 5 gallon water jug jumped from $1.75 to $2.50 over the course of one week.  Not sure why this happened but it seems like a significant increase in a short amount of time.People are freaking out on our local subreddit because their electric bills have gone through the roof.  Some are saying their electric bills increased $100 or more over the same period last year.  We have noticed an increase of about $40 over the same period last year.  I'm tempted to get a solar set up like this couple did to power our household appliances!Speaking of increasing prices, the great price we had on our internet plan expired at the end of last month so we went with their lowest price internet plan which costs $10 more for a lower speed plan :(We haven't eaten out this week; it's much cheaper to eat at home so that is what we are doing.Here are some cute cat pictures.This sounds like a great job opportunity.And this is good information for people just heading into their social security years.This is a pretty scary thing that I noticed way back when Cheap RV Living started showing so many seniors living in their cars.Schools in our area start next Monday.  I was walking through the school supply area of Target today and it certainly brought back memories of when the kids were young!  Also, not to sound like a broken record, but the \"super discounted back to school supply sales\" look like anything but that with a basic spiral notebook on sale for 75 cents--these used to be a quarter a few short years ago!"},
{"title": "Cash-Only August", "date": "Monday, August 1, 2022", "text": "The name of this blog is Cash Only Living because we went cash-only in the early days in order to get out of debt.  Since then, we got out of debt and have (fortunately!) been pretty stable financially so these days we use a credit card for all of our purchases during the month then pay it off in full at the end of the month.  This works great for us because it is more convenient to use a card instead of cash plus it is a cash-back card so we get a little money back each month too.The other day I was listening to this lady on the Dave Ramsey show and I was inspired to do a cash-only month.  It has been years since we used only cash for all of our purchases so I decided that starting today, we will only use cash for all of our purchases this month.I went to a couple stores this morning and it actually felt weird paying cash (even the cashier looked at me oddly when I handed her cash instead of using my credit card).  Like the lady in the video said, when you are watching every dollar you spend, going into the store is like a mission, not a relaxing walk.  I had a shopping list, I went directly to the aisles where the things I needed were located, and I didn't even check the clearance racks so I think this cash-only thing is already saving us money!My goals for this month are to save money (I think having to hand over cash will make me less likely to throw extra stuff in the shopping basket since I will have a limited amount of cash and don't want to use the emergency cash I always carry with me), make my purchases untraceable (all of the transactions on your cards are tracked, traced, and bundled up by data brokers and sold to the highest bidder), and cut out buying things that we really don't need (while not excessive, we seem to buy a lot of extra stuff that we don't really need and now we have a lot of stuff piling up in the garage that we need to clean out and donate to the Goodwill).  Wish me luck!On another note, here are some good travel infographics, we have been in full-on monsoons season this week (it even rained INSIDE the casinos), and I have been perusing r/frugal a lot lately looking for even more ideas on how to save money!"},

{"title": "10 Ways I Saved Money This Week", "date": "Thursday, July 21, 2022", "text": "First off, it's hot here this week!In other news, we did quite a few things to save money this week including...I've been looking for a really good 8 inch tablet since the tablet I currently carry with me everywhere is getting a bit old and slow.  While I am not a fan of Apple products at all, they are the only company making high-end 8\" tablets so when I saw the iPad mini 6 tablet was $100 off at Best Buy, I decided to pick one up.  I also saw that Target, which is much closer to me than Best Buy, does price matching so not only did I save $100 on my new tablet, I asked for price-matching at my nearby Target and saved the gas I would have used driving across town to Best Buy!Hubby trimmed my hair so I can put off getting a professional haircut for another several weeks.  He often does this since my hair grows so fast but I don't like to pay for a professional cut every month.I used the app on my phone plus the weekly sale flyer for our local grocery store to save more than 50% off the cost of groceries this week.  We pretty much only buy sale items and loss leaders when we shop which saves A LOT of money over paying full price for a bunch of groceries like other shoppers.  Peaches were 99 cents a pound this week so we will have peaches instead of strawberries which weren't on sale this week.  They also had pork chops on sale for 97 cents a pound so hubby stocked up on these as pork is the kind of meat he likes the best (it's used in many Filipino dishes that he cooks).I needed some basic make up so I checked the price for eye liner, brow liner, and powder at Walmart and found the price has really increased so I ordered these items on Amazon and saved more than $10 that way.Our car insurance is up for renewal next month so I called a couple of other companies and found that the company we use now is still the least expensive so I happily paid for six months (we also get a discount for paying our car insurance for six months at a time instead of on a monthly basis).Our internet plan is also coming up for renewal (we got a great discount deal which is set to expire after one year) so I called the internet company to see if we could renew for the same price.  Unfortunately the lady said she couldn't match that price so I am now looking around for other options (we might switch to Verizon or TMobile 5g home services if I can't find a good cable price).We skipped shopping at the Goodwill this week.  Since we ALWAYS find stuff to buy there but we really don't need anything, we try to hit the Goodwill only once or twice per month instead of every week.I try to cook at home as much as possible and when we do eat out, it is usually free except for the tip because hubby gets comps from the casinos for playing poker.  This week we had a nice dinner at Saltgrass Steakhouse for the grand total of a $7 tip.  And today I am going to make Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana for hubby which is much cheaper to make at home than ordering it at a restaurant.The bidet is still working great and it saves A LOT of toilet paper!For several years we have only drank bottled water as the tap water here is pretty awful but when I realized how much plastic waste we were creating, I decided to try buying the five gallon water jugs that I always see people filling up at the water station in front of the grocery store.  Since doing this a few months ago, we have saved a lot of money AND plastic waste and the water tastes great! I simply put the water into a smaller pitcher we keep in the refrigerator and use this for drinking and to fill up our steel water bottles that we always take with us.  The price to fill up the 5 gallon jugs is only $1.75 and it's really easy to do!And a few other things... Here are some funny and interesting charts.The bear cams on YouTube Live are fascinating to watch!Finally, here is a great place to find all kinds of frugal tips."},
{"title": "My EDC (Everyday Carry) Kit", "date": "Tuesday, July 19, 2022", "text": "I am fascinated with EDC (everyday carry) kits on YouTube.  Mostly because I love gadgets and tech and always being prepared for anything that could happen.  On the flip side, watching all of the EDC videos makes me want to buy all of the latest and coolest gadgets and bags.  Bellroy bags are very cool (but they are also $300!) and I would love to get a Hero clip (which is a very expensive carabiner...obviously not a necessity).  So for now I just try to minimize the stuff I carry to the most basic, most useful stuff that I use the most often.  Right now my kit includes:A bag.  This is a small Kipling backpack but I have about a dozen bags I use depending on the situation including sling bags, small backpacks, big backpacks, purses, fanny packs, etc.Tablet.  This is a Tab A 8.4 which is a small tablet with just OK specs.  I would LOVE a high end 8 inch Android tablet but they really don't make them anymore.Packet of tissue.Wallet with my driver's license, military ID, and credit cards for three separate bank accounts (one for daily purchases, one for big purchases, and one that I use to pay bills with).Earbuds.  These are middle-of-the-road earbuds but I just ordered much better Galaxy buds which should arrive sometime this week.A tiny ziploc bag of cough drops and mints for hubby (I tend to carry many of his EDC things because he doesn't like to put stuff in his pockets so I just carry the things he uses most often).A flat thing of dental floss (I don't think they make these tiny sample size floss dispensers anymore since I can't find them anywhere).Flowery blue LeSportsac bag used to hold all of these EDC items.Sunglasses (a cheap pair from Ross which I use everyday because it is so sunny here!).Keys.A tiny ziploc bag of hearing aid batteries for hubby because they seem to always run out of batteries when we are out and about.A couple of bandaids.A tiny ziploc bag that contains hubby's morning pills (sometimes when we are out and about we remember that he didn't take his pills so this keeps him on track so he won't miss any of his pills).A tiny ziploc bag containing a glucose tablet (hubby is diabetic so if his blood sugar crashes this will bring it back up in a hurry).A tiny ziploc bag that contains a short piece of nail file which I cut off from a big nail file (I hate having jagged nails!).A tiny ziploc bag containing hubby's evening pills (same reason as above).A tampon (for emergencies...you would be surprised at how many women in public bathrooms ask if anyone has a spare tampon).A wet wipe (these seem to get used most often to clean up sticky fingers).An alcohol wipe (generally used with the bandaids).A safety pin.A Fisher Space Pen (it's tiny and works really well!).A tiny flashlight.Four quarters.A pocket knife (I've had this knife for about 40 years, mostly used to open Amazon boxes).A type c thumb drive which I keep a backup of all of my computer files on (I try to back this up at least weekly).A tiny tube of Fixodent for hubby.Lipstick.Brow liner (for emergency eyebrow fixes...my eyebrows are so light that if they get \"erased\" they require an emergency fix!).Packet of Tylenol.A tiny ziploc bag of matches (rarely ever used but smaller than carrying a lighter).Cash (I usually carry about $150 in cash just for emergencies).My cell phone (which I used to take the picture).  It's a Galaxy S10 which is perfect for my needs.  I like the specs but have been debating if I need a newer cell phone but, #1, I don't want to spend $1000 on a good cell phone and #2, I only keep about six apps on my phone as I hardly use it for anything but calling, texting, and taking pictures; I don't even use social media on it!That's all that I carry with me on a daily basis.  I have an \"EDC\" type bag for walking and hiking which I will do a separate post about since the contents are different."},

A monitor.  This one is a 1080p 20\" monitor which I set up for hubby months ago.  I got a larger monitor for this set up but it was too big so I gave it to hubby and took his which makes viewing easier when I am sitting so close to it.  This one cost about $100 at Best Buy.A webcam.  I got a basic 1080p Logitech webcam from Best Buy on sale for $30.  It works fine, but maybe it is too clear because when I look at my face in the camera I feel the need for plastic surgery!Logitech computer speakers which I got on sale at Target for $15.  I am not editing music or doing high end gaming so I just need basic speakers and these work fine.A mouse and mouse pad which I have had for ages, it is a Logitech basic mouse which cost around $10.A small, wireless no-name keyboard which works great for $12.  I didn't want a full-size keyboard with the number pad on it because I only type on it a few times a month and wanted to save space.  I'm surprised at how nice this keyboard is even though it was so cheap!A no-name USB hub that ties the entire system together which cost $20 on Amazon.  The hub allows you to plug a bunch of devices into a central device which then plugs into the laptopMy laptop is central to the whole setup, it is a Lenovo C940 i7 laptop that I have had for a few years.I got a great deal on the power strip from Target which included three strip/adapters for $11.I have had the headphones (which are hanging on the right side of the desk) for several months.  They are JBL 500BTs which cost about $40 on sale from Amazon and they work great!Overall this system works great for Zoom meetings or even reading and editing documents on a large screen.  I didn't want two devices--a laptop and a separate desktop--so this set up works perfectly for my needs!In other news, it is windy AF here in Las Vegas today.  The blowing dust is so bad I can barely see a hundred yards in front of me and my walk this morning was miserable and quick because it was so windy and dusty.  Apparently the rest of the country isn't faring very well either, I have been watching storm chasers on YouTube today as they search for tornadoes and other scary weather across the eastern part of the US!  eeekkk"},

{"title": "Preparedness and Other Things", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2022", "text": "When gas prices go from this......to this within one day, you know there is a problem! Which brings us to the topic of preparedness...At this point, I don't know which disaster to prepare for first!  There is sky rocking gas prices which leads to massive food price increases, weather disasters, a national and global supply chain break which impacts nearly every product on the shelves, housing costs that are quickly rising out of reach for a majority of the population, huge increases in violence/suicide/drug use...oh, and the growing threat of global thermonuclear warfare.  eeekkkSince it looks like disaster is lurking on every corner these days, our preparedness activities are now focused on the following:We started a tiny garden.  We have a tiny yard and rough growing conditions in the desert so obviously there is no way we could grow all of our own food, but it seems like even growing a little food is a good hobby.  I'm also going to give regrowing food scraps a try.We got rid of all of our backpacking gear years ago when we made a major move but now I am checking prices on basic camping gear (tent, sleeping bags, stove, etc) because there are many kinds of disasters that could force us out of our home so it would be a good idea to have a way to shelter and take care of ourselves if we couldn't stay in our house.I'm also looking at small solar power systems.  If the power goes out for an extended period of time, especially in the middle of summer, we would be toast (literally!).  A couple of solar panels and a battery bank would at least give us some power for our basic needs (keeping us and our food cool mostly).We are stockpiling food like crazy.  We have more than six month's worth of food stored at this point and continue to add to our food stocks with every grocery store visit we make (usually stocking up on loss leaders and sale items).Keeping more cash with us.  We always use credit/debit cards for all of our purchases (paid off monthly on cash reward cards) so we rarely use cash.  But with the possibility of cyber warfare that could shut down online banking/ATMs for an extended period of time, having cash on hand seems like a good idea.Focusing more on our health.  The best way to stay healthy and not need medication/hospitals/etc is to focus on eating well (this is a work in progress) and exercise (I have more than 100k in walks scheduled for the next two weeks).  Buying stuff in bulk that we will need in the future.  With prices on everything rising and supply chain issues increasing, it is a good idea to have a lot more supplies--from toiletries to disposable items like furnace filters to cleaning supplies to clothing--on hand.I'm sure there are many more things we can do but at least we are making a start.  Generally, we just try to live life day by day, enjoying ourselves as we go along.  I try to limit the amount of news I watch every day as it is so sad and depressing, but I still want to be proactive when possible in order to avert disaster."},
{"title": "10 Things from Today", "date": "Monday, March 21, 2022", "text": "It was a busy but productive day today!We went to the DMV to transfer the SIL's car to us.  She left the car here a few years ago and doesn't want it back so...we have a new car?  Actually she only uses it when she is here a few times a year but since she decided not to move here she would need to move the car across the country to register it in her new state so she said we can just keep it.  We were able to save $65 on the registration with a veteran's tax exemption that hubby gets from our state government.Next was the military pharmacy to pick up a boatload of hubby's meds.  Total cost: $0.  Thank goodness hubby's mom more or less forced him into the military 50+ years ago.  The benefits he earned have lasted a lifetime!We got gas on the military base for $4.85 a gallon which is a lot better than the $5.39 a gallon at the stations near our house.  I think Costco and Sam's Club have equally cheap gas but the lines there have been super long!Then it was on to the base commissary.  We got everything we needed although the prices have been rising there the same as grocery prices in off-base stores.  It's incredible how high food prices have become!  Right along with supply chain issues off-base stores are facing, we saw the same at the commissary.  Speaking of grocery shopping, we have been noticing a lot of shrinkflation at our grocery stores as well. The weather has been absolutely beautiful this week although a bit windy--which blows pollen and dust around and is causing allergy issues for everyone!I was watching Dave Ramsey on YouTube today and this show made an excellent point--we all need to ensure our car and house insurance keeps up with current values (I will check on this for our accounts tomorrow!).I decided not to work the World Series of Poker this summer.  While I usually really enjoy the job, my tolerance for people is low (maybe since the pandemic?), the new location is awful (middle of the Las Vegas Strip, in summer, very limited parking, massive amounts of traffic getting to and from the location), and I just don't have a good feeling about it this year so I told them I was going to skip working this year.There have been some rumblings about a possible cyberattack in the US.  We have taken basic precautions by stocking up on food, keeping our car gas tank topped off, having cash at home, and backing up all of our computer/financial files.  I am considering buying portable solar panels and a battery bank to use for emergency power but the systems are several hundred dollars (we do have lots of sun though which would pretty much ensure an unending source of power!).I'm going to be 55 years old next month.  eeekkk"},

{"title": "Inflation!", "date": "Monday, February 28, 2022", "text": "Here are some nice flowers to look at as I rant away about inflation.  Hubby and I did our weekly shopping today and noticed the following...Gas in our area looks like it is averaging $4 to $4.10 per gallon.  It was around $3.70 a gallon just a week or so ago!We checked out the Goodwill this morning and hubby was appalled that men's shirts, which used to be priced at $2.99 each, have all been tagged at $6.99 each.  While we get a 40% to 50% discount on nearly everything at the store (military discount, senior discount, daily discount depending on the color of the price tag), he still can't figure out why prices have increased so much there.  And these price increases have been done on nearly everything in the store :(We mailed a couple of flat rate boxes to the kids and grandkids today and what used to cost $10 to $15 to mail has now increased to $15 to $20 depending on the size of the box.  Again, hubby was asking 'when did that happen???'  I usually mail these boxes so I guess he hasn't seen the slow but steady increase in mailing prices lately.We went to the Chinese buffet today and were happily surprised that they haven't increased their prices at all.  It's still $12.99 for a huge buffet that includes a variety of shrimp, clams, fish, and other standard Chinese fare.At Sam's Club hubby and I both sounded like broken records...\"when did that price increase?\", \"didn't this item cost $2 less just a couple weeks ago?\"  It seemed like every item we bought has increased by $1 to $3 dollars in just the past few weeks.At the International Market where we buy our seafood and Asian ingredients, literally everything has gone up in price.  I'm not sure if this is standard inflation or if the extra cost and limited supply is because all of the items are imported from Asia which is having serious supply chain problems.The SIL just ordered a new car.  $86k for a Mercedes SUV which is up nearly $20k for the same car's list price for the 2017 version of the car.  I hope our car lasts another 20 years because the idea of buying any new car these days--which takes months to order, with prices that have gone insanely high, and which dealers are adding every extra fee they can think of to--just sounds like a losing proposition no matter how you look at it.On a happy note, it will reach 80 degrees here this week, it's NASCAR Weekend which is a pretty big deal in Las Vegas, there are still plenty of free entertainment options in Vegas, and our friends and family remain happy and healthy so that is a great thing!"},

Bummer.Also, the Olympics were a dud.  After they let the girl who failed the drug test continue to compete for some unknown reason, we stopped watching the Olympics.  If sports competitions aren't fair it takes all of the fun out of watching them.Finally, Russia attacked Ukraine leading to a full-fledged war between the two countries.  This is leading some people to speculate World War 3 is just around the corner.  EeekkkI don't know whether to ignore the news all together or start putting together a bunker!"},

{"title": "Wrapping Up 2021", "date": "Wednesday, December 29, 2021", "text": "It's been a busy end of the year...Things that are blooming right now--roses and lemons (see photos above).  Our neighbors' lemon trees are all blooming like crazy as well!We've realized that we have saved A LOT of money not traveling the past couple years (we usually did four or five trips a year including at least one cruise per year...when we aren't paying to travel we have a lot of leftover money!).  With the current covid situation ongoing, it doesn't look like we will be cruising or flying anywhere in the near future.Christmas was quiet with just the hubby and I (all of his cousins are elderly and still not wanting to gather with people due to covid).  We went to downtown Las Vegas, walked around checking out the holiday decorations, hubby played poker for a couple hours, then we ate dinner at Salt Grass Steakhouse (free courtesty of hubby's casino comps from playing poker).  It was a perfect, quiet Christmas.We have been getting letters, calls, and emails from realtors and car salesmen wanting to buy our house and car.  The first offer for our car came about a year ago and they wanted to pay us $15k for our 2016 Honda CRV; the latest offer they sent said the would pay us $18k for it!  If I had a lot of cars I would be happy to sell but we only have one car and if we sold our car we would have to pay an exorbitant amount to buy a new car these days so no thank you.  It's the same with our house--we paid $120k a decade ago for it and now it is worth about $360k with a recent offer through a realtor for his client to buy it at $380k.  We said no for the same reason--we would have to pay a fortune to buy a new house since home price are so high just about everywhere so we will just stay here for now.I've been cleaning everything in the house that isn't nailed down.  I like to do a deep cleaning of our house just before the new year, kind of an \"out with the old, in with the new\" thing.  One thing I am buying ASAP is new smoke detectors.  Ours are about 10 years old and I think they are supposed to be replaced every seven years and then I saw this awful story so buying new smoke detectors is now at the top of my shopping list.One of the things we love about living in the desert southwest--no snow.  Our friends and relatives in Portland and Seattle have been hammered with snow this past week which reminds us that while we like watching the snow (online these days), we certainly don't like shoveling the driveway, deicing the car, walking in slush, or pretty much anything else to do with being cold and miserable.  My old bones love the heat and sun these days!Finally, my resolution for the upcoming year is to have no resolutions!  Usually I make an extensive list of new year resolutions, vowing to get iron-man fit, super model beautiful, and somehow become excessively productive and then...nothing happens.  It's disappointing.  So this year I vow to do nothing.  I'm going to take each day as it comes, accept opportunities and invitations to do fun and interesting things as they appear, and enjoy each day!I hope your new year will be happy, prosperous, and ecstatically enjoyable!"},

{"title": "10 Things from This Week", "date": "Wednesday, December 22, 2021", "text": "The week before Christmas is always busy...this is what we have been doing...I got a bunch of cookies, cakes, and brownies made then hubby and I spent a whole day delivering them (nearly everyone has gate guards or gate codes to get into their community then after you get in and go to drop off the treats we need to visit for a bit with everyone...this all took a while!).I was happily surprised to get a Christmas gift from my friend in Japan (see photo above).  We have been sending gifts back and forth for more than 35 years!  She sent me some nice towels, candy, matcha to make tea with, and a tea container.I signed up to volunteer at CrimeCon this year.  While attending these conferences is fun, it can also be expensive so a good way to get in free to many major events in Las Vegas is to volunteer--they get much needed free help and volunteers get a free pass to the event!We don't really have a plan for Christmas but we will probably just stay home and make a small dinner just for us.  We have a friend who is 91 years old and lives alone (her family lives in another state and don't visit often) so we are taking her to do a couple activities during the holidays to keep her busy (she still drives and is very healthy and active but during the holidays her usually activities like bowling leagues are cancelled until after the new year).  This week it is open bowling and a state park, next week it will be a movie and a local history museum.I'm looking at several activities for the upcoming year but with covid, who knows how this will turn out (even CES, a major conference that takes place each year in Las Vegas, looks like it is iffy whether it will go or not).  I would love to go to the Historical Romance Retreat and do the AVA Centurion challenge (100 10k walks, hopefully two per state) but again, so much is still up in the air with the virus :(I found this vest at the Goodwill for $10 yesterday.  It was in like-new condition and I will try wearing it for walking instead of using a daypack.  Such a great find!So far we have resisted buying anything new this season.  Everyday there are a massive amount of \"last minute Christmas gift\" items on sale--everything from tech stuff to appliances to clothes and other nice things but we really don't need anything so despite the \"great deals\", we would rather save money instead of buying things we don't really need.There are shortages of staff everywhere.  I went to get the oil in our car changed yesterday and it took two hours!  The girl who runs the business said she had one mechanic of ten years just up and quit one day, finding new mechanics was really hard, and I guess people have been having a lot of car issues since the waiting room was packed and the phone was ringing off the hook!  Yikes!The winter solstice was yesterday so from here on out each day should be a bit longer and brighter!I hope you and yours are enjoying a wonderful Christmas season!"},

And some other things...We finally had to turn on the heat because it was getting cold!  It was nice having two months of really low utility bills though.Needless to say, we eat out way too much and I am literally addicted to Baskin Robbins coffee drinks  :(I avoided buying anything on Black Friday/Cyber Monday.  I had several things sitting in my Amazon shopping cart but after some thought, I decided I really didn't need the items so deleted everything (and saved myself several hundred dollars!).  I would really like some new high-end earbuds and headphones but in reality I use these things maybe once a month at most so I don't really need these things when the ones I have work perfectly fine for the short time I use them every month.Today is our 31st anniversary!  Hubby and I have been together exactly 35 years (we met the Saturday after Thanksgiving) and married for exactly 31 years--we got married the Friday after Thanksgiving.  In a bowling alley.  In the middle of hubby's bowling league.  It was the most inexpensive wedding ever but it was memorable and all of our friends were there and it was so much fun.We got several freebies this week: a friend gave us a $45 gift card for a grocery store which we used this week for groceries (we bring an elderly lady breakfast once a week when we bowl with her and this week she gave us a nice card and this gift card).  The SIL paid for us to have a nice lunch out this week because we went and claimed her lost jewelry which she was very thankful for.  The SIL also paid for hubby and I to get manicures and pedicures for our anniversary which we had done today (see my nails above).  Hubby also got 16 free games of bowling through one of his bowling leagues so we went bowling yesterday and played a couple of games each.  Needless to say, if we didn't eat out all month and I made coffee drinks at home instead of buying them, we would have probably hit our goal of $500 for spending this month but hubby was still impressed that we spent around $700 this month instead of our usual $1200 to $1500."},

The economy still seems to be going off the rails.  Service everywhere is pretty meh, prices on everything, especially food, seem to go up daily, shortages seem to be everywhere as well (lots of random things we look for at the stores seem light or missing all together--our grocery store is missing many kinds of deli meat and didn't have ANY whole turkeys in stock!).The government giveth, the government taketh away.  I was happy to hear that hubby would get a nice little COLA added to his social security check starting in January.  Then a few days later I saw where his monthly payment for Medicare which is taken out of his Social Security check would also increase dramatically.  Bummer.Finally, I just came across this freebies website and since I need a calendar for next year, I ordered this free calendar which was listed on the website."},

Yikes!).We will probably just send the kids and grandkids money for Christmas.  It's hard to find a lot of things in the stores these days and even Amazon seems backlogged (some items I have ordered recently aren't scheduled to arrive until late November!).  Also the postal service is now both very expensive and very unpredictable when it comes to deliveries (we've mailed some things that have arrived immediately and intact and other things that arrived very late and in boxes that looked like someone danced all over them before delivering them!).Also, I don't know about your area but restaurant service in our area seems dramatically...different...than pre-pandemic times.  Waits are long, service is meh, prices are steadily increasing, food quality is meh...these days I definitely prefer to cook at home than going out to eat.Hubby and I have been watching A LOT of Netflix movies lately.  For $12 dollars a month, it is definitely worth the small monthly fee!I also just paid our annual bill for our cell phones.  We love Mint Mobile as it is only $180 each for a full year of cell phone service (unlimited calls and texts, and 4gb data per month).Finally, Veteran's Day is coming up in a couple of weeks and there are discounts and freebies at all kinds of places for vets.  Hubby is a veteran so we take advantage of many of these great deals!"},
{"title": "The Great Grocery Shrinkray and Other Things", "date": "Friday, October 8, 2021", "text": "Hubby and I were shopping at the military commissary a couple days ago and were excited to see that we could get a container of coffee for only $4.80!  Unfortunately when we got home and compared the coffee to one we had in the pantry, we realized that the coffee we had just bought was only 24 ounces but the older coffee was 30 ounces!  This has been a common problem for years but I really though that containers of coffee always stayed the same :(And other things...Today when we pulled into a parking lot, the guy next to us got out of his car and asked if we could give his car a jump because his battery was dead.  He started hauling out his jumper cables but we quickly grabbed the little jumper box we always keep in our car and had his car started within minutes.  He was pretty surprised that such a small device could jump a car but this is the second time we have used it and both times we were impressed with how well it works.  This is a great tool that everyone should have!Here is a big list of useful websites.  I know of many of these sites but I learned of some sites that I had never heard of before and have added them to my favorites list.  Cool!With our current economic system teetering by a thread, it's always good to learn new skills, like how to live without money.  Hopefully it doesn't come to that but one never knows...Something I have been noticing around Las Vegas as well as other places is people posting their Venmo/Cash App/etc link in public places in the hopes (?) that strangers will send them money.  Apparently this is a thing now?  I've seen this quite often on the back of peoples cars (\"just turned 21 buy me a drink!\") and on Facebook/Twitter/etc.  HmmmDid you know that you can Google 'Halloween freebies' and come up with pages and pages of free stuff?And here is a reminder to check to see if you qualify for any class action rebates.Finally, this weekend I am attending the free Community Safety Forum at the Mob Museum.  If you ever come to Las Vegas when this monthly event is happening, you can sign up to attend the event then get free entry to the Mob Museum (the cost to visit this museum is usually $30!)."},
{"title": "Another Boring Update", "date": "Monday, October 4, 2021", "text": "I haven't been blogging much lately because it has been pretty boring around here!It's still hot here even though it is so late in the year.  I guess climate change is happening right here, right now!  eeekkk  Although I must say the low 90s are somewhat better than 110 degrees!I made the cookies in the picture above a couple nights ago.  I used this recipe and they came out light and crispy and yummy!We continue to shop and stockpile as it seems the supply chain is getting even more wonky as the days go by.  Fortunately we don't need much--mostly food--and the kids and grandkids will get money for Christmas (I am pretty much done with the post office, we haven't had a package arrive on time and intact in ages.  One flat-rate box we sent to the SIL looked like someone danced all over it before delivering it to her several days late!).Doom-scrolling is a thing which I need to stop myself from doing.  It seems like every website I go to has bad news and horrible news and nothing positive or happy these days.  Maybe a complete media/social media break is in order?Speaking of doom-scrolling, I came across this article and it made me think how close so many people are to living in their cars if they get hit by one or two financial disasters.  I would like to think we are in pretty good financial shape but I guess one never knows.  Double yikes!On a happier note, I have been watching a lot of YouTube live cams.  From bears to checking out what is going on in my city to so many other things, this is a great way to see what's happening all over the world without even leaving your house!"},
{"title": "A Few Things from Today", "date": "Saturday, September 25, 2021", "text": "A few things from today...when I go walking, sometimes I will pass by a nearby shopping plaza and when I go by the plaza, I usually stop into the Dollar Tree and stock up on about $10 worth of extra stuff.  With all of the talk about food shortages and supply chain disruptions, I figure it is always good to have extra food and supplies on hand just in case (and if we don't use this stuff after a while, I usually box it up and send it to the Philippines).  Today I stocked up on beans and tuna. from the news...our local water levels have been dropping like crazy and in today's news it was reported that the Colorado River levels may drop so low that the dams on the river may no longer be able to generate power!  Yikes!  I'm trying to get hubby to move but so far he hates the idea.  He will hate summer in the desert without electricity even more!I made a tres leches cake today!  This is the first time I've tried to make it and according to my Mexican neighbors and hubby, it tasted great!  I thought it was ridiculously sugary so if I make it again I might cut back a little on the sugar, especially in the whipped cream.  Also, I forgot to take a picture of the big cake I made before giving it to the neighbor, below is the smaller section I kept for us."},
{"title": "And Five More Things...", "date": "Monday, September 20, 2021", "text": "Here are a few more things I forgot to add to the last post...This Saturday (September 25) is National Public Lands Day which means free entry day to our national parks.  You should also check your state parks website as our state parks are also free on this day.If you are diabetic or diabetes runs in your family (it's super simple to get checked for this) please stay on top of this issue to preserve your health.  My friend called me last week and told me her mom had to have her foot cut off due to her chronic diabetes (gangrene sets in and then no more foot :(  Diabetes also affects a person's vision and kidneys in a really bad way).  EeeekkkPrepare for cold and flu season ASAP.  Again, with covid and the many supply chain issues, I went out this past weekend and picked up extra kleenex, Therflu, Tylenol, etc.  Some of the supplies of these and other cold/flu medications were looking pretty sparse.  Some people are saying this could be a bad flu season on top of the covid issue so prepare now. Tonight is the Harvest Moon and in a couple days it will be the autumnal equinox.  It was so nice to walk today with temps at 79 instead of 109!  I love that fall is finally here!We are entering political season with people already announcing their candidacy for the 2022 elections (governor and congressional seats are up for grabs in our state).  Political ads are sure to follow...ick."},
{"title": "A Quick Update", "date": "Saturday, September 18, 2021", "text": "It's been pretty uneventful around here lately.  Las Vegas is more or less back to normal (including a full Raiders stadium and the huge Life is Beautiful Music Festival which is happening this weekend) but as usual we are staying low-key for now.  Among other things...They will be holding the World Series of Poker here next month.  I signed up to work but after thinking about it for a while--and hearing everyone won't need to wear masks during the event--I decided not to work this year.  Hubby is vaxxed, I am not, and while we both take precautions, I don't want to inadvertently pick up the virus and bring it home to him (vaxxed people are still being hospitalized and dying from covid and with his long list of health issues I'd rather forgo the extra money this year and hope things are better by next year!).I have made a huge bucket list of sorts and we have been knocking things off the list a little at a time (I blog about our activities here).Did you know that a company will pay someone $1300 to watch 3 scary movies in October?  You can apply here.Here's a huge list of free alternatives to paid software.The news is saying this should be the last week of triple digit temperatures for the year in Las Vegas.  Yeah!  We are looking forward to cooler weather!Supply chain issues are still showing up all over here.  There are several products that seem to have disappeared completely (certain kinds of fish food and hair gel, last week Costco had lots of bottled water but no Kirkland toilet paper, my favorite buckwheat pancake mix has been missing for ages, etc).  So a heads up to do your Christmas shopping ASAP since they are saying shortages may be even worse by Christmas.The cousins came to visit last week so of course we cooked a bunch of food for them as it saves them a lot of money over eating out (they all gathered here after a vacation to Mexico; we cooked and dropped off food where they are staying but didn't hang around and chat because of the risk of covid).Hopefully you are all doing well and staying healthy!"},
{"title": "A Nice Saturday Morning Walk", "date": "Saturday, September 4, 2021", "text": "Today our walking group did our first walk of the season along the north part of the Las Vegas Strip.  It was a nice seven mile walk with lots to see along the way.  Fortunately this walk goes in and out of casinos since it was in the high 90s today!"},
{"title": "Cinnamon Rolls", "date": "Sunday, August 22, 2021", "text": "I was bored today so I decided to make some cinnamon rolls.  I pulled up a random recipe online--it said these were the best cinnamon rolls--so I baked some up and can confirm these actually are the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made!  Usually they are dry and tough but these were really light and fluffy.  Yum!"},
{"title": "Wow It's Been a While", "date": "Friday, August 20, 2021", "text": "I guess time flies when not much is happening!  I didn't even realize it's been two weeks since I last posted here but not much has been going on lately...We are still getting interesting sunsets (mostly due to the massive amount of smoke heading our way from the California wildfires).I told you about getting new tires then getting a nail in one of the tires only a couple of days later.  Well, a couple days after we had our new windshield installed (it was hit by a rock when hubby was driving and made a clean break through half the windshield), we were driving down the freeway and it was hit by another rock leaving a small gash in the windshield.  Ugh  Fortunately the company that put the windshield in had a warranty and they were able to fix the ding for free so that was a nice outcome.Next Wednesday (August 25th) is a free entry day to the National Parks.Also, September 18 is free entry day to many museums for the Smithsonian's Museum Day.  You can get free tickets here.I ordered a new tablet more than a month ago and the delivery date is still getting pushed back.  It was supposed to arrive last week and now it is listed for arrival in mid-September!  This supply chain mess is awful!That's pretty much it for this week besides covid and more covid.  We just try to avoid people as much as possible and mask up when we are out and about! One side note, we picked up a friend from the airport and brought her to where she left her car when she went on vacation and when she got ready to leave, her car battery was dead.  We were able to easily jump her car with a little jumper battery we got a while back.  The jumper was so small we didn't even know if it would work but it worked flawlessly so it was definitely a good purchase and much easier than using jumper cables!"},
{"title": "A Bunch of Money Stuff", "date": "Thursday, August 5, 2021", "text": "It's been a busy, and financially trying, couple of weeks...Right before the kids and grandkids came to visit we looked at the tires on our car and decided they were looking a little old.  Although they were only five years old (as old as the car) that's kind of like eight years old in Vegas years because it is so dry and hot here that rubber and plastics age really fast.  So we got new tires for the car ($500, not a bad price) at Discount Tire (we love this tire shop as they do good service at reasonable rates and also put air in the tires and do tire rotations for free any time we ask!).When I drove everyone to the airport on their way out of town I noticed the car was pulling to the right a lot so I ran by the tire store and they diagnosed a nail in one of the tires :(  Fortunately they patched it for free but it's a bummer this happened to brand new tires!Then a few days later we went to take the car out of the garage and the garage door wouldn't open.  After a quick inspection we found that the garage door spring had broken in half.  So we got this fixed (after watching some YouTube videos to see if we could DIY it, the consensus was that messing with garage springs could kill you so we called a professional--$275).  The guy said it wasn't unusual for this to happen as--again, due to it being very hot and dry--garage springs don't last very long here either.  UghNext, a few days ago, hubby was driving on the freeway, a rock hit the windshield and left a small hole, which quickly turned into a very long crack.  It can't be repaired so we have a guy coming to change out the windshield next week for $275.We've done a couple shopping trips to Costco and Sam's Club and it seems like everything has increased in price!  And while it may only be 50 cents or a dollar increase on each product, that really adds up when you buy dozens of products which have all increased in price.  Add to this random trips to other stores where even basic items like hair gel are sold out and shopping has turned into a very frustrating activity!Our house has developed a bunch of tiny, niggling problems that are, while not emergencies, they are nonetheless annoying so I ran by Home Depot today and bought everything needed to fix these issues--a light switch with a short, a leaking kitchen faucet, caulking coming off sinks, toilet water valves that don't close all the way--and tomorrow hubby and I will have a field day of fixing things around the house.Finally, on a happy note, I got an advertisement from Costco that says they now offer insurance so I called and found that going with their home and car insurance plans would save us about $250 a year so we switched!  Needless to say, I am always on the lookout for ways to save extra money!"},
{"title": "40 Back to School Tips", "date": "Saturday, July 31, 2021", "text": "I was at Walmart today and forgot that school will start here on August 9th so needless to say, it was a madhouse with back to school shopping!  Here are a bunch of tips for back to school (even though its been a couple decades since we had kids to get ready for school I think many of these things still apply!)...If your kids qualify for free or reduced-price school meals, sign them up!  Our school district has decided to just provide free meals for all kids this year.If your kids will be taking their lunch, check out zero-waste options as well as ideas for cheap yet healthy lunches you can make them.Your first stop for back-to-school info should be your local school district's website (ours is a font of information for all things school-related).Google for free student resources (there are a million websites full of free stuff for kids).If your kids don't have a library card for your community's library, get them one.  Our library has so many great resources for kids and everyone else!Be sure to seek out student discounts (again, there are so many pages of these online).You can also sign your kids up for free National Park passes if they qualify.You can Google your local area for Back-To-School immunization clinics which provide free immunizations to kids which are required in many school districts.You can also Goggle for resources and news articles about free school supplies for kids in need.When it comes to school shopping you can start with free (ask for hand me downs from friends and relative's kids, hit up free clothing banks, etc).You can also go cheap on school clothes and still have totally presentable kids (shopping at the Goodwill and other thrift stores on discount days can give your kids A LOT of great clothes for very little money).Plan in advance how your kids will get to and from school.  Back when I was a kid it was walking or walking, these days most kids I know are driven to and from school by their parents (my parents would have keeled over laughing if I asked to be driven to school outside of a complete emergency situation!).  If they are walking or bicycling or taking a bus, have them practice how to do these things before school starts.If your kids will be taking public transit to school, most systems have discounted monthly passes for students which you can get prior to school starting.If your kids will have cell phones this school year check out cheap plans (I like Mint) and be sure to put your phone number ICE (in case of emergency) on their lock screen.Also set clear limits on the use of electronic devices by your kids (thank goodness this wasn't an issue when our kids were young!). Pretty obvious, but line up your before and after school child care options ASAP.  This ranges from a nanny or babysitter, to enlisting grandparents to help out, to school-sponsored before and after school care.  When the kids were young, hubby would put a little emergency bag in each of their school backpacks which included a granola bar, a $20 bill (with a stern warning it was for dire emergencies only!), a laminated list of our phone numbers as well as numbers of a neighbor, a few relatives, and a few friends, etc.Check on the school district's website and read their active shooter/winter storms/emergency plans then review these with the kids so they will know what is expected to happen during an emergency.  When the grandkids said they have active shooter drills I was pretty shocked and saddened that they would even have to worry about such a thing but prepared is better than being unprepared I guess.Start your kid's school sleep routine a week or so before school starts.  When the grandkids were here a couple weeks ago I wondered if they always stayed up until 2am but their dad said they would be back to their going-to-bed-at 8pm routine when they got back home so they would already have their routine down when school starts.For kids who are new to school--whether kindergartners or kids who have moved to a new school--most schools have open houses or days that they are open before school officially starts so kids can come in and check out their school/classroom, meet their teacher, etc.  This is a good thing to take advantage of so kids will feel more comfortable on the first day of school.Set up systems to keep your kids organized and on track.  A calendar/calendar app, a place at home to do homework, a place for school bags, a \"supply closet\" for when they need more school supplies, access to their school/class portal for checking grades/assignments/etc.Have a set daily schedule.  Have breakfast at the same time, leave for the bus at the same time, do homework at the same time, do chores at the same time, have parents check homework daily at the same time, etc.  This keeps everyone on track.When it comes to cell phones/tablets/laptops for students, check out free software for students and student discounts for hardware at many retailers.Also, consider using parental controls on your kids laptops/cell phones/tablets/social media accounts/etc.  I am so glad all of this was a non-issue when I, and the kids, were young--it sounds like a nightmare for parents to deal with!  Depending on how tech savvy your kid is, this may or may not be effective.  If possible, get your kids a dental exam/cleaning, vision check, hearing check, and school sports physical prior to going back to school.  It's always good to start school with all of these things done!Speaking of sports, determine ahead of time what sports and activities your kids will participate in and be proactive about having them ready before the season starts (ie: waivers signed, uniforms and equipment purchased, pre conditioning, etc).Speaking of fresh starts, completely clean your kid's rooms, maybe update their bedding, donate clothes and shoes they no longer fit/wear, get them new pajamas...making the start of school a fun annual event makes kids look forward to starting a new school year.Prior to school starting--really all summer if possible--have your kids read, write, and 'rithmatic if possible.  This will get them prepped for school so they won't start out the school year already behind (this is called the Summer Slide in school talk).For high school students who intend to go to college, check and see if they qualify for programs which offer high school and college classes simultaneously (this will save them A LOT of money as college tuition is usually free with these programs).Also for kids who intend to go to college, have them start applying for scholarships as soon as possible (the less college loans they need, the better!). For kids who re iffy about college, expose them to other career paths such as the military, apprenticeship programs, business ownership, and other college alternatives.By in bulk and buy ahead of time.  For example, buy a year's worth of school supplies in the summer when most stores have deep discounts on school supplies; give them half now and half after winter break.  Instead of two bags of socks, buy four and save two to give to your child after winter break.  Start looking now when you go to the Goodwill for homecoming and prom dresses (our Goodwill has AMAZING formal dresses for really cheap).Review the school rules, class rules, student code of conduct, etc. with your kids so they won't be surprised if they inadvertently break a rule.  Some schools are sticklers for dress codes, some programs will drop kids who break their ethics codes, etc.If possible, have your kids socialize with their classmates during the summer or prior to school starting so they will already have friends to hang out with/walk to school with when school starts.Familiarize yourself with social problems your kids are likely to encounter including bullying, suicidal ideation, etc.  While bullying has always been a thing, suicide in kids--even as young as 9 or 10--isn't uncommon these days.  Here's some tips.Parents should definitely use the school's portal for everything from making sure there is money in their student's lunch account to checking grades, communicating with teachers, checking the school's calendar regularly, etc.Plan regular fun activities for kids on the weekends.  Our library always has free kid's activities every weekend, we have low-cost swimming pools, free community events, and other fun yet inexpensive things for families to do.  This breaks up the tedium of school for everyone!Also on weekends, consider teaching your kids useful life skills (I heard schools don't even have shop class or home ec classes anymore!).Try to have your kids participate in at least one after school sport or activity (busy kids don't have time to get in trouble usually!).Teach your kids by your actions how to help others. Donate school supplies, volunteer at your child's school, show up for your kids school activities, etc.Hopefully kids and their schools can \"get back to normal\" after last school year!"},

{"title": "10 Things from Today", "date": "Wednesday, July 7, 2021", "text": "In no particular order... For some reason there was a ton of Christmas stuff on display at the Goodwill today including this big guy in the picture (on sale for $150!).  Christmas in July maybe?After an interminable wait for PUA unemployment several months ago, I got a letter from the unemployment office a couple days ago saying they paid me too much and I needed to return $1300.  I checked the weeks they said I was disqualified for and thanks to the Wayback Machine I was able to find a schedule for my job for 2020 so I filed an appeal with a letter explaining the weeks I would have worked had the job not been cancelled so hopefully that takes care of this problem.I never buy ink for my printer and instead make the few copies of documents that I need at our local Office Depot.  Unfortunately our local Office Depot recently closed down so I thought I would go across the street and make copies of the appeal letter at the UPS Store but they charge $1.50 per page!  So we went to a nearby library to make copies and they only charged 10 cents per page there!  Instead of paying $6 for copies of four pages we only paid 40 cents so that was a big savings today.Next it was off to the post office to mail my appeal letter via registered mail to ensure the unemployment office gets the letter prior to the appeal expiration deadline.  I haven't used the post office in a while so I was surprised it cost a little over $4 to mail the letter!  I guess prices are rising on everything!It's 114 degrees today and the weather website says it will stay over 110 degrees for the next week...eeekkk.When we were at the library, we noticed that they have a DJ Booth for teens to use to learn how to be a DJ.  Since it is so hot here and since the grandkids will be here next week, we have been trying to plan some inside activities for us all to do together so it looks like the DJ Booth will definitely be on our list of activities since all of the grandkids are into music.  I love our library system!I watched the free concerts that took place downtown last weekend on YouTube and judging by all of the people who packed into the area, I am more than happy to check out everything online rather than in person.  Videos here, here, and here.I've heard people saying gas might go up to $10 per gallon(!).  Hopefully it doesn't get that high but it is already near $6 a gallon in California.  Double eeekkk.I've been watching YouTube movies recently; they are free to watch with commercials.  My favorites so far: Jane Eyre (the 1997 version which I had never seen before) and Holy Chicken (I'm a big fan of Morgan Spurlock).Finally, the price of houses in our area--all over actually--continues to skyrocket.  It would be great to sell our house and pay cash for a cheaper house somewhere else with all of the equity we have in our current house but with prices high everywhere that we would be interested in moving to, the savings wouldn't be that great."},

{"title": "Preparing for Guests", "date": "Friday, July 2, 2021", "text": "We are planning to have several guests during the course of this month so one of the things we do to get ready for this is to shop loss leaders in order to have lots of food on hand without spending a lot of money.  We usually cook everyday when people are here and depending on what activities everyone wants to do, we will even pack them lunches to take with them.  This was our haul for today:2 small watermelons, 2 ears of corn, 4 tomatoes, 4-12 packs of soda, 3 cans baked beans, 1 mayonnaise, a half pound of London Broil from the deli, 4 boxes of brownie mix, 2 pounds of bacon, 3-half pound packages of cheese, 3 packages of pork ribs, a gallon of almond milk, and a half dozen sandwich rolls.  The total price of these groceries would have been $132.10 but by buying loss leaders, sale items, and using the store's app, we only paid $54.89 for a savings of $77.21!We have lots of food stored up in the freezer and in the pantry so this will just add to the stockpile and make it super easy to pull together a meal quickly and inexpensively (needless to say, taking a dozen people out to dinner every night would cost a fortune so this is one of the biggest ways we save money when we host visitors!)."},
{"title": "Several Rants for This Week", "date": "Thursday, July 1, 2021", "text": "A short round-up of rants from this week...The fish food Ialways buy has went from $1.99 (a price it has been forever) to $7.99 over thecourse of a couple months.  Why???I was waiting forUPS to deliver a package and it arrived at 9:15pm (!) the driver was on hour 14of his shift.  That is not safe for thedriver or anyone on the road with him.I was at Ross this morning and there were two cashiers and more than 30 people inline.  The line went all the way to theback of the store!  Crappy staffing orlack of workers?Staffing atrestaurants has been pretty sparse too. Either restaurants are staffing at half their usual level on purpose orthey can't find staff.I can't find ammoat any of the regular stores I go to (Walmart, Bass Pro, etc) and it has beenthis way for more than a year.  I haven't been shooting in ages but I don't want to deplete my supply of ammo without being able to replace it.  It seems like shortages is a new way of life these days.It's hot AFoutside.  Not much to be done about itand we live in a place that is hot most of the year but we have lots of friendsand relatives in normally cool areas who have never seen 100+ temps and theyare miserable.  I only have one friend in Washington State who purposely added central air when she built her house; usually central air is uncommon there because in the past it never really got too hot for too long there.  Is this something else that will become a new normal?We were tossingaround the idea of buying a new van.  We have alot of guests (three separate families are coming to visit just this month) so Ichecked the dealership that we usually go to and they had a total inventory of 4(!) new vans with an average price of $42k. Literally five years ago this same new model of van was $25k.  That's insane! One of thegrandkids is deciding on which university to attend and he called to ask aboutmy alma mater.  When I looked up theannual cost for this school (which I hadn't done in decades) it was $70k.WTAF???  $280k for an undergraddegree???? That's insane too!  How on earth can they expect a CHILD to saddle themselves with that sort of debt for a four year degree??? I told him to become a plumber or electrician.Food prices in general seem to be skyrocketing.  We always shop sales and loss leaders and shop at ethnic stores which have good prices on produce so we don't seem to be spending a lot more on our groceries but in general prices seem really high especially for meat.Then there was this article about hotshot firefighters making only $13.45 an hour.  Hmmm...flipping burgers for $15 an hour or risking life and limb for $13.45...  what a choice!Maybe I am just getting old and cranky but there seems to be a sea change happening when it comes to the everyday things we used to take for granted like getting good service when we shop or go out to eat, paying reasonable prices for the stuff we buy, and just basic social things like treating employees reasonably well."},

{"title": "From This Week...", "date": "Thursday, June 17, 2021", "text": "...we have had more beautiful sunsets (there have been a few fires in the area which causes a lot of particulate matter in the air which is what makes for such dramatic sunsets).  ...it's still hot!  ...our neighbor got a solar system installed.  We kind of checked into this when we first moved in but it seemed like we wouldn't realize a return on such an investment for years so decided not to go with solar on our house.  ...our lemon tree is bursting with baby lemons!  ...I'm making some progress on my jigsaw puzzle.   ...I applied to work at the World Series of Poker for the 8th (?) year.  They moved the date of the event from summer--it is usually happening this month--to late fall so I'm not sure what we will be doing then as we had some travel planned but my friend called and said just to apply then decide if I want to work later.  I love working at this event so I am happy they are back after skipping last year due to the pandemic and with travel still being kind of \"iffy\", this may be a great way to spend our fall and make a little extra money!...another friend is bound and determined to find me a job (not sure why, I am happily kind of retired!) so when she heard a similar job to the one I applied for a couple months ago just came open, she immediately called me and said to apply as she thinks that organization doesn't need their director to live in the area.  I'll send in my CV and see what happens!...We were talking to a friend of ours who is 90 (!) years old.  She is quite independent, drives herself everywhere, is an avid bowler, and is hilariously funny.   When we were visiting her I noticed she had a big stack of books on the table which she said she had finished reading.  Apparently she buys A LOT of books so I told her about how great our library system is and that she can download any book she wants to read for free from the library.  She had never heard of this so she said she would have her daughter get her set up for this on her tablet.  When I was showing her all of the online resources from our library, even I was surprised at how much their resource section had expanded.  This is an example of the kinds of things our library has available and I've heard that other libraries let people check out free passes for tourist attractions in their area.  Amazing!"},

My jigsaw puzzle is coming along...slowly.  I don't think I will be getting the job I applied for a while back.  They asked twice if I would consider relocating back to Washington State, my answer both times was no.  Even the though of going back to a place the is grey and rainy for several months of the year makes me shudder!  I love waking up to bright sunshine everyday!Here is a long list of great, free resources on the internet.I've been thinking a lot about what my life will look like when I am old.  I came across this interesting article although I can't picture myself living with other people in the same house (I did a bit of this in college and that was enough to last a lifetime!).  And while vanlife looks good in the media, I don't think living in a car would be very comfortable either.  Did you know that there are nudist communities for seniors?  I didn't until this video showed up in my YouTube suggestions.  Eeekkk.  Maybe I will set up my own tiny home community!  Finally, it is still hot here.  We've broke several records in the past week so this looks like it will be a long, hot summer!"},

{"title": "The Emergency Bag", "date": "Thursday, May 27, 2021", "text": "We always carry an emergency \"bug out bag\" in our car.  Ever since hubby had several health problems in a row that usually ended with him staying in the hospital for days at a time, I decided to put together a bag of emergency supplies so that if we had an emergency and needed to leave our home for any period of time, we would have all of the basics to sustain us right in our car.  I usually take this bag out every few months, review the contents, add or subtract stuff in the bag as needed, and make sure things like batteries still work, the battery bank is charged, the food is rotated, etc.  With hurricane and wildfire season coming up, I thought this was a good time to make a post about what we always have with us.  Our emergency bag includes:A bag.  I use a backpack as it is easier to carry than, say, a duffel bag, in case I need to bring the bag into a hotel room/hospital room/need to leave the car behind/etc.A complete change of clothes plus jackets and underwear for both hubby and I.Four face masks and two sets of nitrile gloves (this was added since covid but the masks are also good for wildfire smoke too).Two Mylar emergency blankets, two disposable plastic rain jackets, and some paracordA spork and a micro fiber towel from REIThe black flowery bag has tampons and a complete set of makeup for me (lipstick, eyeliner, brow liner, concealer, powder, eye shadow)The small grey bag is a first aid kit (band aids, Thera flu, alcohol wipes, Tylenol packets, safety pins, lip balm, two condoms--not for their original use but to be used to carry water in an emergency, as a tourniquet, etc, spare batteries for hubby's hearing aids, Fix a Dent for hubby, glucose tabs for hubby, a few cough drops, an two day's worth of medications for hubby)In the pink striped bag is a toiletries kit (comb, razor, nail clippers, nail file, tweezers, bobby pins, tooth brush, toothpaste, floss, shampoo, conditioner, suntan lotion, soap, mirror, hand lotion, deodorant)A 20,000mAh battery bank An AM/FM transistor radio and ear budsA second spare pair of corded earbuds (both of our cell phones still have a port for corded earbuds so we use these in an emergency as they don't need to be charged like our wireless earbuds)A headlampA mini Maglight flashlightSpare AAA batteries (for the radio, headlamp, and Maglight)A charging cable with type A and C tips (to charge our cell phones, tablets, wireless ear buds, etc)USB to type A and type C cables (ditto, so we can charge multiple items at the same time) A thumb drive with all of our backed up files on itA small Gerber knifeA Sharpie penA Fisher Space penA combo emergency whistle, magnifying glass, compass, and thermometerTwo packs of Kleenex tissueA ziploc bag with matches, sticky notes, rubber bands, mini can opener, and a mini Super GlueBasic food (granola bars, candies, mini packs of raisins, mini packs, of nuts, etc)We carry the following items every time we leave the house:Cell phonesWallets with ID, credit cards, and cashMy purse: packet of tissue, keys, sun glasses, face mask and a mini emergency kit that I always carry in my purse (band aids, Wet Wipe, Tylenol packet, spare hearing aid batteries and spare medication for hubby, tampon, lipstick, pocket knife, Fisher Space pen, thumb drive with my files backed up on it, mini Maglight, alcohol wipe, matches, nail file)Insulated Contigo beverage containers along with lunch or snacks In the car we always have:Mini umbrellaSpare jacketsA case of bottled waterA complete car emergency kit Also: We would be wearing a full set of clothes and shoes We would grab our tablets and laptops on the way out"},

{"title": "20 Ways We Save Money on Food", "date": "Tuesday, April 6, 2021", "text": "Our local and national news programs have had several recent stories about the skyrocketing price of food and it doesn't look like costs will come down any time soon.   Here are 20 ways we save money on food in our neck of the woods...We shop at several stores every week or two to get the best prices.  The 99 Cent Store has great prices on produce and some dry goods (although some of their products are $1 but have been greatly shrunk over the size of the same product at a grocery store so it pays to pay attention to these things).  Asian and Mexican stores have great deals on meat and produce, our military base commissary can have steep discounts on some items, and Costco/Sam's Club are great for buying food in bulk (like rice, canned goods, giant boxes of oatmeal, etc).I shop ads and usually only buy loss leaders and sale items (when the cashier rings up our groceries even she will say \"wow\" when the grand total comes out to be less than half of the regular price!). I use a store app for a local grocery store and save lots on their app-only deals (one week it might be a loaf of bread for 20 cents or a big bottle of laundry soap for $1 along with many other discounted items each week).We always compare prices when shopping.  Sometimes there are bulk packages of items that actually cost more than smaller packages of the same items so hubby always uses the calculator on his phone to determine which is the cheapest per ounce.Also when shopping hubby tallies up the cost of each item as we go through the store so he knows exactly how much we should be paying at checkout.  I've lost count of how many times our groceries didn't add up correctly when we were checking out; sale prices don't register, the app stops working, discount prices aren't loaded into the store's computer...if the cashier doesn't ask for the amount hubby has on his calculator we figure out why and this always saves us money.We cook most of our meals at home and from scratch.  It's so much cheaper and healthier than eating out at restaurants everyday or buying pre-prepared/highly processed food.We bring food with us whenever we go out for the day.  Hubby makes and brings coffee with him, we whip up sandwiches or wraps for lunch, and for breakfast, if we have to be out early, we will usually bring homemade granola or breakfast sandwiches with us.  If we do eat out, it is almost always free (except for the tip).  Hubby gets lots of comps for playing poker so meals in casinos are free and friends and family usually give us restaurant gift cards for birthdays and other occasions so eating out is usually a (free or very cheap) treat.Our tricks for saving money when eating out include ordering tap water to drink, splitting meals (hubby and I always split meals and usually still have leftovers to take home), never ordering appetizers or desserts (the entrée is probably already more than 1000 calories, tacking on a soda, soup/salad, appetizer and dessert can shoot the calorie load over 5000 which no one needs to eat in one sitting!).I've broken my bad habit of hitting up the local Starbucks every day.  I got into this habit back when I was working and my coworkers and I would stop by Starbucks almost everyday that we had meetings.  Needless to say, this is an expensive--and unhealthy!--habit.Occasionally I will use coupons to buy food and household items but I don't do this very often as the coupons are usually for highly processed foods (like Pop Tarts and Hot Pockets...stuff we don't eat).  If they had coupons for flour, sugar, or other staples I would definitely use them!We don't buy in bulk very much anymore because there are no more kids in the house.  Other than a few staples, like rice and oatmeal which we eat quickly, buying huge quantities usually means some will go bad before we get to eat it.We shop the discount racks at the grocery store.  The day old bakery rack often has a half dozen croissants or a dozen rolls for $1 which is a great deal and they are still pretty fresh.  The close-to-expiration meat bin can often have great deals as well and our grocery stores usually cut the price on seasonal items the week after major holidays (we have bought several hams and turkeys at deep discounts this way).We cook in large quantities when we have guests and provide almost all meals at home for them.  Taking guests out to eat would bankrupt us--both because we get a lot of guests and because the restaurants here can be expensive--so we always cook for our guests when they visit.In general, we cook in family-sized quantities then freeze the leftovers in individual portions.  This is a great way to have instant meals on nights we don't feel like cooking.  In fact, we've kept one of the cousins fed through the entire pandemic this way--each week we take seven servings of frozen meals and deliver them to her!We try to eat mostly vegetarian/vegan meals as much as possible.  Besides the health benefits, a pound of meat shrinks down to maybe 3/4 pound after cooking while a pound of beans grows exponentially after cooking.When we do buy meat, hubby freezes it in individual portions so we only unfreeze a small amount of meat at a time.  One steak can provide four or five meals for us!Each week I clean out our refrigerator, freezer, and pantry and rotate food to make sure nothing expires before we can use it up.  Any little bits of leftovers get turned into things like smoothies (berries, a little spinach, a banana), fried rice (bits of leftover meat and vegetables), soups, etc.We like free food!  We each signed up for a bunch of restaurant birthday freebies, local restaurants sometimes have freebies (I recently got a free Starbucks drink at our local grocery store with an app coupon, Krispy Cream gave hubby a free donut when he showed is covid vaccine card), and friends invite us to parties where there is always food, etc.Stuff we don't do but would consider if needed: dumpster diving (many people love to do this), hitting up food pantries or meal programs, shopping discount places like Aldis (we don't have one of these stores in our area unfortunately) or WinCo (we haven't been to this store yet, it is a discounter that takes cash only no credit or debit cards), working at a restaurant in order to get a free meal (I did this all through college and rarely had to buy food this way), gardening (unfortunately we don't have enough yard to do this), etc."},

YouTuber from Thailand doing her livestream from the store and showing off different Kipling bags.  Seriously, it is never boring in Las Vegas!While our guests were here they wanted to look at new houses as they are thinking about moving here so we went along to look with them.  The houses we went to look at in a new subdivision by our house were $700k to $800k (!) for what seemed to be pretty basic houses (3500 to 4000 sq ft).  That is a crazy price for a house (IMHO)!  I hope you all have a wonderful holiday weekend!"},

{"title": "Frugal Friday and Other Stuff", "date": "Friday, March 12, 2021", "text": "This was a good frugal Friday, mostly because our local grocery store had some great sales and, along with some good deals on their app, we were able to get everything in the picture above for only $41.38.  Our haul included: a whole roast chicken, a dozen dinner rolls, green grapes, two pounds of strawberries, mayonnaise, two boxes of hair color, a pound of butter, two oranges, five pounds of potatoes, two pounds of apples, a half pound of sliced London broil from the deli, two packages of cheese, a pound of tomatoes, and a drink from Starbucks (they have a Starbucks in the store and the app had a 'get $5 off any Starbucks drink purchase' which made the drink free!).  Overall I think we got a great deal on all of these items!  Among other things...Don't forget to turn your clocks forward (in most of the US) this Saturday before you go to bed (daylight savings time starts on Sunday, March 14).Also this weekend, check your bank account--the new stimulus checks will start being deposited this weekend.Looking for an interesting job?  The Planter's NutMobile is looking for drivers!I love picking up stuff other people are throwing away.  Here is a wonderful article on cool things people have picked up that other people were throwing away.Here's the annual ranking of best states.  The state we left is #1, the state we moved to is #37!?!  But they couldn't pay us enough to move back to any place with a cold climate!Speaking of cold weather, it snowed in Las Vegas today!  Although we just got a lot of rain, our friends who live at higher elevations got snow.Here is an interesting article on 'The Joy of F@#% You Money'.  It's a good idea to have this sort of money in savings.Finally, I was looking at the first few posts I made on this blog more than a decade ago.  What a difference a decade makes!!!  Everything in our lives have changed since then, and all for the better!  We now live in a new place, we no longer are in debt, we are no longer working, What a trip down memory lane!"},
{"title": "Things I've Done to Save Money", "date": "Sunday, February 28, 2021", "text": "I was reading Kim's blog and saw this interesting post on things she did to save money.  She's done some pretty interesting things!  While I am not nearly as creative as she is, here are some things we have done/do to save money...Leave the car at home and walk/take the bus to do errands and save money/gas.Slept in the airport over night when we volunteered to get bumped in order to get a free ticket to use at a later date.Took up a collection for a relative's teeth (she needed a full set of dentures and while we have a dentist in the family to do the work for free, we took up a collection from family members to pay for materials and the denture maker's services).Coordinated a trade when an employee's mother needed teeth (we traded his carpet installation work with a dentist and a denturist to get free dentures for his mother).We've rarely had cable TV unless the package price was cheaper than regular internet price; we use an OTA antenna instead.We cut paper towels in quarter-sized sheets; it makes the right size for most uses and saves wasting an entire paper towel.We cook a lot of meals at home but when we do eat out, our average price at a restaurant is about $5 each at most (we use coupons and split meals).I research discounts for nearly every purchase--senior discounts, locals discounts, military discounts, etc.We watch YouTube videos and try to fix things ourselves before calling in a professional (most of the time we can easily fix things with just a video though).We rarely spend money on gifts for parties and events, instead we volunteer to help out with the event by baking desserts or cooking for the event.One of my first jobs was teaching gymnastics in exchange for free dance lessons.We've taken several off-off-season cruises (one went all over the south Pacific for two weeks and cost $250 each!).I've tried hanging the laundry outside to dry instead of using the dryer but it comes our crunchy so this was a short-lived experiment.I've worked several temp jobs just for the experience and a bit of spending money (my favorite was World Series of Poker, least favorite was Dollar Tree).I often have hubby cut my hair and I do my own coloring.  Hubby let me cut his hair once.  Did I mention I have no artistic talent at all?We buy all of our clothes (except socks, shoes, and underwear) from the Goodwill.We've stayed married for 35 years (a great way to save money; divorce is expensive!).I unplug appliances that aren't being used (like the TVs and lamps in the guest rooms, a printer that we rarely use, etc).We've picked up several things from the sidewalk on trash day and either used them or resold them.I've chosen jobs that come with fringe benefits (like working at a pizza place during college and eating free every day that I worked!).I try to use up as much old produce as possible--turning old apples into applesauce or apple pie, making stew or curries out of older vegetables, and making banana bread from old bananas.When we host guests (which we do a lot because we live in a tourist destination) we almost always cook at home for them.  Taking people out to dinner is expensive; for the same price we can make several meals for everyone!We don't use wipes and Swiffer pads and other disposable items, bleach water and a rag works just as well!I'm sure there are other odd things we do to save money which have become normalized for us but those are all I can think of at the moment!"},

{"title": "This Was Our Day", "date": "Saturday, February 6, 2021", "text": "This happened on Thursday...It was hubby's 72nd birthday!  We didn't have any definitive plan for the day so decided to just go with the flow.On the way to the breakfast place there was a crash in the lane right next to ours!  We were watching the car slightly in front of us in the next lane and like slow motion, another car just rammed into the back of that car.  Thankfully it wasn't a high-speed crash but yikes.We then went to Denny's where hubby got a free breakfast for his birthday.  Service was fast and good, the breakfast was a treat (we almost never go out for breakfast), and the manager comped the entire ticket (basically the coffee as we shared the one breakfast and still had leftovers) instead of just comping the breakfast.  Nice!Leaving the restaurant, we came inches from being t-boned by a big truck.  Double yikes.We decided to head to the casino so hubby could play poker for a few hours and on the way to downtown, a kid rode his bike, against the light, across six lanes of fast moving traffic.  It was fortunate the Mustang that was flying down the rode next to us was able to slam on his brakes and avoided hitting the kid (I'm pretty sure the kid used up one of his lives on that event).  By this time I was about finished being in the car for the day!Hubby played poker and came out even, not ahead.  Bummer.We had a nice (free via casino comps) dinner at Saltgrass Steakhouse.  Again, we split one dinner and still always have leftovers.  Service was good and fast again (it's such a rarity to get really good service these days, it's notable when it happens!).We went home and an hour later the girl that came to check the neighbor's house when they went on vacation came over and said someone had broke into their house!  We went over with her, saw the smashed sliding glass door, and we went around with her to make sure no one was in the house.  She had to leave so she gave me the key to the house and we waited for the police to come (a fast response which was surprising as these are very common, very low-priority calls).  Amusingly enough, both cops went in with their guns drawn even though I told them me and the girl already made sure no one was inside...policy I guess.  So I took pictures and sent them to the homeowner, the girl came back and we cleaned up all the glass (who knew one glass door had so much glass in it--it was everywhere!), and her husband boarded up the door.  The homeowners came back in record time from California..and this is how I met our neighbors.Finally, a bit after midnight the doorbell rang and we opened it thinking the neighbor needed something and it was hubby's daughter who had flown across the country to surprise her dad for his birthday.  While I appreciate the sentiment, it is during a global pandemic!!!  Ayayay.  So we are having a nice time while she is here for a few days and hoping hubby doesn't catch anything (he had his first covid shot but not the second yet).Anyway, it was an interesting birthday for hubby as our lives are never this exciting!"},

{"title": "The Bill Review", "date": "Sunday, January 3, 2021", "text": "Every year, usually around January, I take a look at our list of monthly/quarterly/annual bills and see if there are any I can reduce or get rid of all together.  Here's this year's review: Mortgage.  We have debated refinancing our mortgage for a lower interest rate but we are paying it off pretty quickly so we probably won't do this to avoid paying closing costs on a loan we hope to pay off sooner rather than later.  Included in our mortgage payment is home insurance (I call around annually to see if other companies can give us a lower rate and have switched companies a couple times over the years for a better rate).  Also included in the mortgage is property tax which we reduce with hubby's veteran's tax exemption from the county.Electricity.  We try to conserve energy as best we can; overall our energy rates are lower here than in our previous home in Seattle.Natural gas.  Ditto.Sewer.  We pay this bill annually and get a discount of about $20 over paying the bill quarterly.  This is a flat rate and there is no way to reduce this bill.Garbage.  We pay this bill quarterly.  I saw a neighbor with a much smaller garbage can than we have so I am going to call the garbage company tomorrow and see if they have a cheaper rate than for their usual huge garbage can.HOA.  I hate HOAs but there isn't much we can do about this as most homes in Las Vegas are part of an HOA.  We pay our HOA fees annually just to avoid having to pay them every month.Water.  We try to conserve water in order to keep this bill as low as possible.  Again, the cost for water is much cheaper here in the desert than in rainy Seattle which I totally don't understand.Internet.  We don't have a cable TV bill as we use an over-the-air antenna for free TV but we need internet so we pay about $50 a month for a middling internet service and any time the cost goes up I call and grovel and get a cheaper rate.Car insurance.  The price for car insurance in Las Vegas is ridiculously high so I call around annually to see if we can get a better rate through another company.  We have an OK rate now so are happy with it plus we pay the bill biannually in order to get a small discount over paying monthly.Health insurance.  We get this through the military and definitely can't argue about the price (about $25 per month for me, hubby has Medicare so the fee comes out of his Social Security).Cell phone.  We have Mint for our cell service and at $180 each ANNUALLY for cell service, we feel we are getting an excellent deal.Car registration.  We pay this annually and get a steep discount with hubby's veteran's tax exemption through the county.Grandson's school.  We pay for private school for one of the grandsons and thank goodness he is a senior this year so this bill will be ending soon.Domain name registration.  I still have a half dozen domain names even though I do very little web development these days.  I buy these domain names annual through Name Cheap and the cost is very reasonable.Tithe.  I tithe to Unity on a monthly basis since I don't have a local church and have been doing this for years.Netflix.  This is our only streaming service and until there is something equally as good but cheaper we will keep this service which hubby uses on a regular basis.Visa.  We put all of our shopping on one credit card and pay it off monthly.  With all shopping--food, clothes, tech, gifts, etc--we try to buy on sale, in bulk, with a discount or coupons, etc in order to keep costs low.Savings.  We put a set amount into savings each month which has varied from little when we were paying off bills to about half our income now since we have no more bills to pay off.  We may shift some of this money to pay off the house faster but with the current financial situation, we like to keep a good amount in savings not so much for us but to use if one of the five kids or 13 grandkids needs help.That's it for all of our bills.  In general we live pretty frugally and try to keep our bills as few and as low as possible!"},

The cakes in the picture above are just the beginning.  Next up brownies followed by sugar cookies and maybe chocolate chip cookies after that.  We have several people to make trays of goodies for and then we will deliver them tomorrow morning.  That is the extent of our holiday activities for this year--no annual holiday fish fry, no Christmas eve party with 50+ people, no Christmas day bowling tournament which we have been doing for nearly a decade...a very low key Christmas indeed.  Hopefully by next Christmas all will be back to normal!"},

{"title": "This Weekend...I'm Not Shopping", "date": "Monday, November 30, 2020", "text": "It seems I may be the only person not shopping this weekend based on social media and news reports of everyone going nuts with their shopping on Black Friday and Cyber Monday but there is literally nothing I need!About a week before Thanksgiving, sale ads started inundating my email box, blasting through social media, and popping up on every website I visited.  It seems like right after Thanksgiving, these ads increased ten-fold.  By that point I was fed up with the entire idea of shopping.The reasons I don't feel like shopping this year include...I have everything I need.  Clothes, check.  Cell phone, tablet, laptop...check, check, check.  Shoes and walking/hiking gear...check, check.I feel better about my phone.  I always like to have the latest and greatest cell phone but at $1000+ for a new Samsung Galaxy phone, the price is getting pretty ridiculous.  Especially since I really don't use my cell phone for much more than texting and calling a few people as well as taking pictures.  Besides, one of the top tech guys was asked what his favorite Android phone is and he said that the three-generation-old Galaxy S8 is his favorite which is the phone I have!I want a specific tablet which isn't available.  I have a great tablet (a 10\" Galaxy Tab S6...a tablet many people think is better than the newer S 7s) but what I really want is an 8\" Android tablet with great specs.  Currently my only options for an 8\" tablet are an Apple iPad Mini (I don't like Apple products) or a Huawei M6 8\" (due to the government ban, Google play and US apps won't work on this tablet) so I don't want to settle on a tablet that is \"just OK\" which means no tablet buying until they come out with something I really really want.We are generally low-tech people.  Aside from the usual cell phones/tablets/laptops, we are pretty much low-tech.  No Roomba (I actually like vacuuming), no smart assistant like Siri or Alexa devices, our TVs are around ten years old and are still working fine, and hubby keeps asking if I want a Kitchen Aid mixer because I bake a lot but I prefer to use my hands.Good enough is good enough.  There will always be something better out there but most often, something that is good enough is better than continually buying the latest and greatest.  Take ear buds for example.  I have a pair of generic earbuds that cost around $25 and work just fine for the infrequent times I use them.  There are a lot of good ear buds on sale now--the Galaxy buds Live, Galaxy buds Plus, and Galaxy buds Pro--which are on sale for $100+ but based on how often I use them (hardly ever), how I use them (listening to YouTube videos, not listening to or editing music tracks), and how much I care about what other people think about the name brands I use (not at all), there is really no need to upgrade to a \"better\" pair of earbuds.  Then there are the WTF were they thinking earbuds that cost $2799(!?!) that I guess are for the wealthy who have run out of things to spend their money on.  Buying what meets your own unique needs is better than being swayed by the media to continually buy more and better (read more expensive) things.Hubby is the voice of reason.  It's our 30th anniversary today so for 34 years (the length of time we have been together...we met the weekend before Thanksgiving in 1986 and moved in together the weekend after Thanksgiving in 1986!), hubby has been the voice of reason and knows me too well.  First I will see something I like, then I will research it to death, then I will decide I really need the item, then I will tell hubby I really need said item, then hubby will say \"but you already have similar item\", then hubby will say \"go get it if you really need it but you know we could put the money to better use...\".  Then I will stew about it and decide that spending money wisely is probably better than spending it on something I will be bored with in a few months.  Occasionally I will decide that I definitely need to buy something (like the $800 I spent on a Dell XPS laptop which was more than I had ever spent on a laptop before but I am happy to report it lasted me for four years then I passed it on to a relative who is still using it eight years after I purchased it!), but more often than not, after much thought, I decide not to buy every item that snags my attention...which is a good thing in the grand scheme of things.I am surely and steadily moving towards a more simple living/minimalistic/anti-consumption/buy-it-for-life/zero-waste lifestyle.  This means less shopping, less wastefulness, and buying one good product (hopefully with multiple uses) and using it for a long time instead of buying several of the same or similar products that just take up space, waste money, and aren't used often.This is just my take on cutting back on consumerism in general.  For some people, shopping is their happiness and if they can afford it, they should make themselves happy.  For many people, however, their shopping woes can be summed up in 'The Overspent American', 'Affluenza', and 'Your Money or Your Life'."},

{"title": "10 Things for the Upcoming Week", "date": "Wednesday, October 28, 2020", "text": "It's kind of a busy week around here...First of all, vote.  I voted by mail which was really easy to do, however we drove by a couple early voting locations today and there were long lines at both places.  Our early voting ends on Friday then voters can go on the usual voting day (next Tuesday) for their final opportunity to vote in person.  This Saturday is Halloween.  We have no plans at all for the holiday and we won't be handing out candy either (neither of us wants to greet dozens of germy kids!).  Usually friends host Halloween parties as well but of course that isn't happening either...it's kind of like we all got an entire year off from social obligations!Also this Saturday, before we go to bed, we will turn our clocks back an hour as Daylight Savings Time ends on Sunday.Speaking of Sunday, November 1st is the official start of NaNoWriMo.  This stands for National Novel Writing Month during which participants are challenged to write an entire novel during the month of November.  With nothing else planned for the month I may actually give this a shot!Then there is the ever-present covid.  Our state, like many other states, is again trending up in covid cases.  Fortunately the hubby, I, and our recent guests are all still healthy so we dodged a bullet there.  We have again cut back on leaving our house except for hubby's bowling (he throws his ball then moves a dozen feet away from the other players and of course wears a mask, also no more high fiving the teammates when someone does well).  It looks like isolation, masks, and copious amounts of hand sanitizer are the new normal for the foreseeable future.We are getting ready for winter.  Our temps dropped from the high 80s to low 50s in one day!  Now it looks like these up and down temperatures are here to stay so it was a good reminder to change out the furnace filters, make sure our outside faucets are covered, and to break out our winter clothing.It's always a good idea to be ready to evacuate due to a disaster.  We have been kind of lax about preparing for any sort of disaster because we don't really have natural disasters in Las Vegas but I need to be more proactive about this.  When I heard people in Irvine were evacuating due to a wildfire I was pretty surprised since that is a more urban area that isn't usually in the path of wildfires.  Lesson: everyone needs to be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice.Another thing on our radar is the possibility of post-election rioting and protesting after Tuesday's election.  No matter who wins. many cities are gearing up for unrest which is kind of scary.  I've seen this type of behavior in other countries around elections but never in the US.  Needless to say, we may just stay home for the entire week next week.Did you know that November is also known as No-Spend November for many people?  This is a great way to cut spending and increase savings before the Christmas holiday.  Hubby was looking at our bank accounts today and pointed out that we are spending about $500 less per month over the past several months due to not eating out, not shopping unless we really really need something, very little online shopping, not traveling, and not going out and about doing other activities that we used to do.  I guess if there is a bright spot to this year's situation, it is that we learned how much money we wasted with mindless spending; a little here and a little there...it all adds up!Finally, we feel pretty prepared if there happens to be another lockdown.  Shutting the state down again is just rumor now but whether it happens or not, we are way more prepared than we were back in March.  Our food stock is up, we have plenty of bleach and masks, we have lots of bottled water stocked as well as lots of toilet paper.  Hopefully there won't be another lockdown but if there is, we are ready and getting more ready by the week!"},
{"title": "10 Frugal Things This Weekend", "date": "Saturday, October 24, 2020", "text": "Continuing on with our frugal ways...We went to the Goodwill today and I got a screaming hot deal on an Arc'teryx fluorescent green windbreaker which will be great for walking this fall.  It is similar to this jacket but instead of paying hundreds of dollars for it, I got it for $4 (it was $5 but there was a 20% discount).  Wow!The toilet in hubby's bathroom had a slow leak.  We determined it was leaking from the gasket between the bowl and the tank so I ordered the gasket from Amazon for $6 and we fixed it within a half hour.Also, while I was shampooing the carpet, I noticed the brushes weren't rotating.  We took the shampooer apart and determined the belt had broken so again, I hopped on Amazon and ordered two new belts for $7, they were delivered the next day, and it took all of ten minutes to fix it and get back to shampooing the carpet!  FWIW there are YouTube videos on how to replace the belt and every other thing you could ever need to fix.Finally the temperature in Las Vegas has dropped to a more reasonable 80ish degrees so we have officially (I hope) shut off the AC for the season.  We are hoping to go at least a month without needing either heat or air conditioning which will save a good deal of money.Also, on a happy utility note, we got our electric bill this month and found the bill was zero plus we have a $30 credit for next month.  Apparently our electric company was ordered to return money to consumers for some reason so we ended up with a nearly $200 credit!  Yippee!When hubby got his VA disability rating, we noticed that he was listed as single even though we have been married for over 30 years.  We gathered up the necessary paperwork, filled out the necessary forms, then went online and changed his status from single to married.  Apparently this will increase the amount he receives for disability.  At least his information will be correct whether there is an increase or not.After everyone left I did a major cleaning.  All bedding, all laundry, all blankets, etc. got washed.  I also steam cleaned all of the carpets.  I think the $100 steam cleaner we bought several years ago has been a great investment as we have used it at least twice a year since we bought it and it has paid for itself many times over since then compared to renting a carpet steamer.This weekend we used our local grocery store app to buy several grocery items, mostly at loss-leader prices, to start rebuilding our stockpile of food.  I was glad to be able to use up a lot of meat and other groceries while everyone was here (we had a huge ham that we got on sale after last holiday season but never had occasion to use it until last week...everyone loved it and it freed up space in our freezer!).  Instead of running out to the store to hoard massive quantities of food like many people did at the beginning of the pandemic, we just buy $10 to $20 worth of extra food items each week (on sale of course!) and pretty soon we end up with a pretty big stockpile of food which would be really useful during an emergency.Today is National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day.  This afternoon we will run a bunch of prescription drugs that hubby never used to a local store where they are being collected for free to safely dispose of.  We didn't want to just toss dangerous drugs in the garbage but he pretty much refuses to take opiods even after the many surgeries he had so they have just been collecting up in the house; it will be good to get rid of them safely.My Amazon Prime membership is coming up for renewal.  Since I've only used it on the rare occasion to watch free movies (we mostly use Netflix) and maybe got free shipping a half dozen times over the past year, I don't think the $119 cost is worth it so that will be getting cancelled at the end of the month."},
{"title": "The Mini Family Reunion", "date": "Friday, October 23, 2020", "text": "I would like to report that we officially survived the mini family reunion we hosted at our place for a week.  Although it wasn't our first choice to host a small family reunion during a pandemic (!), the daughter wanted to see her son and grand daughter whom she hadn't seen since the baby was born plus she wanted to bring her new boyfriend that she may end up marrying to meet her dad so small family reunion at our place it was...The logic behind the trip was that it would save all involved a lot of money (free lodging at our house, free food of course, a free car to use, cheap flights to Vegas from their places on the east and west coasts, lots of free entertainment options...basically everything they would have had to pay for if they all decided to meet up on one coast or the other).  Plus we got to see the great grand daughter who is now an active three year old.  Needless to say there wasn't a lot of social distancing (I did get the lecture from my best friend who works in infectious diseases who said \"do not do that again!  You two are old!  Your husband has pre existing conditions!\"  Yikes).The week went pretty well.  We got to see the daughter, her boyfriend, the grandson and his wife and their baby.  However the massive amount of laundry, dishwashing, cleaning, and cooking we did was a bit more than expected--this is exactly why we like to do family reunions on cruise ships!  Hubby and I stayed home the entire week while the kids made occasional trips to see the Las Vegas Strip and Fremont area.  We cooked three big meals a day for everyone so we didn't eat out at all during the visit, I like to bake so there was always lots of goodies to snack on, and everyone just sort of chilled out during the week (they actually wanted to relax at home instead of doing many tourist activities).  It was also nice to rotate through a lot of our stockpiled food which we will work on building up again.Overall this was one of the most money-saving vacations for all involved.  We had a great time seeing everyone again, the great grandbaby was so cute and good natured, and while we usually treat everyone to meals out and attractions which didn't happen this time, everyone was well-fed and our Netflix subscription got a good workout while everyone was here!p.s. the above picture is from a sunrise we captured while carting everyone to the airport early in the morning (otherwise we are never awake at sunrise!)."},
{"title": "10 Things From This Week", "date": "Sunday, October 11, 2020", "text": "In no particular order...We are continuing to grow our little stockpile of food (see photo above, this is in addition to the full pantry in our house).I just learned that Vitamin D is a hormone and not a vitamin.  How did I not know that all of these years???I also learned that there is such a thing as psychogenic fever, where stress or trauma can cause a person to have a fever, sometimes for weeks or months on end.  Another one to add to my store of odd maladies...The Library of Congress blog has a cool post they do every so often where they ask the public for help identifying pictures in their archives.  Here is the newest mystery photo contest and here is an older one (for more see the sidebar on their blog).We have been pretty happy with our three-month trial using Mint's cell phone plan so I renewed both of our accounts for a year more of service.  At $15 per month ($180 each for the year) per phone for unlimited texting and calling and 3GB of data, I think it is a great bargain!Today I am voting.  I requested a permanent mail in ballot as it makes it easier to research each candidate or ballot issue and take my time voting (as opposed to trying to make a list of what I want to vote for and take the list to the voting booth).  I'm really glad I am voting at home as our ballot for this election is four huge pages long!I wasn't really surprised when I came across this article about the middle class being priced out of the new car market.  Our last car cost $25k which I thought was reasonable; of course we are hoping to keep it for a minimum of 20 years!  My friend's son just bought a new truck for $75k (for a truck!!! OMG) and when we priced new vans, they have increased almost $10k in the last five years!  Needless to say I hope never to need/buy a new car again in my lifetime.Amazon Prime Day (days?) is October 13th and 14th.  As usual, we probably won't buy anything as there is nothing we need.  I also read that many other retailers will look at different ways of doing Black Friday this year so their stores won't be overwhelmed with people.  On the flip side, there are also people calling for a boycott of Prime Day.We are looking forward to seeing the daughter, grandson, his wife, and their daughter when they arrive this week.  Obviously during a pandemic is not the best time to travel but this is when they wanted to come so we hope everything works out OK.  There has been so much violence in Las Vegas over the past few months we are going to suggest they go to tourist places outside of Las Vegas (they mentioned going to the Grand Canyon and maybe Zion which would be a great experience for them).Politics, social media, regular media...everything is awful in regards to, well, nearly everything right now.  I try to watch home and garden shows as much as possible because I find them relaxing.  Speaking of which, I have been watching 'Sell This House!' on TV a lot so when we heard we were going to have guests, instead of feeling like I should renovate the house or run out and buy new stuff to make our house look better, I just did what they do on the show and deep cleaned each room, removed any clutter or extra stuff, and changed furniture around for a new look.  Now our house looks great and it didn't cost anything to do this!I hope you are enjoying the fall, avoiding all of the contentious stuff online and most importantly, I hope you vote!"},
{"title": "This Week in Frugality", "date": "Sunday, October 4, 2020", "text": "We've just been going along as usual, trying to avoid politic and the pandemic (a bit difficult when the worst presidential debate in history was quickly followed by the president being hospitalized with the coronavirus!).  It is still 100-ish degrees every day (and it's October!) and still no rain.  As you can see in the photo above, our neighbors have already decorated for Halloween.  In frugal news...I used an $8.99 coupon that came in our junk mail to get a haircut at Great Clips.We got the tires rotated for free at Discount Tire (we do this annually and it is indeed free although we do tip the guy who does the work).  They would have charged an arm and a leg to do the tire rotation at the dealership.Using the app for our local grocery store, we got four pounds of strawberries for 49 cents a pound.We will pick up hubby's prescriptions tomorrow at the military base (free).  Fortunately all of his prescriptions are for 90 days but I reorder them the minute I can because we don't want to be caught short on medication should the base shut down again due to the pandemic.We have been continuing to add to our food stockpiles.  The daughter, her boyfriend, her son, his wife, and their baby (hubby's great grand daughter!) will be coming to visit in a couple weeks so all of this food will go to good use.Finally hubby's disability increase from the VA was settled which resulted in a minor windfall of money and a big jump in the disabled veteran discount on our car registration that is offered by our county (where a regular registration would cost $350 a year, with the discount we will pay around $40 a year).In not-frugal news, my nephew just bought a house in Los Angeles (his first as his job had him working all over the world before so he is happy to settle down in one place) and he paid $805k for it!  He wanted to buy a house where he is currently living in Santa Monica but he said he couldn't find anything for under two million dollars so he settled for a little ways outside of Santa Monica.  Those prices are literally insane!"},
{"title": "Another Quick Update", "date": "Monday, September 28, 2020", "text": "Still not much happening around here but just a quick catch up...First of all, it is way too early to even start thinking about Christmas but apparently retailers don't feel the same way.  In every major store we go to (this is Costco), they have Christmas stuff out.  What about Halloween?  What about Thanksgiving?  ayayay  And of course it is still smoky here in Las Vegas.  California still has a lot of wildfires going on so the smoke rolls over this way.  Did I mention it has been nearly 160 days and we haven't had a single drop of rain?  Another ayayay  But that hasn't stopped the pools in Las Vegas from being open.  We are still stockpiling things in case there is another shutdown this fall/winter.  It may be a bad flu season along with the pandemic so we never know what could happen.  We are generally pretty well stocked up on food and supplies anyway but every time we go to a store we add a little extra to our basket \"just in case\".Five things I've decided I don't like since the pandemic: being around a lot of people (I'd so much rather stay home than go out anywhere), politics (this political season is the worst in my memory!), going to restaurants (for some reason the service and food seem pretty bad and the prices have increased...I'd rather cook at home!), wearing clothes (I mean, I do wear clothes but seldom \"dress up\"...I think I have gone to DefCon 4 of laziness!), and spending money (I go into stores or look at deals online and still can't find a single thing I want to buy).  I wonder if these changes will be permanent?"},

{"title": "The Evacuation Bag", "date": "Thursday, September 17, 2020", "text": "Fortunately we haven't had to evacuate our area but several friends and relative on the west coast were waiting for orders to evacuate their homes because of wildfires (fortunately none of them ended up having to leave) and I've been keeping and eye on Lorraine's blog because she lives right where Hurricane Sally hit (fortunately she didn't end up evacuating either).  We don't really have any natural disasters common to our area but as we learned when we made several trips to the ER in the middle of the night due to hubby's health problems, it pays to be ready to leave your house on a moment's notice and the only way to do that is to have a \"evacuation bag\" packed and ready to go.  So today we took a bit of time to dump out the evacuation bag we always keep in the car and check the contents to make sure we weren't missing anything.  Here's what we keep in our bag:A bag.  It's an Osprey Perrigee 29 litre bag that holds both of our stuff.One change of clothes for each of us; this includes socks, underwear, work out pants, and tops.A fleece jacket (me) and rain jacket (hubby).  We actually keep several jackets in the car because casinos are always so cold year round that we usually take a jacket with us every time we go into a casino.A toiletry kit: comb, razor, nail clipper, nail file, shampoo, conditioner, sunscreen, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, lotion, mirror, floss, soap, packet of kleenex, tampons, makeup (brow liner, eye liner, concealer, lipstick, eye shadow, powder)KnifeTowel from REi that packs up really smallCarabinerSpace PenTiny Maglight flashlightSpace blanketRain ponchoCompassParacordSharpieHeadlampExtra batteriesBattery banks (2).  I try to remember to charge these monthly.Ear budsAM/FM radioCell charging cord (standard with an additional type C tip)USB drive with all of my computer files backed up on itMini can openerSporkMatchesSuper GlueRubber bandsSafety pinsSticky note paperMasks and gloves (newly added because of the pandemic)Ziploc bags in assorted sizesFirst aid kit: bandaids, alcohol wipes, neosporin, Thera Flu, Tylenol, moleskin, Ibuprofen, Benadryl, condoms (can be used as a tourniquet), two day's worth of hubby's medicationsFood (granola bars) We always keep a case of water in the car as well as box of tissue and pack of Costco wipes, and I have made an \"evacuation checklist\" so we won't forget other important things like our EDC bags, hubby's medication box, a box of camping gear (tent, sleeping bags, stove, water purifier, etc), laptops, a tub of food from the pantry, firearms/ammo, etc.This is a pretty basic collection of stuff but it would take care of our needs should we end up at a hotel overnight, at the hospital for a few days, etc."},
{"title": "A Quick Update", "date": "Sunday, September 13, 2020", "text": "It's been ages since I've blogged!  Pretty much because there isn't much happening around here so I didn't have much to write about but here is the boring stuff that's been happening...Las Vegas has been getting a lot of smoke from the California wildfires (see photo above of the sun at mid afternoon a few days ago).  If it is that bad here, I can't even imagine how bad the smoke is in California, Oregon, and Washington!  eeekkkThe weather has gone from hot hot (110 to 115 degrees) to just regular hot (100ish degrees).  We have gone 146 days with no measurable rain (!), and went 45 days in a row with temps over 100 degrees (!!).  Needless to say its been kind of a miserable summer where outside activities are concerned.  Fortunately the weather is getting better but I really miss our annual monsoon season.We have been doing our usual low-key activities--hubby bowling and playing poker a couple days a week plus weekly shopping trips.  Apparently there has been a lot of chaos around town in the evenings but we are always safely in our home by dusk.  Not that we would want to be walking the Strip with thousands of germy people now anyway but people seem to have lost their damn minds lately not just here in my city but everywhere!I've lost any and all desire to shop.  Now sure where I lost it but it is gone.  I've been to several stores where usually I would be excited to buy stuff (clothes, bags, outdoor gear, shoes) but now when I go into a store it's like \"meh, I don't need or want anything here\".  I'm not sure what's wrong with me...Well that's my exciting life in Vegas, hopefully with the cooler weather we will get out more and do some fun activities soon!"},

{"title": "10 Things from This Weekend", "date": "Sunday, August 23, 2020", "text": "In no particular order...Did you know that you can get paid for being a 'Karen'?  Apparently you can!Even though school is still up in the air for many, here is a giant list of free and low-cost resources for college students.Another note on schools, you can often Google your area/school district and find information on lots of services for kids (in our area there was a free immunization clinic, sign-ups for free meal delivery while kids are doing school from home, free school supply backpack events, etc).The census is still hiring if you are looking for an interesting temporary job.Speaking of temp jobs, many areas are hiring for poll worker jobs too right now (example from my area).Tuesday is free entrance day to the national parks to celebrate the National Park Service's Birthday.Reddit frugal is full or great, cheap ideas.  Here is another thread with lots of money-saving ideas.A quick note that the growing season will be wrapping up within the next month or so.  Now is a great time to ask to glean farmer's fields after the harvest, plan and plant your fall/winter garden, and ask friends for leftovers if their garden is too productive for them to handle.If you live in the Gulf Coast I probably don't need to tell you that you should really be prepared for a hurricane (two are heading to the area now).  But everyone should have an idea of how to prepare for hurricanes whether you live in a hurricane-prone area or are just there for vacation.And on our side of the country, we haven't seen the sun in days because the smoke from all of the California wildfires is coming our way.  Not great for us, but even worse for the folks in California.  Again, being prepared for wildfires is always a good idea!Have a great rest of your weekend!"},
{"title": "101 Ways We Save Money in Retirement", "date": "Wednesday, August 19, 2020", "text": "Actually hubby is fully retired and I am retired-ish but still do occasional gig work (but I definitely need to develop some sources of retirement income!).  Here are a bunch of ways we live frugally in retirement:We chose to live in a state with no state income tax.  This works well for us, but it makes sense to look at overall tax burden by state when deciding where to retire.  Note that there are many states that have state income tax yet don't tax various types of retirement income.We bought a newish house at the bottom of the market.  It has now more than doubled in price since the housing market has significantly increased in value over the past decade.  I don't even know how new home buyers afford $300k \"starter homes\" these days!We used a VA loan (zero down, many closing costs paid by the VA) to buy our house.  We also bought a house for a fraction of the amount we were pre-approved for.  No way did we want a huge house payment when we could live happily in a smaller, less expensive house.We decided to downsize to a smaller house in part because a smaller house is much cheaper to heat, cool, and maintain.  Our house is in an area which has a very low property tax rate as well as a tax cap so property tax can't increase dramatically year over year.  Many of our family members live in New England where their monthly property tax payments cost more than their mortgage payments!I call around each year to get the best rate for house insurance.  We bundle our house insurance with our car insurance to get a better rate and don't have things that would increase the cost of our house insurance like a pool or pit bulls.We live in a neighborhood with an inexpensive HOA.  Unfortunately almost every house in Las Vegas is part of an HOA, fortunately we chose a neighborhood that isn't gated and doesn't have a pool, golf course, or club house which can dramatically increase the monthly HOA cost.Hubby and I share one car which is much cheaper than having two or more cars like we did in years past.  This is easier to do in retirement because we don't have jobs taking us in different directions.We bought a basic car (Honda CRV) with a .9% loan from the dealership on a five year term which we recently paid off in four years.  While I would have loved to have a fancy $50k truck, a good basic car is cheaper, just as reliable, and costs less to maintain and insure.I call around each year to find the lowest-priced car insurance we can find.  I found that the cost for car insurance can vary dramatically from company to company.  We get a discount on this insurance because it is bundled with our home insurance.Speaking of insurance, we lower the cost of our home and auto insurance by having higher deductibles.  Our emergency fund can easily cover these deductibles (which is important, you don't want to have a high deductible you can't cover if you need to make a claim!).We signed up for a property tax exemption provided by our county which cuts the cost of our annual car registration by more than half.  Many counties/cities have such tax exemptions for seniors, vets, low income folks, etc.We get a good price on car maintenance services at a friend's auto shop, keep the car in good working order, and do some of our own maintenance (like changing the air filters) ourselves.We tend not to drive often or far which saves on gas as well as wear and tear on the car (in four years we have only put 34,000 miles on the car!).  I also called and got a rebate on our car insurance when we were under lockdown for covid and staying home all the time.We are safe drivers.  Car insurance is expensive in my city for everyone because drivers here are so awful.  We keep our insurance costs relatively low by driving carefully and not having DUIs/tickets/other violations.  We also have an inexpensive dashcam in our car just in case we ever do get in a wreck.I often walk to do errands like grocery shopping, banking, mailing things, etc.  This saves gas and is good exercise.Fortunately hubby's health insurance is free thanks to the military (he still has a Medicare deduction from his social security) and my health insurance is only $25 a month.  Needless to say, this is ridiculously cheap health insurance compared to the regular health insurance market.  We know several people who can't retire because they would have to pay for their own health insurance, instead of their job paying for it, and the cost would be astronomical!For dental work, we are fortunate that my sister in law is a dentist so if we need major work, she will do it just for the cost of supplies.  But since she lives across the country, I also have a great local dentist who knows I don't have dental insurance so he gives me a no-insurance discount plus an extra discount if I pay cash.  I suppose if we were desperate for dental care we would go to our local university dental school (very cheap procedures done by dental students) or march ourselves down to Los Algodones!We are pretty frugal with our utilities.  Electricity, gas, and water is charged at the rate you use it so we try to be frugal with our use of these services (there are millions of pages online with tips to save on utilities).We pay as many bills annually (HOA) or semi annually (car insurance) as we can in order to get a discount over paying monthly.I check out utility company websites occasionally and see what discounts they offer.  We have got a free energy weatherization service, a rebate on the washer/dryer set we purchased, free shower heads, etc. from these programs in the past.We use an over-the-air antenna to get 50+ free stations on TV instead of paying for cable TV.  Since we live in a city, there are LOTS of OTA TV stations; this may not be the same in rural areas.We have a Netflix subscription which provides more than enough entertainment for us and is much cheaper than cable TV.  We have basic internet.  I would love gigablast internet but the cost is more than $100 per month.  We have a step-up-from-the-bottom internet for $50 a month which works just fine for us.We just switched to Mint for our cell phone service which we are happy with.  We get unlimited calls and texts plus 3gb of internet for $15 each a month which I think is a good deal.We always buy our cell phones from the manufacturer (Samsung) or Best Buy.  We buy our phones on sale and pay in full instead of buying phones we can't afford and need to finance over two years or more.We buy our tech products (tablets, laptops, TV, etc) on sale and we choose products that meet our needs instead of buying top-of-the-line products which do way more than we need.We do a lot of our own home maintenance like changing out plumbing fixtures, and check around with friends for recommendations for inexpensive handyman work when we need it (I didn't want hubby painting the second floor exterior trim so we hired this out to a painter a friend recommended).We do our own yard work.  Fortunately it is pretty minimal but a lot of people we know hire this sort of thing done.  When I got a quote for $200 to trim our palm trees, I went online and learned how to do this myself (our $40 extendable pole saw has paid for itself several times over so far!).We use YouTube to learn how to do many maintenance and repairs which has saved us a boatload of money over the years.  The dealership wanted $90 to change the filters in our car, a YouTube video showed us how to do this and it only cost $20 for the filters!  We bought $10 key blanks on Amazon and had them cut for $10 which saved us $180 over the cost of having the dealership do this.  The list of things we have learned how to do ourselves is endless!We shop sales and buy in bulk when it comes to food.  We buy 50 pounds of rice at a time from the Asian store (we eat a lot of rice!), and get some amazing deals on weekly food purchases by using our local grocery store app.We tend to shop for food and household supplies at the cheapest places (like the Mexican grocery store or 99 Cent store for produce, the Asian grocery store for Asian food, Costco for toilet paper, Walmart for toiletry and household products, etc).We cook almost all of our meals at home.  This is both cheaper and healthier than eating out all the time.  This includes making our meals at home and taking them with us if we will be out for the day so we don't end up eating fast food.We make our own desserts and snacks at home.  I love to bake so this makes it easy but if you have a favorite item at any fast food or popular restaurant, it's guaranteed that there are a bunch of \"copy cat\" recipes online to show you how to make it yourself at home.I shop online for specific items that I know are cheaper than buying at local stores, like tablet and cell phone covers from Amazon or outdoor gear from SteepAndCheap.I have an Amazon Prime subscription which gives us free shipping, free movies, free books, etc. which I got for $20 off when there was a discount for veterans a while back.I sign up for freebies anywhere I can find them.  Examples here and here.I also look for discounts all the time too, whether it is asking for a locals discount, a veteran's discount, a senior discount, etc.We buy all of our clothes (except for shoes, socks, and underwear which are purchased new at Ross or TJ Maxx) at the Goodwill.  And we only shop on senior sale days which saves even more money!We have a Sam's Club card (which we received as a gift) and occasionally get a Costco card (if the cost will save us more on the items we want to purchase over buying the item at another store).  We tend to buy food in bulk at these places if the price is better than we can find at other stores.We buy all of our home decor and household goods (dishes, furniture like desks and bookcases, etc) at the Goodwill.  I refuse to pay full price for any sort of decor which loses 90% of its value as soon as you walk out of the store with it.  Any time we need something for our house, the first place we look is at the Goodwill!We have inexpensive hobbies.  Hubby bowls on senior leagues (cheaper than evening leagues), I enjoy walking and hiking which is free, occasionally we will swim at the local pool ($1 per person...WAY better than owning our own pool!), etc.We enjoy free events and activities in our city.  Obviously this was much more expansive pre-covid but hopefully things will get back to normal soon.  I did a free CERT class, we often attended free musical events at our local library, we've gone to free lectures, free days at the museum, and enjoyed lots of free casino shows over the years.If we do go to events or activities that cost money, we look for discounts.  This might be discounted tickets for locals, going to a matinee movie instead of an evening movie, or using services like Fill A Seat or House Seats.  I've even volunteered to work at conferences and events in order to get free entry to the rest of the event after my shift was done!We have done things as drastic as cutting each other's hair to save money (and did a good job IMHO).  Although we do like to use $7 haircut coupons that come out occasionally for our local Great Clips.We don't do debt.  No credit card use (unless we pay it off immediately), no payday loans, no buying furniture or electronics on credit, no time shares, etc).We are also minimalist (me more so than hubby) so we don't buy things unless we really need them.  I don't like having junk or clutter laying around!We have an emergency fund which has, on many occasions, saved us from putting a repair or new appliance on our credit cards.We also cash flow/DIY bigger purchases.  When one of the daughters wanted to get married here, we told her we would pay for it as long as it fit in our budget and we could cash flow it (she chose a restaurant we could afford for the reception, DIYed the invitations, etc); the entire event was wonderful!Speaking of money, when people (usually kids, grandkids, or relatives) need money we never loan it to them but offer what we can afford as a gift.  This saves a lot of drama!The kids are all self-supporting and employed.  Needless to say, this saves a lot of money over having kids still living at home.  We weren't able to be nearly as frugal with a house full of kids!We don't have pets.  Obviously this is a personal choice (I can't even see having a dog in Las Vegas when it's too hot to walk them for three months out of the year!).  We have had several dogs over the years which were pretty low-maintenance, but now our friends who have dogs spend money on clothing for them (!?!), doggy day cares, and medical care which rivals human care in price!We do as much as we can online instead of via mail or in person.  Things like banking and paying bills can easily be done online and saves the cost of a trip to the bank or a stamp for mailing.We utilize the library a lot.  Our library is great and offers all kinds of things like community events, a massive amount of e-books that I download to my Kindle for free, free movies/music/magazines, etc.When we travel, I use Google flights to search for the lowest-priced tickets as this site allows you to search by price, by day.  Obviously this is easier to do if your dates for traveling are flexible.  Ditto, in previous years, when I used Travelocity to search for cruises by the price per night.We make our own coffee at home.  I used to have an awful Starbucks (and Baskin Robbins) habit but I have kicked both.  Now hubby has his morning coffee made with our old drip coffee maker and I make my own milkshakes and smoothies at home.  This saves A LOT of money!When we do eat out (with a coupon or other discount of course!), we tend to order one meal and split it (and still end up with leftovers).  We order water to drink instead of soda and skip dessert.  This is a frugal way to have a nice meal while not overeating, plus the meals are so big we don't even miss having expensive soda or dessert with it.We are frugal in the kitchen.  Hubby washes and saves ziploc bags to use when packaging meat in single-serve portions, we cut a roll of paper towels down the middle to give us quarter-sized paper towels (a whole paper towel is generally overkill), even the water from boiling vegetables is used to water the plants!Our house is always organized.  This saves us from buying duplicate items because the item we need, like tape or scissors, were misplaced and can't be found.Our house is always clean.  We don't wear shoes in the house (makes the carpets really dirty; our very light colored carpet still looks like new because we don't wear shoes on it and keep it shampooed every six months or so), spills are cleaned up immediately so they don't leave a stain, and broken things are either fixed, given away, or tossed.We do home maintenance and repairs as needed.  This includes changing the furnace filters regularly, doing annual maintenance on our AC which should have died five years ago but is still going strong, fixing leaky faucets immediately, etc.We don't replace things that aren't broken.  Our TVs are more than ten years old but still work fine so we see no reason to get the newest and biggest TVs.  Our basic computers work just fine, our cell phones are from three generations ago but still work great, and I think our vacuum is going on 20 year old but still works fine (hubby cleans and maintains it regularly). Our tech use is pretty basic--cell phones, laptops, and a tablet.  We don't use Alexa or other assistants (too intrusive IMHO) and don't pay for apps or software.  When we do get new tech, the old stuff is either sold or given to a kid or grandkid who needs it.Our decor has been the same for ages and it still looks fine IMHO.  I used to redecorate often (including new paint and flooring when the old stuff was just fine), changed the decor with the season, and generally tried to have a \"House Beautiful\" house.  Needless to say I now find this expensive and wasteful.We are the same with clothes.  I used to have to have the newest fashions, LV and Coach purses, etc.  Now my basic Goodwill clothes and cute Kipling purses (bought on sale of course) suit me just fine.  I think this is easier to do when you don't work and don't have to impress people.Get rid of vices!  Hubby used to smoke three packs a day but quit many years ago.  That alone has saved us a boatload of money.  We don't drink, do drugs (marijuana is legal here), or have other vices that cost money.  Hubby does like to play poker but he has a small allowance for this and if it is gone for the week, he doesn't play any more (fortunately he is a good player and has saved a pretty good-sized bankroll in addition to getting \"comps\" when he plays for free meals in casino restaurants).When we cook, we usually make big batches of whatever we are making and freeze leftovers in single serve portions.  This is a great way to save on food waste and save money over eating out if we happen to be too busy to cook.We often use food and home baked goods for gifts.  If there is a party, we bring dessert, if we are visiting friends, we bring them food, when people come over, we serve them food.  Good food seems to make everyone happy.When we buy food (almost always on sale, of course) we process it immediately so it doesn't sit in the back of the refrigerator and rot.  Meat (hubby is a carnivore) is cut up and frozen in single-serve sizes, vegetables are cut up and frozen or used right away, fruit is cleaned up and frozen, etc.  I do need to learn how to can and make jam so I can stretch our discount food finds even further.We prepare for disasters.  Slowly.  Fortunately we don't get many disasters in our area but every time we go shopping, we add a small item to our disaster supplies kit whether it is a box of bandaids or a tarp from the $1 store, an extra can or two of soup that is on sale, a packet of batteries, etc.We like to \"buy it for life\" when possible.  We still use my grandmother's cast iron pan that is more than 50 years old, my backpacks have lifetime warranties, and we happily pay more for long-lasting durable items which save money over buying cheap items that are more likely to break quickly.We have food-producing trees in our back yard.  I wish we had space for a garden, unfortunately our yard is very small and gardening here is pretty challenging.  I think any effort to grow your own food, if you are into this sort of thing, is well worth the effort.We don't answer our phones if we don't know who is calling, don't open our door if it looks like someone is trying to sell something, and have freezes on our credit.  Scams and identity theft are so common these days, we try to do everything we can to avoid getting caught up in any of that.We avoid the usual scammy things: impossible to cancel gym memberships, even more impossible to cancel time shares, payday lenders, rent-to-own places, etc.I try to avoid things that will make me mindlessly shop including going to stores without specific things I need to buy, perusing deals websites, and watching too many tech review videos (I love new tech!).We buy annual memberships for things we enjoy doing like getting a senior Nevada Parks Pass which provides free entry to all of Nevada's parks for $30 and hubby has a senior lifetime membership to the National Parks (it only cost $10 when he bought it several years ago).  Some of our friends buy annual memberships to local museums, kid's play places, etc.We live below our means.  We used to live way beyond our means, assuming that since we were working we could always pay whatever bills we would rack up in the future (note that this rarely works out well even if you are earning a large salary!).  These days, with living on a fixed income, we know exactly how much we can spend and we stay below that amount.We don't buy things that can be rented or borrowed.  I just can't see buying a boat or RV when it is much cheaper and easier to rent these big ticket things but leave the cost and maintenance to someone else.  Specialized tools (except for my beloved pole saw) or other things we rarely use (like a power washer) are also great things to rent instead of buy.We have saved a lot of money by not traveling.  We used to travel several times a year but when hubby's health was unstable, we decided not to travel for a year.  Then two years.  Now with covid there is no traveling this year either.  Fortunately hubby's health has improved, and we have realized that while traveling is OK, staying home is much less hassle and much less expensive. Speaking of traveling, when we do travel, we now go one-bag only.  Each of us carries everything we need in our carry on on-sized bags so we don't need to pay ridiculous baggage fees.  We also carry snacks and empty water bottles through security and fill them up on the gate side so we don't have to buy water or snacks at the expensive airport stores.We do splurge occasionally.  When my old tablet was on its last leg I went looking for a new tablet.  I researched (excessively), found the tablet I wanted (an expensive one), waited until it went on sale, then found next to the sale price that the store had a returned tablet for an even greater discount.  I picked up the returned tablet and it works great, just like new!We take advantage of opportunities as they come up.  I often learn of deals, discounts, and cool opportunities via social media and regular media so I make note of these great deals and take advantage of them when appropriate.  There might be a lecture by my favorite author, free audience tickets for shows filmed in Vegas, free community events, etc. which we will enjoy if we have time.We use a cash back credit card for our purchases and pay it off each month.  We are careful not to overspend and always pay it at the end of each month then reap the cash-back rewards as they accumulate.Occasionally we will do a no-spend challenge.  This is a great way to save money quickly and it makes us reduce, reuse, recycle, or do without (good lessons to practice anytime!).We use less of products than is called for.  I usually use half the usual amount of laundry soap, half the amount of toothpaste you see used in commercials, mix my shampoo with water...all things that stretch the products but still produce effective results.We have actually done dumpster diving and trash picking in the past.  If we find something useful on the side of the road we will pick it up, clean it up, the use it or sell it on Craigslist.  When I used to work in an office building, entire suites of office furniture would be left by the dumpster when an office closed so we would quickly scoop it up and use it or sell it.We always shop the clearance racks at any stores we go to.  This is a great way to get great products that may be old or closing out, at big discounts.  We do this everywhere from the day-old bread rack at the grocery store to the mis-mixed paint section at Home Depot.Some unusual ways to make or save money which we have done: see if you have unclaimed money, see if you qualify for a class action rebate, and consider these weird ways to make money.I love to make a little extra money by doing temp or gig work.  Every summer (well, until this summer) I have worked a temp job at the World Series of Poker, the census is hiring in our area (I will skip applying this time due to the covid risk), I may apply to work for the elections, and in our city (pre-covid) there are always lots of weekend or week-long jobs at conventions and other events which people can do to make a little extra money.Another money saver we are considering is refinancing our mortgage.  We may do this as the APR is 1% less than we are paying now but we haven't decided if we are moving yet or we may just decide to hammer away at what's left of our mortgage and pay it off as fast as possible (which may save money over paying closing costs to get a cheaper interest rate).All of our banking accounts are free.  A few accounts are through credit unions (free) and one is through the bank that holds our mortgage (also free as long as we have a loan with them).  I can't believe some of the high fees people pay for banking when there are free options out there!I used to make a lot of websites for businesses, now I just have a few for small non profits that I help out.  To save money on this, I buy the domain names through Name Cheap and stopped paying hundreds of dollars in hosting fees by using Blogger for free hosting (I believe Google Pages and GitHub offer similar free hosting).More online things I use to save money: free software, free educational courses, and finding free services for my hobbies (like using FamilySearch for genealogy instead of paying for an Ancestry subscription).We have scaled way back on gift giving.  We used to send birthday and Christmas gifts to all of our siblings and their kids but now with five kids and 13 grandkids of our own, we limit gifts to just our immediate family.  It's still a bit expensive but better than giving gifts to nearly 100 close relatives!Some big investments we are looking at: an on-demand water heater when our current water heater dies, a new AC system (our old one still works but it is already five years past its lifespan), buying a freezer (we currently use freezers in our two refrigerators but an actual freezer would be nice), and while I would love to have solar, it doesn't make financial sense where we live because of the high cost/relatively low return (the power company doesn't pay much for solar here unfortunately).As for coupons, I don't go all out and do the \"Coupon Queen\" thing but if I see a coupon in our junk mail that we can use (for haircuts, make up, etc) I will cut it out and use it.I think one of the most important ways to stay frugal is to make lists.  I have a list of bills that need to be paid and their due dates (don't want to pay late and get a late fee added to the bill!), a list of food and household goods we are running low on (don't want to forget something then have to make a special trip back to the store because we are completely out!), and a list of \"to do\" things (don't want to forget birthdays or other tasks that need to get done!).I am forever looking for even more ways to be frugal so occasionally I will visit RedditFrugal, or simply Google \"weird ways to save money\" or \"weird ways to make money\" to find some new and unique ways to earn or save money that I haven't come across yet. Consider \"extreme\" ways to save money.  Many friends use bidets which saves on the cost of toilet paper (we are still considering whether or not to buy one of these), some people collect condiment packets to use at home (a bit too extreme for us), and the neighbor guy got tired of dealing with dead plants in his yard so he went to the dollar store and bought a bunch of plastic plants to put in his yard!We have been married for decades and this actually saves us money.  Being divorced splits assets, costs double for two separate households, and we encourage each other to be frugal which is an added bonus (hubby is actually more frugal than I am!).  Obviously not everyone gets a choice to remain married but working out problems instead of bailing is a money-saving tip!We always ask each other \"how can we do this cheaper?\"  And rather than feeling deprived when being so frugal, it is more like a fun challenge.  I guess the most important part of being frugal is your attitude towards it!"},

{"title": "10 Things from Today", "date": "Thursday, August 13, 2020", "text": "In no particular order...I got my driver's license renewed. Finally!  I had an appointment to do this back in March but they closed the DMV a few days prior to my appointment so when they reopened a month ago, I got my new appointment for today.  Everything went fine (I probably need to get my vision checked, I didn't flunk the vision test but I didn't do well with it either...I think I spend too much time on my laptop/tablet/phone screens and not enough time looking at distant things.  Or I'm just getting old.  eeekkk).  Of course even with an appointment, the DMV was still like a three-ring circus.  People and disorganization everywhere but at least I don't have to go back for another eight--or maybe 16--years!Hubby is getting good at using FB messenger/Zoom to talk to his family.  Today he set up messenger on my phone, set it on a tripod, then proceeded to teach his sister how to make the Filipino dishes he was cooking us for dinner.  It was a fun experience and she will cook this for her family tomorrow!Be sure to register to vote!  I think this election will be very crucial to our overall well being as a country.  Also be sure to get your ballot, if it is the mail-in kind, sent in ASAP.  Trump seems to be trying to defund the post office so they can't process mail in ballots.  ayayayIf you haven't done the census yet, you can do it online (and save some poor person from having to come to your house to get your info in the middle on a pandemic!).Be sure to check your local websites and see if they have any good deals for locals.  In our case, we get a good veterans discount on our car registration fee, our energy company is giving out free dryers and refrigerators, and there are also several new programs to help people financially through this covid mess.Something new on our library's ebook check-out system.  I used to go to the library website and check books out for free from the library and they somehow got delivered to my Kindle app via Amazon.  Now I have access to several more books from my favorite authors via Hoopla.  The library system and the Hoopla system used to be separate but now they are integrated so all books are checked out through the library website but they get delivered via Amazon and/or Hoopla so it seems like there are a whole lot more books available now!Covid is still doing its thing.  The numbers in our state are up, our school district is still trying to figure out what to do with 350,000 kids this school year (school is supposed to start in two weeks!), and our city is both desperate for tourists (the life-blood of the economy) and afraid of them (how many are bringing covid with them or taking away a nasty case of the virus when they leave?).  Oddly enough, house prices are still at an all-time high...a good time for us to sell if you ask me (hubby, alas, is totally happy living here so we may not be moving any time soon).I can't wait for the weather to cool off so I can walk.  I usually work half the summer at the World Series of Poker which keeps me busy and walking a lot but this summer seems to be dragging on forever with nothing to do but be stuck inside!Our local animal shelter is participating in the Clear the Shelter event for the entire month of August which means people can adopt animals for free (I think the usual cost is around $150) which is a huge savings and a great way to get animals out of shelters and into homes!Did you know that if you go outside at night and look up, you may be able to see the Perseid Meteor Shower?  It is still going on and something interesting to look at!"},
{"title": "A Quick Update", "date": "Wednesday, August 12, 2020", "text": "My last post was about bloggers disappearing and here I just noticed it has been nearly two weeks and I haven't posted anything!  Mostly because nothing is really happening and we are still in the covid holding pattern.  We do our grocery shopping, hubby bowls once or twice a week, and he plays poker once a week (see photo above, they are now playing in their own little plexiglass cubicles at the poker table!).  Still no walking for me--it's supposed to be 113 degrees this weekend!  And no unemployment for me either (right before a hearing when the unemployment department was supposed to tell the judge how much headway they have been making on their backlogged claims, the department issued mass denials to nearly everyone, me included--great way to clear out the backlog right?).  It seems like we have been doing nothing for months on end and I hate being unproductive!  I may become so bored I start painting the house or something.  On another note, here are a couple of good links about making money and gardening."},
{"title": "Mystery Solved...Unfortunately  :(", "date": "Saturday, August 1, 2020", "text": "I hate it when my bloggy friends disappear.  Carla's blog disappeared a while ago and I never did find out why (although the blog is gone, she is mentioned in this article).  And while I was saddened by Cheap Chick's last post, I was glad that she did take the time to make a quick post to let everyone know what was happening in her life.  And Gil hasn't posted in months so I am wondering what happened to her.  I know sometimes people get busy, have significant life changes they need to deal with, or simply get bored of blogging but I always wonder 'where did so and so go???'Last week I noticed one of my favorite writers, Karen Ranney, hadn't posted in a couple months.  I know in the past she would get busy with her books on deadline and not post for a bit but overall she was pretty consistent with her blog and FB posts so it was odd not seeing her post anything in a while.  I even messaged her on FB saying \"I hope everything is going well, miss your blog posts!\" and didn't hear back from her which was odd (we had exchanged messages about writer-world stuff and she always answered back quickly).  I checked her website and it had a front page post from July 28 so I figured all was OK but when I checked Twitter, I saw this post from her publisher and it reported she had died last month!  That was quite the shock.  So rest in peace Karen Ranney, I loved your books and you will be very much missed in the romance world!"},
{"title": "It's Hot!", "date": "Friday, July 31, 2020", "text": "As you can see...it's hot here!  In other news...I logged in to write this blog post and got the \"new blogger interface\".  Ick   I like the old blogger interface but I guess I will get used to this.My long list of goals to achieve this summer has mostly been put on hold because it is too hot outside to do any sort of outdoor activities.Interesting...you can track shark activity in real time here.Not that I hope any of you will experience homeless due to the current crappy economy, but I have been following CheapRVLiving on YouTube and this guy just posted a couple of good videos on the topic this past week.  Part 1   Part 2We are pretty much in the same holding pattern as we have been in for months: unemployment--none yet, lawsuit ongoing; if kids will go back to school in the fall--unknown; covid--ongoing in our area although deaths are dropping.Good news: someone just won nearly 2 million dollars at a local casino.  I very rarely gamble so this probably will never happen for me but it is exciting news to hear that someone got a windfall.We have hardly shopped at all, except for groceries, in ages.  I simply don't feel like shopping and there is nothing we really need so I guess that is overall a good thing.I hope you are all having as nice a summer as is possible in these unusual circumstances!"},
{"title": "We Switched to Mint!", "date": "Sunday, July 26, 2020", "text": "I've been hearing a lot of good things about the Mint cell phone plan but I've been too lazy to switch over.  Finally I added this task to my \"to do\" list and last week we made the switch.  With TMobile we paid $65 a month for two cell phone lines but with Mint we are now paying $30 a month for two phone lines!The switch was super easy--just sign up online and they send you a new sim card within a couple days.  Put the card in your phone, register it on their website with your current carrier info, and within minutes we were off of the TMobile plan and on the Mint plan.  I've noticed no change in service (Mint uses TMobile cell towers which is probably why everything seems the same) and I am now happy that we are saving a lot of money with this new service.I started with their three month pre-paid plan to make sure we liked the service but after three months we will probably do the one-year prepaid plan (I love paying bills annually so I don't need to worry about them for an entire year).  Seems like a great deal to me!"},
{"title": "The Covid Dilemma", "date": "Tuesday, July 21, 2020", "text": "We seem to be in an unending holding pattern.  First the bars opened up, then they shut down when our covid numbers started to spike.  The casinos are still open but there are always rumors they will close as well.  Our unemployment department was sued for not paying people (myself included), but so far the judge keeps giving them more and more time to get their act together (it's been a couple months since the lawsuit started and yesterday the judge once again said to give them a couple more weeks before he makes a decision).  Our schools were going to stay online for the upcoming year then they were going to partially open for a couple days a week now it looks like they will stay closed and all school will be done online.  Hubby's weekly bowling was going along then one of the members (no names were given so we don't even know if it was someone hubby bowled with) came down with covid so no more bowling.  I guess this will be the way of things for a while longer...On another note, the SIL is coming to visit tomorrow with her friends (in the middle of a pandemic...eeekkk) and the guy who lives down the street murdered his girlfriend last week (he is some actor I've never heard of).  At least it is monsoon season so we will get a break from the 110 degree weather and hopefully some summer storms..."},
{"title": "Covid and Other Things", "date": "Thursday, July 16, 2020", "text": "Things are still pretty much the same here.  Our covid numbers are spiking, and our government is trying to balance on the fine line between closing down everything again and losing most of the funding for the state (a majority of state funding comes from casinos and hospitality) and keeping things open and just hoping more and more people don't keep catching the virus.  Hubby and I stay home most of the time except for grocery shopping trips and hubby's once a week bowling league in which everyone stays pretty far away from each other. In other news...this blog has been spammed like crazy with comments even though anyone that posts needs to do a word verification process.  I guess the spammers have figured out a script for this?I'm kind of a science geek so I thought it was cool this guy runs his blog on solar power.This post '50 Ideas that Changed My Life' was a good read.I saw this story on the news about a little boy that saved his sister from a dog attack and the next time we go out to the desert, I'm going to collect some rocks and send them to him.  Hopefully I can find some cool rocks with fossils in them!Two more science geek things: this explanation of the periodic wall of elements and this covid risk chart.Finally, I came across this interesting (macabre?) video of the protocol for airlines after a plane crashes.  You can literally find everything on YouTube these days!"},
{"title": "When Everything is Awful", "date": "Saturday, July 11, 2020", "text": "Sometimes it seems like we are being bombarded on all sides with awful news.  Fortunately awful days are few and far between but today just seems pretty sucky...I opened my feedreader and this post came up on top.  I've followed Cheapchick's blog for years and this was just terribly sad news.Since yesterday the conspiracy boards have been lit up with the Wayfair pedo conspiracy.  Who knows if this is true but literally it seems like there is a new scandal that sets off the internet every. single. day.  And this headline, 'US is approaching one of the most unstable times in its history' certainly didn't do anything to improve things.It's ridiculously hot here.  So no outdoor activities at all.32% of US households missed their July housing payments.  This is certainly foreboding and will impact our entire economy...or what's left of it.Personally I am feeling fat and frumpy and disappointed that the state is dragging its feet on unemployment as I had hoped to use that money to pay off the car by now.  Apparently our state is out of money to pay unemployment so there's that.We are heading into what will most likely be a nightmare election season.Fights--physical fights--over masks are a daily occurrence.Just a downer day.  Hopefully things turn around but it looks like things will get worse before they get better.  Also, I couldn't comment on Cheapchick's blog but her and her family have my deepest prayers...I will definitely be praying for a miracle for her and her family!"},

{"title": "A Quick Update", "date": "Friday, July 3, 2020", "text": "14 years ago we went to Fanning Island which is a part of Kiribati.  It's a couple day cruise away from Hawaii in the south Pacific and is one of the remotest palaces on earth.  It was a one day stop on a long cruise we took and, like I often do when we go anywhere new, we stopped by the clinic on the island (not one of these huts but it did have a dirt floor and was quite rudimentary).  I talked to a nurse at the clinic and sent her medical supplies when we got back home until the cruise ships no longer went there so there was no way to get packages to the island after that (we could send packages to the cruise ship that had remote places on their itinerary and they would deliver the package the next time they made a stop at the island).Fast forward to a couple days ago when I got a Facebook message from a girl asking if I remembered her mom who was the nurse I had met on the island.  I was pretty surprised and thrilled to #1, learn the lady still remembered me and told her daughter about me, #2, find out the lady was retired and had moved to higher ground in the island chain although her daughter still lives on Fanning Island (the entire country could soon be under water due to climate change), and #3, find out that they have access to the internet in a place that before didn't even have electricity.  Also number 4...I think you can find anyone through Facebook these days!  It was a nice surprise and we have been messaging everyday since she first contacted me!In other news, I still haven't received unemployment yet and this has now become a lawsuit, I was hoping the pharmacy would reopen soon on base so we could get all of hubby's prescriptions for free but that doesn't look like it will happen with the rise in covid cases that is currently happening (so I will pay to order them online), hubby's VA claim is still in limbo due to the company I am dealing with to get this done, and finally, a friend emailed me from Japan and asked if I was OK and if she could do anything to help me (seems their news makes the US look like a war zone with the pandemic and violent protests and who knows what other news they are getting about us...yikes!). We have no plans for the 4th of July and our neighbors go all out with fireworks (they literally spend thousands of dollars on illegal fireworks and put on shows that rival the commercial fireworks shows!). so we will probably just stay home and see what the neighbors do with fireworks this year.I hope you all have a wonderful 4th of July in this new and weird world we are living in!"},

Yikes!  After bingo we checked out the rest of the casino and were surprised at how busy it was.  The poker room was busy (but only four players per table instead of 10...hubby will wait to play poker since he doesn't want to be that close to people yet), the bowling center was open and had quite a few people bowling, the restaurants had people eating there but no buffet yet, and judging by the license plates in the parking lot, it looked like a lot of people escaped from California to come to Vegas this weekend!On another note, I saw this interesting service by Zappos--where they help you with literally anything--which sounds cool but I haven't tried it yet, and if you like hunting, this business will pay someone $1000 to binge watch a hunting show!"},

{"title": "Precisely 2.5 Months of Quarantine", "date": "Sunday, May 31, 2020", "text": "Seriously, I thought 2020 would be a great year full of wondrous possibilities.  So far it has been a really weird year.  We began our self-imposed COVID-19 isolation and quarantine (basically staying home unless we needed to get groceries) precisely two and a half months ago, since then we have endured boredom, supply shortages, food shortages, food prices increasing dramatically, the debate over mask vs no mask, lines for people just to get into stores, filing for unemployment, and the latest, protests in our city which are not pandemic related but seem to be the icing on an already crappy cake.  Fortunately our local protests have been pretty calm, but it seems like the world, or at least our country, is on the fast track to destruction.  Yikes!Fully a third of our population is unemployed, and our entire state is pretty much funded by casinos and hospitality businesses which will have a tricky return to \"normal\".  I was really looking forward to working at the WSOP this summer, and hubby and I are putting on the pounds because it seems like all we do is cook and eat!  I miss walking, and it seems like summer came a month early with 100+ degree temps in May.  I'm just waiting for the earthquakes and locusts to show up...But enough with the pity party.  Hubby and I have actually been really fortunate over the past few months.  We weren't impacted financially by the pandemic, we had plenty of food and supplies, and it was kind of nice to only fill up the gas tank in the car once in more than two months because we stayed closer to home and walked everywhere to do our errands.  I filed for unemployment and will patiently wait for it to shake out, meanwhile some people have gone 12 weeks (!) without any money at all so I really can't complain.  Our casinos are reopening next week, hubby's bowling league is excited to get back to bowling (???), and we have actually saved a lot of money over the last couple months because we haven't been shopping for anything but food.Since I have literally nothing to do this summer, I have decided to make this the most amazing summer no matter what happens.  I have a plan (sort of), and there are several things I want to accomplish (I'm writing up my list and will post it when it's done).  Here's to a wonderful summer for all of us!"},

{"title": "100 Frugal Food Tips", "date": "Tuesday, May 26, 2020", "text": "Many news sources are reporting big jumps in the price of food, mostly due to the pandemic and supply chain issues.  While we haven't seen that happen here yet, it may be because we are usually super frugal when it comes to food everyday, not just during a crisis.  Here are a bunch of tips for saving money on food...If you qualify, apply for SNAP benefits.  If you have kids, apply for WIC.  Especially during this difficult time, apply for any help you qualify for!Hit up food banks, food pantries, and other free meal sites.  If you qualify, sign your kids up for free or reduced meal plans at school.  This is a great way to stretch your food and food dollars for those who qualify.Ask friends and relatives for food if necessary (most parents would love to give their kids any food they need, even if said kid was 50 years old!).  See if your community has food share/private food donation systems in place.  There are also Facebook pages for this!Start a small, inexpensive, garden.  If you don't have room at your home for this, look into community garden plots.Google for free seeds and other freebies for your garden.If you aren't into gardening, consider sprouting and re-growing food scraps which are simple activities that require very little work on your part.Ask to glean farmer's fields after the harvest.  Even neighbors with fruit trees may let you pick what you need just for asking.Forage in your area for wild edibles.  Also look for wild apple/nut/fruit trees, wild berry patches, etc in your local area.Barter for food with others.  If you bake and your neighbors have chickens, a loaf of bread for some eggs would be a great trade.Shop sales at your local grocery stores (check out the ads online and make a list before you go shopping for best results).Use the grocery store's app if it will save you even more money.  We always get amazing deals with our local grocery store's app.Shop at $1 and 99 Cent stores but only buy things that actually save you money (ie: some canned items are 88 cents a can at Walmart yet $1 a can at the Dollar Store.  Also beware of smaller packages of popular items like half-sized cake mixes for $1 when you can buy a whole cake mix at the regular store on sale for $1).Shop at ethnic food stores.  For some reason our Mexican and Asian grocery stores have really good sale prices compared to regular grocery stores, like six avocados for $1 compared to 88 cents per avocado at a regular store.Stock up on sale items when possible (if the limit of an item in two per purchase, we will either go to the store a few days in a row to buy two of the sale items in order to stock up or hubby and I will shop separately and we will each buy two of the sale item).Shop at membership stores like Costco or Sam's Club if it makes financial sense for you. If you don't shop membership stores often, go with a friend who has a membership and pay them for your items after checkout.Keep a grocery price book so you will know what a \"good price\" on each grocery store item is (it's hard to remember the lowest price you pay for every single item in the grocery store).Also use coupons, double coupons, etc. when possible (although videos of people spending 20+ hours a week on this are a bit cringe-y).Cook from scratch.  Almost always, it is cheaper and healthier to make food at home than to buy processed products.Use your freezer.  We freeze a lot of items that we buy on sale in order to extend its shelf life, we freeze leftovers, we freeze excess produce, sauces, etc.Cook double batches of food and freeze half for a future meal.  We do this all the time as hubby doesn't like leftovers but he does like being able to pull out a frozen meal, heat it up, and eat with minimal work and fuss.Learn how to preserve your own food.  This can range from canning and pickling to drying, freezing, and smoking excess food.Buy things in the least processed form possible then cook it up yourself.  A can of beans may cost $1 but an entire bag of dried beans which would make the equivalent of several cans of beans may also cost $1 so buy the dried beans and boil them yourself.Speaking of cooking things yourself, I happen to love my Instapot (bought on sale for half off, of course).  I tend to burn beans and rice when I cook these things in a regular pan but an Instapot cooks them perfectly.Also consider bulk cooking either once a month or each weekend in order to save time and effort over cooking three meals each day.  I usually cook an entire bag of steel cut oats in the Instapot then freeze individual portions which I can then take out each day and have a whole breakfast in minutes instead of trying to cook steel-cut oats every day.Drink water with your meals.  Or better yet, only drink water.  This is healthier than soda, juice, milk, and any other beverage except maybe tea.Take your meals to work and school everyday.  This is way healthier and cheaper than buying your breakfast/lunch every day.  Obviously a free school meal is cheaper but probably isn't healthier than what you can make at home.Be sure to rotate your food, both canned and everything in the freezer/refrigerator, regularly so you aren't wasting food due to spoilage.Go meatless more often.  Ideally everyone would go vegan--it's a super healthy way to eat--but the less meat you eat, the less you will spend on food and the healthier you will be.Avoid restaurants and fast food.  This is one of the most expensive, and often the least healthy, ways to eat.On the rare occasion we eat out, hubby and I will split a meal, order water to drink and no dessert, and often still have leftovers to take home.Take advantage of free meals out.  We use hubby's casino comps for meals out (it's a free bonus so why not?), and occasionally get freebies through deals we find online like a free Whopper at Burger King.Sign up to receive free food and treats on your birthday!Carry food with you (or keep a supply at work or in your school locker like granola bars, jerky, etc) so you won't be tempted to use the vending machine or eat out because you forgot to bring your lunch from home.  We also keep a supply of bottled water and granola bars in the car for the same reason, otherwise it is too easy to pick up fast food when we are out and about and get hungry.Invest in items that make your to-go-from-home food easier to take with you.  We have Contigo thermoses to take hot and cold drinks from home, plenty of individual-sized reusable food containers, sporks, ziploc bags, and reusable wax wraps all of which make taking food with us to eat on the go simple and easy.Don't get addicted to places like Starbucks.  The morning coffee at the drive-thru habit will become the bane of your existence (speaking from experience here).If you do have a particular addiction to a popular restaurant item, Google for recipes to make the exact same thing at home (the internet is loaded with copy cat recipes for most all popular fast food items).Consider learning how to cook staples like bread, tortillas, soup, granola, etc.  Again, there are recipes and how-to videos galore on this topic and making these items yourself is both cheaper and healthier than similar store-bought items that are loaded with preservatives.Make a weekly menu based on store sale items.  For example, one $5 roast chicken from the grocery store deli can make a half dozen meals--chicken dinner, chicken tacos, chicken Caesar salad, chicken pot pie, chicken fried rice, and chicken soup.Experiment with cooking your favorite ethnic food dishes at home.  We love a range of ethnic foods but in order to avoid eating out, we can pretty much skip Asian, Middle Eastern, and Italian restaurants because we can easily cook these meals at home (thanks mostly to YouTube!).  I am still not good at cooking Indian food but I am working on it. Consider making your hobbies food-related such as hunting, fishing, shell fishing, truffle hunting, etc, Stretch your food dollars by making meals that \"stretch\".  Spaghetti, tacos, soups, fried rice...these are good ways to stretch meals with minimal amounts of food over, say, the cost of a slab of steak for each person in the family.Don't let food go to waste.  After using the meat off a chicken the carcass can be used for soup.  After cutting bread, the crumbs can be saved for breading fried foods.  After peeling vegetables the peelings can go in the compost bin.  Bits of leftover meat and vegetables can be used for fried rice, soups, stews, etc.Stock up when items go on sale.  You might not need ten cans of tuna, but if tuna is on sale for 50 cents a can, buy all you can for future use!Eat less.  I'm not talking about starvation levels of sustenance, but the average American meal has morphed from 500-800 calories per meal to 1200 to 1800 calories per meal (which is why Americans are so fat these days!).  Stop the endless snacking.  Growing up, I can't remember anyone doing the non-stop snack thing like most people do these days.  We had breakfast, lunch, a small snack after school, and dinner.  That's all.  These days people can easily eat every single hour of the day because snacks are so easy to buy and accessible.When you do make after school snacks and desserts, make items that are big yet inexpensive.  A bowl of ice cream per person can be expensive but popcorn is an inexpensive, filling treat.  Ditto a cake (without the frosting is fine) which can cost $1.50 to make yet feed a dozen people.Don't grocery shop every day.  It's easy to spend extra money at the store just because you see something interesting but by shopping only weekly or every other week (with a list!) you can save a lot of money.Similarly, it is a good idea to pick a couple of nearby stores to patronize weekly instead of going to a dozen stores each week.  You won't be tempted to spend extra money and you will save time and gas as well.Use the internet to find thousands (literally!) of ways to stretch your food dollars.  Both reddit and YouTube are fonts of information on the topic as is general Googling.When you host a party, consider making it a potluck in order to both have an enjoyable event but also save money on food.Make cooking a family activity.  Whether it is baking together, growing a garden together, or trying new recipes together, the whole family will learn valuable skills by doing this, be more inclined to eat what they make, and save money both now and in the long run (I know some college kids who never even learned to boil water so they eat out for every single meal!).Make it a point to try one new kind of food each week.  Make \"sloppy Joes\" out of cheap lentils (it's cheaper, healthier, and introduces the family to a food item they may have never tried before).  A big bag of chia seeds is around $5 at Costco and is an interesting item to try in chia pudding.Occasionally eat your food stockpile down to the bare minimum.  This allows you to skip shopping for two or more weeks and also challenges you to use up the food that you have (definitely an exercise in creativity!).Look for alternate sources of food like a local food co-op, a local u-pick farm, a CSA (community supported agriculture program), etc.Make your own beverages.  Herbal teas can be made from scratch as can \"sun tea\".  For people with an appetite for alcohol, wine making and home brewing can be fun hobbies with a useful end product.  And if your family must drink soda, consider getting a soda maker.If you have friends and family nearby who are also trying to be frugal with food, consider buying large amounts of food in bulk, splitting the cost, and sharing the item (like a 50 pound bag of rice divided by 5 people, ditto a 50 pound bag of flour, buying a half a cow, etc).  Make sure the price of this works out better than buying smaller sizes.Speaking of which, always pay attention to unit prices of each item you buy in order to make sure you are getting the best deal.  Many times I've noticed that the larger item may look like a better deal but when you look at the price per ounce compared to a smaller size, it actually costs more!Hit up thrift stores to buy good quality yet very cheap cooking implements.  A good pan makes cooking so much easier and turns out better results but they can be expensive if you buy it at a department store.  My favorite, very expensive crepe pan only cost a few dollars at our local Goodwill.  Ditto cast iron pans, waffle makers, knives, etc.Most people can't live without coffee and will spend thousands of dollars each year on the stuff at Starbucks/coffee stands/Keurig cups/etc. when it is super easy and super cheap to make your own coffee at home.The presentation of food can make a cheap meal something special.  Cheap, simple food presented in a bento box in one example.Look for substitutions if you can't find or can't afford certain items your recipe requires.  Here's an example.Do without.  Years ago when year-round produce was either really expensive or unavailable, the answer was to do without.  We often ate canned tomatoes until they came available the next growing season.Similarly, try to eat in season as this is usually cheaper.  Strawberries in the spring are cheap and tasty.  Strawberries in the winter are often expensive and don't taste that great (except for frozen strawberries, so be sure to freeze lots of these when they are in season for late winter eating!).If food is your addiction (a la My 600 Pound Life), do what you can to kick the addiction.  Much like alcohol, drugs, etc, fixing an addiction to food will save you money and make you healthier at the same time.Look towards poorer cultures to learn about stretching food dollars.  China, India, African countries, etc. all make amazing food out of very cheap ingredients.  There are many YouTube videos and recipes online to introduce you to these amazing food cultures which will allow you to save money at the same time.Check out local farmer's markets, especially at the end of the day on Sunday when the farmer is much more likely to discount their items so they don't have to pack them up and take them home.Be aware of all of the tricks grocery stores use to make you buy more (and don't fall for them!).Always check the day-old bread rack, the discount meat bin, and other discount areas of your grocery store to find great deals on older/discontinued/scratch and dent items.Check bulk bins if your store has these, and see if the prices are cheaper than buying the same items in the regular grocery section (oats, rice, lentils, etc may or may not be cheaper when bought this way).Keep a range of spices on hand.  Good spices can turn bland and boring food into interesting, tasty food in a snap.  Note that spices can be cheaper at ethnic stores as well as when you buy them in \"spice jar sets\" at Walmart or Target.Consider raising your own animals for food like chickens for eggs or goats for milk, pigs, cows, etc.  Of course you will want to figure the cost ahead of time and see if this would actually save you money.If you pay your credit card off each month, consider using your credit card to pay for groceries if it gives you cash back on your purchases.  If you don't pay off your credit card each month, don't even consider this.Consider dumpster diving for food.  It sounds weird but there is a whole subculture of people who do this, sometimes with amazing results!If you must get a job during college or a second job to pay off your bills, consider getting a job that comes with food (I waitresses through college and basically ate at the restaurant five days a week which really saved me money on food).Never turn down leftovers.  Whether it means taking home a doggie bag from your restaurant meal or graciously taking home leftovers from a party or potluck, food is food and this will save you money.If you are in a special group where you can get food, take it.  Many schools, elementary through college, have food pantries for kids to take food home to eat over the weekend for those in need.  Many veteran's organizations have tables of food for vets who come to their events to take food.  Community meetings often provide snacks for attendees.Store your food appropriately so it doesn't go bad.  Store 50 pounds of rice or other grains in pest-proof buckets.  Store cereals and crackers in air-tight container so they don't go stale.If you have something nice, or not nice, to say about a food product, write the food company with your rant or rave, often they will send coupons or even totally free products to people who do this.Consider gimmicky ways to get free/free-ish food like the Never Ending Pasta Pass, doing a food eating challenge, or using the power of social media.Process your food as soon as you get home from shopping.  Hubby has a whole system which includes dating items like eggs or plant milk so we use the oldest first. He also cleans and de-veins shrimp before freezing them in single-serve packages, opens bulk packages of meat and divides it up into single serve portions before freezing, etc. Buy food in the cheapest form possible than process it yourself,  If a block of cheese is cheaper, shred it or slice it yourself,  If a side of pork is cheaper than a certain cut, buy the side and cut it up yourself.If you eat a lot of salads, cut up all of your vegetables salad bar style so you can throw together a salad in minutes right before meals or heading out to work.If you must eat out, consider cheaper times (lunch instead of dinner, happy hour), using coupons or Groupons, going to a buffet, splitting meals, and skipping premium items like drinks, appetizers, and desserts.Also if you must eat out, consider picking up take out yourself instead of using Door Dash/Uber Eats/GrubHub.  It will save the cost of delivery and tip which can really add up over time.When shopping, use a calculator to keep track of the total cost of your purchases.  Hubby does this every time we shop and we often find that items don't ring up right so we catch it immediately instead of paying more than we should.Experiment with different brands then make notes in your price book about the results.  We've found some store brands and generic brands are really good so we buy them instead of name brand items.  On the flip side, some store brands just aren't the same as the name brand item (like baked beans) so we make note of this for future purchases.Generally try to only buy items you will actually use even if the price is really low.  Just because a sale is good, it won't matter much if you won't eat it.  If you do end up with these 'great sale but we won't eat it' items, consider donating them to a food bank.Keep track of how much you spend on food each month, divided by groceries, restaurant, and coffee shop/vending/bar/etc.  This will show you exactly where your food money is going (many people are shocked at how much they spend monthly at the coffee shop!) and will show where you may want to make changes.Make your own serving-sized snacks instead of buying them.  The cost difference can be huge between buying a small packet of M & Ms ($1) and a giant container of M & Ms at Costco ($10) and putting them in snack-sized ziploc bags.Each week, clean out your refrigerator and freezer and make dinner a \"buffet\" of any leftovers in order to get rid of them instead of letting them go bad in the back of the fridge.Organize your pantry and fridge/freezer in a way that makes it easy to write up your shopping list each week.  My pantry has a row of beans, a row of spaghetti sauce, a row of salad dressing, etc. so when something is missing, it's obvious and gets written down on my list.Consider making your own kid food and baby food.  These specialized foods are often cheaper and healthier to make at home.  Don't even get me started on extruded chicken nuggets...Be intentional when you go shopping.  Leave the kids at home, be sure you aren't hungry, don't be rushed...these things will make it less likely that you will overspend when you go grocery shopping.Do grocery budget challenges occasionally and see what happens.  There's the SNAP challenge, the $1 a day challenge, the Elon Musk challenge, etc.If you have a problem with overspending when you shop for groceries, leave your credit and debit cards at home and bring only cash.  This will keep you within the hard limit of your grocery budget.Gift homemade treats instead of expensive wine or pre-made food baskets.  We always bring food treats (homemade cheese cake, cakes, pies, etc) to events we are invited to such as parties, dinners, wakes, etc.Consider the many ways you can save money on food when you travel.  Of course a big splurge on great meals is part of travel but there is no need to make every single meal a splurge (ie: breakfast in your hotel room is often a great way to save money)."},

{"title": "The Great Bicycle Shortage", "date": "Sunday, May 24, 2020", "text": "On our walk today we saw that there was no line at our local Ross store so we went in.  Hubby found a few things he wanted but I couldn't find a single thing I either needed or wanted (after 2.5 months and I didn't need anything?? Wow).  And while there was no line to get into the store, the checkout line was about 50 people long but it moved pretty fast.  Then we stopped by Target and I noticed that like yesterday at Walmart, there was not a single bicycle available to buy!  Apparently it is the same all over the US.  We have definitely seen a lot more people riding bicycles in Las Vegas, especially along the Las Vegas Strip, which was pretty much unheard of before the shutdown.In other news, here is some information about using your HSA to buy feminine hygiene and other products which many people didn't know was possible.  Also, I didn't know there was such a thing as Facebook groups that do free-cycling and other no buy/sharing of stuff which can help people in need which sounds particularly useful during these difficult financial times.  I Googled my local area and quite a few of these groups/pages showed up!"},
{"title": "I Still Don't Like Shopping", "date": "Saturday, May 23, 2020", "text": "I used to love shopping (years ago when I was maxing out my credit cards and \"keeping up with the Joneses\").  Then we went cash only and debt free and shopping got a lot less interesting (maybe buying only what you actually can afford will do that to a person?).  But now I pretty much loathe shopping.  We had to drop off some food to people today so we made a quick run through a shopping center that we rarely get over to because hubby wanted to pick up some Filipino desserts that have been hard to find lately (we go the last box!).  They seemed to be out of a lot of items.Next we went to the Asian grocery store and the lines were so long we didn't buy anything because we didn't want to stand in line with so many people.  Next up was Walmart.  It wasn't very busy there so we grabbed some fish food and a few other things and got out of there quickly.  I did notice that you can walk through Walmart and get a quick snapshot of what items are in demand by the general public.  Apparently bicycles are a high-demand item these days...Next we went by the Ross store in the same shopping plaza and they still had a long line, since there is nothing we absolutely need we just skip any store with a line these days.  Finally we stopped by the 99 Cent store to get some garlic (another item in high demand?  They only had a couple of meager packages left).  And I was particularly horrified to see that your basic rubbing alcohol which cost about 79 cents six months ago was now selling for $4.99!!!  eeekkkk"},
{"title": "Memorial Day Weekend Already?", "date": "Friday, May 22, 2020", "text": "These are the first apricots off of our tree this season!  It's hard to believe it is Memorial Day weekend already--where did the last three months go?  Well I know where the time went, it passed as we mostly stayed home, and we will probably do the same this weekend as well.  Even though many places are opening up in Las Vegas--except casinos which will happen in a week or so--we really don't want to be out at the locals lakes and parks and mountains with tens of thousands of other people who are eager to escape from their homes after months of being stuck there.  One local park said they are limiting the number of people there to 2000(!).  On a side note, I got an email today that said I was qualified to get unemployment so I will be filing every week for the duration of what would have been my six-week work gig.  Hopefully it works out--all of that extra money, including the additional $600 per week from the CARES Act, will get our car paid off within a few weeks!"},

{"title": "Shopping...", "date": "Wednesday, May 20, 2020", "text": "...sort of.  I heard that Ross stores would reopen today so hubby and I decided to take a detour on our morning walk and see how our local Ross store was doing and maybe shop a bit.  Apparently everyone had the same idea because when we got there, a couple hours after the store opened, there were more than a hundred people in line to get into the store!  Needless to say we just kept walking and will check it out again maybe next week.  Even the local news was there taking pictures.  And of course I had to take pictures too...Later in the day we went to our local grocery store and using their store app we got lunch for SIX CENTS.  Occasionally free things will pop up on their app so we got a free roast chicken from the deli and six ears of corn for a penny each!  We also got two cases of water for 99 cents each and butter for $1.67 a pound.  We are slowly but surely stocking up our food stores in case we end up in lockdown again in the fall.Also today, I filed for unemployment.  I've never filed for unemployment before in my life so this was a new experience.  I have to believe that the people who design the unemployment website have never had to actually use it since it was pretty confusing to use.  At least I think my application went through.  Since my job that I do every summer was cancelled, I read that if a person was scheduled to start a job but that job is no longer available due to the pandemic, you can apply for unemployment through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program so I gave it a shot.  If I get paid that will be great, if I don't that's OK too but since this is a unique situation, why not try to get extra money?"},

{"title": "10 Things From Today", "date": "Wednesday, May 13, 2020", "text": "In no particular order...I woke up this morning to a beautiful, slightly belated, Mother's Day bouquet from one of my step daughters.  It was a wonderful surprise! I voted!  For this election, they are doing vote-by-mail which is a great idea.  I will see if I can do this permanently because it is so much better to be able to research the candidates and fill out my ballot at home instead of trying to figure out who to vote for at a polling place (the voter's guide isn't very useful so sometimes I end up researching candidates who aren't even in our area).I watched a crime drama last night where a girl was kidnapped and she was able to let the police know where she was by secretly hitting a couple of keys on her cell phone.  I didn't know that nearly all cell phones have this ability.  Info for Android and iOs here.Hubby got a text message that all of the Goodwill stores will open tomorrow.  We will probably go next week and avoid the big crowds that may show up there tomorrow.We went to Target today and I used a gift card I had to buy stuff like extra soap, a bottle of Tylenol etc.  We are slowly stocking up for the next possible wave of the pandemic (if we are shut down again I want to have everything we need to stay home for a few months if necessary!).I've seen it mentioned in the news several times that the cost of food is increasing.  We haven't noticed this much yet at our grocery stores (except for chicken which is $10+ for a whole, raw chicken but if you wander over to the deli you can get a whole, cooked chicken for $5!?).I checked my bank account and got my first refund from our car insurance company today.  I called a month ago and asked if they were doing any sort of refund because we have hardly been driving for the past couple months and they said yes.  I should get another refund for next month (we pay our car insurance once every six months so they will give us a 20% credit for at least two months, maybe more if the lockdown continues).Apparently people who have started being more frugal are tanking the American economy.  I know our spending habits have changed and we plan to continue to be much more frugal as we go forward so while I feel sorry for the state of the economy, we also want to be more prepared with as little debt as possible and as much savings as possible.I am slightly worried about our state budget.  I'm sure many states will be facing budget challenges because of the pandemic but our state gets a huge chunk of its funding from gaming and tourism-related activities as well as sales tax; ALL of these things are barely happening now and probably for several months into the future.  eeekkkFinally, here are some ways to earn extra cash in the age of the coronavirus."},

{"title": "Out And About", "date": "Monday, May 11, 2020", "text": "Our city is slowly reopening so with a big \"to do\" list, we set out to get stuff \"to done\" today.First stop was to mail a box of clothes to the SIL and an antenna for her TV (we had an extra antenna and it was cheaper to mail it than ordering one to be delivered to her).  Our local Office Depot is now open so we could actually go in to mail the box which is way better than standing in line at the post office.  This is the first time we have been in a store, other than a grocery store, for two months!  So I had to take a picture...Then we dropped off the SIL's car to get the windows tinted.  It seemed to be business as usual there, no one was wearing masks, and they seemed to be pretty busy at the shop.Next we dropped off some food to one of the cousins, then headed out to lunch for the first time in a couple of months!  We went to the Olive Garden, and while it seemed quieter than usual, probably because in a six table section they were only using two tables to keep people distanced, they were pretty steady.  Although I was excited to go out to lunch, I thought the service was slow and the food was just meh--I think in addition to not wanting to shop much since we started quaranting at home, I don't think I want to eat out much now either, I rather like my own cooking better!Speaking of which, after a quick trip through the 99 cent store which was really quiet too, we went home and made a new recipe that hubby wanted to try.  This recipe is for Filipino Fresh Lumpia which is almost exactly like Chinese mu shu pork (only with this recipe we skipped the meat and made it vegetarian).  It turned out really really yummy and the wrapper that I made from the recipe was exactly like a French crepe so we saved some of the wrappers and I'm going to use them to make strawberry crepes tomorrow."},

{"title": "On the Grocery Front", "date": "Thursday, May 7, 2020", "text": "We walked over to the grocery store today, mostly because they had boxes of blueberries on sale for 25 cents a box instead of the usual $2.99 (a special if you use their app; each week the app features one ridiculously low-priced item, probably to get people in the store).  We were also able to pick up pork ribs for $1.97 a pound (I've tried to get hubby to go vegan without much luck!) and I was surprised that they even had such low-priced meat in stock because all I have been hearing on the news lately is about meat shortages.  A few of their meat shelves were looking pretty sparse......and this is something I have never seen before, our grocery store selling number 10 cans of stuff.  I'm guessing with schools and restaurants closed, the distributor needed somewhere to sell these so they are trying to sell them through grocery stores."},

{"title": "To Reopen or Not Reopen?", "date": "Thursday, April 16, 2020", "text": "The roses are from our neighbor's beautiful rose garden.  I usually take photos every time we walk by since everything looks so pretty!  As far as the hubby and I, we are just hanging out at home, doing our daily walks, doing little clean up/home improvement projects, entertaining ourselves online, etc.For us, this isn't such a terrible situation financially, but for many people and all governments (local, state, and federal), the discussion has turned from how to survive lockdown to when can we re-open because we need the money.  Our mayor thinks our governor has lost his mind for keeping us on lockdown so long, our unemployment rate has increased an unheard of 2125%, and the small business stimulus program just ran out of money.So while the hubby and I are fine, financially speaking, for now, our income is totally derived from tax payers (Social Security and military pension) which would be a concern if this goes on long enough.  The longer the lockdown goes on, the more people will be negatively impacted, jobs could be lost and never come back, without workers governments won't be receiving any tax money, and individuals are now hitting up food banks in droves but what happens when the food banks run out of food and more and more people are going hungry?  I totally see why everything should reopen because our entire economic system has been torpedoed, but on the other hand, cutting everyone loose to return to their regular lives with no way to mitigate the virus has it's down side as well (like death).It will be interesting to see how we come out of the coronavrius quarantine, especially my city of Las Vegas which basically thrives on the opposite of social distancing.  People coming together for conferences and conventions, going to nightclubs and packed restaurants, gambling in tightly packed spaces with people from all over the world, standing cheek-by-jowl with people at popular tourist attractions...I think it may be a long road to recovery for my city.  Some of the hardest hit areas aren't even looking at reopening for another month or so but others are looking at reopening as soon as possible.These are scary turbulent times, economically, politically, and financially!"},

{"title": "Prepping for the Next Pandemic", "date": "Tuesday, April 14, 2020", "text": "Even though we are still in lockdown, our businesses and politicians are looking at opening up our city as soon as possible.  Not only does it take money to keep even the most minimal bills for a casino paid, the revenue from taxes on gambling and hotels is what funds the biggest part of Nevada's government.  Needless to say, people don't want this situation to drag on forever. So while (hopefully) we avoid the coronavirus this time around, I am pretty sure it will come back again (since it is a novel virus, it will pretty much go through all of the population eventually much like the flu).  And while this time we were blindsided by the pandemic and given only a few days warning that everything was shutting down, I definitely want to be better prepared for the next time something like this happens.  Here is what I am doing/starting to do/planning to do in order to be better prepared for the next disaster:Get bidets for our toilets (probably a better long-term option than toilet paper and the people I know who have these swear by them)Stock up on a reasonable amount of toilet paper (I probably won't give up this luxury all together and as soon as Costco has more in stock I am going to get several big packages of it)Buy a freezer and fill it with food (we used to have a freezer when we had all of the kids in the house but with just the to of us, we decided we didn't need one.  I think we may buy a small freezer when they are back in stock)Cook at home more often, even when all of the restaurants open back up (this is also a good way to rotate a lot of stockpiled food)Do an entire home inventory of consumables and stock up on all of the items on my list (I already made the list and now as we shop I try to buy a few extra of each item which range from toothpaste to hair color to scouring powder, etc)Get all of our legal stuff done ASAP (I need to renew my driver's license and do the annual registration for our car; I'm glad I already got my passport renewed instead of putting it off)Stock up on hubby's prescriptions and look at all options for renewing them (we were literally given a few days notice that his access to free prescriptions would be suspended until further notice; we need to plan better in case this happens again)Make hubby's doctor appointment as soon as possible (currently only emergencies are being seen at our military hospital so as soon as he can get a regular appointment with his doctor we will do this in case another shut down happens again)Improve my health (I really need to improve my diet but we have been exercising every day so that's a good thing)Completely stock our pantry and refrigerator (we are pretty good about this but from now on I will feel better with at least three of each item instead of shopping when we have half an item left)Plant a garden, even a small one (we actually have two growing seasons in Las Vegas, in the spring and fall, so I should take advantage of this and plant at least a few things like greens and tomatoes)Get out of debt ASAP (the car should be paid off soon and next up will be the credit card)Put money in savings every month (we are kind of good at this but as soon as we are completely out of debt we can start saving even more)Do all of our home maintenance projects (we need a new AC system, probably sooner rather than later, and there are several other projects we would like to tackle; these things are better done before another shut down happens)Review and restock our first aid kits (fortunately we haven't been really sick during this pandemic but if it happens again I want to be prepared.  The first few weeks of this current lockdown we couldn't find any sort of medications in the stores!)Do car maintenance (we haven't really drove the car much lately but I like to get the oil changed and basic maintenance done regularly; we will do these things as soon as things get back to normal)Develop multiple sources of work-from-home income (everything is kind of at a standstill right now but any trickle of income is a good thing; I need to work on this!)Get some things for home entertainment (we have been making due OK but it would be nice to have a sewing machine, some jigsaw puzzles, and I would also like to learn to play the violin so I will be looking for all of these things at the Goodwill when it reopens)Get some emergency evacuation gear (watching things in the south with tornadoes all over the place reminds me that even though we don't have many natural disasters here, we should still have some emergency evacuation gear like sleeping bags, a tent, etc)Buy more house clothes (that's literally almost all we have been wearing for a month so as soon as the Goodwill opens, I will be looking for more of this type of clothing)Get a better water filter system (our tap water is awful and as soon as the quarantine hit, we couldn't find a single water filter system in the stores.  I've heard that whole-house RO systems are the best so I will look into this)Get some hair clippers (again, as the lockdown drags on, everyone's hair is getting long and we can't find a single hair clipper to buy when there are usually several cheap sets at Ross and TJ Maxx.  We will definitely be buying one of these when they come available)Pick up hard to find items as they become available (although we have hand sanitizer and bleach and a few masks, apparently it would be a good idea to have even more of these items on hand in case of emergency so when they come available again, I will definitely pick some more up)Learn some new skills (soap making, canning, sewing...all of those old fashioned skills that I haven't done since my grandmother was alive could really come in handy in an emergency so I need to brush up on all of these skills)Get our vaccines (I haven't got a tetanus shot, flu shot, etc. in years so I probably should get these and any other vaccines that I need before the next disaster hits)Keep up connections with family and friends (ever since the lockdown we seem to be more connected with family and friends via calls, texting, FB messenger, Zoom, etc. than we ever were before.  We definitely want to continue this)So that's my not-so-short to do list but I really want to make an effort to be better prepared for any kind of disaster that happens in the future!"},

{"title": "10 Ways to Help Out During the Pandemic", "date": "Friday, March 27, 2020", "text": "It seems so far people (besides the hoarders) are coming together to help each other out during the pandemic in our city.  Lots of people are donating things and volunteering to help where needed which is always good to see!  Here are 10 ways people can help others during this difficult time.Donate blood.  There is a nation-wide shortage of blood because people who usually donate blood are staying home and staying away from other people.  I believe the blood donation places are taking special precautions to ensure only one person comes in at a time to donate blood to avoid spreading the virus.If you have spare PPEs (disposable gloves, gowns, masks, face shields, etc) consider donating them to a local hospital, nursing home, EMS service, law enforcement organization, etc.  All of these people who must deal with sick people on a daily basis are scrambling to find these critical items to protect themselves.Donate food and supplies if you have extra.  Many of our local non-profits, from homeless shelters to food banks to animal shelters, etc. have put out a call for donated food and hygiene items so that they can use them for the people and pets they take care of.  If we can't buy stuff in our regular stores, you can bet these people are having an even harder time getting stuff they need.Donate money to local non-profits.  Places like food banks can buy a lot more food through their channels with money than what we can buy in a regular store with the same amount of money.Check on older friends and relatives regularly, especially if they live alone.  At least I have the hubby to talk to and keep me entertained, I imagine it would be super isolating and lonely if a single person is staying in their home 24/7 by themself.  We call/text/Facetime all of our older relatives a few times a week just to say hi and check in with them.If you are a credentialed or retired medical professional, consider volunteering in a local hospital.  Some hospitals in particularly hard-hit areas are calling for volunteers wherever they can find them.  Of course you would need to measure the risk/reward as most retirees are also in the high risk category for complications from the coronavirus.Consider helping out first responders (doctors, nurses, nursing home workers, etc) as you can.  This can range from babysitting for their kids to cooking them meals to ordering pizza to be delivered to the ER of your local hospital.  Again, you need to measure the risk/reward if, for example, you decide to watch someone else's kids...they are germy little creatures!Answer the call to volunteer in your community.  Our CERT Team has sent out a call for volunteers as have the local meal programs and homeless outreach programs.  Again, the risk/reward for helping out with the public is your call.If you have skills, consider using them to help out the cause.  Some people are sewing face masks to donate and this guy even invented a new ventilator to help.Plant a victory garden.  If you have the time and space to grow your own garden, this is both a great way to exercise as well as produce food for yourself, your friends, and family."},
{"title": "We Ventured Out Today", "date": "Thursday, March 26, 2020", "text": "It's been more than a week since we left our house so this morning we decided to venture out.  Our first stop was to deliver some banana bread to an elderly cousin who lives alone.  I left it in a bag hanging on her door and texted her to go out and get it so we wouldn't pass on any germs we may have (although I think my head cold issue is allergies since I took an allergy pill before we left the house and all of my symptoms went away...I just didn't want to look infectious in public!).Then we drove by Baskin Robbins just to see if they were open and they were!  I guess ice cream is an essential service so I picked up a Blast.  They had taken all of the seating out so it was take-away only.  There was no one else in the store and I used my card to buy the drink so there was no exchange of germs (color me paranoid now!).  This is actually a full-sized drink but it looks weirdly small from the angle I photographed it.Our next stop was Walmart but it looked like a whole lot of people going in and out of the store so we skipped it and went next door to Sam's Club which was amazingly empty of people.  We had never seen so few people at this Sam's Club so it was a really nice shopping experience.  They had plenty of water and plenty of bleach, no toilet paper, no hand sanitizer, and no rice but they had industrial-strength sanitizer which you add to water in a spray bottle so we got a bottle of this (it makes 128 gallons so it should last the rest of our lifetimes, plus this is better than hubby tracking bleach water everywhere!). There was an odd mix of people, most wore no mask or gloves (hubby and I just sanitized our hands before and after going into the store and tried not to touch our faces), some wore masks, some wrapped scarves around their faces, some wore rubber gloves, and a few were trying to steer their carts with their elbows so they wouldn't actually touch the cart; everyone looked like they were trying to keep their distance from other people.  Then we went to the Asian store and nearly everyone was wearing masks and again, there weren't that many people there.  We picked up a few things but they didn't have rice, the lady said you had to get there early in the morning and they give people a ticket to buy one bag of rice each.  Fortunately we still have plenty of rice so that isn't an issue yet.  In both stores I asked why they weren't very busy and both said that the past few weeks they had been swamped but this week it had really slowed down.On a side note, of the people I saw wearing masks, many were not wearing them correctly.  The mask must cover both your nose and mouth, not just your mouth, and be stuck to your face as tightly as possible to be effective.  Also, don't touch the mask then touch your face!"},
{"title": "10 Things I've Learned from the Pandemic So Far", "date": "Wednesday, March 25, 2020", "text": "What a difference a couple of weeks make!  Two weeks ago we were going to buffets, hubby was bowling with his leagues and playing poker, my walking group was planning our spring walks, and we were going about town without a care in the world.  Fast forward two tumultuous weeks and...well there have been a lot of lessons learned!It is so so so important to be totally debt free.  Many people are buried under debt on a normal day but the sudden transition from \"party town\" Vegas where everyone was employed to barely anyone is working Vegas was so swift that people are freaking out over how they will pay not only their regular bills like rent and utilities but how to pay their credit card, car, and other debts (note that when we went out for a drive a few days ago we noticed that the business with the most customers was the payday loan place!).It is equally so so so important to have an emergency fund, the bigger the better.  With the sudden closure of, well, nearly everywhere around the world, people didn't have time to save money or even prepare for such a life-changing event that practically happened over night.  Many people online were talking about not having enough money to even go buy extra diapers for their babies when all of this started.  Hopefully this disaster inspires everyone to live below their means and save up some money in case such a crisis happens again.The government might help you...eventually.  Again, the shutdown was done so quickly, that many of the \"normal\" systems that people depend on in a crisis were themselves in crisis mode.  People who got laid off from their jobs had to deal with applying for unemployment only online instead of having an office to go to for help and then when they tried to apply online or over the phone, both systems were crashing so much they were virtually impossible to use.  Now the politicians are talking about stimulus check which might show up sometime in May which begs the question, how do people who are hungry now pay for food?  People really do need to be able to depend on themselves first and foremost because the government may not be very helpful for a while (or ever, apparently, in the case of small businesses).I will probably never pass up a sale again.  Our stores have lots of great sales and we get reams of coupons in our junk mail but we are usually pretty minimalistic and only buy what we need (we do stock up on food and some toiletries because we have guests so often) but now I am thinking about all of the super cheap stuff we could have stockpiled that we could be donating to help other people in tough times like this.Having multiple streams of income is a good thing.  Currently I don't have multiple streams of income and hubby pays all of the bills (which he can fortunately easily afford, I realize we are in a very good financial position comparatively).  I was looking forward to working at the WSOP and banking the $5k to $6k I would earn there but it looks like the event may not even go this year so I can't put all of my eggs/expectations in one basket.We need some at-home hobbies.  We are usually gone from morning to early evening, almost every day.  We don't really have at-home hobbies but as we have learned from being at home, 24/7, for days on end, I need to get some jigsaw puzzles, coloring books, maybe a sewing machine...stuff to keep me busy while at home.  Hubby was so bored today he scrubbed and degreased the kitchen--even going so far as cleaning each individual window blind!  See photo above.We need to go through our emergency supplies more regularly.  I went through our first aid kit after all of this started and the aspirin we had in the kit expired in 2013(!).  Fortunately we had a full bottle of unexpired Tylenol (the fever reducer of choice due to warnings not to use ibuprofen if you might have coronavirus) but it's always good to have a comprehensive emergency kit that is up to date.When a crisis hits, you need to get a grip and not panic.  People have (rightly) been freaked out over the sudden and deadly pandemic for several reasons.  Job loss, suddenly their kids had no school for the rest of the year, maybe they had no money saved, maybe they only had one roll of toilet paper left when they saw the panic buying stories on the news, etc.  And then there was all of the misinformation spread through social media plus the 24/7 news which was pretty much ALL bad news...that's a lot of stuff that can be both physically and psychologically overwhelming when it is hitting you non-stop.  Being prepared goes a long way towards keeping the panic down as does fact-checking anything you hear in the media.Being able to cook is a good thing!  I am not a great cook but I love to bake.  Hubby is a good cook but he hasn't really cooked in ages.  Fortunately we have lots of ingredients that we can use to whip up meals every day and we have time for me to try out new recipes.  Some people never cook at all and tend to eat out daily, especially in my city where there are so many amazing restaurants.  Again, people didn't even have time to prepare and practice cooking and/or stock up their pantry (many didn't even know what to include in their pantry) so having basic life skills, and teach your kids things like how to cook, are really important skills to have.We learned to make some changes and adjust to the current circumstances.  We always drink bottled water but with bottled water difficult to find, we have mostly switched to tap water which we boil (it tastes a bit better after it is boiled than when it comes out of the tap) and are saving our bottled water for a true emergency.  We are cutting down on food waste drastically and use up all of our leftovers, we regularly check up on our elderly relatives now that they are stuck at home and have no social outlets...basically every day provides new learning experiences which are both a challenge as well as an opportunity to learn and experience something new."},
{"title": "A Week Without People", "date": "Tuesday, March 24, 2020", "text": "It's been a whole week since we have interacted with anyone!  I think this is the first time that has ever happened but hubby and I are still hanging out at home hoping to get over our illnesses (cold? flu? allergies?) and avoid catching anything from other people.  As you can see we are critically low on M & Ms which isn't good.  I go tired of looking at my shaggy self so hubby trimmed my hair and I colored it and I feel much better about that even though, as I said, no one will see it!  We still have plenty of food and supplies but life is pretty boring compared to our usual 'always on the go' lifestyle.  I also made a \"whole-house inventory list\" of every single consumable item we use from shampoo to garam masala so that when everything resolves we will fully stock up on every single item we normally use (being fully prepared to hole up at home for months on end without needing to be out in stores fighting over soap and toilet paper suddenly has a whole new appeal!).  I hope you and your are staying safe and healthy at home!"},

{"title": "10 Things We Aren't Using During Quarantine", "date": "Sunday, March 22, 2020", "text": "No baking pictures today since I didn't bake anything.  I figure we have enough baked goods to last a week or more, however most of the stuff I baked went into the freezer to eat later.  One thing I was thinking about today was all of the things we are NOT using/spending money on during the quarantine...Makeup.  I haven't put on makeup in more than a week!  I guess in a disaster, the need for beauty and makeup goes out the window.Clothes.  I mean I wear clothes, house clothes like sweatpants and t shirts, and when we go for a walk I just throw on a sweatshirt and off we go.  Needless to say, the neighbors have all seen my house clothes every morning when I am working in the yard but there has been absolutely no need to put on regular clothes for more than a week!Gasoline.  Our car has only left the garage once in the past week and that was to take a quick drive to the Strip and see how things were looking there.  Many people have been going to the scenic areas to enjoy the outdoors and \"distance\" themselves, however these places are so crammed full of people they have had to close for people's safety.Bottled water.  While people were freaking out and buying as much bottled water as they could, we decided to switch to tap water in order to save our bottled water for a real emergency.  We tend to boil it then flavor it by making tea or adding just a bit of juice to change the flavor of the water.  The water in Las Vegas is just OK but I still think bottled water tastes better.No Baskin Robbin Blast or Starbucks frappuccinos.  While I do (did?) have what one might call an addiction to yummy coffee drinks, I haven't had any for more than a week.  It isn't worth the health risk to go to a restaurant every day just to get a coffee fix. The next time we go get groceries, however, I will probably get the ice cream and stuff to make my own coffee beverage treats.Portable electronics.  Before the pandemic hit, I was obsessively checking out reviews and updates on the latest cell phones and tablets and other portable electronics.  I use these items every day when we are out and about as I usually hang out on the free wifi while hubby is playing poker.  Since we are house-bound, I have all I need with my laptop and TV so any other electronics purchases will wait until sometime after this disaster passes.Spending money on random stuff.  We don't usually buy a lot of stuff but over the course of a week we might hit up the grocery store, the dollar store, the Goodwill, Costco, Sam's Club, maybe Walmart, a couple restaurants, etc.  Since we have been housebound, we haven't spent a penny.  There is nothing we really need so I haven't ordered anything on Amazon either.  Staying home is a great way to save money.Traveling anywhere.  Before the pandemic we had had plans to go on a dinner cruise then drive up to Reno, go to a family reunion in Washington, and the SIL was still trying to get us to make a quick trip to Connecticut.  We also wanted to visit several state parks as well as a few national parks.  Since everything came to a screeching halt, we decided not to do any of these things until things get back to normal.Our regular activities have come to a halt (as did spending on these activities).  Hubby's bowling leagues are cancelled, all of the poker rooms he plays at have been shut down, my walking club has cancelled all activities until further notice as have community events like the CERT exercise I was supposed to participate in.Finally, not us, but friends and family have made some major changes due to the pandemic: a friend spent several thousand dollars on a 70th birthday party for her husband which we would have attended next week (she cancelled it and will hold the party on his 71st birthday), the SIL and her husband were going to buy a house next month when his job relocates the BIL but that probably won't happen (the job is suddenly on hold so they don't want to buy a house in a location he may not even end up working in), the cousins were going to take their annual spring cruise but cancelled when people started being quarantined on cruise ships, and another set of cousins usually go to Asia for six months each spring but they cancelled their trip as well because of both the possibility of catching the virus as well as the possibility of not being able to get back into the US when they wanted to return.On the one hand, being quarantined saves a lot of money, on the other hand, not having all of the usual economic activity that most everyone participates in on a daily basis has brought our overall economy to a screeching halt--not good for employees, not good for businesses, not good for anyone really as economics are a cycle and when there is a glitch in that cycle, everyone is eventually impacted."},
{"title": "10 Things From Today", "date": "Saturday, March 21, 2020", "text": "In no particular order...I made banana bread today.  Hubby even helped me bake which tells you hubby is bored silly!We went for a two mile walk and went over by a strip mall.  Target was open as was World Market, GNC, Dollar Store, PetCo, Big Lots, and several other stores.  There were people everywhere and they didn't seem to be worried to be near each other  :/We STILL aren't going into any stores or getting close to anyone even when we are walking.  I don't want people to catch my germs and I certainly don't want to catch theirs.Hubby likes to watch Pluto TV on his cell phone (it's a free app for free TV), he particularly likes the poker channel so when I showed him how to mirror his phone on our big TV he was quite happy not to have to squint to watch his poker shows.FYI--income tax filing has been moved from April 15th to July 15th so hopefully that helps some people out.Did you know that national parks are free during the coronavirus outbreak?Our utility bills--gas, water, electricity, etc--are going to be high.  With us staying home 24/7 we are using a lot more utilities than we usually do.Our DMV put out a notice that it will extend the expiration dates on our licenses, car registrations, etc.  Thank goodness, my license is going to expire in a few weeks!The census is also going to be delayed for a couple of weeks.  I already filled out our census online but I didn't know how the people who go door-to-door to collect census information were going to fair during the pandemic.We had shrimp tacos for dinner last night (with not much to do, cooking and baking has kind of become our entertainment!)"},

{"title": "Happy St Patrick's Day!", "date": "Tuesday, March 17, 2020", "text": "Yep, I had to check the calendar but it is indeed St Patrick's Day.  This is usually a pretty big holiday in Las Vegas but everyone seems to be staying away from crowds and several casinos are closing their doors today due to the pandemic so it will be a very low-key holiday this year.  In today's news...I went to the ER last night.  My kidneys were killing me but I put off going because it didn't seem that bad and I was hoping the issue would resolve but after a few days, it didn't seem to be getting better.  After a full work-up, absolutely nothing was wrong with me.  Note that being pre-menopausal SUCKS.  Your body feels like it is breaking down every single day, there are at least a hundred different symptoms, and at the end of the day, you might feel like death but your body is actually fine.  ayayayWhile I was at the ER my friend texted me.  We seem to have a psychic connection because whenever something is happening with me, she seems to know, and whenever something is happening with her I have a sudden strong urge to call her and make sure everything is all right.  So I gave her a quick run down of what was happening and she said GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.  Apparently you don't want to be in a hospital during a pandemic unless you are actually dying because staff is overworked, PPEs seemed to be in short supply, and they said they were overrun with possible coronavirus patients (which was weird because there was not a single person in the waiting room, my doctor said they quarantine these patients the minute they walk in the door so they don't infect others).  The best place to be during a pandemic is NOT around sick people!Speaking of sick people, hubby came down with something this morning.  Fever, sore throat, coughing...generally not feeling well at all.  After listening to the desk guy in the ER answering dozens and dozens of calls last night from people apparently worried they have COVID-19 or asking if they could get tested for the virus, I gathered that people are supposed to stay home and treat themselves like they would if they have the flu and not go to the ER unless they are seriously ill (and call an ambulance if they have difficulty breathing).  So I am treating hubby like he has the flu with rest, fluids, soup, Tylenol, etc.  Hopefully he just gets a mild case of whatever it is he has :(In random  news: this guy started a roof-top exercise class for people quarantined to their apartments, and here are 2780+ free e-books which will keep you entertained while home-bound, here are some free online classes to keep your home-bound kids entertained and learning while school is closed, and here is a list of even more online learning opportunities.  These are soothing animal webcams to keep you entertained, and this is Fiona the hippo who is really cute.'Finally, this blogger is starting a challenge to \"knock something out every day.\"  This sounds like a wonderful opportunity to get things done that you have been putting off!"},
{"title": "What a Difference a Day Makes", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2020", "text": "So yesterday morning when I wrote my blog post, we had decided to stay away from the casinos for a while and kind of self-quarantine ourselves except for going out to get food.  By yesterday evening, things had changed significantly.  All of our schools are closed (that's 300,000 kids wandering around Vegas now!), and half of the casinos on the Strip have now closed (I think it's only a matter of time before ALL of the casinos close).  Our military base is closed to everyone except mission-essential personnel, all events are cancelled, and many places around our city have shut down like the library system and all senior centers.  This is the first time ever that Las Vegas has essentially shut down and there appears to be no end in sight for these closures.  Hubby is already going stir crazy (he loves to be out and about, playing poker with his poker buddies or bowling with his leagues or even just wandering around the Dollar Store looking at everything).  When I told him the UK is considering quarantining the elderly for four months...needless to say he wasn't happy about that idea.  So I guess the situation is what it is.  We will hang out at home, I may try ordering food from Sprouts or Amazon Fresh instead of going to the stores, and we will just wait and see what happens.  If you are staying home for the time being, here are some interesting ways to pass the time..."},
{"title": "The Good and the Bad", "date": "Sunday, March 15, 2020", "text": "I'll start with the bad news...the people in our city have lost their minds.  We stayed home today but decided to walk to our nearest grocery store to see how things were going (it's good exercise and it was a nice sunny day).  We were pretty stunned to see that while last week our grocery store was fully stocked and customers were shopping normally, today it looked like a war zone.  Shelves were empty, it looked like every employee they had was working furiously to both stock shelves and check out customers, and there was a fight while we were there!  We live in a nice neighborhood so needless to say this was pretty shocking (on the other side of town in the 'hood nothing surprises me but this was surprising).  As these guys were fighting a bunch of people pulled out their phones to record it (???) and when they called for security a bunch of employees came running (we never have actual security guards at this store like they do in other neighborhoods so their \"security\" people were the old and small-statured regular employees who seriously don't get paid enough to deal with this.  When I checked out with the few items I bought the cashier said it was the second fight they had had there today.  People have lost their minds! We also made the national news again (when Vegas makes the national news, it is seldom for anything good).On to the good stuff...We have a few more lemons left on our tree...The apricot tree, while half dead, is blossoming with future apricots on half of it...We saw some nice scenery while walking today...I made pancakes for breakfast...And I was able to weed part of the yard this morning (I do it in sections, a couple times a year, as my back can only take so much bending over)...Hopefully this whole pandemic thing passes soon!"},
{"title": "10 Things from This Weekend", "date": "Saturday, March 14, 2020", "text": "It's pretty quiet around here.  I stayed home but hubby decided to go play poker and apparently the poker room was pretty busy even though nearly every single player there is in the high risk group...eeekkk.  It's been generally crazy around here (I think, I only know what I read online because we are well and truly stocked and avoid the stores like the plague!) and many people are being laid off their jobs since a big part of the workforce deals directly with the pubic and many events have been cancelled causing a ripple effect through all of Las Vegas.  Here's some other things from this weekend...Las Vegas made the national news.Here is a '100 free and useful software' list for students.  Which might be helpful if your students are at home for weeks on end.  If you are stuck at home, here are 12 museums from around the world that you can visit virtually.Here are 50 examples of how the coronavirus is affecting people's lives.And here are all of the big events closed by the coronavirus (I would have thought the sports books would have had a collective aneurysm when they cancelled March Madness, that's more than a multi billion dollar impact on Las Vegas alone!).There are rumors that the World Series of Poker may be cancelled this year (so many events are cancelled now in Las Vegas).  Obviously it would be a good thing for public health but I would be really disappointed because I love working this event!Our family has also been affected by the virus in various ways.  One SIL travels a lot but she has cancelled all of her tickets for the time being and may end up staying with us until this blows over, several family members in Connecticut work in the casinos there and all have been laid off until further notices and most of the grandkids are staying home as their schools have all been closed until further notice.On a happier note, today is Pi Day!  Here are a bunch of deals to celebrate the holiday.Also on a happier note, when I need happier news than what I can find from most media outlets, I check out this subreddit.Hopefully we will keep seeing resources come up to help people impacted by the coronavirus.  The SBA has a small business program to provide disaster assistance, the USDA is helping out with free meals for kids whose schools were closed, and many utility companies will halt shut offs during the pandemic."},
{"title": "Coronavirus Vegas Style", "date": "Wednesday, March 11, 2020", "text": "So it seems like the coronavirus is getting pretty serious (or else I am reading too much social media, but with the reach of reddit, we get real-time, \"boots on the ground\" updates from people who are actually quarantined for two weeks or more whether they are in Italy or on a cruise ship...scary stuff!).  Here's what's happening in Vegas...We went to the Asian store and they don't have rice and don't know when they will get more.  We did see big bags of sweet rice which made me wonder if people who don't usually eat rice know the difference between the two (sweet rice is for desserts, not regular eating).One of our major casino chains has closed all of their buffets until further notice.Some of our local businesses are having employees work at home and are limiting access to their offices.There have been A LOT of events canceled in Las Vegas including the NAB and other conferences (I'm really worried about how employees who staff these events will get by without work/paychecks/benefits/etc).Many restaurants in Las Vegas, especially Asian restaurants, are pretty hard hit by the virus.  Hubby and I went to a buffet a couple days ago and there was probably a quarter of the people eating there that would normally be.I got hired for WSOP again which I am really looking forward to working at...I just hope the event doesn't get cancelled!We went to the grocery store today and their ad flyer had cases of water on sale (!).  Of course they were out of water and when I asked why they would put it on sale during this time the lady said the ads are created months in advance so the sale price is actually less than what the store is currently paying to buy the water wholesale plus their supplier can't even keep up with demand.  Yikes.Meanwhile hubby and I are fine and while I worry more about him getting the virus because he is in a high risk group, so far he won't give up his bowling leagues or poker playing.  And while I would be perfectly fine being quarantined to home for a couple of weeks, I think he would go stir crazy!"},

{"title": "Substitute This for That", "date": "Tuesday, March 3, 2020", "text": "I spent most of my childhood growing up on a farm with my grandparents.  They were not rich by any stretch of the imagination and most of the things they did was dictated by having grown up during the Great Depression.  There are A LOT of things that people are running out and buying right now that my grandparents (and many people around the world today) would have never even considered buying.  Here's how to substitute common items for things that you would otherwise think you had to buy to survive the coronavirus or any other disaster...Instead of kleenex, use a handkerchief.  It saves paper, saves money, and many people around the world still use hankies instead of spending exorbitant amounts of money on paper to blow their nose into.Instead of paper towels, use rags.  This is what everyone used up until paper towels came into common use.Instead of Clorox wipes and similar products, use rags soaked in water with a little bleach in it.Baking substitutes.  Whether there has been a run on a necessary ingredient at the grocery store or you run out of an item and don't want to trek to the store to get more--but you still want to bake your cake--there are several things you can use to substitute for all kinds of baking supplies (examples here, here, and here).Instead of toilet paper, there are several other things you can use (which about 70% of the world uses on a daily basis because toilet paper is expensive when you are poor).Instead of disposable items, use more durable alternatives.  Basically anything that is meant to be thrown away after one use has a non-disposable alternative.  Nalgene water bottles, titanium eating utensils, fabric or nylon shopping bags, rechargeable batteries, reusable coffee filters, using a tea ball instead of a tea bag...anytime you go to throw away something, think of what could be substituted for the item that you would only need to buy once.Use cloth diapers instead of disposable diapers.  Yes it's more hassle but it is also much cheaper and you won't panic if suddenly every store in your town is out of plastic diapers.Instead of buying dozens of household products like laundry soap and cosmetics, having a few general purpose items on hand will allow you to make many of the products yourself that you would otherwise pay top dollar for at the store.Did you know that instead of throwing your vegetable scraps into the garbage bin or compost pile you can regrow many of them and create your own, unending, mini garden?I try to eat vegan as much as possible and in doing so, I've needed to find substitutions for using animal products when cooking.  Here are a bunch of substitution ideas for commonly used foods.Before you run out to the store to buy an item (or if the shelves are bare due to panic buying) consider alternative substitutions for what you need (the internet is full of clever ideas to both save money and re-purpose items around your home).Homemade cold and flu remedies can be an alternative to store-bought items.  There are a bunch of caveats to this of course...never try to make prescription medicine at home, if you are really sick go to the doctor immediately, don't use vet medicines like fish mox unless it really is the end of the world and you have no other alternative, and strive to always have the most common first aid items on hand (Tylenol, ibuprofen, etc).Sometimes when there is a shortage of a certain food, you just have to go without.  There have frequently been times when there was no lettuce in the stores, tomato shortages, etc.  Making meals without a few common items isn't that difficult to do, plus you can often substitute some foods for other foods without a great difference in taste.I'm guessing that all of this panic buying will blow over soon but until then, then internet is full of useful and interesting alternatives for nearly everything that you think is a necessity in your life."},
{"title": "I Can Confirm That the Shelves Are Bare...Kind Of", "date": "Monday, March 2, 2020", "text": "Hubby and I stopped by Walmart today when we were out and about just to see if people were really panic buying like we saw on the news.  Turns out that the answer is yes, yes they are...That last picture was of the bottled water section that was pretty much empty.  But again, this is Walmart and many of their sections are pretty sparse looking even on a good day.  On the other hand, we also stopped by our local Albertsons and all seemed to be well (I asked the checker why they weren't sold out of everything and she said her manager had been in the business for years and knew what happened when people started panic buying stuff so he put in double orders for the past couple week just to have enough stock on hand...smart manager!)."},
{"title": "15 Items I am NOT Stockpiling", "date": "Sunday, March 1, 2020", "text": "I think a lot of people have lost their minds over this coronavirus thing.  They are panic buying everything they can get their hands on and scaring the crap out of each other in online message boards.  Here are 15 things I am not panic buying (unlike the general population or so it seems...):N95/face masks.  Unless you are using PPEs like they do in a Level 4 biohazard lab, it doesn't really make sense to use masks at all.  First of all, you could have been infected a week or so ago before you started wearing the masks and second of all, even if you wear a mask religiously, your spouse or kids could pick up the virus and bring it home and infect you.  I think using a mask gives people a false sense of security and the vast majority of people don't use them properly anyway.Bottled water.  We keep a small supply of bottled water on hand, mostly because we live in a desert and if the water from the tap stops for some reason, it's a good idea to have some water on hand for an emergency.  Also our tap water here tastes truly terrible.  On the other hand, paying top dollar because panic buyers have jacked up the price of bottled is unnecessary since if we do get sick, our tap water is still going to work, it isn't like we will have no water available at all.Bags of rice.  For some reason everyone is talking about stockpiling rice.  While we do have rice on hand (hubby likes rice for every meal so we buy it by the 50 pound bag), again, if the price skyrockets because people are artificially running up the price, we will just switch to pasta or bread (I've got lots of flour and yeast on hand to make my own bread if needed).Toilet paper.  We have a couple of big packages of Costco toilet paper on hand which we buy every couple months when we go to Costco but running out to strip the shelves bare of toilet paper is pretty unnecessary.  Stores are still going to be open and there is no reason to think that toilet paper will never be available again.  Also, 70% of the world's population doesn't use toilet paper and they still get by just fine.Antibacterial wipes and cleaners.  I never use these popular wipes and cleaners because they tend to kill off the good bacteria as well and they aren't good for the environment.  Regular soap works just fine for our needs.Mass amounts of pain relievers/fever reducers/cold medicines.  We always keep a stocked first aid kit with enough Tylenol/Thera Flu/etc to help us out during the normal course of a cold or the flu.  Buying too much of this stuff is a waste of money because it will often expire before we can use it.Spam.  I'm not sure what the deal is with stockpiling Spam but while we do have a few cans of it since hubby will occasionally eat it, that stuff isn't healthy for you in large quantities.Guns and ammo.  Seriously?  We actually have guns and a good amount of ammo because I used to shoot as a hobby, but stockpiling this stuff for a viral illness with a 1% mortality rate that is going to lay people out for a week or so with a flu like illness makes no sense.  I don't think the marauding hordes are going to descend on our small house and try to take away our last bits of rice.Canned goods.  We have a pantry full of canned goods (soup, beans, canned tomatoes, sardines, etc) but we have built this up over many months by buying a few extra cans of stuff when they are on sale.  We prefer to eat fresh over canned food anyway so often these canned good are sent to the Philippines/donated to local food banks/used for last minute bulk cooking for large groups of people like for parties and such.Prescription medications.  Hubby does rely on several medications but he gets three month prescriptions which we just recently picked up so we are set for the next several weeks.  His medications are free through the military pharmacy and I don't foresee these medications having shortages to the point that we would pay top dollar to gather even more of these medications. Treats like candy, alcohol, soda, etc.  Any time you are preparing for the apocalypse, you will be reminded to stockpile treats too but we don't drink alcohol, rarely drink soda, and I can easily make cakes and cookies and other food treats with what's in our pantry.Freeze-dried emergency food.  Apparently people are stockpiling freeze-dried backpacking food (in the case they can't leave their home for months on end?) which caused Mountain House to shut down temporarily.  That's crazy.  This kind of food is super expensive and mostly only tastes good when you've backpacked 20 miles and are really tired and hungry.  Ditto for MREs.50 pound bags of beans.  Another item that was swiftly cleared out at Costco was big bags of dried beans.  We have several one pound bags of a variety of beans and legumes that I use for cooking but there is no way we will eat 50 pounds of pinto beans within the next probably several years.  I am guessing that many people buy this sort of thing when they are in a panic then never actually eat them.Milk, bread, eggs, etc.  People always panic buy these basic items whether before a storm is set to hit or even now because they think others will take all of these items in a buying frenzy.  We don't drink milk (I can make oat milk at home and have dried and canned milk for baking), I can easily bake bread myself, and we have several dozen eggs in the refrigerator from a recent sale (plus we can easily go without eggs if necessary).Gasoline.  Some people are noting that they are stockpiling gasoline but there are several reasons we don't do this.  We have no yard/farm equipment that needs it, we don't plan on driving anywhere very far, there are several kinds of public transit we can take if needed, and stocking extra gasoline in our garage that gets up to 110+ degrees in the summer seems very unsafe.The only thing people are doing when they panic buy large quantities of food and supplies is mess up our just-in-time supply chain and jack up the prices of items ($140 for 60 pounds of rice on Amazon???) which causes other people to panic and run out to do the same thing.  While everyone should be prepared for an emergency, panic buying random stuff is not the way to do it.  If everyone simply added a few extra items to their shopping cart each time they went grocery shopping (on sale and with coupons if possible) it wouldn't cause the retail problems we are now seeing and everyone would end up with several weeks of food supplies to use in an emergency."},
{"title": "A Great Walk and Some Great Sales!", "date": "Saturday, February 29, 2020", "text": "This morning my walking group headed out to do a 12k walk up and down the south section of the Las Vegas Strip.  It was a little overcast but overall a great walk.  Did you know that a lot of Las Vegas locals NEVER go to the Strip?  There's too many tourists and way too much traffic so this is the first time I've seen the Strip in more than six months!  There is always a lot of new things to see on the Strip and it is definitely better to go early in the morning to avoid all of the tourists if you want to do a fast-paced walk. In sale news...Hubby bought me a laptop for a (very) early birthday present.  I wanted a small laptop like my old Dell XPS 13\" that I had a while back.  I found an XPS for $1600(!) at Costco which was on sale for $1200, and while I am generally impatient, I decided to wait and see what else I could find.  A couple weeks later I saw a Samsung Notebook 9 Pro 13\" i7 laptop for $1100 but it wasn't on sale.  A few days later I was checking the Best Buy website and they had the Samsung laptop on sale for $800 so I raced up to get it (the store only had two left!).  Then a couple days later this same laptop was on a Flash Sale at Best Buy for an extra $750 so I took the receipt, not the laptop, to Best Buy and they credited me back the $50 price drop.  Overall I love the laptop and think the price was really good as well.We were at the 99 Cent store a few days ago and they had all kinds of produce on sale.  I picked up a giant 10 pound bag of apples thinking they would probably cost more than the $1.99 it said on a sign on the bin (even though it is the 99 cent store, their prices have been creeping up higher and higher a la Dollar General) but no, for some reason the store was getting rid of apples and at 19 cents a pound I couldn't pass up this great sale.  Needless to say, we are going to be eating apples (and applesauce and apple turnovers and apple pie) for a while.Our local Albertsons grocery store has a super sale on an item or two each week if you use their app.  A couple weeks ago hubby and I each used our apps to get eggs for 12 cents a dozen, hubby's favorite coffee creamer for 75 cents (it's usually around $3 a bottle), and various other items each week at ridiculously low prices.  This week, the super sale on the app was a case of bottled water for 99 cents.  We've noticed some stores looking really low on bottled water (maybe the panic buying because of the coronavirus?) so even though we have plenty of bottled water, we each grabbed an extra case of water just to have on hand.  Finally, Happy Leap Day!  I didn't really know Leap Day was that special--unless you happen to be born on February 29th or something--but apparently it is as there is a huge list of sales and deals you can only get on Leap Day."},

{"title": "Taxes Are Done!", "date": "Sunday, February 2, 2020", "text": "While hubby was busy watching the Super Bowl today, I decided to dive into our taxes.  Our taxes are actually pretty basic these days--no rental properties, no businesses, no huge list of itemized deductions--so I figured it would be pretty easy to do.I took a look at doing the return myself just using the 1040 form on the IRS website but I compared it to last year's submitted 1040 and it looked like there were a few schedules I would need to fill out so I took the easy way out and decided to use an online service...this is where it got a bit complicated.First, I checked the free file section on the IRS website and it looked like I could file online through H & R Block, a service I had used for the past decade or so.  So I jumped into my account, said I wanted to do the free file thing, and when I got to the end of entering all of the info in (like at the very end of the filing part) it said we didn't qualify to file because of our ages (you had to be between 17 and 50 to use this service!?!). I looked at using Taxslayer but it had so many bad reviews I didn't want to risk using that service so back I went to H & R Block which wouldn't let me revert to the paid part :(  The solution?  I deleted my entire H & R Block account, including all of my past years taxes done by them (which I downloaded copies of in case I need them in the future), set up an all new account, entered all of my info once again, and was able to complete the filing, send it off to the IRS, and hopefully within a few weeks, have my refund land in my bank account.  Whew!  I'm glad that's done!"},

{"title": "And the Van is Gone", "date": "Tuesday, January 28, 2020", "text": "Hubby has had his van for 19 years.  He paid cash for it way back when, then treated it like his baby since then.  Over the years he has done repairs as they have been needed, but when the air conditioning went out and the head gasket blew and the shop gave him an estimate of $2500 to fix it (with a book value of about $800 in good working order!) he decided it was time to give it up.  I put an ad for it on Craigslist, my old tried and true place to sell things, and got one response.  Then I put an ad for it on Facebook Marketplace and got more than 20 responses.  We sold it to the first guy who looked at it and came close to our price and off he hauled it!  From now on I will definitely go through FB Marketplace to sell stuff."},
{"title": "A Quick Random Update", "date": "Monday, January 27, 2020", "text": "It's been pretty quiet around here so this is just a quick random update...Sunsets in the desert are amazing as usual (see above!).Social media can be truly awful, whether it is spreading completely untrue information about the coronavirus (so much bad info on social media that could literally kill someone! Yikes!) to, I am assuming, notifying Kobe Bryant's wife that her husband and child were killed in a helicopter crash (I'm guessing she got a social media push notification about the crash before the police could even make a notification because TMZ broke the story immediately after the crash happened...how terrible!).Hubby has finally decided to part with his van.  It is nearly 20 years old, he has had it since it was new, and right now it is sitting in the driveway with a busted head gasket.  It would be $2500 to fix what is wrong with it but it has been problem after problem with it so he finally said to sell it.  I will put it on Craigslist later today and hope he gets a little money out of it.I am currently waiting to: file our taxes (we need a couple of more 1099s which should come in the mail this week), apply for my summer gig at WSOP (they have already posted for dealer and supervisor jobs so my job classification should be posted soon), send another box of stuff to family in the Philippines (there is still a little room in the box which we will finish filling up after this week's trip to the Goodwill), stop doing websites all together (I don't know how to break it to my few remaining clients but I have neither the skill nor desire to learn how to make the sites ADA compliant but it seems the lawsuits are flying these days if sites aren't compliant so I need out of the business all together!).Hubby's birthday is next week (big 71!) but it will be a pretty low-key birthday.  I will bring a Costco cake to bowling and he can celebrate with his bowling buddies.That's about all that is happening around here...it's been nice and quiet, just the way I like it :)"},

{"title": "10 Things I Freeze", "date": "Friday, January 17, 2020", "text": "I think the freezer is one of the best inventions ever.  Due to having freezers, we have come a long way from food shortages and seasonal starvation of the past, and we can safely store food for a long time which is both time and money-saving.  Here are 10 items I always freeze:Pancakes and waffles.  Whenever I make pancakes or waffles for breakfast I always make a double batch and freeze whatever we don't eat.  This makes a super speedy breakfast for days when I don't have time to make pancakes and waffles from scratch and they are quick to heat up in the toaster.Bread.  I like to make bread from scratch but I don't do it often.  Usually we buy bread at Costco and we also hit the day-old-bread sale rack when we go to the local grocery store (see photo above) and buy sale bread (10 sandwich rolls for 99 cents today!).  Since we don't eat bread very quickly, we freeze it then defrost as needed.Fruit in season.  We get lots of great deals on fruit (strawberries, blueberries, apples, bananas, peaches, etc) in season, maybe because we are so close to Mexico and California?  No matter the reason, I tend to buy as much as I can, then clean it and freeze it for future use in smoothies, pies, etc.Steel cut oats.  I love steel cut oats for breakfast but don't have time to cook these every day since, unlike oatmeal, steel cut oats take a long time to cook.  For that reason, I dump an entire bag of steel cut oats into the Instapot, cook it in record time, then put single serving-size containers of the steel cut oats into the freezer.  Heating these up for a quick breakfast takes about a minute and a half in the microwave.Beans.  Beans are another item that take quite a long time to cook so, again, I dump a bag of beans into the Instapot, cook them, then put the beans in serving-sized containers and put them in the freezer to be used in future recipes ranging from soups and chili to hummus and desserts.Filipino food.  Hubby loves Filipino food, of course, since he is Filipino, but making classic Filipino food which usually consists of meats in sauces that are braised for a long time, doesn't make for a quick dinner.  So every time we cook Filipino food, we make extra to put in serving-sized containers in the freezer.  For those nights when I don't feel like cooking, pulling out this sort of \"fancy food\" and reheating it is always a hit.  Note, we also give an assortment of these frozen, single-serving food items to the cousins when they come over to visit which they like to keep in their freezers until they are ready to eat it.Party food.  We go to and host several parties throughout the year and we always tend to cook at least some of the dishes for these parties.  If we find a pork roast really cheap, we will pick it up, throw it in the freezer, then cook it and take it to a party with us.  Ditto lumpia and eggrolls (labor-intensive to make but a favorite at parties), whole chickens, and other items to make food to feed dozens of people.  Note, this really saved us when the daughter decided at the last minute to get married here in Vegas and bring 30 people with her.  Since we ended up cooking most meals for everyone, because we had stockpiled a range of food in the freezer over the past many months, we were able to cook great food but not break the bank by having to shop at the last minute to buy all of the ingredients for what we cooked.Meat and fish.  Hubby is in no way going to be vegan or vegetarian any time soon (much as I would like him to!) because he does like his meat.  So when we buy anything from a roast to a whole chicken to a whole salmon (all on sale of course!), he cuts it up into single-serving portions then freezes these little packets of meat or fish which makes it really easy to add some sort of meat dish to his dinners.Vegetables.  Like fruit, anytime we find vegetables on sale, we will freeze them if at all possible.  Frozen corn, beans, peas, etc. are all great addition to soups, stews, Indian dishes and more.Pies and cakes.  I tend to make something for dessert a few times during the week.  I usually make cakes and brownies in small pans so we eat one portion for dessert then freeze the rest to use for future desserts.  Same with pies which we like to eat for maybe one day but we can't eat an entire pie very fast.Using a freezer is really a great way to preserve food, in bulk, which is bought on sale or made from scratch.  Not only does this save money, but it also cuts down the number of times we need to go to the store and in a pinch, we can unload the freezer and cook for dozens of people at once!"},

{"title": "Why You Should Walk", "date": "Saturday, January 4, 2020", "text": "I come from a long line of people who walked.  My grandmother never drove a car but she would happily get around by walking, often for miles and miles, to visit friends or go to the store.  Her brother walked five miles a day into his 90s, and my great grandfather was a sheepherder who walked with his sheep for miles everyday.  For fun, free, and frugal exercise, nothing beats walking!  Here's some reasons why you should walk...Walking is free!  No need for an expensive gym membership, just put on your shoes and head out for a stroll.Walking has a lot of great health benefits.Walking can be a solo or social activity (I like walking by myself as well as joining my walking club every other week for group walks).There are so many walking clubs and organizations!You can walk outside in urban, suburban, or rural places or you can walk inside on either a treadmill, around you local mall, or my default when it gets to be 110 degrees outside--in our local casinos.The only gear you really need is a good, not necessarily expensive, pair of shoes (unlike golf or equestrian or boating sports which cost an arm and a leg when it comes to gear).You can have great conversations while walking (I've yet to see marathon runners have good conversations while they huff and puff up and down hills).  On our group walk today we talked about genealogy, bird watching, health and nutrition, aging, traveling in Europe, and a bunch of other things...our walking club members are endlessly fascinating!You see things when walking that you don't notice when you drive (I walked down a road a few days ago that we drive down often but never noticed that one house has a tiny home in its back yard--interesting!).It can be faster to walk than drive!  Where we live, traffic is getting so bad (lots of traffic, not many traffic lights yet) that it can be faster to walk to the store than drive since you have to wait so long to get through busy intersections).People are friendlier when walking.  For some reason when people get into their cars here, they turn into raving lunatics but when you are walking along the trails in our city, people are relaxed and friendly, often saying \"hi\" or commenting on the weather, the dog someone is walking, etc.There are all kinds of walking.  From competitive race walking to long-distance hiking, to short 5k/10k club walks to mall walking to crazy ultra long distance challenges."},

replace these apps with useful apps like Duolingo, Calm, etc. If you have decided to start taking your lunch to school/work in order to save money and eat healthier, get the tools you need to make this work including: an insulated lunch bag, insulated soup container, sandwich container, plastic container for fruit, zip lock bags, spork, etc.Consider doing the weekly money challenge in the new year; this would be a great way to save up and pay cash for next year's Christmas gifts!Consider starting a \"gift box\" in your home.  When you find nice gifts on sale for super cheap, pick them up and keep them in your gift box until you need them for a birthday or special occasion.  Also stock up on gift wrap, ribbons, and tape at the local dollar store.Instead of setting a year-long \"resolution\", consider doing shorter, more intensive monthly challenges like these.Start the new year looking beautiful, with a mani, pedi, haircut, hair color, facial, new make up, etc.  Many of these things you can do on your own instead of going to an expensive salon.Find an \"accountability partner\" to work with on your new year's resolutions like a neighbor who you can walk with each morning or a friend who is also struggling to get out of debt that you can check in and share ideas with regularly.Put together a system to save money on food in the new year.  Use store apps, clip and organize coupons, check deal sites, buy in bulk...aim to reduce your grocery bill by at least 25% over this year.Look at ways to reduce stress in your life.  Reduce the amount of news you watch, be organized so you aren't running around like a maniac in the morning, take a deep breath and count to ten before you react to a stressful situation, cut out Facebook if you find it more stressful than useful, etc.Sign up for things that will help you in the new year and in the future including a library card if you don't already have one, apply for a passport if you plan to travel in the future, apply for tax abatements/exemptions offered by your city/county, etc.If your kids came home for the holidays (like driving a long way to visit or returning from college for a few weeks), send them home with gift cards for gas/Starbucks/Subway/etc. which will save them money and provide them treats on their way back.If you bought lots of extra school supplies back when they were on sale last summer, set your kids up with all new schools supplies when they head back to school after the holidays.Take some time during the busy holidays to spend some time by yourself.  Go to a quiet coffee shop and people watch, go to a movie by yourself, get a massage, etc.Make some new family traditions by planning to celebrate holidays both usual and unusual in the coming year (add these to your calendar of course). If you need to be less sedentary in the new year, consider getting a fitness tracker which not only records your fitness activity but reminds you to get up and move if you have been sitting too long.Do something unique for New Year's Eve.  Go on a night hike with the local hiking club, offer to babysit your friend's or relative's kids while they go out and party, throw a potluck for friends instead of going out, etc."},
{"title": "Tis the Season to Count My Blessings", "date": "Friday, December 20, 2019", "text": "The end of the year makes me look back as well as look forward.  While I am now putting together plans for the new year, it is also important to remember to \"count my blessings\" so in no particular order, here are 50 things I am thankful for...The hubby (he is a wonderful husband and I am lucky to have him).Having a nice, warm, safe, home.The weather (it is pretty amazing in Las Vegas and there is no snow to shovel!).Having more than enough food to eat (not everyone can say this).Having (very) cheap but (reasonably) good health insurance (not everyone, especially in the US, can say this either).Having really amazing family and friends.Having a safe and dependable car.The internet (mostly a really really good tool if used properly).Having the ability to learn nearly everything I need to know via the internet.The ability to travel anywhere, anytime.Having money available to cover wants, needs, and emergencies.Free over-the-air TV.  Free TV is wonderful!The ability to walk long distances (not everyone can do this so I am grateful that I can).Our health, both mine and hubby's (which is improving every day!).Living in a city with the best restaurants/shopping/entertainment/free stuff/etc.The ability to cook and bake (a lot of people actually don't know how to do this so I am fortunate that I had home ec through high school as well as a grandmother who was a wonderful cook/baker who taught me how to do this).A life of ease.  There are a lot of people suffering these days whether because of financial issues, mental health issues, general health issues, job issues, etc. so while we may not be rich in material things, our life is pretty comfy.Wonderful bloggy friends.  I read many of your blogs each day (I'm usually scrolling and reading while I eat breakfast so while I don't comment because my hands are full with tea and breakfast, I do love reading your blogs!).Social media.  Social media is kind of the bane on my (our?) existence while also being the best way to keep up with friends and family both near and far.The ability to write (I've always loved to write and I love having so many opportunities to do so).Free e-books.  Our library system is amazing and offers so many free things, including the opportunity to download thousands and thousands of free e-books.Wonderful hiking opportunities.  Where we live there are so many great places to walk and hike and so many great people to enjoy these activities with!The freedoms all Americans enjoy courtesy of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.Vaccinations.  Despite what anti-vaxxers say, we are extremely lucky to be able to prevent a range of deadly diseases by getting simple vaccinations.YouTube and Reddit (these are my favorite places to hang out online).Christmas stuff...from Christmas music to Christmas lights to Christmas treats to Christmas gifts, etc. Christmas is a wonderful time of year!Living in a country with a robust economy.  There is a lot of things to complain about when it comes to our economy but I've been to many countries where there is hardly any economy and that makes for really bad living conditions.The Goodwill and second hand shops.  These are the best places to buy great stuff, really cheap, and help the environment too!Being able to do so many things online--like working, banking, shopping, etc.  We used to have to get in the car and drive all over town to get these things done.Living in a place with a great cost of living.  When I see how much my friends in other parts of the country pay for things like property tax, utilities, food, etc, I feel very fortunate that my area has everything we need for living at very reasonable prices.My guns.  Our state also has very liberal gun laws.  I like my guns.Safety stuff.  Seriously, years ago we didn't have seatbelts, bicycle helmets, gun safes, etc.  I'm surprised so many people made it to adulthood!  I used to work in injury prevention and safety so seeing how far we have come in these areas is great!Modern medicine and dental care.  Again, people complain about these things but trauma care, cardiac and stroke care, cancer care, and dental care has improved exponentially in recent decades.All of the beautiful things in the world.  If we listen to the news, all we hear about is the bad stuff (of which there is plenty) so I try to pay attention to the really good things going on around us that we don't often hear about (examples here, here, and here).Artists.  Even though I don't have an artistic bone in my body, there are so many amazing artists that it just makes me happy to look at their work (examples here, here, and here).The range of foods available now.  On the one hand, we should eat seasonally, on the other hand I had the best watermelon at a buffet a few days ago...in December!  We are literally living better than kings these days.Facebook groups.  I like being able to connect with like-minded people and FB groups seem to be the best way to do this.  Some of my favorite group include this one, this one, and this one.Ice cream--it's my favorite dessert!Having fun hobbies (I like walking, hiking, genealogy, reading, writing, and I hope to pick up the piano soon).Music.  I love music--from rap and hip hop to country to classical to pop, I love all of it!Technology...to a point.  The things we can do and the information we can access from our cell phones would be mind-blowing just a half century ago.  Of course there is a down side and we are still struggling with how to use technology ethically, but my cell phone totally rocks (great photos, maps so I don't get lost, etc).Supporting organizations that are doing good in the world including PBS, St Jude, Unity, Project 150, etc.Flowers.  I love flowers and wish I could have a rose garden at our house like we had at our last house (keeping roses alive in the desert is very difficult but our lemon tree seems to love the climate here!).Religion.  I'm kind of a non-denominational person.  I've been to a silent Unity meeting, Catholic mass, a Jewish Synagogue, a Muslim Mosque...watching people celebrating their religion, no matter what they believe in, is cool.  This week my FB feed is lit up with pictures of Christmas, Yule, Simbang Gabi, Hanukkah, etc.  Basic things like indoor plumbing, potable running water, hot water on demand, having a washer and dryer (I tried using a ringer washer once and it wasn't fun), etc.Growing older gracefully...kind of :)Poker.  Hubby loves to play poker and I am happy to watch him play something that makes him happy, gives him a social group, keeps his mind active, etc.Kind people.  We usually hear about the worst of people, but even in my city, there are great people that I've randomly run into...helpful people, interesting people, nice people, funny people, famous people, brilliant people...Nature.  Nature is amazing.  Always.And from today...I didn't want to mail my passport renewal application at the post office because of the huge lines so I slapped a bunch of postage on the envelope and hoped for the best and today they cashed the check I sent so all seems to be well with the application!"},

{"title": "Getting Ready for the New Year", "date": "Monday, December 16, 2019", "text": "I spent the day getting ready for the new year!  Today I...picked up hubby's prescription medications before the end of the year (next week at the hospital should be an absolute zoo since the hospital/pharmacy will be closed for several days at the end of the year).  On the one hand, all of his meds are free compliments of the military, on the other hand, there are lines and long waits everywhere, even on a good day.cleaned the house from top to bottom.  I do this weekly anyway but I like minimizing as I go along in order to get rid of unneeded stuff.  We now have big boxes of stuff waiting to be sent to the Philippines and taken to the Goodwill.got my new monthly calendar book (above) and added all important dates for next year (birthdays, holidays, events I want to attend, etc).  I still absolutely love paper calendars.updated all of my websites.  I even resurrected my Vegas Walking website as I intend to do a lot of walking in the new year.deleted a lot of unneeded files on my computer.  In addition to trying to be more anti-consumption and minimalist in the new year, I am also aiming for digital minimalism too and figured it's about time I clean up files on my computer that I haven't needed for years.am thinking about what I will do for income in the new year.  I came across this useful list, but on the down side, at least from what I've been reading, the glory days of easily landing a high income job, even with exceptional experience, seem to be over (example here).  Sad.took some spare time and fell down the rabbit-hole of YouTube.  I thought it was interesting that this lady mentioned doing the same thing in her blog post today.  Whenever you watch a video on YouTube, dozens of more videos are suggested for you, so I've seen everything from this guy completely renovating a basement on fast forward, to this teenage stripper giving life advice to my favorite tech review lady to this guy's interesting/irreverent take on travel destinations."},
{"title": "An Update in 10 Points...", "date": "Sunday, December 15, 2019", "text": "It's been a busy couple of weeks and I just realized I hadn't blogged in ages!  Here's what's been happening...Our weather this month is perfect!  It's bright and sunny and relatively warm and if we really need snow we can drive about 30 minutes to the mountains to ski.  We keep watching the news about snow and ice storms all over the country and don't miss that kind of weather one bit.The National Finals Rodeo is finished for this year so there should be a noticeable lack of cowboys around town starting tomorrow.One of the grandkids will spend Christmas in jail.  Their mom called and asked if we would pay bail to which we replied \"sorry, no\".  We don't bail anyone out of jail since it was their own actions that landed them there in the first place.  Sad, but they don't get rewarded for being stupid.The presidential impeachment situation is weird and should get even more interesting next week.We had a wonderful Christmas dinner party with my walking club.  The group tries different restaurants each year so we have went places we otherwise would never have tried; the Italian place last night was great!I have done hardly any Christmas shopping this year.  I bought small gifts for my friend and her family in Japan (and made sure they were lightweight gifts because shipping costs are astronomical!) and we sent money to all of the kids which pretty much concluded our holiday gift giving.We have been doing our usual Christmas romance movie binge nearly every evening.  Thank goodness for Netflix and Amazon Prime!I'm debating starting a YouTube channel at the beginning of the year.  I watch so many YouTube videos that I think \"I can do that\" but it is definitely a lot of work with filming and editing the videos so I am still considering if this is a good idea or not.I am also thinking about what kind of income-generating things I want to do in the new year.  A job is so...not me, really (I've always liked owning my own businesses better than working for someone else).  There is a lot of talk about a recession in the next year or so, so I would really like to be completely out of debt and even make a big dent in the mortgage we have on our house too if possible.We have fallen off of the healthy eating band-wagon (holidays and goodies and all of that) so that will be a top priority in the new year too!"},
{"title": "Less Than Three Weeks Until Christmas?!", "date": "Thursday, December 5, 2019", "text": "I heard on the news today that there is less than three weeks until Christmas and I immediately had to check my calendar to be sure.  Sure enough, 19 days from now it will be Christmas Eve.  Yikes!Currently we have no Christmas plans but we usually end up cooking for all of the cousins and their families so I guess we better get to planning that and I have friends in Japan that I send gifts to which I need to do ASAP.  Fortunately we culled our Christmas gift list (after our immediate family expanded to 100+ people!) and now only send money to the kids (5 of them) which they use to buy things for themselves and the grandkids (13 of them!).  We figure it is better for them to buy what they like instead of giving gifts they may not even want.  Hubby and I don't give each other gifts anymore since we just buy what we want, when we want it, but hubby does make me a home-made card for Christmas which I look forward to each year.  I don't even do Christmas cards anymore (Facebook is so much easier and faster and I'm a bit lazy so...), and we didn't decorate either (hubby's days of climbing ladders to put up lights are long past and we don't have any kids or grandkids here to need a Christmas tree--plus trees in the desert cost around $80 which is crazy considering that when we lived in Washington we just went outside and cut down a tree for the cost of a $5 permit!).I hope your Christmas plans are coming along well..."},

{"title": "Holiday Shopping...Or Not", "date": "Sunday, December 1, 2019", "text": "When the Black Friday ads started coming out--at about the time we were cleaning up from Halloween!--there was so much cool tech that I absolutely wanted.  Note that I really don't even need any new tech as my phone still works great, my laptop is awesome, and I have not one but two tablets which also work great.  But I love tech and the prices on everything from tablets and laptops to appliances and TVs are soooo cheap this year!The first item on my list was a Fitbit which was on sale for only $49.  I figure that having a Fitbit will inspire me to walk more (I think this every year when they are heavily advertised!) so I told hubby that I was going to pick one up and he said \"why? you've had three of them and you return them within a week.\"  Hubby is right, of course.  I just couldn't really get into Fitbits before because they were so complicated.  I couldn't turn them on and off when I wanted, I had to wear them around my wrist and I never wear watches or jewelry so it was kind of annoying, and they just seemed like more hassle than they were worth.So I decided not to pick up the Fitbit and tried to figure out what else I could use instead and I found that there are several free apps for my cell phone that would basically do the same thing.  I tried a couple of apps which I didn't like then I read about a simple pedometer app--called Pedometer, how basic is that?--which is super basic and easy to use.  I gave it a try today when I did a 10k and I LOVE it!  It is super simple, just push start when I start walking and stop when I am done, and it is also very accurate even though I was walking both inside and outside.A bit of creativity--and free technology--saved me at least $50!  Now I am going to look at the other things on my \"want\" list and try to come up with cheaper solutions that would be just as good as spending money on stuff I don't really need."},

{"title": "10 Things for Today", "date": "Sunday, November 24, 2019", "text": "Today I am...Shampooing all of our carpets.  The $50 carpet shampooer we bought a few years ago has paid for itself several times over.  It's easy to use and does a great job freshening up/cleaning the carpet.Celebrating hubby's great blood pressure.  The few times he checked it when everyone was here it was 160/90 (!).  In the last two days while eating a healthier diet at home (and with much less stress) it has dropped to 120/70 with no change in his medications.Trying to avoid all of the Black Friday ads online.  There are so many great deals on tech right now but I really don't need anything new, even though the prices are really low.Deciding to #OptOutside on Black Friday (the Friday after Thanksgiving).  Since I don't need to shop, I will do another 10k with my walking club on that day, thus saving money and improving my health at the same time.Thinking about new year resolutions.  Who am I kidding?  I never keep my resolutions but about this time of year I come up with all kinds of things I want to accomplish in the new year.Wondering if we will get snow for Thanksgiving.  Snow in Las Vegas is really rare but apparently the weather forecasters think we may get some this week which would be really exciting!Looking forward to the National Finals Rodeo which takes place in Las Vegas starting next week.  There will be cowboys everywhere, lots of great rodeo events (some free!), and even the ever-popular Cowboy Christmas craft fair.Still trying to figure out what to do for our anniversary next week.  After 33 years together, our anniversary isn't such a big event but I would still like to come up with something nice to do with the hubby.Debating the merits of fostering a pet for the holidays.  Our local animal shelter is looking for foster families for the holidays.  This seems like a great idea (kind of a try before you buy for pets) but I don't know if we would be too busy to do this or not.Praying for Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  She is simply amazing and I really really hope she outlasts Trump's presidency."},
{"title": "Back to Normal!", "date": "Saturday, November 23, 2019", "text": "The rest of our guests left yesterday so as of today, we are back to \"normal\"!  I headed out on a 10k walk with my walking club this morning around a pretty park in Las Vegas and hubby went and played poker in peace without having to worry about meeting up with people/picking up or dropping off people/cooking for people/etc.  It's been quite the busy month! Now that hubby's surgery sites have healed up, the wedding is done, and the remaining guests who stayed an extra couple weeks after the wedding have all returned home, we are looking forward to a very quiet Thanksgiving with just the hubby and I (something we started a few years ago and really enjoy compared to the hustle and bustle of cooking for a huge group of people...we will do Christmas for everyone but Thanksgiving will be simple and peaceful).Among the events of the past couple weeks...We have eaten out SO MUCH because everyone wants to try all of the fabulous restaurants in Las Vegas but now I feel like a stuffed turkey and hubby's blood pressure shot up so we will get back on track with at-home, mostly vegan meals which are way healthier than restaurant food.One of our guests forgot her insulin at home when she came to visit.  Talk about a mad scramble!  A visit to the ER would have been very expensive, ditto a visit to urgent care (did you know that ONE Lantus insulin pen costs nearly $500??? Yikes).  Community clinics don't carry insulin (they said go to the ER), so she spent nearly $70 to have her insulin FedExed to her overnight.The same guest, who happens to be in pretty poor health, fell twice while she was here.  She is elderly and ill and not at all steady on her feet and she was walking ahead of us and tumbled right down the stairs.  Fortunately nothing was broken, unfortunately the poor lady was black and blue from head to toe (blood thinners will do that to you) and she looked like she went a few rounds with Mike Tyson!  This is the first vacation she has had in years so she was still happy to have got to visit and see some of the relatives she hadn't seen in ages. The SIL played in a big bingo tournament and won $17,000!  I've never won that much in my life and she was only marginally excited about her win but if I won that much I would be doing cartwheels or something!The weather her has been wonderful and it is the end of November.  When our guests were heading back home to the cold and snow, I was extra thankful that we live in a sunny, and generally warm, place.I'm still marveling at the fact that while I have only worked about six weeks of this entire year, money still seems to \"show up\" when I need it so I can pay all of my bills; it's quite amazing actually.  I will refocus on either getting a job or starting some sort of business in the new year.Finally, a couple things that seemed like big (financial) deals turned out to be minimal things.  I thought I might have needed another crown when I went to the dentist a few days ago but he said my teeth are fine, I just need a cleaning so that was wonderful, then hubby's van had some sort of binging oil light go off which according to Google might have been something major but turned out to be a simple sensor replacement--yippee!"},
{"title": "A Vegas Wedding--20 Tips", "date": "Monday, November 11, 2019", "text": "We survived wedding week in Las Vegas!  Actually everything went very well, no drama at all--except that the bride was a half hour late for the wedding and 45 minutes late for the dinner but according to family, that was an improvement for her (?!).  Now most of the guests have left and we are in clean up/catch up mode.  Here's some things we learned from hosting the wedding:We had the wedding at Chapel of the Flowers and picked a minimal package deal (limo, venue, ceremony, some photos, etc).  For a grand total of $700 it was a really nice and sentimental wedding, not \"cheesy\" at all as some people think quicky Las Vegas weddings go.  Everyone commented on the great job done by the lady who married the couple and even though it was pretty quick, overall it was very nice.We had the reception dinner at the Green Valley Ranch buffet.  Again, a Vegas buffet may sound \"cheesy\" too, but everyone enjoyed the dinner and I think more than a hundred crabs were eaten by the group!  The total cost for 25 people for the dinner was $1400.  Also, the staff was AMAZING and wonderful to work with!We turned a lot of our guests on to the benefits of the Goodwill.  From dresses to shoes to belts to ties, whenever someone said they needed to go buy something for their outfit for the wedding we told them to try the Goodwill first, and surprisingly many people who had never even been to a Goodwill are now converts!The bride went to a salon for a mani/pedi but the rest of us did our own mani/pedis at home--we all ended up with nice nails for the (discount) cost of some high-end nail polish at Ross (I love the OPI brand of nail polish but it can get pretty expensive at a regular store, Ross often has it on sale at half price).We had a few house guests and everyone else stayed in hotels/time shares.  With people coming and going, they were able to squeeze quite a few people into each time share room so I think this cost was pretty minimal for everyone.The SIL already had her car here and we loaned our van to the group so only one family needed to rent a car and another family drove here so they had a car.  We were able to shuttle everyone around with ease this way.The cooking and dish washing was never-ending!  We provided meals every day for the group which was a great way to save everyone money.  We pretty much cleared out the pantry and freezer this way but it was good to rotate meat and pantry items that we don't eat much any more.  Several of the guests pitched in to help with cooking and dishwashing so that part was easier than just the hubby and I doing all of the work.We also bought a lot of food items on sale (we went through 20 pounds of rice!) so these frugal food buys really helped us feed a lot of people for cheap.I love to bake anyway so I made lots of desserts everyday which was pretty easy to do--I simply baked packaged cake mixes, made cookies, and baked other desserts to keep everyone happy and fed.Fortunately our local grocery store had bottled was on sale at three cases for $5.  Everyone drinks bottled water here because our tap water is so icky so cheap bottled water was great to have on hand.  If we had a lot of long-term guests I would have looked into getting a five-gallon water dispenser because you can fill up 5 gallon water bottles at the grocery store for much cheaper than the cost of small bottles of water.I'm also glad we stocked up on everything from toilet paper to dish soap to laundry detergent over the past few months as these items came on sale--we upped our usage of these products exponentially when we had lots of people at the house.For entertainment people were pretty much left on their own.  Some wanted to go to bingo, some wanted to hit up the Fremont Experience at night, some wanted to walk the famous Las Vegas Strip.  We provided info on free and cheap things to do and some people did these things, others went to Skyzone with some of the kids and some did the roller coaster at NYNY.Our event was not with minor disasters--one toilet decided to give up the ghost and luckily we had a kit for the \"innards\" of the toilet that we hadn't got around to installing so we quickly installed it and fixed the problem.  The battery died on the SIL's car but the guys at the shop had it towed in and fixed very quickly.  One daughter arrived with a tiny backpack (thanks to the restrictions of Spirit Air) but she ended up taking lots of extra stuff home so we figured that paying for one suitcase ($42!) and mailing one large flat rate box ($22) was cheaper than her taking two checked bags back with her or paying for an over-weight bag.  And believe me, I checked every conceivable way to get her stuff back home including mailing it via UPS and shipping it via Amtrak and Greyhound, all were more expensive than the solution we came up with.Netflix is awesome.  There was downtime when everyone was hanging out at our house and Netflix was the go-to for movie entertainment.  We also had some board games and card games going for free, fun entertainment!Several people in the group were either active duty or retired military and since the wedding weekend fell on Veteran's Day, the group took advantage of several Veteran's Day specials including free pizzas from Little Caesars, free buffets at South Point, some got coupons from Great Clips for free haircuts, and this evening I think a few headed out to Applebees and other restaurants which were offering free meals for military and vets.  On a side note, I used the $40 veteran's discount for my next year's Amazon Prime membership (the deal expires today FYI).The weather was perfect this week.  It was in the high 70s so it was perfect weather for people to do things outside.  The wedding couple even went outside of some of the fancy hotels and took \"wedding\" pictures with beautiful backdrops.I created a schedule prior to everyone arriving which showed the must-attend events like the wedding and dinner, as well as the dates and times of everyone arriving and departing Las Vegas.  This way some of the people were able to be picked up or dropped off at the airport in groups instead of being individually picked up or taken to the airport for their flights.Everyone took a lot of photos.  We started out taking photos with each person's phone but taking one photo with six phones was crazy so we decided that people would take a photo then share it with the group.  I've got photos pouring in now which I need to file.Once again I was reminded to roll with the punches.  Hubby's huge family is notorious for making a plan then changing it--several times--within minutes.  As a Type A, highly organized person, this makes me crazy.  But I resolved to chill out and go with the flow so when the bride was late to meet the limo, instead of freaking out, I went over and talked to the limo driver who had some interesting tales to tell (and also some great routes through the city with minimal traffic!).Overall this was a wonderful event and a great opportunity to catch up with friends and family.  Tomorrow we will work on refilling the freezer and pantry!"},
{"title": "10 Random Things for This Week", "date": "Friday, November 1, 2019", "text": "In no particular order...First, happy belated Halloween!  I hope you all had an enjoyable Halloween last evening.  We didn't do much, actually we didn't do anything at all for the holiday, since we didn't get home until late and had so few trick or treaters last year that we didn't bother this year.Don't forget to turn your clocks back on Saturday before you go to bed if you are in (most) places in the US and Canada.  Yeah--an extra hour of sleep!Our neighbors just quickly moved out yesterday.  We thought they had bought the house but it looks like they were renting since I saw the house listed for rent on Zillow when I checked it yesterday.  Shockingly the owner is listing the house for four times what our mortgage is!  I guess that shows how much housing prices have risen over the past eight years since we moved here.  On the other hand, I am pretty sure wages haven't increased 400% over the same amount of time.  Yikes.Something I just learned at the ripe old age of 52...my bra straps tend to fall down, like a lot.  I've lost count of how many bras I've given away because of this problem.  So I hopped online to figure out why this is happening and it said to tighten up the band/buy a smaller band size and larger cup size.  So I made the band as tight as it would go and no more problem!  Color me shocked that the fix could be this easy!The wedding is a week away.  What a freakin nightmare.  People who are part of the wedding have started inviting random friends who are in no way part of the wedding to the expensive (to us, anyway) dinner then the bride invited some last minute guests who will either be fine or cause a Jerry Springer-esque situation (I'm guessing it will be the latter unfortunately).  But it's her wedding...Meanwhile I've go a super busy weekend planned with cleaning and prepping food and getting everything ready for guests who will be coming and going for the next few weeks both for the wedding as well as people coming just for vacation.It's now November and while I won't be participating, there are a couple of cool November challenges happening including No-Spend November and NaNoWriMo.It seems like the whole of California is on fire.  Every day there are reports of new wildfires and millions of people have had to evacuate.  Hopefully if any of you are in California, you are staying safe!  I can't imagine having to run through the flames to evacuate a wildfire at the last minute like they keep showing repeatedly on the news.  Scary!Another scary sign of the times...Walmart started their Christmas sales last week!  Pretty soon Christmas creep will start around the 4th of July...ayayayFinally, I saw a guy die today.  At least I think he is dead, if not, he will be very lucky to survive.  Hubby was bowling with his team today and a few lanes over a guy got up to bowl and before he could throw his ball, he keeled over.  He was unresponsive, a security guy was there so he jumped in to do CPR, the paramedics eventually showed up and took over but after many minutes, they were still doing CPR when they hauled him out on a gurney.  Needless to say the mostly senior group were pretty rattled afterwards.  Life is so fleeting..."},
{"title": "Putting Together a Frugal Wedding", "date": "Monday, October 28, 2019", "text": "Hubby's daughter will soon be getting married here in Las Vegas.  We will be paying for most of the wedding as a gift to her and, since we are basically living on a fixed income, we offered her a nice wedding, within our frugal limits, and she was more than happy to accept (fortunately she is pretty frugal-minded too).  Here's how we have been saving money so far...We booked a \"nice enough\" package at a \"nice enough\" venue.  Weddings in Vegas can be as elaborate and expensive as you want them to be but since we are #1, all about saving money, and #2, enjoyed a friend's wedding at this same venue a couple years ago, we went with a package deal that will provide the chapel, wedding service, basic photos, limo transport, etc.  Fortunately the SIL is paying for this part of the wedding as the daughter is her favorite niece!Next we booked a nice buffet for the wedding dinner ($55 per person but with all you can eat prime rib, crab, shrimp, etc).  Catering a wedding would require that we reserve a venue to host the dinner and catering for the food and a bar, etc. which would be really expensive.  This, we think, is a nice alternative (plus most of the people in the wedding party have been to this buffet before and love it).  The cost should be under $1500 which we think is a great deal (and which part we are paying for).I did the invitations.  I basically put together an invite with a photo collage of the couple using Microsoft Publisher, printed them out on my printer, and off they went in the mail (the most expensive cost was stamps).  This saved a lot of money over professionally printed invitations.I needed a dress for the wedding.  I will literally be wearing the dress for an hour or so which is why I didn't want to spend much on it but I still wanted it to look nice so off we went to the Goodwill where I found this nice outfit for about $8! Since this is a destination wedding for the bride and most of the attendees (mostly relatives), everyone was in charge of paying for their own airfare and hotel.  We are offering our guest rooms up to another daughter and one of hubby's sisters, but mostly everyone is paying their own way here.  We will be providing meals for everyone when they don't feel like eating out.  This will mostly be breakfast, snacks, a brunch the day after the wedding, and random other meals.  To do this we have been shopping loss leaders like crazy (we got 5 dozen eggs for $5...that will be breakfast, cheap sale meat which will become various dishes, and we got a great sale on rice today--40 pounds for $13 which is basically unheard of but we saw the sale today and grabbed 80 pounds of rice!).Speaking of food, we tend to send food to everyone's hotel/time share room so they always have food and don't need to run out and buy food when they are hungry.  I got busy yesterday experimenting with recipes and made some pretty good (if I do say so myself) Filipino bread (pan de sal).  Hubby was really impressed and this will save us buying this popular bread for the brunch and the snacks.  I will also make all of the desserts which is pretty easy to do. Since this is a quick trip for most people (they will come just prior to the wedding and stay for the holiday weekend) we don't have much planned for entertainment.  I will give everyone a list of free and cheap activities that are happening and let them decide what they want to do (fortunately Las Vegas has lots and lots of free activities that people can choose to do!).So far, everything is going along great!  I'll write a final report after the wedding."},

{"title": "Apparently I Am a Tech Genius!", "date": "Monday, October 21, 2019", "text": "Not really, but I certainly felt like one when hubby and I successfully changed out the battery in my old tablet and it actually worked afterwards(!).  In fact, we were feeling so technically proficient that after the tablet experiment we took the hard drive out of an old laptop and killed it (the hard drive) with a hammer.In the case of the tablet, the battery was nearing five years old and draining really fast so I ordered a battery online for $20 then we watched a video on how to change it out and it was actually pretty easy to do.  I was really surprised that the tablet turned on when we put it back together since we had never done something like this before; hopefully this battery holds a longer charge and keeps the tablet alive for a few more years!In the case of the laptop, it was one I had had for years.  It was an early prototype for the newer Dell XPS and was top of the line back in the day.  But I never really liked it so it sat in the closet for years and when I took it out recently to reset it so I could give it away, it wouldn't turn on.  Again, we used YouTube to figure out how to remove the battery thinking to replace the battery so it would work again but after we took the battery out, I went online only to find the battery cost $199!  Yikes.  Since I didn't want to put so much money into a very old laptop, I decided to remove the hard drive since it still had my old files on it which I don't want to share with anyone who may end up with the laptop, put it back together sans the hard drive but with the old, nonfunctional battery, and we will send it to the Philippines where they can fix pretty much anything for very low prices.The moral of this story is that you can actually do many technical things that you may not think you can do with only the help of a few YouTube videos.  If you have old tech devices that you want to bring back to life with cheap online components, give it a shot!"},
{"title": "10 Ways We Saved Money Today", "date": "Friday, October 18, 2019", "text": "It's been a busy (yet financially productive!) day today.  Here are all the ways we saved money today...First we ran hubby's van over to Discount Tires and got the tires rotated for free.  We always buy our tires here because their service is so wonderful!Then I took our trusty pole saw and hacked down a few more dying palm fronds from our trees (see tree above).  When I called the tree guys they wanted $199 PER VISIT to trim these trees...if I had to pay that much every month or so just to lop off some dead palm fronds we would be bankrupt!  The $40 pole saw was a great investment.Next, we have been talking about getting a new stove.  Our old stove still works great but the drawer under the stove was a mess--it wouldn't slide in or slide out and was stuck sideways and was quite an eyesore--so yesterday evening when I was watching YouTube I checked \"how to fix drawer under stove and found this video.  The fix seemed pretty simple so we gave it a shot this morning and we didn't even need to buy new parts, one of the drawer slides had fell off so we screwed it back on, and it works perfectly now.  No need for a new stove now :)We have had the SIL's car in the shop for a few days to figure out what problems it has (the car is a 2001 but she loves it and still wants to keep it in tip top shape).  Unfortunately, the bill to fix everything that is wrong with it would be around $2,000 (!); fortunately we have a great relationship with the guys who own the shop so they are both fair with their prices and quite generous (they didn't charge us anything for a multi-hour evaluation of the car!).  We suggested she just drive it until it dies as it still runs fine even though the water pump leaks, the AC is OK and not great, etc.We went to the Palms Casino Buffet for lunch today.  The couple in front of us paid $38 for their two buffets and we paid $2.75.  We did this by using a buy-one, get-one-free coupon, using hubby's player's card (he plays poker so he has a higher rated card which gets bigger discounts at restaurants), using hubby's comp points (earned while playing poker), then paying the remainder of $2.75.We have managed to keep both the air conditioning and the heating systems turned off so far.  The weather has been pretty great over the past few weeks, not too hot and not too cold, and if we need it, we just use a portable fan or small space heater so we don't have to use the whole-house systems.  Hopefully we can keep doing this for at least another month or so in order to save money on heating.I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet which is really old in tablet years (it's from 2015!).  I bought a new tablet a couple months ago but ended up returning it because it was just too big (10\" as opposed to the 8\" S2).  I just love this smaller-sized tablet but Samsung hasn't released a better 8 inch tablet since then and my tablet has a battery that drains very quickly so I have been looking at all of the 8\" tablet options, of which there are very few and none that I like, and so I decided to just try putting a new battery in my old tablet.  I hopped on Amazon and ordered a new battery for my tablet and will see if this $20 investment will add more years of life to it.  Again, the \"how to\" part of replacing the battery can be found on YouTube.We have been shopping loss leaders like crazy.  We will be hosting about 25 people in a few weeks for the daughter's wedding.  Some people will stay in our guest rooms and the others have booked their time shares/hotel rooms near by, but we will be providing meals for a few days while everyone is here.  We used to have a catering business so cooking for a crowd is no big deal but buying enough food (mostly meat and vegetables for Asian dishes) can get really expensive, really fast.  Each week we pick up any super cheap loss leaders/sale items at the store that we can find and are stockpiling these items until everyone arrives.  There is a huge difference in price between 49 cent a pound chicken legs and buying full-priced chicken, for example.  We also stretch our meals by making a lot of rice and noodle dishes which are mainly a lot of the cheaper item (rice or noodles) with only a little bit of meat and vegetables needed.  I also bake all kinds of inexpensive, but very tasty, desserts.Also last night while watching YouTube, I came across this video on how much it actually costs to work and live like the average American.  This video makes me want to be even more frugal and as financially free as possible.Finally, we are making small home improvements instead of going all out.  On the one hand, I would love to have all new paint and flooring done before everyone comes here in a few weeks but that would be a huge expense on tops of the expenses we will be covering for the wedding.  Instead I will be shampooing the carpets, scrubbing all of the cabinets, and maybe doing a bit of touch-up painting...basically anything to make the house look great if it can be done for very little money."},
{"title": "So Appy", "date": "Wednesday, October 16, 2019", "text": "One way I've been saving money these days is by using apps on my cell phone.  There are thousands of apps out there designed to help you save money and while I am probably barely scratching the surface of money-saving app use, there are a handful of apps that I use often that save me about $10+ per week.  These include...TMobile Tuesday app.  Since I have TMobile I added this app and check it each Tuesday to see what deals they are offering.  Sometimes there is nothing I really need but other times there are some great deals (like this week's $2 discount at Baskin Robbins which I used to buy an already on sale B & R Blast which made my cost for the drink only $1.24!).Little Caesars app.  We don't eat pizza from this restaurant very often but we often buy their $5 pizzas for other people like today when I brought two pizzas to the guys at the shop who keep hubby's and the SIL's old cars running so well; often don't even charge us for the work they do so we always bring them food.  Today I used the Little Caesar's app and got free crazy bread with my order!Albertsons app.  This is our local grocery store and each week we use the app to get some great app-only savings.  Today I picked up a couple of 40 ounce bottles of All laundry detergent for only 64 cents each with the app!  Charity Miles app.  While this app doesn't save me money, I use it when I walk and it donates a certain amount (a few cents maybe?) per mile to the charity of my choice.  I'm walking anyway so this is a great way to help a non-profit at the same time.Starbucks app.  Sometimes I will add money to my Starbucks app and occasionally I will receive Starbucks gift cards which I can add to the app.  Either way, when I use the Starbucks app to buy a drink, I also accrue \"points\" for free stuff like bakery items and drinks.This week I will be looking into apps that will actually help me make money which I've heard about but never really considered before.  What your favorite apps to help you save or earn money?"},
{"title": "In Which I Applied for a Job and Didn't Get It", "date": "Monday, October 14, 2019", "text": "So I figured I should probably get some sort of job, especially now that there are a lot of seasonal, short-term jobs being advertised for the holidays.  I was walking by Target yesterday on my morning walk and saw that they were hiring for the holidays so when I got home I applied online and within about ten minutes of hitting \"send\" someone from HR called and asked me to come in for an interview.  I went in for the interview, answered the questions somewhat awkwardly, and got an email today saying I wasn't chosen for any of their jobs(!).I think I am not meant for working a \"normal\" job.  I told hubby that I wasn't chosen and he was rather happy about it (we have a wedding coming up, I usually go with hubby to all of his medical appointments of which he has many coming up, and they said part of the job was working Thanksgiving and Black Friday(!) eeekkkk).  I also think I don't interview well.  Actually this was probably the first \"official\" job interview I had ever done.  Either someone I knew hired me, someone recommended me for a job and no interview was done, or the places I applied for were so desperate for people they just hired me on the spot.And then there were the interview questions...  \"What do you do when you get mad at a coworker?\" \"Um why would I get mad at a coworker?\"  I've never not liked my coworkers and if I have an issue with someone I just talk to them and we come to some sort of agreement or agreement to disagree.  No big deal.  \"When have you gone above and beyond at your job?\"  \"Um any time I need to?\"  If things need to be done, within or above the scope of work, I don't determine if I need to \"go above and beyond\" I just do it because it needs to be done.  Needless to say I was probably not their idea of a great employee...oh well.Edit: right after I posted this, I came across this article so now I don't feel so bad.  I would feel horrible taking a job that gives hours to new temp people while hanging permanent, full-time employees out to dry with very few hours each week!"},

{"title": "5 Ways I'm Saving Money This Weekend", "date": "Saturday, October 5, 2019", "text": "It's wonderful to be home!  Hospitals are great when you need them but home is always better (and way more relaxing).  This weekend we are saving money by...We got a notice from the HOA that some of the fronds on our palm trees are dead (no kidding, I can see them.  If I never live in an HOA again it will be too soon).  Our trees are getting pretty tall so I don't want either the hubby or I to climb up a ladder and trim them so I called the guy who chopped them down last time but I guess he is no longer in business.  I called around to other tree trimming places and got estimates of $200(!!!) to trim like a dozen limp fronds from our trees.  That was way too much IMHO so I went to Home Depot and got a 14 foot pole saw and trimmed them myself.  Hubby, being the macho guy he is, tried insisting on helping me which I refused (that's all he needs is to pop all of his stitches out!), and while I still need to cut some more dead or dying fronds (which is harder than it looks!), I think this is a great way to save money even if it does take quite a bit more physical effort.Hubby is still recovering--doing well but still feeling like someone sliced open his guts, which they technically did--so we are just staying around the house this weekend so he can continue to rest.  Not only does this save gas but it also saves small expenses that tend to crop up when we are out and about like hitting up the grocery and 99 Cent stores.We are eating all of our meals at home.  This saves a lot of money!  We have plenty of food in the pantry, refrigerator, and freezer so cooking up three meals a day is simple and money saving (plus having leftovers is an added bonus).  It is also much healthier to eat at home instead of at restaurants.When I took my car into the dealership a while back to have the oil changed (the cheapest place for an all synthetic oil change) they said it was time to have the tires rotated.  They wanted to charge about $70(!) to do this so I declined.  I called our local Discount Tire to see how much they would charge to rotate the tires and they said it was free so I ran the car up to get the tires rotated for free but picked up a couple of $5 Little Caesars pizzas as a sort of tip for the guys working in the shop.  It was a win-win for everyone and a great way to save money!I changed out the air intake filters in our house.  We do this a couple of times a year, in the spring and fall, and this really helps extend the life of our HVAC system (I also buy the filters in bulk when they come on sale at Walmart or Costco).I hope you are all having a wonderful weekend!Edit:  One more way I just saved money this weekend...I have had a great cell phone plan through TMobile which included three lines of unlimited everything (calling, text, data, hot spot data, international use, etc) which was a wonderful plan, cost wise.  We gave one of the lines to one of the kids and hubby and I use the other lines.  Now the son no longer needs the line since his job provides him a cell phone so I checked TMobile and found that we qualify for their senior phone plan which includes two lines of unlimited everything for only $55 a month so I switched plans and now we are saving $45 a month!"},
{"title": "A Week in the Hospital and 10 Things I Learned", "date": "Thursday, October 3, 2019", "text": "Hubby's gall bladder decided it didn't want to wait a few weeks to be removed so it threw a very painful fit, I rushed hubby back to the hospital, and he had to wait in the hospital for a few days for his blood thinners to wear off before it could be taken out.  I wouldn't wish a week in the hospital on anyone!  Here's some things I learned...Thank God I didn't go to medical school.  Sometime in my late 30s I had the bright idea to go back to college and become a doctor.  I took a few refresher courses in chemistry and biology (it had been a couple decades since my last college science classes) and immediately decided that being a doctor wasn't the best idea I ever had.  During the past week, watching medical providers day and night in the hospital, made me realize I don't have the patience and/or fortitude to be a doctor (but I greatly admire everyone who works in a hospital from the cleaning lady to the chief of surgery...they need an amazing skill set to work with people who are experiencing their worst days while providing the care and understanding tailored to each patient).Thank God for our great health insurance.  We would have been at $1 million+ in health care costs by now just for the past couple of years of hubby's hospitalizations/prescriptions/etc.  Everyone at this hospital was in the same boat (military so free medical coverage for everything from prescriptions to in-patient care to ER services, etc) which every American should get.  I am not a socialist, but socialized medicine is a necessary thing.  People shouldn't have to worry about money when it comes to saving their lives, they shouldn't have to worry about one minor health incident pushing them into bankruptcy, and really, it's hard to even think straight when you or someone you love is in gut-wrenching pain.  I hope our next president forces this issue until it becomes a reality.The best part about the hospital stay?  The blanket warmer (what an awesome invention!), the water/ice machine, and the snack area (there was a snack drawer and refrigerator full of food for patient's families which was really nice).  The staff was wonderful and the care hubby received was great.The worst part about the hospital stay?  You literally can't sleep in a hospital.  The patients are constantly woken up for blood pressure checks, doctor's rounds, changing IVs after the IV machine starts beeping like crazy, etc. and this goes on 24/7.  It's an awful place to rest.  Most nights, I went home, ate, cleaned up the house, and slept then headed back in the morning to stay with hubby for the day.  The evening he had surgery I decided to stay overnight with him in the hospital because he was pretty out of it and disoriented by the anesthesia so I didn't want him waking up alone.  It was a miserable night for both of us (me especially, I need eight solid hours of sleep a night or I am like a zombie!).There is probably no better deterrent to unhealthy living than overhearing patients as they describe their current health problems and their health histories (the \"walls\" in the ER are curtains as is the divider in each in-patient room).  The last place I want to end up is a hospital so I need to step up my exercise and healthy eating game!I was surprised at how many in-patients were there alone.  I would arrive each day at 6am and didn't leave hubby's side until he went to sleep for the night to act as an advocate/helper for him.  I helped hubby with getting him water/bathing/walking around after surgery, provided information to the doctors and nurses for him, remembered stuff the doctors told him that he would probably forget (it's hard to remember stuff when you are in abject pain!), and generally helped out any way I could which both insures accuracy between the patient and healthcare providers as well as helps out the staff who are always really busy.Always always always carry a list on your phone of your allergies, medical history, and current medications.  Hubby was asked for this information so many times and when people are in a medical crisis, the last thing they can remember is the dates of previous medical care and their accurate prescription information, especially if they are taking a dozen prescription medicines with weird names and different dosages.  I keep a list of this info for hubby on my phone and simply showed the list to everyone who asked or emailed it to them so everyone would have accurate information.Fortunately we don't have kids, pets, or jobs.  When someone is in a medical crisis, 100% of your attention goes to taking care of them but many people in this situation have the added burden of arranging emergency child care, finding someone to care for their pets if they will not be home for days, covering shifts at work, etc.  I guess this is a good reminder to everyone to have an emergency plan for kids/pets/work if you find yourself in a similar emergency situation.Due to hubby's previous medical incidents, I now keep a \"go bag\" on hand for both of us which has everything either one of us would need if we have to stay at the hospital for a few days (change of clothes, small toiletry kit, cell phone charger, snacks, etc).The doctor gave us a photo of hubby's gall bladder (a parting gift?) which was interesting.  I sent it to my friend who is a doctor and she said it looked horrible so I am just thankful the thing didn't rupture and cause even more problems.  I guess there is a bright side to even a bad situation!"},
{"title": "An Update in 10 Points", "date": "Friday, September 27, 2019", "text": "I just realized I haven't posted here in ages.  It's been a busy couple of weeks...I didn't get to the Life is Beautiful Festival but I did walk around the area the day after the event was finished when everything was being cleaned up and hauled away.  Fortunately the murals that are painted on the side of the buildings stay until someone decides to paint over them (some murals have been there for years).  The above is one of the many murals you can see in downtown Las Vegas.Hubby has been in and out of the hospital a few times over the past couple of weeks (no I still don't have a long-term plan except to get the car and house paid off as soon as possible).  After lots and lots of tests and lots and lots of doctors checking on him, they decided his heart is fine (yeah!!) but his gall bladder is not (bummer...and extremely painful according to hubby).  So that sucker is going to be yanked out in a couple weeks and he should feel much better afterwards.I watched the entire Ken Burns Country Music movie on PBS (all eight episodes for a total of 16 hours...a great way to kill time in the hospital!).  It was a wonderful movie, full of history and music I hadn't heard in years.  It must have been a work of epic proportions just to gather the information and edit so many hours of video...pretty amazing overall!I've decided to delete Facebook.  I'm not a fan of the platform for several reasons (privacy, marketing, not getting to see all of your friend's posts unless they are boosted, tracking you even when the app is shut off) so until I can find a better platform (harder than it sounds), I will just keep in touch with people via email, text, and their blogs.The weather in Las Vegas is becoming perfect--a nice 80ish degrees everyday!  While summers here may be ridiculously hot, fall through spring is great!I am doing the AVA Centurion Challenge where walking club members walk 100 10k's throughout the year.  I have 90(!) more to do!  YikesIt's tough getting old.  We have palm trees that have grown so much that it isn't safe for hubby or I to climb a ladder that high to trim them, a treadmill upstairs that needs to be brought downstairs (and which weighs a ton), a toilet that needs to be replaced, an HVAC system that either needs major maintenance or replacement, and some electrical work that needs to be done.  Years ago, hubby and I would have easily done these things ourselves but now we pay people to do these things for us :/We checked out Sam's Club and it was just OK, kind of like what Costco would be like if Walmart was running it.  Sunday is National Coffee Day!  Here are some places you can get some great deals--even freebies--on coffee.And a last minute thing...the grandkids just called and want to go to Disney World for their birthdays (their birthdays are all in the same month).  I figured maybe we would gift them ticket until I checked the price...$172 PER PERSON for a two-day ticket!  Holy crap that's expensive and significantly more than the cost when the kids were little.  Needless to say their birthday gifts aren't going to be quite that extravagant!"},
{"title": "I Love Free Stuff!", "date": "Monday, September 16, 2019", "text": "Part of living frugally is finding cheap or even free things that you would otherwise have to pay for.  We are ridiculously frugal on most things so I am always on the look out for great deals, especially when it comes to things to keep up entertained.  Here's some great deals I've come across recently...Yesterday hubby and I went to a free community safety forum at the Mob Museum.  This month's topic was Emergency Preparedness and it was pretty informative.  These events are held once a month and it is a great way to #1, learn some useful safety information, #2, get a free entry to the Mob Museum after the forum (regularly priced at $17 for locals and $27 for non-locals), and #3, have some free drinks and snacks provided at the forum.Next Saturday we will use our free Museum Day tickets to go to the Atomic Testing Museum (regular price $22 each!).Saturday after next is free National Parks Entry Day.  Hubby already has a lifetime senior pass to enter national parks so we won't be going on that day (the parks tend to be crazy busy on these free days) but this is a great opportunity for people who don't already have a pass to go as some parks charge up to $35 per car as their regular entry fee.  On a related note, if you have a fourth grader, your family can get a free National Parks pass through this program.Every morning I take a quick look at the reddit freebies page to see if there are any free things available that I would be interested in.I also take an occasional look at the Class Action Rebates page to see if there is anything we qualify for.Tomorrow is TMobile Tuesday so I will of course check the app and see if there are any good freebies we can get.Last night hubby and I watched the Ken Burns documentary \"Country Music\" on PBS.  It was a fascinating show about the history of country music which was very cool (little did I know this was a 16 hour(!) documentary so I guess I will be watching the next seven episodes too!).  Anyway, when I saw the show was coming on I texted my friend and her husband who are big country music fans and told them to watch the show.  They said they don't have TV where they are living now, just internet, so I told them they can find the show free to stream on PBS or get an Over the Air antenna for their TV.  Moral of this story, there is often a free option for shows you want to watch, either via antenna or through one of the many online options.  As a last option, I think our library either has or will carry a video of this show and if they don't they are very good at ordering any movie that you want to check out from other libraries.I'm still working on the manifesting thing.  Each night before I go to sleep I watch a couple of videos on manifesting on YouTube.  Weirdly enough when I opened my mail yesterday a friend had sent me a receipt with a note that said \"I got you a Sam's Club membership, you can go to any store and pick it up\".  This was totally out of the blue and while I hadn't even been thinking about shopping or Sam's Club, this was a really nice and unexpected surprise!Finally, next weekend is the huge Life Is Beautiful Festival in downtown Las Vegas.  This is a very popular music and arts festival which draws thousands and thousands of attendees.  While I am not usually much for festivals (especially this one, I don't know a single music act...I think I'm getting old!), I am thinking about volunteering to help out at the event.  The cost to volunteer is $40 but then you get to enjoy the rest of the festival (I love the arts part) which most people pay $315 to attend.  I've done this before at conferences I have been interested in.  Instead of paying the full entry price, just volunteer to help out and you get to attend for free or for a very low price!"},
{"title": "100 Resources If You Are Flat Broke, Homeless, Jobless, Etc.", "date": "Saturday, September 14, 2019", "text": "I've written two popular posts on this topic, one way back in 2010(!) and an update in 2014.  It's been five years so I figured I would update this list of resources once again so that people in need would have this information all together on one list to help them out.The same caveats from the previous posts still apply, namely that I have never been homeless by circumstance (although we were technically homeless for a couple of years while we traveled which brought up some interesting issues such as trying to renew my driver's license when I didn't have an \"official\" address and the lady at the DMV insisting that I couldn't have a driver's license if I didn't have an address and me asking her how all of the homeless people who live in their cars can legally drive if they didn't have an actual house with an address and her rolling her eyes...hopefully the DMVs have addressed this issue but I don't know if they have and I don't have much faith that any government worker would go above and beyond to fix this issue but I digress...).  Also, this list is meant to be helpful but not a cure-all for homelessness.  If there was a way to fix homelessness there wouldn't be thousands and thousands of people living on the streets of all of our major cities in our country.  Homelessness is a many-faceted problem with, so far, very few options for \"fixing\".Another quick note--after revising this list it is amazing how far we have come since 2010 with internet resources which are super useful for the homeless and those in need!BasicsYou really do need ID to function in society these days.  For people who have lost or otherwise never had ID, getting a state ID card, driver's license, Social Security card, or passport is like a catch-22, basically you need ID in order to get ID which is where the problem lies.  Here is some info on how to go about getting official government ID if you don't currently have ID.  Also, homeless service agencies can often help people procure ID (everything from helping them contact their state's vital records office to providing an \"official\" address to receive mail at).A cell phone is pretty much required to function in society these days.  Cheap pre-paid cell phones can be found at Walmart and similar stores.  Cheap cell service can be found at Mint, Ting, and similar places.  Also, low income people can qualify for free cell service through the Lifeline program.  As a side note, even cell phones that aren't activated can still be used to call 911.  Also consider using Google Voice, Skype, and social media services like Facebook messenger, etc for your communication needs.Another necessity for modern life is an address where you can receive mail and other official documents.  Mailing addresses for the homeless could be a post office box or private mail box (these cost money and require an \"official\" home address when setting them up), using a (responsible!) friend or family member's address where you can receive mail, and some homeless service agencies let people use their address for mailing purposes.  Note that full-time RVers also have this issue; here is an overview of how they get around the mailing address problem.At the first sign that you will be losing your home/income, go to your local welfare office (Google welfare and the name of your state to find a local office) and sign up for any service/program you qualify for like TANF, WIC, food stamps (SNAP), emergency housing, unemployment, Medicare, etc.  Basically get as much help as you can, as quickly as you can, headed your way.  Sometimes housing lists are years long but sign up anyway as new programs and funding can sometimes change these circumstances with no notice.Another good resource for those in need is calling 211.  This is like 911 but it provides information on local social services that you can use like emergency housing or food resources.  Just call and tell them what kind of help you need and the operator can point you in the right direction.  You can also find 211 online here.Storage is another issue for the homeless.  Carrying around all of your worldly belongings can make you a target for robbery or theft so other options like renting a storage unit (expensive), storing stuff at a friend's house (iffy), renting a locker in a bus station or bowling alley, or even getting a safe deposit box for your most important papers should be considered.  Note that copies of ALL of your important documents like birth certificate, license, and passport, etc should be scanned and put on both a thumb drive you carry with you and stored in the cloud like in your email or free cloud storage service like OneDrive.If you can get a free checking/savings account, open a PayPal account, and/or get a credit card (linked to your bank or pre-paid), do so.  These services will give you a secure place to store your money, receive direct deposits to, and cash checks.  People also use places like Walmart and Western Union for these services but there is a fee with each transaction.  Here are some free banking resources; note some are online only.You also need gear if you are going to be homeless.  Even something as simple as a basic backpack and a couple changes of clothes and toiletries will be useful in order to take care of yourself.  Check the links further down the page on housekeeping for places where you can acquire this gear on the cheap.Get as much education as you can.  When you are homeless and in survival mode, this may be the last thing you are thinking about, but something as simple as getting a free GED (check your local community college for these classes) can open employment doors that would otherwise be closed to people with no basic education.  If there is a training course for those in need, grab it (check the Goodwill or your local employment office for these).  If you can get into JobCorps or the military, even better; you will be housed and fed and educated for free!A social network is also very useful for those in need.  Family, friends, and other people you can depend on to help you out when needed can be a lifesaver (note, these need to be positive people, not losers who will drag you down with them).  Do be agreeable and helpful, don't overstay your welcome or take advantage of people.FoodFind out where free hot meals are being served in your community and take advantage of this.  You need food to keep you active and healthy and free food is a great way to stay full on the cheap.Also find out where the food pantries in your area are located.  These places are designed for people in need and there is no shame in getting the food you need for free from these places as that is what they are there for.  Note that many food pantries can also provide baby items like formula and diapers as well as pet food.Stop by churches in your area and see what kind of resources they offer.  Some have food pantries, some serve hot meals, some provide gift cards for local stores, etc.Fast food places are often the \"go to\" for those who are hungry.  While you wouldn't want to eat there everyday since the food isn't that great for your health, the $1 menu can be a lifesaver if you are hungry.Dollar Stores and 99 Cent stores have popped up all over the place.  For only a few dollars, you can make some relatively healthy meals from the food sold at these places (rice, beans, etc).Don't forget to check out community events which sometimes provide free food and snacks for attendees.  Meetings like fire station open houses, community safety forums, and other meetings where the public are invited might serve everything from cookies and coffee to full meals.Dumpster diving for free food sounds kind of yucky but there is an entire movement dedicated to this way of sourcing free food.  Use online resources--from wikis to reddit to YouTube--to learn how to do this.Foraging for wild food and gleaning farmer's fields are also tried and true way to acquire free produce.  Again, the internet has tons of resources for how to do this in your area (wild edibles vary by region).Check out places that provide free food samples.  From using an old Costco card (you can get a complete meal at these stores on the weekend just from all the sample tables) to taking food factory tours and paying attention to samples at your local grocery store, you can eat pretty well this way.Also consider bartering for a free meal.  I've seen people exchange work with local farmers for free food or shelter to bartering things like window washing or cleaning up with local restaurant owners for free meals.ShelterFind out where your local homeless shelters are.  Some people live in these shelters, others wouldn't touch them with a 10-foot pole, but it is still a good idea to know where they are located in your city for times when you need a roof over your head.Squatting is another way to shelter yourself if you are homeless.  Note that squatting is usually illegal and can often be dangerous so do this at your own risk.Camping is another way that the homeless shelter themselves.  This can range from living in an official campground to finding an out of the way place to set up a tent.  Camping gear can be acquired from thrift stores or friends and this is a good way to keep the rain off you.  Note that camping in cities and towns can sometimes be illegal so do this at your own risk.  Here's a list of free and legal places to camp in the US.Couchsurfing is another way to shelter yourself.  This means sleeping on a friend's couch/in their guest room, for free.  Couchsurfing can also be done via an app where you stay for free with people who open their homes to couchsurfers (generally travelers) and traveling bicyclists through WarmShowers.It may be possible to trade for your room and board by becoming a live-in caretaker (babysitter or for the elderly), a farm worker (WWOOFing for example), or house sitter.If you have a car, this may be the best place to shelter yourself.  There are thousands and thousands of people living in their vehicles in the US either by choice, or necessity.  Know the local laws as they pertain to living in your car (it's illegal in some places), and learn the tricks and tips for doing this by hitting up the internet (YouTube is a goldmine of info on this topic, just search 'living in your car').Sometimes you can just ask for shelter.  Friends, family, and acquaintances may open their home to you if they know you need a place to stay for a while.  Some people have asked to stay in churches and have been allowed to do so, while others have asked farmers if they can set up in a tent on their property and have been granted permission to do this.There may be longer-term shelter options in your community like transitional housing programs, halfway houses, in-patient drug and mental health treatment facilities, etc.If you suddenly find yourself homeless, sometimes local organizations like shelters, the Red Cross, churches, etc. can offer vouchers for you to stay in a local hotel for a few days.  It doesn't hurt to ask if these vouchers are available in your area.Other unusual ways to shelter yourself include: living in a library, living in a mall, and living hidden in an attic.  Note that all of these things are illegal.Special CircumstancesIf you or your spouse has ever served in the military, check with your local VA office to see if you are entitled to any benefits that could help you.  Local military service agencies like DAVs, VFW halls, and local vet service centers (example here) can also be helpful in this regard.If you are fleeing from an abusive situation, your local domestic violence shelter can help provide food, housing, and other resources until you can get back on your feet.  If you are a registered member of an Indian Tribe, check with your reservation's services office and see what kind of help they can provide (everything from medical services to food and housing may be available).If you are a senior citizen, check and see what kind of help you can receive in your community.  Everything from Medicare and Social Security payments to senior housing and Meal on Wheels and more may be available to you.If you are a minority, check to see what resources may be available to help you in your community (examples here, here, and here).If you are an immigrant, see what resources are available to help you in your community (this can include everything from lawyers and translators to help with legal issues to free English classes at your local library).If you are a teenager who has become homeless, use Google to find local and national teen homeless resources in help you out.  Be sure to also seek assistance at your school (many schools have food pantries and clothing donation centers for students in need) as well as from social services if necessary (some parents literally kick their teenagers out of the house which is illegal).If you are disabled, find out what resources are available in your community.  Everything from Social Security disability payments to a higher spot on housing lists to free or reduced transit passes is often available to those in need who are also disabled.If you are a college student, check with student services to see what kinds of resources your school provides.  There are A LOT of homeless college students these days and many schools have stepped up to help them with food pantries and all kinds of other programs to meet their needs.If you are homeless with your children, find out what kind of services are available in your community.  These can range from federal benefits like TANF and free school meal programs (even during the summer) to housing programs and free daycare.MedicalSee if your community offers free or sliding scale medical clinics.Also pay attention to free health fairs in your community.  These are particularly common for back to school events for kids and homeless outreach clinic days for those who cannot afford to pay for medical care.If you have a medical emergency, go to your local hospital ER.  ERs have to treat you even if you can't pay.  Note that you will get bills for treatment afterwards but you can always ask the hospital if they have a charity care program which can lower or even erase the bills you owe.See what free and cheap services your local health district offers (example here).  This can range from free immunizations and car seats to free mammograms and pap smears for women who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford these services.If you need prescription medicine for a chronic medical condition, check out the variety of ways to get the medication you need for cheap or even free.  There are free prescription programs, you can ask your doctor for free prescription samples, Walmart offers reduced-price medications at their pharmacies, and people can buy prescriptions at Costco even if they aren't a member.If you qualify, sign up for Medicare/Medicaid.  These programs are specifically for seniors and low income people.  While Medicare is a national program that all seniors qualify for, Medicaid qualifications vary by state.Consider medical and dental schools for free and reduced cost care.  Yes, you will be taken care of by students while they \"practice\" on you, but they are always overseen by their professors who are qualified doctors (example here).Check into Planned Parenthood for free and low cost medical and reproductive services such as birth control, pap smears, etc.Keeping yourself in excellent physical shape is perhaps one of the best ways to avoid the need for medical and dental care.  Eat right, exercise daily, cut out bad habits like smoking and drinking, and preventive care like having your teeth cleaned every six months instead of waiting years until your teeth are rotting out before seeking care, can all do wonders to keep you out of the doctor's or dentist's office.Finally, there are a number of unusual ways people have sought inexpensive medical and dental services including: medical and dental tourism, using animal prescriptions for humans, and joining medical trials for free medical care.TransportationWalking is often the transit mode of choice for the homeless.  It is free and the only thing you need are a good pair of shoes.Next on the scale of inexpensive transportation options is using a bicycle.  A bicycle will require the initial cost to purchase it (you can find these cheap on Craigslist or at thrift stores), plus maintenance and upkeep (there are lots of good DIY videos on YouTube about this), and of course the ability to safely ride a bike and keep it secured from theft.Public transit is a great way to get all around your city for very low cost.  Note that low income people, seniors, and students can often get free or reduced-cost transit passes.  Also check for vouchers for free transit passes provided by social service agencies in your area.If you need to travel further from home, there are many low-cost bus services which are very popular among travelers.  These include Megabus, Bolt Bus, Flix bus, and GoTo bus.  Note that areas with large Hispanic or Asian populations often have low cost \"no-name\" bus services which you can find by asking around.Check out your local Craigslist and reddit bulletin boards to find free or cheap ride shares is that is a way you are comfortable traveling.Hitchhiking and train hopping are free and are about as old as cars and trains.  The safety and legality of these modes of transportation, however, may be questionable so do this at your own risk.Cars can be both transportation and shelter and there are thousands of people who are currently living in their vehicles.  On the one hand, cars are expensive to buy and maintain and you need to keep up on all legal requirements (valid driver's license, registration, insurance, etc) in order to avoid fines and tickets, on the other hand, cars are safer and more secure than just sleeping on the streets.Not that many people in need are going to be hopping a plane but if you need to go a long distance fast, consider cheap airlines like Spirit, Allegiant, and Jet Blue (use Google flights to find the lowest cost airline tickets by day).Motorcycles and mopeds are a good option between bicycling and driving a car.  They are cheaper to buy, maintain, and cheaper for gas and registration, as well as much faster than a bicycle.  Be sure to learn how to drive safely and always wear appropriate safety gear like a helmet.Carpooling, ride-shares, Uber, Lyft, etc. are another form of inexpensive transportation.  Uber and Lyft are usually cheaper than taxis, and some jobs provide free or inexpensive car-pooling and van pools for employees. IncomeIf you qualify, consider using government-funded programs to both provide an income as well as teach you viable job skills.  Programs like JobCorps and apprenticeships are great ways to earn while you learn.Years ago the military was open to basically anyone with a pulse.  These days the military is more choosy about who they allow to join but this is still a good option for many people.  The military provides great benefits and job training as well as housing, medical care, and food.Panhandling and busking are quick ways to earn quick cash.  These activities may or may not be legal where you are so plan accordingly to stay out of legal trouble.Bartering is another way to get what you need, using what you have.  Whether you are trading your skills, time, labor, or material items, this is an interesting way to acquire what you need without actually paying cash for it.Earning an income from your online activities or app use is a very viable way to earn money these days.  You can Google for ideas and come up with lots of info like this.If you have worked at all in the past, take advantage of any ways you can turn this into money for you (ie: file for unemployment if you have been laid off, be sure to file your taxes and get the money you are owed from the government, if you were injured on the job file for unemployment disability, take any resources offered if you are laid off, participate in job retraining programs if you qualify, etc).Day labor is a quick way to earn cash.  Many of these places will pay you each day for the hours you work and have very minimal requirements (showing up early in the morning is the most obvious one).Google for ways to earn quick cash.  You will find thousands and thousands of pages on this topic and suggestions will range from walking dogs to selling blood and everything in between.Use your trash picking and dumpster diving skills to find things you can clean up and resell on platforms like Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Offer Up, etc.A side note, avoid things like scams and opportunities that sound too good to be true as well as doing things that are illegal and will get you a quick trip to jail like burglary, theft, prostitution, drug dealing, etc.HousekeepingUse your local library for all the free resources they provide from loaner books and movies to educational classes and social services (or even just a cool place to sit during the hottest days of the summer).  Libraries are one of the very best resources for those in need.Shop thrift stores, especially on half-price days.  You can pretty much find anything you need at a thrift store for a fraction of the cost of a new item.Speaking of thrift stores, many of these organizations that also provide services for the homeless and jobless including resume writing, job training, and even jobs so be sure to take advantage of these services if they are offered in your community.Staying clean is another challenge when one is homeless.  Some people buy monthly passes to national gym chains so they have daily access to showers.  The community pool is generally a cheap place to take a shower, as are truck stops, parks facilities, and some homeless service centers.  The old fashioned way of using a public water source like a lake or river to bathe will work too.Keeping your clothes clean can also be a challenge.  Laundromats are the most common place to do laundry, doing laundry at a friend's place is another option, and some homeless service centers offer free laundry facilities.  Hand washing and hanging your clothes to dry is also an option.Just because you are homeless or broke, doesn't mean you should never have any fun.  Check local Facebook pages, local reddit pages, and online news and entertainment sites to find free and low cost entertainment opportunities.  Volunteering can also score you some free entertainment.  Generally you provide a few hours of work at a conference or festival and you will get to stay for the rest of the day to enjoy the event for free.Keeping your stuff in good repair is a good way to extend the life of your gear and clothing and it's much cheaper than re-buying the items.  Keep a small sewing kit and some duct tape on hand to make quick repairs to your gear and clothing.When you need things--from clothes and shoes to household goods and work supplies--check out Freecycle, Craigslist free items, and ask on social media sites like Facebook and reddit; free is better than spending money on items people are only too happy to give away.Many homeless service centers, shelters, churches, even free meal programs will provide free clothing, shoes, and hygiene items to those in need just for asking.Remember the mantra \"reduce, reuse, recycle, or do without\".  People throw so many things out that are still in great condition.  Having minimal, quality items and keeping them in good repair, as well as recycling used items is a good way to have the things you need on the cheap.Long-Term FixesIf part of the reason you are in a bad situation is due to drug or alcohol addiction, consider joining free treatment services like NA and AA.  Other addiction treatment programs may be available as part of a doctor-ordered or court-ordered treatment program.Do not get into debt.  If you are in debt, check out Dave Ramsey for advice on how to get out of debt.  Things like payday lenders, credit cards, rent to own places, and worse, the local loan shark, are the quickest way to keep you down and keep you from getting out of a bad situation.If you have legal problems, make sure to take care of these issues ASAP.  Check with your local free legal aid office for help and ask to do community service or jail days in lieu of paying fines or tickets...the last thing you want if you are already living on the streets is warrants and other problems with the law following you around.While I usually never recommend going into debt, if you have the ability (like a diploma or GED and good SAT scores) you might consider taking out student loans for college or certification programs which will help you to get a good job in the future.  Note that scholarships are way better than loans and, as of right now, student loans will follow you until you die since they are not dischargable in bankruptcy.Apply for any and every job you can find.  Even if it is a low-paying crap job it is better than no job (usually).  For some reason it is easier to get another, better job if you are already employed.  Also some jobs have additional benefits like free meals when you work, all the coffee you can drink, etc.Avoid the law if at all possible.  This includes everything from not breaking the law (like vandalism or squatting), getting tickets or fines you can't pay, driving without insurance, not having kids you can't support, not paying court-ordered child support, or hanging with people who routinely commit crimes.  Courts, trials, probation, jail and prison time...all of those things you DON'T want in your life.Volunteer.  If you aren't doing anything anyway, volunteering can be a great way to get free things (like a free meal when volunteering at a meal program), is a great addition to your resume (it shows you can be dependable and work), and it's a great way to network in the community (I've hired several people I met when they were volunteering through various charities I was working with).Cut out vices if you can.  Drinking, smoking, drugs...these things are expensive, sometimes illegal, and do nothing to really benefit your life.Seek assistance for problems that keep you in a downward cycle.  If mental health issues are the problem, seek out resources for treatment.  If a loser SO is the problem, kick them out and move on.  If the people you hang out with are causing you problems, find better friends.See if there is a listing or directory of homeless services in your area.  Many communities produce these sorts of lists which include all services you may need in your area (example here).Know your legal rights.  The poorest and most downtrodden in our society are often taken advantage of because they don't now their rights.  The ACLU has several general 'Know your Rights' pamphlets.Reddit is a wonderful online community where you can ask for pretty much anything from legal and medical advice to general assistance to tech support.Safety is of top concern, especially if you are homeless.  Take extra caution to avoid dangerous people and situations.Move.  Often people feel stuck in a bad situation (bad home life, high unemployment area, living in a dangerous area, living in an area you can no way afford, etc) but one simple way to fix this is to pick up and move to a new area.  Obviously it is a precarious situation to just do this but the payoff may be much greater than staying stuck where you are.If you still have a home but can't afford your utilities check with each utility company (electric, gas, internet, trash, water, sewer, etc) and see what kind of assistance programs they offer.  Many electric companies provide free or discounted electric service to people in need during the winter as well as free weatherization programs.  There are very inexpensive internet programs for low income folks.  The gas company may have rebates or discount programs, etc.If you have children, sign them up for any free program they qualify for.  Free school lunches, free school supplies, free medical care, free dental care, free vaccinations, free parks programs, even free haircuts at back to school events and free weekend/summer meal programs.  There are so many free programs and services for children in most communities that it pays to take advantage of every program you can for your kids.Tech tips: get a free email address since many things like job applications are now done online instead of in person (GMail, Hotmail, Yahoo mail, etc).  Find free wifi in your community instead of paying for it.  Keep all of your important documents backed up on a memory card or thumb drive.  Utilize the library for free internet/free computers to use/free computer classes/etc.  Cancel cable and use an over-the-air antenna to get free TV.Google for general homeless resources and see what you can find.  I did just that and found this, this, this, and this.Work together with other people in your situation to help everyone out.  Share babysitting with other mothers in need, go together to buy a 50 pound bag of rice and share it (this is much cheaper than buying smaller quantities), share housing if possible, etc.Do something out of the ordinary to achieve out of the ordinary results.  For example, this man was homeless, he wrote a book about his situation, and now he is a famous author.  This kid was an orphan so he asked for a family when he went to church and now has one.  J K Rowling was jobless and penniless but she started writing and...well you know how that story ends."},
{"title": "10 Quick Money Tips", "date": "Thursday, September 12, 2019", "text": "Some random money tips...Museum Day Live is Saturday after next; there is still time to get your free museum tickets.This is the last big \"tech hype\" season of the year.  There have been several new Samsung releases in the past month and Apple announced several new products last week.  Bottom line, there is a lot of cool, new, expensive tech to think about for the upcoming holidays.  On the other hand, there is something to be said for being a late tech adopter.Here's a dream gig: this company will pay you $1000 to drink coffee for a month!An interesting article I recently came across...universities are now housing seniors (as in senior citizens) on campus.  This helps schools earn money and seniors save money so it's kind of a win-win for everyone.Another unusual deal...move to Italy, collect $27,000!We are working on the daughter's upcoming wedding a bit at a time.  So far the venue and minister are set and paid for, and the dinner has been booked.  The SIL set up a Zola account for the couple (some sort of online registry), and no one was excited to do the invitations so I did it myself, literally.  Wedding invitations are ridiculously expensive (I checked several sources, apparently they jack the price up on anything to do with weddings!) so I hopped on the computer, created a nice invitation with Publisher software and a few of their photos, then bought some printer ink (I haven't used my printer in ages since it is cheaper to just print off stuff I need at Office Depot) and printed out 100 color invitations on a nice quality, cream colored paper.  Hubby folded, I did mailing labels, we added stamps, and \"ta da\" that part is completely finished.  The tablet I put so much effort into finding last month?  It went back to Costco (I love their generous return policy).  I found that I was using it way too much, mostly for ingesting social media stuff like reddit and YouTube, when I really should be doing more productive stuff.  So while I still have my old tablet, I find that I don't use it as much and have come out of my vegetative state to work on things that may become money-earning ventures.On our local grocery store app this week--free eggs!  Not a big deal but free stuff is free stuff.  I make it a point to check the app each week before we go shopping just to make sure we aren't missing any free or deeply discounted stuff.I love reading stories of how people got out of debt.  Usually I can find a good tip or two that I can use myself!Finally, while I am not much for politics, Elizabeth Warren's plan to expand Social Security sounds like a great idea to me."},
{"title": "Saving Money With Apps", "date": "Sunday, September 8, 2019", "text": "I am not a big app user.  I bought my cell phone because it had a nice camera and fast processor but I don't use my phone for gaming or photo editing or anything besides reading the news and checking email.  A couple weeks ago, however, I saw a post on a deals website about the TMobile Tuesday app and the great deal the person had got with the app so I decided to check it out.We have TMobile for our cell service but I figured using the app would just be a hassle.  But I downloaded the TMobile Tuesday app and I am really glad I did!  Every Tuesday I check the app and it gives users deals on a variety of things.  A couple weeks ago I got $2 off my drink at Baskin Robbins.  Last week we (I put the app on hubby's phone too) each got a free Whopper at Burger King (yes, I pulled the meat off and ate a veggie sandwich :) then we stopped by the local TMobile store and we each got a free hat.Then I downloaded the Albertsons app for our local grocery store.  I had tried this app when it was new and it was clunky and basically useless but lately, every week, the store ad has had some really good specials you can only get when you use the app...So I relented and I am really glad I decided to try the app again.  This week, using the app (again, I put the app on both of our phones for double the deals) we got the following great deals at our local grocery store: a watermelon for $4.50, two boxes of Cheerios for 25 cents each, organic ketchup was free as a bonus on hubby's app (not on mine, no idea why not), eggs for 67 cents a dozen, a dollar off almond milk, spaghetti for 50 cents, and the regular sale price on the coffee creamer and cheese (you can use the app for these sale prices or the coupons in the ad flyer).  The app-only specials are really really good deals!We got all of this for a total of $22!On a side note, I do occasionally use the Starbucks app.  If you load money on the app and use the app to pay for your drink, you will collect \"stars\" which can be redeemed for free drinks and other Starbucks items.Do you know of any other great money-saving apps?"},
{"title": "Saving Money at the Goodwill", "date": "Saturday, September 7, 2019", "text": "Whenever we need to buy something, the first place we check is the Goodwill.  Last week hubby's coffee pot got a crack in it so instead of running to a department store and buying a fancy (read, expensive) coffee maker, we hit up the Goodwill (on Wednesday which is 40% off for seniors, of course).  Hubby found a perfectly nice, and actually pretty new looking coffee maker for only $4! And since my walking club was going to have our first walk of the season this weekend, I got a nice outfit for walking which included a new looking RBX jacket and new looking Nike athletic pants for a grand total of $5.00 for both pieces.  I love the Goodwill!"},
{"title": "I Need a Long-Term Plan", "date": "Tuesday, September 3, 2019", "text": "Last night hubby was feeling awful and after much debate we decided to wait and see if we should go to the hospital.  He didn't feel like the last few times when he had cardiac issues, rather he thought it was just indigestion (he ate a ridiculous amount of goat at our favorite Indian restaurant for lunch earlier in the day).  After a few hours--and endless questions from me \"are you OK?\" \"are you suuurrreee you are OK?\" \"should we go now? Now?? Now???\" \"should I call an ambulance?\"--he felt much better so disaster averted. My thoughts, in addition to the constant questioning to make sure he just had indigestion and not a heart-related issue which he has had in the past, was that if he suddenly dies, I would be screwed (I tend to analyze potential disaster situations from all angles and for hours on end).  I know that in theory he will go before me--he is 20 years older than I am and mortality data for men vs women being what it is and all--but I would like him to live to at least 90ish.  OTOH, I've known way too many people who have died unexpectedly, leaving their spouse to deal with facing the world alone, in a precarious financial position, with perilous long-term prospects.  Yikes.  We have been like Siamese twins for more than 30 years (working together, traveling together, always being together pretty much) and he is my favorite person in the entire world and mostly my life revolves around him and he seems invincible and while we are, for practical purposes ready for either of us to die (Will and other legal documents are up to date and such), in theory is one thing, in actuality it would be disastrous I think.So my long-term plan for if hubby dies before me needs to address the following:I don't have a monthly income.  I do gig work and random freelance work but I don't have a job and benefits and financial stability on my own.  Hubby receives his military pension which will stop at his death (we didn't choose to pay the huge monthly fees which would allow his pension to go to me after his death) and he also receives Social Security (which would also stop at his death as I won't be old enough to draw Social Security for more than a decade from now).We stopped hubby's military life insurance as the monthly cost of this nearly tripled when he turned 70 and the amount of the insurance decreased by half :(We have significant equity in our house and our house payments are really small but the house isn't paid off yet.  Getting our house paid off should be one of our top priorities.I am also still making payments on our car.  This should be paid off within a year or so but getting it paid off ASAP would be better.I also have a credit card that needs to be paid off.  While the monthly payments are small, the fewer bills I would have to cover on a monthly basis, the better.On a happy note, I have very low cost military medical insurance for life even if hubby dies (or at least until I get remarried which I have no plans to do, like, ever.  The things one thinks about in the middle of the night!  eeekkk).We have some money in savings but obviously, having lots and lots of money in savings would be better.We need to do some repairs to our house.  The HVAC system is getting towards the end of its lifespan, a couple of appliances need to be replaced, and hubby tends to do any repairs needed (me, on my own, DIYing stuff with the help of YouTube videos would probably be disastrous).So basically, the thing most needed for long-term survival after a spouse dies, is money.  No surprise there but I think most people don't think of all of the financial ramifications of the death of the family breadwinner until after the fact when it is too late to do much but panic.  I don't want to end up in that position (I'm sure I would be quite the basket case anyway, for quite a long time, should anything happen to him) so it just makes sense to prepare for a financial future alone now when I am in a good place rather than after the fact (but I will still hope he lives until 90!).So my purpose going forward is to ensure my financial solvency no matter what happens.  I need some steady sources of income, to get rid of as many bills as possible, to hammer away at savings, and to get our house in ship shape condition.  This entire topic is scary and sad an awful..."},
{"title": "How I Research a New Purchase...To Death", "date": "Wednesday, August 28, 2019", "text": "This is my new tablet. It is a Galaxy Tab S5e and so far I love it!  In fact I am writing this blog post from my new tablet (doable but much slower than on my laptop!).I've been looking for a new tablet for a while. My Tab S2 was amazing but I had it since 2015 and the battery life was declining daily (it was lucky to last four hours on a charge).  What I really wanted was a high powered 8 inch tablet with a fast processor and lots of memory. So I started to research. And research some more.The best tablets, IMHO, are from Samsung. I am a huge Android fan, and really don't like Apple products, so Samsung it is.  After hours of online research and watching copious YouTube review videos, I finally went to Best Buy to check out the tablets they had in stock.  Unfortunately there are no high end 8 inch tablets on the market now (Apple has the 8 inch iPad mini 5 which is apparently a great device if you are an Apple fan, and Huawei has a well reviewed 8 inch tablet but I was worried about what would happen to it after the ban against Chinese tech products goes into affect in a few months).At the store I decided I really liked the S5e tablet, it seemed pretty fast and was amazingly thin and light so even though it was a 10 inch tablet, carrying it around with me everyday wouldn't be much heavier than carrying the 8 inch tablet.So back home I went to research prices (I told you I tend to research things to death). I checked prices at all the online stores (Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart,  B & H, etc), as well as prices for the device at military stores, open box deals, and Costco. It turns out Costco had the best price ($429 versus $479 at all the other stores for the 6gig/128GB with a bonus 128GB memory card) so off I went to Costco to buy it. Besides saving money over the price of the tablet at other stores, Costco also has an amazing return policy if I decide I don't like it.After a few days of use, I still really like it. The extra screen real estate is nice, I ordered a great tablet cover from Amazon for it for $12, it charges really fast, and I have yet to use up all of the battery even using the tablet for an entire day and evening. The screen is amazing and the sound is amazing too, the only downside for some people would be that it doesn't have a headphone jack (it comes with a dongle for the jack in the box) but I have some inexpensive wireless earbuds which work great with it that doesn't physically teather me to the device which I really like. Galaxy will release the Tab S6 next week which is supposed to be the exact same size and weight as this tablet. It will have a faster processor chipset and be better, spec-wise, than this tablet but after considering this, and the extra cost (the new tablet will run around $650), I decided that it wasn't worth it to me to have a marginally faster tablet and the included S pen which I don't use anyway.So that's how I tend to consider every new purchase. Do I really need it, are there other alternatives, what will for my needs, do I need the very best item or will OK work well for me, which store had the best price, can I find review videos to get other people's opinions on the item, etc. Ad nauseum."},
{"title": "An Update in 10 Points...Because It's Been a Long Week", "date": "Friday, August 23, 2019", "text": "I jut realized it's been more than a week since I posted here!  Anyway, it's been a busy week or so...here's what's been happening...We got our tickets for Museum Day and decided on the National Atomic Testing Museum.  Total cost for Museum Day tickets--$0.  Regular cost for tickets--$44 for both of us.  Needless to say this is a great deal!Hubby's daughter is getting married here in Vegas. She's been with her boyfriend for 30 years (!) so while this isn't like a big first wedding, and while their only plan was just to come here and get married, everyone has been pretty wishy washy with actual plans.  Finally I made an executive decision, booked the wedding (package for limo, photos, flowers, minister, venue, etc was only $500) then booked the dinner for the group at a nice buffet (about $1500 for everyone) and told her we would pay for the whole thing ($2000 for an entire wedding seems like an extreme bargain to me). Everyone, including the bride and groom, is happy with the plan and even happier that hubby and I are picking up the tab.Oddly enough, after pulling the wedding stuff together yesterday and deciding we would just take the money out of our savings to pay for it, I watched this video on YouTube last night and focused my attention on somehow paying for this wedding without taking money out of savings if at all possible.  This morning a friend called and asked if I still built websites.  I said yes, kind of (I haven't been focusing on this as a business for some years but I still do small projects), she said a friend of hers needed a website built for his business and some social media stuff put together and he had plenty of money to pay (she didn't even ask for a discount for him).  If I want the project, I've got it.  So of course I agreed and am putting together a proposal and some demo work tonight for him.  Ca-ching!  I think the wedding will be easily paid off and I think this law of attraction stuff works! I saw the new Galaxy Note 10 Plus and I love it!  Although I don't love the $1099 price tag.  Hopefully there will be some great deals later in the year, maybe around Black Friday.  I never pay retail for anything so I will have to wait and be patient for the price to come down quite a bit.I just found this website/app, Pluto TV, which allows you to watch TV for free on your computer, tablet, or cell phone.  There are commercials but there are so many channels with lots and lots of movies, sports, and TV shows to watch--it's pretty cool!Our president is deranged.  Who, in their right mind, thinks they can just buy Greenland???  And don't even get me started on the tariff war with China.You can get paid to binge-watch Friends.  I've never even watched one episode of the show (and pretty much completely missed the entire 1990s when it comes to TV and sitcoms) so I wouldn't be a good person to do this but maybe you would be interested.Entry to all National Parks is free this Sunday!I'm looking into other social media avenues.  Facebook is kind of meh (and totally invasive when it comes to privacy).  I haven't used Twitter in ages.  I do post pictures on Tumbler, and have this blog as well as a few others which I have been slacking off on updating but since I've been watching YouTube quite a bit lately, the idea of starting a YouTube channel is now a possibility.  Maybe.  I'm rather good at interviewing on TV (I've done it a few times in the past for news shows), I'm rather awful at video editing (I've tried it, I don't do it well).  But the lucrative aspect of it (you need LOTS of subscribers and people to watch your videos) is very much peaking my imagination!We had an earthquake yesterday!  Much like what happened a couple of months ago, I didn't actually feel the earthquake but I felt dizzy and nauseous for a few minutes then it passed.  I checked social media a few minutes later and sure enough, there had been an earthquake that quite a few people in our city felt!"},

{"title": "10 Ways We Saved Money Today", "date": "Friday, August 9, 2019", "text": "It was a pretty typical day today and like most days, we did quite a few things to save a little extra money with each thing we did...Hubby had a check up with his cardiologist (all is well!).  So for people in the military who have been in 10-15 years and they are thinking they can't hack another few years until they can retire, suck it up and do it!!  We have literally saved over a half million dollars over the past few years with several ER visits, a few invasive cardiac procedures, a boatload of medications, and many many follow-up appointments.  Thanks to the military and free health coverage for life, we haven't had to pay a single dollar for all of this healthcare!Hubby is participating in an annual military bowling tournament this week.  Part of this event is the opportunity to buy a bowling ball for $100.  Every couple of years hubby will buy a new bowling ball through this tournament so instead of ordering a new ball online at the full price of $174.99, he got a brand new ball for $100!When deciding where to get this new ball drilled, we asked the price of drilling at the tournament and they said it would cost $50.  We decided to go downstairs to the bowling center's regular pro shop and found that the price to drill the ball there was only $40 so we saved $10 just by checking both drilling places.Next hubby wanted to try out his new bowling ball, so grabbing the coupon book that one of the major casino groups sent out full of discounts and freebies at the beginning of summer, I pulled out a coupon for two free games of bowling at a local bowling center.  Total cost for bowling, $0!Of course, since we planned to be out and about all day, before we left the house I put our drinks in our insulated drink containers and made a couple of sandwiches and off we went.  Cost of eating out for breakfast and lunch, $0!During our travels today, we needed to get gas.  Besides choosing a cheaper gas station (Arco) we also paid cash which saved 10 cents off per gallon over the cost of using a credit card to pay.Hubby wanted to play poker for a couple of hours this afternoon so he went to one of his favorite poker rooms which not only comps him $1 per hour of play, they also have a free self-serve coffee bar so he could get free coffee and not have to tip a server.In the evening we debated eating dinner at home or eating out.  We decided to eat at the casino buffet and, grabbing the same coupon book that we used earlier, we used a buy one buffet, get one buffet free coupon for dinner.  The dinner cost $16.99 for both of us but we used hubby's comps to cover the cost of the buffet so the cost of dinner was a total of $4 for the tip we left the waiter.While hubby was playing poker, I fired up my tablet and watched YouTube videos.  There are a bajillion videos on multiple streams of income, how to make money online, and other similar topics.  Cost of this education is free, and hopefully I will use some of these things I learned today to make some side income in the future.We make it a habit when we leave the house each morning to turn up the AC to 85 degrees.  This is better than turning the AC completely off, yet it also saves money over leaving the AC at the usual 77 degrees that we set it on when we are home.  This probably only saves pennies per day but savings is savings."},
{"title": "My Everyday Carry (EDC) Bag", "date": "Thursday, August 8, 2019", "text": "We are on the go all the time.  Nearly everyday, even though we don't work, we leave the house in the morning and don't return until evening.  Usually we go to hubby's bowling league, the casino so hubby can play poker, to my walking club get-togethers, to community events, to some sort of attraction (there are lots of these around Las Vegas!), or to events at friend's homes.  Sometimes we hit all of these things in one day!Since we always have to be ready for anything, in particular not being home and having access to our stuff for hours on end, I tend to carry everything with me that we may need.  Here's what I carry...Kipling Go Seoul Small daypack (it's the perfect size and has a padded compartment for my tablet or laptop)Pepper spray (hanging on the daypack)Contigo insulated bottle (we bring our own drinks instead of buying them every day, best of all these bottles don't leak and keep drinks hot or cold for more than 10 hours)Not shown--Galaxy S8 cell phone (I took the picture with the phone)Lunch (we always bring containers of snacks, sandwiches, or meals depending on how long we intend to be gone, again, so we don't have to eat out every day)Kleenex packetKeysSunglassesFisher Space Pen (so tiny and works great!)Charging cord with a tip so I can charge via USB-A (tablet) and USB-C (cell phone)Suntan lotion (I tend to walk a lot when we are out, even during the high heat of summer)Wallet with ID and two debit cards from different banks$100 emergency cashTiny folding shopping bag (when I walk I sometimes do my shopping along the way and what won't fit into my daypack I can carry in the bag)Galaxy Tab S2 (I LOVE this tablet and use it everyday but the battery doesn't hold a charge for long and it is slowing down so I am looking for a new one.  If I have a lot of work to do on the computer I will bring my Galaxy Book 10 inch laptop instead of the tablet).Spork (I have a long spork so I always have an eating utensil with me to eat the lunch we take from home with)Umbrella (necessary for walking outside in the summer or winter to keep the weather off me)Battery bankTiny REI towelGreen bag is stuff for hubby (two days worth of prescription medication, glucose tabs, mints, cough drops)Colorful bag (includes lipstick, eyeliner, tampons)Blue bag is empty, it's what I use to carry all of the small items shown including:Pocket knifeEarbudsMini sharpieTiny flashlightTiny glowsticksNail clippersCoinsTiny super glueMatchesNail fileUSB drive with all of my files backed up on itWet WipeEarbudsPair of Nitrile gloves in a tiny ziplocSticky notesA mini ziploc bag with floss, Tylenol packet, bandaids, Motrin packet, condom (for an emergency tourniquet)Some of these items are things I use everyday like the earbuds and tablet but most of the items are to use during an emergency.  I've been in a big building when the power went out and there was no light at all thus the flashlight.  I use my pocketknife for all kinds of things (I even put a desk together with it once!).  With so many mass shootings going on, the gloves/towel/tampons/condom can be used to \"Stop the Bleed\", if my house were to burn down while we were gone I wouldn't have my main laptop anymore but I religiously back up my files every week on my USB drive so I could always get a new laptop and be good to go again.  I've lots count of how many times I have given my first aid kit items--bandaid, Tylenol, etc--to people who needed them.  And Wet Wipes are always useful."},

{"title": "Meanwhile in Las Vegas...", "date": "Wednesday, July 31, 2019", "text": "...some interesting (and weird and shocking) money things courtesy of our Las Vegas news stations...I told you about the invasion of the grasshoppers (which is still ongoing by the way) and this clever lady had an interesting answer to the problem...she collected some up and cooked them!  I'm really picky about food, to the point that I rarely even eat meat, but in many places I've been in Asia, fried grasshoppers are a treat.From the Las Vegas Advisor...Vegas has some super spendy restaurant meals! SFGate.com, the San Francisco Chronicle's website, has a slideshow of the \"craziest fanciest high-rollers-only meals\" in Las Vegas, featuring a number of the most expensive meals at 14 restaurants. Highest priced are the 12-ounce A5 Kobe steak at Prime Steakhouse at Bellagio ($720), the seven-course Japanese A5 Wagyu dinner at Red Plate at the Cosmo ($688 per person), the Krug's Chef's Table dinner at Restaurant Guy Savoy ($650 per person), the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall Soup (Japanese abalone, sea cucumber, and other very expensive ingredients, $498) at Red Plate, and the degustation menu at Joel Robuchon ($445 per person). The list also highlights Zuma at the Cosmopolitan (premium omakase for $168), SW Steahouse at the Wynn (tomahawk chop for $130), NoMad Restaurant at Park MGM (32-ounce 80-day dry-aged rib eye, $150), Mott 32 at the Venetian (Japanese A5 Kobe beef, $148), Jean George Steakhouse at Aria (42-ounce Wagyu tomahawk, $265), Bazaar Meat at the Sahara (caviar flight, $350), Morimoto Las Vegas at MGM Grand (54-ounce tomahawk ribeye, $170), Bavette's at Park MGM (seafood tower, $210), and the comparatively wimpy 24-ounce bone-in rib eye for two, $110) at Aureole at Mandalay Bay.  A couple days later they added this: To the 14 most expensive restaurant meals in Las Vegas (see our Vegas News item from July 27), we can now add the new number one: a $1,000 filet mignon covered with gold leaf and served with caviar and Krug Grande Cuvee Brut Champagne, according to Eater Las Vegas. It's available, with 48 hours notice, at Mr Chow on the second floor of Caesars Palace, with a view of the pool area. On a personal note, today I finally filed a Homestead Declaration.  I'd never heard of such a thing where we used to live but apparently it is a popular option for homeowners in Las Vegas.  For a filing fee of $40 a homeowner can file a simple form and automatically protect the equity in their home (up to $550,000) from any sort of legal judgement.  On a related note, I just got my annual property tax statement for my home.  Because of the tax cap, instead of paying around $2400 for my annual property tax bill, I only pay around $1200 because of the tax cap!  Thank goodness for the tax cap which protects homeowners from swiftly increasing property tax bills (which happens when either higher taxes are instituted and/or quickly rising home prices increase the value of your home)."},
{"title": "10 Money-Savvy Back to School Tips", "date": "Sunday, July 28, 2019", "text": "It's weird to be writing about back to school stuff when it is still July but there are many places, my city included, where school starts super early, like by mid-August!  So while that seems extremely early to me, I guess it is never too early to save money on back-to-school stuff for the kids...Hit up a back-to-school fair or two.  There have been a few city-wide back-to-school fairs in our area with several more planned for the next couple of weeks.  These are great places to get school info, maybe get your kid a free haircut and free school supplies, and even get required vaccinations during some of these events.Start shopping for school supplies now.  I've already picked up some school supplies like notebooks and crayons for really cheap (notebooks were only 10 cents!).  If you start now and shop loss leaders each week, you can get quite a few necessary school supplies for your kids at dirt cheap prices.  Side note, buy double the school supplies then hide half--this way you will have brand new school supplies to give your kids when they go back to school after Christmas break.Do all of the paperwork for school ASAP.  Things like registering your kids for school, finding out what bus they will ride, signing them up for before and after school care, etc. is much better to do way ahead of time rather than the day before school starts.Think about lunch now.  Now is the time to sign your kids up for free or reduced school lunches or if you plan to make their lunch everyday, gather the supplies and start practicing.  Things like thermoses and insulated lunch bags can often be found on sale now (especially at Walmart and Ross).  Also practice making them lunches like you intend to send with them to school now; this is a great way to determine what they like and don't like.Shop the Goodwill!  You can buy the bulk of your kid's back-to-school clothes at the Goodwill and other thrift stores which will allow you to save money that you can use on things you will want to buy new (socks, underwear, shoes, etc...note these items can be found cheap at Ross/Marshalls/TJMaxx as well as at Walmart and online at Amazon, 6pm, etc.).There are several ways you can get required vaccinations for your kids.  If these are covered by your health plan, make an appointment with your doctor now (you can also do this for school sports physicals).  Be sure to check with your school or public health district to see where and when you can get free or reduced-cost back-to-school vaccinations for your kids if you don't have medical insurance.  Note that if you can't afford medical insurance for your kids, check the requirements for state-sponsored children's health insurance plans; income requirements can change from year to year and while you might not have qualified last year, you may qualify this year.Put off some school expenditures.  If you have a kid going to college, let them take the basics and then figure out what to buy after they get to school (gift cards to Walmart and Target are great for this purpose).  They may not need a mini fridge if their dorm-mate has one, things that were cool in high school may not make the cut in their new school environment, etc.Consider last year's technology.  I'm sure most kids would like an iPhone 10X, a new iPad Pro, and an Intel i9 gaming laptop but an iPhone 8 will work just fine, a last-generation iPad will take care of their mobile tech needs, and an i5 or i7 laptop will work for everything from homework to gaming.Google for discount options.  If your college kid has a book list a mile long, Google for alternatives to buying books at full price from the school's book store (used books, sharing books, and downloading PDFs of the books may be some options).  Ditto for school uniforms and sports equipment (maybe set up a swap with other parents to hand down uniforms or equipment that no longer fit their children through the school's Facebook page).Attend any back-to-school events that are hosted by your kid's school.  These events are a great way to meet your kid's teachers, meet other parents, get a tour of the school, ask questions, and get info on everything from school supply lists to bus schedules to online school portal access, etc."},

{"title": "5 Fabulous Purchases", "date": "Sunday, July 14, 2019", "text": "Here are some of the purchases I have made in the past couple of weeks, all of which were well worth the money!Skullcandy wireless headphones.  I often watch YouTube videos while hubby and I are sitting on the sofa in the evening.  He is playing poker online and the TV is on in the background and I am usually reading, redditing, or watching YouTube videos on a wide range of topics.  The problem with YouTube videos is, of course, the sound.  I usually use my wired earbuds so hubby doesn't have to listen to both the TV and my video sounds and this system works OK but being tethered to the laptop means I've yanked the earbuds out of my ears a few times when I forgot I was physically attached to my computer.  Then I found a set of $25 wireless headphones at Ross.  These sound great, don't keep me tethered to the laptop (I can walk all over the downstairs of the house and still hear my video), and were a very inexpensive way to see if I even liked wireless headphones (I do--they are great!).  So while I don't see myself spending $300+ on wireless headphones like many techies do, this cheap option works way better than expected! A portable car battery jump starter.  Hubby has a van.  It is very old and the air conditioner is shot and the book value of the thing is $500 but he loves his van and doesn't want to get rid of it.  Needless to say we don't drive it at all during the summer because of the lack of air conditioning but when he went out to start it for his weekly check to make sure it was still operable, the battery was dead.  The thing with batteries is that ANY battery in a car in Las Vegas has a lifespan of about two years because of the high heat.  So we needed to jump start the battery and could have used cables and waited until the car parked in front of it was moved so we could get our other car in line to jump it but we decided to check out the new battery jump starters which are so popular now.  The reason they are so popular is that you don't need jumper cables or another car.  Just hook up the battery jump starter and crank the car and \"ta da\" your car will start.  What a great invention!  We went to Walmart and bought a cheap $40 jump starter, plugged it in to fully charge it when we got home, then jumped the car and it started on the first try!  I think this jumper starter is well worth the $40 price because not only does it quickly and easily jump cars, it also has an air compressor on it to put air in tires (or basketballs, bicycle tires, etc), and you can also charge any UBS device like a cell phone or tablet through the machine. A new Samsung Galaxy S8 cell phone.  I've been looking for a new cell phone for a while.  Hubby has my hand-me-down Galaxy Note 4 phone from 2014 which is an eon ago in tech time.  I wanted to get a new cell phone so he could upgrade to my hand-me-down Galaxy S8+ phone (it's big and beautiful and fast and still quite current technologically speaking).  When I checked out the ads today I saw that Best Buy had the Galaxy S8 (identical but smaller than the S8+) phone on sale for $350 (regularly $499).  Deciding I could easily use a smaller phone, I jumped on this sale.  Most new phones are going for $900+ these days but since I hardly use my phone (mostly just for texting hubby) I can't justify spending $900+ on a cell phone with five cameras and 5g and all of that fancy stuff.  I need to text and take photos and that's about it.  Now hubby and I both have great phones for much less than I had anticipated paying.A couple of Kipling bags.  I love Kipling bags but I can never pay full price for them.  Needless to say, unless I can get a Kipling bag at a 50%+ discount, I won't buy it.  I found these cute bags on sale for $10 (regularly $35 each) and didn't have a use for them but I bought them anyway (this brand makes excellent gifts for friends in Japan).  I had them sitting around for a week then I found a great use for them...  Emergency supplies.  Last week when I was at work hubby called me to say they were having a big earthquake at the casino he was at.  Fortunately it rolled and shook the building a bit but it wasn't a major quake.  But the idea of hubby being stuck away from me in a disaster situation was pretty scary.  He usually has his lunch and a drink with him and that's about it.  So I used the Kipling bags to make each of us small emergency (EDC--everyday carry) bags.  They are still a work in progress and I will do a separate post about every item I put in them, but these bags include everything from hubby's medications and spare hearing aid batteries to a written list of emergency contacts in case cell service goes down, a granola bar, matches, Wet Wipes, a pocket knife, an emergency whistle, a small flashlight, etc.While I don't shop a lot, I do like spending my money on useful, highly discounted, stuff!"},

{"title": "A Crazy 4th of July", "date": "Friday, July 5, 2019", "text": "Yesterday was a weird 4th of July holiday for us, mostly because...We had an earthquake!  I've been in earthquakes before in Seattle but this is the first one we have experienced in Las Vegas.  I was at work and started feeling dizzy but had no idea why.  Hubby called at the same time and said they were having a big earthquake at the casino he was at.  Although the earthquake was centered in California, some places in Vegas really felt the shaking while in other places, like the casino I was at, people just felt weird (one lady said she felt instantly nauseous and a guy thought he was having a blood pressure problem when he went to get up from the poker table; while the building didn't shake, I guess the minor undulation of the floor made everyone feel \"weird\").  Scary stuff!Then I asked if I am working next week, the last week of the tournament, and the answer was \"maybe\".  So at present I will just show up at work and see if there is anything for me to do.  It is always like this during the last week since it is unknown how many people will show up for the last few tournaments before the final days of the event.Finally, hubby and I decided to just stay home instead of going out to see the fireworks last night.  We can actually see the fireworks on The Strip from our deck and our neighbors must have spent thousands of dollars on illegal fireworks since they were literally shooting them off for hours last night.  We are just happy our house and palm trees weren't set on fire since it is very dry outside and sparks were flying everywhere.  I heard on the news that a total of 13 houses in our city were set on fire by fireworks last night :(Five unrelated things...Do you drive a Honda?  I heard on the news about the Honda airbag recall and I put my car's VIN number into the recall website.  My car didn't have a defective airbag but the SIL got a notice today that her Honda was part of the recall so I made an appointment to take it in to the shop next week and get a free fix for the problem.I'm thinking about ways to make money once my temporary job ends.  Lately I have been loving YouTube videos on all sorts of topics and while I would love to put together a good YouTube channel, I am not great at visual editing.  For those of you who are interested, this reddit posts lists some great links for people wanting to put together professional looking videos.Wireless headphones and earbuds are all the rage now.  I use my earphones and earbuds quite a lot (mostly for all of those YouTube videos I watch!) and I am often annoyed by the wires since they get tangled all the time.  Instead of springing for fancy smancy and horribly expensive wireless ear buds/phones ($300 for Sony 1000XM3s or $130 for Galaxy buds), I found a pair of Skullcandy wireless earphones for $24 at Ross.  Turns out they work great and the sound quality is just fine and it saved me a lot of money over buying the \"very best\" on the market.  Sometimes good enough is good enough.Are you a potential member of a class action lawsuit?  Here's a list of a whole bunch of current class action lawsuits.Amazon Prime Day will be here in a couple weeks.  While I have never found anything I needed from this popular online shopping sale, others might find this a great time to get discounts on the stuff they need."},
{"title": "In the Home Stretch...And a Bunch of Links and Updates Too", "date": "Saturday, June 29, 2019", "text": "On a happy note, I only have a week or so left of working this summer.  Overall it has been a great experience and I am even now looking forward to working at the WSOP again next summer.  Here's a bunch of links and updates...Last week hubby found himself back in the hospital with chest pain.  After a bunch of testing we found that while his stents are working as they are supposed to after his heart attack last year, there are still heart blockages that aren't \"bad enough\" for open heart surgery.  Yikes!  When he had the stents put in a year ago we were 100% vegan for a few months then slowly slipped back into bad eating habits.  After this latest scare we are again 100% WFPB vegan and so far no more chest pain and best of all, his blood pressure has dropped from 170/95 (with medication) to 106/65 (with the same medication).  Needless to say, he is going to have his doctor adjust his blood pressure medication as we don't want it to drop too low!  I came across this booklet on Dr Furhman's plan for lowering blood pressure and cholesterol which we are roughly following.Speaking of healthy eating, I absolutely LOVE my Insta-Pot type pressure cooker.  It is a great way to cook steel cut oats, chickpeas, dried beans, etc. and they all come out much healthier that using canned beans (too much salt in canned food).  I just cook up big batches of beans or grains then freeze them in meal-sized portions so cooking time each evening is super fast.Unrelated to money is this unusual (and very hard!) physical challenge, this interesting infographic of rarely used punctuation (most I'd never seen before), and this wonderful Twitter feed for Lake Clark National Park.I came across this review of Sweat Coin and since I love to walk I will try it as a way to create additional income after my current job is finished and I will also look into this list of 31 Ways to Make Passive Income which sounds like a great way to earn a bit of extra income in some unusual and fascinating ways.Then there is new app, Instawork, which was featured on the news and it looks like a great way to earn extra money, work when you want to, and experience lots of different work environments.Finally, I hope you and your family enjoy a happy, safe, and sane 4th of July holiday!"},

{"title": "An Update in 10 Points", "date": "Friday, June 7, 2019", "text": "It's been another busy week...I survived another week of my job (kind of).  I'd finally had enough of processes that didn't work and had a \"come to Jesus\" discussion with my boss's boss.  I'm surprised I wasn't fired (or maybe I will go back to work in a few days and be off the schedule...who knows).  I am a stickler for processes that are optimized to run smoothly and when things don't work, they need to be fixed ASAP and when people don't care if things work properly I can get cranky...seriously, middle-aged, pre-menopausal women are not to be trifled with.  On the other hand, I should probably be more tactful when I have something to say and maybe try for better timing to discuss my concerns (this is what the tournament looks like every.single.day).In other work news, I got put into the VIP section for a day and Holy Cow--the amount of money people spend on poker tournaments (this happens to be the biggest poker tournament in the world) is staggering!  The running list of famous people who came through the tournament is pretty impressive and the amount of money people pull out--in cash--is amazing (like $50k to $100k for ONE tournament!).  I WISH I could pull out hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and slap it down on my mortgage company's payment window, now THAT would be amazing!Our new furniture arrived! In other furniture news, I now have our old sofa taking up residence in our kitchen.  I tried to sell it on Craigslist and ended up with only one text message from a scammer (this is, I guess, a common scam).  Then I posted it on FB Marketplace and had only one response from someone who wanted to pay $40 instead of the $50 I was asking but when I clicked on his FB profile his photos were of him throwing down gang signs...uh no thanks.  So now the sofa will sit in our kitchen until a local non profit can pick it up...in three weeks which is the soonest they could get it.  Oh well.In other unrelated news, the new Raider's Stadium is going up quickly.  Yesterday we went to check out the new Palms Casino buffet (with a two-for-one lunch coupon, of course) and I saw this happy looking artwork on the wall.  I have always been a fan of Bill Nye.  This NSFW video cracked me up, probably because it was such a departure from his usual kid-friendly videos.And here are the '100 Best Free Software for Students' list.This is \"free fishing weekend\" in many places around the country.  This means you can go fishing for free without having to buy a license or permit--a fun and free (if you have the gear) way to spend the weekend!Finally, I saw this lady's garden featured on my of my favorite PBS shows, Growing a Greener World.  Her blog is wonderful, her photos are wonderful, and the sheer volume of gardening news and information she provides is amazing!"},
{"title": "An Update in 15 Points", "date": "Saturday, June 1, 2019", "text": "It's been a busy week...I started my summer gig.  It's fun and crazy and super busy but somehow I lucked out and got weekends off this year :)  On day one of the WSOP they were still setting everything up, a few days later there were over 5,000 people playing in only one event (that's busy!).  The weather has been unseasonably cool and rainy but we should hit 100 later this week.  Our apricots are blooming!  Yum!  We finally found the new living room set we have been looking for and got a great deal on it (no photo yet as it won't be delivered until later this week).I am trying to sell our old sofa so I am first listing it on Facebook Marketplace.  I have never used this before as everything I have sold online previously has been on Craigslist but FB is supposed to be the newest way to sell stuff so I thought I would give it a shot.I took our car to the dealership to get the oil changed yesterday (surprisingly it is the cheapest place in town to get an all synthetic-oil oil change) and was looking around at all of the new cars on the lot.  I can't believe that an \"average\" new car price is nearing $40,000!  I paid less than that for my first house!  Needless to say, we hope our current car will last for the next 20 years or so (at which time we will just Uber around during our old age).I think I got a homeless guy arrested today :(  There is a wash behind our house and we get the occasional homeless person who will go back there and take a nap during the day but when I looked out there this morning I saw a guy who looked like he was dead or something.  His bicycle was a couple hundred of feet down the wash from where he was, he looked relatively well dressed and clean cut, he was hanging practically upside down along the side of a wall, and he didn't change position over the course of a couple hours.  I yelled at him from our back yard but there was no response so I called 311 to have the police do a welfare check.  The police responded pretty quickly, got him up and talked with him for some time, then the next time I looked they were hauling him away in handcuffs!  Yikes!  Now I feel bad.  Unless he was wanted for serious warrants or something in which case I wouldn't feel that bad.Here's a big list of senior discounts.The Regal Summer Movie Express Program is offering $1 family movies all summer long!The internet is never short of fascinating websites.  I just came across one recently which is called \"Forgotten Now Found\" which offers fascinating stores of found things.I used to mostly read when I was online but these days I often fall down the rabbit-hole of YouTube and can watch more than a dozen videos in one day, hopping from topic to topic!Here's a great post about saving money on prescriptions.And CoolGuides has quite a lot of useful information.Of course when the internet gets to be too much, there is always Eyebleach."},

{"title": "100 Things About Retirement (Early or Otherwise)", "date": "Monday, May 20, 2019", "text": "I read this post over at Sam's blog which should be top of mind for anyone retiring in the next decade or two.  We've been kind of retired (hubby fully retired for the last decade, me kind of retired yet doing some gig work as it comes along for the last decade) and we have learned quite a few things along the way...MoneyThings change continually and sometimes drastically.  There is no way what you plan today will 100% happen in the future (look at what happened to Enron employees).Always live below your means.Always be debt free (certainly while you are still working and especially after you retire).When you retire on a fixed income, it is literally fixed (you may get a small COLA increase each year but other years you may not get this).On the flip side, everything goes up in price over the years (utilities, cost of food, cost of gas, cost of buying a new vehicle, etc).  See the problem between #4 and #5?Have multiple sources of retirement income if possible (social security, pension or multiple pensions, Roth IRA, 401k, investment income, etc).Have a HUGE emergency fund.  There will always be emergencies that come along (heating system goes toes up, car is totaled, etc) and living on a fixed income means you may not be able to cash flow such issues.Never never never co-sign a loan for anyone!!!  You don't want to be saddled with paying back a loan someone defaults on when you are retired on a fixed income.Watch out for scams on other \"great deals\" that will affect your money (don't send money to the Nigerian prince who emailed you, don't take out payday loans, be very careful with reverse mortgages, etc).Protect your money.  Keep most of it in a bank, don't give anyone else access to your accounts, check your accounts regularly for any purchases or withdrawals you didn't make, etc.DocumentsHave a notarized will.Have a medical power of attorney.Have an advanced directive.Have a living will.Consider a financial power of attorney if necessary.Consider having a POLST form if necessary.Pull your free annual credit report each year to make sure there are no problems you weren't aware of.Be sure to keep all of your important legal documents in a safe place where your next of kin can find them if needed.Consider getting a passport.  Even if you don't travel, this is definitive identification and good to have if you ever lose your other ID.Have a driver's license (or state ID card when it comes time to give up driving).  Again, this is an important form of ID to have.HousingPay off your home before you retire.Better yet, downsize your home and pay it off before you retire (it's cheaper to heat, air condition, maintain, and furnish a small home compared to a huge home).I am fully in the \"own a house\" camp while others may want to live in an apartment or RV or trailer or other type of place when they retire.  Generally houses hold their value while RVs and trailers don't and apartment rents seem to continually increase which is a problem when you are on a fixed income.Check to see what tax discounts you qualify for as a senior/retiree.  Some cities/counties offer tax abatement to those who are elderly or on a fixed income and many counties also have property tax caps so even if the place you live booms, your property tax bill won't skyrocket.Consider moving to a state that does not tax social security or pensions or military retirement pay if you receive this.In addition to #5, consider moving to a state with an overall low tax burden (some states don't tax income but have really high property tax or sales tax).Look at other housing options as you age.  Can you live in a \"mother in law\" tiny home on your kid's property?  Can you share housing with friends or relatives instead of each of you owning your own houses?Maintain your housing systems (plumbing, electrical, etc).  If you can not do this yourself or can't afford these fixes, many communities have \"senior fix up days\" where volunteers will come to your home and make repairs for free.When decorating and furnishing your home, consider minimalism and discount decorating (kind of like when you were in college).  Paying top dollar at retail stores for seasonal furnishing and decor is a quick way to go broke (and it's unnecessary, a livable home is more important than a lavish home).TransportationCars are expensive and driving gets more difficult as you age.  Can you take public transit and get rid of your car?  Is Uber or Lyft a better (and cheaper) option?  If you are disabled can you get a monthly bus/paratransit pass?Do you live in a place where you can walk to do all of your errands instead of driving?Definitely pay off you vehicle before you retire, you don't want big car loan payments when you are on a fixed income.Call around every year to see if you are getting the best deal on car insurance (in our area, the same policy can vary by hundreds of dollars depending on your insurance company!).Can you use a bicycle as your main form of transportation?  It's cheaper and makes you healthier (safety on the road would be my main concern with this form of transportation).Can you cobble together a transportation plan to avoid owning a vehicle?  Maybe walk for basic errands, car pool to work, take public transit, then rent a car when you need to make special trips somewhere.Do many of your \"errands\" online to cut down transportation needs.  Online banking instead of going to the bank, downloading e-books from the library instead of going to the library, shopping online and having your stuff delivered to your door, using Grub Hub or Uber Eats instead of going to a restaurant...so much of your life can be done online these days!See if you can get a discount on your car insurance if you take a senior driving class like those hosted by AAA, AARP, or 55 Alive.Even if you used to drive all over the country when you were younger, consider taking non-driving vacations like train trips, bus trips, or flying to your destination (it's both safer and easier to travel this way instead of driving).Stay safe on the road when you do drive--carry emergency supplies and equipment in your car, never drink and drive, and have a checklist of things to do should you get in a car accident.HealthKeep yourself as healthy as possible!  This cannot be overstated as the alternative is sickness and doctors and big medical bills.In addition to being proactive with your health, address dental, hearing, vision, and mental health issues as soon as possible so they don't grow into bigger (and more expensive!) problems.Start figuring out health insurance now.  The US healthcare situation is a hot mess.  Yes, you will be able to get Medicare when you turn 65 but you will still need to pay for it and Medicare doesn't cover everything like prescriptions so you will need additional insurance for the things Medicare doesn't cover.Get some exercise everyday.  This will go a long way towards keeping you healthy and fit and strong as you age.Know what to do when you have a medical crisis.  There are prescriptions assistance programs if you can't afford your medications, free and sliding scale clinics if you don't have health insurance, dental schools for cheap dental work, etc.  You can also call 211 to find out about even more health services offered in your community.Stay on top of your health metrics and fix medical problems immediately as they come up.  Keep your weight within a healthy range, be proactive with diet and exercise in addition to medication if you have high blood pressure; ditto if you have diabetes or high cholesterol.Consider medical tourism both for getting medications you can afford and for getting medical or dental work done.De-stress.  Stress is one of the leading causes of chronic disease in our country.  Meditate, do yoga, do breathing exercises, etc.  Keep up with your vaccinations.  Seniors still need booster shots as well as flu and pneumonia shots; ask your doctor for a vaccination schedule.Keep a list (written or on your computer) of all of the medications you take (both prescription and over the counter), allergies, medical and surgical history, doctor's name and number, etc.FoodConsider gardening as a hobby, this is a great way to grow some of your own food as well as cut your food budget.Eat at home as much as possible, this is often healthier than eating at restaurants and it is also cheaper as well.Learn to cook from scratch.  Buying processed and pre-prepared food can get expensive,  learning to cook from scratch can really stretch your food budget!Explore all of your food shopping options--local grocery stores, buying food online, CSAs, farmer's markets, ethnic grocery stores, Dollar Stores/99 Cent stores, etc.Use coupons and shop sales to cut your food budget even more.When you host get-togethers and parties, consider making them \"potlucks\" in order to save money yet still put on a fun social event.Consider bulk cooking (freeze the leftovers) so you will have many meal options even if you don't feel like cooking.If you must eat out, use coupons, ask for discounts, and eat lunch out instead of dinner to save money.If you will be out all day, consider packing a meal and beverage and taking it with you instead of being forced to hit up a fast food place or other restaurant.Consider eating more vegan/vegetarian as well as ethnic meals, these are often healthier as well as much cheaper to make than cooking up a slab of beef for each meal.Your BillsEven though you are debt free, your monthly bills will still keep coming in.  Be sure to review your list of bills (utilities, gas, food, insurance, etc) at least annually to figure out if there are ways to reduce or eliminate your bills (ie; if you have Netflix, you may be able to cut cable TV and just pay for internet and use an over-the-air antenna to get local TV stations).See if you can get a discount for pre-paying your bills.  We pay our car insurance every six months which saves over a hundred dollars over paying this bill monthly.Assign each bill a stream of income to pay for it.  My grandmother used to sell chicken eggs and that paid for the monthly electricity bill; I work a gig each summer which pays for a couple of annual bills including our car registration, my annual web hosting plan, and our annual sewer bill.Consider alternative ways to pay your bills.  For example, our electric company will either let you pay your regular bill each month (it's low in the winter then super high in the summer due to air conditioning) but they also have a plan where they calculate your annual electric cost then divide your bill into 12 monthly payments so you don't need to worry about super high summer bills.Put aside money from your fixed income to pay for annual and semi-annual bills.  Once your home is paid off and you don't use an escrow account any more, you will need to pay your property tax twice a year.  Instead of scrambling to get the money together to pay this bill, set aside money each month out of your budget to pay this bill.If your budget is super tight, consider things like side gigs, renting out a room on AirBnB, driving for Uber, or working annual events (like being an election worker, census worker, working in retail at Christmas, etc) to bring in extra money to cover your bills (note income restrictions as they relate to receiving social security!).Take drastic action to cut your bills.  I would love to get rid of our cars and just Uber around but hubby is firmly against this; doing the math I think it would save us money.  I've considered getting a tablet and cheap tablet plan (I'm mostly where there is free wifi) then just carrying an off-line cell phone only for calls to 911 in an emergency (this would also save money but hubby isn't too keen on this idea either).See if there are assistance programs to help you pay your bills if needed.  Usually electric companies have assistance programs to help seniors pay their electric bills, there are free and low-cost cell phone plans for seniors, and don't be ashamed to hit up a food bank, free meal program, or sign up for food stamps if you qualify.See if there are things you are paying for each month that you no longer need.  Most people can get rid of their home phone since they have a cell phone and many people rent their cable/internet modem yet it is much cheaper to buy one outright rather than rent one each month.Get rid of subscriptions and other recurring payments for things you no longer need.  Timeshares are a huge waste of money for most people (they are hard but not impossible to get rid of), ditto gym memberships, magazines can be found free online instead of subscribing to them, etc.Discretionary SpendingPlan ahead for gifts.  Depending on how big your family is, birthday and Christmas gifts can turn into a burden.  Don't be afraid to cut down on the gifts you give when living on a fixed income or give different gifts (like coupons for free babysitting to your relatives if they have kids) instead of giving expensive things that you can no longer afford.Make a shopping list so when you do go to the store, you know exactly what you need and can avoid impulse spending.Always do your research on things you want to buy.  I keep two shopping lists--things we really need like grocery items we are almost out of and a list of \"nice to have\" items.  The grocery items we buy during our weekly shopping trips (hopefully at the 99 Cent store where everything is so cheap!) and the \"nice to have\" items stay on the list until I can find the item at the Goodwill or at online stores with a steep discount (I wanted a sling bag from REI which was $40+ dollars but by waiting I found it on a closeout sale for $20!).Try to buy the things you need like clothes and household items at the Goodwill and other thrift stores (on sale days to save even more money!).  This is a great way to get things you need at a fraction of the cost of retail.Experiment with bartering--this gets rid of things you no longer need and gets you new things that you want.  Selling things online and holding garage sales also have the dual purpose of clearing out stuff you no longer need and putting some extra money in your pocket.Seniors have a lot of extra time which is great for people who like to travel.  There are many ways to travel for free or cheap if you have a lot of time.  Off-season cruises are much cheaper than high season cruises, ElderHostel and Servas cater to seniors, and visiting family and friends is often a great way to travel cheap (staying with friends or family saves on hotel costs) plus being flexible allows you to find the cheapest airline tickets (or you can be adventurous and take an inexpensive Flix/Megabus/Boltbus trip).Don't shop for entertainment!  I used to wander around the mall when I was bored which led to buying things I really didn't need.  Only shopping when you specifically need an item will save you a lot of money on impulse purchases.Do no-spend days, weeks, or even months.  This is a great way to save money and it will also challenge you to \"reduce, reuse, recycle, or do without\" when you need something that you would otherwise run to the store for.Although \"couponing\" isn't as popular as it once was, there are still hundreds of thousands of Google search pages on the topic.  The strategic use of coupons and sales can result in buying lots of things you need for very little money.Sign up for birthday freebies.  We no longer get each other birthday presents as we have everything we need so we spend or birthdays redeeming \"birthday freebies\" which start showing up in our email boxes about a week prior to our birthdays.Fun and EntertainmentAs a retiree you will have A LOT of hours to fill, make a plan for how you will fill these hours with fun and inexpensive activities.Take advantage of senior entertainment discounts (like cheap matinees at the movie theater), senior center events, senior-centered events at the library, etc).Participate in clubs and activities that align with your interests (we have hundreds of clubs in our city from walking and genealogy clubs to hiking clubs, astronomy clubs, coin collecting clubs, etc.Consider volunteering.  This fills your days, allows you to share skills and wisdom you have acquired over the years, and helps out organizations that are beneficial to the community.Keep your brain sharp!  The internet is perfect for this with free puzzles (I often do free online crossword and sudoku puzzles), many library services that can be accessed online (I've downloaded a bajillion e-books from our wonderful library system), and there is online gaming which many people seem very fond of.Consider hobbies that can also make you some money.  My cousin gardens and has honey bees so he sells stuff from his garden as well as honey at his local farmer's market each summer; this is a great way to make your hobby pay for itself as well as give you a bit of extra money.Look for senior-specific groups and clubs which save you money and provide fun and entertainment.  Hubby is on several senior bowling leagues, there is a wonderful--and free!--hiking group in our area which you have to be 50 or older to join, and our local PBS station always advertises several senior-only events like teas and trips and shows.Live in a vacation destination.  We live in Las Vegas so there are oodles of free and cheap entertainment that we can enjoy every day of the year (we previously lived in a family-oriented rural-ish community where there were some family activities like kids sports and roller skating but not much in the way of fun daily activities).Buy an Entertainment Book, buy a Fill a Seat/House Seats subscription, and look through your junk mail for discounts and freebies on all kinds of things from haircuts and plays to restaurant freebies and free concerts.Look at the Goodwill for discounted hobby materials.  Our Goodwill has everything from hardly used exercise equipment to knitting supplies to sewing machines to electronics equipment and much more.  This is a great way to explore a new hobby without breaking the bank.Getting Help as You AgePlan to spend more to do the jobs that you used to do around the house (hubby is no longer allowed on ladders or on the roof so we hire jobs requiring this out these days).  Also, while we can do some home jobs, anything with heavy lifting we hire out so we don't injure our backs (oh to be young when we could do all sorts of things without worrying about the long-term health implications!).Consider having long-term care insurance.  The point between living independently and living in a nursing home for the rest of your life can be a difficult transition, especially if there is no money to cover home-based, long-term care or assisted living care.Consider moving in with family if this is a viable option.  In most countries it would be considered weird for elderly family members to live by themselves in their own house; usually elders live with their kids and provide free babysitting for the grandkids, cook, clean the house, and otherwise help out their kids while living in a multi-generational household.Consider trading what you have (room in your home for example) with someone who can help you around the house (like college students who need housing and can help around the house).  Apparently this is a thing now.Take advantage of all of the community programs you qualify for.  Meals on Wheels, state-funded senior programs, food stamps, in-home care, paratransit, etc.  You can find these programs by Googling online, by calling 211, or by contacting your local Area Agency on Aging.You may not be able to do as much as you used to do physically so consider ways to get the things you need done in the most cost efficient way possible (instead of winging it if our car breaks down, we have an AAA membership now; many of our elderly relatives have home warranties because they can no longer do their own appliance repair; we have a couple good handymen on speed dial if we need help with painting or trimming our palm trees, etc). If you take a bunch of prescription medication, you should keep an updated list of all medications (name, dosage, frequency) and take this with you each time you visit your doctor.  Since hubby takes several medications daily we use those little medicine holders to organize his daily meds so he doesn't forget to take them/forget if he already took them (sometimes we both forget and we don't want him to overdose!).Make sure your home is \"senior safe\".  Install grab bars if needed, make sure your fire detector/CO detector is in good working order, get rid of falls hazards, etc.If you are on your own, look for ways to protect yourself.  If you tend to fall, have a senior alert necklace or something like that; put a message on your cell phone that will tell EMTs what you are allergic to/major medical problems like you are a diabetic/and who to contact in an emergency; my cousin's son put a camera in her home and she waves to him through the camera each morning so he knows she is up and about even though he lives several thousand miles away.Give to others.  You can't take it with you so consider giving away things to loved ones instead of having them squabble over your jewelry and antiques after you die.  Spend time with the grandkids (this will benefit them for a lifetime).  Help others and allow them to help you (it's amazing how seniors who live in senior housing communities do things to help each other out)."},

{"title": "Bargain Food Shopping", "date": "Monday, May 6, 2019", "text": "I am back on the healthy food kick that I should have been on all along...but I sort of fell off the wagon a while back.  A few days ago hubby and I were reminded just how fleeting life is when a friend of ours literally dropped dead a half hour after we were with her.  Hubby often bowled with our friend, and while she was in her early 70s, she seemed to be in great health.  She walked everywhere since she didn't drive and she was was really excited that her new grand baby was coming to visit that evening.  A few hours after we left her at the bowling center, another friend of ours texted the group and told us that the friend had had a massive heart attack at the bowling center and passed away.  Needless to say, everyone was pretty shaken up by this news.  So while we can never predict when someone will die, even if they appear to be in a great health, these sorts of things can happen.  It just makes sense to live as healthy as possible and hope for the best I guess.So back to today's topic.  Fortunately we have many of the resources that make healthy eating feasible if that's what we choose to do (and everyone should choose to eat healthy but there are so many reasons we don't).  We have plenty of time to cook healthy food since neither of us are working, we have the money to easily pay for food, we have the knowledge to cook healthy food both from experience as well as by having the internet at our fingertips, and we have lots of stores with inexpensive, healthy food where we live as well as a car to easily go shopping (for another take on health eating check out Dar's posts on her Food Basket Challenge). Also, I was extra encouraged to resume eating better because I did a 10k with the vegans this weekend and they were so inspiring!  I call a couple in our walking club \"the vegans\" because they are in their late 70s and have been vegans for nearly 50 years.  They always talk about what they eat and their healthy lifestyle and they are excellent examples of aging well.  They both have blood pressures around 115/70 (I asked), they make it a point to walk three miles every single day (the lady was emphatic that no matter what you are doing you need to make it a point to walk every day), and they are wicked smart (they both have a lot of interesting hobbies, are retired from professional jobs but still keep up with their industries, and are truly fascinating to talk to). So this morning I hit the 99 Cent store and stocked up on nutritious food and we are officially back on the healthy-eating bandwagon.  For a grand total of $23.96 I bought:2 pounds of sweet potatoes1 pound of jalapenos3 pounds tomatoes2 pounds strawberries15 ounces steel cut oats15 ounces ground flax seeds2 pounds apples1 pound black beans4 avocados3 pounds pears2 pounds onions1 pound limes8 ounces unsalted peanuts3 bunches cilantro3 hearts romaine lettuce1 pound 6 ounces tortillas1 bunch of green onions4 cloves peeled garlic1 bag of spinachNow I'm off to whip up a nutritious strawberry/banana/spinach/flax seed smoothie for breakfast!"},
{"title": "Some Random Musings", "date": "Thursday, May 2, 2019", "text": "I loved this bag when I saw it at REI but a month or so ago the price was $45 which, while I liked the bag, I didn't like it $45 worth.  So yesterday when I was walking around the shopping district and stepped into REI, I saw that it was on sale for $21 so I bought it.  Love the way it looks and the way it carries my stuff!I've been wanting a new bag and when I walked around the outlet mall last weekend, I saw a Tumi bag I liked (although again, I didn't like it $300(!) worth) and when I went to look for the bag online to see if I could get it cheaper, it was nowhere to be found.  With a little Googling, I found that outlet stores, instead of selling overruns and sale items, actually create lower quality, outlet-store-only items.  That will certainly make me think twice about buying anything at an outlet.I'm super stoked about working at the WSOP again this summer--it's a fun and really interesting experience.  Here is an article I found about how our cage operations work.Here is a great infographic about how to earn money without a job (I really should try some of these!).Speaking of interesting ways to earn money, I came across this website which provides a connection between content creators and people who want to buy content.Finally, I've always thought it would be so cool to own an entire town.  Here is an article about people who have actually bought their own town.  Fascinating!"},

{"title": "I Think We Are Weird", "date": "Wednesday, April 24, 2019", "text": "As Dave Ramsey says, \"be weird!\"  And judging by the reaction of our recent guests, I think we are.  Cases in point...I make our lunches and pack beverages in the morning when we leave our house.  \"But you don't work!\" said one SIL.  It still saves us from eating out everyday when we are out and about all day.When we go out to restaurants the hubby and I always split one meal (and usually need a box to take home leftovers).  The SILs looked at us oddly but saw that indeed, we didn't even finish a single meal between the two of us.Why don't you have a printer for your computer?  I took one SIL to the local office store and showed her how I printed out needed documents for 12 cents a page instead of buying expensive printer ink that dries out before we can even use it.  She actually loved this idea and said she would do the same in the future.Why do you cook so much?  All during the SILs visit, I cooked breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert at home most days, plus enough for leftovers.  Many retirees we know who live in Vegas eat out multiple times a day--it's fast, it's convenient, and it is relatively inexpensive.  But cooking most of our meals at home means we save even more money and the food is healthier as well.  Note they got used to eating home-cooked meals with us and seemed to like it by the end of their stay.Anytime the SILs needed something, I hopped on the computer to see if there was a discount for the things they needed.  I found a Groupon for a local massage place, buy-one-get-one-free buffet coupons when we all went out to dinner, a quick application for the SIL who qualified for a tax exemption which saved her hundreds on her car registration, half price movie tickets on senior day at the local casino, and really inexpensive Megabus tickets to LA (instead of flying for 10 times the cost of the bus ticket).Since both SILs are newly retired, they were amazed/amused at the lengths we went to in order to live on a small fixed income.  And both said \"we need to do more things like you guys do\" so I guess they may have though us odd but not too extreme since they will most likely institute some of our money-saving ideas."},

{"title": "Do You Qualify for a Tax Exemption?", "date": "Wednesday, April 10, 2019", "text": "We are helping the SIL get settled in and one of the things on our \"to do\" list was getting her set up for any tax exemptions she might qualify for.  Many areas have tax exemptions for people, sometimes for seniors, sometimes for veterans, and sometimes for the disabled. Since she is a disabled senior citizen veteran she is rocking all three of these qualifiers!Tax exemptions usually provide rebates or discounts on the taxes you need to pay like the property tax that you pay for your home or the real property tax you pay when you register your vehicle every year.  In our area, veterans and disabled veterans qualify for a tax discount which you can use on your home and/or car and it is as simple as signing up once at the county office.Hubby uses his veteran's tax exemption each year when we register our cars and it saves us a couple hundred dollars each time which is a wonderful discount!  The SIL found out she will receive $700 in annual discounts which is a pretty big chunk of money and well worth the minimal effort needed to sign up for the program.Everyone should check their local jurisdictions (city, county, state) and see if there are any sort of programs like these that they qualify for.  These programs are especially valuable for seniors and people who live on a fixed income because, while they may own their home free and clear, if they live in an expensive area, it can help them pay their annual property tax which often increases exponentially each year."},

{"title": "Random Senior Moments", "date": "Sunday, April 7, 2019", "text": "For the past 24 hours our living room looks like a hot rock full of beached seals.  Everyone is wrapped in blankets, sprawled out on the sofas, doing as little as physically possible as we all recover from whatever viral malady invaded our house.  Now that hubby and his sisters are all nearing/at 70 years old, there has been a lot of discussion about senior citizen stuff that many people wouldn't think about.  In the interest of taking care of yourself into your old age--financially and otherwise--here are some of the topics we have been discussing...We need a single story house.  Watching the SILs go up and down the stairs is painful for them (they both have mobility issues) and painful to watch.One of the SILs forgot her cane at home so we were able to find one at the Goodwill for $2 (and they had lots of other stuff for the elderly there too at what I'm guessing are huge discounts compared to buying the stuff at retail).Everyone is forgetful.  This ranges from the funny \"where are my glasses??\" \"they're on your head!\" to the serious \"did I already take my pills?\" to the \"I can't find my ___\" which sends everyone into a frenzy looking for the lost item.  If you forget where your cell charger is, it isn't a huge deal.  If you overdose on your meds because you can't remember if you took them it can be deadly!  Something must trigger the scammers when a person hits 65.  I noticed a huge uptick in scam calls when hubby hit this age and both SILs said they had received numerous scam calls (one was on the phone with the \"IRS\" for an hour but hung up when the person said they would stay on the phone with her while she drove to Walmart to send them money!?!).  Our solution is to never answer our phones if we don't know who is calling.  We let these calls go to voice mail and can evaluate the calls if a message is left (this rarely happens).  If you do get a call from any \"official\" place like the IRS, your bank, or the power company, hang up and call them back (look up their number online, don't call the number they may give you) and ask them if they have tried to contact you.  More likely than not, it was a scammer calling you since all legit agencies will send you official information by mail and not via a phone call.The SILs went shopping a few days ago and both came back with some sort of cell phone package (headphones, cell charging case) which they bought at a kiosk at the local tourist mall which cost them $300 each.  OMG I wanted to bang my head against the wall.  These places are scammy!  If you can't return an item (there was a no return policy they said) and if the item is ridiculously overpriced (I couldn't have bought the same stuff for under $100) IT IS A SCAM.  \"But they looked up the item online and showed me I was getting a great deal!\" one SIL said.  I showed her how I could make a website in under 10 minutes with items listed for any price I wanted to put there.  Ayayay.  If you know you need an item like a cell charger, buy it from your phone's manufacturer which offers a warranty and a good return policy.  If you want a specific brand name item and you are tech savvy, go ahead and buy it on sale from legit resellers (Best Buy, for example).  It's infuriating that the most vulnerable people--the elderly--are such a huge target for scammers!Overall we are having a grand ole amusing time even if we have gone through a record amount of Kleenex and fortunately we are all on the mend and hopefully this viral mess will be over soon (and hopefully people who scam old people will die a horrible fiery death!  It's infuriating that the most vulnerable people--the elderly--are such a huge target for scammers!)."},

{"title": "Set Yourself Up for Financial Success in Your 20s", "date": "Wednesday, April 3, 2019", "text": "I came across this article, '20 Tips for Financial Planning in Your 20s' and thought that I wish I had this information back in my 20s, I'd be in a much better financial position today if I had done these things decades ago!  And while many of these tips are good, many of them could be better...Avoid credit card debt.  I am not anti-credit card but people do need to use them properly to keep a good credit score while not digging themselves into a hole of debt.  My advice would be to get a few credit cards and use them regularly.  Make sure you have the cash on hand to pay off these cards each month so you don't pay interest and you don't get mired in revolving debt.Only borrow what you need for an education.  My advice would be to not borrow anything for a college education.  Go into the military, apply for every scholarship you even remotely qualify for, cash flow your way through community college, and/or get a job that helps pay for your education...whatever it takes to end up with zero debt when you get out of college.  College loan horror stories are much too easy to find online so avoid this trap all together.Be careful about borrowing anything else.  I would definitely save up and pay cash for a car instead of getting an auto loan, I would avoid payday loans and rent-to-own places like the plague, and again, if you need to buy a sofa or something, save up the cash, buy the sofa with your credit card, then pay off the card before the next payment is due.Pay attention to your credit.  Obviously everyone should pull their free credit reports annually to make sure there are no mistakes and, as I recently learned, check your credit cards online every month so you don't miss any surprise charges.Pay your bills on time.  This is a no-brainer.  Never pay late fees and avoid bad marks on your credit report by always paying your bills on time.Open a checking account on your own.  Everyone should open their own financial accounts as soon as they turn 18.  Of course, don't overdraw these accounts or otherwise mess them up or you could lose the ability to have a checking/savings account!Open a savings account.  See #6 above, and additionally, save 10% of every dollar you ever make to give yourself a nice financial cushion in your old age.Open a retirement account.  See #6 above, and again, if you save another 10% of every dollar you ever make, your retirement will very nice indeed.  Also, take advantage of any employer who will either add to your retirement account and/or match your retirement account deposits.Learn about investing.  Definitely do this.  In fact, many high schools and colleges have investing clubs where you can learn about investing and share information with others about the topic.Purchase life insurance.  IMHO most young people don't need life insurance unless they are married and/or have kids.  As long as you have enough money to pay for your untimely death in savings, that's all you need.Develop a marketable skill.  Yes yes yes...this so much.  Work is all about having a marketable job skill (skills that are in demand and that employers/customers will pay you good money for).  Anyone can flip a burger, not everyone can provide dental services, drive a semi, or weld underwater.Consider a side hustle.  Years ago this was really common.  Every kid in the neighborhood made money doing everything from babysitting and mowing laws to delivering newspapers and even modeling on the side.  Having the ability to side hustle some money when needed is a valuable skill indeed.Give to others.  I am a big fan of tithing and volunteering to help those in need.  I am not a fan of just giving money to other people unless it is a gift as loaning money usually doesn't end well.Start building a network.  Even learning social skills and communication skills will go a long way towards increasing your income potential.Establish your priorities.  Having financial goals is a great idea but if you can't think of any spending goals that's OK too, just keep saving then when you determine a big goal, you will be well positioned to achieve it.Create a spending plan or budget.  Everyone should have both a budget (how you plan to allocate your money) as well as a way to track your spending (a great way to see where your money actually goes so you can make tweaks to your spending if necessary).Talk finances with your significant other.  Obviously this isn't necessary if you are just dating (and by all means do not tell every person you know how much you have in savings and investments!).  While dating you will have a good idea of how your SO handles money and when it comes time to get married, you definitely want to lay all of your financial cards on the table and ensure you are both on the same (financial) page.Get used to saving up for big purchases.  See above, you want to have the cash on hand for most things you purchase, the only thing I would recommend going into debt for is a house in which case you would need to save up for the down payment.Learn to cook.  This is a huge money-saver.  Buying and cooking cheap ingredients is much less expensive than eating out everyday (healthier too!).Learn to say no.  Say no to loaning money, say no to timeshares, say no to \"trendy\" purchases, say no to things you can't afford, etc.And five more of my own tips:Pay to take care of your health in your 20s.  Eat healthy food, get your teeth cleaned and examined regularly, don't participate in risky behavior, etc.Chose the people you hang out with wisely.  Gang bangers will get you shot, scammy people will try to steal your money, addicts are just bad news all the way around...Pay less for stuff and more for experiences.  I'm a big fan of minimalism so that I can spend my money on travel and knowledge and other great experiences!Avoid scams.  MLMs and time shares and subscription services that are impossible to get out of...there are a lot of scams out there so you need to protect yourself and your money from these.Enjoy your money.  People are so stressed out about money but by spending your money on things you absolutely love it can bring a lot of joy into your life!"},

{"title": "Cooking for a Crowd", "date": "Friday, March 29, 2019", "text": "Cooking for a crowd is kind of our thing.  We had a restaurant and catering business years ago and when I ran a non-profit I used to cook lunch for all of our clients every week so I actually enjoy cooking for groups of people.  This week we are cooking for the SILs and their friends and while everyone is kind of low-maintenance, one of the SILs is not eating bread or rice for Lent.  The no rice thing has been a bit of a challenge since most of our meals are some sort of Asian food but we persevere.  I have several tricks for cooking for a crowd which include:Cake mixes are quick to whip up and are very little work to make yet can be an easy way to make dessert for a crowd.Cookies are also easy to make.  A couple of tips--if you don't have a lot of time, put the entire bowl of cookie dough into a sheet pan and after is has baked, cut up into cookie sized pieces.  Also, when I make chocolate chip cookies I only use one third of the package of chocolate chips per batch, it doesn't look like the cookies are short on chips and I can make three times the amount of cookies for the price of one bag of chips.A simple meal of pasta with sauce, garlic bread, and salad can stretch a few dollars into a pretty big meal for a crowd.The same is true of those rotisserie chickens at Costco or the grocery store deli.  From one chicken you can make chicken Caesar salad, white chicken pizza, chicken and dumplings, and many other meals.  Instead of serving fried chicken which serves about four people per chicken, picking the chicken off of the carcass and using it in casserole/salad/pizza recipes can make the one chicken feed a dozen people!  Note that you can then use the chicken carcass to make chicken noodle soup from scratch.Making a giant salad is another way to make a few ingredients stretch for a large group.Taco bars are also popular at our house.  Simply make/cut up the parts of the taco (meat, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, etc), heat up some tortillas, and have everyone make their own tacos.We cook a lot of Asian food and many of the dishes are an inexpensive way to feed a crowd--fried rice, noodle dishes, spring rolls, and big stir frys are full of inexpensive ingredients that can feed a lot of people for very little money.We also cook more than enough food so we have lots of leftovers.  Our guests usually come and go at all hours so this way if they are hungry, they can just look at the leftovers in the fridge and help themselves when they are hungry.We keep plenty of whatever fresh fruit is in season on hand so everyone will have easy snacks to grab.We hard boil eggs and boil up a bunch of potatoes to have on hand as well (this makes for a quick breakfast, an easy potato salad, or egg salad sandwiches, etc.).We also check the loss leaders at the grocery store to see what's on sale then make something using these ingredients.  One rotisserie chicken on sale, a bag of hamburger buns from the clearance rack, a 10 pound bag of potatoes for 99 cents, and a head of cabbage which was also on sale became pulled chicken sandwiches, homemade French fries, and coleslaw for lunch a couple days ago.The bottom line is to use what's on sale, cook from scratch instead of treating everyone to meals at a restaurant, and pick recipes that make your food--especially meat--stretch (one friend always does seafood boils when she has a lot of guests and it looks like she spends a fortune on crab, clams, oysters, etc.  Yikes!)."},
{"title": "10 Things for Guests", "date": "Thursday, March 28, 2019", "text": "We've been busy this week with the SILs (one who is visiting and one who is moving here) and their friends (they know A LOT of people in Vegas and southern California).  Here are 20 things about having guests...We make sure we are stocked up on supplies (lots of toilet paper from Costco, a supply cabinet with soap/spare toothpaste/spare toothbrushes/etc).We also stocked up on food (before they got here we went to the Asian food store and stocked up on Filipino food, got cases of bottled water from Costco, and hit the butcher shop and seafood stores).We cook three times a day for whoever is here and leave plenty of leftovers in the fridge that can easily be heated up.Fortunately one SIL has her car here so they can go around together.  We also have a spare car for guests who don't drive here which makes it easier than schlepping people all over town, this way they can come and go as they please.We have a half dozen spare house keys and give one to each guest so they can come and go even if we aren't home.We kind of have our own set schedule and try to work our schedule around the things that our guests want to do.I email lots of info to each of our guests about things I know they like to do (one SIL loves bingo so I send her links to all of the bingo places around town, another likes touristy stuff so I send her suggestions of things to do).I've got Megabus, FlixBus, and Google flights on my favorites list so I can easily look up/book travel for them (they are going to LA this week and maybe elsewhere next week so it's easy enough to look up and find the best fares this way.  All of us are too old to want to drive six+ hours one way to further flung destinations).We use coupons and know where all the best (cheapest) restaurant specials are for when we take everyone out to the occasional dinner.  This plus using hubby's casino comps makes treating our guests to a dinner out very inexpensive.We will occasionally do touristy things with our guests but more often than not will do things like drop them off on The Strip then pick them up later (saves the expensive parking fee) since the last thing hubby wants to do is walk for miles on this popular tourist attraction in our city.Overall we love having guests but we like when they \"do their own thing\" while they are here, using our house as their home base.  This seems to work out well for everyone."},

{"title": "Walking to Do My Errands", "date": "Saturday, March 23, 2019", "text": "I love walking to do my errands.  Today I walked about four miles and was able to hit the bank, get my hair cut, buy some groceries, pick up a few things at Target, and check the dollar store for a couple of things (which they didn't have, it's kind of hit or miss there).  This is a great way to get some exercise while checking off things on my \"to do\" list and I save gas this way too (not sure how much gas it saves, probably not much, but it does reduce my carbon footprint a bit).Of course there are places where the nearest store can be miles away or there are days when you need a couple cases of water (or you need to do a Costco run!) which would make walking to do your errands kind of impossible, but for many people in urban areas or near the center of small towns, walking make a lot of sense.Walking to do your errands also has the benefit of limiting what you buy.  I bring a couple of strong nylon shopping bags with me to carry my haul but over-shopping isn't an option when I have to schlep everything back home.Overall, walking to do errands is a win-win-win-win...exercise, save gas, get things done, and limit spending...I should do this more often!"},

{"title": "College Alternatives", "date": "Monday, March 18, 2019", "text": "It's college season but with all of the scandal over rich parents trying to bribe their kids into top schools, it's kind of cast some shade on alternatives, especially for kids who may not want to go to college or may not do well in college.  Here are some alternatives to going to college:Take a gap year.  For kids who want to take a break between high school and college, a gap year might be their best option (even Malia Obama did this!).Work first until they know exactly what they want to do.  Some kids have no idea what they want to do after high school and rather than wasting money and switching majors a half dozen times, some students may want to work until they figure out what to do for their future.Join the military.  If nothing else, they will get some adult experience, learn responsibility, and get help paying for college through the GI Bill program.Get into an apprenticeship program.  Some kids are way more technically oriented than college oriented.  Also, there are lots of technical jobs going unfilled because fewer students are going into apprenticeships after high school.  Apprenticeship programs are a great way to learn skills that will get them a good job later.Look into Job Corps.  For kids who crashed and burned through high school, an option to finish school, get a GED, and learn job skills may lie in joining Job Corps.Start a business.  For kids who are more entrepreneurial than college-oriented, starting a small business might be a better option than going to college.Travel.  Again, for kids who are undecided, traveling the world after high school, whether to do volunteer humanitarian projects or hike the Pacific Crest Trail, may give them time to figure out what they want to do in their future.Get a Thiel.  The Thiel Fellowship, along with other contests and awards, are a unique way to do something other than college right after high school.Get an internship.  There are many internships that high school students can apply for.  As in this example, an internship is a great way to see if the career path you are interested in is right for you (imagine going all the way through pre-med only to find out blood makes you faint!).Other options: I know one girl who took over the family business after high school instead of going to college, other kids just hang out instead of going on to college (not recommended, I know one lady whose son is still just hanging out not doing much of anything at 30 years old!), one guy I went to high school with won a radio contest years ago the summer after high school and gets something like $1000 per week for life (he didn't go on to college), another guy goes around doing food challenges as his \"career\" (eeekkk)."},

{"title": "Apparently I'm an Activist?", "date": "Friday, February 22, 2019", "text": "I came across this article today about people who only buy used clothes, never new stuff off the rack.  Buying second hand clothing is apparently a form of environment and consumer activism according to the article. I'd never really thought about it that way as the things I love about buying used clothing is that they are really cheap (I wasted WAY too much money over a period of many years shopping at the mall and buying the latest fashions), you can see exactly how they will fit after washing since they have most likely already been washed several times (no surprises like getting a new garment home, washing it, and seeing that it had both shrunk--a lot--as well as faded out), and they don't have that new garment chemical feel and smell (ick).I am a firm believer in buying nearly all of my clothes at the Goodwill (except for underwear, bras, socks, and shoes) and hubby feels the same way.  Even at Ross or TJ Maxx he will look at new clothes they say \"I can buy that same shirt for a couple dollars at the Goodwill!\"  We first started shopping for thrift store clothes about the time we decided to get out of debt so that we could sell our house and nearly everything we owned so that we could travel for a while.  The first few times in a Goodwill were kind of \"eeuwww\" mostly because we had always associated people shopping at such stores as poor and desperate and out of style.Fast forward to today and we can find all kinds of great clothes at the Goodwill, most barely used, and all super stylish.  Best of all, we generally shop on sales days so we can buy shirts for $1 to $3 and pants for $2 to $5!  Also, if you look in the parking lot of these thrift stores you can barely count all of the BMWs, Mercedes, and other high end cars--these people aren't poor and desperate, just careful with their money.Whether you are into thrift store shopping to save the environment or to stymie consumerism, doing so (especially in our area where we have a transient population that donates a lot of great clothes to  these stores) not only saves you a LOT of money but you can try styles you otherwise wouldn't due to expense, and if you decide you don't like the clothes or they really are too radical for your style, you can always give it away or re-donate it without losing much money. If you haven't tried thrift store shopping yet--for both clothing as well as other durable goods--you owe it to yourself to give it a try.  You will probably find some amazing stuff at amazingly low prices!"},

{"title": "Oh The Drama", "date": "Tuesday, February 19, 2019", "text": "I need to get off social media.  I have cut back on Facebook quite a bit and rarely use Twitter or Instagram anymore but I check reddit several times a day and then fall down the rabbit hole and then an hour later I realize I have wasted way too much time with online drama.  On the one hand, I like to keep up with whatever is going on both in the news and in the social media sphere, on the other hand, since this stuff doesn't directly affect me, I could probably be spending my time more effectively doing other things.Yesterday's drama was a possible murder that was being covered up.  The dead lady's friends posted about this weird case but there was absolutely no news coverage about the incident until reddit got spun up then the news stations took notice (I swear the media no longer looks for news happening but just waits until something starts to trend on reddit then picks up the story, generally using only details provided by reddit and not, you now, doing actual investigative journalism).Today's drama was even more...dramatic...as a popular romance writer found out her work had been plagiarized, she wrote about it, then several other very well-known writers found that they were also victims of the plagiarizer.  Yikes!  Twitter was like a never-ending soap opera all day today, #CopyPasteCris was trending, and there probably isn't a hole deep enough for the plagiarizer to hide in now that she has riled up a vast segment of the population (oddly enough, the main person she stole work from is a well-known romance writer who also happens to be an attorney who also happens to teach intellectual property law...double yikes!).tldr; social media is a huge time suck, I need to find something better to do, but first I need to check the latest Tweets on the plagiarism scandal..."},
{"title": "Snow!", "date": "Monday, February 18, 2019", "text": "It snowed in Las Vegas last night which is both rare (I think it last snowed here a decade ago) and exciting (even more so because you know it won't last for days on end so you need to quickly get out and enjoy it).  There are several money-saving things to know about snow in a place that doesn't usually get snow...full coverage car insurance is a good thing; there were a lot of wrecked cars on the roadways this morning even though there was less than two inches of snow that fell overnight.stay home if possible.  Again, there were so many wrecks on the freeway they closed down a big section between Vegas and LA until the snow melted this afternoon.if you are driving a distance in the snow, make sure you have plenty of emergency supplies in your car like water, food, and blankets (some people were stranded on the freeway for hours).don't expect snow plows.  I don't think our city even owns a snow plow because snow is so rare and usually melts within hours.if you do wreck or get stranded in the snow, having a AAA membership is also a good thing (free towing and roadside service for less than $100 per year).you need to cover your plants in really cold weather; there are a lot of cacti wearing coats in the snow!  A big cactus can cost upwards of $2000 to replace so keeping them warm and alive is worth the effort.wrapping pipes is sometimes important.  It usually is only below freezing for a short time here so the week-long freezes that cause burst pipes here is rare but we do wrap our outdoor faucets just to be safe...the last thing we want is an emergency plumbing repair bill!even living in somewhere where it rarely gets very cold, you still need a bit of winter wear.  I saved some fleece jackets, a down coat, a hat, and gloves when we moved here and they get used a couple of times a year.  On the other hand, if you need these items they can be found cheap at the Goodwill because so many people donate these items when they move to Vegas!"},

{"title": "Five Things I've Recently Learned", "date": "Saturday, February 16, 2019", "text": "In no particular order...I have been baking forever.  Like since I was 5, when I got my first Easy Bake Oven.  Fast forward to now and how come I have only recently (in the last month or so) learned how to use baking parchment???  I saw some baking parchment at the dollar store and thought I would give it a try and now we use it literally every time we stick a pan in the oven!  I make a sticky Filipino dessert cake and it is always really hard to get out of the pan so I used the parchment and--wa la--the thing came out so easily and I hardly even needed to clean the pan.  Needless to say, while I am late to the baking parchment paper party, I now swear by the stuff!If you are looking for a temporary job, the US census is now hiring for the 2020 census.  Click here for more info.You might want to look through any old toys you have at your house (unfortunately I am a minimalist and get rid of stuff immediately if we are no longer using it).  This guy just sold an old video game for $100,150!We were walking through Costco today (I love their oatmeal--$8 for a giant bag of oats!) and we noticed so many things that are part of a smart home.  From your TV to your refrigerator to your Ring doorbell to a weather thermometer to lights to your thermostat--so many things are connected via wifi to make your home \"smart\"!  And now it looks like the big tech companies like Amazon and Google want to control your whole home...yikes!  While we do have our TV connected to wifi (for access to Netflix and Amazon movies) that will be the extent of it I think.  It kind of creeps us out that everything can be hacked and controlled by people we don't even know...eeekkk.Here's an article about doing a \"no buy\" year and I realized that since the end of last year, we have hardly bought anything except food.  This became apparent when hubby recently received his pension check and was able to put half of it in savings.  He uses a cash-back credit card to buy stuff (groceries, Goodwill, any other shopping we do) then pays it off each month when he gets his pension check.  He was really surprised when he went to transfer the money to pay the credit card and found we had spent less than half what we usually spend in a month; the rest went right into savings!"},

{"title": "10 Kinds of Food To Bring With You Each Day", "date": "Wednesday, February 6, 2019", "text": "I was kind of surprised to see the price for basic instant oatmeal when I went to Starbucks a few days ago.  $4 to $5 for a small thing of instant oatmeal and a couple raisins???  We are now firmly in the habit of bringing food and drinks from home these days and it is so easy and saves so much money I don't know why more people don't do this.  Here are the things we bring:Coffee (make it at home and bring it in a thermal drink container to keep it hot)Tea (I always have a few tea bags in my bag and usually bring my own hot water as well)Soda or juice (the same thermal drink containers will keep cold drinks cold for 10+ hours; it's cheaper to bring a soda from home than buying it from a vending machine)Bottled water (we buy bottled water by the case at Costco and I bring one each day with me for a fraction of the cost of buying one from a vending machine)Candy bars/chips/etc (again, buying these in bulk at Costco then bringing snacks with you instead of paying vending machine prices is a big money saver)Healthy snacks (I bake my own cookies or bring my own nuts/raisins/dates/apples/bananas/etc in small ziploc bags...super cheap and super easy to do)Breakfast (when we have to be out and about very early I will make oatmeal and bring it in a small insulated container or make a breakfast sandwich along with a piece of fruit and we re good to go all morning)Lunch (nearly every day I make us sandwiches to bring with us instead of eating out every day.  PB&J, BLT, cheese, hummus wraps...sandwiches are cheap and easy to make at home)Dinner (similar to lunch, if we will be out in the evening and don't want to go out to eat, I can toss together a homemade meal with baked potatoes, baked sweet potatoes, salad, or leftovers and bring it with us)Granola bars (I always have a few of these in my bag for times when I am hungry but didn't bring other food with me)When I think of how much we used to spend eating out--sometimes three meals a day--back when I was working, it kind of boggles the mind--so much money wasted!  Note, don't forget a fork and spoon and napkins/wet wipes.  Also, putting these things together gets much faster with a little practice!"},
{"title": "100 Retirement Tips", "date": "Tuesday, February 5, 2019", "text": "We are pretty much retired (hubby is fully retired, I am kind of retired but like to take gigs and other freelance jobs as they come up).  We did a little (very little) planning for retirement but so far we are pretty happy where we ended up!  I saw this post on Kim's blog and it reminded me that there are A LOT of things that go into (frugal) retirement planning.  Here are 100 tips to consider if you are heading towards retirement...HousingWhere, geographically, do you want to live?  We are happy with hot weather and no snow shoveling required!  In what sort of housing do you want to live?  House, condo, apartment, with your kids?  Each option has pluses and minuses; owning your own house requires maintenance costs like for a new hot water tank or roof or HVAC system, on the other hand, living in an apartment means non-stop rent increases usually.Plan ahead for when you aren't as mobile; many seniors chose single story ranch houses instead of two or three story houses with a lot of stairs for this reason.Do you want to live in a senior community with low maintenance homes and a community center or do you want to keep the family farm (working the family farm becomes exponentially more difficult as you age)?How are property taxes where you plan to live?  There can be several thousands of dollars difference between buying a house in one state (like Nevada where the taxes for houses are low) and Connecticut (where property taxes are un-freaking-believably high!).Does the place you plan on living have senior property tax rebates?  Many areas offer tax abatement programs for seniors which they can use on house and car taxes to cushion the financial impact of ever-increasing taxes.What kind of disasters are common to where you plan to live?  Obviously it becomes more difficult to deal with disasters like tornadoes and hurricane evacuations and major winter storms as you age so this is something to check into when deciding where to live.How much living space do you need?  We downsized quite a bit when we moved because I didn't want to continue cleaning a big house or hiring a housekeeping service.  My 88 year old friend finally decided it was time to downsize from a 5,000 square foot house to a 1,500 square foot house (!?!).  It's taking her a bit of time to get used to a smaller place but most people don't need so much space.Should you downsize or should you actually upsize?  If we would have thought about it before buying our house, we would have considered getting a place with a mother-in-law cottage to give us more options (we could live in the cottage and rent out the house or lived in the house and when we are old, used the cottage for a caretaker or for one of the kids to move in to help us in our old age).What changes do you need to do to your home to make it livable for the rest of your life?  Flooring that will wear for many years and not need changing out is one thing to consider.  We have a tile roof that has a 50 year lifespan so that should last us the rest of our lives.  We will add grab bars in the bathroom if they become necessary.  A quality interior paint job should last for year.Medical CareWhat kind of health insurance do you have now and how will this change as you retire?How will you pay for your health insurance in the future?  Many people switch to Medicare when they can but still need to pay for parts C and D as well as pay additionally for some medication costs and other things (this whole system is rather mind-boggling).How will you pay for medications?  This can become a huge issue for people as they age because insurance may not pay for everything and drug costs are sky-rocketing!Where will you get medical care?  This actually comes into play as you age because healthy young people can live anywhere but older, sicker people like to live closer to their healthcare providers and hospital services.Do you need long-term care insurance?  What would happen if you need long-term nursing home care or in-home care?  How would you pay for it?If you do take medications, make a plan for not getting them mixed up or overdosing (this actually happens quite a lot).  Hubby takes several medications daily so I have a written list of his medications, dosages, and when to take them.  I put his pills in those daily pill boxes so they are organized by pills to take in the AM and pills to take in the PM.  And I have a picture of each pill bottle on his phone so if he ever needs to recite his medications to a doctor or pharmacist he just has to show them the pictures.How can you keep yourself as healthy as possible while you age so you don't incur steep medical costs?  Daily exercise, a good diet, and monitoring your health metrics can go a long way towards keeping you healthy.Do you know some do-it-yourself medical care tricks?  Years ago most medical care was done at home with old fashioned remedies.  These still work for the common cold and basic illnesses (obviously get yourself to a hospital when it comes to high fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain, etc).Do you need to consider specialized medical situations?  I have friends that live in remote places and a couple who live on an island so they pay a small fee every year to the local air ambulance service in case they need to be evacuated.  For people who travel a lot, travelers health and medical evacuation insurance may be a good idea.One of the most common injuries/fatalities for seniors is falling.  Work on preventing falls with regularly updating your prescription glasses, wearing sensible shoes, not climbing ladders or doing other high-risk activities, doing exercises to increase your balance, reviewing your prescriptions so interactions don't cause dizziness or falls, and getting rid of fall hazards in your home.Living ExpensesYou need an emergency fund!  It isn't if but when an emergency will happen (a busted stove or air conditioning unit for example) and having cash to cover it usually goes a long way towards fixing or mitigating the emergency.Common living expenses like utilities and every other monthly bill you pay have nowhere to go but up so how will you pay continually rising bills while living on a fixed income?  I would love to get rid of our cars and just Uber around but hubby hates that idea (I really think it would be cheaper!).How secure are your retirement sources of income?  Social Security payments are pretty secure (for now) but pension plans can range from pretty secure to nearly bankrupt depending on the plan.  Can you develop multiple sources of retirement income?  I know people who have Social Security, a civil service pension, a military pension, Roth IRAs, a 401k, and even royalties coming in.  Needless to say that is a way better retirement plan than just hoping to subsist on a small Social Security check each month.Do you regularly look at each of your bills and see if there are ways to eliminate or reduce them?  I regularly check different companies to see if I can get lower home and auto insurance plans, I keep an eye on our local internet provider and switch to cheaper plans if they come available, and we have switched cell phone plans several times over the years to cut costs yet still meet our needs.Can you share living expenses?  Years ago the \"Golden Girls\" was a funny TV show but as housing and living expenses have increased, having roommates or living in a co-housing community is looking better and better when it comes to ways to cut down on living expenses.Do you have a fund for planned replacement costs for things that will eventually wear out?  Eventually you will need to replace shoes and clothing as well as towels and furniture and tires and maybe even your car.  Having a fund to pay cash for these items is a great way to stay out of debt.Note that where you live can have a huge impact on regular living expenses.  Some states have really high utility costs, in some places it costs a lot more for gas for your car than other places, food and meat and produce can range from cheap to very expensive...it pays to look into these costs as well when deciding where to live.What living expenses do you no longer need?  We used to have several cars, we went down to one car and now have two cars (only because hubby doesn't want to get rid of his van although we hardly ever use it).  We can easily live without cable TV as an OTA antenna works well here (unfortunately it costs less to have internet and cable TV bundled together than just internet so for now we have cable TV, otherwise we would be perfectly happy with just OTA TV).  The fewer things you need, the more money you can save on maintenance/storage/insurance/extraneous costs associated with these consumer products.How can you reduce the living expenses you can't get rid of?  When we first moved to Las Vegas we read our electric meter everyday after a particularly high electric bill and worked at doing things to reduce the bill like setting the AC higher or the heat lower, taking shorter showers, turning off appliances and lights when not in use, etc.DocumentsDo you have an up-to-date Will which is signed and notarized?Do you have an up-to-date Living Will which is signed and notarized?Do you have an up-to-date medical power of attorney document which is signed and notarized?Do you have all of your important documents (birth certificates, marriage and divorce paperwork, military paperwork, death certificates, deeds and titles, etc) in a safe place like a safe or safe deposit box?Do you have ALL of your documents (important documents, tax documents, photos, etc) scanned into your computer AND saved on an external drive which is saved off-site (so if your house burns down, both your computer and external drive with your backed up files won't all go up in smoke)?Do you keep a list of all of your important information (bank info, account info, passwords, creditor info, medical information, insurance and financial info, etc) on your computer as well as in a place where your executor can access it in the event of your death?Do you keep a list of things that expire (passport, driver's license, credit cards, car registration, etc) so that you will know in advance when to get these renewed so they won't lapse?Have you backed up all of your contact info (phone numbers, email addresses, etc) so that if you lose your phone you won't lose all of your contact information?Do you keep a list of all of your medical information (doctor's name, health history, current medications, allergies, health insurance info, DNR/POLST form, etc) where it would be easily accessible during a medical emergency?Have you went through your house with your camera/video camera on your phone and done a complete home inventory?  In the event of burglary or fire, you will have a simple way to submit your loss to the insurance company this way.Financial StuffHow is the overall tax burden where you live?  Whether your state has a state income tax or exempts tax on social security or your pension can make a big difference in the amount of money you keep in your pocket.Do you have a good credit score?  You may not use credit but if you do need to buy something like a house or car, having a good credit score can be a good thing.Do you have a couple of low-interest credit cards on hand?  While cash-only is a great way to live, having credit cards to use if needed is another good thing.Can you work?  Some older people like to work for fun and some need to work out of necessity so if either of these things are the case with you, having some good work skills/work history is a bonus when it comes to the gigs/jobs you can do during retirement.Do you know how to do online banking and pay your bills online?  This is both a convenience and a safe way to handle your money and it is pretty easy to learn if you don't know how to do it.Can you create multiple streams of additional income?  Have you ever tried bartering?  Have you tried reselling things online?  Have you ever had a garage sale?  Do you have a novel you are just itching to write which you can publish/sell online?  There are lots of fun and interesting ways to make a little extra money if needed.Do you have a firm no co-signing for loans of any kind policy?  If the kids have a crisis and need money, we give them what we can afford as a gift with no need for them to repay us.  We NEVER co-sign loans for anyone or give money as a loan since both of these thing can cause unending financial strife in the family.Do you go for all of the coupons/rebates/discount programs you can possibly find?  We love senior discounts and senior day at the movies.  We have taken advantage or freebies and rebates from our local utility companies.  We use coupons for everything from food to haircuts.  If there's a way to save money, we are all over it!Do you do your taxes on time and in full every year?  There are several in-person and online services for doing your annual taxes which are often free, especially for seniors.  If you should owe taxes, be sure to pay them in full or set up a payment program so you don't get even more penalties and interest added.Be debt free!!!!!!!  This can not be stated loud enough but when you are on a fixed income or headed towards living on a fixed income, being completely out of debt (house, car, credit cards, loans) is the only way to live!FoodDo you know how to cook and eat at home regularly?  This is a great way to save money AND eat healthier compared to eating out at restaurants.Do you regularly shop sales and loss leaders?  This is a good way to save money on food which will also allow you to stock your pantry on the cheap.If you do eat out, do you go to lunch instead of dinner (it's cheaper), use coupons (if available), and save half of your meal to take home (with the giant quantities of food served in restaurants, it's pretty easy to get two meals from one serving of restaurant food)?Do you have any food-related hobbies?  Fishing, hunting, gardening, and foraging are all great ways to eat well on the cheap and have fun at the same time.Have you checked out local alternative food options?  We love to shop in ethnic stores where the food is cheap and fresh, some people join CSA programs to receive regular orders of produce, and we used to buy fish and shellfish right off the boat when we lived in a seaside community.Do you cook in bulk?  It can be tiring to produce three complete meals a day but by cooking larger quantities and freezing some of what you make, you can have meals to last several days.If you are out and about often, have you considered taking meals and beverages with you?  We do this nearly everyday because it is cheaper and healthier to make coffee or take a drink and pack a sandwich as we are heading out the door instead of needing to hit up a restaurant everyday for a mid-day meal.Do you use the internet to expand your repertoire?  There are so many great recipes online as well as how-to videos.  You can even Google your favorite restaurant food and it is nearly guaranteed that someone has figured out how to replicate it complete with a video to show you how to make it!Have you considered the judicious use of Costco and Sam's Club?  We used to buy nearly everything in bulk when the kids lived at home but now that there is only the two of us, we only occasionally buy in bulk (generally big bags of oatmeal and rice and other items we are sure we will use up before it goes bad).One of the things we are known for is cooking for parties.  Cooking your specialties (in my case desserts and in hubby's case Asian food) is a great way to contribute to social events in a very inexpensive way.A Safety NetDo you know your neighbors and can you rely on them to help you during an emergency?Do you have family/friends who live near by or in the same city that you can rely on to help you during an emergency?Do you have family/friends anywhere in the country/world who you can rely on to help you during an emergency?Do you have food and supplies stockpiled to use in the event of an emergency like a snow storm or long-term illness or other situation when you can't get to the store for a week or more?Do you have a couple of places you could evacuate to if you need to leave your home at a moment's notice (like needing to evacuate if a hurricane is heading your way or if a tornado damages your home)?Do you have an emergency fund in cash that is safely stored in your home for use during an emergency if you can't get to the bank?Do you have an emergency fund in the bank that would cover six to twelve month's of living expenses?Do you have a list of service people you know are reliable to help you if needed (handyman, veterinarian, auto mechanic, etc)?Are you proactive in keeping things maintained so you don't end up in a crisis (like keeping your car maintained and the oil changed, changing your furnace filters, having your HVAC system checked annually, always keeping your gas tank at least half full, etc)?Are you well insured (life, health, auto, home, long-term-care) so a small problem doesn't turn into a major financial disaster for you?Keeping BusyAre there free and inexpensive entertainment options where you will retire?  We are fortunate that there are literally hundreds and hundreds of free and cheap entertainment options where we live, from movies and shows to community events and museums!Are you interested in volunteering?  Volunteers are always needed by so many community organizations and this is a great way to spend your time while helping others.Another great way to spend your days and improve your health is to see what kind of fitness activities are available where you live.  Bowling centers, community parks, gyms, skating rinks...by adding your fitness routine into the mix you will be healthy and entertained at the same time.If you have a hobby (or several hobbies), are there groups in place for this hobby where you will retire?  I love my walking group, my hiking group, my genealogy group, and there are literally several other hundred other groups in my city that meet up monthly from an astronomy club to a makerspace to knitters to scrabble players to romance writers...the list is endless!Check out senior centers in your area.  Ours have some great programs including a daily lunch, card games, classes, drop in centers, and several other things to keep seniors busy.Church is also important for many people.  If church is important to you, definitely check out your church options where you plan to retire.Get a library card!  Our library system is amazing.  Besides books and ebooks and music and movies available to check out, our wonderful library system offers events nearly every weekend, a genealogy library, classes on everything from learning English to using computers, as well as lots of kids programs.Even if you live in a not so busy place, you computer can open up a world of entertainment opportunities.  Netflix is of course entertaining.  So are gaming groups, YouTube videos to teach you literally everything, bulletin board communities, etc.You can always learn something new.  Our local university has free/cheap classes that are open to seniors, I recently took a free CERT class and got some great information as well as a big bag of emergency supplies just for attending, our county extension office has an ongoing series of classes for those who want to become Master Gardeners, and if you want to do something and there isn't an established group already, you can always set up your own meet up group.Parties are another fun way to spend your time.  Many of our social groups (bowling league, walking club, poker player friends) hold parties every now and then.  These are usually potlucks and a lot of fun!Crisis ManagementIf you need help call: 911 (emergency fire/police/ambulance), 811 (if you are going to dig up your yard and want your utility lines marked), 711 (connects to a relay operator for hearing and speech impaired), 611 (customer service number for your cell company), 511 (for road conditions), 411 (for directory assistance), 311 (for situations that are less urgent than calling 911), 211 (for social service help like information on food banks, homeless services, etc), 111 (not used in the US), 011 (for international dialing).If you need help, sign up for any social service program you qualify for.  If you need food, sign up for SNAP; if you need housing, sign up for senior housing; if you can't afford your medications, sign up for prescription assistance programs, etc.Find out what social service programs are available in your area for those in need and use them if you are in crisis including meal programs, food banks, home healthcare, homeless shelters, etc. If you belong to a special group, see what help is available to you.  Military members have several resources from VA services to free medical care, cheap home loans, and on-base services.  The Elks/Lions/Masons/etc are still active groups that help their member in need, and churches often have emergency assistance programs for their members and the community at large.Contact your local department of emergency management/Red Cross and see what kind of disaster services they offer.  Some offer free preparedness and first aid classes, while others offer evacuation shelters during a disaster and free apps to alert the community to impending emergencies.Make your own disaster plan.  Whether there is a natural disaster like an earthquake or an emergency evacuation due to a chemical spill, plan how you will respond ahead of time by creating a disaster plan.If you retire to an area with frequent weather emergencies, get a NOAA weather radio which will alert you when a tornado or hurricane is heading your way.Sign up for AAA.  Especially if you drive a lot and if you drive far distances, the knowledge that you can just call for help or roadside assistance is well worth the money this service costs.Up your security consciousness.  Seniors are often a target for robbery and other crimes simply because they are old and frail.  Use online and community sources to learn how to protect yourself physically and how to make your home more secure in order to prevent becoming a victim of crime.Protect yourself from financial disasters too.  Pull your free credit report annually and correct any mistakes, learn about putting a credit freeze on your accounts to protect yourself, and learn what to do if you become a victim of financial crime (unfortunately seniors are also a huge target for scams and identity theft).Other StuffShop the Goodwill and thrift stores.  This is my favorite place to shop and saves a boatload of money over buying retail!Consider joining AARP and other senior organizations if you find that the value is well worth the money.If you are lonely or just enjoy animals, consider adopting a pet from your local shelter.  Rescue animals are just as good as purebred animals from a breeder and make great companions!In the interest of not being a burden to your family, plan your death ahead of time. Decide on and pay for your death arrangements (funeral, burial, cremation, etc) to save your family from this difficult task.  Cleaning out years of stuff from your home and giving away valuables to important family members before you die is also a great idea.Use technology to help you age in place.  There are so many things that technology can do now that it boggles the mind.  Alexa can remind you to take your medications, you can control an entire home security system from your cell phone, and your family can easily use technology to check in on you to make sure you are all right if they don't hear from you (my friend's son put a camera in her living room that she waves at every morning to let her son know she is fine).Be sure to lock up drugs like opiod medications, guns, and money anytime you have guests, the grandkids, or service people in your home.  This prevents accidents as well as cuts down on crimes of opportunity if people see these valuable/dangerous things just sitting around in your home.Make it a point to stay active.  It can be easy to become a hermit if you don't have anyone like a boss telling you to be at work every day at a certain time.  By forcing yourself to get out and be active you will age better (social interaction has proven to be an important part of healthy aging).Know when to make significant changes in your life.  Determine when you should stop driving (we have already cut down significantly on driving at night), be proactive in staying up on your healthcare (including glasses, hearing aids, dental care, mental health care if needed, etc), and ask for help when needed (no one wants to be put in a \"home\" but assisted living can be the difference between aging well and suffering alone).Make sure to keep your brain active.  Whether you are doing crossword puzzles or sodoku, learning a new language with Duolingo or reading the Wall Street Journal everyday, keeping your brain active is another important component of healthy aging.Live wondrously.  If you want pink hair, dye your hair pink!  If you want to travel the world, go!  If you want to become a famous painter, paint--that's what Grandma Moses did at the age of 78!  Go.  Do.  Cool.  Stuff!"},
{"title": "5 Things From Today", "date": "Monday, February 4, 2019", "text": "In no particular order...It's hubby's birthday!  Today he is 70 years old (see photo above) and while it was a kind of quiet day with a nice lunch at an Indian Restaurant, we have another lunch planned for tomorrow, a party planned for Wednesday, and a dinner cruise planned for this weekend.  I really wanted to do a family reunion cruise for this major birthday but as a couple of my readers pointed out, going in to debt to pay for all of his kids and grandkids to come on the cruise is a dumb idea because debt is BAD.  And they were right of course, so as soon as I can save up to take everyone on a cruise we will go (and not a minute sooner!).Here are a whole bunch of places where you can download books and other literary works for free.Tomorrow is Chinese (Lunar) New Year.  There are lots of events happening in our city and if you have a large Chinese population where you live, there may be some Chinese New Year events happening that you can watch in your area.We are very happy that we can watch the snow happening now in our former city on TV rather have to actually be in it!And finally, in my \"law of attraction\" story for the day, something unusual happened yesterday.  I've been watching a lot of LOA videos recently and yesterday one of the videos pointed out that you are where you are at now due to what you have manifested in your life so far (the point being that you can manifest anything you want).  So I was thinking about what I have manifested so far and was pretty happy with my ordinary life and then we watched a talent show last night and this guy from Mongolia who speaks absolutely no English blew everyone away by singing a country song in English.  I was as shocked and amazed as the audience and hubby said \"but you do the same thing why are you surprised?\"  Years ago I shocked people in the same way--singing songs in Spanish, which I didn't understand, at a nightclub and singing songs in Tagalog (Filipino) that I didn't understand at nightclubs and parties, even on the radio and on stage with some famous people when we were in Manila once.  Hubby reminded me that after listening to a few people sing a popular Filipino song I said \"I can do that\", got up on stage, and belted out my first Tagalog song.  He said \"you have always set your mind to things--no matter how unusual or impossible--and made it happen.\"  OK that was my cue--and a great reminder--from the universe!  On a side note, after looking more into Mongolian music which wasn't even on my radar 24 hours ago, I now have a favorite Mongolian music group, The Wasabies!  Life works in strange ways :)"},

{"title": "10 Frugal Super Bowl Tips", "date": "Wednesday, January 30, 2019", "text": "The Super Bowl is coming up on Sunday and for many people, this is a pretty big deal.  The hubby and I aren't really sports fans but we will probably watch the game at home or at least catch the last quarter which is kind of the most exciting part of the game for people who don't really know football.  Here are some tips to enjoy the game and keep expenses down at the same time...Have your Super Bowl party at home (yours or someone else's).  There are a lot of places to watch the game here in Las Vegas but of course when you go to an establishment to watch the game, all of the beer and food you order can be super expensive.If you are watching with a bunch of people, make it a potluck so you won't be responsible to cook for and feed a lot of people; this saves time, effort, and money plus trying food others make is always a fun experience.  Be sure to make some sort of menu so you don't end up with 10 cases of beer and nothing else!Stock up on food, drinks, and snacks by buying loss leaders a week or so in advance.  Most of our grocery stores target their pre-Super Bowl ad towards the event by having sales on chips and steaks and beer and the like.Cooking for a crowd can be easy and simple and even inexpensive, depending on what you are cooking.  For example, cooking pork chops for a crowd can be expensive and time consuming but cooking a pork roast then making chopped pork sandwiches is simple and much less expensive.Make sure the food is easy to eat and not really messy (you don't want a food mess left behind on your sofa!).  Easy to eat finger foods are a good idea in addition to the main course.To get the best deal on paper plates, plastic utensils, and disposable cups, check out the Dollar Store (Costco also has pretty good prices when buying these items in bulk).Don't fall for the \"buy a new TV for Super Bowl\" advertisements.  If you are planning to buy a TV, have saved the money, and done the research to find the best deal that's fine but randomly deciding your TV isn't good enough to watch a three hour game is a bad reason for buying a major appliance.Offer variety--sparkling soda or sparkling water instead of beer; healthy food options mixed in with the not-so-healthy options, etc.You don't have to go all out on decor.  Some people do but really, as long as you have enough seating and a good amount of food, the money spent on football-specific party decor is kind of a waste of money.If there will be drinking at your party, don't let people drive home drunk.  Saving someone a $10,000 DUI is probably the best money-saving tip here.  Have them Uber home, give them a ride home, they can even get a Tipsy Tow in some places."},
{"title": "10 Random Money Things", "date": "Tuesday, January 29, 2019", "text": "I've come across a bunch of things related to money so thought I would share them with you...Found money!  Having had the shock of getting a late credit card bill (along with a late payment fee) for a credit card I never use, I decided to check all of my credit cards just to make sure they were all still at 0 where they belong.  I found that one was a cash back card and it had $101 waiting in the rewards section!  Yeah extra money :)And here are some more places to look for unclaimed money.If you like to write interesting lists, you can get paid $100 for doing so.  I LOVE making lists so I will definitely give this a shot.  More info here.Unfortunately the new rule that hospitals need to post their prices online so consumers can better compare costs isn't working so well.For those of you in the midwest to the East Coast, here's hoping you weather (no pun intended) the epic deep freeze heading your way (I can't even imagine what -40 degrees feels like!).  Here are some tips to keep your home protected from the storm.Have you heard of Flix Bus?  We have used Mega Bus and Bolt Bus several times before but my cousin now swears by Flix Bus--she said it is cleaner and cheaper than the other discount buses and it goes to more places.  I was shocked to see that a ride on the bus from Las Vegas to Laughlin, a small vacation town 90 miles to the south of us, was only $4.99!For those of you who use insulin (and are held financially hostage by our God-awful healthcare system in the US) if you are having trouble paying for expensive prescription insulin like this guy, I found out that Walmart has some of the cheapest insulin around.  This may not be the best option but it better than going without such a crucial drug.I'm pretty shocked that in this day and age parents (who are most likely vaccinated) decide NOT to vaccinate their kids.  Vaccines are much cheaper and safer than getting a deadly disease and paying for healthcare or in the worst circumstances, a funeral, for your kid.I do our taxes online so I put all of our W2s into the program and we will owe a few hundred dollars since hubby won several thousand dollars playing poker this year :(  Bummer...I always like it when we get some sort of refund check.  Here's where you can file your taxes online for free.Sunday is the Super Bowl.  There will be hundreds of thousands of tourists here to bet and party this weekend so yours truly will be avoiding all of the tourists areas"},
{"title": "Printer Problem Solved", "date": "Monday, January 28, 2019", "text": "Yesterday I went to print out a document only to find my printer was out of ink.  Not wanting to spend an arm and a leg on printer ink because I hardly ever use it which means I spend $50+ on ink cartridges only to let them dry up because I rarely print anything (boarding passes and tickets and other things are now usually just saved to my email and scanned on my cell phone), I needed a better (read, cheaper) fix for this problem.  So today we stopped by Office Depot and I found out that I can email my document to the printer at Office Depot, print out my document, and only pay 12 cents per page!  According to my calculations, for the price of new ink cartridges, I can make 416 copies at my local Office Depot.  Needless to say, it would probably take me 10 years to print 416 documents so from now on, I will just print anything I need at Office Depot and save the money of having my own printer at home."},

{"title": "Good News for Federal Workers!", "date": "Friday, January 25, 2019", "text": "The good news is that the government shutdown is over which is great for the many federal workers who haven't been paid for more than a month.  The not so great news is that the shutdown may resume in mid February.  I hope those who were impacted by the shutdown (actually I hope everyone) will do the following things:Pay their bills up to date; paying the minimum due on all debts.Pay off any loans they took out to cover their financial needs during this shutdown.Put any extra money they have in savings to help them in case the government is shutdown again in February.Work like crazy to get an emergency fund together that will cover two to six month's worth of bills.Look at every single bill they have and see if there is any way to reduce or eliminate it (cut cable in favor of an OTA antenna, get a cheaper cell phone plan, etc).Pay off their debts as quickly as possible.Establish multiple streams of income.Stockpile enough food and supplies to last at least a month (buy loss leaders, buy in bulk, etc).File their taxes as quickly as possible so they can get their tax refund back to help bulk up their emergency fund.None of us know when a problem may happen that will impact our income.  This shutdown came as kind of a surprise, especially the duration of said shutdown.  And many people have had the experience of going to work only to find the doors chained shut and their employer suddenly out of business.  It's a scary position to be in when you have less than $100 in your bank account and the paycheck you depend on to pay your bills and feed your family doesn't come in for weeks and weeks so it just makes sense that we should all be proactive to take care of our financial situation before a crisis occurs."},

{"title": "Financial Preparedness", "date": "Friday, January 18, 2019", "text": "If anything should reinforce the need for financial preparedness, it is the ongoing government shutdown that has simultaneously not paid nearly a million government workers for a month and at the same time, made it impossible, per their work contract, to work elsewhere so they can earn money to pay their bills.  I can't even fathom being told to come to work but we won't pay you for a month or longer!Even though this sort of forced-to-work-but-not-get-paid scenario may not happen to you personally, something similar like a major disaster or major recession or the sudden closure of the business you work at could have a similar impact on your finances so it behooves everyone to be financially prepared for such a situation.  This means...Get out of debt as quickly as possible.  Pay off the house, the car, the credit cards, and any other debt you have so that if there is a financial catastrophe, your only bills will be for utilities.Save up an emergency fund that will cover six months to a year of your monthly bills (which, you can imagine, will be easier to do if your monthly bills are utilities and food and gas and not a mountain of debt payments!).Stockpile a month or more worth of food.  Within days, people were already in line at food banks to get food to help them through the shutdown.  If you have a good amount of food at home (rotated through the food that you usually eat so it doesn't expire) you could go for days or weeks without going to the grocery store (also good for those times when you are ill or there is a massive storm and you can't get to the store).Do the occasional no spend week and see how that goes. Get used to not spending money every single day for coffee and lunch and other random purchases.Get in the habit of paying your bills ahead of time.  We pay our car insurance every six months, our HOA every six months instead of monthly, and our homeowners insurance annually.  With these bills paid ahead, we don't have to worry about them for months at a time.Also stockpile supplies you regularly use.  Toilet paper, soap, shampoo, etc. buy these things when they are on sale so that you will both save money on these necessary items and have plenty in storage in case you can't afford to buy them during a financial crisis.Know the rules.  Know the rules about taking money from your 401k during a financial crisis, know the requirements to keep your medical insurance in affect during a crisis, know if you can or can't accept other work during a shutdown event, etc.Have cash on hand.  In addition to an emergency fund, having actual cash stashed at home can cover small emergencies (like needing to fill up the gas tank before a storm).Consider creating multiple sources of income.  Doing side gigs or starting a small business out of a hobby can ensure that there is always a stream of income coming in.  Even if it doesn't match the income from your main job, it's something to help you pay the bills.Have an emergency plan.  If you suddenly find yourself without an income, consider taking some drastic steps to cut expenses (pulling kids out of daycare and watching the at home, shutting off cable TV, only driving a couple days a week to save gas, changing your cell phone plan to a cheaper plan, etc)."},

{"title": "10 Ways to Save Money On Eating Out", "date": "Wednesday, January 16, 2019", "text": "We tend to eat out at restaurants probably more often than most people simply because we live in Las Vegas and there are restaurants everywhere.  Plus there are only two of us so it isn't like we are hauling the entire family out every time we go to a restaurant so it isn't that expensive.  There are, however, many things we do to cut down on the cost of eating out...We always order regular water to drink instead of soda (we don't really drink soda) or alcohol (we don't drink alcohol at all).We don't order appetizers (the entree itself is already more than enough food) or dessert (usually way overpriced and I can bake better than most frozen then unfrozen restaurant desserts).We often split one entree--and still have leftovers to bring home.  These days an entree isn't a single serving of food but a 2000 calorie extravaganza that would feed an entire family in most poor countries.  We go out for lunch instead of dinner.  The food and the portions are usually about the same but there is a significant price increase for the same meal at dinner time!We use coupons and ask for discounts (senior discount, military discount) when available.  Why not take advantage of a good deal?We generally eat for free!  This is pretty specific to Las Vegas but hubby likes to play poker and for each hour he plays, he gets one or two dollars worth of \"comps\" to spend at casino restaurants which means most of the places we eat at are casino-related and paid for by comps.When someone wants to give us gifts, we ask for restaurant gift cards instead of knick knacks.  These are much more useful and when buying these cards at certain times of the year, the purchaser can get their own free bonus gift card for themselves.We don't go to high end restaurants.  There are plenty of places here where people pay $100+ per person for a meal.  I simply am too cheap (frugal?) to spend that much on one meal.  First, I'm not a foodie, as long as something is reasonably edible I'm happy with eating it, and second, for $250--the cost for both of us to go to one of these high end restaurants--I could buy an entire month's worth of food at the grocery store!We save more \"expensive\" restaurants (like $15 to $20 per person...that's expensive to us) for special occasions.  Yes, we can afford to eat at these places more often but spending so much money is like a major purchase to us so we save these sorts of places for birthdays and anniversaries. We generally try to avoid fast food.  There are fast food restaurants on every corner here but, while the food may be cheap, it really isn't healthy to eat on a regular basis so we tend to make food at home and bring it with us when possible (sandwiches, wraps, tacos, even pizza is simple enough to make at home)."},

{"title": "100 Tips for Stretching Your Food Dollars", "date": "Monday, January 14, 2019", "text": "Needless to say, I am pretty worried about the nearly one million people who aren't getting paid right now during the government shutdown.  I will be even more worried if food stamps don't go out next month--43 million hungry people isn't a sight I can even imagine!  If you or someone you know is in need of free or frugal food resources consider the following ideas (note that if you don't qualify for some programs--or some programs aren't available at the present time--try reapplying if your circumstances change or when programs, like food stamps, begin accepting applications again):Apply for food stamps (also called the SNAP program).Apply for WIC (this is different than food stamps).Go to a food bank/food pantry in your local area.Ask at a local church for food assistance.Sign your kids up for free or reduced meals at school (these are often served during summer vacation as well).Call 211 and see what sort of food resources are available in your community.Find out if there are prepared meal programs you can go to (like dinners at the Salvation Army, etc).Shop at the $1 store (grains are cheap, skip the cheap junk food there).Shop at ethnic stores (things like grains, spices, and staple foods are often cheaper than at regular grocery stores).See if there is a CASA program near where you live (this allows you to support a local farmer and receive baskets of locally grown food each week).Shop farmer's markets and swap meets that have food stands (you usually get the best deals late on Sunday when farmers are packing up to go home and will often discount food so they don't have to take it back home with them).Learn how to forage for local food (berries, nuts, green, tree fruit, mushrooms, etc).See if there is a gleaning organization in your area (these programs allow people to go to farmer's fields after harvest and take any produce that was left behind).Similarly, if you see a farmer's field that has recently been harvested, you can skip the gleaning organization and just ask the farmer if you can glean any leftovers.Shop loss leaders at your local grocery stores (these are really cheap items used to draw shoppers into the store).Grow a garden if you can (seeds can often be found cheap or even free in some cases).  If you don't have space at your home, see if there is a P-Patch/community gardening area in your community.Buy in bulk at Costco or Sams Club if possible (if you don't have a membership, maybe a friend will take you as a guest).Take the family to Costco on the weekends (it seems like the free samples are a major source of nutrition for some families judging by how many times they hit up the sample tables).If you need a job/part time job, consider working at a restaurant that will provide you a free meal during your shift.Attend events where there will be free food (parties, community meetings, grand openings, etc).Consider fishing, shell fishing, and/or hunting to stock your freezer (there is usually a cost for equipment to get started which you may be able to borrow or find cheap, as well as the cost for licenses).See if an organization you belong to has a food pantry/free meal program (senior centers, food pantries at schools and colleges, etc).If you are a veteran, see if your local military base/veteran's service center has free food resources.  Note that many restaurants also give vets free meals on Memorial Day and Veteran's Day.Always ask for discounts at grocery stores and restaurants (some grocery stores give seniors a 10% discount on certain days, many restaurants give military folks a discount, etc).Offer to work for food (farms, restaurants, even individual homeowners may have odd jobs you could do for a meal).Dumpster dive for food (Google this topic for lots of how-to information).Learn how to cook from scratch (you can stretch your food dollars quite far this way).Consider going vegetarian (or vegetarian-ish); beans, rice, and legumes are often cheaper than meat and dairy plus they are very filling.Use reddit to find food resources (this includes r/frugal, r/eatcheapandhealthy, r/randomactsofpizza).Stop by mom or grandma's house for a meal (and ask to take home leftovers).Ask for gift cards (like for Walmart or a local grocery store) for birthdays and Christmas.Buy discount gift cards for Walmart or local grocery stores online.Shop sales and discount racks (like discounted meat or bakery items) at your local grocery store.If you can't afford to buy in bulk--like buying a 50 pound bag of rice for $30--go in with friends to buy the item and split it; this is often cheaper than buying smaller bags at a regular grocery store.Shop seasonally (apples are cheaper in the fall, watermelon is cheapest in the summer, baking products are cheaper around the holidays, and a whole turkey can be found highly discounted around Thanksgiving and Christmas).Shop bulk bins at the grocery store (always compare prices to ensure you aren't paying more than buying the item in a package).Always check unit prices of grocery items to ensure you are paying the lowest prices.Sign up for birthday freebies (this will often give you a week or more of free food items).Use food coupons that you find in store ads and in your junk mail.Make snacks instead of paying full price in the office vending machines (a 99 cent cake mix will make enough desserts/snacks for a week, ditto popcorn).Skip the $5 fancy coffee shop coffee and make your own at home (a $5 can of coffee will make enough coffee for a month or more).Download apps for various food places (these usually provide free food just for downloading the app).Look for discount food offers in your local area (Ikea has a full breakfast for $1 and free coffee too, Little Caesars has very cheap pizza, Del Taco has 50 cent tacos).Download supermarket apps which often give you even bigger discounts on groceries than what you see in their sale ad (an example, last week my local grocery store had eggs for $1.99 regular price, 99 cents on sale, and 49 cents if you use the store app).Shop at food discounters--like Grocery Outlet--which often sell over run products and items that are getting close to their expiration date.Learn to make soups and stews, this stretches your groceries further.Always eat leftovers; don't let them decompose in the back of the fridge.Ditto keeping up with perishables that go bad quickly; if you can't eat them before they go bad, cook them up and freeze them to eat at a later date.Learn how to cook ethnic food (food from poor countries is often grain-based, is made with cheap ingredients, and is pretty filling).Let friends and family know you are always on the look out for free and cheap food (they may remember this when they come back with a catch from fishing or are cleaning stuff out of their pantry that they don't want).Consider cultivating unique foods (like making sprouts, growing mushrooms, keeping bees, etc).Ask local homeless folks where to find free food (many are \"in the loop\" so to speak and have lots of insider info on this topic).Google the name of your town/city/county/state and free food and see what resources pop up.Google eat for $1 a day food challenge.  Plenty of people have done this sort of challenge then written about it which can provide you even more ideas for cheap eating.Use social media to ask for food help (I've seen many people do this on Facebook and their local sub reddit and often complete strangers will come through with assistance).Google how to stretch your food dollars (new articles and posts are constantly being added on this topic).Eat basic food (oatmeal has fed generations, it isn't fancy but it is cheaper than a bacon/eggs/pancakes breakfast).Cut back on your serving sizes (what people consider a \"normal portion\" is actually pretty huge compared to only a decade or so ago).Try to avoid highly processed food (things like Lunchables are a huge waste of money when you can make the same thing yourself for a fraction of the price).Invest in tools that will make bulk cooking faster and easier (things like a bread machine, slow cooker, Insta Pot, etc can often be found at thrift stores for the fraction of the cost of the item new).Look at the price of a food item then determine if you can make it from scratch even cheaper (if milk is on sale, you can often make yogurt out of this much cheaper than buying actual yogurt, pizza is often cheaper to make from scratch than carry out, fried rice literally costs pennies to make over the cost of buying it at a Chinese restaurant, etc).Buy the cheapest version of a food item.  Dried beans are cheaper than canned beans; frozen peas are cheaper than canned peas and much much cheaper than fresh peas usually,Learn how to make stir frys.  This is a cheap way to use up small amounts of vegetables and, served over rice, make a cheap yet filling and tasty meal.Grow your own herbs.  You can grow many herbs on a window sill and growing your own can be cheaper than buying the dried kind at the grocery store.Buy containers (ziploc bags, insulated coffee cups, plastic sandwich containers) and always bring your meals and snacks with you instead of hitting up a restaurant.Buy your food and snacks at a supermarket instead of at a convenience store; convenience stores are almost always much more expensive than any other kind of store.Ask your oldest relative their old fashioned cooking tips.  My grandmother always saved bacon drippings to use for frying other things, lard was cheap and used much more than refined cooking oil, a loaf of bread was made into croutons, bread pudding, and even the crumbs were put to use for breading fish.Learn how to preserve food so that if you get an abundance of one type of item you will be able to use it at a later date.  Dehydrating, canning, freezing, jam making, pickling, smoking...there may be an initial cost but preserving the harvest/processing food when you can get it really cheap, is a great way to stretch your food dollars.Drink water.  Soda is over-priced sugar water.  Juice isn't as good as eating the actual fruit.  And many people get by just fine without milk.If you must have a special beverage, see if you can make it yourself.  A cappuccino machine may be spendy, but it's less expensive than going to a coffee shop every day.  Ditto the popular soda machines that allow you to make soda water and flavored soda at home.Check out cookbooks from your local library (or search for recipes online) to learn how to improve your cooking skills and increase you repertoire.Instead of hosting an entire party, consider putting together social events that feature a potluck where everyone brings food to share.Ask for samples.  Many stores offer all kinds of samples just for the asking--from the deli and bakery to the cheese shop and produce sections.Skip a meal.  Most people won't suffer damage from not eating three or more times a day.  If you get up late, eat a late breakfast, skip lunch, then eat dinner--you save the cost of an entire meal this way.If you do eat at a restaurant, go for lunch, it's cheaper than dinner.  Get water instead of a drink, skip dessert which is usually over priced, and, if the serving is huge, take half of it home to eat for another meal.Fall back on cheap processed foods but not for the long term.  Ramen is cheap and it's OK occasionally but it is full of sodium and empty calories.  Vienna Sausages are cheap and OK occasionally, but again, they aren't the healthiest thing to eat.Also keep a stockpile of cheap, nutritious foods like eggs, bananas, carrots, cabbage, etc.  These are better for you to eat long-term.Ideally you can drink your tap water (be sure to bring your water bottle, filled up at home, with you everywhere).  If your tap water isn't very good consider getting a Brita filter pitcher.  Bottled water should be a last resort but you can get 5 gallons of water from dispensers in front of grocery stores much cheaper than individual bottles.If you have a lot of people to feed, Google for cheap recipes that will feed a crowd.  Pasta meals are cheap and feed a lot of people, ditto taco bars, casseroles, and big salad dishes.Buy a whole cooked chicken from your local grocery store (or ideally from Costco where these chickens are cheap and big).  You can literally make a dozen meals from one of these chickens (roast chicken, chicken tacos, chicken soup, chicken salad sandwich, chicken pot pie, etc).Attend cooking classes if you have the opportunity.  A friend of mine, a retired dietitian, volunteers her time to teach cooking classes at our local food bank where she teaches people how to cook with lentils and barley, and other items that come in their food bags that they may not be familiar with.Ask friends to teach your their best recipes.  I've learned how to make tortillas and tamales from scratch from a family in Mexico, how to make the best bread from a Kurdish refugee woman, how to make inexpensive food look appealing in Japan, and how to use pieces of a pig that one would think would be thrown in the waste bin to make delicious stews in the Philippines.  Put aside a bit of extra money to use when you find a great deal on food.  You never know what kind of amazing, random deals you will find when you go shopping.  One day I walked out of the grocery store with two whole salmon for $1 each (no idea why they were so cheap), another time there was a 20 pound bag of carrots for $3.  If you run across a great deal--stock up!Make a grocery price book so you will know if you are getting good deals while shopping.  You can't remember the best price for every grocery item you buy but with a price book, you will.Also make a grocery shopping budget and preferably keep an envelope of cash to be used for groceries only.  Using a credit card makes it too easy to buy extra stuff (not to mention making it too easy to fall into credit card debt) but with cash you will be intimately aware of how much money you are spending on food.Consider intermittent fasting.  This is actually a \"hot\" eating trend right now which is supposed to lead to better health and increased longevity.Consider bartering for food.  Whether you are trading your homemade bread for eggs from a local farmer or trading your home-grown pumpkins for a bag of shellfish with a buddy, learning how to barter is a great way to increase your food supplies.Join a food co-op or start your own.  It's a bit of work but having a dozen people pitching in money to buy restaurant-sized quantities of food is a good way to stretch your food dollars.Cook in bulk and freeze the resulting meals for future eating.  When people are tired and overworked and stressed, it is too easy to splurge on a meal.  By taking a day each weekend or each month and cooking 20 servings of a meal instead of one serving of a meal, you can easily stretch your food dollars and your time.If you must have meat, consider the cheapest way to get it.  Buying meat on sale at the store is one way, buying a side of beef may be a cheap option too, buying meat at Mexican or Asian stores may be inexpensive (especially if you know how to break down an entire animal--buying whole pigs is a thing at Asian markets), grinding your own hamburger allows you to make a higher quality burger for cheaper, etc.Make food \"fun\" for the family.  Going on a picnic, cooking over a small barbecue grill, roasting hot dogs over a bonfire...the food may be cheap but the presentation can make eating a luxe event.Cut out vices--alcohol, junk food, fast food--if your vice is costing you money and not helping your health, consider cold-turkey quitting.When you do go out to eat, stock up on single-serve condiments (ketchup packets, mayo packets, hot sauce packets, etc).  This may be a fine ethical line, but a couple packets here and there shouldn't be a problem.Don't fall off the frugal food wagon when traveling.  People spend a ridiculous amount of money on food when they come to my city for vacation, they would be far better off to take an Uber to the local grocery store/Walmart/99 cent store to buy some inexpensive food and snacks for their hotel room so they aren't spending an arm and a leg for each meal of the day.  Be sure to Google cheap eats for your destination to find local tips and tricks for eating on a budget.If you absolutely can't spend much on food, mono eating can be a short-term solution.  A loaf of bread, a jar of jam, and a jar of peanut butter can make a week's worth of meals in a pinch.  The same with a bunch of bananas and a bag of potatoes.  This isn't a great option but at least you won't starve.If you need specialized food, consider making it yourself.  Instead of expensive baby food, look for recipes to make it yourself.  There are even recipes for making Ensure at home.Make boring food interesting.  Sliced zucchini is kind of blah but spiralized zucchini is much more interesting.  Cauliflower is kind of meh but there is a new trend of making cauliflower \"steaks\".  Hint, it's just sliced cauliflower.Clean out your pantry regularly and donate food to those in need.  Even frugal people end up with food they don't eat in the back of the pantry so be sure to pass on food that others could use.Consider living elsewhere.  Obviously this isn't possible for many but moving from an area with a high cost of living/high food prices to an area with a low cost of living/low food prices can make a significant impact on your food budget.  Friends in Canada and Japan are often shocked by the low cost of food in our area.If you live in a food desert, consider other options for getting inexpensive, quality food.  In many poor areas, there may be a dozen liquor stores and a similar number of bodegas or corner stores but not a single place to get good, cheap regular food.  Look at the cost to take a bus to a better shopping area, buy your food, then Uber home, look at ordering from Amazon, get a ride with a friend when they go shopping, etc."},

{"title": "All I Have Is All I Need", "date": "Thursday, January 10, 2019", "text": "The SIL left a small pile of $100 bills on the table for us (she does this everywhere she goes, showering people in cash and expensive gifts, she is quite generous).  Hubby gave me half the money and asked what I was going to buy with it.  After thinking about it for a few minutes, I said nothing.  There is absolutely nothing I need or want and for some reason I have felt like that for more than a month.Of course I need to get my car paid off so the money will most likely go there but I think this may be the first time in my life that I feel like I don't want or need to shop.  We have bought groceries a couple of times since the beginning of the year but I haven't bought anything else and haven't even looked at Deal News or Tech Bargains or REI and Best Buy Deal of the Day pages or looked at any other online shopping since before the end of the year.Why the sudden change?  I have no idea.  It may be psychological since I don't have a job and am still trying to decide what to do to earn money so the thought of spending money is probably not even top of mind right now.  But I also don't have a shopping list which I usually keep (lists of things like toiletries or shoes or other things I want), and I don't feel the \"pull\" of going to stores or the desire to buy anything (I've also kicked the caffeine habit so there is no daily stop by Starbucks or Baskin Robbins!).Needless to say, this is a good thing and I hope the \"don't want to buy anything\" feeling continues for a good long while!"},
{"title": "It Was Free...", "date": "Wednesday, January 9, 2019", "text": "Today I was wondering what my fun/free/frugal thing would be since we had no plans other than for hubby to go bowling with his league and as I was walking through a building to go pay my HOA payment, I noticed a guy sitting at a table with a pile of pens/lanyards/etc as well as information on the college he was promoting.  Usually I walk right by these sorts of things but I saw the lanyards and I thought \"hmmm those are probably free\" and since I had no other plan today I thought \"hmmm this would be something to blog about\" so I went up to the table and had a nice conversation with the guy and I asked for a lanyard and he said sure, take one!  Obviously this isn't life changing, but the point of this year is to be proactive to do fun things, to get free things, and to do frugal things and walking up to a stranger and striking up a conversation was both interesting (the guy was very nice and knew a lot about this school, I'd never heard of it) and it scored me a free thing.  Now I'm having visions of 'One Red Paperclip'!On another fabulously free note, here is a list of 1150 free movies which you can get online."},

{"title": "A Few Words on Volunteering", "date": "Tuesday, December 11, 2018", "text": "One thing I've noticed over the past decade is the steep drop off in people volunteering for various causes.  Maybe because I am living in a big city now instead of a small town?  Maybe because the lack of volunteers is glaringly obvious because our 60 year old volunteers from a decade ago are now 70 years old and cutting back/quitting their volunteer activities due to a variety of reasons?Years ago it seemed like volunteering was something everyone did.  People of all ages--from kids to seniors--seemed to volunteer for everything from school and church activities to community events and hobby activities.  I remember my grandmother volunteering, my mother volunteering, and as soon as I was old enough, I volunteered which carried through until now when I still volunteer for several causes and activities.Unfortunately, I've also noticed that in many of my clubs and community activities, I am usually the youngest volunteer and the average age of participants is around 70+ years of age!  And this isn't just a problem around here.  This pastor wrote an obituary for the demise of his church's annual lutefisk dinner, and finding volunteer EMTs is an ongoing problem for many of the EMS agencies that I work with (you really don't want a 70 year old volunteer EMT on one end of your gurney and a 75 year old volunteer on the other!).I'm not sure what the problem is other than people's attention is on other things (working? staying home online?) but in volunteer circles it is a big concern (examples here, here, and here).  I know that people have to work hard for the money they earn and may be tired after a day of working and not want to get involved in anything they aren't getting paid for but there are a lot of good things about volunteering including good experience to put on your work resume, the opportunity to help those in need, getting some cool bonuses for volunteering (I volunteered for a couple of days at a genealogy conference then got to attend the rest of the conference for free), and the opportunity to learn new things (I started out learning web design for a non profit then used those skills to start my own business!).Hopefully something will change and volunteerism will see a resurgence where more people come out and help those in need in their communities!"},

{"title": "Alternate Living Arrangements", "date": "Sunday, December 9, 2018", "text": "I came across this post over at Lorraine's blog about wanting to move...somewhere, anywhere.  I totally know the feeling.  When we left Seattle I was super happy about leaving--the relentless grey skies and rain for six months out of the year were finally getting to me.  Fast forward to now and we live in Las Vegas with relentless sunshine (which is awesome).  But we also live in a city that grew by 50,000 in ONE YEAR and it is getting way too crowded here and, like Lorraine, living in the middle of nowhere on acres of land with our house right in the middle is looking better and better!As all of hubby's siblings are retiring and the kids are transitioning too (one wants to live closer to her first grandchild--hubby's great grand child, one retired from the military and decided to put down roots in a small town, another moved across country but only kind of likes their new town, and another lives in a state with wickedly high taxes) and the questions of where (and how) to live has been a hot topic around here.  To date we have considered:Van living.  Being a van-dweller is popular since it is so cheap (all you need is a van) and portable (you can drive a van anywhere) but I just can't see the both of us squished into a van and having to find public restrooms/showers to use every single day.RV living.  Another popular way to cut down the price of housing and be very portable at the same time.  We had an RV before and while it was fun, it seems like things were always breaking--even with a brand new RV--and there were always expensive repairs to make.  Also the value of an RV drops like a rock and I kind of like the opportunity to build equity in a house.Living in senior housing like a condo or a house in a senior community.  We lived in our cousin's condo when we first moved to Las Vegas and I really hated it (I'd never lived in an apartment or condo before so it was a new experience).  We could hear people walking--more like stomping--above us and the neighbors smoked which seemed to come into our place...ick.  Many of our friends own homes in a senior retirement community (Sun City Anthem) and while it looks nice, it also looks like God's waiting room--kind of like a cruise (organized activities, golf, clubs for every topic under the sun) that never ends.Buy another house somewhere else.  This would be the most likely option although we can't agree where to move to.  I would like a house on acreage in the middle of nowhere and hubby loves all of the amenities of a city....so it's a stalemate at the present time.  Owning a house is good for building equity but I'm getting tired of things breaking (so far we have replaced the hot water tank, the microwave, the refrigerator, the washer and dryer...it will be a continual expense to do this every ten years on a fixed income!).Shared housing.  I always was a fan of the Golden Girls (although the horror of having roommates during college is still in the back of my mind!) so the idea of buying a larger house and having roommates is another idea we have discussed.  Of course we would be very picky about who the roommates would be (one of the daughters would be a perfect roommate, one of the sons would not be, one of hubby's sisters and her husband would be great roommates, another sister would be a definite no).  This would allow us to have a bigger, nicer house but with others to help pay the mortgage and utilities as well as lend a helping hand with bigger projects like yard work.  Obviously the finances and divvying up of chores could get complicated.  Another thought was to have one or more of the kids move in (and pay a small rent and part of the utilities) so they can take care of us when we get old and then they can just keep the house after we die (since it is in our wills to go to them anyway), but we also like our privacy.I think this topic will become a huge issue in the future as housing prices continue to skyrocket but incomes are either fixed (seniors), or stagnate (for many average workers).  People are continually looking for ways to cut housing costs (does it really make sense for one person to have an entire house to themselves?) yet privacy and autonomy are pretty important in our culture (in hubby's culture it is almost unheard of for just one person to live in a house by themselves). The moving saga continues..."},
{"title": "Why I Love to Cook at Home", "date": "Saturday, December 8, 2018", "text": "This evening we had homemade vegan enchiladas for dinner (I was going to take a picture to go with this post but while the enchiladas tasted great, they weren't very photogenic!).  Even though we live in the land of great restaurants, I still much prefer to cook at home because...It's cheaper.  For a few dollars we had a big meal for two (with leftovers).Leftovers.  I like having a complete meal already made and waiting in the fridge which means leftovers fit the bill!It's healthier.  Restaurants tend to pour loads of fat, salt, and sugar into their food to up the taste, but while the food tastes great, a 2000 calorie meal is really unhealthy.  At home you know exactly what you are getting in your food and can customize it yourself (lower fat, no salt, etc).It's good practice.  You get good at cooking by practicing (a lot).  The more you cook, the better you will get at it (usually).You get to make exactly what you want.  Many restaurant meals are a big hunk of meal with a couple of tiny sides.  I prefer to skip the meat and love sides so when I cook it is usually a tiny piece of meat for hubby and a half dozen sides.It can be quick.  I go to a restaurant to eat but some places want to stretch out the meal for ages, at home I can cook a complete meal in under 10 minutes if necessary.It can be an artistic endeavor too.  While I don't have an artistic bone in my body, I can whip up some fabulous cakes and pastries.  Baking is my kind of art.You can try new things.  Most restaurants serve standard generic food but if you shop at good grocery stores you can try a dozen different kinds of lettuce, pick up heirloom tomatoes at a farmer's market, and try a dragon fruit or durien for dessert.It's more sanitary.  I worked in restaurants during high school and college and cleanliness wasn't high on anyone's priority list.  You can't imagine what happens to your food before it gets to your table (our nightly news has a 'Dirty Dining' segment and it will make you never want to eat out again!)."},
{"title": "10 Things for This Weekend", "date": "Friday, December 7, 2018", "text": "It's going to be a busy weekend...I need to find Christmas gifts for my friend and her family in Japan and get them ready to be mailed on Monday.  The gifts need to be really lightweight as the postage to mail them to Japan is incredibly expensive (a big-sized padded mailing envelope costs around $30 to mail!).Also I will buy postage stamps when I go to mail the gifts because the price is supposed to go up in January.There are rodeo people and rodeo events all over town so we may catch some live rodeo action at the Southpoint this weekend.I also need to do a couple of volksmarches (10k walks) this weekend because I want to use up my free walk coupons by the end of the year!I've got work to do for my biggest client including some end of the year stuff.  On another note, now that her job is back to being secure, I told her I would definitely need a raise by the end of the year or I would have to quit.  I feel like I am doing a lot of work and am not adequately compensated--she agreed but the raise has to be approved by her Board of Directors.  So by the end of the year I will either be jobless (eeekkk) or have a nice raise and retroactive pay from last July since the original deal was for me to get a raise back in July--the beginning of the fiscal year--which kind of went off the rails during their budget kerfuffle.I need to work on developing a couple of different streams of income because I will need to prepare in case I don't have a job by next month!We may drive out to Oatman this weekend.  We went there last year and it was a fun thing to do for Christmas because people decorate the desert shrubs for miles along the highway which leads to this small town about two hours from Las Vegas.There are more Christmas movies on the agenda!  So far we have watched a Christmas movie each evening since Thanksgiving.  Most have been pretty good!We will make out Christmas cards for the kids and grandkids then send them next week.  We have been really frugal the last five weeks so we will be able to give hubby's entire Social Security check which is coming in next week to the kids for the holiday.We need to renew our state park pass which expired last month.  At $30 for a senior pass, this is a great deal since regular one-time entrance to a state park is $10."},
{"title": "50 Ways My Grandparents Survived the Great Depression", "date": "Thursday, December 6, 2018", "text": "I saw this article today on how the writer's grandparents survived the Great Depression.  While these are general tips, here is a list of 50 specific ways that my grandparents, who were born in the early 1900s and were young adults during the 1930s, survived the Great Depression:They paid cash for everything.  They didn't have credit cards back then and taking out a loan was a HUGE deal, so my grandparents operated on a cash-only basis their entire lives (later they did get a mortgage for their last house).They always had a big garden and grandma processed everything by canning/freezing/pickling/jam making/etc.Their hobbies were hunting, fishing, clam digging, bee keeping, and sewing, among other things.  Their hobbies were fun but also useful for everyday survival, like putting food on the table on the cheap.They bought used whenever possible.  I don't remember my grandparents every having a new car.  Used cars, used trucks, used farm equipment, buying new was a really really rare thing.  Even grandma's prized hard-wood dining set was bought at an estate sale!They worked at whatever jobs came along.  Grandma worked at a sewing mill during the war, on the election board, as a local babysitter and house sitter, etc.  Granddad was a welder, a horse trainer, played in a band every Saturday night (grandma took tickets at the door), was a farmer, etc.  If there was a way to make money, they would jump on the opportunity. They helped out people whenever possible.  Living in a rural area it was the norm to help other people out as you could, and they would bring garden produce and home-made baked good to the elderly, ill, and poor families in the neighborhood.They didn't go out and rarely left the farm expect for Saturday nights during and a little after the war to run a dance hall in town.  They didn't go out for dinner, go out for coffee, or go shopping unless they absolutely needed to buy something specific.All food was cooked at home--breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and a thermos of coffee for granddad when he was out at work--every single day.They saved EVERYTHING.  Magazines, string, aluminum foil, reusing gift wrap and re-purposing cards (grandma would cut the front half of the card off and make it a holiday post card).  I didn't know there was such things as fancy glasses as we always used jam jars for drinking at their house.They bought things that held its value (guns, guitars, a sewing machine, farm tools) they didn't waste their money on things that would dramatically lose value.They saved a part of any money they received.  They always had money for an emergency because they didn't spend every dime they made!Clothes were made at home (this was before cheap clothing was common).  Clothes were also handed down to the next smallest kid multiple times.Their home security system was a couple of dogs.  But mostly the dogs were pets and back then no one locked their home or car doors.Fancy eating was a picnic with homemade food and family/community potlucks (also with all homemade food).The family had one TV which everyone shared and it took many years to get a color TV (bought used of course).There was no such thing as going to a gym for exercise since working in the yard/on the farm was more than enough exercise for everyone.The main way they kept the grandkids (us) occupied was to go camping (again, for the purpose of keeping the kids occupied and teaching them to hunt and fish).Entertainment was almost always at home--playing chess, playing Monopoly, playing music, cut out paper dolls, etc.I think the utilities they paid for were only the phone (a party line for years), oil for the furnace, and electricity.  They had a well, septic tank, used wood from their land for the fireplace, no cable or internet back then, and processed their own garbage so there was no charge for any of those things.Trading and bartering was a common way to get things back then.  Grandpa was an old fashioned horse trader (literally) and he bartered for lots of things instead of spending his hard-earned cash.They had one \"good outfit\" for church and funerals.  They didn't have nearly the amount of clothes and shoes that people have today and most of the clothes they had were farm work clothes.  If grandma wanted a new dress, she made it herself.They ate seasonally (no fresh tomatoes in January, only canned at that time of year) and worked seasonally (lots of farm work in the spring, summer, and fall; winter was reserved for fixing things and inside things like knitting/sewing/baking).If something broke, they fixed it.  Grandma would hop up on the (second-story!) roof to make fixes if the roof leaked.  Plumbing, electrical work, tool repair, car repair...they would fix it themselves or find a neighbor who could do the work for them (usually in trade for something the neighbor wanted).They didn't replace things until the item was dead dead.  Grandma's refrigerator from the 1940s was still going strong in the late 1980s!They didn't go to the doctor unless someone was literally on death's door.  Grandma used a lot of home remedies to fix whatever ailed the family members but she did make it a point to go to the dentist regularly for cleanings and check ups (she had all of her teeth with no cavities into her 80s).Everyone in the family from the youngest to the oldest had jobs to do.  Whether is was watching smaller kids, feeding the animals, mowing the (huge) yard, working at their U-pick stand...everyone had a purpose and responsibilities even at very young ages.They always kept more than enough on hand.  Unlike the people you see fighting over the last gallon of milk at the store before a snowstorm is set to hit, they always kept more than enough (food, water, fire wood, fuel, etc) on hand so that they didn't have to go to the store for last-minute necessities (then again, the nearest store was sometimes an hour away so shopping trips were well planned).They didn't travel like people do today.  If they had to leave the farm it was usually for an emergency (a close family member had a crisis and lived far away), and they almost always drove even if they needed to go across the country (I don't think my grandfather ever flew on a plane and grandma flew a couple of times in her late 70s to visit her brothers who lived on the other side of the country).Another main form of entertainment was visiting.  People would stop by to visit (the men would head out to the barn, the women would sit in the kitchen) and they would share gossip and news and grandma's baked good and that was considered entertainment for the day!They picked up a lot of things for free--berries from the mountains, cool rocks from the beach, ferns from the mountains, rose grafts from neighbors, plant starts and bulbs that were shared between neighbors, etc.Grandma grew all of her own flowers.  She had a beautiful rose garden, lots of bulb plants like daffodils and irises, and started her annuals from seed.All holidays were celebrated at home.  Christmas trees came from their land, Christmas tree decorations were made at home, birthdays meant a homemade cake and games for all of the neighbor kids, and Easter was a dinner made mostly from their home grown food and an egg hunt around their farm.They did without things that weren't absolutely necessary.  Then again there were not nearly as many consumer items to buy back then as there are today but they had to really need something before they would buy it.  For example they rarely bought paper towels because rags would work just as well and were cheaper.  And gloves for the kids during the winter were granddad's heavy wool socks which made pretty good mittens.They made their land work for them.  They would rent fields to other farmers if they weren't using them, had a u-pick section of their farm for years, grew grapes for local winemakers...if there was a way to make money from their land they tried it.They didn't feel the need to entertain the kids.  If the kids said they were bored, there was plenty of work to assign them so the kids usually went off on their own to play and make up adventures with local neighbor kids.Neighbors took care of each other.  If a farm animal was loose, all of the neighbors helped to coral it, all of the neighbors were armed and there was no crime in the neighborhood, if a family had an emergency the neighbors would help out watching their place while they were gone, etc.They never invested in the stock market and instead put their money into tangible things like land and tools (I think they saw what happened during the Depression and didn't want to get caught in such a crash in the future).They both liked to read a lot so they bought many books (again, used) at garage sales, thrift stores, and places you could trade in used books for other books.Gifts that they gave for birthdays and holidays were useful and practical--a sleeping bag for camping, a fishing pole, a gun (back then you could give kids guns for gifts and people didn't freak out), etc.There was a lot of social and religious pressure for everyone in the family to not mess up.  If you got arrested you shamed the entire family, ditto getting into trouble at school, stealing, etc.  Needless to say no one every end up in jail/court/needing bail/etc.During the winter everyone congregated in the living room which was heated by a fireplace.  Blankets were used to block off the open hallway leading to other rooms so as to keep all of the heat in one room.  They also used electric blankets during the winter as bedrooms in the house had no heating system.Families helped each other out.  Grandparents watched the grandkids while the parents worked, parents took care of their parents/grandparents when they got old, neighbors took care of other neighbors kids when needed, etc.They were much more concerned with privacy back then--they didn't discuss their money with others, didn't discuss their religion unless they were at church, didn't give their Social Security number to anyone, didn't talk about family matters with others, didn't \"show off\" such that you wouldn't be able to tell the millionaires from everyone else as they all lived pretty much the same (frugal) lifestyle, etc.Crafts were very common as they served as both a hobby and a way to make some extra money (by selling your work at the county fair).  Most people did some sort of craft like leather work, jewelry making, candle making, knitting, wood burning, etc.I think that because families lived so closely together (you were literally all together in one room most days in the winter) there was more of an emphasis on teaching kids manner and values and morals.  If you had to be around people all the time you at least wanted them to be reasonable socialized and civil!The work ethic was instilled early and most kids had jobs by the time they were ten or eleven--babysitting neighbor kids, doing work on other farms, bagging groceries at the local market, etc.Divorce was a rare occurrence back then.  There was a social stigma to divorce and probably economic pressure not to get divorced as well.  People learned to work out their problems instead of bailing at the first opportunity.Holiday traditions were very common and were pretty much the same every year--dyeing Easter eggs, a 4th of July picnic, Thanksgiving dinner for relatives near and far, decorating the Christmas tree...these weren't expensive traditions but were inexpensive activities that we looked forward to all year.There were several skills that were de rigueur for almost all kids at the time--learning to swim at the local swimming hole, learning to ride a bike on bicycles that had been handed down again and again, learning to shoot in the mountains, etc.People tended to volunteer a lot back then to help out their communities (as opposed to these days when some of our youngest EMT volunteers are nearing 70--young people just don't volunteer much these days.)  Men would volunteer as firefighters and EMTs, women would volunteer to help out the needy and hold holiday gift drives...this was an inexpensive way to help the community function and help those in need in the community.Obviously things weren't all puppies and roses back then.  There was a lot of poverty and a lot of social issues like domestic violence and child abuse that was considered \"normal\", but people who lived through the Great Depression showed a creativity and resilience that I hope will show up in future generations during hard times."},

If you are in debt, you are paying interest.  Paying interest is a giant waste of money since you aren't getting anything for this money but the ability to spend money you don't have!  Here's an article on seniors in debt.Getting all of the discounts that are due to you.  Whether it is a discount on your property taxes, a senior discount at your favorite restaurant, or taking a class to get a discount on your insurance, always always ask for a senior discount.Downsizing.  I know people want to keep the family home for as long as they can but if you are alone (or even a couple) and the kids have long since moved out, why pay to maintain, heat, and air condition a giant house when you can move to a smaller and thus cheaper to maintain home that fits your current lifestyle?Changing their lifestyle to match their income.  When you retire, you don't need to keep up with your pre-retirement lifestyle.  You don't need the \"right\" car, the professional wardrobe, the lunches out everyday, and everything else that goes along with a professional lifestyle and professional income.  Reviewing every dollar that leaves your account and determine if there is a free/cheaper way to get the same thing/item/service for less.  Every once in a while you will hear of seniors who still pay a monthly fee to rent their home phone--which they have been paying for decades!  The same goes for computer modems which are much cheaper to buy rather than rent, there may be subscriptions you still pay for but never use, etc.Cooking for an army.  It took us a while to ratchet back the amount of food we bought and the amount of food we cooked, after the kids moved out.  While we easily have a few months of food on hand (great for an emergency!), there is no point in buying food for the freezer which will succumb to freezer burn before it ever get eaten, or buying those giant containers of food at Costco which you will never eat.Loaning money or co signing for a loan for anyone--even your favorite grandkid!  By living frugally you can retire, by apparently living the life of leisure as a retiree, you may look like you have a lot of money!  Don't loan money you don't have to give as a gift and NEVER EVER co-sign for a loan for anyone.Spending too much--on car repairs, on home repairs, on home security systems, etc.  Seniors often get taken advantage of in these areas so if you need a repair done, your computer fixed, or another service, always ask friends for referrals, check reviews, check references, and make sure they are even a licensed and insured business to start with (it took my friend three months to get a shady contractor to finish a job at her house, she tracked him down at his church and asked his pastor for help getting the guy to finish the work he had been paid for!).Edit:  I just saw this article and while I knew defrauding the elderly wasn't exactly uncommon, I didn't know that defrauding the elderly was a $37 billion a year business!!!"},

Many. Scam. Phone calls.  Like four or five a day each.  We pretty much never answer our phones unless we know who is calling these days.I am an avid genealogist but even though DNA tests are super inexpensive these days and are being advertised relentlessly during the holidays I have still refrained from getting one.  I mean social media and credit companies can't even protect our personal information so I have very little confidence that such tests won't be hijacked somehow in the the future.  And for these reasons too.Finally, I am missing Romaine lettuce.  We usually have salad everyday and while we have been using red leaf lettuce it isn't quite the same (and I am really hungering for a nice big Caesar salad!)."},

{"title": "10 Things I'm Going to Do to Be Happier", "date": "Friday, November 9, 2018", "text": "After my mini rant yesterday, I figured the only one who can change my situation is me.  So in an effort to be happier, I decided I should do the following things...I came across this self improvement list and figure I would read through it and try to implement some of the suggested tips.I'm going to cut WAY back on the news.  I'm kind of a news junkie but ingesting bad news 24/7 can't be good for me.  So I will skip the morning and afternoon news (and most online news) and just catch the evening local and national news.  That should be enough news to catch the headlines but not be hammered over and over with negative news.I really need to cut back on caffeine.  It makes me jittery (and fat since my caffeine comes with a healthy dollop of ice cream/cream/milk).I need to walk every single day.  I get lazy and have skipped walking a lot lately but our weather is perfect for walking and the endorphins are a nice bonus.I need to create more and consume less.  I feel better creating (writing, website design) than I do consuming (watching YouTube, redditing, etc).I need to connect more with people.  I generally find people tiring but I need to put more effort into connecting with people in small ways (like sending birthday cards or making positive comments on people's FB pages).I need to volunteer.  Before we moved to Vegas I was volunteering all over the place.  Since we have moved here I haven't volunteered much but I really do like helping people and it is a good way to take the focus off of all of the negative things that are happening and focus on the positives of making a difference in people's lives.I need to read Daily Word everyday.  This is a religious website that isn't heavy-handed religion.  Rather it is always has positive messages and is a good way to start the day.I need to improve my diet.  I waver between WFPB vegan and falling off the (health) wagon way too often.  I need to go vegan and STICK WITH IT!I need to get more into my hobbies.  Again, I get kind of lazy and don't go out and do but there are so many amazing opportunities to focus on hobbies here (we have a wonderful genealogy library, there are tech meet ups, there are hiking groups) and again, this is another way to focus on doing fun things instead of focusing on negative news."},

{"title": "On Becoming an Old Woman", "date": "Thursday, October 11, 2018", "text": "I'm not old yet--although I am heading in that direction at a rapid clip!--but lately I have been seeing more and more issues with growing old, especially for women.  Most of these issues are financial in nature (being menopausal is a whole other issue...don't even get me started on that) and seem to disproportionately impact women more so than men.  Here are some things that need to be addressed, individually I guess since we can't even get the country to agree that things like universal healthcare are pretty important, and the earlier the better...Getting divorced in your later years.  I've known a few women to get divorced in their late 50s to 60s.  These women worked little, if ever, and judges these days are more likely to award a limited amount of alimony instead of alimony for life.  When the alimony stops these women are left high and dry and after having little to no work experience, hopping into the job market at a late age is difficult if not impossible.Which leads me to women working in their 50s and 60s.  The job market/employment sector has changed drastically since I was in high school/college.  Lifetime employment is rare if it is even a thing anymore.  Middle management jobs are vanishing.  Switching jobs is like jumping off a diving board then realizing there isn't any water in the pool (in other words, you might be rocking your long-term job then a downsizing/layoff comes along and there are literally no jobs that will hire you because you are too old, too expensive, and too out of the new tech loop).Healthcare is a whole other issue.  If you relied on your job/your husband's job to pay for your health insurance and then something happens (you get laid off, you get divorced, your spouse dies) you can be left with no health insurance.  You can't even go to the emergency room these days with a basic UTI without being billed for many thousands of dollars.  And even if you have health insurance it sometimes doesn't cover prescription medications and it may have really big co-pays.  Yikes.Housing is another issue.  Housing costs--both apartment rental and buying a home--is both expensive in a tight housing market and sometimes unattainable if, as mentioned above, you are unemployed/under employed.  There is no real safety net for women--especially older single or divorced women--when it comes to housing.  And if you do manage to keep your home, as you age and live on a low or fixed income, it becomes harder and harder to maintain your home when it comes to repairs and even regular maintenance.Living on a low or fixed income becomes harder and harder over the years.  This is because your income stays the same or increases in teeny tiny increments while costs--everything from gas to food to utilities--continue to increase.So for now I will continue to worry about these issues and look for fixes.  I have two friends who are older single women and are recently unemployed without many job skills and one friend teetering on the edge of unemployment who could go from a $120k year job to no job that she could get that would even approach that pay level.  All of them have houses to pay for and regular expenses to cover yet no outside support.  It is a really scary situation!"},

{"title": "10 Holiday Hacks for Saving Money", "date": "Monday, October 8, 2018", "text": "With several holidays coming up in the next few months, here are a bunch of ways to save money on the most common things we do during the holidays:Meals.  Whether it's Thanksgiving dinner or Christmas morning breakfast, make family get-togethers potlucks where everyone brings a dish or another part of the meal (drinks, plates and napkins, etc).  This way the financial burden of hosting such a meal is spread evenly instead of falling on just the host.Decorations.  Dollar Tree decorations are just as festival as expensive decorations from a department store.  If you are particularly crafty you can make your own decorations for an additional \"wow\" factor.Gifts.  Gifts can either be unique and inexpensive (giving people experiences over material items) or crazy expensive (new car anyone?).  Most people fall somewhere in between when it comes to holiday gifts so one of the best ways to procure a lot of gifts with a little money is to start shopping early--like late summer--and buy things as they go on sale over the months prior to Christmas.  Also, limiting the number of gifts each person gets and in big families, choosing names so that each person only buys a gift for one or two other people instead of all family members, is a great way to share the holiday spirit without going bankrupt.The centerpiece.  If you are looking for pumpkins to carve, turkeys for dinner, or a big, beautiful Christmas tree, look towards cheap DIY (grow it yourself!), a bit more expensive method of letting someone else DIY (pick your own pumpkin at a local farm or cut your own tree with an inexpensive DNR permit), and big sales (pumpkins and turkeys are often loss leaders at the local grocery store during the holidays).Gift wrapping.  Again, cheap gift wrapping is where the Dollar Store shines.  The wrapping will literally be thrown in the garbage as soon as it is removed so why spend a lot of money on this when you can buy reams of wrap for a dollar?Desserts.  Baking supplies like flour, sugar, canned pumpkin, etc. are often on sale this time of year and baking things yourself is actually super easy (and super inexpensive compared to buying desserts at a bakery).Halloween trick or treating.  It seems like the number of kids going door-to-door to trick or treat has really dwindled over the years.  These days many places in town host \"trunk or treat\" events which is both less expensive (you can donate a bag of candy to someone's \"trunk\" or table, instead of having to buy a dozen or more bags of candy to give away from your home) and safer than having kids wandering around in the dark.Thanksgiving Black Friday shopping.  Black Friday (or these days Black Thursday evening right after Thanksgiving dinner) is hyped to make you spend more money.  Don't shop if you don't need things, look at the sale items and determine if they are really good deals (the specs on electronics, for example, are often not as good as the regular item as they are made especially for Black Friday), or you can simply #OptOutside.Christmas traditions.  I think traditions are more memorable than a pile of gifts that will soon be forgotten.  Families that develop annual traditions around the holidays can do this on the cheap like watching \"It's a Wonderful Life\" complete with popcorn (hubby and I watch a sappy Christmas romance movie on Netflix each evening starting a couple weeks before Christmas) or singing Christmas carols, etc., and have a very memorable, fun time with a minimum of money spent.Giving back.  The holidays are a good reminder to give back to those in need.  Whether you donate your time and volunteer at a soup kitchen, dress up like Santa to entertain the kids, knit scarves to give to the homeless (thrift stores have lots and lots of cheap yarn!), there are several ways you can give back with very little expense."},

{"title": "10 Debt Traps", "date": "Wednesday, September 26, 2018", "text": "I came across this article today about 10 Unexpected Debt Traps, and figured I would add ten more common debt traps that people still seem to fall for:Co signing for anyone for anything.  If you do this things might go along swimmingly for quite a while.  Until they don't.  And then that loan you cosigned for ages ago falls on you to pay off when the person you co-signed for decides that they either can't or won't finish paying off the debt.Buying when you can rent.  Jet skis, RVs, boats...if it isn't something you use ALL. THE. TIME. then it is probably better to rent the thing when you need it instead of buying it and paying all the fees that go along with ownership.Renting when you can buy.  Buying real estate can make some people squeamish but I have always been a fan of buying a place to live instead of renting.  There are many costs associated with home ownership but it seems like the ever-increasing costs of rent is more of an expense than owning.  Unless you won't be in a location for very long, it often pays to buy a place to live than rent (but obviously not at the top of the market!).Being \"unbanked\".  People who can't or don't want to have a bank account usually end up paying way more in fees than people with bank accounts.  I have accounts at three different banks (one bank and two credit unions) and pay no fees at all for any of my accounts.Payday lenders and car title lenders.  These places are huge rip offs when you look at the terms of the loans the provide.  400% APR anyone?  Sheesh.Emotional spending.  I think we all do this at one time or another--cast common sense to the wind and just buy buy buy.  But people who do this all the time usually end up in a great deal of never-ending debt.Playing roulette with your insurance situation.  I know some people who skipped car insurance for a few months to save money and almost invariably that is when they got in at-fault car wrecks.  Ditto skipping health insurance, life insurance, homeowners or renters insurance, etc.Student loan debt.  There are a lot of people who don't much like school to start with but feel like they have to go to college at all costs.  Then they end up with a mountain of student loans for a degree they can't even really use.  If a kid is brilliant school-wise they should definitely go to college to get a useful degree but if they are kind of meh about school, technical certificates and trade apprenticeships can be much more interesting and much less costly.Consolidating debt.  This is kind of a double-edged sword.  If you can consolidate all of your debt to a really low interest loan and pay the loan off ASAP, that's probably a good thing.  More often, however, people consolidate their debt then proceed to run up their high-interest credit cards again which just puts them in even more debt!Not planning for the future.  Whether it is putting an emergency fund together, planning financially for your retirement, deciding on what you would do if you needed extended care, etc., if you start doing these things when you are 60 and/or in a major crisis, you will be screwed.  People need to start planning--and saving/investing--for their old age sooner rather than later."},

{"title": "Where You Retire Greatly Impacts Your Retirement!", "date": "Friday, September 7, 2018", "text": "A popular topic on retirement boards is where to retire to in order to get the most bang for your buck.  Occasionally a random person will ask \"how do I retire well in (one of the most expensive cities in the nation)?\"  In that case, you don't.  Not really anyway.  Somewhere between people wanting to retire in Palo Alto and those who can only afford to retire in some remote ultra cheap place is the rest of us who want to balance a nice retirement with stretching our limited income as far as it will go.  Here are some things to consider when you are picking a retirement location:The cost and type of housing.  We have always bought houses both for the investment potential but also because when you rent there is no cap on how high rent can go (unless you are in a rent-controlled property which is a whole other discussion).  Some people want to live in senior-only communities and some people need subsidized senior housing or assisted living facilities nearby...it kind of depends on your own personal circumstances.Cost of maintaining your house.  This gets more expensive and more difficult as we age because it is often harder physically to do the work yourself plus the things that break can be very expensive (like replacing the heating or AC system...eeekkk).  A smaller house and property is generally cheaper to maintain than a larger house and property.Location of your house.  Some areas of the country have sky-high housing costs and some have dirt cheap housing costs.  We were fortunate to buy at the bottom of the market here in Las Vegas.  If we wanted to buy here now the cost of our home would have been more than double what we paid!  Property tax (house).  The difference between the property tax on our house in Las Vegas (a state with low property tax) and a similar house in New England (a very high property tax area) is about $8000 per year.  Needless to say, if you live on a fixed income this has a significant impact on your budget.  A note on property tax, some places have rebates or caps on property tax for various groups of people (seniors, veterans, disabled, etc.) which can help out a bit when it comes to paying property tax).Car ownership costs.  Some places have cheap car registration and cheap car insurance.  In Las Vegas we have expensive car registration and expensive car insurance.  Our public transit system here isn't that great either otherwise we would just ditch the cars and take public transit and save a boatload of money.  Ideally I would love to live in an area where I didn't need a car at all!Other taxes.  Some other tax-related things to consider when deciding where to live is all of the other taxes that will be imposed on you.  State income tax (some states tax pensions and social security, some don't), sales tax (can range from high to non-existent), and estate taxes can also impact you, depending on the state.Other insurance.  I mentioned car insurance above but where you live can impact the cost of all other types of insurance as well: life insurance, property insurance, health insurance, long-term care insurance...actuaries live by their tables and part of their tables are location-based formulas.Weather.  There is a reason seniors flock to the south for both vacations and retirement--the great weather!  No shoveling snow!  No ice to slip on and break a hip!  I love having four seasons but I have to admit that never needing cold weather clothes again/no shoveling snow/no being rained on for days at a time is a nice part of retiring to the desert southwest.Cost of utilities.  In some areas of the country, people pay a ridiculously high amount of money for utilities (again, I'm looking at your New England).  I still can't figure out why my water bill is so low here in the desert yet it was so high in Seattle where there is water everywhere.  If you have a house with a well and septic, of course your utilities will cost less but repair costs could be more if either of these break.Crime.  The older people get, the more vulnerable they get so crime becomes a bigger concern as we age.  Unfortunately Vegas is a hot bed of crime of all kinds (one of the main reasons I want out of here).  Taking precautions goes a long way towards preventing opportunistic crime but random crime can still be quite unsettling.Proximity to family/friends or a major airport.  There are so many retirees here in Vegas that they kind of form their own families.  We watch out for our retiree friends, help out when we can, and check on people who have been \"missing\" for a while.  It is great to have family near by but many retirees here settle for having a major airport nearby which can bring in family on a regular basis.Free or cheap entertainment.  When you are retired you have A LOT of hours to fill each day.  We are lucky to have so many free and cheap entertainment options here.  Other friends have retired to rural areas and are perfectly happy with their gardening, animals, and other hobbies which keep them busy.  On a side note, some areas are flush with senior discounts and some aren't.  We love that there are so many places that offer senior discounts on everything from movies and restaurants to grocery stores and other entertainment here.Cost and availability of medical care.  When you get old you also become more reliant on medical care.  It becomes pretty important to have medical services close by as well as medical insurance that covers your needs.  While Medicare takes care of much of your medical costs, elderly people can get slammed with high prescription as well as gap coverage costs.  Some states offer more in the way of healthcare (access, quality of care, comprehensiveness of care, expanded insurance coverage) than others.The cost and availability of food is also important.  Some places have cheap food all over the place (Las Vegas is a good example of this) whereas in other places, nutritious food is both expensive and hard to find (I know some towns that are a good hour and a half drive from a grocery store!).Availability of jobs is a minor concern for most retirees but it is nice to have the opportunity to work if you want it and some towns just don't have jobs of any kind, for anyone.Availability of needed services is also something to consider.  A good veterinarian is a requirement for some people so towns without this service would be off their list quickly, pharmacies, coffee shops...some people want specific services available nearby so this is something to consider.Natural disasters are a thing nearly everywhere in our country but choosing the kinds of natural disasters you are willing to put up with may fall on your list of things to consider before you move.  Massive winter storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes are on our \"don't like\" list.  Earthquakes and high heat don't both us as much.I never thought that the education of a population would be important but when you move from a highly educated area to an area with the worst school district in the nation (Las Vegas) the shortcomings of having a dumb population are legion.  Voting rates are dismal, crime is high, parents don't care about their kid's education...and just don't care about their kids in general (we have really high youth homeless rates here; two little kids were murdered by their parents just last week in two separate incidents...ayayay).  When you live in a highly educated area people are going places, when you live in a poorly educated area people are going nowhere and it is sad and it impacts the entire community.Other things.  Specific on our list of important things to consider are things that impact us personally.  We like living near a military base for all of the services it offers retirees, I like good gun laws since I own guns, I also like lots of outdoor recreation opportunities which some people require and some could care less about.The decision of where to retire is really important when it comes to your quality (and sometimes even quantity!) of life!"},

{"title": "10 Alternatives to College Loans", "date": "Tuesday, September 4, 2018", "text": "I came across this short piece today which pointed out that 30% of student loan borrowers can't keep up with their loans.  Wow.  I mean it is no secret that there are plenty of people with college degrees that are still working at Starbucks or other entry level jobs, and it is also no secret that pay, even with a degree, is hardly increasing at all but I just feel sorry for people who are barely in their 20s yet have tens of thousands of dollars in student loan bills hanging over their head (which is where it will stay as there is usually no way to discharge this type of debt).  Here are ten alternatives to getting student loans:Apply for scholarships like a madman(woman).  I helped a girl do this all through her high school years.  She would apply for every conceivable scholarship she could find (I think she spent every weekend doing this) then had me proofread her applications every Monday.  She graduated last spring with a pharmacology degree and zero debt.Join the military.  No, not everyone who joins the military sees combat (most don't), and yes there are a lot of negatives to joining the military (also a lot of positives) but the GI Bill is still a great way to pay for college.Attend a college which offers free tuition!  Don't forget to check your local state colleges, some of which offer free tuition to local residents.Get into the Running Start or similar program during high school.  This program allows high school students to take classes at local community colleges during high school free of charge so when they graduate high school, they also have two years of college credits which they paid nothing for.Take CLEP/DSST/ECE tests to skip over college work that you know and earn college credits for cheap.Find alternative ways to learn job skills instead of getting a college degree.  This is common is IT/tech jobs, entrepreneurial jobs, and even lawyers have an opportunity to do this.Check out apprenticeship programs.  These job training programs teach you valuable job skills and you get paid for doing this!  I knew a guy who couldn't afford college so he became an apprentice in the construction industry.  After he got his journeyman card he worked (high paying) construction jobs during the day and went to college at night and earned an engineering degree.Work at a job that offers tuition reimbursement to help you pay for college.  You still have to pay for some of your education but by starting at a community college and having your job help pay your tuition you will be able to earn a college degree on the cheap this way.  Working at some colleges can also garner you free tuition.Decide if you can have the career you want without a college degree.  I wanted to be a social worker but the degree was expensive yet the pay was minimal so I started a non profit and got to do all of the client assistance/social work I could handle.  I also thought about being in the medical field but pre-med chemistry nearly killed me so I started a business where I did a lot of writing for the medical field; no degree required.  I've known marketers who do marketing without a degree simply because they had the track record of doing big marketing campaigns successfully.Finally there are some weird ways to college including this, this, and this."},

{"title": "10 Tips for Going Vegan", "date": "Sunday, September 2, 2018", "text": "I've been 100% WFPB vegan for more than a week!  I feel great (I haven't needed a mid day nap for five days!  I did a 10k yesterday with no practice and could have done another 10k right afterwards!) and it has also cut our grocery bill a bit too.  So while I am in no way an expert at this vegan stuff, here are several things I have learned:I think it is better to switch over to a WFPB diet a bit more gradually than I did (I went 100% vegan one day which my intestines are still unhappy about).  This way you can transition slowly (maybe go all vegan with breakfast for a week then the next week vegan breakfast and lunch, then the third week go fully vegan).Get rid of all unhealthy breakfast food first (toss fake syrup, opened breakfast cereal, etc).  For unopened stuff you can always donate it to a food pantry or someone you know who would eat it.  Replace all of your unhealthy breakfast food with whole, healthy foods (fruit, steel cut oats, almond milk, etc).  The next week do the same for lunch, the third week do the same for dinner.  Don't buy any unhealthy food!  Keeping unhealthy snacks on hand \"just in case\" defeats the purpose.  With switching over gradually you can eat some of the lunch and dinner stuff you have before getting rid of the leftovers, but from the beginning you don't want to buy any more unhealthy food to add to your pantry even though you are still lax on lunch and dinner.Make an effort to try a new vegan recipe every day.  There is a steep learning curve for making vegan food for most people (how do you cook without milk and eggs and white flour???).  Unfortunately even well reviewed vegan recipes can be pretty awful so you have to try a lot of recipes to find the stuff you like.Try to stick to as much natural food as possible.  There are a lot of vegan foods out there that are full of oil and salt and sugar which aren't really healthy despite the word 'vegan' on it.  Fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, lentils, oats, beans, spices...stuff that looks just like it did when it came off the tree/bush/plant is the best food.  Plus highly processed vegan foods are usually really expensive.Shop everywhere for food.  You don't have to do all of your shopping at Whole Foods!  We get a lot of food from the 99 cent store (produce, bags of beans, and legumes), a lot of food from ethnic stores (all sorts of produce and whole grains, nuts, seeds, spices), some stuff from Costco (a big bag of chia seeds, good bread, good almond butter, etc).  Ideally you would grow some of your own food and forage for wild edibles as well!Stay psyched for this change by watching videos on Netflix ('Forks Over Knives', 'What the Health', 'Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead') as well as on YouTube (stuff by Dr Gregor, Dr Fuhrman, etc).  These shows are both informational and inspirational.Try to find new foods that you like from a lot of different cultures--Indian is my favorite but many ethnic cuisines focus heavily on vegan stuff (warning: it may take your taste buds a bit of time to catch up with your new diet!).  Hubby tried vegan hamburgers and vegan hot dogs because he wanted the taste of meat.  He found that there really isn't the taste of meat in things that aren't, well, meat, so changing to new and different healthy foods is a good idea.Cook in bulk.  Cooking real food takes a lot longer than popping junk food in the microwave.  Soups/stews/hummus/salad with a dozen things in it, all of these things take a while to prep, and cook in the case of soups and stews, but these items are also great for bulk cooking so that you don't have to actually cook every day.  I make a huge salad that lasts for three days, I freeze leftover soups and stews, I make a big batch of hummus and use it on everything (as a sandwich spread, as a dip, on baked potatoes, etc).I think mindset is the most important part of this.  With everything I eat, I tell myself it is for the health and betterment of my body.  Instead of feeling deprived (I'll drink a healthy smoothie but I really want a Starbucks frappuccino), I look at the way I will look and feel (healthy=slimmer, more energetic, clearer thinking, unhealthy=headaches, need a nap, sluggish in mind and body)."},
{"title": "A Fun Saturday Morning", "date": "Saturday, September 1, 2018", "text": "Finally!  This morning our walking group went on our first group walk of the season.  It was a nice 95 degrees when we got done (even with heading out at 8am) but it was a dry heat and an improvement over the summer's 110 degree temps!  We walked the north part of the Las Vegas Strip and most of the walk was done before the tourists came out so we were able to make pretty good time.  Overall a great way to start the weekend!If you are interested in finding a walking group near you, check out the AVA (volksmarch) organization which hosts all kinds of walks around the US.  For non-members the organized group walks are free, for members, the walks cost $3 which both supports the club and goes towards little awards you earn based on the mileage you do and the number of walks you do (one guy I know has walked 40,000 kilometers with the group over the year!)."},

{"title": "10 Financial Checks", "date": "Sunday, August 19, 2018", "text": "Here are 10 things that everyone should check regularly to ensure their financial well being:Pull your free annual credit report and make sure all of the info is correct.Ensure your insurance coverages (like, health, auto, home, long term care) meet your current needs.For bills where you have options for providers (not water because most places only have one water service provider, for this I mean things like internet, insurance, etc. where you can shop around for the best deal) call around to the competition at least once a year to make sure you are getting the best deal.Make sure you are getting the best banking deal (often credit unions are better because they charge no fee for their services).If you do use credit cards, make sure you are getting the best deal as far at interest rates/terms go.Check to see if you are getting the best deal on your mortgage.  I never recommend refinancing your home to pull money out (you want to pay it off ASAP!) but if interest rates drop or you want to switch your term from 30 to 15 years, refinancing may make financial sense.Review your utility bills and see if there is anything you can do to reduce these.  Many utility companies offer things like free devices (low flow shower heads, etc), free home energy audits, and rebates for high efficiency appliances to help you save money.  This along with conservation efforts can go a long way towards reducing your utility bills.Check your monthly bank/credit card statements for any sort of money drains that you need to fix.  You may want to cancel things such as auto-pay for a gym membership you never use or subscription services billed automatically to your credit card that you rarely use.Get rid of any big financial problems hanging over your head if possible.  People often pay to get rid of their time shares, for example.  They may encourage someone to refi a loan to get them off the loan as a cosigner if they had previously co-signed for someone.  One guy I know worked 90 hours a week for a few months to get rid of a debt that had been teetering on the edge of collections.Revisit your financial situation to make sure you are on track including your budget, your investments, your retirement accounts, your net worth, etc."},

{"title": "Are You Ready for the Next Recession?", "date": "Sunday, July 29, 2018", "text": "There are a lot of websites that are predicting a coming recession.  Apparently it isn't \"if\" but \"when\" the economy will tank again (economics are cyclical so that makes sense).  I'll add to this summary of how you should be prepared for the inevitable financial shake up:Savings.  Of course everyone should have savings.  An emergency fund should be the minimum that you have so that you can cover three to six (even better, nine to 12) months of living expenses.  During the last economic downturn, people were out of work for a year or more so being able to pay bills out of savings is way better than maxing out your credit cards--at maximum interest rates--just to survive.Investments.  Dave Ramsey always recommends mutual funds which makes sense; this way if one stock tanks, others may not do so poorly.  Also when the recession turns around, your entire fund will probably come back up as it did after the last economic downturn.  On the other hand, investing a lot of money in one stock or day trading or trying to \"time the market\" usually has very poor outcomes.Debt.  Pay of your debt ASAP!!!  This includes the house and the car and the student loans and the credit cards.  Listen to Dave Ramsey until your ears bleed if necessary but pay off everything.  In the event of a bad recession, if you have no debt, you will be able to survive much longer on your emergency fund than if you have a mountain of bills to pay each month.Be employable.  I would also say learn how to hustle and also have multiple streams of income as this is the best way to float through turbulent economic times.  If you put all of your (employment) eggs in one basket and that industry tanks, you will be in deep trouble."},

{"title": "Don't Fall for Scams!", "date": "Thursday, July 26, 2018", "text": "I don't know what the deal is but lately we (mostly hubby) has been inundated with scam phone calls.  He doesn't answer his phone anymore unless he knows who is calling him, any unknown call he lets go to voicemail.  On his voice mail today, one call telling him his computer has been hijacked (seriously???) and that his computer will be locked and he will no longer be able to access it until he calls the number they left (I'm sure they would then ask for immediate payment if he were to call back).  The second call was from the \"IRS\" and it said he owes back taxes and will be arrested within the hour unless he calls and pays them via Western Union.  He gets these kinds of calls on a daily basis and his sisters (also over 65 years old) say the same thing happens to them all the time.Among other recent scams, someone called me and said there was a pending court case against me and if I didn't pay a fine immediately I would be arrested that evening.  I told the woman I would be at the courthouse in the morning so if she told me the court and docket number I would be happy to fix the problem then.  She got mad and slammed the phone down in my ear.  Then I was talking to my sister in law and she told me she just paid the annual $400 bill for her website.  When I asked what bill because I build and host both her and her husband's business websites she said she gets a bill each year for it which she pays.  I told her it was a scam and never pay anything for her website again (needless to say she was pretty upset she had been paying any bill was sent to her).  It's a very common scam.  The scammers figure that many businesses will just pay any bill they receive without a second thought which, unfortunately, many businesses do.It used to be that many of these scams would come to people through their email but I guess that wasn't lucrative enough (plus spam blockers work pretty well) so now the focus seems to be on phone calls (the do not call list seems to be useless).  Anyway, this is just a reminder to not fall for emails/snail mails/phone calls from anyone demanding money.  Ask what agency they are calling from then hang up and look up the agency's phone number--don't use the phone number the caller gives you--and call the agency yourself if you are concerned.  Similarly you can often Google the number they call you from/leave for you to call back and will probably find many people have already reported the number as a scam.Here's just a short list of the many scams to watch out for."},

{"title": "It's Back to School Time Already!", "date": "Sunday, July 22, 2018", "text": "I was at the store today and there were kids everywhere!  I asked one mom and she said that school here resumes August 13th which seems super early to me but we haven't had kids in school for ages so maybe that is the usual time for kids to go back to school now?  When I was in school we didn't start the school year until mid September!  Anyway, here are some money-saving tips for back to school:Shop the sales.  Walmart and every office supply store in town currently has super cheap school supplies so now is a great time to stock up (buy enough for the whole school year then hold half back until after winter break when the kids will need/appreciate a bunch of new school supplies).Check out your school district's website.  It has info on everything from registration to school supply lists to bus routes to program options, etc.Shop for school clothes/shoes starting with the Goodwill then Ross/TJ Maxx/Walmart then hit the higher end mall stores.  Hopefully by the time you get to the expensive stores most of their needs will have been met at the cheaper stores!Determine how you will do lunch.  If you qualify, you can sign your kids up for free/reduced lunches.  Packing lunch from home seems like a healthier but more expensive/more work option.Determine how your kids will get to school.  I am mystified that many parents drive their kids to school these days.  When we were kids--even when our kids were kids--the options for getting to school were walk, ride a bike or ride the school bus--parent's simply did not drive their kids to school ever.  Maybe consider car pooling to save money if several kids in the neighborhood need to be driven to school?Determine what you will do for before and after school care.  Our school district has a before and after school care program which seems like an interesting option (and possibly cheaper than daycare/babysitters).For parents who need help, see if your school district has back to school fairs planned where they offer free school supplies, free immunizations, even free haircuts for the kids."},

{"title": "Travel Insurance", "date": "Friday, July 20, 2018", "text": "Well the part of the family that went to Europe is coming back earlier than expected (not sure why, just saw it on Facebook) and a few of hubby's sisters will be heading to Asia week after next (when asked if he wanted to go, hubby said definitively \"no way\").  I think hubby is worried about traveling because if we would have not decided to do a no-travel year, he would have been in a remote part of the Philippines when he had his heart attack earlier this year.  I think the possibility of what would have happened to him in that case has kind of curbed his interest in travel :(I am a bit worried about the hubby's sisters traveling because all of them have a hard time walking and they are all getting older and you never know when a sudden medical crisis will happen.  I told them all to check out travel insurance \"just in case\".  These are the kinds of insurance to consider if you will be traveling:Medical insurance.  See if your current medical insurance will cover you, whereever you go.  Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't, and sometimes if you end up in a hospital in a foreign country they will hold you hostage until you pay them cash before letting you leave.  You can get a specific travel medical insurance plan if your regular medical insurance doesn't cover you abroad.Trip cancellation insurance.  There is an added fee when you book a cruise (as well as other types of travel) that will pay for trip cancellation insurance in case you can't make your travel due to illness/death/etc.  Note that some policies have very specific rules while others let you cancel for any reason.Medical evacuation insurance.  If you become seriously injured or ill in a foreign country, you can't just hop on a plane and come back home which is where medical evacuation insurance comes into play (if you were to pay cash to be medically evacuated and returned home it could cost $100k+!!).Kidnap and ransom insurance.  There is actually an entire industry built around people being kidnapped and ransomed while traveling abroad (eeekkk!).  Other types of travel-related insurance.  There are several other types of insurance coverages for travelers, either through specific policies or sometimes through your credit card, including lost luggage, rental car coverage, term life insurance, medical tourism coverage, etc."},

{"title": "A Suggestion for Giving Back", "date": "Tuesday, July 17, 2018", "text": "This summer I ended up working with several teachers who were on their summer break and earning a bit of extra money by working at the WSOP.  These folks were wonderful to work with and I learned A LOT about teaching/schools/students/etc. One of the most eye-opening things I learned was how important copy paper is for teachers.  I already knew that teachers spent a lot of their own money on stuff for their classrooms and stuff for their students, especially in the poorer schools in our city, but I didn't realize that in some schools teachers were given ONE CASE of copy paper and it needed to last them the entire school year (!!).Just this past week I've seen all kinds of school supplies starting to go on sale at Walmart, Office Depot, Staples, etc, and according to the teachers I worked with, ALL of these school items--as well as cases of copy paper--would be hugely appreciated by teachers, especially in Title 1 schools where parents can't even afford pencils for their kids.So if you are in the mood to give, consider taking advantage of all of the great school supply sales then donating these items to the poorer schools in your area.  Here's an example of the school supplies needed by elementary and junior high school kids.  Many school districts also welcome other sorts of donations for needy and homeless students ranging from pre-packaged foods to fill \"weekend backpacks\" for hungry kids, clothes/shoes/hygiene supplies for homeless kids, prom dresses for \"prom closets\" for girls who can't afford to buy dresses for proms, etc."},

{"title": "How Do You Afford Your Lifestyle??", "date": "Sunday, July 15, 2018", "text": "We have been asked that question numerous times because although hubby is retirement age, I am a couple of decades away from traditional retirement age.  So when people see me and hubby always together they often wonder why I don't work and, more importantly, how we can both be retired.I came across this video today from a guy who, with is wife, spends nearly all of his time hiking long trails.  Since they are both young, everyone wants to know how they can afford such a lifestyle when \"normal\" people work full time jobs for several decades before they can retire.It comes down to lifestyle choices.  If we wanted to keep our previous lifestyle of a big house in a high cost of living area with two brand new cars in the driveway, a dozen maxed out credit cards, shopping at the mall daily, weekly mani/pedis, and buying everything we see just to keep up with our friends and co-workers, well, we would both be working until we die.Nearly a decade ago, however, we found Dave Ramsey and decided to totally change our lifestyle and everything that went along with it.  We got out of debt, moved to a low cost of living area, bought a practically new house at nearly the bottom of the housing market at a cost of around one third of what we were pre-approved for through our mortgage company, shared one paid off car, stopped shopping anywhere but at the Goodwill, and basically gave up \"keeping up with the Joneses\".We also had several things working in our favor, namely hubby's pension which saw us through the early years of our lifestyle change then later hubby's social security.  We are both covered by free (hubby) and super low cost (me) military health insurance.  We don't pay retail for anything.  We have been debt free except for the house and recently my one credit card which I am working diligently to pay off.  I decided to buy a new car because our old car was nearing twenty years old (and I figured it made more sense to buy one while I was still able to work if need be to pay it off) for which we got at a great price for a highly rated car that should last (hopefully) for a couple more decades. I have been fortunate to have had several sources of extra income throughout the last decade which has helped to buy nice extras (and is currently paying off the car) but much of our lifestyle has come down to making significant lifestyle changes and buying as little as possible.  When we do buy things we wait until the price of said item is highly discounted and then we pay cash for it.So that's our story and living within (or well below) your means is a common thread for a lot of people who have embraced a frugal lifestyle from Amy Daczyczn to the Cash Cow Couple to several other people."},

I'm like 20 years older than you and a hundred years smarter...go away.  It's a common thing in Las Vegas.A former NBA player was arrested for cheating in a casino today.  I've seen how efficient and effective high-level casino security is and it is pretty amazing to see them work.Some guy in downtown Las Vegas tried to attack people with a pickax this morning.  Homeless people here are five kinds of crazy.Our casinos are being taken over by robots.Some guy launched himself off a high floor of a casino and landed in their pool to commit suicide a couple days ago.  The weird part about this is that suicides rarely ever make the news in Las Vegas (it's a known thing that negative news is covered up here).I wrote to the Ellen Show today to see if she could help the lady I told you about a few days ago pay her medical debt (also so she doesn't have to work 90 hours a week while fighting cancer!).  It's probably a million to one odds of being chosen but it's worth a try!  Tonight I am looking forward to \"Little Big Shots\" on TV.  It's a fun, happy, non political show with amazing little kids (just the kind of happiness we all need more of!)."},

{"title": "10 Things I No Longer Need", "date": "Friday, July 6, 2018", "text": "I've probably made every financial mistake in the book.  Fortunately experience (and age) have cured me from \"absolutely needing\" many things that were considered \"absolutely necessary\" when I was younger.  Among those things...A fancy sports car which I could (barely) afford to lease.  Now I need a good, solid car which should last for years and years and most importantly, which I can afford to pay off within a few years.An expensive name-brand purse.  Someone should have smacked me years ago when I bought dozens of Coach, Dooney & Bourke, and Louis Vuitton purses.  What a God-awful waste of money!Brand new clothes from the mall.  Now I find much much cheaper (and often much cooler, more unique, and much better overall) clothes at the Goodwill.Mani/pedis every other week.  Again, a frightening waste of money.  It's much cheaper (and often healthier) to just neatly trim and buff your nails at home.  Even splurging on a bottle of OPI polish is a big money saver over visiting a salon every couple weeks.  Note, I often find OPI polish for a few dollars at TJ Maxx.Buying birthday and Christmas presents for our extended family.  When our immediate family ballooned to nearly 100 people it because ridiculously expensive to buy and send gifts to every sibling/sibling's kids/sibling's grand kids/aunt/uncle/etc. for birthdays and Christmases.  Needless to say, gifts now are smaller, more practical, and limited to our kids and grandkids.Cable TV with every station known to man.  We have very basic cable TV right now because it was cheaper than just cable internet, but there is no way we could even watch many of the stations we used to subscribe to.  It was a waste of money (and probably time and brain cells too).Over draft/over limit/other bank and credit card fees.  For a number of years I was paying fees upon fees due to my lack of money and general irresponsibility when it came to my financial life.  Fortunately I've mastered basic checkbook balancing and have pulled myself out of debt so I am not writing checks and crossing my fingers hoping that the checks wouldn't bounce before I somehow got money into my bank account to cover them.Couponing myself into debt.  When couponing became really popular (remember the Coupon Queens who made the news on a regular basis?) I would cut coupons like a maniac and buy buy buy with them.  I wasn't one of those people who actually got cash back from the store so I basically ended up buying a bunch of stuff that we would never use and even though the items were discounted with coupons it was still a waste of money.Eating out All. The. Time.  While we eat out occasionally now, it is almost all free with hubby's comps.  Before we were just busy and tired and put no effort into meal planning or meal prep so when meal time rolled around we often opted for the nearest restaurant which, needless to say, is a very expensive way to eat.Water/gas/electricity.  Obviously we can't totally go without these basic utilities, but we are way less wasteful with these things now.  Years ago we just paid whatever the bill was when it arrived each month (we also lived in a more temperate climate at the time).  But when we moved to Las Vegas and our first summer electric bill arrived to the tune of nearly $200 for a small, one bedroom condo, something had to change.  We upped the setting on our thermostat then read the electric meter daily for a couple of months to figure out where all of our money was going.  This really opened our eyes to how much electricity we were using (we also did this with water and gas and made efforts to conserve these utilities as well)."},

{"title": "10 Ways I Save Money on Tech Stuff", "date": "Tuesday, July 3, 2018", "text": "Some random things I do that save me a lot of money on tech stuff:I buy my internet domain names at NameCheap so they are only $10 per year (other places charge much more).I host my websites through In Motion; with their bulk hosting plan I can host as many sites as I want for $200 a year.I have had TMobile forever for my cell service and I often check to see what their latest plans are (we got in on one of their plans a while back which gives us three lines--one for me, one for hubby, one for one of the kids--with unlimited everything for $100 total).I buy all of my tech stuff on sale after massive amounts of research.  My favorite places to buy things are through the Best Buy's 'deal of the day', through Tech Bargains, when TMobile or Samsung has half off their cell phones specials, and sometimes at Costco when there is a good sale.I get my software via Tech Soup through a non profit I do work for.  It is highly discounted and is an excellent deal (but for non-profits only).I also make use of lots of free online software (Libre Office for hubby's computers, free online photo editors, etc).For work, when I have to organize call-in meetings, I use GoToMeeting and freeconferencecall.com.  Google Docs is also excellent for collaborative writing projects.For internet it is similar to cell phone plans; I keep an eye out for any sales or specials on internet service from our local provider (Cox), most recently they had a plan where it was cheaper to get internet and basic cable TV for a flat rate and they said the price will never change so I grabbed that deal and we are pretty happy with it!I absolutely LOVE the Kindle app on my cell/tablet/computer.  Our library is really amazing anyway but they have so many online services now that from their website I can download all kinds of free things from books to music to movies to magazines, etc.Finally, online banking has saved me a lot of hassle and effort.  I have three banks, two not even in our city, and I mostly do all of my banking online.  All of my paychecks are automatically deposited into my bank account, all checks are deposited through the app on my phone, nearly all of our bills are paid online, we can transfer money to the kids for free...I'm not sure how we all lived without online banking in the past!"},

{"title": "10 Frugal Death Tips", "date": "Friday, June 29, 2018", "text": "When pondering what to write about today, a common topic recently has been death (people have been dropping like flies lately), so here are ten ways to make death cheaper:Consider cremation instead of burial (it's cheaper).Consider donating your body to science (it's even cheaper than cremation since when science is done with your body, cremation is provided for free).Instead of an elaborate viewing/wake, funeral ceremony, embalming, fancy casket, etc. consider having just a memorial ceremony which can literally be held anywhere (sans body).  Public park, the beach, a family member's home...even a bar or bowling alley if that is something that would resonate with the loved one in question.For people who must have a funeral, pre-planning and pre-paying for the entire funeral and cremation/burial can be a cheaper way to go.If the deceased was a veteran, check out the death/burial benefits available for qualified vets.If you need a casket, Google \"cheap caskets\".  Who knew Walmart had an entire casket section?Did you know that in many states it is perfectly legal to bury people on your own property?Buy individual items for the memorial service/funeral yourself instead of getting an (expensive) package deal.  Besides buying a casket online you can also buy urns online (often cheaper than what you can buy through a funeral home), provide your own flowers for the service, find your own caterer/order in food yourself, make your own funeral cards/funeral programs/prayer cards/etc.Consider crowd-funding for funeral costs (this is often done when there is an unexpected death such as when a child dies).Take out a small insurance policy/start a savings account specifically to cover death and funeral costs in the future."},

{"title": "Another Post on Health", "date": "Sunday, June 24, 2018", "text": "It's been a pretty wild week around here, most of the drama having to do with health.  So my message today is to TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH.  Not only will this save a lot of money (especially for those in the US where one minor medical  problem can bankrupt you) but it will also save so much sadness and drama and suffering.Here's the update: the relative who had open heart surgery was sent to a rehab facility where he very nearly died (sounds like from neglectful care) and is back in the ER as I type this.  This is the same relative who I chatted with right after hubby's heart attack and he told me he had similar issues (diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol) and got tired of his doctor ranting at him so he solved the problem by just not going back to the doctor.  Turns out he probably should have been listening to his doctor.  When my sister just went to visit him she said he was so broken down she barely recognized him(!).  Sad.  The other relative who died and then was resuscitated told his family he would be dead by the next day.  Incredibly enough he was.  ER staff will tell you that when a patient tells them they will die soon they are quite often right.  Sadly this relative had a litany of health problems and suffered from them FOR YEARS.The thing to do: exercise every single day (I know an 85 year old guy who can run circles around people half his age--literally.  He exercises every single day for a couple hours and his health is still excellent).  Eat well (I am a big fan of the whole food plant based diet).  Manage stress (yoga? meditation? deep breathing?  Whatever works for you).  Track and manage your health markers (weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood glucose levels, etc).My wish for you is health and happiness and good health goes a long way towards long-term happiness!"},
{"title": "On Getting a 15 Year Mortgage", "date": "Saturday, June 23, 2018", "text": "I came across this article on 15 year mortgages today.  I am a fan of 15 year mortgages as they can save you A LOT of money over a regular 30 year mortgage.  We had a 15 year mortgage on the first house we bought and, like clockwork, we owned our house free and clear after 15 years.  We then used that house as a rental for a few years until we sold it so nearly all money from our renters was pure profit.For our most recent home purchase we went with a 30 year mortgage for many of the reasons listed in the article.  First, we didn't really know what our income would be and didn't want to lock ourselves into the higher payments required by a 15 year mortgage.  We also didn't know how the market would go (it was near the bottom of the housing market when we bought here in Vegas) and also didn't know how long we would be living here.On the one hand, having a 15 year mortgage forces you to pay off your mortgage twice as fast as with a 30 year mortgage which is a good thing,  You build equity much fast, save on interest, and can cancel PMI insurance quicker.  On the other hand, if something happens with your income making higher than usual mortgage payments can be a scary situation to be in.In the case of a 30 year mortgage, if you don't have a pre-payment penalty, you can easily make extra payments on the principal and still pay off your mortgage faster than usual (this take a bit of discipline though).So it is a personal decision whether to get a 15 or 30 year mortgage, based on your own circumstances, but a 15 year mortgage is definitely something to look into!"},

{"title": "Keeping Cool in the Summer", "date": "Tuesday, June 12, 2018", "text": "It's a beautiful day in Las Vegas today (see photo above).  Actually it is a beautiful HOT day as the temps got to 107 degrees this afternoon!  In order to stay cool and save money, here are some things we do:We keep the air conditioning on 79 when we are home, 78 at night, and 85 when we aren't home.  I know some people like the temperature to be around 70 degrees in their home but after you are acclimated to the hot weather, 70 degrees is freezing!We are gone all day (and usually in air conditioned casinos).  So basically we let someone else pay to keep us cool.  In fact, most casinos are so cold inside that you need to wear a jacket!We keep the blinds pulled on the \"hot\" side of the house (the east side in the morning, the west side in the evening).Some people use sun shades and sun screens on their windows but we haven't done that (I'm not sure it would save that much money).We do maintenance on our air conditioning system before and after each hot season to hopefully extend the life of the system.We pay our electricity bill in full each month so we expect higher bills in the summer however people can opt to even out their bills for the year and pay an average amount each month (basically the power company adds up how much your house should need to pay for electricity each month for a year and divides the amount by 12 to help people not have to pay massively high bills during the summer).We water very early in the morning or late in the evening to save water and money--watering during the day isn't a good idea as the water evaporates basically before it hits the ground!Our house is fairly new so the seals around the doors and windows are still good.  Older houses will leak cool air in the summer and heated air in the winter which costs a lot of money.Each room has a ceiling fan which helps circulate the air (they should run counter-clockwise in the summer, clockwise in the winter).We tend to eat \"cool\" meals in the summer and/or cook outside on the barbecue instead of using the oven which adds heat to the house.Fortunately we have whole home air conditioning but in our house in Seattle we didn't have an AC system so on the rare days when it got really hot, we would hang out and sleep in the lowest level of our house where is was much cooler than the top floor of the house."},

{"title": "Dodged a Bullet", "date": "Wednesday, June 6, 2018", "text": "So I was feeling kind of bad that I didn't help my cousin out when she needed to bail her son out of jail a few days ago.  Our rules for loaning money (never do this), giving money (only if we have extra to give), and never paying bail for anyone (a hard and fast rule), have in this case, paid off in spades.The last I heard from my cousin was that she bailed her kid out of jail and it was no big deal, some sort of misunderstanding.  I figured that a lawyer would get everything figured out and her and her son would be fine.  Then last night I Googled around to see what came up using her kid's name and I found an entire article about his arrest, complete with the most horrific details of child porn and possible \"hands on\" victims that I had ever read in a family newspaper.  OMG.  While these are still allegations and there has been no trial yet, just reading about all of the charges and evidence that was recovered was enough to make me want to throw up.  If I would have broke our money rules because I felt sorry for the tough spot my cousin was in, and then found out what he was arrested for after having helped him get out of jail, I would have been utterly freaking out right now.  If the allegations are true, he should definitely not be walking around in public right now, and if he is found guilty I doubt that he will see the outside of a prison for a good 15 to 20 years!  I am so irked with my cousin I never want to speak to her again for making this entire situation sound like no big deal when it is A VERY BIG DEAL.  Ugh."},

{"title": "10 Summer Vacation Tips", "date": "Saturday, June 2, 2018", "text": "While we aren't planning to travel this summer (at least not at this point but I would like to do a marathon in each state so that is on the agenda for some future date), a lot of people will be hitting the road this summer for vacation.  Here are ten ways to save money on your summer travels:Look at all transportation options: driving, renting a car, taking the train, taking the bus, flying, taking a cheap bus such as Megabus or Bolt Bus, taking a cruise ship, etc.  Sometimes the most obvious way to get somewhere is the most expensive, especially during the high tourist season.Spend cash.  When you put your vacation on a credit card you are more likely to spend more money than planned and less likely to immediately pay the card off.  A cash-only vacation doesn't leave you with the credit card hangover after all you return home from your trip.Bring or buy your own food as much as possible.  I live in a tourist destination and I can tell you that eating on the Las Vegas Strip or downtown Fremont is super expensive compared to either visiting off-Strip restaurants or shopping at local grocery stores for things like snacks and breakfast/lunch picnic foods.See if you can find a discount pass for your destination.  If you will be hitting some National Parks, an annual parks pass can be much cheaper than paying regular-priced entry at each park.  Many cities also have an Entertainment Book with tons of two-for-one restaurant coupons, as well as \"city passes\" which get you in to several tourist attractions for a low flat rate.Visit family or friends while you travel and you can save money on lodging.  Similarly, doing things like staying in Air BnBs or youth hostels as well as staying loyal to one hotel chain which gives you a free night for every few nights you book can help you save some lodging dollars.If you must fly, try to be flexible with your dates (flying on a Saturday may be twice the cost of flying on a Tuesday for example), travel with only one carry-on bag, and skip the extras if possible (things like picking a seat ahead of time or choosing seats with extra leg room can cost a lot more).Try to travel in the less high, high season.  Summer travel in general is more expensive but you can still save a little money by traveling in early June or late August as well as avoiding holidays weekend when everyone and their brother is trying to go on vacation.Plan to visit a few big attractions and many smaller, cheaper attractions.  You could literally spend tens of thousands of dollars in Las Vegas doing all of the major tourist things ($5000 for a booth in a night club with bottle service, $500 for a deluxe machine gun package, etc) but there are plenty of free and cheap things to do here that are still a lot of fun and very memorable.  All of the Smithsonian museums and zoo are free in Washington DC, we visited a very nice free zoo in Chicago a while back, walking in the mountains or on the beach is free, etc.Instead of the usual tourist vacations (London, New York, Tokyo) consider cheaper or more unique alternatives.  A cruise may be a good idea as everything is included for one price (lodging, food, and entertainment).  Instead of visiting Tokyo, Osaka or Kyushu are just as nice and much cheaper.  A stay-cation is always an interesting option (depending on where you live).  And staying in smaller nearby cities may be just as interesting and fun as the large city you fly into (ie: Victoria is just as nice--maybe nicer in my opinion--than Vancouver BC; Bath is just as historical as London).Travel during the off-season or shoulder season.  If you can work all summer (as yours truly is doing) you can make your vacation dollars go a lot further by vacationing in the spring or fall.  There are less tourists then and prices tend to be lower."},
{"title": "Arrested!", "date": "Friday, June 1, 2018", "text": "In a bit of drama last night, my cousin called in a panic saying her son had been arrested and she asked if she could borrow money for bail and a lawyer.  Unfortunately I had to tell her no (in as kind a way as I could).  I simply told her I didn't have any money and she knows I don't work so I guess she moved on to someone else to ask.  My reasons for saying no are several...She asked for a loan of $10,000.  I don't have $10,000 to give someone and we don't loan money to anyone (they usually don't pay it back and you end up without the money you loaned plus the relationship with the person you loaned the money to usually goes south as well).  If someone needs money we see what we have to GIVE them (if we feel it is for a good cause) and don't expect it back.She then asked if I had a credit card she could use then she would pay the payments on the card.  Again, I said no.  I know her track record with money and she is ALWAYS broke (yet somehow seems to buy all kinds of crap on credit), is often hounded by creditors, and is pretty lousy with money in general.  Needless to say I am not going to tank my credit--or get stuck with credit card bills--by letting someone use my credit card.  Again, if we don't have the money to give, we don't offer the money.I only got the very basics from her, something about her adult son who did something on his computer a few years ago (not clear what), so the police showed up with an arrest warrant for her son and a warrant to search her house (he lives with her), and they ended up carting off her son and all electronics in the house.  That doesn't sound good.  My position on bailing people out of jail is that if they did the crime, they get to do the time.  Almost always, if law enforcement goes to the trouble of going to a judge and putting someone's name on a warrant, they have pretty convincing evidence that a crime was committed.  The amount I know about bail bonds could fit in a thimble so I did a bit of research and found out that when you bail someone out through a bail bondsman, you don't get back the thousands of dollars you pay to the bondsman.  I think his bond is upwards of $5,000.  That's a lot of money to never see again.I know a bit more about lawyers and they cost a fortune, especially for more complicated cases.  I believe her son has or will have a court appointed attorney (they are free-ish but depending on the person's circumstances, they may be required to pay something for the attorney).   Overall, I feel bad that I can't help.  I think it would be completely traumatizing to suddenly have your kid thrown in jail and any mom would look high and low for ways to help their child, but on the other hand, getting involved in your adult child's legal drama can leave a parent broker than broke--a bad situation, especially if you are already middle aged and have a very limited income and little to no savings."},

{"title": "Time to Sell Our House? Part 2", "date": "Saturday, May 26, 2018", "text": "Thanks to everyone who commented on yesterday's post!  You all gave me several things to think about.  Our main impetus for moving are:There's too many people in Las Vegas!  The city gets about 50,000 people moving here each year.  We can really tell that traffic has increased, houses are being built everywhere, crime is increasing, and it's just generally too busy here.There is some concern about future water supply.  We live in a desert, get only a small slice of Colorado River water, yet people continue to flock here.  Our water reservoir is literally drying up!We would like to move to our \"forever house\" while we are still able to move ourselves.  We would like a single story house, and would like to be active enough to do most of the moving ourselves (we recently had friends who are near 80 pack up their 2500 sq ft house prior to a move...color me surprised at their energy and strength to do this!).It would be great to take the equity in our home and pay cash for a new house.  This means we would need to move somewhere that has a lower cost for housing (ie: Tennessee where new houses can be bought for under $150k as opposed to Seattle where new homes start at $777k!). We would also like to live closer to the kids who all live on the East Coast.  On the other hand:The weather here is perfect--even in the middle of summer.  Everywhere else we have considered moving to has snow, ice, torrential rain, etc.  Hubby is very clear that he doesn't want to shovel snow or slip on the ice and break a hip!  eeekkkLife here is soooo easy.  I don't need to work since we can easily live frugally here, there is so much--mostly free--entertainment here 24/7, property tax and utilities here are very cheap, and there is shopping and great restaurants everywhere here.There are no natural disasters here.  The west coast has earthquakes, the deep south has hurricanes, the mid south has tornadoes, and our friends in New England had a seemingly unending winter with snow for months this past winter.We already have a lot of friends here.  While I am used to a small town where you literally know everyone, we do know quite a few people here already and settling into a new place would mean finding new social groups to join and new friends to make.Hubby hates change.  How I got him to sell nearly everything we owned and travel for a couple years nearly a decade ago is beyond me.  These days he likes his routine.  He doesn't even want to travel anymore as the hassle and headaches of traveling make it less and less appealing as we get older.I'm sure we will continue to debate this issue a while longer..."},
{"title": "Time to Sell Our House?", "date": "Friday, May 25, 2018", "text": "We have been debating whether or not to sell our house and move for ages.  Now looks like a great time to sell since the value of our house has more than doubled since we bought it.  Or should we wait and hope the price will increase even more?  What if we wait too long and the housing bubble bursts and the value of our house drops like a rock (this happened in Las Vegas back in 2008)?  What if we sell our house but can't find another house to buy?  Many houses here are getting a stack of offers the minute they hit the market so people often have to make a dozen or more offers before they can find a house to buy.  What if we move away to another state then decide we don't like it as much as we like Las Vegas and want to move back?  Believe it or not we know several people who got tired of Las Vegas, moved away, then moved back within a few years because they found that Vegas was actually a pretty good place to live comparatively.  Is it worth it to uproot ourselves again after we have made a lot of friends and become a part of the community only to have to resettle somewhere else?  Where should we move to?  This has been the biggest issue for us as we have several places in mind but no one *perfect* place.  So the debate goes on..."},

{"title": "Can You Cover a $400 Emergency Expense?", "date": "Tuesday, May 22, 2018", "text": "According to this article, 40% of Americans CAN'T cover a $400 emergency expense which is really concerning.  It isn't if but when an emergency will happen and the fix will require money.  Just within the last year or so we have had several unexpected expenses, some of which would have been big problems if we hadn't had the savings to cover them including a dead hot water heater, a 30 day notice to paint all of the trim around the house by the HOA, plumbing issues, and kid issues (ie: a couple of kids had unexpected emergencies and didn't have the savings to cover the problem so we gave them the money).Needless to say, having money in savings is critical for your peace of mind and well being.  Every day people have financial issues which can range from minor (they don't have enough money for an impromptu lunch out with co workers) to major (they get sick, miss days at work, their paycheck is short, and they can't cover the rent which leads to eviction!).The need for an emergency fund is so important, that even if you are swimming in debt, financial expert Dave Ramsey recommends that you put aside money in an emergency fund first to cover unexpected emergencies before doing anything else to get out of debt.If you don't yet have an emergency fund, this should be your top priority.  You can find several ways to quickly bulk up your emergency fund here, here, and here."},

{"title": "Beware Associated Costs When You Buy Something", "date": "Friday, May 18, 2018", "text": "As we are trying to figure out what the most frugal way to fix our fish tank is (the lights burned out on the hood and they aren't replaceable...a new hood costs $20) it got me to thinking about the additional costs of buying just about anything. In the case of the fish, we were at Walmart a few years back and hubby decided to buy some cute goldfish.  They were feeder fish so they only cost 15 cents each but the ongoing costs to keep those suckers alive is orders of magnitude more than what they originally cost!  So far we have bought two complete tanks/hoods/filter systems as they have grown, fish food is a regular cost, and when we travel we need to find someone to feed them, not to mention that they are messy so hubby cleans their tank once a week which is a major undertaking.  So much for fish who started out costing a couple of quarters!Pretty much everything we buy has additional costs.  When you buy a cell phone you then need to buy a cover for it, buy an additional memory card, maybe buy a car charger for it.  When you buy a laptop there are additional costs for a padded cover, maybe software costs, etc.  When we bought our new car we needed seat covers, a dash cam, an emergency kit, regular car washes and regular maintenance service like oil changes...So today's lesson is to think about all of the associated costs you will need to pay when you buy many consumer items.  You might think buying an item on sale is a great deal but it pays to calculate the additional costs associated with the item to figure out if it really is the great deal you originally thought it was."},

{"title": "10 Things to Buy Now In Order to Save Money in the Future", "date": "Wednesday, May 9, 2018", "text": "I am pretty frugal and always try to get the best deals.  If I can't find a great deal I can usually go without or put off my purchase until later in order to save money.  There are some things, however, that it doesn't pay to skimp on or put off purchasing...Dental care.  By spending the money to get your teeth cleaned and examined every six months you can catch problems when they are small and cheap to repair (instead of crowns and root canals and such).Quality cooking implements.  Good pans and good knives cost money but the upside to buying these items even though they cost more is less food waste (burning food in cheap pans is a waste of food and money).  We also went through several cheap knives before buying expensive, high-quality knives that will last a lifetime.Quality shoes.  Especially if you are on your feet all day or walk/run a lot for exercise.  Cheap shoes will make your feet feel awful while sturdy, good quality shoes will make your feet feel great.  It's much better to spend more to feel better and this will also save you money on podiatrist costs in the future!Quality food.  As an example, we used to buy the cheap canned spaghetti sauce that I could often find on sale for less than a dollar.  Now that we are paying attention to our diet in an effort to become healthier, I read all of the labels on the food I buy.  The higher quality spaghetti sauce (where the first few ingredients AREN'T sugar) costs twice what the cheap stuff does but since it is much better for our health than something with three kinds of sugar in it, it is well worth the cost (and well worth future healthcare cost reduction!).Non-stop, direct flights.  I used to just buy the cheapest flight to where ever we were going then suffer through the stress/missed connections/many extra hours on the road just to save money.  Again, our health and well-being is more important than saving a bit of extra money.Birth control.  Needless to say, having kids is ridiculously expensive.  Being able to plan when to have kids instead of popping them out willy nilly will save you money now and in the future.Paying off debt.  You can save a lot of your future money by paying off debt ASAP.  Never buy a \"great deal\" with a credit card because the deal becomes less and less great the more that the interest payments pile up.Education.  I should clarify that some educational expenditures are well worth the money now because it can earn/save you more money in the future.  A degree in basket weaving is a dubious investment, but some people let debt freak them out even though they are on a good educational track (like nursing school or working on an IT degree) and decide to drop out.  The only thing worse than being in student loan debt with a degree is being in student loan debt and having NO degree.Required things.  Some people \"save\" money by not paying their car insurance and letting it lapse.  Obviously this is a bad idea and can have future legal and financial repercussions.  Ditto child support payments, paying speeding tickets on time, etc.Anything that impacts your safety and security.  A child safety seat for your kid, a helmet if you ride a bike or motorcycle, a taxi after a night out if you have been drinking...basically anything will will save you from having huge medical/legal costs if you don't have the item."},

{"title": "10 Frugal Things About Las Vegas", "date": "Saturday, May 5, 2018", "text": "Yesterday I pointed out how many of the popular Vegas things are actually pretty expensive for tourists.  But for locals, the people who live here, Las Vegas can be a pretty frugal place!Free over the air TV.  As soon as we moved here we bought over-the-air antennas for our TVs and found that we got more than 50 stations free which meant we didn't have cable TV for years.  We recently got basic cable as part of our internet package because it was cheaper to have the TV/internet package than just internet by itself for some reason.  We still have four of our TVs on antennas because we didn't want to pay for cable boxes for TVs we don't use very often.Vegas is also a great place for military and vets.  We get a good discount on our car registration, we get free buffets every Memorial Day and Veteran's Day, and there are lots of other military/vets discounts on all kinds of things from attractions to special events.The library system here is AMAZING.  I've downloaded thousands of free library books to my Kindle, we have borrowed all kinds of movies, and they have all kinds of special events at the library from live bands and dance ensembles to author meet and greets and other community events.There is a lot of entertainment here that can be off-the-chart expensive, but there are also a lot of wonderful free and inexpensive things to do here as well (here is a list of 100 of these things).Food can be really inexpensive here as well.  Whether it is the late night specials at the casinos (like the $4.99 steak and egg breakfast at Southpoint), free comped meals if you gamble here (hubby earns $1-$2 per hour in comps from playing poker), or the myriad of cheap grocery stores (99 cent store, Mexican and Asian stores, highly discounted loss leaders at regular grocery stores), you can eat in Vegas really well and really cheaply.Taxes and utilities seem very inexpensive here compared to other places we have lived.  Property taxes are low and have an annual cap to keep them from increasing as steeply as housing costs do.  And for some reason our water bill here in the middle of the desert is about $24 per month while in Seattle where there is water everywhere, our water bill usually ran about $45 a month?!  Other utilities seem less expensive as well.Speaking of utilities, many of our utility companies offer freebies and rebates for customers (examples here, here, and here).What ever your interests are, it's a good bet there is a club, group, or organization that can (inexpensively) meet your needs in Las Vegas.  There are free guided hikes at Red Rock Canyon, one of the best (free!) genealogy libraries in the country is here, this place is a photographer's dream, and there are so many opportunities to volunteer at events then get free passes to enjoy the rest of the event (like volunteer one day at the Electric Daisy Carnival then get free passes to the rest of the event (a $200 value).Even though some of the venues and experiences may seem kind of expensive for tourists, just by showing your locals ID, residents can get all kinds of locals discounts on shows, events, and other things in Vegas.We have the best Goodwills in the country.  There are a lot of Goodwill stores all over the valley, everyday they have some sort of discount (including $1 day when everything is a dollar!), and because people come here from everywhere and are pretty transient, they tend to donate all kinds of great things (hubby got a brand new Fly Emirates shirt which we found at an airport store for $90 yet he paid $4 for it at the Goodwill!)."},
{"title": "10 Un-Frugal Things About Las Vegas", "date": "Friday, May 4, 2018", "text": "The hubby and I used to come to Las Vegas on vacation several times each year before we finally moved here about seven years ago.  There were a lot of things we loved about Vegas back then like cheap air fare, cheap but nice hotel rooms, cheap entertainment, and especially so much cheap food.  These days Las Vegas is getting to be less and less a fun discount destination. As locals we rarely ever go to the Strip where they seem to take advantage of their captive tourist audience by finding more and more ways to wring money out of them.  But people seem to be voting with their money as fewer people are coming to Las Vegas, something pointed out in this recent article.  These are10 un-frugal things to watch out for in Las Vegas...Parking fees.  Most of the major Strip casinos charge for parking now (even for hotel guests) and that can be an extra $10 to $20 per day (!).Resort fees.  Resort fees, a daily fee added on top of the price you pay for your hotel room, can more than double the price that you think you will pay for your room.  And these \"special fees\" cover the things people used to get for free with their room like access to the pool, gym, local phone calls, etc.A CNF (Concession and Franchise Fee) surcharge is charged at several restaurants on the Strip.  It's sort of like a resort fee for restaurants (and an utter rip off IMHO).Comped drink monitoring system.  Vegas used to be famous for giving gamblers free drinks while they were playing in the casinos but that is sadly going away as well.  These days casinos are heading towards a \"comped drink monitoring system\" which monitors how much money you play in order to determine if or when you get a free drink.Room taxes are really really high.  Guess who pays for a myriad of county services in Las Vegas?  Tourists, of course, as they are taxed out the nose for their hotel room in order to fund many county services for the locals.Our pubic transit system is rather meh for a large city.  Thus the need for taxis, thus the common practice of long-hauling tourists which means that they end up with a really expensive taxi ride.  Fortunately Uber and Lyft are better alternatives these days.Strip clubs.  Vegas is famous for being sin city and part of the \"sin\" experience is the plethora of topless and nude strip clubs.  Needless to say there are a lot of ways for these clubs to rip off tourists (NSFW).Tourists are also a big target for timeshare sales people.  Many hotels in Las Vegas have time share people trying to hustle a sale by offering free buffets and free shows (along with hours of hard-sell tactics to get you to cough up money for a timeshare every year for the rest of your life).Even the odds of winning when you gamble here are being tightened up.  I don't gamble but apparently many gamblers can tell when pay out percentages are getting smaller and smaller.Cheap, tasty food in Las Vegas is pretty much a thing of the past.  Nearly all food in tourist areas is expensive.  Drinks are expensive, breakfast is expensive, dinner is really expensive.  My tip is to hit up the 99 cent store or a grocery store on your way into town and at least buy snacks, drinks for your room, and breakfast food in order to save a bit of money during your stay."},
{"title": "What Happens to Your Debt When You Die", "date": "Thursday, May 3, 2018", "text": "If you need even more reason to get out of debt as soon as possible, this article on what happens to your debt when you die should inspire you to action.  If you think it is difficult for you and your SO to pay the mortgage and car payment and credit card bills now, image what it would be like to dump all of that debt on a grieving spouse.  The article goes on to detail what happens to other kinds of debt, including student loan debt which can be OK-ish (federal student loan debt is forgiven when the student dies) to horrific (with private student loans the co-signer--often a parent--is stuck with the entirety of the student loan debt if the student dies).Hopefully you live a long and enjoyable life but everyone needs to know about the ramifications of leaving a large amount of debt behind if they should die early and the impact this could have on your family!"},
{"title": "My \"To Buy\" List", "date": "Wednesday, May 2, 2018", "text": "I keep lots of lists--lists of things I need to do, grocery shopping lists so I don't forget a crucial part of a meal, a list of appointments and meetings I can't miss, and a \"to buy\" list where I write down all of the things I want to buy that aren't so critical that I need to run out and get it now.So far this year I have pretty much stuck to my no-spend goal for this year.  We haven't traveled anywhere since the beginning of the year, if there is something I want I try to find it at the Goodwill first, and I have bought exactly one thing online so far this year (a half-off day pack from REI).  So far so good.But there are still several things I want to buy yet don't absolutely have to have.  I would like a waffle maker but haven't been able to find one at the Goodwill yet (the ones I've seen there were pretty cruddy), and I would also like an air popper (I currently make popcorn the old fashioned way with a deep, heavy pan on the stove...it works).  I have a Dell XPS 13\" laptop which I have been using for four years that I would like to replace with a new version but the laptop still works perfectly so this isn't a critical need (I had bought a 15\" laptop for home use but rarely used it and got tired of transferring files back and forth so it went back to the store). Other things on the list that I would like to have include a new tile floor in the house, all new appliances, a dash cam for hubby's van which we rarely ever drive...  Eventually some of the things on the list fall off when I realize I don't really want the item any more and since the list is prioritized (most wanted things at the top of the list), things may move up and down the list by order of importance so stuff at the bottom of the list are probably things I don't really want or need.I think keeping this sort of list is a good way to determine if something is just a passing fancy or something that is really really wanted.  It also keeps the items top of mind so that if a super great sale comes up I will know that I have been looking for the item for a while and be able to determine if the sale price is really great or just OK.  It also seems to keep me from buying things as I know that I can eventually get the items but don't need it right now so it can just hang out on the list until I have the cash to get it.  List psychology...it works!"},
{"title": "Watching the Housing Market", "date": "Tuesday, May 1, 2018", "text": "We have been casually looking for other places to move to over the past year, mostly to get out of a big and growing bigger every day city.  It seems to be a very good time to make our move as our local news keeps noting that the housing market may be getting too hot--like to the point of imploding like it did here about ten years ago.  Back then there were so many buyers bidding up the prices of houses and there was so much building (in addition to other financial shenanigans like maxing out home equity loans and offering home loans to people who in no way could afford them) that it eventually reached a critical point and the market imploded.  Over less than a year many houses lost half of their value or more which then caused a lot of foreclosures and people just walking away from homes that they owed much more on that what they were worth.We bought a house here when housing values were nearly at their lowest and since then our house has more than doubled in value.  We would love to sell our house here and use the proceeds from the sale to pay cash for a new house in a place where homes are much cheaper.So far it looks like the south may be the place to go.  Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina all seem to have a lot of new houses being built with prices that are half the cost of buying a similar house here (like a four bed, three bath house for $250k which would now cost upwards of $450k here).  I guess that is sort of \"playing the market\" when it comes to housing but to be retired with a completely paid off house seems like a very good move to me!  Now to decide where to move to..."},

{"title": "27 Things You Are Probably Wasting Money On", "date": "Sunday, April 29, 2018", "text": "I saw this article (actually slide show) over at the Motley Fool and I am happy to say that while I probably did waste money in every way they list (and then some) in the past, I have been able to reign in my spending quite a bit in recent years.  How does your spending stack up in these categories?Bank fees.  Fortunately all of our banks are credit unions which charge no fees and one national bank which charges us no fees because they hold our mortgage.Late fees.  We haven't paid our bills late in years so no late fees in years which is a big money saver (years ago it was a totally different story, I hate to think about how much money we wasted back then in late fees).Unclaimed 401(k) matches.  None of our jobs have ever offered this sort of account so this is a N/A for us.Unclaimed tax deductions and credits.  Our taxes are pretty basic these days so no deductions or credits for us.Credit card interest.  Hubby always pays off his credit card each month.  I am paying down the one credit card I carry a balance on and it has a 0% interest fee for a year (at which time it should be paid off).Extended warranties.  I never buy the extended warranty on any product.  If the item has really good reviews and at least a one year manufacturer's warranty it usually works just fine for its lifetime.Airline fees.  We are the cheapest travelers.  We travel off-peak and chose cheap tickets, we only travel with one carry on each, and bring our own food and water when we travel.New cars.  I did buy a new car a couple years ago because I wanted something that would be dependable for years to come.  I got a 0.9% interest loan and am paying it off as quickly as possible.Driving too fast.  We don't speed, no tickets (knock on wood), and we don't actually drive much (about 8000 miles a year).Premium gas.  We use the cheapest gas at the gas station and it seems to work fine.Brand-name medications.  Fortunately all of the medications we need are free through the military otherwise I would definitely be looking for any way possible to save money on this.Bottled water.  We only drink bottled water (bought on sale) because the tap water here in Vegas is yuck.  We tried using a Brita filter but it didn't seem to make the water taste much better.Food you don't eat.  We have been really good about just buying what we need, cooking at home as much as possible, and eating all leftovers so I don't think we waste much money on this.Flavored beverages.  We buy these occasionally but don't drink them on a daily basis.  I'm a big fan of seltzer water which is healthier and cheaper than soda.Dining out.  We have cut way back on this for health reasons and when we do dine out it is free with hubby's poker comps.Convenience foods.  We do buy bagged and cut vegetables occasionally but we only buy these at the 99 cent store so this is often cheaper than buying the same vegetables at a regular grocery store.Fancy coffee.  This is my downfall!  I love fancy coffee frapuccinos (I try to use coupons and get discount drink cards, etc).Dry cleaning.  We haven't used dry cleaning in years.  When I quit working all of my business suits went to the thrift store.  No dry clean-only clothes means no dry cleaning bills.Unnecessary laundry products.  We use basic laundry soap, cold water, and no dryer sheets.Paper towels.  People who come to visit are always surprised that our paper towels on the roll are tiny.  We buy the ones already preforated in half and then cut the towels in half right down the middle which means each time we pull off a paper towel it comes off as a quarter sheet!Phantom electricity.  I have a habit of unplugging anything we aren't using.Lottery tickets.  There are no lottery tickets to buy in Las Vegas so this is a non-starter.  Hubby has a small allowance for playing poker here, however.Cable TV.  We have basic cable since it was cheaper to get a basic cable/internet package than it was just to have basic internet.Phone service.  We haven't had a home phone in years and our cell phone plan is pretty good (three lines for $100, one of which we gave to one of the kids).Unused memberships.  I just went through our list of memberships a couple days ago and got rid of ones that we don't use much.Unclaimed rebates.  I immediately claim any rebate we are entitled to.Impulse buying.  We don't shop much other than for food so this has the added bonus of nothing to buy on impulse!"},

{"title": "So Many Subscriptions", "date": "Friday, April 27, 2018", "text": "While looking at our budget, I realized we have accumulated quite a few subscription and auto-renew bills.  So I went through them and decided what to do with each one...We have a Costco card which costs $60 per year and will be up for renewal soon.  We actually don't really shop at Costco very often, maybe three or four times a year, so will probably not renew the card but just ask the SIL to get us gift cards which will allow us to go in and shop at Costco the few times each year we need things.My annual web hosting service fee is coming up but at $190 a year it is a bargain as it allows me to host as many websites as I want to, some of which I charge a monthly fee to my clients for so that's a definite keeper.We have a Netflix subscription for which we pay $10.99 a month but I saw on an advertisement that if you have T Mobile you can get a free Netflix subscription so I am going to give them a call this week and see how that works.  If we qualify I will just cancel our current subscription and get the freebie subscription.Some of our bills we pay annually or semi-annually.  There is no changing the cost of our HOA or sewer bill but we do get a small discount if we pay these semi-annually/annually.We also pay our car insurance and home insurance semi-annually (car) and annually (house) but before I pay these bills I usually call around and see if there are any better deals to be hand with other insurance companies.Amazon Prime service.  Since they just announced they are raising their Prime price to $119 a year I will be cancelling the service on our annual renewal date.  I like the free shipping around Christmas time but we don't use $120 worth of free shipping during the entire year.  Hubby likes watching movies on Prime but between Netflix and HBO I think he will survive without Prime movies.  You can also get Amazon Prime by the month so if I think we will spend more than $12.99 on shipping during a month leading up to Christmas we will just subscribe for the month."},

{"title": "10 Things From Today", "date": "Wednesday, April 25, 2018", "text": "It's been an interesting day...We get the best sunsets in Las Vegas (see photo above)!This was a kind of sad article about renting friends and family members when you don't have them in Japan.On a happier note (kind of?), this guy on reddit wrote up what his family should do financially if he dies or is incapacitated.  Most people don't think to do this but it is a good idea.  I may write up something like this for hubby.My friend was trying to thru hike the Appalachian Trail and I just heard that he was injured again (second serious foot injury) and is off-trail.  Hopefully he heals up and can finish this epic quest.The Latin Billboard Music Awards will be held here in Las Vegas tomorrow and, as often happens, the producers like to have a very full audience for filming so locals are given free tickets to be seat fillers and red carpet background people.  It's rather fascinating!Following up on my post a couple days ago, I got an email from Starbucks this morning--order online for the first time and get 65 stars!!  Ugh.  I didn't do it...today anyway...This was an interesting article about how the interest in single family houses is shifting.  Hubby and I have a house, each of the kids have houses (although one is deciding on moving soon, and another may be in transition soon), but lately, since we are thinking of moving anyway, we have tossed around the idea of buying a huge house (they are cheap in Tennessee and Georgia--like $450k for a seven bedroom brand new house) and having the kids and grandkids move in with us.  It would be a cheaper way to live for everyone, we wouldn't have to worry about the house when we travel since people would always be there, there would be more people around to help each other out (fixing things in the house, watching the kids in an emergency--we don't do that sort of thing on a regular basis, sharing meals), and it may be an easier way to grow older.  It's something for us to think about...It's going to be over 90 degrees tomorrow!  I love this weather!!!Also tomorrow, our brand new professional hockey team the Golden Knights will head towards the second round play-offs for the Stanley Cup.  That team went from nothing to amazing in a handful of months.  Wow!I've been watching the basic income story unfold for a few years.  It's an interesting idea, I just don't know if it could really work on a large scale.  Unfortunately the basic income experiment in Finland has just been stopped so I think this means it will be a long time from happening here."},
{"title": "I'm Feeling Psychologically Manipulated", "date": "Tuesday, April 24, 2018", "text": "It's probably my own fault.  I got a Starbucks gift card for my birthday a couple weeks ago so I downloaded the Starbucks app to my cell phone, loaded the gift card onto it, and the manipulation began!  I then purchased a drink via the app and it seemed like each morning after that I would wake up to a notice on the app about about a super special \"star dash\" or whatever it is they call it.  It would say something like buy a drink today and get 25 extra stars!  And then there would be more special star rewards if I buy one drink a day for a set number of days.  And then there would be a time limit.  And then there would be a note saying 'you didn't earn all of the stars you could have' since there were days when I didn't get a Starbucks drink.When you collect 125 bonus stars you are rewarded with a free drink through the app.  The part I didn't like about this is the time limit which develops a sense of urgency in the user and the part where they want you to buy a drink every single day for a set period of time.  I certainly don't need a 400 calorie beverage every single day but if I didn't get one every day I wouldn't get all of my bonus stars and then I would feel like I really missed out on a great deal.I much prefer my punch card for Baskin Robbins coffee drinks because of it's simplicity and lack of manipulation.  At BR, I get a dollar off coupon on the receipt each time I buy a drink and a punch card which would give me a free drink after purchasing seven drinks.  There is no time limit so I can get one drink a week and eventually earn a free drink.  With the Starbucks app it seems like someone put a lot of effort into developing a method to psychologically target people to make them buy more than they should, spend more money, and buy more often.So yesterday I got my free drink from Starbucks with my bonus stars then promptly deleted the app from my phone thus taking myself off of the \"star reward\" treadmill.  Whew...I'm glad I'm done with that--I feel more relaxed already!On a side note, I came across this article today about the way the Starbucks app tracks its users.  eekkkk"},
{"title": "10 Financial Situations to Avoid Like the Plague", "date": "Monday, April 23, 2018", "text": "I'm watching Judge Judy and the cases over the years have focused around money issues 90% of the time.  There are several financial situations that if avoided, will make your life MUCH simpler and happier...Never co-sign for anyone--even your mom, your kids, or your best friend.  If they require a co-signer it means their credit is crap and the chances of them bailing on the loan and you having to pay it off are pretty high.Never loan money to anyone.  Ditto the above.  People who can't get credit are more than likely bad credit risks and will not pay you back and the relationship will eventually be trashed.  When our kids need money we either give it to them as a gift or don't give them anything at all if we can't afford it.Never buy anything from a rent-to-own place.  The pay off price for a basic consumer item like a TV or washer and dryer set can be four or five times the cost of buying the item in a store.  People can make due with a thrift store/Craigslist item until they save up the money to buy the items they need without paying exorbitant interest rates.Don't buy a time share.  The price is ridiculous and the contracts are super hard to get out of so you can be stuck paying annual fees FOREVER.  Take the amount you would spend annually on a time share and pay for a really fabulous vacation, no strings attached.Never use one of those title loan/payday loan places.  Interest rates are ridiculously high (like 300%-700%!) and it's a good bet that you will end up in a continual cycle of debt trying to pay off these high interest loans by getting other high interest loans.Avoid membership plans in almost all cases.  Gym memberships are famous for being difficult to get out of, meanwhile they automatically charge your credit card every month for a service you may never use.  It is better to pay the higher month-to-month fee (in cash, not with a credit card) to use a gym until you are certain you will use the service AND you have an easy to understand contract with a simple exit clause.Student loans can be the bane of your existence for DECADES into your future.  If possible students should try to avoid loans all together by attending cheaper community colleges, doing high school/college programs which offer free tuition, applying for scholarships, and finding other ways to minimize college costs.  People who take out six-figure student loans to attend a dream school at 18 years old can pay for this way into their 40s and 50s!  As a side note, make sure the degree you are working towards has a reasonable chance of getting you a good paying job as student loans are not dischargable in bankruptcy.Don't lease a vehicle.  It's best to not even get a regular loan for a vehicle and instead pay cash for a junker until you can save up enough to pay cash for a car.  Paying for a loan--and interest--for the standard term of six to seven years on a car when its value is dropping like a rock is not a good investment.Think long and hard if you need an item that you will only use occasionally (after, of course, you have the cash to pay for the item IN FULL without a loan).  Boats, RVs, second homes...there are a lot of love-to-have items that in reality you may hardly ever use.  Renting these things is often a better idea.Get a grip on your shopping.  Buying stuff just because it is on sale can get you into debt.  Ditto for using credit cards to buy stuff that you can't afford.  Ditto for taking out a home equity loan to go on vacation or put in a hot tub when you don't have the money to pay for these items.  Retailers--both brick-and-mortar as well as online--have developed so many ways to separate you from your money so you really need to be on your guard when it comes to spending your hard-earned money."},

{"title": "FI/RE", "date": "Saturday, April 21, 2018", "text": "A popular topic on reddit and other websites is the concept of FI/RE (Financial Independence/Retire Early).  Basically you get a high paying job as soon as possible, save more than half your income, invest it, and have enough to fully retire on by your mid to late 30s (here's another overview).It's a great concept--although execution may be a bit difficult--but being able to retire when you want to, on your own terms, is an amazing goal.  I remember some years ago when Mr Money Mustache first become popular, he was one of the first people to preach the gospel of early retirement.  The idea has only grown and spread since then.  The media also loves to pick up on these stories both because being able to retire by 30 is so rare and because nearly everyone would love to do that (examples here, here, here, and here).I was able to do something similar (I am in no way financially independent as we rely on hubby's pension and social security plus my freelance work) when I stopped working at 43.  On the one hand it was wonderful to be free from the grind of a job, on the other hand I didn't realize how many hours there is to fill in a day when there is absolutely nothing you need to do!There are several downsides to retiring early, including social isolation (especially if you are 30 years old and everyone you know has a regular work schedule).  And boredom can become a huge factor (I was so bored I wrote a book then decided to keep working on a freelance basis in the field I used to work in).  Plus there is always the fear that your financial plans can somehow be torpedoed, whether by an unstable financial market or a pension suddenly just shutting off (!).I think everyone should aim for the basics of FI/RE which include becoming debt free, paying off your house, saving a lot of your income, living below your means, and investing your money.  Whether people actually quit working all together is a separate question.  Many people love their jobs, many people have no other way to fill all of the hours of their day and don't want to live like an elderly retiree when they are still quite young, and others may enjoy working and thus try out a bunch of different jobs which is easier to do--and to quit if you hate it--than if you depend on the job in question to eat and pay your bills.Now I am not so much into the early retirement part (I am really looking forward to working my annual six week job at the WSOP) as I am into the financially independent part (which I am working diligently on as I speak!)."},

{"title": "When It Rains, It Pours", "date": "Thursday, April 19, 2018", "text": "It's been an annoying few days here...First, the plumbing problem we thought we solved wasn't solved at all.  I thought the problem was the toilet wax ring so we paid a reasonable amount to have a guy come over and change that part out.  He noticed that the insides of the toilet were spraying water everywhere because of hard water build up so hubby and I replaced those parts.  A few days later I notice ANOTHER leak.  The only part that hadn't been changed was the gasket between the tank and the bowl so hubby and I got a new gasket set and changed that part out (there turned out to be a hole in the old gasket) and it STILL leaked.  When I Googled the brand of toilet, it noted that it needed the special gasket made only for that brand of toilet so off to the home improvement store we went today to get the right kind of gasket.  We just fixed it and hopefully (crossing my fingers) the leak problem is finally solved!Then a couple days ago we were awakened in the middle of the night with the loud chirping of the smoke detector in the upstairs hall.  We (both hubby and I took turns) hopped up on a ladder to reach the second story ceiling (yikes), replaced the battery in the smoke detector, and it STILL chirped.  So I Googled (I don't know what I would do without Google and YouTube) and it said that we had to reset the smoke detector (who knew?) and that seemed to solve the problem until a couple hours later when the incessant chirping started again.  Since the battery was old, we figured it might be dead-ish as well so we bought another battery today and (fingers crossed again) it hasn't chirped since.Then a few hours ago we were leaving the casino after hubby played poker and our (one and a half year old basically new) car was dead.  The key fob wouldn't unlock the door and when we got in the car (thank goodness there is still a key lock in the driver's side door), the car wouldn't start at all.  Thankfully it still has the three-year roadside assistance that comes with the new car so we called and waited a bit and a guy showed up and jumped the car.  He told us that car batteries usually only last about two years in Las Vegas due to the high heat but since the battery is covered by the car warranty I will be taking it to the dealership tomorrow to get a new battery.On the one hand, all of these annoyances took time away from other things we could be doing and they were pretty stressful when the simple fixes didn't work.  On the other hand, things could be worse.  At least hubby was with me (after his heart attack a month ago I really appreciate us both being able to solve these problems together), at least the fixes weren't expensive (a lady on the news recently got a $10,000 bill to fix a drain problem that happened in her yard so she is responsible for it yikes!), and with the internet and step-by-step instructions, we are able to fix these problems easily enough.  Needless to say, I will be getting AAA when the roadside assistance program expires!"},
{"title": "No Luck on the Moving Front Yet", "date": "Wednesday, April 18, 2018", "text": "We still haven't made any progress on the moving issue.  We looked at three towns which were an hour or two away from Las Vegas and all of those places were meh so those places are off the list.  The family wants us to move to Connecticut but it is still snowing there and it is almost MAY!!!  Plus property tax on a $275k-$300k house there is around $10k per year.  Hubby's answer to moving to Connecticut is \"No Way\".  One sister wants us to move back to Seattle.  Home prices have increased exponentially there since we moved from there about seven years ago and the traffic in Seattle when we were there last year was crazy bad.  So that's a no. A daughter wants us to move to Florida.  That may have been an option until she was Facetiming with us and we watched a snake slither into her house.  She screamed, hubby screamed, then we watched as she got a broom and somehow got the snake out of her house.  Hubby hates snakes.  I think he is still traumatized by that so Florida is a definitive no.One of the boys will be retiring from the military soon and they are deciding between staying in Tennessee and moving to North Carolina.  Both of these places, along with Georgia where we lived for about six months before moving to Las Vegas, are options.  We love the weather there, home prices are cheap, property taxes are reasonable, and there are military bases and military medical services in the all of these places.  The only thing we don't like is that there are no casinos in any of these states (hubby loves to play poker) and all of these places have tornadoes (so many tornadoes in these areas!  eekkk).So we are still discussing and debating and looking at all options (even Oklahoma came up on the list as they have lots of casinos and cheap new houses...but again, so many tornadoes!).  The search continues..."},

{"title": "Scams", "date": "Monday, April 16, 2018", "text": "There are so many ways to separate you from your money.  There are legitimate things like a great sale or a bunch of advertising that makes you want to buy something that you may or may not need, then there are scammy things with the sole purpose of taking your money and leaving you with nothing.  There are so many scams that I could write an entire book about them, but I will use the email in the photo above as an example of one type of scam.  This email arrived yesterday and I had to laugh when I read it because it was so poorly written.  So I Googled the email associated with the email and found that it is a common phishing scam. Any time I get an email that I am not expecting I am always suspicious.  For any email that asks me to send money or confirm my information, I simply ignore the email and log into my real account and see what's going on that way (some websites do need me to update my info occasionally, if that's the case it will tell me that when I log into my account instead of emailing me for the info).  If I still have questions I will contact the customer service number for the actual company (using the number found on the company website, not one offered in the possible scam email).In another incident a few months ago, a lady called and said I have a warrant out for my arrest and unless I paid with a credit card over the phone right now, the police would be sent to my house to arrest me immediately.  I had to laugh at that one too because I knew it was fake but I understand how her aggressive tone and threatening manner could have scared some innocent person into complying with her request for payment.  I asked her for the court the warrant was issued out of and the warrant number and she slammed the phone down in my ear.  There is seemingly no end to the ways that people can think of to rip other people off.  Anyway, just a short note to beware of all of the scammers out there..."},

{"title": "20 Tech Tips", "date": "Saturday, April 14, 2018", "text": "I was inspired by a post over on reddit about cheap options for websites so today's post will be all about cheap tech options...This is the reddit post about using GitHub for hosting free static websites.  I have never used this service but some people love it.  It does look a bit technical for beginners though.I buy all of my domain names through NameCheap.  It's simple, cheap, and better than buying the names through your hosting service IMHO.I host all of my websites at InMotion.  I use the bulk hosting plan so it is a flat rate no matter how many websites I host and how much bandwidth they use.I use WordPress for designing my websites.  It is simple and best of all free to use and has oodles of free templates which are simple enough to tweek.  Plus I remember the days of expensive web design software such as DreamWeaver and am super happy this free design option is available.Some people use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting their websites.  I have never used it but it is yet another option.If you often connect through the internet through public wifi consider getting a VPN service (that you pay for, not the free ones).Reddit also has regular posts about the best free websites.  Here's an example.If you work for an non profit, you/your organization can save lots of money on great software (MS Office Pro, Adobe Suite, etc) through TechSoup.My favorite tablet is the Samsung Galaxy S2 8\" tablet (model T713).  I had the older version of this tablet (model T710) but wasn't happy with the battery life, then I bought the newest version, the Tab S3, but I didn't think it was much faster and it only came in the larger 10\" size which was too big so I bought the 8\" T713 version of the S2 and am totally happy with it.I love my Dell XPS 13\" laptop.  It is small enough to carry with me everywhere but big enough to use at home for general computer stuff (mostly writing and editing documents).  While I have the older version (i5, 4g, 128g HD), the newer i7 version is on my shopping list.My cell phone is the Galaxy S8 Plus.  I love this phone, it takes excellent photos, and the browser is super speedy.  Of course I bought it half off on sale through the Samsung website.Speaking of cell phones, mine can probably do hundreds of things I don't even know it can do but whenever I get a new phone I Google for tips for the specific model of phone in case there are useful things I should know about like this.Privacy has been in the news a lot lately.  The bottom line is that people should expect that they have absolutely no privacy when it comes to anything they do online.  On the other hand, here are some random tech privacy tips.Should you delete your Facebook account?  After the big kerfuffle over how much data they keep on their users, many people have decided to delete the service all together.  So far I have only taken the app off my phone and tablet and I have not posted anything other than to my walk group page since the first of the year.  I'm still deciding if I should delete Facebook all together.One thing hubby and I use a lot is the bluetooth connection from our phones to our car.  This allows for hands-free calling and talking while we are driving down the road and it is really convenient (not to mention safer).While I don't use my printer nearly as much as I used to, I still end up printing things out occasionally (people's boarding passes, tickets, etc) so being able to send everything to my printer wirelessly is a great help.  I can also send stuff from my phone or tablet to be printed.I do nearly everything from my cell/tablet, from ordering an Uber to depositing checks to checking out library e books to my Kindle to writing up documents in a pinch.  Needless to say I use a lot of different apps.  I also check every once in a while to see what others consider great apps by checking out articles like this.Speaking of apps, I came across this article about apps that can earn you money.  I haven't actually tried any of these yet but it is on my \"to do\" list, just to see if they are legit or not.I love news aggregator websites.  There is so much happening every minute of the day that it would be virtually impossible to keep up with everything without it being put together for me in an easy to read format.  My favorites are Popurls, MetaFilter, and of course Reddit.Kevin Kelly has always been a cool tech icon.  I particularly like the \"cool tools\" section of his website."},

{"title": "The $20 Weekly Food Budget", "date": "Tuesday, April 10, 2018", "text": "I came across this article today about buying a week's worth of groceries for only $20 if you are broke and have very little to spend on food.  While the lady's list will ensure you don't starve, I wouldn't recommend eating the stuff on her list long term as it seems to be heavy on processed food and light on vegetables.But, using her $20 per week budget for one person, multiplying it by two people ($40 per week), times four weeks in a month ($160) I think people could actually eat pretty well on such an amount.Our local 99 Cent Store provides a wide array of fresh produce ($1 for six to eight tomatoes, $1 pineapple, $1 bag of onions, etc) and lots of other food items (pound of beans/lentils, etc) all for very cheap.  Add in some bulk items from Costco (25 lbs of flour for $9, 10 lbs oatmeal for $10) and loss leaders from the local grocery store and the hubby and I could eat very well for $160 a month!If we had a very limited food budget I would:Buy produce in season.  Bananas are always cheap while strawberries, apples, and watermelon are quiet inexpensive in season.  For $20 at the 99 Cent Store we would have a month's worth of fresh vegetables (5 lbs potatoes, big squash, tomatoes, onions, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, cauliflower, etc).Use beans, rice, pasta, and/or lentils in at least a couple meals each day.  These items cost around $1 per pound or less and there are an infinite number of ways to use them in tasty recipes featured on the internet.Cook from scratch as much as possible.  Bread is super cheap to make when you buy the ingredients (flour, sugar, oil, yeast, salt) in bulk.  Oatmeal makes a great breakfast on its own or can be dressed up as granola, cookies, and other desserts (you can even make oatmilk out of it!).Spices can be found cheaply (at Costco in bulk, at Asian or Mexican stores, and at the $1 store) and can mean the difference between bland and very tasty food.I always buy canned tomatoes on sale (sometimes 2 cans for $1, sometimes .69 cents per can) and these can be the base for all kinds of things from homemade pasta sauce to soups and stews.We don't eat much meat or dairy at all so instead of spending big on these items we would use our money to buy peanut butter, nuts, maybe a couple cans of tuna and mayo and the ingredients for hummus (chickpeas and hummus).My splurges would be on almond milk, maybe a dozen eggs which would last us an entire month, honey (I prefer it to sugar), and add ons for smoothies (chia seeds, flax seeds), and of course a bit of chocolate!Note, if you are 100% vegan you should probably buy a bottle of B12 vitamins which vegan foods lack.While you can't do much about most of your monthly bills (mortgage payment, electric bill), your food budget can really be stretched with a bit of imagination, some resourceful shopping, and great ideas from the internet!"},
{"title": "Downsizing...Or Upsizing?", "date": "Monday, April 9, 2018", "text": "I came across this article today about people downsizing their homes as they age.  We did this when we moved from Seattle.  We wanted a smaller house and a smaller yard so that we would have more time to spend on life and need less time to spend on home maintenance and upkeep.Fast forward to living in Las Vegas where after we downsized we now think we should have upsized a bit due to how many of our friends and family come to the vacation destination we live in to both see us and see all of the tourist attractions here!  As we look for another place to live, the question to upsize or downsize is one of our considerations.  Among the things we are thinking about:Cost.  Due to the booming housing market here we have a significant amount of equity in our current home.  If we sell then move to an area with much cheaper housing we would be able to pay cash for a new house.  That would be awesome, budget-wise.  On the other hand, if we want to stay in the general Las Vegas area, that big piece of equity would not make such a huge difference because of the high house prices here.Property taxes.  We love the property tax situation in Nevada (low) so moving elsewhere in Nevada--or several other states we are considering--would be good.  Many places also offer property tax rebates for both seniors and veterans which we qualify for.  Other states we have looked at, however, have really high property taxes and no rebates which would definitely put a crimp in our budget.Size of home.  We know now that living in a popular tourist destination means a bigger home is more comfortable for large groups of visitors.  I also like more space--although it isn't REALLY necessary but nice to have--in order to do more things in the space (like have an exercise room, an office, etc).  This is kind of a conundrum, however, since a more spacious house is nice to have, but on the flip side, everything from utilities to maintenance costs more (new flooring, for example, is much cheaper for a 1500 square foot house than a 3000 square foot house; and it's cheaper to air condition a small house than a large house).Cost of living.  Each place we have looked at has a variety of cost-of-living factors to consider.  The area we are looking at in Tennessee has cheap FIBER internet (wow!), another place has very expensive utilities (gas, electricity, water), in another places all of the houses are on well and septic tanks (very cheap until one of these systems fail then very expensive). So in addition to deciding where to move geographically, we are also looking at a range of other factors about the specific kind of house to move to.  It's a work in progress..."},
{"title": "10 Things I LOVE About Beans and Legumes", "date": "Sunday, April 8, 2018", "text": "My pantry is stuffed with a variety of beans and legumes.  I love them!!!  Here's why:They are cheap!  I can get a pound of beans/lentils/peas/etc at the Dollar Store for, well, $1.  At Costco I can buy these in bulk even cheaper.They expand when you cook them.  They don't take up much space in the pantry but when you cook them they can double in size.They are healthy.  Beans and legumes are nutritious and full of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.They are versatile.  I often use beans and legumes in place of meat in my cooking.  I replace meat in burritos and tacos with black beans or pinto beans.  I replace hamburger in sloppy joes with lentils.  I make all kinds of soups and stews using beans or legumes instead of meat.They taste good.  No they don't actually taste like meat (much to hubby's disappointment when he tried a back bean burger) but they have their own taste which is pretty good IMHO.They feature prominently in the cuisines of many cultures.  I make Indian (dal), Mexican (chili), Italian (soups), Mediterranean (hummus), and Japanese (red bean buns) dishes to make our meals more interesting and tasty.They can be simple to cook.  Dried beans can take a bit more effort (soak over night then boil) but canned beans are super simple (open can, drain, then eat) and lentils cook pretty quickly.The can have a variety of textures.  They can be smooth and creamy (blended chickpeas in hummus), crunchy (baked chickpeas), chewy (beans in soups), etc.They can be served as every part of a meal.  They can be appetizers (falafel), the salad course (beans added to salads) the soup course (bean or legume soup), the main course (bean casserole) and even the dessert course (sweet bean buns).They can last a long time.  Canned beans can last for years, dried beans can last even longer."},
{"title": "Two Steps Forward, One Step Back", "date": "Saturday, April 7, 2018", "text": "I was reading this post over at Out My Window about financial set backs and making strides to move forward financially only to find yourself moving backwards occasionally.  I think that happens to everyone.  It seemed like when we first started getting out of debt using Dave Ramsey's system (ie: save $1000 for a mini emergency fund then do the debt snowball on your bills) that our emergency fund was being raided for literal emergencies on a regular basis.  On the one hand, it's depressing to feel like we were never getting ahead, on the other hand, at least we had an emergency fund to use instead of going deeper in debt using credit to cover a crisis.We are still in the same situation although since we have got rid of most of our debt and do keep adding to savings each month, each small financial crisis doesn't have us wanting to throw up our hands in defeat and go back to digging ourselves into more debt.In the past few months we have had several \"crisis\" that required a financial fix.  One daughter's half brother died unexpectedly so everyone pitched in to help cover the cost of a cremation and funeral ($500), hubby had a heart attack and I was running back and forth from the hospital to home and back each day--about an hour each way (an extra $150 in gas), one of the grandkids, his wife, and infant daughter decided to throw everything they owned in their barely running car and move across country, they were flat broke when they got to our house so we helped them out a little ($500), we got a surprise letter from the HOA saying we needed to paint all of the fascia around our house and had four weeks to do it in ($350) and now that I look at the house we decided we need to paint all of the window trim to match because it looks really bad not matching (that will be another $300...who knew painting stucco cost much more than regular house siding?), then we decided to get all three toilets fixed as one seemed to be starting to leak around the wax ring ($150), then immediately needed to repair the insides of the toilets as well ($25 for parts)...the list of emergencies seem never ending!However all of these financial set backs seem to have a silver lining.  It's horrible that the daughter's half brother died so unexpectedly but it was good to see the entire family (and hubby has A LOT of family) come together to help out.  It's horrible that hubby had a heart attack but it was a simple fix (relatively speaking, angioplasty and stents are a simpler fix than open heart surgery) and insurance covered every dime of the costs.  We were super worried about the grandson's plan (or apparent lack thereof) but they are now settled on the opposite coast and had a travel experience they will remember forever (oh to be young carefree).  I was annoyed to get a letter from the KGB...uh, HOA, but the new paint does make the house look better, it's better to keep up on home maintenance instead of letting the wood get more and more weathered, and the fresh look may make the house sell faster when we decide to move.  And finally, the toilets definitely needed to be done and the plumber guy said that if we hadn't caught the minor leak now the one toilet would have eventually rotted through the floor!So we continue moving forward as best we can, being frugal where possible, covering financial disasters but looking for the silver lining, and enjoying life no matter what it throws at us!"},
{"title": "Toilet Fix Part #2", "date": "Friday, April 6, 2018", "text": "So after the guy got done with the toilet wax ring install yesterday (basically pick up the toilet and take the old wax ring off then replace it with a new wax ring, reset the toilet over the drain, then screw it back into the flange x 3), the installer told me the innards of the toilets should be replaced as well (the really hard water in our area makes the plastic parts inside the toilet get crunchy after a while, and these parts have been in the toilets for years).  This part we could do, so hubby an I ran to the hardware store and bought three sets of toilet innards (flapper and flush assembly set for $10 each), then set to work fixing the toilets.  After watching a couple YouTube videos, reading the instructions (who knew the flush assembly had changed so much over the years, there isn't even a floaty ball part anymore!), and having a minor water mess (put a BIG bowl under the flush assembly!), we easily replaced the innards of all three toilets thus saving a bit of extra money over having the job done by someone else.  These days if the work is heavy (like lifting an entire toilet) or dangerous (climbing up the the second story roof) we hire it done.  Simple jobs, however, we are still happy to do ourselves!"},
{"title": "Paying for Home Repairs", "date": "Thursday, April 5, 2018", "text": "This morning we had a guy come over to replace all of the wax rings around the toilets in our house as they have probably been there since the house was built and one toilet was feeling a bit unstable so it was time to get this done.  Now any other time, the hubby and I would have just done the work ourselves but we are getting old, hubby has a bad back, and with his recent heart surgery, any heavy work is a definite no way (on my part, his doctor says he is fine now but still).  So instead of the job costing $10 for us to do it ourselves, we are paying $40 per toilet (x 3) to have a professional do it.  The price is not bad as one plumber said it would cost $200 per toilet (??!!!) so finding someone to do the job for a total of $120 is definitely a good deal but this is just one more thing that you have to account for as you age--needing to pay people to do things that in your younger days you would have just done yourself!"},

{"title": "A Happy Medical Update", "date": "Friday, March 30, 2018", "text": "Hubby is feeling much better after his recent heart attack.  He has also gone all in on improving his health through a much better diet than he used to have (basically meat and rice for every meal in addition to copious restaurant food).  When he was in the hospital, each meal would be a trough of unhealthy food (such as a big slab of meat loaf and mashed potatoes swimming in gravy) and then they would test his blood sugar and say something like \"wow your blood sugar is pretty high!\" followed by a shot of insulin After. Every. Meal.  Really?  They didn't think his high blood sugar had anything to do with the crappy food they were giving him??Over the past two weeks we have been eating mostly whole food, plant based vegan meals with the occasional piece of fish and we have watched both his blood pressure and blood sugar drop like a rock.  He has a home blood pressure monitor and a home blood sugar monitor kit so he tests these things daily and it is so exciting to see his health metrics improving on a daily basis!  We are going to check with his doctor in a week and see about getting his meds lowered (if you are on meds to lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol and then significantly change your diet you have to be careful about these things going TOO low).And even though all of his medical care and medications are free (yeah military service), it made me think about the people we see on the news who pay sky high prices for their prescription medications for chronic health conditions and have to choose between paying for heat and paying for medication.  I think if more people knew that a lot of medical conditions (not all by any means but many) could be treated, or even completely reversed, by changing their diet and walking around the block a couple times a day, the world would be much better off. Here are the things that influenced me to start us on a healthier way of eating:The movie 'Forks Over Knives'The book 'The End of Diabetes'Dr FuhrmanDr GregorDr McDougallThe movie 'Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead' Parts 1 and 2The movie 'Fed Up'The movie 'Hungry for Change'The movie 'What the Health'The book 'The China Study'The book 'How Not to Die'The book 'Eat to Live'"},
{"title": "HOA Hell", "date": "Thursday, March 29, 2018", "text": "I've never lived in a home in an HOA (development with a Home Owner's Association) until we moved to Las Vegas.  Needless to say it will never happen again.  Nearly all homes in Las Vegas are part of an HOA and the news regularly covers HOA horror stories (examples here and here).  We sometimes get notices from our HOA saying \"there are five weed in your yard please remove them or you will be fined\".  And in our friend's HOA, they get notices any time there are black marks from tires in people's driveways which means the homeowner somehow needs to clean rubber marks off of their concrete driveway (?!?). A few days ago I got a notice from our HOA which I figured would have something to do with the weeds that just popped up during our recent warm weather but no, it was a notice to paint all of the fascia and trim around our house because it looks faded.  We have 25 days to comply and when I got the first estimate to do the painting it was $1000!!!  I would have done the painting myself but we have a two story house and both hubby and I are in the \"prone to falls\" age group and the last thing I want to do is roll off the roof so I asked some friends for recommendations and found a guy who will do the painting for $350 which is a lot less than the original estimate but for people who live on a fixed income and don't have any savings something like this could be a major financial disaster for them.I guess the take away from this is to not live in an HOA (we are planning to move), to have money in savings (we do), and if you are a homeowner, be prepared for unexpected expenses to pop up."},

{"title": "Vegan Food Update", "date": "Thursday, March 22, 2018", "text": "We have been mostly vegan for the past week.  Yesterday we hit up Costco, Whole Foods, and a couple other grocery stores so I could expand my vegan repertoire.  Hubby commented that eating this way was pretty expensive but I think he didn't take into account that we haven't eaten out in a week, that we are just getting started eating this way so we are making additional purchases of spices and things like wild rice that we don't usually buy, and that we are still deciding what foods we like to eat.Yesterday we tried vegan \"hamburgers\" made out of mushrooms and other vegetables and hubby said that it tasted like compressed grass so that won't be something we purchase again (we might try a different brand if I hear of something more hamburger-ish).  Today I made vegan chili and hubby added some vegan sausage to his bowl which he actually liked.  Other foods we like: Dave's Killer bread, homemade lentil and black bean soup, black bean tacos with guacamole, hummus and vegies wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla, and whole wheat pasta in homemade pasta sauce.  We also eat a lot of fruit and nuts for snacks and desserts as well as salads which tend to go with everything.  Stuff that wasn't such a hit: steel cut oatmeal (takes a long time to cook and we like old fashioned oats better), a cheaper \"whole grain\" bread which didn't seem very grainy when we ate it, and wild rice which I think I overcooked with too much water so I will need to practice making this.Overall I think we are making good strides with our new way of eating (or it could have been hubby's cardiologist's pep talk of \"change your diet or you will die\" which inspired him).  Either way, for someone who has been eating mostly meat and rice for 69 years, hubby is really making an effort to eat the vegan things I make and I am making an effort to be more creative with every meal I cook!"},
{"title": "20 Money Saving Skills to Learn", "date": "Wednesday, March 21, 2018", "text": "We save a lot of money around our house simply because we have learned to do a lot of things that require some level of skill ourselves.  Here are some money-saving skills to learn:How to cut hair (hubby cuts my hair all the time and does a great job of it!).How to cook (especially now that we are pretty much vegan, we now eat nearly every meal at home).How to do minor plumbing fixes (fixing toilet leaks, replacing faucets or just washers, replacing toilet wax rings, etc can save A LOT of money over the cost of a plumber).How to do basic landscaping (we have some simple tools and do our own landscaping now like trimming shrubs and trimming dead palm tree palms).How to do basic appliance repair (with YouTube videos we have fixed our microwave, refrigerator, and dryer).How to sew (mostly my needle and thread skills go towards hemming pants and making quick clothing repairs).How to fix tech issues (again, with the internet, I've been able to troubleshoot computer, cell phone, and modem problems with ease).How to do home improvement tasks (things like painting, wall papering, fixing holes in the wall, etc. are pretty simple to learn).How to fix locks (both changing out locks and DIYing the replacements for our vehicle's transponders keys has saved us a lot of money over the years).How to follow instructions and put things together (Ikea furniture and many other things come with instructions on how to put items together yourself which is cheaper than hiring out such tasks).How to do your own personal maintenance (mani/pedi, waxing, etc. can all be learned and improved with practice and save you a lot of money over the years).How to groom your pet (many people learn how to do everything for their pets from haircuts to nail clipping).How to garden (raising your own food can save A LOT of money).How to do basic auto repairs and maintenance (it's easy enough to jump a dead battery or change a flat tire instead of calling a tow truck; it is also easy enough to do things like refilling fluids, changing windshield wipers, etc.  We don't change our own oil because it is usually cheaper to have our local shop do it).How to provide basic medical care (taking care of minor wounds, treating minor illnesses, etc. can often be done at home instead of hitting up the doctor's office).How to do your own travel planning (I was surprised to hear some people still use travel agents because it is really pretty easy to book your own flights/hotels/cruises/tours/etc. online yourself).How to travel with one bag (with some study and practice we can now easily travel with only a carry on which saves a lot of money in baggage fees).How to organize your things (our fridge, pantry, supplies closet, even the junk drawer are pretty meticulously organized, this keeps us from buying duplicate items because we can't find things and also ensures we don't waste food because it was 'out of sight, out of mind').Canning and preserving food (my main skill in this area is freezing things but my grandmother could can, pickle, smoke, dry, freeze, make jam...basically any kind of food preservation skill you can think of and it saved her a lot of money since they grew a huge garden and didn't want it to go to waste).How to do crafty things (again, my skills in this area are sadly lacking but I have a lot of friends who can knit, quilt, sew, paint, etc. and this can save them a lot of money on both gifts to give and cool things for their home)."},

{"title": "Going Vegan", "date": "Sunday, March 18, 2018", "text": "After hubby's recent heart attack, we have gone pretty much vegan.  I've tried to be whole-food-plant-based vegan before but it was really hard when hubby and all of our friends would want to go out to eat or cook meals for get togethers that were mostly meat and rice (ie: Filipino food).  Now that hubby has had a brush with death, however, he is fully on the vegan train with me and it has been working out really well for the past few days.Basically I have been finding simple, tasty vegan/plant-based recipes online that are similar enough to what he is used to eating so the food isn't too weird.  It is wonderful to have the internet and a whole world of online vegans at my fingertips who share information and recipes and often success stories about how eating this new way has changed their life.  We are also fortunate in this day and age that nutritious, vegan food can be found at most grocery stores.  Best of all, it seems like buying plants/whole grains/spices is much less expensive than our usual grocery store purchases of meat and dairy and processed food!Most importantly so far, we have seen hubby's blood sugar and blood pressure fall from what it is normally (normally being really high even with medication).  According to many of the success stories of whole-food-plant-based vegans, it is possible to get completely off of medications for high cholesterol, high blood pressure. and diabetes (examples here, here, and here) which would be absolutely amazing!"},

{"title": "How Much Does $100 Really Get You?", "date": "Monday, March 12, 2018", "text": "I came across this cool infographic which shows how far your $100 will take you in regards to rent and goods in each state.  This is kind of useful as we are still talking about moving only we don't know where to move to.  With us being on a fixed income the data makes the costs even more clear (for people who plan to work where they move to, as the article points out, they may make more money in a higher cost of living area).When looking at various places we might want to live, there are several things we are considering including cost of housing, cost of taxes, overall tax burden, weather, crime rates, community amenities, gun laws, nearness to family, distance to an airport, distance to military services, internet availability, cost of utilities, nearness to casinos, traffic, the general \"vibe\" of the people in the community, the library system, a smaller town but near enough to a large city, and the general cost of living.It's really hard to find a place that meets all of these criteria!  Based on the infographic, Hawaii, DC, and California are a definite no.  Delaware through Maryland don't look very promising either.  On the flip side, the deep south looks pretty inexpensive but the heat, humidity, and bugs (plus the fact that his daughter was Facetiming us from her home in Florida when a big snake slithered through the open door and hubby squealed like a girl when he saw that--he is NOT a snake fan) makes that area a 'probably not'.  So I will keep researching and haunting Zillow and maybe one of these days we will pull up stakes and move!"},

{"title": "Retail-pocalypse", "date": "Friday, March 9, 2018", "text": "Retail stores sure have changed a lot in the last few decades.  Years ago if you wanted to buy meat you went to a butcher shop, if you wanted a dress you went to a dress shop, and if you wanted shoes you went to a shoe store.  Then big department stores consolidated all of these individual stores into one big store where you could buy everything you needed at one place.  Then came malls where separate retail stores were consolidated into one gigantic space that also featured food courts, movie theaters, and other entertainment spaces.I grew up in the age of malls where people would \"hang out\", meet up with friends, buy a snack, maybe go to a movie, then buy stuff that we either saw in store windows or were popular with the fashionable people.  I bought my first pair of name-brand jeans at a mall (San Francisco Riding Gear), and up until seven or eight years ago, I would \"shop til I dropped\" at malls buying all kinds of name-brand items (Coach purses, North Face jackets, etc) from major mall stores (Macys, Saks, etc).Now we are in the midst of another shopping revolution, namely the online shopping revolution.  With so many people shopping online, brick and mortar stores are going the way of the corner butcher shop (ie: they are closing up at a rapid pace).  This is a sad state of affairs for those of us who remember the good old days of shopping but it is also a sign of the times.  Back in the day you had a store or two where you could compare prices and buy the item you wanted from the lowest price store.  These days you have thousands of stores selling the item you want and you can compare prices from the comfort of your home computer. I know my shopping has certainly changed over the years.  We used to shop for fun, buying stuff that we saw that we liked or buying name brand items to keep up with our peers so we wouldn't look like we shopped at the Goodwill (this was a BAD things years ago since it made you look poor, these days I only shop at the Goodwill...how times have changed!).  Now when I go to a store I have a list of things that I want to buy that are really needed, I am no longer trying to \"keep up with the Joneses\", and I will compare prices obsessively online before I buy anything so I know I am getting the best deal.  I prefer shopping online if it saves me a lot of money (like when I need a cell phone case which costs $30 at a local retailer but which I can find online for around $10) and I also like the idea of not having to go to stores unless I really really need something; I'm just not much into shopping like I used to be.So RIP brick and mortar stores.  Im sure in the far distant future we won't even need to shop--we will be able to 3D print the things we want and need in the comfort of our own home.  It's crazy how fast things are changing these days!"},
{"title": "Another Financial Crisis on the Horizon?", "date": "Thursday, March 8, 2018", "text": "According to Bill Gates, he is certain that another financial crisis is on the horizon (although he doesn't know when it will happen).  Two things struck me about this, the first that, duh, our economy is cyclical and there are always ups and downs so it shouldn't surprise anyone that in 2008 there were bad financial times then things got better and then things could conceivably get worse.  The second thing he said is \"fortunately we got through that one reasonably well.\"  Uh, he might have got through it reasonably well but there were a lot of people who lost jobs, lost houses, and it totally turned their lives upside down.No matter when a financial crisis is set to happen, EVERYONE needs to prepare like it will hit tomorrow.  And everyone needs to prepare like it will be ten times worse than 2008.  It seems like the people worst off during the last recession were middle to high income folks whose jobs were extraneous, whose companies were extraneous, and who were in debt (lots of credit card debt, house mortgaged to the hilt, car debt, etc).  In other words, these people were living on the financial edge and it took very little to push them over the edge into bankruptcy and poverty. Here's where to start:Get out of debt ASAP.  Dave Ramsey is very good for this.  I listened to his radio show practically until my ears bled and I could hear his answers to people's financial questions in my sleep and that finally gave me the incentive to get out of debt.Make paying off your house a goal.  Can you image how financially set you would be if you had NO mortgage payment, no car payment, no debt payments at all?  It is definitely easier to weather a financial storm when you only have to earn enough to pay utilities, property tax, food, and gas.On the flip side, don't take money out of your house even if you are receiving enough refi offers to wallpaper a room.  We have a lot of equity in our house and every day when I check the mail I am getting flyers to refinance my house.  These companies think I want to put my home in jeopardy and risk being homeless so I can go on a vacation or use the equity to buy a new car???Have multiple streams of income.  If you have all of your eggs in one (job) basket, then when that job goes away so does all of your income.  If you have money coming in from a half dozen sources, it makes it much easier to weather a financial storm if one job or source of income goes away.Always keep improving your skills.  Watch what is happening on the horizon and match your skill set with what will be needed in 10 years, not what was needed 10 years in the past.  There are some skills that are kind of future proof (like nurses and plumbers) and there are some skills that really aren't needed anymore (secretarial pool skills).  Then there are the jobs that are on the fast track to elimination (like store cashiers, commercial drivers, etc).Have good interpersonal skills and social relationships.  It's always easier to weather a financial disaster when you have other people to lean on and help you out.  Of course, offer to help out others when they are in need as well.Stockpile!  You don't need 10 years worth of food and supplies but having enough on hand so you aren't like one of the people on the news grabbing the last loaf of bread in a store when a storm is set to hit is a good idea.  Likewise, if you have enough of the necessities stockpiled (food, water, toilet paper, medicine, household supplies etc) you can weather anything from a lengthy illness to a job layoff, with little financial effort.Control your spending and live below your means.  During the last recession I saw plenty of people go from high earners to can't find a job.  Some continued to buy their Coach purses and Jimmy Choo shoes until their credit cards were declined even though they KNEW they didn't have any income coming in.  If you can control your spending and live below your means now when times are good, you will be well set to weather another financial disaster.Don't be afraid to take big, decisive actions.  In 2010 my biggest client was involved in a huge financial mess.  Rather than try to replace that client or hang around and try to get some scraps from what was left of the organization I had worked for for 10 years, I told hubby we should sell the house and everything in it and travel for a while with only what we could carry in our backpacks.  At the same time our house was losing value daily and the recession was in full swing so the financial future didn't look good for anyone at that point.  Surprisingly (really really surprisingly) hubby said yes.  He NEVER likes change so I have no idea what inspired him to agree with me.  We sold our house when it still had some equity in it, got completely out of debt, put a few things in storage, and hit the road to travel for a while.  That plan turned out really well for us.  Eventually we resettled in a new city and were able to remain debt free (until I bought a car and used my credit cards and now...I'm working on paying off debt again).Be proactive.  It's easy to stick with the status quo and hope for the best but that doesn't help you when you know a major financial crisis is looming (like a new baby coming in eight months, a possible divorce on the horizon, an employer that looks like they will be bankrupt sooner rather than later).  Many people freeze in these circumstances and hope things will blow over or that things will somehow work out but when you know something bad is coming, take proactive action--polish up your resume, start networking, find a better job, sell stuff you don't need and bank the money, etc.Hopefully the next financial crisis won't be so bad but one never knows so prepare now for whatever may happen."},
{"title": "Maybe I Need an Allowance?", "date": "Wednesday, March 7, 2018", "text": "I saw this article today about each partner in a relationship having an allowance that they can spend as they want without question by the other partner.  I guess it makes sense for most people.  With the hubby and I, our finances are a bit different. When we got together 30+ years ago, we purposely kept all of our finances separate (I was 20 with student loans, a new car and payment, I had just bought a house, and had no desire for anyone to tell me how to spend my money; hubby was 40 with 5 kids and alimony and had always been the breadwinner/money spender with no desire to hand over financial control in the relationship).  Fast forward to today and our finances are still separate (separate credit cards and bank accounts; we are both on the mortgage and the car loan due to tax purposes).  Oddly enough we have never had an argument about money.Although relationship \"experts\" say finances should be merged when you get married, I think each couple needs to work out what works best for them.  For us, our \"system\", such as it is, works best for us.  We each pay half the bills (hubby pays more of the bills now, I paid more when I was working and earning a lot; it's kind of based on income), we each spend (within our means) on whatever we want, and our joint goal is to remain debt free (yes, I feel bad about running up a credit card and am working to pay it off ASAP). Being debt free and having money in savings is the best thing we can do for each other.  Should one of us die before the other, the other person won't be left with a lot of debt to pay off (I've seen this happen to couples way too often, up to and including the spouse who was left behind finding out they were bankrupt after their spouse who had been juggling all of the finances dies, that was really sad to see happen).  Being debt free also means that we aren't tied to jobs and (more importantly) hubby isn't having to work at 70 years old (I've also seen people who should be fully retired unable to quit working due to debt).So while I probably don't need an allowance due to the way we handle our money, this is definitely the way to go for couples who have merged their spending so money doesn't become a big issue in the relationship.  Hopefully couples will each respect the other enough (or at least care what would happen to the other should tragedy strike) that they make it a goal to become debt free and stay that way as well as have a comfortable cushion of savings.  On a side note, for couples who need to learn to work together to get out of debt, Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University seems to work wonders at this."},

{"title": "10 (Free) Ways to Get Healthy", "date": "Monday, March 5, 2018", "text": "People are so scarily unhealthy these days.  While so many people are protesting about guns and mass shootings (which are horrible events but the number of people killed in mass shootings is in the triple digits each year), you don't hear a peep from anyone about the more than a million people who die each year from lifestyle diseases (heart attack, stroke, diabetics, etc).  Based on this list from the CDC on cause of death, people need to worry less about guns and more about what they eat and how much they exercise and a dozen other things that impact their health.  I mean, if a million people a year were dropping out of the sky on airplanes, airplanes would be banned but I guess people's general health is not something that gets very much publicity even though the numbers have reached crisis proportions. More than 70% of Americans are overweight or obese, and don't even get me started on the part about the government subsidizing the very food that makes people sick while at the same time taking millions of dollars from big pharma lobbyists.  Ugh.  The bottom line is that you are responsible for your own health.  No one will legislate healthy food, your doctor will happily write you a prescription for your diabetes but provide no help to cure it, and then when you succumb to disease you (or your family) will be stuck with the giant medical bills to try to extend your life a bit.  This sort of stuff makes me livid with the system we have ended up with.Here are 10 ways to improve your health...for free!Walk every day.  Hopefully several times per day in a rapid manner that gets your heart rate up.Choose better food.  Whole food plant based diets seem to be popular now and have the studies to back up how healthy this way of eating is for your body.  If you are going to buy food anyway, you might as well buy the most nutritious food possible.  Since we have gone mostly vegan, the amount we spend on food each month has actually gone down.Stretch and move around every hour.  This is simple to do where ever you are--at home, at work--and doesn't take any special equipment.Switch out all of your beverages for water.  This saves on calories big time and drinking water instead of soda will save you money.Look for community health freebies.  In our city we have free health fairs, free blood pressure checks, free radon detector kits, even free women's health services like pap tests and mammograms for women who can't afford them.Use online freebies to get healthier.  There are a lot of free apps--from MapMyRun to MyFitnessPal and a bajillion others--to help you improve your health, you can follow along with free Zumba and other fitness videos online, and there are numerous health bulletin boards where you can share information and ask questions about improving your health.Take advantage of any health deals your employer offers.  Some companies offer free gym memberships, a friend of mine was given a pedometer from her employer who pays employees for the number of steps they take each day, and other employers give extra bonuses to employees who don't smoke.Take care of your mental health as well.  There is a free National Suicide Hotline for people thinking about taking their own life and there are free support groups for nearly everyone (alcoholics, shop-a-holics, recently divorced, etc).Make time to sleep.  I know people brag about being able to function on four or five hours of sleep per night but most people need more sleep than that.  Schedule your sleep times just as you would scheduled any other important event.Find free things that make you happy then go do them.  Whether it is reading or listening to music or playing with the grandkids or volunteering, there are so many free things you can do that will make you relaxed and happy."},
{"title": "Free Stuff to Do", "date": "Sunday, March 4, 2018", "text": "Today we visited the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden.  We are working our way through the Las Vegas list I put up last month and have already done more than a dozen activities.  Since there are literally a thousand things on the list, and since I am trying to do a no-spend year, we are pretty much hitting up as many free activities as possible and in Las Vegas there are hundreds of free things to do so we should be set for a while.  I think many cities are similar--lots of free things to do but you have to look for them because the highly advertised things need to make money (at least to pay for the advertising!).Next time you go on vacation (or even in your own city) make a list of activities that are free or really cheap so you will have some activities to choose from that won't break the bank.  For example, the Lincoln Park Zoo is Chicago is wonderful--and free!  All of the Smithsonian Museums and Zoo are free in Washington DC, the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles is free, and even in smaller towns you can often find free things to do like library activities, free community events, and hiking/taking a tour of the town."},

{"title": "The Facebook Buy Nothing Project", "date": "Thursday, March 1, 2018", "text": "First I want to say that I have been rocking my no spend challenge.  In two months the only thing I have bought was a pair of $10 bowling shoes (thanks to hubby who buys me coffee drinks whenever I am looking less than peppy...which is pretty often).  Although my no spend challenge is only mine to do (with my money; hubby has his own money and spends on whatever he wants which isn't actually very much, so far this year he hasn't made any purchases either besides a couple of restaurant meals, groceries and gas, helping a couple of the kids out, and coffee drinks for me.  We both have more than enough of everything and haven't seen the inside of a store other than for groceries in ages!).And then today I was perusing the internet and saw an article on the Facebook Buy Nothing Project--it sounds like a cool idea (more info here).  People connect through Facebook which I have hardly used at all since the beginning of the year so I did go on to Facebook and joined the local group and liked their main page.  This sounds like an excellent way to encourage yourself and others not to spend plus share what you have or give away things to others who are trying not to spend so it in essence becomes like a cash-less economy kind of project.  Cool!"},
{"title": "Goodwill Clearance Center", "date": "Wednesday, February 28, 2018", "text": "Today we went over to the Goodwill Clearance Center and OMG it was something to see!  I think the clearance center is a last ditch effort to sell stuff that didn't sell at the regular Goodwill stores, so basically it is junk being sold by the pound instead of the piece.  There were dozens and dozens of what appeared to be professional trash pickers there sorting through every bin that came out of the back--they stay there for hours and hours doing this.  There were a few really nice things that people picked up so I guess if you are diligent about sorting through all of the stuff you can find some really good deals.  We didn't buy anything, just looked, but it was something to behold how professional and orderly the people were and how interesting the stuff was that was being sold."},

{"title": "Our 10 Best Purchases Ever!", "date": "Saturday, February 24, 2018", "text": "In no particular order...Over the air antennas.  If you live in a place that receives a lot of OTA stations (in our city we get about 50) these antennas can save more than a thousand dollars over the course of a year since you won't need to get cable TV.Netflix.  Again, for around $10 a month, Netflix gives you A LOT of TV shows and movies which can be watched in place of cable TV.House Seats/Fill A Seat.  If you live in a city with a lot of live entertainment, you should check and see if you can get a House Seats or Fill A Seat subscription.  For about $50 per year for two people, we have seen hundreds of shows ranging from comedy shows to concerts to magic shows to full-on Las Vegas spectacle shows.  Paying individually for these tickets would have cost thousands of dollars.A good carry-on bag.  For hubby it is a small rolling suitcase that fits in the overhead compartment on an airplane and for me it is a 33 litre backpack.  We have learned to travel light and only carry one carry-on bag each when we travel thus saving at least $100 per trip in baggage fees.Cookware and knives.  We have a few cast iron pans, a set of heavy bottom pans in a range of sizes, and five really good knives.  None of these things will ever need to be replaced since they are made to last forever and work really well thus negating the need to get rid of them and \"buy something better\".  There is nothing better and these will last long enough to be handed down to the kids and grandkids (one cast iron pan actually came from my grandmother so that means it would have lasted at least five generations when we give it to the grandkids!).Internet service.  Yes the price keeps going up as cable companies try to recoup money lost to cable cutters but for a service that costs $60 per month, it is well worth the money as it allows me to work from home, bank from home, watch Netflix, communicate with everyone I know, etc.A pocket knife.  I bought a Swiss Army knife with my babysitting money when I was about 12 and have carried it with me everyday since.  I use it to open boxes, open packages, cut tags off of new items, etc. and for the small price of less than $10, it has lasted for nearly 40 years!Tools.  We bought Craftsman tools years ago (back when they were good quality, now I have heard that brand referred to as \"crapsman\" sadly) and they have lasted for decades.  When we moved and downsized and figured our days of building things were probably over we sent them to the son and grandson who used them to build their house.  Good quality tools can last a lifetime--or more.Smartphone.  My purse is orders of magnitude lighter these days thanks to my smartphone.  It has replaced my dumb phone, camera, flashlight, paperback books, notebook and pen, and many more everyday items I used to carry with me.  This one small device can do everything and if you keep it long enough instead of buying every new annual iteration that comes out, it can actually cost you only pennies a day to use.Houses.  While some people have lost big in the housing market, we have been fortunate that our houses have always earned (and saved) us quite a bit of money.  We have always bought houses that we could afford, and that would shelter us for years (none of this flipping and/or pulling equity out of them at every opportunity).  By paying our mortgages down--and off--as quickly as possible we have always paid below market rate for shelter while having an asset that earns us money whether we used them for rentals or sold them outright."},
{"title": "I Love Coupons!", "date": "Friday, February 23, 2018", "text": "I'm not an extreme couponer or \"coupon queen\" by any stretch of the imagination but I do love me some coupons!  Today hubby used a coupon we got in our weekly junk mail for a $7.99 haircut (regularly $13.99), I used a $1 off coupon for a coffee drink, and we used some coupons in the grocery store today that were in their weekly flyer (a savings of over $12).  There are some people who have an entire coupon system and they spend hours each week search for and cataloging coupons/store sales flyers so they can save a lot of money on their shopping.  I don't go to that much effort but I do look through our junk mail for coupons on things we regularly use, check the Costco sales flyer when it comes out every few months, and go through the grocery store with their sales flyer in hand to make sure I don't miss any good discounts on things we would be buying anyway.  This is a great way to save a bit of extra money!"},
{"title": "20 More Things About Retirement (Part 2 of 2)", "date": "Thursday, February 22, 2018", "text": "Here is the second half of the list of things to consider in retirement...Entertainment.  When you retire and have an extra 8 to 10 hours to fill each day, people often need to budget for things to keep them busy.  Things like a bowling league (around $10 a day where we live), senior roller skating day (about $8), hiking (costs vary), can really add up.  Of course there are a lot of free things to do such as walking, volunteering, or doing free activities (which abound in Las Vegas) which can reduce the cost of entertainment.You will need your (legal) ducks in a row.  There are a bunch of legal documents that every retiree should have including a Will, Living Will, Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, Advanced Medical Directive, life insurance, etc.  These make the legal processes go much more smoothly if something should happen to you.Assistive devices.  As people age they may need a range of assistive devices--everything from dentures and hearing aids to glasses, a cane, or an electric scooter.  Some of these things may be covered by insurance, others may not be covered and they can be expensive so this is definitely an area to budget for.Watch out for scams.  For some reason, as soon as hubby hit about 65 it seems like he was targeted for scams.  Whether it was \"scam likely\" phone calls, emails, regular mail...it seems like it was raining \"great deals just for you!\" sorts of things that are nothing but scams.  It's like there is some sort of mailing list that can be sorted by age and those who are older are specifically targeted.  Never give any personal or financial info over the phone unless you specifically called for a service (like a mortgage lender or car insurance quote).Long-term care, nursing homes, assisted living--when you can't take care of yourself, who will?  This is a concern that many people don't deal with until there is a crisis but should be looked into along with your other retirement planning.  There is a massive difference between high quality (read, expensive) retirement centers and bottom-of-the-barrel Medicare-only nursing homes.Take care of your own death (financially speaking!).  When our elderly neighbor passed away I was really surprised (and impressed) that she had planned everything down to the last little detail about her death.  She had the money set aside to pay for everything (a big help to her family), all of her legal documents in order, she had even planned her funeral service!  This takes a lot of pressure off an already grieving family and paying ahead for all of your funeral/cremation/burial stuff takes a huge financial burden off the family as well.If you plan to work during retirement, either for something to do or for necessary additional income, know the rules about how much you can earn.  There are limits to how much extra income you can earn if you choose to take Social Security before your full retirement ageThere's this new thing called 'Swedish Death Cleaning' which is gaining in popularity.  Basically, you clean out all of your accumulated crap before you die so your kids don't have to.  It's actually a great idea--you live in a decluttered space (thus needing less living space in a downsized home), you can give away stuff before you die so your relatives don't fight over it afterwards, and it alleviates the problem of who gets to clean out the olderster's house/what to do with their junk that would otherwise happen after you are gone.Helping others.  We have always helped others whether it is giving to those in need, volunteering, or helping out the kids when they have a crisis.  This is actually a line in our budget because it isn't if but when a crisis will occur/someone will need a bit of help and since we have the money set aside to give, it is given as a gift with no expectation of return.Plan for a long life.  As this chart shows, a man born in 1900 would have had an average life expectancy of 47 years old (!) while a man born in the year 2000 has an average life expectancy of 80 years old.  Needing to pay for an extra 33 years of life takes a lot of extra money (one reason many pension funds are tanking...people are living so long and drawing pension funds for a lot longer than expected).  Whereas before people would need to fund maybe a decade of living after retirement, these days many can expect to live 20, 30, even 40 years after retiring which means a lot more planning (and funding) needs to occur for this possibility."},
{"title": "20 More Things About Retirement (Part 1 of 2)", "date": "Wednesday, February 21, 2018", "text": "After my little rant on retirement planning the other day, I thought about the many other things that went into planning for our retirement (or stuff we didn't even consider until much later), they include:If you are buying a \"forever\" house, it should probably be a single level house.  All of our houses have been two-story or tri-level houses including the house we have now but as we get older it kind of makes sense to have a single level house if you plan on living there the rest of your life for ease of access.When we moved hubby DID NOT want a big yard.  With a big yard we either ended up hiring landscapers to take care of it or doing the yard ourselves (a lot of work and neither one of us are yard people).  Our current yard requires a bit of landscaping a couple times a year because there are only palm trees and a couple of shrubs, and lots of rocks and gravel for a 'desert' look.We also made a point to buy a smaller house.  That means less cost (usually), less area to clean, less maintenance costs, and less area to paint/put in new flooring/etc.  Even if you retire and find your \"forever home\", you still need a fund to replace things that will eventually break or wear out.  So far we have replaced a built-in microwave, a hot water tank, a garbage disposal, a garage door opener, etc.  Most of these things have a certain life span so will eventually need to be replaced.  Fortunately we have a tile roof which should last for 50 years but some roofs need to be replaced more often than that.Maintenance costs are an area of the budget that have increased.  Years ago we fixed literally everything in our very old house, we even built a small house from the ground up.  These days anything that requires heavy lifting (we are both old and weak and don't want to injure ourselves), climbing on the roof, or other complicated fixes (replacing the toilet wax rings, for example) get hired out.  This is yet another area you will need to budget additional money for.Utilities and other housing costs.  I've never seen utility costs go down, only up.  Ditto with property taxes, HOA fees, etc.  This can be a challenge for people on a fixed income (especially property tax in an area where housing is booming); this is yet another thing to budget for in the future.Transportation costs.  Cars wear our eventually which will either require a replacement vehicle or a change in the way you transport yourself.  The cost of a new car is astronomical these days and on a fixed income, buying a new car may be a financial challenge.  Car insurance costs are always going up, and as you age, driving may become more difficult.  I did a little math and it looks like it would be cheaper for us to take public transit and Uber instead of owning cars but hubby likes his car very much and said \"no way\" to that idea.  Our cost for clothing has gone down.  We no longer need a work wardrobe and no longer shop at Macys and Saks.  These days we buy all the clothes we need at the Goodwill.  I do splurge on shoes, usually on clearance at TJ Maxx or Marshalls.Depending on your insurance, healthcare costs may remain the same or go through the roof.  It is shocking to hear how much some elderly people have to pay for their monthly medications.  People who have to pay their own insurance plan costs can find the costs doubling or tripling each year!We decided where to move for retirement based on several things including weather (no shoveling snow!!!), poker rooms (hubby likes to play poker so a state where this is legal was a requirement), cost of housing (at the time the housing market was bottom of the barrel here so we paid a super low price for our house; unless I was a multi-millionaire I wouldn't even consider moving to the hot housing markets like the Bay area, Seattle, etc due to the massive cost of housing), property tax (very low property tax here), general cost of living, state income tax (none here!), gun laws (I like my guns), easy access to an airport, etc.Click here for the next half of the list."},
{"title": "I Bought...Bowling Shoes", "date": "Tuesday, February 20, 2018", "text": "Even though I don't bowl and I am doing a no-spend year until my debts are paid off.  But the lady who is on hubby's bowling team asked me if I knew anyone who wanted to buy her bowling shoes because she bought better bowling shoes (these had never been worn but she couldn't return them) and she only wanted $10 for them so I immediately bought them.  My justification was that they were really cheap (about $30 less than buying them new) and I do bowl occasionally with hubby (and spend $3.95 each time renting bowling shoes) so this seemed like a really good deal.  Plus they were my size.  Overall I think it was an OK purchase that will save me money in the future."},
{"title": "Let's Talk About Retirement", "date": "Monday, February 19, 2018", "text": "I am currently, unofficially, semi-retired.  While hubby is fully retired, complete with pension and Social Security, I am too young for any of that for a good decade or more.  So we easily get by on his retirement funds and my freelance earnings and all is well...for now.BUT...and it is a big BUT, I am really really concerned about retirement-and not just my own--in the next 15 to 20 years.  Since nearly all of our friends are retired and have been that way for years, I see how generous pension programs, long-term investments, and having multiple streams of retirement income coming in can make for a very comfortable life after your working years are done.  On the flip side, when I worked in social services, I saw what happened to people who for one reason or another didn't have such a good plan for their retirement.  Often these people received only a tiny Social Security check each month and that isn't very much income at all.I think within the next couple of decades, a comfortable retirement will be out of the reach of many more people.  As states like Connecticut are wrestling with mounting pension debt (there is NO WAY the are going to recover this money IMHO), and other states have already been hacking away at pensions (money that retired folks were dearly counting on in their retirement), it doesn't seem like anyone is safe.  Social Security is already on shaky ground, and many state, county, and city pension plans are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy (there is two parts to this; one is the pension itself being under/unfunded and heading for bankruptcy once the fund runs out of money, and the second part is that the company that acts as \"insurance\" for pension funds--the company that is supposed to pay out for bankrupt pension plans--is running out of money and will soon be bankrupt itself.  This is a concern not only for retirees but the government as well.Fewer and fewer people are getting cushy pension plans with their jobs these days which means fewer and fewer people are paying in to support the cushy pensions which were guaranteed to employees years ago.  It just makes me wonder what will happen in the future.Just Googling \"pensions in the future\" turns up all kinds of negative news--from the generation that can't afford to retire to \"the disaster that's waiting to happen\" to 'what will happen to Chicago retirees when (not if) pensions dry up'.  Yikes!I know I need to be more proactive about planning for my own \"official\" retirement but it seems pretty dispiriting to consider all of my retirement \"options\" or lack thereof.  Social Security?  I have paid into it of course but doubt it will provide much more than a pittance in the future.  A pension from work?  Nope, none as I have been a freelancer most of my working life.  Rely on hubby's retirement income?  When he is alive it works fine but he is 20 years older than I am and if he dies before me I will be...I don't know where I will be.  There are age restrictions on drawing a spouse's Social Security (which I found out when a lady came to our office, her husband had suddenly died, and she was 50 years old, in other words way too young to draw any sort of Social Security from her own or her husband's work, she hadn't worked in decades, and she ended up in a very unfortunate spot...I think she still lives with her adult children) and I won't get any of his military pension after he is gone either (electing for the military's SBP plan at 20/40 years old wasn't even on our radar). So I need to get busy on my retirement planning.  I hope to have a paid off house in a few years and continue branching out with freelance projects but other, more tangible planning options remain nebulous.  Stocks?  Bonds?  Mutual Funds?  Real Estate investments?  At my age I feel like betting a large sum on black would be just as effective  :("},

{"title": "Should You Have a Credit Card?", "date": "Tuesday, January 30, 2018", "text": "Dave Ramsey is adamantly against having credit cards and with good reason--when you work with people who are continually digging themselves deeper in debt, you take away the shovel.  When we followed his plan to get out of debt, we cancelled all of our credit cards and paid off our debt and you know what, it worked!  When there is no means for adding more debt, it certainly makes it easier to get out of debt.Four or five years after we got out of debt, however, we decided to apply for some credit cards, mostly because our credit scores were tanking because we weren't using credit and we planned to buy another house.  So we got credit cards, used credit cards, and generally paid them in full each month.  Until I didn't.  I made several large purchases and while I always paid my credit cards on time and paid much more than the minimum payment, I still ended up carrying debt (which I am making great strides to pay off currently).So the question is, should people have credit cards?  Currently Americans are carrying $905 BILLION in credit card debt, a average of $15,654 per household with credit card debt.  YIKES!  Yes still many people feel like they can't live without at least a few credit cards.I think credit cards can be a useful part of your financial plan but only if you pay off the balance in full each month.  People like credit cards that offer some sort of reward for using them but getting 2% cash back on all purchases yet carrying a credit card balance which you pay 18% interest on is dumb.  I have a friend who has a Delta American Express card and he only flies Delta so he can get rewards on his credit card however I can almost always find flights that are cheaper than Delta plus the credit card carries an annual fee of $95 so in my book, that doesn't make much financial sense.Currently my plan is to keep my credit cards (they are all no fee, low interest cards from credit unions), pay off the one card I have a balance on, and use them sparingly (on large purchases which I have the money for so I can pay the card in full before the end of the billing cycle).  I am definitely NOT going to use them for lots of random purchases that I both don't need and can't afford.  I don't want to get rid of the cards and close the accounts because I do want to have a good credit score, and it is just psychologically more comfortable to know that I do have a lot of credit available if needed."},

Of all the interventions they looked at, only two were truly cost-saving: childhood immunizations (a no-brainer) and the counseling of adults on the use of low-dose aspirin.

{"title": "10 Financial Disasters to Avoid", "date": "Friday, January 26, 2018", "text": "For the love of all that's holy, please please, please never get involved in these potential financial disasters..Time shares.  If you have money to burn, go for it, but for the vast majority of people, time shares are a big annual expense and nearly impossible to get out of (thus the popularity of places such as Time Share Exit Team).  Take the thousands of dollars you would have spent on annual time share fees and book a luxury hotel for a week or so.Cosigning for anyone.  Even your beloved mother.  If someone needs a co-signer it means they have lousy credit because they don't pay their bills.  If they don't/won't/can't pay their bills you can bet that down the line the loan you cosigned for will end up being all yours to pay off.Boats, RVs, second homes, etc.  Again, if you have boatloads of money, go for it, but for most people these are very expensive items that you continually need to sink money into for payments and upkeep.  A LOT OF MONEY.  Better to rent these things, use them, then turn them back in with to financial leash to tie them to you.Payday lenders.  NEVER go to a payday lender.  300% interest on your loan...700% interest on your loan...you will forever be burying yourself in debt if you avail yourself of this type of loan.Rent to own places.  Again, you will be paying multiple times over for an item that's value is dropping like a rock.  If you need a TV, sofa, video game machine, etc, then buy used until you save up the money to buy new.  There is absolutely no reason to pay $5000 for a $700 TV.Leasing a car.  I can think of no good reason to lease a car (and no, tax write-offs aren't a good reason for the vast majority of people).  People usually lease a car because they want a car that is more expensive than they can afford, thus the attraction of the lower lease payment, and at the end of the lease you are left with a giant-sized outstanding debt on a car that may even be worth that much (and if you turn the car back in you will be dinged for over mileage and other things).  Just no.Long-term, hard-to-get-out-of gym memberships.  People get a gym membership with the best of intentions but if you stop going to the gym often you can't stop the monthly auto-pay from your credit card (depending on what your contract says, some are very scammy).  Loaning money to anyone.  We never loan money to anyone.  If the kids have a financial crisis we give them the money they need if we can afford it and let it be a gift.  So many relationships are torn apart because someone lends a friend or family member money and never get paid back thus causing hard feelings all around.Any loan on which you can barely squeak by on the monthly payments (house, car, other loans).  If you can barely afford the payment on your house or car, it will only take the loss of one pay check to bury you in debt (and probably lose the house or car eventually or be forced into bankruptcy).  Make sure your budget has plenty of wiggle room when it comes to committing to payments on anything.Other clear scams.  My cousin called me in a panic yesterday because she said her computer stopped working and there was a pop up that said her computer had a serious virus with a phone number to call to fix it.  That's a scam.  People calling and telling you your grandson has been injured and is in a foreign hospital and they need payment this very minute.  That's a scam.  An email that says you won a large cash prize and just need to send a small fee to claim the prize.  That's a scam.  I got a call once from a very harsh sounding lady who said I had an outstanding warrant and if I didn't pay a fine over the phone right away she would send the police to arrest me.  I told her no problem, give me the case number as I would be working at the courthouse later that day and I would take care of it then.  She slammed the phone down in my ear.  That was a scam too.  There are so many scams out there that you really need to check and double check things before you open your wallet."},
{"title": "Free Skills You Can Learn Online", "date": "Thursday, January 25, 2018", "text": "When I think back to just 30 years ago, there were so many things that were impossible/near impossible to learn without going to an actual teacher or a class.  And these you had to pay for.  Of course there were many books available on topics ranging from car repair to knitting but often the diagrams you saw in a book were not very easy to decipher and trying to learn a language or how to type from a book was difficult indeed.  Fast forward to today (and today's internet) where you can learn all kinds of valuable skills just by searching YouTube.Of course you can take an Open CourseWare class on comparative philosophy or something like that but I propose you spend your time online learning skills that have, or can have, some sort of monetary value in the future.  Here's some ideas:How to play a music instrument.  If you get good enough you can use this skill for busking, playing for pay in a coffee shop, or giving lessons.How to make household repairs.  This in itself will save you a boatload of money, especially if you are a homeowner and don't have to super to call when something goes wrong with the plumbing/electrical/other household system.Specialized IT skills like coding, website design, SEO, PhotoShop, etc.  Once you know what you are doing, you can either sell these skills to the highest bidder or use them to get a raise at your current job.  Years ago my boss asked if I knew anyone who could make the company a website, of course I jumped on the opportunity (I mostly needed the extra money) but I had no idea what I was doing.  After plowing through a 300-page book on 'How to Make a Website in FrontPage' we had a semblance of a website.  These days a 20 minute YouTube video will show you exactly how to make a good looking WordPress website.  Advanced skills are also taught online and for free.The internet is bursting with artsy and crafty ideas--as well as lessons--for those both skilled and unskilled.  Many of these people sell their works online at places like Etsy or in person at craft shows and you can too once you have acquired the basic skills.You can also learn many money-saving skills online.  How to cook (saves money over eating out), how to cut your kid's hair, how to grow a garden, how to budget, how to repair your clothes, the basics on investing, etc.  These may not make you money with these skills but they will definitely save you money.Take advantage of all of the wonderful (free!) opportunities available online and reap the financial rewards!"},
{"title": "Pad Thai", "date": "Wednesday, January 24, 2018", "text": "Today's dinner was pad thai (see photo above and yes I made that myself!).  We tend to eat ethnic food several times a week, whether it is Mexican, Italian, Japanese, Indian, Thai, Filipino, Greek, even Ethiopian.  We are fortunate that we live in a city where you can find a restaurant for nearly every country on the globe but eating out at these restaurants can get expensive.  I particularly like Indian buffets but at $15 each for our favorite Indian lunch buffet, we don't go there very often.  However, with a bit of experimenting, Googling recipes, and YouTube videos, I've been able to replicate many of my favorite ethnic dishes for much less than the cost of going to a restaurant.  Also, once I have figured out how to cook these dishes, the cost for the components of these meals is really cheap (most countries rely on basics like beans, noodles, and vegetables instead of more expensive meat and dairy products...it's a double win!)"},
{"title": "10 Things That Have Saved Us Money Over the Past Year", "date": "Tuesday, January 23, 2018", "text": "I am always looking for ways to save money.  Here are ten ways we have saved money over the past year:I have a visa card at one of my banks (I have three banks total) that I have used and paid off several time.  They must have missed me because about six months ago I got a letter in the mail from the bank asking if I wanted to do a balance transfer of other credit cards at 0% interest for one year.  I jumped on the offer and transferred balances from three credit cards to this credit card.  I am now paying off this card as quickly as possible and will have it paid off before the year of 0% interest is over.An InstaPot.  I might be the last person on the planet to buy one of these electric pressure cookers/slow cookers but I absolutely love it.  I got it on sale for half off ($50 my cost) and we have used it many times.  As a pressure cooker it rocks!  The old fashioned pressure cookers that you use on the stove are pretty scary as there is always the possibility of the seal failing and the pot exploding, but these new pressure cookers are very secure.  Now we can pull something out of the freezer like a roast, throw it in the pot, and it will be fully cooked within the hour.When T Mobile had an offer to add a third line for free, we immediately changed our plan.  The offer was only available for a short time and I've never seen the offer again but it is \"forever\" so now we have three lines of unlimited service for a flat $100 a month.  We gave the third line to one of the kids which helps him out financially and while there isn't a real financial benefit for us (since we were previously paying $100 for two lines), we still feel like we got a great deal on this.When the hubby needed new tires for his van we shopped around.  We like Discount Tires since they always provide good deals and great service but the price for four tires was higher than Costco and Walmart so I asked the manager if he could beat the lower sale price I found at Costco.  Not only did they match the Costco price but they gave me a rebate form for an additional $100 visa gift card.  Score!I've used H & R Block online to do my taxes for years.  Each year in December they send an email that says something like \"if you start doing your taxes now we will give you an additional $10 off your tax filing\".  So I always start my taxes early (you can complete them and file them any time) and get this discount.  This year, after starting my taxes, it said that due to our financial circumstances (we don't itemize as the standard deduction works for us) filing this year will be free instead of $24.95!Nearly a year ago I got an application in the mail for an AmEx card.  The deal was that if we spent something like $1000 within three months we would get 60,000 air miles on Delta and the card's fee for the first year was waived.  I took advantage of this deal, used the card to buy groceries and necessities for a few months, paid it off, then used the miles for free airline tickets when we needed to take an emergency trip.  As the annual fee is $95 and we didn't really use the card, I cancelled it before the annual fee came due.Early last spring we decided to take a cruise.  As usually I searched for last minute cruises and found one for $495 per person for a 15 day cruise (this was more than $2000 off its usual price per person!).  The price was so cheap because it was bought last minute (they want to fill ALL of their cabins) and because it was off-season (between the popular Christmas holidays and spring break vacations).When I heard last summer that the lifetime National Parks Pass for seniors was going from $10 to $80, I immediately told everyone it that age group that I knew to get a pass.  It pays you back after one use and it is good for the rest of your life!  Hubby already had one of these passes but we had several relatives jump on this offer so again, while we didn't see an actual savings from this, it was good karma for helping out other people.Samsung recently had a rebate program where if you trade in an older phone you could get a new S8+ phone for $400 off.  I really wanted a new phone as I had a Galaxy S7 phone which worked fine but was really small (my old eye need a bigger screen!).  After checking out what used S7 phones sell for online (around $300 and less) I figured this was a great deal.  I am now the happy owner of a S8+ phone for what I feel was a reasonable price.Any time I want to get something new, I usually opt for trying to find it at the Goodwill first mostly because I don't know if I will actually use the item much or want to keep it for very long and it would be a waste of money to pay full price then decide I won't use it.  Case in point--cases actually--over the past year I really wanted an air popcorn popper, a waffle maker, and several home decor items.  We found all of these items in great shape and for a fraction of the price of new, at the Goodwill.  As I kind of though, we rarely use the popcorn popper or the waffle maker but at least we didn't spend much for these items."},

{"title": "Should You Get Amazon Prime?", "date": "Saturday, January 20, 2018", "text": "Today I came across this article 'Is Amazon Prime Worth It?' and I think for us, it is.  Maybe.  I've had an Amazon Prime membership off and on over the past few years, mostly because hubby likes to watch movies and Amazon offers a lot of movies that he can watch for free that are different than what he can find on Netflix.  Also, Amazon was the first streaming service to allow the download of free movies to watch when you are offline which came in pretty handy when we traveled a lot.Since I haven't been shopping online (or anywhere else for that matter) since the end of last year, their \"free two day shipping\" isn't as much of a draw as it was when when I resubscribed prior to the last holiday season.  Amazon Prime is $99 a year (they also have monthly plans) which is about $8 a month.  For us I think that the price is well worth it just for the movies hubby watches each month (a lot!).  If you buy things from Amazon you can easily recoup the $8 a month fee just from free shipping (although you need to be careful, some items that qualify for free prime shipping cost more than the same item sold through a third party that don't qualify for free shipping).There are also deals for Prime members such as Amazon Prime Day (never tried it), free sample boxes (you pay for the sample box then get the same amount as a credit for a future order), free ebooks to download (haven't tried this as my library keeps me up to my ears in free e-books), and a bunch of other benefits.So whether or not Amazon Prime is a good deal for you, depends on how you will use it.  If Netflix works for you, you rarely order from Amazon, and don't need and free e-books, it probably isn't worth it.  If, however, you can recoup the $8 per month cost in movies and mailing fees, it probably is."},

{"title": "Should You Get a Costco Membership?", "date": "Thursday, January 18, 2018", "text": "We made a run to Costco today so I could use up a gift card before it expired.  We usually only shop at Costco to buy a few favorites in bulk butfor most things, however, the product sizes are just too big for the two of us to use before they go bad or lose their appeal. We used to buy a Costco membership each year and buy in bulk because we had a houseful of people to shop for.  For some years, one of my clients would give me an annual membership (a $60 value) but lately we just don't buy enough there to justify buying a membership.  Lately, my SIL has graciously given us Costco gift cards for various holidays (Christmas and birthdays) which is really nice of her and it also allows us to shop at Costco without a membership card (this is only one way people can shop at Costco without a membership card).  For those who have a big family to buy for or who like the good prices on the higher quality items Costco sells, a membership may be a great deal.  For us, there are only a few items we like to get there......I love the really cheap bulk oatmeal which I use for cereal, to make granola, to make energy bars, to make oatmeal cookies, and to make oat flour....and I LOVE their toilet paper--this stuff is the best!...we also like to buy dried beans in bulk (per serving this is a great price!), large size spices, 50 pound bags of rice, etc....I took a picture of this giant bag of popcorn which was the size of a toddler.  We didn't buy it, I was just surprised at how huge it was!"},

{"title": "100 Ways to Cut Your Monthly Spending", "date": "Monday, January 15, 2018", "text": "There are soooo many ways people can cut their monthly spending.  Some are so simple you will wonder why you didn't do these things before, others are so extreme most people will think yeah, no way.  Here they are:Call around and compare car insurance prices; some companies are much cheaper than others.Call around and compare home owner/renter insurance prices.  Again, some companies can save you a lot of money.Increase your insurance deductibles (be sure to put the amount of the deductible aside in a savings account should you need it).Be sure about what your insurance does and does not cover.  You don't want to be in a flood or hurricane and later find out your insurance doesn't cover floods or hurricanes.  If you need additional insurance, get it.Conserve electricity.  If you are billed by the kilowatt you can save a lot of money this way.Conserve water.  Again, if you are billed for actual usage you can save a lot this way.Conserve gas.  Ditto.See what freebies your utility companies offer.  So far we have received free shower heads and kitchen faucets, free insulation tape to put around doors, and a rebate on our new washer and dryer.Check out the fees for trash removal, some companies have lower rates for smaller cans.Refinance your mortgage if you can get a lower interest rate.If you are no longer required to have private mortgage insurance, cancel it.See if your city/county offers property tax rebates you qualify for (senior, veteran, etc).Drive an older car (usually saves on both insurance and registration fees).Consider if your family can go from two cars to one or from one car to none.Try walking or bicycling instead of driving.Drive less by car pooling and/or grouping your errands.Consider getting a monthly bus pass and using public transit (this can save a lot of money if you usually drive yourself and need to pay tolls/parking to get to work).See if your job would allow you to work from home either full or part time.See if it makes financial sense for one parent to stay home instead of work (the price for daycare is astronomical these days!).Let your kids walk or take the bus to school everyday instead of driving them.Look for ways to cut costs if you have an infant (cloth instead of disposable diapers, breast feeding instead of formula, not buying every baby item you see at the department store, etc).Look for free entertainment options in your community.Cook breakfast and dinner at home; brown-bag it for lunch at school or work.Consider becoming a vegan.  While that is pretty extreme, it is better for your health and much cheaper than keeping a freezer full of meat and animal products.Also, never be without a bottle of water and snacks--this keeps you from hitting up the vending machine or fast food drive thru if you have a craving for food.Save eating out for special occasions and skip unhealthy fast food all together.When we do eat out we always buy one meal and split is, even then we often end up with a doggie bag because restaurant meals are so huge.Make your own treats at home.  If you have a sweet tooth you can easily make cookies, pie, milkshakes, even candy for a fraction of the cost of buying treats at the store.Do as many home maintenance tasks as you can yourself; there are literally YouTube videos for everything from cleaning out gutters to fixing appliances to how to mow your own lawn.Take advantage of 0% credit card transfer promos (but only if you are certain you will pay off the debt AND not use the card until it has a $0 balance).Do everything possible to avoid student loan debt (apply for scholarships, start at a community college instead of a university, buy used books, etc).If you do have student loan debt, look into options for lowering the interest on these loans and see if you qualify for any forgiveness programs as well.Do small home maintenance tasks that will save money: fix toilet leaks, turn down the water heater, fix leaking faucets, etc.Use an OTA (over the air) antenna and cancel cable TV.Check out movies from the library instead of subscribing to cable or Netflix.Check out books and music from the library instead of buying them or having a subscription-based plan for these.Cancel the gym membership and do calisthenics/walking in your home/neighborhood.Cancel any unnecessary recurring payments (newspaper subscription, website subscription, etc).If you must travel, do it as cheaply as possible (find the cheapest fares on Google flights, books discounted last minute hotel rooms or better yet, stay with friends and family).Do a staycation instead of a vacation this year.Go all ninja on your food shopping bill (shop loss leaders, buy in bulk if it's cheaper, use coupons, shop at ethnic stores for cheaper staples, ask for discounts on day old baked goods and produce, etc).Consider store brands for both food and toiletries like shampoo.  Some are wonderful some are awful, you kind of need to make a list of what you like and don't like.Compare cell phone plans (these tend to change often so always be on the lookout for the best plan deals).Reduce the speed of your internet if possible (do you really need screaming fast internet when moderately fast will work?).Shop at thrift stores for clothing instead of department stores.Get free clothing (ask friends and family for hand-me-downs, set up a clothing swap, etc).Mend/repair your own clothes to make them last longer.Get rid of clothes that require dry cleaning (if you must have dry-clean-only clothes look into cheaper ways to clean them with products in your dryer).Cut your own hair or have a friend do it instead of going to a salon.  You can easily do your own color too.Consider doing your own manicures, pedicures, facials, and waxing at home too...these are easy things to learn and can save a lot of money.Buy your makeup at Target/Walmart instead of at high end department stores.See if you can cut back on the number of personal products you need (a couple friends use dozens of skin and hair products a day!  eekkk).Chose inexpensive hobbies (like walking or throwing horse shoes instead of golf and SCUBA diving).Limit the amount of extracurricular activities/sports your kids do.Consider volunteering at places you would want to spend time at anyway.  Some people like the theater so they volunteer as ushers and get free theater passes.  Others volunteer at running events then get free race entries for their efforts.Get rid of your time share even if you have to pay to do this; it will save you money in the long run.Drink water with all meals (this is much cheaper and healthier than drinking milk, juice, or soda with meals).Stop the bad habits: quit drinking alcohol, quit smoking, quit the daily run to Starbucks, etc.Cut back on gift giving (give fewer gifts to immediate family members for birthdays and holidays; stop buying gifts for your dozens of extended family members).Pay more towards your debts (mortgage, car payment, loans and credit cards) than required to save money on interest.  The \"debt snowball\" works really well for this.Look for ways to cut costs for your pets (groom them yourself, make homemade treats, see if cheaper food will work, etc).Aside from regular bills which you pay online, use cash for all of your other expenditures instead of a credit or debit card.Buy a thermos and make your own coffee at home to take with you.Fix any personal issues that are costing you money (addiction issues, legal issues, outstanding warrants, etc).Be a technology late adapter instead of an early adapter--this will give tech companies time to work the bugs out and the cost of new tech like computers and TVs usually drop precipitously after being out for a while.Shop around for health insurance plans every year.  Plans and costs change annually so you want to find the best deal.If you ever need a prescription, ask you doctor for samples also ask if there is a cheaper, generic version of your prescription available.See if you qualify for any programs in your community (there are so many depending on where you live; free or reduced school lunch, senior discounts, military discounts, reduced transit passes for low income or disabled people, etc).Negotiate prices if possible (this works on everything from buying clothes at the store that are a bit damaged to settling hospital bills to buying a house).Look around for the best deal on your bank accounts.  Usually credit unions have inexpensive or no-fee accounts and offer other services such as notary for free.Always Google for the best discounts you can find (from TruCar when buying a car to promo codes for online orders to forums that tell you it is cheaper for even non-members to get their glasses or prescriptions at Costco...the internet is full of useful, money-saving information).Figure out if joining a warehouse club like Costco or Sams Club will save you money.  This used to save us money when we had a houseful of kids and bought in bulk, these days we get a Costco gift card from a friend who is a member which allows us to shop there without a membership.Wait on big purchases.  There is seldom a time when you absolutely need to make a big purchase this very minute (a busted hot water tank not withstanding).  Waiting to make a big purchase allows you to determine if you really need the item, allows you to look for alternatives, and you can also wait for sales, etc.Consider if you have services that you really don't use any more but never got around to cancelling (a friend just cancelled his land line after not using it for a couple of years!  Another friend finally cancelled her housekeeper which she really needed when all of the kids lived at home and she was working but now that she is retired and by herself she doesn't need that kind of service anymore).Pull your free credit report annually and make any corrections/improvements necessary.  Your credit score can make a price difference on your insurance, for example, and can even be used by employers to determine if they will hire you!Learn your investment options inside and out.  Retirement plans, investment plans, 401Ks, 403Bs...there are a lot of ways to invest your money and there are A LOT of rules and options and tax consequences that go along with this so seek out a knowledgeable adviser to help you make the best decisions about these plans.Always always try to use only your bank's no-fee ATM instead of just any random ATM which will charge you each time you use it.  In a pinch you can often withdraw cash when you purchase groceries with your bank's debit card which is another option.Never never write a check or use your bank card when there aren't enough funds in your account; overdraft fees are outrageous these day!Keep any gift cards you get in your wallet with a running total of how much is on the card.  Try to use these cards as soon as possible so you won't forget you have them.Make it a habit to review all bills you receive--from phone and utility bills to credit card statements and other loan documents--to be sure there are no problems such as unusual usage on the utility accounts to purchases you didn't make on your credit card bills.Keep a calendar of your bills and their due dates.  You never want to pay late and incur late fees.Make it a habit to write down every penny you spend for a couple of months.  This will give you a good idea of where you are spending money and help you patch holes in your spending plan; my Starbucks spending alone is enough to make me woozy some months :(Look for cheaper ways to purchase items you don't want to scrimp on.  For example we buy bottled water but it is cheaper to buy it in the 5 gallon size than in the smaller bottles.  I also won't scrimp on shoes so I buy my favorite brands as heavily discounted a possible.Consider the associated costs that come with your purchases.  My friend just bought a house with a pool thinking it would be nice to have a pool.  What she didn't bargain for was the increased property insurance cost, the huge power bill to heat the thing, and the repair fees when some part of the motor went toes up.  Everything you buy usually has some sort of associated cost but this was a very expensive learning experience. Avoid potential financial disasters like the plague.  These include payday loans, rent to own places, cosigning for anyone, vehicle leases, time shares, gym memberships you can't get out of, etc.Try bartering.  It takes courage and nerve the first time you try this but once you get the hang of it (and find other barterers in your community) it can be fun, money saving, and profitable.There are so many items marketed as \"have to haves\" which you really don't need.  Air fresheners can be toxic, flushable wipes often mess up your plumbing, expensive cleaners are often less effective than vinegar and lemon juice, etc.Make regular trips to the dentist for cleanings and xrays.  While this is an expense, it can save you a ton of money on expensive crowns and root canals.Consider medical tourism.  While this isn't for the faint of heart, if you need a lot of expensive repairs to your body or teeth, getting the work done in a foreign country can save many thousands of dollars.Save postage.  I pay all of my bills online, also, instead of sending bulky gifts which are expensive to mail we usually send cash (in check form) or gift cards now.Get personal recommendations for services that will cost you money.  Whether you are looking for a car repair shop or a new dentist, personal recommendations are usually better than anonymous online reviews (although I do check these too).  Have a professional do your taxes (or an online service; I use H & R Block online).  Since tax laws change so often you can often save money by having a pro tell you about deductions you may be missing by doing your taxes on your own with a pencil and calculator.Be sure your tax withholding is accurate.  You don't want to give Uncle Sam a giant, interest-free loan each year.For extreme savers, moving to a smaller house or even moving to a lower cost of living area may be a great way to save money.  In the extreme extreme category are students who live in their cars while going to college and workers who live in their vans at remote work sites instead of staying at a long-term hotel.Use your interpersonal skills to save money.  Whether it is charming your new date into a picnic instead of a high end restaurant or challenging friends to a no-spend month or negotiating with the spouse to make drastic spending cuts, how you approach financial issues is often as important as the outcome of those financial issues.As your kids get older, cut back on how much you spend on them and have them earn some of their own money.  This is great for teaching them life skills as well as financial skills.Never loan money to anyone and expect it back.  If we can't give money as a gift, we don't give it at all.  Personal loans often lead to hurt feelings, broken friendships, and small claims court!Sign up for birthday freebies for you and everyone in the family.  There are so many places that offer birthday freebies--from restaurants to ice cream places and more--that this is a great way to augment birthday celebrations.Shop Dollar Stores but buy reasonably,  It isn't reasonable to expect great things when you pay $1 for a tool but spending $1 on gift wrap, calendars, etc. is worth the money.  Food can be hit or miss there (I would never buy meat or food products from China there but dry beans and name brand food items are OK).Google for even more ways to save money on your spending.  This is a hot topic and there are thousands of pages on how to do this."},

{"title": "Staying Busy--On the Cheap--In Retirement", "date": "Saturday, January 13, 2018", "text": "The hubby and I have been retired for about six years now.  There are three things I've learned about retirement that many people don't consider when they are in the pre-retirement planning stages: #1 you will basically be living on a fixed income for the rest of your life, #2 you will have A LOT of time to fill, and #3 it takes money to stay busy so you don't die of boredom.  Let's look at these things a bit closer:#1 you will basically be living on a fixed income for the rest of your life.  Most people have a few sources of retirement income and those sources don't vary much over the years.  There is social security which comes with a small cost of living adjustment each year which in no real way keeps up with the actual cost of living.  There is your pension (if you have one) that may or may not come with an annual cost of living adjustment but it isn't going to jump like your income does when you are fully employed and changing jobs to increase your income, it stays pretty steady.  There is investment income which may or may not increase over the years.  And occasionally there is part time job income (you need to be careful that this income doesn't mess up your social security).#2 you will have A LOT of time to fill.  Most people love the idea of retirement where they don't have to go to work, they can sleep in, they can binge-watch Netflix, they don't have to work for an idiot boss in a toxic work environment, and they can do whatever they want.  What they don't usually realize is that work (and preparing for work, getting to and from work, etc) can rack up 10 to 12 hours a day of their time!  When you are retired that is quite a bit of time to fill as binge-watching Netflix and sleeping in rarely fills all of your day which leaves you sitting at home bored silly eventually.#3 it takes money to stay busy so you don't die of boredom.  If you were to spend your retirement days doing activities that cost money (mani/pedi in the morning, lunch with the ladies at noon, a matinee movie, dinner out with the hubby, the theater after dinner) you would probably end up broke in short order.  Here are the things we do to fill our days during retirement (most of which cost little to nothing):volunteer (I've volunteered with several organizations in Las Vegas, it's a fun, interesting way to keep busy and help other people at the same time)work temp jobs (I do some freelance work for my old clients and also work at the WSOP for six weeks each summer)bowling (hubby is on a couple of bowling leagues; fortunately the weekly fees are very inexpensive as they are senior leagues and also fortunately he usually wins enough in side pots and league winnings to completely pay for all of his bowling each season)enjoy free and inexpensive things in the community (luckily there are always free things to do around Las Vegas nearly every single day.  In my other blog I highlight the things we do which range from free rodeo events to walking around the city to checking out free community events).do those time consuming things that people always think about doing in retirement (I wrote a book (meh), tried gardening (failure, except for the lemons which grow like crazy), worked on my genealogy research (fascinating!), and I'm learning to knit and play the piano via YouTube).my inexpensive hobby is walking and hiking (gear is cheap, guided hikes are free, my walking club is very inexpensive, and I can basically walk anywhere, anytime in Las Vegas).I love to read (fortunately our library allows me to download thousands of free e-books)Hubby loves to watch movies (thank goodness for Netflix)and we do a bit of socializing (we have family and friends here who often plan parties and lunches out plus we have oodles of friends and relatives who like to visit Las Vegas).Overall we stay quite busy!"},

{"title": "In Praise of the Annual Pass", "date": "Tuesday, January 9, 2018", "text": "One of the ways we stretch our entertainment dollars is to buy annual passes for activities that we do often.  In addition to a lifetime pass that hubby bought for the National Parks (he bought this a couple of years ago when the lifetime parks pass for seniors was $10, it has since gone up to $80), we also have an annual pass for Nevada State Parks which means instead of paying a daily entry fee, for a flat rate we can go to any park, any time, just by showing the pass.When we first moved to Las Vegas we got an annual shows pass which meant we could go to a wide variety of Las Vegas shows--from stage shows to comedy shows to concerts, etc--all for less than $100 for both of us for the entire year.  When we had the nieces come and visit for a couple of months we bought annual passes for them for the local children's museum (even though they were only here for a couple of months, the low cost for an annual pass more than saved us money when we took them there about once a week).  You can find annual passes for museums, parks, zoos, science centers, and many other activities; this is a great way to save money if you use the pass often enough throughout the year."},

{"title": "10 Ways We Save Money Living in Las Vegas", "date": "Sunday, January 7, 2018", "text": "Having lived in Las Vegas for more than five years now, we have found several ways to make our money go further here...Our library system is amazing.  I have literally downloaded thousands of free e-books from the library since we moved here.  Our library also has free entertainment events (we've watched everything from brass bands to Highland dancers to wonderful lectures), free movies we can borrow, free music we can borrow...so much free stuff!Until a month ago we enjoyed free over-the-air HD TV.  Since the entirety of the city is a bowl-shaped valley, nearly everyone is in line of sight of all of the major TV broadcasters here.  That means that you can buy a $20 OTA antenna and enjoy more than 50 free stations.  For us, however, our internet price recently increased to $65 a month but if we got a package of internet plus basic cable the price would be $60 per month (??) which is what we now have.There is free entertainment everywhere.  At its most basic, we can walk down the famous Las Vegas Strip or Fremont area and be entertained watching people but there is so much more free entertainment here from rodeo events (at the Southpoint Arena) to live bands (Fremont Experience), free community events (parades, watching the Las Vegas marathon, etc), and free volunteer opportunities (ie: volunteer at a major event like the Electric Daisy Carnival and get free passes for the rest of the event).There are so many discount shopping opportunities!  From the 99 Cent Store (everything is 99 cents including produce, dairy, food, toiletries, decor, etc) to the Goodwill (we have amazing Goodwill stores here since the people donating are from all over the world!) to every cheap chain restaurant (love In N Out Burger) to Ikea.Driving can be both expensive (car insurance is not cheap here and annual registration is based on the car's value) yet very inexpensive (I used to drive 30,000+ miles a year but Las Vegas is a very compact city--plus we no longer work--so I now drive about 8,000 miles a year which means less gas and less wear and tear).There is no state income tax.  This would be a better thing if we were still high income earners but no state income tax is a savings for people who live here.  Note that you really need to look at overall tax burden to see if a no income tax state is your best bet when it comes to taxes.Travel to and from Vegas is dirt cheap.  We once took the Megabus to Los Angeles for 50 cents!  Since Las Vegas is both a national and international travel destination there are lots of cheap flights to and from Vegas--we can go to Asia for less than $500 round trip and round trip flights to New York and other US destinations is usually less than $99 each way.The city caters to both retirees and military members.  We receive a discount on our car registration each year because hubby is retired military, there are $4 movies for seniors at many theaters, free buffets for military members at the casino each Veterans and Memorial Day, free walking and hiking clubs, etc.Utilities are pretty cheap here.  I still haven't figured out why our water bill in Seattle, where there is water everywhere, was $40 per month yet our water bill here in Vegas is $25 per month.  Garbage removal, sewer, power, and natural gas are also pretty inexpensive.Casino comps are a real thing.  Hubby likes to play poker (with a small allowance each month to do so) but for each hour he plays, he is given $1 in comps by the casino which can be used in the casino's restaurants, gift shops, etc.  We almost always eat free in every restaurant we go to using comps."},
{"title": "Saving Money on My Hair", "date": "Saturday, January 6, 2018", "text": "That's me in the photo.  Actually it's my hair.  Today I had hubby give me a haircut in order to save money.  I've been doing this for about five years and so far, so good.  Before, he steadfastly refused to try cutting my hair even though he cut the kid's hair until they moved out but I finally talked him in to trying and it came out pretty good.  I usually get a professional haircut every four months and have hubby give it a trim every month just to keep it manageable.  It's a great way to save money."},

{"title": "10 Fabulous Things Today", "date": "Thursday, January 4, 2018", "text": "There have been so many fabulous things today!This is the first time I had an Amazon order delivered to an Amazon locker instead of my house.  I always wait at home all day for deliveries so porch pirates won't grab them but a week ago I ordered a couple of things from Amazon and decided to try having the delivery made to a locker which is near my house.  This is a wonderful way to get my packages--free, easy to get to, secure, and easy to claim (just punch the code they email you into the screen and a little door pops open so you can get your package)!I put my spending money for the month in my wallet (in cash, in $100 bills) and I haven't spent anything yet this year.  First of all there is nothing I really need and second of all I don't want to break a hundred dollar bill just to buy something.  Cash only living rocks!I just found this new subreddit (and yes, I am so far keeping my resolution to spend less than an hour a day on social media) and it lists all kinds of free ebooks you can download!Another subreddit I check out occasionally is BuyItForLife.  This is a great place to crowd source information on what items seem to last forever.  Many household items (cast iron pans, good knives, etc) are well worth a higher price if they will last forever.And from the \"I never would have thought of that\" file, this person planted cheap birdseed and ended up with a beautiful garden.  Cool!I've been killing two birds with one stone since the first of the year by doing my daily five mile walks around new places the hubby and I want to check out for our activity of the day.  I am tracking these places in my other blog which can be found here.While I love the snow, we are so glad we didn't end up moving to Connecticut--I think I like the snow better in photos than in person.  Meanwhile the family in New England are all snowed in for the day.  The photos are very pretty though!So far all of the activities we have been doing, and plan to do this month, have been free.  There are several places I check see what kind of free community events are being offered including our local library, state parks, and other community calendars.  Your area may have similar places that offer free community events and activities which are fun for the whole family.I was checking on Zillow to see how much a neighbor's house was listed for sale for.  Holy crap was I surprised to see that the houses in our neighborhood have more than doubled in price since we bought our house.  Not that we plan to move but wow!  Apparently our local economy is on the brink of a boom according to this article.Finally, I came across this article and it was rather inspiring and had some really good resources at the end of the article.  I can code (marginally) but it would have been really nice to have all of these resources available back when I was creating websites and learning this stuff on the fly."},
{"title": "Making Granola", "date": "Wednesday, January 3, 2018", "text": "Have you seen the price of granola at the grocery store?  In our area a small bag of fancy granola can cost $5(!) so I did what any frugal person would do and decided to make my own (and it tastes much better than the store-bought stuff IMHO).  Here's my simply recipe for granola:Nuts (I buy a big bag of peanuts at the 99 Cent store, put them in a ziploc bag, then take a hammer to them until they are smashed into tiny pieces).  Put the smashed nuts in a big bowl.Oatmeal (I buy a huge box of old fashioned oatmeal--not the quick cooking kind--at Costco for about $7.  I put enough oats into the bowl to look proportional to the nuts about 3 to 1).I mix the nuts and oatmeal together then add brown sugar (again, add as much or as little as you want, I don't like super sweet cereal so I don't add much).Then I add cinnamon to the mix and stir everything up.  Some people like to add salt as well but I don't add any as the nuts are salty enough.In a separate bowl mix vegetable oil and maple syrup (I use about 1/2 cup of oil to 1/3 cup of maple syrup) then pour this over the oats and mix together.Put the granola in a big pan in a 275 degree oven.  I bake it about 1 1/2 hour, stirring often, you want it to be dry and flaky when done.Before I eat the cereal I add raisins or dates or bananas or any other sort of dried fruit I have on hand.Sorry this recipe isn't more exact.  There are a lot of recipes for granola online and since I learned how to make this some years ago I just make it by what looks right.  Anyway it comes out really tasty and there are numerous variations you can make to the recipe (add other nuts and seeds, add other spices, etc) and best of all, it is super cheap to make at home compared to what you would pay in the store!"},

{"title": "New Year's Resolutions", "date": "Friday, December 29, 2017", "text": "When I first made up a list of goals for the coming year it was long (408 to be exact), it would have been a challenge (basically traveling here, there and everywhere to complete each task), but the problem was that they were conflicting (pay off car was one yet another was travel to each of the 50 states; one was don't eat any junk food yet another was bake a crepe cake and a princess cake).  So after giving it more thought I decided to make a small list of resolutions that didn't conflict with each other yet when all were completed I will have made great strides in my life by the end of the year.  Here they are:No spend year (food, toiletries, and the Goodwill are OK).  I have so much stuff.  When we sold everything to travel for a while some years ago I had very few things yet had everything I needed.  Since we settled down again we have acquired so much stuff!  This goal should keep my spending in check, help me stop buying stuff I don't need, and help me save money, yet assure I have the basics (food, clothing, soap, etc).  Plus when I told hubby we wouldn't be traveling anywhere next year he was supremely happy (after two months of travel this year he was exhausted).  The only caveat to this is that I can buy any really really necessary items (like printer ink if I run out during the year).Walk five miles a day, eat better, and do some sort of activity every day.  I think it will be a challenge to walk five miles a day but it is quite possible between my walking group, my treadmill, and the nine months of perfect weather we have here so I just need to motivate myself to do this every day.  Eating better should work itself out since if I am not spending money I can't buy Starbucks and Baskin Robbins almost daily.  As for activities, there are so many free things to do in Las Vegas that we can entertain ourselves for the entire year without spending any money.Post to this blog and a couple other blogs every single day next year.  I've always wondered if I had the discipline to write every single day, I guess I will find out!Learn to knit and play the piano.  I have yarn and knitting needles and I have a piano keyboard but I have never learned how to do these things so I will hit up YouTube and learn some useful skills this year.Pay off my car and two credit cards.  The credit cards should be easy to pay off (yeah tax return) but the car should be a bit of a challenge.  Getting back to debt free is THE premier goal of mine this year.Write five books.  This may be the most impossible goal but if I work on this daily it may happen (it would also increase my income and help me with getting back to debt free).  I know some writers churn out 5000 words a day which would get this huge goal done but I don't know if I have the discipline to do this.  We'll see.Renew my driver's license, military ID, and concealed carry permit.  All of these expire this year so I need to get them renewed.Do every single one of the scheduled walks this year with my walking group.  My local walking group does about 20 group walks a year (basically every other Saturday except in the summer).  But I am usually so lazy on Saturday mornings that getting up at 7am to meet up with the group means I only make it maybe a third of the time.  This year I want to force myself to do these walks which will both improve my health, improve my participation with the group, and help me hit my walking goal (#2 above).Do our family reunion.  For the last few years I have paid for our family reunion.  Usually about 40 to 50 people show up at a buffet in Portland to catch up with each other.  Most everyone is in my family is poor and even going to a buffet puts a strain on their finances so I am happy to pay for this event to get everyone together.  So while we may not show up this year (yeah Facetime), I still want to make it a point to organize and pay for this event.Visit all of the state parks in Nevada.  There are 26 state parks in Nevada and our parks system offers a free yearly pass to anyone who visits all of the parks and gets their \"parks passport\" stamped at each park.  This will require a few day trips and a few overnight trips to hit all of the parks (yeah camping) but this is something I have wanted to do for a long time and since this may be our only vacation this year I think it is a good goal.Limit social media to less than an hour a day.  Between Facebook and reddit I can kill HOURS each day.  And not only is social media a huge time suck, but I'm really tired of all of the politics, bad news, and arguing with random strangers on the internet that takes place on social media.  Plus if I am not on social media for hours each day I can use that time to accomplish my other goals listed above.Save $10,000 by the end of the year.  I make money, I spend money, and have minimal savings.  I want a nice comfortable financial cushion of non-emergency fund savings so this is another big financial goal but I am hoping to reach it anyway."},
{"title": "A Confession", "date": "Thursday, December 28, 2017", "text": "When I started this blog way back in 2009, I was in debt and wanted out.  I think I had just learned about Dave Ramsey and was inspired to be debt free for the first time ever in my life and his cash-only lifestyle really struck a chord with me.  So began this blog and some major changes in my life. Since then we were able to become totally debt free, we sold our house and nearly everything in it to travel for a while, then randomly ended up starting our retired life in Las Vegas.  A year or so after settling down again I pretty much wrapped up this blog as I had got to where I wanted to be--debt free and living cash only--and that would be the end of that.  So I thought.Fast forward to a couple of years ago.  Our car was getting old (about 16 years old at the time), it was breaking down pretty often (we were on a first name basis with every mechanic at our local car repair shop), and I figured I needed a new car.  So I bought one on credit, not with cash as Dave Ramsey always preaches.  After all, my freelance income had been pretty steady for some years and I figured it would be better to buy a car at 50 years old (with the ability to get an actual job if my freelance income should dry up than at, say, 60 when it may be harder to work).  And thus I was back in debt.  Then I felt like I needed to get my credit score up (it wasn't terrible, I was able to by a car after all, but it wasn't very high either) so I got a credit card after more than five years without one.  I also got 50,000 bonus miles!  But then I used the credit card.  And then I got another card and another.  Now I have six credit cards, four of which I never use but two of which I do use and often carry a balance on.Fortunately hubby is wiser than me and never carries any debt but my crappy spending habits from years ago are slowly creeping back into my life.  Even though I always pay my bills on time, I don't want to have bills.  I want to go back to where I had zero debt and never used credit.  I am hopping back on the cash-only living train starting now."},
{"title": "Wrapping Up 2017", "date": "Wednesday, December 27, 2017", "text": "2017 was a pretty blah year.  Between the new president :( social media being an overwhelmingly negative downer for the most part :( and just the general blah-ness of the year overall, I will be happy to put this year behind me.On a positive note, I was looking at all of my blogs and realized this blog which I pretty much wrapped up and set on the back burner a few years was still statistically active!  So with me needing to hop back on the cash only living train (more on that later) it will be my new year resolution to blog here every single day next year.As for the rest of this year (a whole five days) I will be physically wrapping up the year by deep cleaning the house (carpets were shampooed yesterday by yours truly), doing a bit of landscaping (easy enough to do when the weather is 65 degrees out!), cleaning out my closets, and otherwise getting ready to start the new year with a clean slate."},
{"title": "Merry Christmas!", "date": "Sunday, December 24, 2017", "text": "I hope you all have a very Merry Christmas!  After a quiet and stress-free Thanksgiving, we are jumping into the holidays with both feet--cooking (a lot!), enjoying three days of Christmas celebrations (the annual Christmas fish fry, the annual Christmas Eve dinner party, and the annual Christmas Day brunch and bowling tournament), and baking...so much baking.  One of my New Years resolutions is to blog here every single day of 2018 so you should be hearing a lot more from me soon!"},
{"title": "6 Useful Money Links", "date": "Sunday, December 3, 2017", "text": "In no particular order...Refinery29 takes an interesting look at how people spend their money in their Money Diaries section.  Very interesting!The deadline for open enrollment for the healthcare marketplace is December 15th!Most of my shopping is done at either the Goodwill (clothes) and everything else (online).  A great way to find bargains online is at DealNews.The cost of our internet recently went up.  The best deal they could give me was by adding basic cable TV which cost $60 per month for both (as opposed to $61 for internet only).  After not having cable for years, I was really disappointed in basic cable--it gave us about 15 stations total(!?!) plus HBO.  After a week of this, we switched back to our regular over-the-air antenna for TV which gives us 50+ stations and lots of great programming.  I stopped by our local cable office and told the guy how disappointed I was and he found be a better deal on internet only ($50).  The cable box goes back tomorrow.Even though December is super busy, here are a bunch of financial moves you might want to take advantage of before the end of the year.Reddit is a goldmine of information (and a huge time suck but I digress...).  One of my favorite sub reddits is personal finance.  Be sure to check the sidebar for related sub reddits to help you save even more money."},
{"title": "Happy Thanksgiving!", "date": "Thursday, November 23, 2017", "text": "I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving!  Hubby and I agreed that this year was our best Thanksgiving ever and I think that is because we bowed out from cooking for the masses and shared the holiday at home, just the two of us.  We have NEVER done this before.  For the 30+ years we have been together it is always a big holiday occasion and we usually end up cooking, even after moving to Las Vegas where the few cousins who live here multiply by the dozens around the holiday.  While we enjoy cooking, this year it was really enjoyable to watch the Macy's parade and make a quiet (and minimal) dinner.And since this is a money blog, I'll just point out that the entire dinner cost around $10, the secret being that we didn't need a huge turkey and in fact, I hardly eat meat at all and hubby isn't a fan of leftovers so we went to the grocery store deli and bought a few slices of 'carving board turkey' and this (cheaply) took care of the turkey part of the meal.Of course we finished up with pumpkin pie!"},
{"title": "20 (Cheap) Travel Tips", "date": "Friday, October 27, 2017", "text": "We just got back from a beautiful week in New England.  The leaves were beautiful (see above), the weather was beautiful (until the last day when it rained like crazy), and the food was beautiful (soooo much Italian food!!).  Here are some of the ways we stretch our travel dollars...I always find our air tickets through Google Flights.  This search engine allows me to search by price and by day so I can find the cheapest tickets for our (very flexible) vacation days.  Note that Southwest Air doesn't come up on this search engine so I usually search SW Air separately.I also look for alternate ways to get to where we are going.  If we can save $200 flying into New York instead of Providence, we will do this then take the subway/Metro North to our destination in Connecticut.We have also traveled by: Amtrak (OK), Greyhound (ick), Megabus (pretty good and cheap!), Bolt Bus (ditto), cruise ship, ferry, tourists bus, chicken bus, jeepney, tuk tuk, local Southeast Asian airline (the plane dated from WW2!)...basically we look at every travel option for cost, destination, ease of use, travel time, etc. and figure out what will best meet our needs.We don't check luggage because of the extra baggage fee.  We have refined the art of one-bag packing so everything we need fits into a carry-on sized backpack.  This greatly reduces travel hassle when you can easily carry everything you need with you.Some one-bagging tips: pack clothing that is dark and coordinates (this makes it easier to use fewer clothes to put together multiple outfits), plan on doing laundry once a week (either at a friend's house or local laundromat), bring less than you think you will need (you don't need seven pairs of pants for a seven day trip when three will work fine).  If worse comes to worst, you can always buy things you need at your destination!We bring our own food and snacks when we travel.  It's simple to run by a store wherever we are and pick up granola bars and other snacks to bring with us when we fly (and it's much cheaper than buying food on your flight or at the hotel gift shop--when I looked in the hotel gift shop and saw that two small candy bars cost $5 I nearly fainted!).We also bring our own water bottles on our flights.  Instead of going through security then paying top dollar for a bottle of water at the airport we just bring empty water bottles (I like Aquafina bottles because they are so sturdy) and fill them up at a water fountain after we pass the security check (I see many people doing this so it isn't a secret that this is a great way to save money).We usually stay with friends and family when we travel.  This is a great way to save on the sky-rocketing cost of hotels, visit with people we haven't seen in a while, and get a locals view of our travel destination.  Of course we always welcome friends and family to stay with us when they visit Las Vegas.We do take advantage of serendipitous lodging though.  During this past vacation my wonderful niece asked if we would like to stay in a casino hotel suite for five days.  For free.  We jumped on this opportunity and ended up in a $2300 a night suite which was amazing!People also use AirBnB to cut lodging costs and while we know several people who list their rooms/condos/houses on AirBnB, we haven't tried this yet (hubby is a bit creeped out about staying in a stranger's house).We look at ground transportation costs and decide which is most cost effective.  If it is just the two of us, we usually use public transit (city buses and subways).  We also use Uber if there is no nearby bus.  Cabs are a last (and expensive) resort.  On this vacation, since we were meeting up with other relatives, we all decided to split the cost of a rental car which was the cheapest, and most convenient, option overall.  Since we got into the rental place a bit late, instead of our cheap econo-rental car, the only cars they had left were Audi SUVs so we got a free upgrade!I always Google local sites and things to do then make a list of the things we want to experience while we are on vacation.  Many places have a lot of free and low cost things to do that many tourists overlook.  Chicago has a free zoo which is wonderful, Pike Place Market is free to wander around in Seattle, and I once hiked a short section of the Appalachian Trail which was also free!We do splurge occasionally.  What's the fun of travel and new experiences if you don't pay up for unique experiences that you can't get anywhere else?  I'd never had a lobster roll before and I wanted to try one this trip so off we went to one of the most famous lobster roll places in the state which happened to be nearby.  Now spending $18 for a lobster roll was IMHO ridiculous, but spend $18 we did because it was a new and unique experience for us.  tldr; I now know I can make these myself for a fraction of the cost!Free wifi is wonderful.  Our cell plan is really amazing--we get unlimited data plus free data and texting anywhere in the world which has worked great on previous international vacations (thanks TMobile) but sometimes I need faster internet so I always look for free wifi spots.  Fortunately they seem to be ubiquitous these days, unfortunately you need to take extra steps to protect yourself when using these free services.Have a budget and stick to it.  It's easy to splurge since you are \"on vacation\" but most of the things you find on vacation you either don't need (tourist tchotckes), can find cheaper at home (outlet malls draw millions of tourists but their prices are so high!), or will give you buyer's remorse almost immediately (cruise ship jewelry and art for starters).We generally carry cash (hidden) with us which keeps us on budget, as well as lots of small bills for tipping and spending on small purchases.Splurging on lobster rolls aside, we usually go local for our meals which saves a lot of money.  In tourists destinations famous steakhouses will separate you from your money quicker than nearly anything else but we can get steaks anywhere.  So we usually hit up a grocery store for breakfast items, then look for hole-in-the-wall places for lunch and dinner.  If the price is great and the restaurant is full of locals, that's where we eat.  Note we almost always split a meal which cuts a usual restaurant meal price in half as we both can't eat as much as we used to.For entertainment, aside from looking for free and cheap tourists activities, there are lots of free hobbies that I enjoy when we travel such as photographing graveyards, doing genealogy research, walking with local volksmarch groups, hiking and checking out local parks, etc.Speaking of hobbies, I've met many travelers who have free or relatively inexpensive travel hobbies like county collecting, national park stamp collecting (be sure to get an annual pass), MTP place collecting, walking, etc.And some random tips: use a fanny pack, it's uncool but super useful and secure; be nice to everyone even if you are having a crappy travel day as they are more likely to help nice people than mean people; put some acidophilous in your first aid kit, it fixes all kinds of stomach problems; don't be an Ugly American, try to fit in with the locals."},
{"title": "20 (Free) Ways to Prepare for a Disaster", "date": "Tuesday, October 10, 2017", "text": "There have been so many disasters lately!  From hurricanes to mass shootings to wildfires...it seems as if we have had a decade's worth of disasters all in the course of a year or so.  Here are some free ways to prepare for a disaster:Take advantage of any free classes offered in your community.  Many community organizations (fire departments, hospitals, Red Cross, etc) offer free classes in the community to teach skills that would be useful during a disaster such as first aid, AED, CPR, earthquake preparedness, hurricane preparedness, and other similar classes.  Take advantage of free disaster preparedness item giveaways in your community.  Again, community organizations often offer free things to help avert a disaster like the fire department giving away free smoke detectors, the hospital giving free child car seats to new parents, the county offering free home earthquake preparedness evaluations for your home, etc.Develop a communication plan with your family.  If you are separated from your family during a disaster, it is a good idea to pre-plan a couple of friends or family members everyone can call to report that they are OK.  Sometimes phone calls and texts don't go through in the immediate area of a disaster so it is useful to call a family contact who lives outside of the disaster area to check in and relay messages to family members.Back up all of your important documents and pictures onto your computer and from your computer to a thumb drive.  Instead of evacuating with boxes and boxes of pictures and documents, you can ensure you have all of these important items on one small thumb drive.  If you don't have a scanner, libraries often have free scanners you can use to do this.Make an evacuation plan.  In case you are given a few hours to grab what you can and go, you need to have an evacuation plan already in place so you will know the best routes to leave your area.  Check out Google maps or other map programs on your computer and determine the best ways to leave your area.  Then drive these routes and check out anything that may make these routes inaccessible during a disaster (like overpasses that could crumble onto the roadway during and earthquake).  Part of your evacuation plan should also be also be a checklist of items you need to toss in the car at the last minute so you don't forget anything important when you leave.Utilize the free resources of the internet to prepare for a disaster.  Find out what kinds of disasters are most likely in your area.  Read various websites to determine the best way to prepare for these likely disasters.  Google around and see if there are any preparedness classes in your area.  Read news articles about how people who have already went through such a disaster prepared and survived and take notes.Attend community events that focus on preparedness.  Our city often has free vaccination clinics, preparedness fairs, fire department tours, and other events to show community members what types of resources are available in the city and provide disaster preparedness resources to help citizens prepare for a disaster.Carry things in your car that could be used during a disaster.  We always have a spare blanket in our car, a case of bottled water, some granola bars, a basic first aid kit, some spare tools from our workshop, etc.  All of which would be useful during a disaster.Download apps to your cell phone which would be useful during a disaster.  From Facebook to reddit to local news apps to weather apps to emergency alert apps to a Waze app...there are dozens and dozens of free apps that can help you during an emergency.Use social media to your advantage during an emergency.  If you need help or information during an emergency, you can follow various social media accounts on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/etc that you can use to ask questions, ask for help, and receive important information (during the shooting in Las Vegas I got a lot of information from the police Facebook and Twitter accounts, I asked questions from our local Emergency Incident Facebook page, and messages for donations of food and water for the first responders and shooting victims were sent far and wide over social media).Know what to expect (and what to do) during a disaster by reading your work's disaster plan as well as your kid's school's disaster plan.  For further reading you can also read your community's official disaster and mass casualty incident plans.Learn how to handle basic disasters in your home.  Everyone should know how and when to turn off the natural gas line to your home as well as the main electricity breaker and the water main coming into your home.  Everyone should know how to evacuate your home from each room, both upstairs and down, what to do if there is a fire, what to do if there is a medical emergency, and how to prevent break ins and thefts from your home.Be physically fit.  This can be as simple as good food choices and some daily exercise and stretching.  If a disaster happens where you need to haul yourself out of an upstairs window, run from an attacker, or duck and cover during an earthquake, all of these things are easier and safer to do if you are in good physical condition.Determine ahead of time where you can evacuate to if needed.  Ideally you will have friends or family you can stay with across town, across the state, and across the country depending on how wide-spread the disaster is.  Of course you would offer the same shelter to your friends and relatives in return as part of their evacuation plan.Always carry a useful EDC (everyday carry) bag.  For ladies it's our purses for men it might be a backpack or messenger bag.  There are a lot of things you can carry with you on a daily basis that would be useful during a disaster such as a tampon (for its usual purpose as well as stopping bleeding from a gun shot), a condom (for its usual purpose as well as for a make-shift tourniquet), bottle of water, matches, bandanna, etc.Make a bug out bag.  A bug out bag is a backpack full of useful items that you can grab and take with you during an emergency.  It should include a change of clothes, toiletries, emergency supplies (tarp, para cord, matches, etc), some cash, a couple bottles of water, some food...basically everything you would need if you had to evacuate and go stay at a hotel for a few days.  With the bag already packed and ready to go, you don't need to put such a bag together when you are only given minutes to evacuate.Volunteer in your community.  There are many community organizations that provide free training (and often free food and snacks!) to volunteers who help out by becoming a volunteer EMT, volunteer with the Red Cross or Search and Rescue, volunteer with the fire department or hospital, etc.Know what services are available in your community during and after a disaster.  Where are your local disaster shelters?  What services will FEMA offer after a disaster?  Did you know the FBI, as well as many communities, have a crime victims assistance center which offers a range of services and help to victims of crime?Do some things to earn money to help bulk up your emergency fund.  Have a garage sale, take in some recycling, sell some unneeded stuff on ebay, apply for class action refunds...any extra money you can earn can go into your emergency fund for use during a disaster.Decide ahead of time how to help special needs family members during a disaster.  If anyone in your family needs prescription meds, see if they can get 90-day refills instead of 30-day refills so they always have extra medication on hand.  If you have pets, pack a bug out bag for them with extra pet food, a water dish, a blanket, etc.  Same with babies and toddlers; pack their bug out bags with any special items they may need (extra diapers, toys, etc).  For family members with serious medical issues, talk to their doctor about what they should do to prepare for a disaster (ie: people who need regular dialysis, people who are bed-ridden, etc)."},

{"title": "Need Gear? Check Out the Goodwill", "date": "Tuesday, September 19, 2017", "text": "Last month I needed some new stuff for walking (stretchy athletic pants and a cute top to go with it) so I went to a local department store and got some \"sale\" items.  I spent $30 for a pair of Nike athletic pants and a store brand top.  I hadn't shopped for clothes at a regular store in years but I was in a hurry and the store was on the way and, long story short, never again.  The pants are already wearing as is the shirt and I am NOT HAPPY about it.  So it was back to the Goodwill I went this week.While I always buy my shoes, socks, underwear, and backpacks brand new (but still on clearance, always), I have no problem buying clothes--pants and tops--at thrift stores.  I know exactly how they will fit as they have already been washed several times, I know exactly how they will wear because if they haven't unraveled after someone else wore them they should last for me as well, and, most importantly, people get rid of really good brands and the thrift stores sell them for a fraction of the price of new (the pants I bought at the regular store for $24 would have been less than $8!).Here's some great deals I found a couple of days ago at the Goodwill...an REI rain jacket, a fluorescent yellow shirt for an upcoming fun run, and an Eddie Bauer vest, all for under $5 each with a senior discount."},
{"title": "Volksmarching...A Fun and Inexpensive Hobby", "date": "Saturday, September 16, 2017", "text": "I've probably posted here before about one of my favorite hobbies but it has been so long I figured I would post about it again.  I love to walk.  Short walks, long walks, winter walks, summer walks...all are fun.  Anyway, today I headed out for another volksmarch (I'm trying to finish 100 volksmarches by the end of the year to win an award).  It was a great day for walking and there were so many people out in the early AM walking this morning!  If you haven't heard of it, volksmarching in a German-inspired walking club in the US and in many other parts of the world.  The annual cost to join a local club is around $15 and you pay $3 for each walk which supports the club and pays for small awards like patches and pins.  You earn awards for both the number of events you walk as well as achieving walking distances (I met one guy who has walked more than 50,000 km over the years and he is still going!). As hobbies go, this is a pretty good one as it is both inexpensive and good for your health (each walk is a 5k or 10k with some as long as 42k).  The only thing you really need is a good pair of shoes but of course people who really get into walking can make it a much more expensive hobby by traveling to various walking events.  One couple I met walks more than 300 volksmarches a year, driving around the country to do this; they spend about 270 days on the road each year to hit A LOT of volksmarches.  A related walking club hosts a dozen walking weekend events all over the world which can get spendy if you are hopping from country to country each month to walk in these events.Most cities and towns in the US have volksmarch events (either group walks or boxes where you can sign up and walk on your own).  My city has ten organized walks as well as a couple of special events each year.  The people who put these walks together really do a great job highlighting the best things to see in the area along your walk (some of our local walks go through the casinos along the Las Vegas Strip, other go out to Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam).So if you are looking for a fun, enjoyable, and no so expensive hobby, check out volksmarching.  The US Club can be found here, the Canadian Club here, and an international club here."},

{"title": "12 Cheap Tricks for Disaster Preparedness", "date": "Tuesday, September 12, 2017", "text": "Like most of the nation I was glued to the TV watching the hurricane disasters unfold, first in Houston then in Florida.  While many of the people caught in the disaster areas were prepared (yeah Cajun Navy!), many others weren't as prepared.  Those were the people crowding into almost empty stores, hours before the hurricanes hit, arguing over the last case of water or gallon of milk.  Here are some inexpensive ways to prepare for a disaster:Shop loss leaders and use coupons.  We recently bought a case of water for 99 cents with a coupon at our local grocery store (24 bottles of water for the price of one an a convenience store!) and a case of canned soup for $8.  Milk is often a loss leader (and can be frozen), and the Dollar Store has lots of canned and shelf-stable items that can be eaten during a disaster.  Just remember to rotate your stored food and/or donate the stuff you don't eat before it expires to a food bank then restock again.You can buy a fancy first aid kit full of items you may never use or you can make your own for cheap.  Again the dollar store, Walmart, even Amazon can provide individual items for your first aid kit for very inexpensive prices (100 bandaids for $1, a box of alcohol wipes for $1, aspirin and Tylenol on sale, etc).  You can Google a list of first aid kit items such as this one.Empty the change in your pockets into a jar (roll and exchange for cash as it adds up), add random bits of cash to the jar, stick unexpected money in the jar (like birthday gift money, rebate checks, etc)...eventually you will have a good bit of cash to use during an emergency.If you have a way to store gasoline (such as in your boat, or in containers to use in your lawn equipment), do so.  Many people who were trying to evacuate found that gas stations were out of gas so having extra on hand and topping off your tank at home is a good way to ensure you can actually evacuate if you need to even if there is no gas to be found in your area.  Remember to rotate your stored gasoline so it doesn't deteriorate.If camping or backpacking is your usual hobby, you will be extra prepared for a disaster.  Your camping/backpacking gear (stove, tent, sleeping bag, etc) is a boon when it comes to needing to evacuate or live outside of your home due to damage.  Note that you can get great quality outdoor equipment for cheap during REI sales, at www.steepandcheap.com, at Amazon and even at Walmart and Target.A great place to find low-cost disaster gear--everything from wool clothing and work gloves to work boots and cast iron cookware--is at the Goodwill or other thrift stores.  I mean you can pay top dollar for this sort of stuff but so many of these things get donated that it pays to be patient and pick up things you can for a fraction of the price of new.Buy things for your home that can do double duty.  A patio gas grill is great for summer parties but it is also an excellent place to cook when the power/gas is out to your kitchen stove during a disaster.  We buy $1 plastic tarps at the Dollar Store to have on hand and they can be used for everything from paint drop clothes to covering outdoor equipment during a storm to pitching a tent with during a disaster.  And those solar patio lights that you have outside can be brought in during the evening to provide light when the power is out.If you want some excellent free training that will be useful during a disaster, volunteer in your community.  EMTs, Red Cross volunteers, Search and Rescue volunteers, CERT team members--there are many community organizations that provide free disaster-skills training to their volunteers.If you have ever had the power go out for a while, you know that the family usually gets that \"now what am I supposed to do look\" as they try in vain to get their non-responsive electronic gadgets to work.  Buying a car charger for your cell phone and gadgets is a good idea as is having board games and books on hand to keep people entertained during long power outages.Think long and hard about buying expensive disaster equipment.  Based on where you live, having a chainsaw on hand can be super useful or not useful at all (we don't have big trees here in Las Vegas so we don't need a chainsaw; my sister, on the other hand, has so many huge trees on her property that without a chainsaw they could be stuck at home for days if they don't have a way to remove the trees that fall across her driveway themselves).  Ditto generators.  We don't have disasters here where we can expect the power to be out for a long time, but our family in New England often get power outages during the winter that can last for a week or longer so all of them have generators.Put together a list of disaster supplies that you need and add to your supplies a little each week.  Buying all of these items at once can be a financial hardship for many but if you pick up a couple of things each week (box of wooden matches and a couple of lighters this week, a tarp and flashlight next week, etc) you will eventually end up with a very comprehensive disaster supply cache with minimal financial impact since the things are bought over a long period of time.Knowledge is free and knowledge is probably the most important thing to have during a disaster.  Hit up your local library and do some research online and learn as much as you can about what to do during a disaster.  Basic first aid skills, how to pitch a tent in the back yard, how to start a fire with a myriad of household items, how to survive a financial disaster, what to do before, during and after a hurricane...there are hundreds and hundreds of survival skills that you can learn to be better prepared for a disaster in the future.The bottom line is that you shouldn't have to race to the store hours before a disaster is set to strike and spend thousands of dollars on over-priced emergency supplies.  Start today to build you disaster supplies cache, a little at a time, as the items come on sale, and you will be all set when--not if--disaster strikes your area."},
{"title": "How I Saved $155 on a Car Key", "date": "Sunday, September 10, 2017", "text": "A while back hubby lost his keys.  It would have been no big deal, except for the time it would take to get some keys copied, but one of the keys he lost was to his van and this key is one of those electronic-transponder keys (read very expensive to replace).  I called a car locksmith and the verdict was $180 for them to make a new car key.  Ugh.But this being 2017, I went hunting (online, not like really hunting) for a DIY way to replace the key mostly to save money because $180 for a key is ridiculous.  I found several websites that said it was totally possible to make your own transponder car key so I:Went to Amazon and found the key blanks for sale.  I made sure the keys had a lot of good reviews so that I knew it was at least possible this would actually work.  Total cost for keys $10 for two.Got the keys in the mail and took them to a big box store and asked then to cut the key by copying my original key to the van.  The guy said he couldn't do it because the key had a transponder in it.  I was bummed.I then went across the road to a home improvement store.  The guy there said they didn't usually cut car keys but on the screen he could opt for \"no transponder\" and it would copy the key but they wouldn't be responsible if it didn't work.  I was more than happy to agree as at least the key would fit into the ignition and it if didn't work I would only be out $15 total so it was worth a shot.  Total cost to get the keys cut $5.I took the keys home and quickly programmed them following the instructions that came with the keys (basically put in the original key, turn the car on and off, insert the new key and wait 30 seconds then try to turn it on).And it worked!!!  I quickly programmed both new keys and they have worked without any issues since.Total saved: $155!This is our old table and chairs.  They were given to us when we first moved to Las Vegas and as you can see, they don't even match.  A nice table cloth kind of covered up the fact that the table and chairs didn't match but when it came time to get a new dining set I went about trying to sell this set...and learned a Craigslist lesson.First I listed the table and chairs together for $100.  Not a single person called about it.  Then I lowered the price to $75 for the set and again, not a single call.  So I got the bright idea to list them separately and you know what?  They sold immediately!  Not only did they sell quickly but they sold for nearly the initial price that I wanted--the table sold for $40 and the chairs for $50.  Reselling people probably would have probably already thought about this but it was kind of an eye-opening idea for me."},

{"title": "Blog Wrap Up: A Whole Bunch of Frugal Tips (Part 3 of 5)", "date": "Monday, June 23, 2014", "text": "As I discussed in my last post, the main way that we were able to dig out of debt was to go cash-only.  The way we were able to go cash-only was to considerably lower our everyday expenses.  If we hadn't also gone frugal, we would have certainly ran out of cash before we ran out of things to buy.  Here, in no particular order, are all of the frugal habits that we regularly use:We don't have cable TV; we bought digital over-the-air antennas for each TV.  For about $20 each, we will have free TV for life.We pay cash for our cell phones (usually on Amazon, sometimes at Walmart, and once on sale on the TMobile website).  Buying a cell phone over two years on a contract through the cell provider is the most expensive way to buy a cell phone.We each have the $30 TMobile cell phone plan through Walmart (1500 talk/text minutes and a little data for hubby, unlimited text and internet with 100 talk minutes for me).Because I often need to call in for meetings, I have a monthly plan through Skype for $2.95 for unlimited calling and $3.95 a month for a Skype phone number.We buy almost everything we need at the $1 store and the 99 cent store.  If we must buy something these stores we don't have, we go to Walmart (ie: I haven't bought make up at Macys for years...the cheap stuff at Walmart works just as well and recently I found that the $1 nail polish works just as well as the more expensive brands).I haven't shopped at a mall in years.  We buy all of our clothes, home decor, etc. at the Goodwill.We have recently started shopping at the Goodwill outlet which offers even better prices on clothes and other goods.For things we don't want to buy used, like underwear and shoes, we shop the clearance sales at Ross and TJ Maxx.Hubby makes his own coffee at home each morning in a $10 drip coffee maker.  No Starbucks, no Keurig...just basic, cheap, and tasty coffee for pennies a cup.We use half of the recommend amount of many things (ie: cut dryer sheets in half, use half the amount of laundry soap, half the usual amount of toothpaste, half the usual amount of shampoo, etc.  Obviously I don't recommend half the amount of medication since that is a whole other ball game).I clean our house each week (no more housekeeper).We also do our own (minimal) landscaping (no more yard guy either).We don't buy items that need to be dry cleaned (this is an added expense that we don't need).We hem pants that are too long, mend clothes that need repairs, iron our clothes before each wearing...basically do all of our own laundry service to keep what we wear looking good.We have minimal items in our bathrooms--soap, razor, shampoo, and hair conditioner in the shower (as opposed to a friend who has three kinds of soap, a product for shaving, a half dozen hair products, etc).We keep the heat down in the winter (and wear sweaters around the house, watch TV with blankets over us, etc).We keep the air conditioner up in the summer (we easily tolerate the AC set at 78 degrees).  We also use ceiling fans to keep the house cool as well as drawing the shades during the heat of the day.Instead of cable TV, we have a subscription to Netflix to keep hubby entertained.We use our library to get lots of free things--books, music, classes, a bajillion free Kindle books to read, etc.Everywhere we go I ask for discounts.  We get locals discounts (a common thing in Las Vegas), senior discounts (for hubby) and veteran's discounts (also for hubby).We get a big break on our annual car registration fee because our county offers this sort of discount to veterans just for filling out a form.We don't have vices.  Well, hubby uses his minimal monthly allowance to play poker but we don't drink, smoke, do drugs, etc.  I pay almost all of our bills online which saves the cost of stamps.All of our bank accounts are free of any charges (two credit unions and one bank which gave us a free bank account because they hold our mortgage).We are a one car family.  And this one car was paid for in cash and will be driven until it literally dies.I often walk to do errands and shopping.  This not only saves gas but it is also good exercise.I call our cable internet company every time our cable rate is set to go up and ask for a discount (this has worked well so far).When I saw that our car insurance rates were always going up, I shopped around and threatened to change companies unless ours could give us a better rate...and they did.We dropped full coverage insurance on our car and only have liability since the car is old and we would only get a few thousand for the car should it be totaled.I raised the deductible on our house insurance which lowered the cost of this insurance.We pay some of our bills (sewer, car and house insurance) annually or bi-annually which gives us a small discount over paying these bills monthly.We buy quality items that last longer and stay in style longer rather than buying less expensive trendy items that are cheaply made and go out of style quicker (like shoes.  I like quality shoes such as Keens or Clarks or Brooks but I still buy them at a good discount at TJ Maxx and Ross).We group all of our errands together which saves gas.We also try to stay home a couple days each week which also saves gas and keeps us from spending money.We buy store brand products instead of name brand products (like Equate hair gel, Equate dandruff shampoo, Equate hand lotion).We take advantage of hubby's military benefits (shopping at the commissary, my super inexpensive health insurance, etc).We get our hair cut at the cheap Great Clips place instead of an expensive salon.To make my haircuts last longer, hubby trims my hair between cuts which means I only need to pay for about four haircuts a year.I do my own manicures, pedicures, waxing, and hair coloring.When we color our hair, we only mix half of the product and save half of the hair dye for the next time (we each have short hair so half of the hair dye works fine for our hair.  Just don't mix the product together and save it as this won't work).We have inexpensive pets (gold fish.  And hubby cleans and reuses their filters to extend the cost of these filters).We also have inexpensive hobbies (I like walking, hubby participates in a few inexpensive bowling leagues--he also happens to be a great bowler so at the end of the season he always wins more in award money than he spends on the weekly fees).Since hubby is a senior, he paid $10 for a lifetime National Parks Pass which we use often.There is so much free entertainment in Las Vegas that nearly all of our entertainment is free (free movies, free guided hikes, free rodeos, free community events like parades and art shows, etc).We are also members of House Seats (for a flat $89 fee, we can attend a myriad of Vegas shows, every day if we are so inclined, for two years!).Hubby uses his monthly allowance to play poker.  When he plays poker he gets comps for free meals so any time we want to eat out, it is free.Hubby also plays free poker online and through this he wins prizes such as $50 restaurant gift certificates and free rooms at local hotels.We shop loss leaders at the grocery store and make our meals based on what is on sale.Unless we are eating our free with hubby's comps, we cook almost all of our meals at home.We make much of our food at home from scratch (it's super simple to make yogurt, pizza, baked goods, etc).Using a whole paper towel is wasteful so hubby cuts the roll of paper towels down the middle so we only use half a paper towel at a time.We use basic cleaning products (bleach, ammonia, vinegar, scouring powder...and a lot of rags instead of disposable cleaning products).The SIL gave us a Swiffer but when it ran out of disposable Swiffer pads, I just made my own out of rags.When we host parties, we also do all of the cooking (it's cheaper and tastier than catered).When we attend dinners with friends, I always bring baked goods, etc. instead of purchasing items to bring.We moved to an area with a much lower cost of living (this saves us an inordinate amount of money).Hubby likes a certain kind of cologne so we found a place to buy it cheaper than retail (at the military exchange store) and he uses less of it (it used to be six sprays each morning, now he is down to two...this really stretches out the product to the tune of 1.5 years between purchases instead of every six months).When items come on sale we stock up (like right now all of our closets are full of toilet paper because the commissary had it on sale for a third of its regular price.  Ditto for pork that we found on sale for 99 cents a pound).We occasionally use coupons on items we purchase but it needs to be items that we would have bought anyway.When we know we will be away from home during a meal, we make sandwiches and take them with us.On occasions when we are out at meal time and didn't bring food with us, we hit up a fast food place and eat off the $1 menu only (this tides us over until we get home for a very cheap price).When we do eat out, even with hubby's comps which get us free meals, we almost always order one meal and share it since restaurant portions are so huge.We purposely bought a small house when we moved (this saves on heating and air conditioning costs, cleaning time, decorating costs, etc).When we first moved to our new place, we recorded our electricity usage daily and worked on ways to reduce our electricity costs to save money (ie: keeping the air conditioning on low 24/7 uses a massive amount of electricity so now when we leave the house we set it on 82 then lower it down when we get home).We shop for things on Craigslist rather than buying new (ie: we couldn't find a treadmill at the Goodwill so we checked Craigslist and bought a barely used one for $50).We only shop the Goodwill on Wednesdays because it's half off for seniors on that day.Whenever we have a problem, we try to Google the problem and fix it ourselves (so far we have fixed a dripping shower, a dead microwave, and a clothes dryer that kept shutting off...the parts for these repairs were pretty cheap and the labor, of course, was free).We don't go to the stores unless there is something we absolutely need to buy (just wandering around stores aimlessly makes us buy stuff we don't really need).The hubby and I debate nearly every purchase from what kind of tortilla chips to buy (I have a favorite brand at the 99 cent store) to what kind of computer to buy (hubby tested out a new one, didn't like it, and promptly decided to live with his old one until something better than Windows 8 comes out).  Basically we start with \"do we need this\" and if the answer is yes, we move on to \"which is the best deal for our money, what features do we really need and really don't need\", etc.I pull our free credit reports each year and review it for mistakes (instead of paying a credit company to do this for us).I also do our taxes online at H and R Block for a super reasonable fee (this has turned out to be more accurate than me doing them by hand).I Googled each of our utilities to see what kind of freebies and deals they offered and have received everything from free shower heads and faucet aerators to rebate coupons and home weatherization materials.We buy some things in bulk (like 50 pound bags of rice which we know won't go to waste).We only use free apps on our tablets and cell phones and free software on our computers (there is so much good free stuff out there you really don't need to pay for these things).We let people know we like hand-me-downs and used stuff (when we moved in to our new house we were inundated with free, used furniture, appliances, curtains, clothes, decor, and other stuff from the cousins who had lots of used stuff in their garages that they didn't want any longer).We hit up Asian and Hispanic markets for specialized items that cost and arm and a leg at regular grocery stores (like coconut milk, special cuts of meat, produce, and ingredients for Asian recipes).We wash all of our laundry in cold water.We don't use the dishwasher, choosing instead to wash dishes by hand (this is quick and easy as there are only two of us).When we travel we do it as cheaply as possible (taking Megabus, getting day passes for the local transit system, staying at friends and relatives homes, watching for cheap airfares, etc).We've severely cut back gift giving (when the immediate family expanded past 100 people we pretty much stopped gift giving all together, choosing instead to send cash to the kids to spend on their families for holidays).We keep our car in good repair (check the tires often, regular oil changes, etc). We clean filters regularly (the filter on the clothes dryer, the filter on our HVAC system in our home, the air filter in the car, etc...this prolongs the life of the items).We don't buy extended warranties (we do make sure the product is of good quality, has good reviews and has a reasonable manufacturers warranty).We look for ways to minimize our bills (at the start of each year we review our list of bills to see if there is a way to reduce it--like cutting down the amount of garbage pick ups we get--or get rid of it all together--like cancelling subscriptions).We pay attention to postage rates (when we do consider sending gifts or packages to friends or family the first thing we look at is the cost of shipping...flat rate boxes are usually the way to go).We eat leftovers and never waste food (when hubby cooks Filipino food he usually brings the leftovers to the cousins who love this or to Filipino staff where he plays poker.  We have also \"adopted\" a homeless guy we pass on a road near our house and often bring him leftovers, extra clothes we don't need, etc).We get rid of things we don't truly need (we haven't had a land line phone in ages, we ditched the gym membership in favor of free exercise activities, we no longer subscribe to newspapers or magazines, etc).We pay cash for gas for the car and choose the cheapest gas station in our area (Arco). Hubby also tracks our gas expenses so we can tell when we are driving too much (which means we aren't being careful to group our errands enough).We wear our clothing two or three times between washing (they don't get dirty and this saves the expense of washing and drying them plus wear and tear on the clothes).When we need to make a bigger purchases, we compare prices, read reviews, find out about price matching, basically we do everything we can to get the lowest possible price on the items we buy.Whenever I buy something online, I Google the coupon or promo code for the item.  If there is a place that says \"promo code\" that means there is probably a promo code to be found for it which can often be found online. We try to be patient in order to save money.  This might mean watching the sale ads until the item we want is on a good enough sale to warrant buying it.  This also means instead of picking up a cell phone cover for $20 at the local store because I want it now, I buy it on Amazon for $2 and wait a couple of weeks until it is delivered.We look for a cheaper way to do the things that we want to do.  If we want to go to a movie (this is rare) we choose senior day or matinees over the cost of a full-priced movie (or better yet, we wait until the library gets it).  Ditto for checking out a new restaurant--we will go for lunch which is cheaper instead of dinner which is more expensive.When we purchase items with cash, or buy a bulk of items, we will ask for a discount (this often works).We avoid fees like the plague (ATM fees, credit card interest fees, monthly payment fees for some bills, etc).We don't bounce checks (and the one time that hubby accidentally did this because he wrote a check on an account that we rarely used and had very little money in, he immediately called the bank and asked for the fee to be waived which they did).We help people when needed and ask for help when needed (ie: when the cousin needed a new hot water tank we immediately took her around to the stores and helped her get the best deal; when we needed a ride to the airport she happily picked us up and dropped us off).I read everything.  By doing this I have: found great tips for freebies on reddit, found out that Saturdays are 10% off for military folks at our local grocery store, got a great deal on House Seats, filed for a class action rebate on a product that I regularly used, etc.We retired.  Oddly enough, even though we have less money, we also have considerably less expenses (no second car, no business wardrobe, no business lunches, etc).And 10 things we don't do (but other people do find frugal and useful):I don't hang our clothes out to dry.  Yes it saves money but the clothes are so crunchy!I don't have a monthly bus pass.  In Seattle this is a great way to get about and save money but the transit system in Vegas isn't that great.I don't grow my own food.  I tried this and it was a fail (not sure if it was me or trying to garden in 100+ degree heat).We don't have kids at home as they are all grown and self supporting (you wouldn't believe how much money this saves!).I don't make my own laundry soap (although I should definitely give this a try).I'm not a coupon queen (as much as I like free and cheap stuff I don't want to spend the time/reserve the storage space for massive couponing binges).I haven't cut out every vice (my particular expensive vice is a weekly trip to Baskin Robbins for a Capuccino Blast.  It would save me money not to do this but I like this weekly treat too much to give it up).I don't rewash and reuse plastic bags.  Many people do but...ick.We don't have pets.  Many people do and this is an added expense but we are hardly ever home and it is hard enough to find a fish sitter when we go on vacation.By luck or circumstance we haven't been in situations that can cause a financial catastrophe (like getting divorced, becoming a single parent, having a major medical catastrophe without insurance, co-signing for a loan that is defaulted on and comes back to us to pay, paying for bail or lawyers, having massive student loan debt...you get the idea)."},
{"title": "Blog Wrap Up: How to Get Out of Debt (Part 2 of 5)", "date": "Saturday, June 21, 2014", "text": "The whole purpose of this blog was to help me get out of debt (actually at the beginning I had no idea what the purpose of the blog would be, I was just so frustrated with being in debt I needed a place to whine...fortunately I ended up with a lot of supportive people leaving me comments which was super nice and, reading their blogs, super inspirational!).  This was how we ended up getting out of debt:We listened to Dave Ramsey for two hours each day for a good year.  Hubby got fairly sick of Dave Ramsey but his common sense advice--and the repetitiveness of it day after day--eventually planted itself into our subconscious.  He was the first person to say that people didn't have to live with debt--I literally never even thought that was possible as everyone I knew lived with debt.We stopped worrying about what everyone else thought.  For most of our life, we didn't want to be weird (Dave Ramsey gives you permission to be weird and not normal because normal people are broke) but we found that even though we were doing odd things (like riding the city bus and dropping cable) people were really more preoccupied with themselves and barely noticed the things we did.  Plus, at the time, many of the people who we thought would judge us if we didn't keep up with the Joneses, were losing their jobs, going bankrupt, etc.We were brave enough to experiment with many things.  It hit me when we hopped on a city bus in Mexico.  We were on vacation and our usual MO was to ride the city buses around whatever city we were in to get a feel for the area and then I wondered why I was so happy to ride a city bus in a foreign city but had never even considered riding the bus in my own city.  So I left my car at home and tried out our city bus when we got home.  I loved it!  I could arrive at my destination after reading a book or listening to music instead of dodging traffic plus it was literally $1000 a month cheaper than paying my car payment, insurance, gas, maintenance, etc.  Holy cow!  So the minute my car's lease was up it went back to the car company and we were instantly a one car family.  Our schedules were pretty flexible anyway and we shared the car often.  Plus I carpooled with co-workers to meetings and got a monthly bus pass for other times and the world didn't come to a halt at my audacious behavior.  Instead, we learned that by daring to experiment, we could save A LOT of money.We cut up our credit cards and went cash only.  If there is one thing that strikes fear into the heart of a shopper (other than the moment when the clerk goes to swipe your credit card and you don't quite know if it will be approved or not) it is not having any credit cards at all.  But we took Dave Ramsey's advice and cut up our credit cards and went cash only (not even using our checking accounts for a while because we were forever over-drafting our accounts).  It's really hard to over spend when you are living cash-only.  When the cash runs out, you are simply done shopping.We also, as Dave suggested, put together a $1000 emergency fund.  We sold stuff on eBay and Craigslist, had garage sales, sold gold, etc. in order to get the money for the emergency fund and this money, since we had cancelled our credit cards, was our only source of funds for an emergency.  When we were using credit cards for emergencies, it was easy to justify a great shoe sale as an \"emergency\".  When we had a limited amount of money for emergencies, we couldn't use it for anything other than legitimate emergencies (and there were a few times where this money really saved us!).Then we listed our debts, smallest to largest, and made it our mission in life to pay off our debts ASAP.  It was a slow go but slowly but surely our debts got paid off one by one.  To do this we were throwing every single extra dollar at the debts, having garage sales, doing extra work, anything to get the next debt paid off as soon as possible.When circumstances changed, we changed.  For years and years were were an upper middle class family with good jobs and good incomes (and lots of debt to show for it because we wanted to \"look\" successful.  Obviously there is a big difference between \"looking\" successful and \"being\" successful).  But then a bunch of events happened...hubby fully retired, house prices were sliding, I lost my biggest client...and we had to decide what to do.  We could have scrambled and tried to maintain appearances and hoped that the economy would turn around so we could maintain our \"normal\" lifestyle or we could make a drastic change.  We decided on the drastic change.  We sold our house while we could still got some equity out of it, we sold nearly everything we owned in a massive succession of garage sales and a flurry of Craigslist ads, we paid off our remaining debts, and then, rather than jumping into another similar lifestyle, we decided to be vagabonds for a while.  We traveled for a year and a half (very easy to do, even with both of us living on hubby's small pension, when the only debt we had was a small storage locker fee and monthly prepaid cell phone bills!) then we wound up in Las Vegas for a poker tournament and ended up buying a house and settling there (fortunately the Vegas housing market was pretty near its low point and we got a great deal on a newish house).Since then we have been happily living as retirees in Las Vegas.  We live frugally on hubby's pension and social security and my random income (mostly freelance work and a very cool seasonal job) and we no longer worry about debt.  We don't live above our means any more and we debate spending money on even the smallest things (a habit we developed when we were getting out of debt.  Just a few days ago we were out shopping and getting hungry, I said lets just go to the Chinese place but the prices were $6.99 per person which hubby said was too much so we drove a bit further and ended up sharing a pizza lunch special for $5 total...that's just how we roll these days).The moral of this story...if ten years ago someone would have told me we would be debt free and both of us retired before I turned 45 I would have laughed them out of the room.  We were so deep in debt (complete with creditors calling us daily and the IRS sending us letters weekly) that I thought I would be working until I was 90 but by using the free advice that is out there (mostly Dave Ramsey but there are a lot of inspirational blogs and websites out there as well) and making significant changes in our lifestyle and our attitudes, we were able to not only get out of debt, but completely change our lives."},
{"title": "Blog Wrap Up: From Beginning to End (Part 1 of 5)", "date": "Thursday, June 19, 2014", "text": "I've come to the point where I have decided to discontinue this blog.  I have come full circle (kind of, not really, as I got off the 360 full-circle loop on a way more positive place than where I began) and although I used cash only living for the past few years, I am actually now a full fledged credit card using, credit card holding member of society these days.  But going cash only did serve its purpose and got us out of debt, a fact which I will forever be grateful for.Looking back over this blog, it really is amazing to see where we began and how far we've come and where we ended up (Vegas baby!).  Seriously, if someone would have told me ten years ago that I would be debt free and living in Las Vegas I would have laughed them out of the room. I started this blog in a fit of angst on October 17, 2009.  At the time I wanted a new life that didn't include debt (the first post is here) and then I set some goals (found here in the second post).  I am happy to report that since those first two posts, nearly all of the goals I set have been met.  Who would have thought that the goals that I set nearly five years ago would have been achieved, often in such an unusual way?  Although we never did pay cash for a new car (we are still driving our old but trusty, paid off van) we did pay off the house and the home equity loan (by selling the house which wasn't even in the plans when I wrote the list), we paid off all of our credit cards, set up an emergency fund, and did get to travel, travel, travel (after selling the house and nearly everything we owned, we vagabonded our way around the country and through Asia before serendipitously stopping by Las Vegas so hubby could play in a poker tournament).  We ended up buying a newish house, for a quarter of the price of our previous house, just ten minutes from the Las Vegas Strip. We are now happily retired, living on a small fixed income (with some occasional jobs and freelance work thrown in for extra cash), and enjoying every day doing interesting and exciting things in our new city.  The frugal measures we used to dig ourselves out of debt are now ingrained habits and I am happy to report that we haven't been on the IRS's speed dial list in years (in fact we have been happily receiving annual tax refunds for the past few years which I am always thrilled about).And if you know me, you will know I always have new projects in the works.  More on that later..."},
{"title": "And Another Weekly Update", "date": "Wednesday, June 18, 2014", "text": "Week three of working at the WSOP is done and I have about two and a half more weeks to go.  Here's what happened this week:Hubby's cousin gets free comped rooms at the Rio (where the WSOP is being held) and when she found out I was working there, she gave us a room, free, for the past week.  This meant I just had to roll out of bed and go downstairs to work!  Add to that hubby's meal comps at local casinos and we had a basically free week and saved a lot on gas since we didn't have to go back and forth from work to home for four days!I was shocked to receive my monthly royalties payment for my book that I wrote a couple years ago...it was $250!!  It usually averages around $30 to $50 a month so this was a giant jump.  Needless to say, this book is getting updated and republished ASAP.Since I have been working 40 hours a week I have had exactly no time to shop.  What a great way to save money!  All I do is work, eat, relax for a couple of hours, sleep and repeat.I got my first big paycheck from my job and it was just under $1000 for two weeks.  On the one hand, it was a nice chunk of change to add to my bank account, on the other hand, that's a whole lot of work for such a small amount of money.  EeeekkkI found out that while I am an official employee of the casino, there are a lot of discounts I am entitled to (which I will be sure to use before I am no longer an employee in a few weeks).  Discounts include half off at the buffet (which we really like), highly discounted rides on the new Linq, free or discounts rides on the new Rio zipline (need to find out which it is), and discounts in other restaurants and shows at the various casinos in the chain which we also want to take advantage of.  Yippee!My tiny garden is growing slowly but surely.  There has been a bit more chard and the tomatoes are finally turning red (see photo above).On a serious note, my sister texted me a few days ago and said...and I quote...\"our brother is in the hospital and might not make it.\"  So after a some furious texts back and forth, I found out he had a ruptured spleen and was in surgery, and, well, this type of serious injury coupled with a rapid detox from alcohol doesn't bode well for the patient.  Fortunately he pulled through and sounded OK when I talked to him.  Unfortunately our family isn't very close--between my siblings and other assorted family members, they have enough drama for a complete season of Jerry Springer so I basically choose to keep my distance from all of them aside from a once a year get together which pleases my elderly aunts.  Fortunately, I am still kept in the loop...via texts.  Unfortunately, after some pondering of this situation, it dawned on me that #1...me and my siblings are growing older with the assorted problems that come with aging, and #2...collectively my siblings and their adult children couldn't put together $500 in a crisis.  Which made me realize that if one of them were to pass away, which hopeful won't be for a very long time, this expense would probably fall on me.  Note to self, add more to my emergency fund.  Oddly enough, while I plan for literally everything, planning for this expense, never even crossed my mind until now.  Another eeekkkk.So that was my week.  Onward!"},
{"title": "Week 2 Update", "date": "Thursday, June 12, 2014", "text": "Well I managed to survive week two of my temporary job...here's a quick update:Work was fine.  It did, however, reaffirm my notion that I am simply not wired to work a five-day-a-week, 9-5 job.  I know many people would love this kind of job but I need my freedom.  It makes no sense to have to wait until a certain time to \"clock in\" and start working when there is work to be done (ditto the idea of standing around doing nothing when there is no work to do).  I absolutely love having more flexible jobs that allow me to work when I want and how I want but I appreciate the opportunity to work a short six-week session and put some extra money in my pocket.Last week I was reading Carla's blog and saw this article.  It immediately reminded me of a shooting that happened in Tacoma a couple of years before we left the Seattle area.  And then, a couple of days ago, the unimaginable happened AGAIN right here in Las Vegas when two police officers were killed in an ambush shooting.  I seriously don't know what is wrong with people these days.  It makes me want to go be a hermit somewhere and not have to deal with people at all since you never know when someone is going to go crazy and start shooting for no reason whatsoever.  Ugh.The garden isn't going so well.  I did get one serving of chard and a couple of tomatoes are turning red but for all of the work and the lack of results I might have to agree with hubby that it is better to just buy our produce at the 99 cent store.  Or maybe it is just gardening in the 100+ degree desert that makes this harder than I thought it would be.Hubby went to the Goodwill outlet again without me.  His take was 50 pounds of stuff for around $35.  Fortunately we can ship most of the things he got (sheets, towels, clothes, cookware, etc) to his son in the Philippines.  Otherwise we would need to have a garage sale as our garage is filling up with stuff and more stuff.On a happier Las Vegas note, this guy's Las Vegas video has gone viral, our Miss Nevada won the recent Miss USA title, and Cirque du Soleil is 30.And from the \"two steps forward, one step back\" file: we took the van in for it's usual oil change and were happy to see that there was a sale for $11.95 (yeah).  Then we found out that the water pump was leaking so that was a big expense that needed to be taken care of ASAP (boo).  We got a great deal on the water pump and labor because hubby is a friend of the shop's owner (yeah).  Then we were told that the serpentine belt needed to be replaced too which is common is Vegas where rubber anything has an extremely short shelf life in the baking Las Vegas sun (boo).  Then we got the final bill and it was only $200 which is about half of the usual cost mostly, I am guessing, because hubby often brings the guys at the shop lunch (they are mostly Filipino) if he happens to be cooking on the days he drives by the area where the shop is located. Yeah.Finally, here's a few links you might like:Feeding the Family During the Great DepressionHow This Man Plans to Be Mortgage Free By 31Travel Documents You Need to Get in Order"},
{"title": "I Survived My First Week of Work!", "date": "Friday, June 6, 2014", "text": "Well, I survived my first week of work but it was pretty exhausting.  I'm not sure if it was so tiring because I wasn't used to standing on my feet eight hours a day or if it was more mentally exhausting due to all of the counting money in/counting money out non stop for eight hours a day thing.  Overall, it was a fun week with lots of nice people and the days went by super fast because there were so many customers to take care of there was no time to be bored and watch the clock tick by.  And a few more things:I don't know where these young guys get backpacks full of money.  Like literally tens of thousands of dollars in cash that they carry around in their old backpacks that they use to pay for the poker games and events.  Asking for $10,000 doesn't even make them bat an eye!I took a counterfeit $100 a couple of days ago :(  I took one last year that was such a bad fake a blind person would have recognized it but this fake was pretty good.  I hope this doesn't come out of my bonus!I talked to a couple of poker dealers who live on the road and just go from WSOP tournament to WSOP tournament dealing poker.  They live in RVs or in hotels and seem to enjoy the travel and the game of poker (and the money--they can earn over $10,000 a month doing this!).I don't have time for much else.  I come home exhausted and go to sleep super early so there isn't much time for anything--blogging, laundry, housework.  I was very happy to spend my first day off just cleaning the house and doing laundry!The freebies associated with this job are great!  A free buffet we can eat at any time--breakfast, lunch and dinner, even a midnight snack as it is 24 hours.  A free, paid, one hour lunch break.  A free shirt for one of the major poker events that we get to keep.  All the free beverages we want.  Nice!One girl won $871,000 in one of the poker tournaments then just went over and sat down in another poker tournament like it was no big deal (I looked her up online and she has won over $10 million dollars playing poker).  If I won that much money I would be doing the happy dance...for like a week!Well, back to the grind.  Sorry I am not commenting on everyone's blogs this past week but I do read them while I am eating breakfast and getting ready for my day."},
{"title": "End of May Update", "date": "Thursday, May 29, 2014", "text": "This blog may be kind of quiet for a while while I work for the next month but here is a quick catch up:I worked opening day of the WSOP and even sold the very first ticket to the very first event.  The day went SO WELL, none of the craziness from last year because I knew what I was doing and my money balanced so it didn't take me three hours to check out and the people were all super nice...it was wonderful.Hubby can not go shopping without me.  After hubby dropped me off for my first day of work, he headed over to the Goodwill Outlet.  I jokingly texted him and told him not to buy more than 100 pounds of stuff (you pay by the pound at this store).  Well, when I got home he showed me the 50 pounds of stuff he bought (!!) claiming that at 50 pounds the price drops from $1 a pound to 69 cents a pound so he technically got a bunch of stuff for free.  Technically our garage is overflowing so he will be packing up all of his \"finds\" (clothing, sheets, blankets, cookware, etc) and shipping it off to his son and family in the Philippines.  He said he was at the outlet for three hours picking stuff out.  Yikes.Our one tree of apricots are all gone.  Between me and the birds there isn't a single apricot left on the tree.I have five tiny green tomatoes so far and I can't wait until they get ripe.  The chard is actually growing now and the green onions are just about ready.I know our low six-month rate on our cable internet is going to expire soon so I called the company and it won't expire until next month.  I call each time the rate is going to expire and grovel for a low rate just to keep our cable bill down.I came across this article and it is so true.  No matter when you plan to retire, one of the best ways to prepare is to not buy so much stuff...and save your money.It's getting hot in Vegas.  It was 105 a couple of days ago but I think I have finally acclimated to the heat because even at 90 I wear a light jacket when I go out!  On the other hand, it is so cold where I work that I wear two layers just to keep warm so, at least for the month of June, I barely notice it is summer here.We will have a house full of friends and family starting in a couple of weeks (some are coming for the WSOP, others for vacation).  Another nice thing about working is that I don't have the time/opportunity to spend money.  When I am not working, we try to stay home a couple of days a week just to save money because when we leave the house, it is a pretty good bet that we will spend money on something (Goodwill, eating out, food shopping, etc).  By spending all day at work, I am too tied to shop after work so it saves money (as long as I can keep hubby out of the Goodwill).Finally, I walked 42 miles during the month of May which means I need to walk another 701 miles to reach my goal of walking 1000 miles this year (and us being in Las Vegas means it will be too hot to walk all summer so I will need to cram all of these miles in between September and December!)."},
{"title": "Raving About the Goodwill Outlet", "date": "Thursday, May 22, 2014", "text": "Once a week on Wednesdays, we go to our nearest Goodwill store.  Wednesdays are senior day so everything is half off which allows us to buy some really great stuff at really super prices.  Since we missed our regular trip to the Goodwill yesterday, we decided to go to the Goodwill Outlet today where everything is sold in big heaps by the pound.The outlet has to be seen to be believed.  The place is packed with people (mostly resellers by the look of them and judging by the quantity of stuff they are buying) and every time a new bin is brought out, the stuff starts flying (imagine Walmart the day after Thanksgiving) as people sort through it.  It took over an hour of searching through the bins (note to self, bring gloves next time!) but we were able to leave with a whole bunch of stuff for a little under $15.  Here's some of the stuff we got which averaged about 50 cents a piece......a Jones New York sweater...some Hollister shorts for hubby...a cute LeSportsac bag...a Nike Climalite tank top...a steamer for our wok...an Axcess top for me...and yarn (I want to teach myself to knit)If you have a Goodwill Outlet near you, you really should check it out.  It may seem a bit intimidating and a bit icky (the stuff isn't cleaned up and neatly displayed like in the regular Goodwill stores) but the super cheap prices make it worth the effort to sort through the icky stuff to find the gems!"},

{"title": "A Bunch of Random Things...", "date": "Monday, May 19, 2014", "text": "I haven't been keeping up with my blogging very well (and probably won't be over the next month unless I have lots to talk about due to working which may happen...) but here is a quick catch up...I tried to restyle this blog a bit (sadly, I have no artistic talent whatsoever...).I completed three days of training for the WSOP and have one more day before I actually start working.  Compared to last year they are doing a whole lot more hands-on training which is a really good thing for the new people.  Unfortunately, my 20 hours of scheduled training turned out to be like 10 hours of training because if we knew what we were doing we were told we could go home early.  I actually remember everything, even the computer codes, so I am looking forward to a much less stressful first few weeks (if you remember last year I was ready to quit on day three I was so stressed and overwhelmed) but I would have liked the pay for those extra 10 hours!I am getting lots more hours this month from my client but I know June, in fact all of summer, is a quiet time in her office so it is good that I will have some extra income from working the WSOP.I am eating fresh apricots each morning for breakfast.  I just walk outside and pick them off the tree (the ones the birds dodn't get) and they are so yummy!We watch a lot of TV in the evening.  Many of the shows from this season are wrapping up this week.  I was really happy the dad and son won the Amazing Race, my guess is that Caleb will win American Idol, and my other guess is that Meryl and Maks will win Dancing With the Stars.  And while it seems like all I do is watch TV, I actually read each evening while watching TV so I feel somewhat more productive because of that. I have been really good about not spending money recently even though it has been so tempting.  I haven't bought anything from REI's big sale which is going on now, I was thisclose to buying a new suitcase today but decided to wait until the fall when I will really need it (the wheel broke on my old suitcase during out last trip), and the plan today was to get a new TV for one of the guest rooms (the one that was there was moved to the garage so we can watch it while on the treadmill) but hubby said he would be happy to move the TV back up to the room if needed which was both logical and money saving.I haven't walked in over a week.  Partly because I'm lazy and partly because it is so hot outside now.  Walking will resume in the fall.And finally, I am SO HAPPY today for my friend.  He has been in a legal battle for more than 15 years (and acting as his own attorney or he would have been bankrupted long ago).  First the prosecutor appealed and appealed and appealed in criminal court for more than 12 years until the case was finally and unequivocally tossed out then the prosecutor turned around and tried to sue him civilly for the past three years and that case was finally and completely tossed out today (the story didn't make the paper yet).  Yippee!!!!!!And finally, finally, I have been really lax on commenting on everyone's blogs but I do read them each morning when I eat breakfast.  I will try to catch up on commenting soon!"},

Other than that, not a lot has been happening around here.  Today should be the first (of many) 100 degree days in Las Vegas, the apricots on our tree are nearly ripe (in May no less!), and the tomato plant still looks promising.I hope you have a wonderful weekend!"},

{"title": "Today Was a Good People Day", "date": "Tuesday, April 29, 2014", "text": "Some days I have bad people days--the guy in traffic who cuts me off, the cranky person on the phone giving me the run around, etc.  Today, however, was a good people day.I called the VA hospital where hubby has to get his new hearing aids and the guy I talked to was really helpful.  When we first changed our enrollment from Seattle to Vegas the guy who did his enrollment said hubby would have to pay co pays and fees and a bunch of stuff we never had to pay before.  So I called the billing department today and the guy I talked to was super helpful and patient, explaining all of the intricacies of VA billing, and ended up saying that hubby can get any and all care at our local VA clinic instead of going to the military hospital, and everything would be free--no co pays, no specialist fees, etc.  Yippee!Then I called my friend who I am doing a bunch of work for and not only did she give me a bunch  more work (another yippee) but we just had a long, wonderful chat on the phone.Next I checked my bank account and found that this month's paycheck came in a few days early so I ran (actually walked) to the bank and paid off the visa I used to pay for our vacation.  The girl at the bank was super nice as well!My next stop was the grocery store by our house.  This is one of the few chain grocery stores that cuts their own meat while you watch.  We have often picked up super cheap pork trimmings (fat, bones, a bit of meat but mostly fat) for 99 cents a pound.  While most people wouldn't eat this, adding the fat to Filipino dishes makes the food even better than using the usual lean meat found in grocery stores.  I told the butcher what I was looking for and he put aside about five pounds for me which we picked up later in the afternoon.Finally we went to the Rio buffet (birthday gift from the SIL) and while the price is usually 50% off for locals, the cashier told us that beginning last January the discount is only 25%.  I showed the manager the discount that is shows for locals on their website which was really non-specific--it said up to 50% without an explanation that it was for high dollar comp players--and he said this time he would give us the 50% off this time.  Yeah!  Non people related--I was able to jump through all of the hoops to get a super cheap version of MS Office Pro downloaded to my computer and it actually works (since I am doing so much work for a non-profit they paid for a copy of this otherwise super expensive software through TechSoup).  The hard part is getting everything registered and signed up and visiting a half dozen websites, etc.  Eventually I figured it out.  Yippee!"},
{"title": "A Quick Update on My Annual Goals", "date": "Monday, April 28, 2014", "text": "I posted my goals for 2014 over on the sidebar at the beginning of the year.  I figured I would take a look at them and see if I am on track or not with them (note the red goals have been completed):Go to Europe (I'm hoping we will do this in the fall but no solid plans yet)Work WSOP (I'm all signed up and ready to work in about a month!)Walk a marathon (I am tentatively planning to do this in Washington DC in October)Do Centurion Challenge (this challenge is to walk 100 volksmarches; I just counted and have only done 10.  Not sure if I will complete this or not)Go to San Francisco 4/15 (we did this as a side trip on our way to Seattle and although we only spent five hours in San Francisco, we had a great time)Go to New Orleans (no solid plans for this but I hope to squeeze it in sometime)Get new washer and dryer (we bought a new washer and dryer then promptly returned them after reading so many bad reviews; hopefully we will find a set we like by the end of the year)Get new refrigerator 1/28 (I just happened to be shopping and came across a nice, new, cheap side by side and we love it)Hike Grand Canyon (there is no solid plan for this but physically I would have no problem doing it, however hubby wants me to go with someone and not do this 25 mile hike alone in one day...any takers?)Visit Hubby's family (again, no solid plan but we can catch up with them when we go to the East Coast in the fall)Visit my family 4/19 (I organize an annual family reunion lunch for my family and got to catch up with everyone a couple of weeks ago)Go to Asia (again no solid plans but hopefully we will get there in the fall)Walk 1000 miles (I'm making good progress on this goal but probably won't walk much in the super hot summer here so will have to pile on the miles after August)"},
{"title": "10 Things: A Weekend Update", "date": "Saturday, April 26, 2014", "text": "Here's what's happening this weekend...I so don't have a green thumb.  Above are photos of my \"garden\".  The green onions are growing but crowded, the chard was eaten down to the stalks by something, and the tomatoes are going along (but hubby said why not just spend $1 at the $1 store for a dozen tomatoes--it's faster and less work).  He has a point.I was supposed to do a volksmarch today but it was really windy and walking in blowing dust is just miserable.  I counted it up and so far I have only done 10 volksmarches this year but my goal is to walk 100 of them so I better get busy!I'm still making about $30 a month in royalties from my book.  I NEED to get this book updated plus I have about nine others on the drawing board.  If I get all of these written and published it could fund our travel dreams!Speaking of travel, I was penciling out our fall vacation plans.  I would love to fly from Las Vegas to Japan to Manila, stay in the Philippines for a couple of weeks, then fly from Manila to London and spend a week or two in the UK with a side trip to Paris; fly from London to New York and visit family/get some dental work done; head from New York to Washington DC where I would do the Freedom Walk Festival then hop down to Miami and catch a Panama Canal cruise to LA where we would then take the Megabus back to Las Vegas.  Now to win the lottery...Hubby had me hem a couple of pairs of pants for him yesterday.  Usually he just uses hemming tape but it didn't seem to hold so I threaded a needle and got busy and they look pretty well done if I do say so myself.  And I've found that I enjoy hand sewing.  I think I will hand sew some little project like one of the tutorials over at Carla's blog.The cousins called and asked if we want to go to a show with them this evening and of course we said yes.  They have subscriptions to House Seats and go to shows nearly every other day.  While I thought this would be a two hour Vegas-type stage show it is actually an all evening disco dance party.  Now to dust off my old disco clothing (and stuff myself into them...eekkkk). I mailed a small gift to a friend in Japan yesterday and the mailing price was astronomical!  I deliberately pick light-weight things (this was a scarf) and the cost was still $9!  I went home and looked up the price online at USPS and it looks like it should have only been $5.  Next time I will look up the price and print it off before I go to the post office so I will be able to argue the cost they try to charge me.I keep stumbling across articles about class action rebates and while I have never applied for one, I recently saw a rebate for DRAM products which I am sure we had bought in the past (average rebate is $100!).  I am definitely going to take the time tomorrow to apply for this and other rebates we qualify for!Hubby's sister told us to go out to dinner on her for my birthday.  While I usually choose to go to Fogo de Chau for these special, expensive meals that are gifted to us, I was disappointed that the lunch price went from $25 to $32.  So I hopped online to look for other options and came across this great list of locals discounts and we decided we would print out the coupon and hit up the Planet Hollywood buffet (yum crab!) for my birthday dinner.Finally, it is raining this afternoon.  I love the rain in Las Vegas (just not all the time like it rains in Seattle).Have a wonderful weekend!"},
{"title": "And I Thought the Goodwill Was Cheap", "date": "Thursday, April 24, 2014", "text": "We are Goodwill converts.  Ten years ago if you would have told me I would even enter the door of the Goodwill I would have said \"ick\" and \"no way\".  But after seeing how much money we can save shopping at this thrift store and how cool the items are (name brands and high dollar items if you were to buy the things at the mall), we rarely shop anywhere else these days.So imagine our surprise when we found out that our city now has a Goodwill clearance center.  We went to check it out today and found that this is an even better (read cheaper) way to shop for some items.  The place is a huge warehouse filled with bins of stuff.  The items aren't neatly arranged and cleaned up.  In fact it looks like a backhoe picked up stuff by the cart-full and dropped them into the dozen or so bins that filled the store.  So we jumped into the fray and came away with the following: 2 long sleeve Gap shirts, 1 pair Billabong swim trunks, one waist pack for walking (that I couldn't find anywhere...this one is exactly what I was looking for!), one padded envelope, one pair of sweatpants for lounging around the house, and a very cool curtain that matches our living room decor perfectly.  All of this for a grand total of $3.60!  They sell stuff by the pound and apparently we bought three pounds of stuff.We will definitely add this to our shopping rounds each week (and also get there early as the people we saw at the store today looked like professional resalers (they had gloves on to search through the bins, raced from bin to bin quickly identifying stuff they wanted, and were buying huge carts of stuff for pennies on the dollar).If you have a Goodwill clearance center in your area, it is definitely worth the trip to check it out!"},
{"title": "Celebrating My Birthday", "date": "Tuesday, April 22, 2014", "text": "My birthday was a few days ago and I just got done celebrating  it with free stuff!  A couple of years ago when we first moved here and we had very little money, I was looking for ways to celebrate our birthdays on the cheap.  I went online and found a website similar to this one and promptly signed up for a bunch of birthday freebies at local restaurants.A week or so ago my email box was flooded with coupons for free stuff!  While there were a few we couldn't use (like Dennys where you get a free meal only on your birthday and we were traveling at the time with nary a Dennys in sight) or didn't want to use (buy one get one free deals are kind of meh), we did end up sharing the following free (yummy) items from some great restaurants:...a pizza from Grimaldies...a scoop of ice cream from Baskin Robbins...a milkshake from Del Taco...and a breakfast from IHopWhat a wonderful way to celebrate a birthday!"},
{"title": "Vacation Wrap-Up (Part 3 of 3)", "date": "Monday, April 21, 2014", "text": "And here's a final wrap up of our vacation...mostly random musings...This vacation allowed me to knock two more goals off of my annual goal list--visiting San Francisco and visiting my family.We each took a small suitcase and a small backpack with us (both were easily carried onto the plane so we didn't have to pay to check baggage) and we still had a bunch of clothes that we didn't wear!Airport USOs are awesome!  This is such a great service for military members.  Free everything: coffee, food, info, bag check, shower facilities sometimes, wi fi, computers to use, bunk rooms sometimes, etc.  And the volunteer staff are wonderful as well.I will definitely want to go back and see more of San Francisco.  I am a bit disappointed that the BART system doesn't have a day pass like many city transit systems.  You have to pay per trip which can really rack up the charges!Going back to visit our home town was kind of bittersweet.  We were happy to see friends we hadn't seen in ages, less happy that as everyone is getting older (most of our friends are in their 60s and 70s) they are also getting sicker and dying (one friend has stage 4 lung cancer, one has stage 4 colon cancer, another friend will soon go on permanent dialysis, and when I asked another person we ran into at the buffet how his wife was he said she died unexpectedly a couple of months ago...all of this happened in ONE DAY!  At this point I pretty much didn't want to hear from anyone else unless they were young and healthy.  Sad).After a week of grey, rainy Washington weather I was SO HAPPY to get back to the hot, sunny weather of Las Vegas.  Should I become wealthy, however, I think it would be nice to have a summer home in Washington and live there only for June, July, and August when the weather is much more pleasant.Due to all of the wet weather, the myriad shades of green and profusion of flowers everywhere are a bright spot (pun intended) in an often dismal place.My friend's \"adopted\" two year old grandson (no relation but she makes a better grandma than most) cracked me up.  I asked him what the dog says (he barks), I asked him what a pig says (he oinked), then I asked him what the cat says and he scrunched up his face and hissed.  Seems the cat has learned to stay out of his way since he learned how to walk.I can literally tolerate my family about once a year, for a day at most (fortunately my friend understands this so we stay with her when we are in town).  I have no idea how my classy grandmother and well educated, hard working great aunts and uncles ended up with a family legacy that is more a mix of Teen Mom/Honey Boo Boo/Duck Dynasty (minus the money) than anything else.  I didn't realize how enmeshed we were in our small town until every single place we went (buffet, casino, mall, restaurants) people came up to ask how we've been.  I miss that sense of community here in Las Vegas.Now that our vacation is done, I am NOT SPENDING ANY MONEY until fall.  I want to work, work, work all summer and save up a lot of money for a really great vacation in the fall (hopefully a trip to the East Coast, a volksmarch festival, a cruise, and a trip to the UK followed by a trip to Asia)."},
{"title": "Some Vacation Pix (Part 2 of 3)", "date": "Sunday, April 20, 2014", "text": "Here's some pictures from our recent vacation to San Francisco and Washington State.  I'll post more pix over at my other blog as well.San Francisco was wonderful!  The weather was perfect and so was the clam chowder!There seemed to be a lot of churches in San Francisco...And cable cars too...Seattle was grey and rainy as usual...But it makes for some beautiful flowers...This is my $3.00 backpack from the Goodwill (from now I am checking out Goodwills in every city we visit!)...And a picture of my sister's fat cat...If you ever go to Kingston, Washington at the ferry entrance, you must try their crepes...And the Seattle train station which dates to 1910 is absolutely gorgeous...We had a wonderful trip last week!  We flew from Las Vegas to San Francisco, spent the day in San Francisco then flew to Seattle, took a ferry to the Kitsap Peninsula, visited there for a couple of days, came back to Seattle, took the train to Portland where we stayed for a couple of days, then flew home to Las Vegas.The finances (costs for both of us):Flight from Las Vegas to San Francisco $184.00Flight from San Francisco to Seattle $140.00Train from Seattle to Portland $61.05Flight from Portland to Las Vegas $230.00We spent the day in San Francisco and it was wonderful!  We dropped our bags at the USO (its like a very fancy lounge at the airport for military and retired military members) and got a bunch of tourist info from the guy at the desk there.  We hopped on the BART train for the trip into downtown San Francisco, got off in Chinatown, then walked down to Fisherman's Wharf.  At Fisherman's Wharf we had to try some clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl (yummy) which is kind of a San Francisco classic, then we took a cable car back up to Chinatown.  We ate lunch in Chinatown (both yummy and cheap), then took the BART train back to the airport.  We hung out a bit at the USO before our flight left and chatted with the volunteer staff there who were great!  Total spent in San Francisco: $79.10 (for BART train, cable car ride, and food)Next we were off to Seattle where we took the lite rail from the airport to the ferry then took the ferry to the Kitsap Peninsula where we stayed with hubby's cousin who had just visited us in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  Total spent on transportation: $14.50The next day we hit some of our favorite places including the most amazing crepe place ($17.67), hubby played poker with some of his old poker buddies while I met up with a friend for lunch ($21.11), we stopped by the $1 Store to buy treats for my friend's kids ($7.75), meandered by the Goodwill where I found a brand new Sherpani backpack for $3.03, and then met up with a bunch of friends for a wonderful buffet at the Suquamish Casino ($5 for tip, they paid for dinner).Thursday we were off again!  I picked up a hot chocolate at my favorite coffee place for $3.35 then paid $4 for the city bus to get to the ferry.  The ferry was free on the return trip to Seattle, and we had a great lunch at one of our favorite Chinese places (Harbor City dim sum...as usual it was a half hour wait just to get in the door) for $29.58.  I picked up a bottle of water for $1.95 then we hopped on the Amtrak to head south.On Friday I spent the day working at my friend's office then we were invited to dinner with my sisters (which, surprise, I got to pay for...$120.00!).Saturday was our final day of vacation.  We went to a buffet ($27.11) for our big family reunion where I saw family members I hadn't seen for 30+ years!  We also gave $20 to a niece to pay for her dinner, then picked up candy at the $1 Store ($2.00) before we caught our plane back to Las Vegas.What saved us a lot of money was staying with friends and relatives in each place plus they gave us cars to use while we were there so no hotel costs and no rental car costs saved us a lot of money.  We spent a crazy amount of money on restaurants which was fine because we pretty much expected this as mostly what we do when we vacation is eat out.  We also got a couple of nice discounts because I asked for hubby's senior discount on things like the train and ferry.Total spent on our trip: $971.20In order to keep this post less than 500 inches long, I will post pictures of our trip in the next blog post..."},
{"title": "I Need to Stop Shopping!", "date": "Tuesday, April 8, 2014", "text": "We are getting ready for our trip and I have been doing way too much shopping!  Among our purchases:Hubby pulled out his (very old) netbook that he uses for traveling and it was SO SLOW that I decided he needed a new travel computer.  A tablet would be kind of hard for him to manage because he plays a lot of poker online so he ended up with a small ChromeBook which he loves (and was very cheap at under $200).  The Chrome Book was SO SIMPLE that he loves it.  He doesn't really do anything on computers besides watch Netflix and play poker so a computer with only a couple of buttons to click on works great for him.I did get a $500+ refund when I returned the new computer I bought hubby last week.  I thought a big 17\" laptop would be great for him as he tends to watch Netflix and play poker at the same time so more screen space seemed like it would be a good idea.  However,the computer came with Windows 8 which he absolutely hated and told me to return it.  So now he will just keep his 15\" laptop until a better operating system comes out.I got (yet another) new tablet.  I had a 7\" tablet a few months ago but since it was just barely bigger than my cell phone it wasn't all that useful so I sold it on Craigslist (at a $30 loss from what I originally purchased it for).  But for traveling I decided I would rather carry a tablet that my 14\" laptop.  So I did a ton of research (as usual) and found that while a nice Galaxy Tab Pro 12\" or a Surface Pro would be wonderful, it would also be very expensive (at $600+).  So for $279 I got a 10\" Asus Memo tablet which had many hundreds of very positive reviews.  I need to buy a blue tooth keyboard and mouse for it (via Amazon which is much cheaper than in stores) and I will be all set for traveling with a very lightweight but still very functional computer/tablet.I need some black shoes for my WSOP work.  Last year I spent about $10 on a cheap pair from Payless which actually worked fine (they were comfortable but since they were plastic-ish tennis shoes the smelled pretty badly after eight hours of work).  So now I am looking at getting some more expensive New Balance shoes (like this) made specifically for walking which I will be able to use both for work and for my distance walking.  *Speaking of which I have walked six miles a day for the past four days and hope to keep it up until we go on vacation*Bottom line: after our trip I am definitely going on a spending fast until about July.  The month of May should be pretty quiet around here and I figure that while I am working during the month of June I will be too busy to go shopping.  I need to start saving money instead of spending it!"},

{"title": "What A Week...An Update", "date": "Thursday, April 3, 2014", "text": "Seems like all I have been doing on this blog lately is posting quick updates a couple times a week but it has been hectic around here so, here is yet again another update...My little garden is growing!  See photo above ^We thought we would take a nice day trip to Laughlin.  Driving ourselves would cost around $50 in gas since it is 200 miles round trip so I found this tour place online and booked our trip.  We figured that for $32 for both of us, offset by the $20 meal voucher it would be a nice, cheap day trip.  Then after I booked the trip I read these reviews and was a bit disheartened.  We then got ourselves up early and took ourselves to the appointed place to meet the bus and...no one showed up.  I called when the bus was a half hour late and the lady said they had cancelled the trip.  Of course they didn't contact me and tell me this.  I told her I wanted my money back and now I am waiting....and waiting.  Oddly enough, the next day I found another website that offers the same tour through the same company for $5 per person and includes meal vouchers as well.  I'm deciding now if, once my money is refunded, we try this same company but at a much better price.  I am doing A LOT of work for my friend this month which makes me very happy.  I also can't wait until WSOP starts.  I am eager to make MONEY!Hubby's cousin called today in a panic because her hot water tank died.  There was water everywhere (not a good thing when she is in a second floor condo) so we helped her clean up then took her to the home store to get a new hot water tank and found someone to hook it up for her.  We then ran home, checked out some \"how to get the sediment out of your hot water tank and extend its life\" videos on YouTube and drained the sediment out of our hot water tank in hopes of extending its life and not having a hot water tank crisis like she did.  eeekkkkYesterday at the Goodwill (half off senior day of course) hubby found a great deal on a Magic Sing.  It's a requirement in Filipino families that you have a high tech karaoke system so we, of course have one (and spent over $500 for it some years ago!).  The karaoke system he found was priced at $25 so we grabbed it (obviously no one there knew what it was or the price would have been much higher).  We brought it home, tested it, found that it works great, and then packed it up to send to his son who lives in the Philippines (they will be overjoyed at receiving such a nice system). Our Washington trip has been set.  We (more like I) decided that hubby is going with me AND I will be able to knock off two on my annual goals (see sidebar) along the way.  We will fly from Vegas to San Francisco, spend the day there, then fly to Seattle where we will stay for a few days (and hopefully get to the San Juan Islands this time).  We will then take the train or bus to Portland and attend my family reunion before heading back to Vegas.  Then I promised hubby no more trips until the fall when we go to Asia or Europe (hopefully both depending on how much I make this summer).Here's some great links to check out: here, here, and here.Since I have been doing so much work for my friend, she is going to get me a complete MS Office Pro suite of software (I am using the starter Word and Excel programs that came with my computer which aren't so great) at Tech Soup.  This is a great place to get super low low prices on software if you are with a non profit.  Yippee!I read this post on Barb's blog and know exactly how she is feeling.  My blog too has kind of become more about me me me and less about being a money blog.  It was great to track how our money habits have changed for the better over the years but these days our money habits are so ingrained that I often don't feel like I have much more to write about.I walked only 39 miles in March which leaves me to walk 824 more miles this year to reach my goal."},
{"title": "My 10 Favorite (Free) Apps", "date": "Saturday, March 29, 2014", "text": "I love Android products (cell phones, tablets, etc) and I especially love that I can find so many free apps in the Google Play store for them.  Here's my ten favorite apps that I tend to use all the time:Runtastic.  I just started using the free version of this app and so far it works really well.  It is a pedometer that tracks my steps when I am walking every morning and so far it seems pretty accurate (but I can't figure out how it works--I don't even have my cell's GPS on and I didn't have to calibrate it but somehow it knows...)Kingsoft Office.  This office suite works seamlessly with Microsoft Office so if I want to create a document on the go I can simply create it on my cell in Kingsoft then email it to myself and open it in MS Office.Scanner Radio.  If I am bored I would rather listen to 911 calls than music.  Weird huh?  This is an interesting app that lets you listen in on police and fire dispatch channels all around the country.Bravo Poker.  This is the best poker app out there.  Even though I don't play, I use this app to let hubby know where the best games are at (quite helpful since we live in Las Vegas and there are dozens and dozens of poker rooms here).Reddit is Fun.  I love reddit and even though I'm on that site way too much as it is, I like having it at my fingertips on my cell.TV Guide.  I use this app all the time.  We are usually home in the evenings and almost always have the TV on in the background.  This is a quick way to see what's on TV--even faster than looking it up online.Kindle.  While I like watching TV in the evenings, I love reading anytime.  I can download as many free ebooks from my local library as I want and they all wait right here on my cell on this Kindle app for me to read them.Skype.  Since my cell's pre-paid plan only comes with 100 talk minutes a month, I use Skype on my cell phone all the time.  With Skype's $2.95 unlimited calling plan, I can call in to multi-hour meetings without worrying about using up my calling minutes.  The clarity of the calls is also amazing!Banking apps.  We have more than a half dozen bank accounts spread over three banks, two of which are out of state so the apps for our banks are really useful.  Just snap a picture of a check and it is instantly deposited!A Swype-like keyboard app.  Swype comes pre-installed on my cell but it is a paid app for those who don't have it.  I really can't live without it as it makes messaging and emailing and basically doing any sort of typing at all on my cell bearable.  A similar keyboard app which is free and very popular is SwiftKey.What are your favorite free/cheap apps?"},

For a bright, shining moment I was kind of offered a job which borders on six figures.  I still do some government contracting work for a client I used to do work for back when I lived in Washington.  Turns out an in-house job came available and I had four people send me the job description and tell me to apply because it is the same work I am doing now and have been doing for years.  I called the lady who was hiring for the job (turns out we used to work together some years ago) and asked if I would be able to do the job remotely then fly in for meetings every month or so but she said they really need a person nearby since there are meetings to go to every week.  Bummer.  But there is no way we are moving back to that kind of weather.I saw this recipe for biscuits and am going to give it a try.  One of my favorite things in Georgia was homemade southern biscuits.  Yummy!I came across this website and there are a few items that I would actually qualify for so I will fill the forms out for these items as soon as I get a spare moment.I also heard that as you get older your brain stops functioning so well and a way to keep your brain sharp is to \"train\" it.  Which you can do here.  I need to give this a try!Still no word on the travel front.  I haven't bought tickets yet but I better get moving.  I may end up just going for the day and leaving hubby at home.It was half off day at the Goodwill today so we bought a bunch of clothes and things to send to the Philippines (we send boxes of clothes, food, and household goods to hubby's son and his family in the Philippines every couple of months).  Both the shopping at the Goodwill and the saving 50% part because hubby is a senior saves us A LOT of money.One of my clients called and asked if I could do a quick needs survey for all of her agencies.  I quickly said yes then set about figuring out how to do it.  I found a free survey site called Survey Monkey which seems to work really well (now I'm just waiting for the results to see the final product).It is SO windy today I couldn't even walk today.  I have been walking four miles a day for the past week to make up for all of the days I missed walking when we had guests but when the wind is blowing so much dust around it is difficult to even breathe outside.I just realized we haven't been to Walmart (or most any other store for that matter) in ages.  Basically all of our shopping needs can be met at the Dollar Tree, 99 Cent store, and our local grocery store.  Everything is blooming (even my allergies but I digress...).  We have a bunch of apricots on our apricot tree, the chard is looking good, the green onions are getting taller and even the tomatoes are making a bit of headway after I replanted them to bigger containers."},
{"title": "Money Money Money", "date": "Saturday, March 22, 2014", "text": "First, some good money things:I was looking at my credit card account (the one I got that I used to buy the appliances with a while back) and saw that there was $135 waiting for me in the rewards section.  Seems this was a cash rewards kind of credit card (which I didn't really know much about or expect) and that was my cash reward for all of the purchases I made on it!  Yippee.  Instead of cashing it out, I will charge the tickets for our Seattle trip then put this extra, unexpected money towards paying it off.  I'm beginning to think that maybe I should use this credit card for all of our monthly spending then pay it off at the end of each month while racking up cash rewards.  The only problem is that I seem to spend more money when I use the card instead of cash so there is that.One of hubby's bowling friends heard that I knew something about computers so he asked if I could set up his printer and router which I did last week.  He offered to pay me at the time and I said no, I just like to help people out and not to worry about it.  After bowling yesterday he and his wife insisted that we go to lunch with them...at a seafood place...where each entree was $30+.  They didn't have to do that but it was a nice lunch and since we never spend that much on a meal (and the days of my expense account lunches are long over) it was a nice surprise.  I finished up processing for my WSOP job and since I worked last year they were very nice about offering me whatever work I wanted.  I got to choose my shift (days), whether I wanted full or part time (full), where I wanted to work (a super busy, low dollar cash cage instead of the slower cage where you are counting out $10,000 per transaction...and doing all of the paperwork associated with such a large transaction) and they even asked me what days I wanted off or if I wanted any special days off like 4th of July (I told them every day was pretty much the same when you are retired so they could work me every single day if they wanted to).  tldr; I want to rack up the cash for our fall trip to Europe and this seems like the best way to do it!Some great links (about money of course):How to build a 400 square foot solar cabin for $2000 (I would LOVE to do this!)How a 21 day financial fast saved me tons (always a great way to save money)Google search for flights (I use this more than Travelocity now...it's great!)How to retire early with 13 kids (love articles like this!)And some other stuff:I am looking at crossing off two more of my annual goals--meet up with my family and go to San Francisco--in April.  It is just HOW to do this the cheapest way possible that is the issue.  (Hubby is the other issue, he says he is on vacation everyday so why go anywhere...ugh).  So I have looked at every possible trip configuration--from Megabus to Amtrak to flying to driving--and still haven't decided.  Driving is the cheapest way to go but neither of us wants to sit that long.  Megabus to LA then to San Francisco then flying to Seattle and taking the Amtrak to Portland is another option.  Just flying is the more expensive option because we would have to fly to San Francisco then to Portland then to Seattle then back home and would need a rental car in Portland.  Then we would need hotels at each place plus meals out plus dragging hubby about with me then dealing with my dysfunctional family on top of that...and I can see why hubby would rather just stay home.  Buy I have a couple of elderly aunts that were so thrilled that I set up a family reunion for the first time in 30 years last year that I don't want to disappoint them.  So I will work something out..."},
{"title": "Another Catch Up Post to, Well, Catch Up", "date": "Thursday, March 20, 2014", "text": "Whew!  All of the guests have left so now I can get back to blogging and reading/commenting on your blogs (I generally read through everyone's blogs in the morning while eating breakfast but don't sign in and comment because I don't have time...now onward!).Here's a quick catch up...Those dreams of owning a B & B that I once considered...gone.  It is a lot of work having guests, keeping them fed, making sure they are entertained, doing laundry, and cleaning.  The idea of owning a quaint B & B is nice, reality...not so much.I sold my old smartphone as a way to recoup some of the money I spent on my new phone.  I perused eBay to see what similar phones were selling for then decided to try listing it on Craigslist first because it is way less hassle (no waiting for payment, packaging it, shipping it, hoping it makes it to the buyer, etc.).  I knocked $20 off of the price it was listing for on eBay because I don't have the shipping costs and extra work of auctioning it.  You know you listed an item too cheaply when you get ten calls within ten minutes of posting it.  Ugh.  Live and learn I guess. I am not a Keurig fan.  Everyone who comes to our house is shocked because we don't have a Keurig coffee maker like \"everyone else\".  Which makes me launch into the old \"my coffee maker is better\" speech.  We bought a $10 coffee maker when we moved into our new place and it is wonderful.  It is much cheaper than a Keurig (I can make a whole pot of coffee for less than the price of one K cup), it is less wasteful than a Keurig (each of those K cups is a lot of plastic waste that needs to be disposed of.  With a regular coffee maker the coffee grounds can go into the garden and the thin paper filter goes into the garbage), it is MUCH faster (the speed difference between making a 12 cup pot of coffee and waiting for 12 individual cups of Keurig coffee to be made is no contest at all), and finally my old coffee maker isn't proprietary (you can use any filer and any coffee and it will pump out vast quantities of coffee with no problem, the new Keurigs will be made so that the machine will not accept any other brand of K cups except for Keurig K cups...blah!).  I'll hop off my soapbox now.Finally, we got a great iron at the Goodwill this week for $3.95.  We burn through (no pun intended) irons pretty quickly because we iron every piece of clothing that we wear (I don't like to be wrinkly) which means about every three or four years our iron gives up the ghost, heaves water all over the place, and end up in the garbage.  We used to spend around $70 a pop for a good iron but since we are now buying everything else at the Goodwill, we bought a new (to us) iron yesterday and absolutely love it!  It is very heavy, heats up quickly, has a great steam feature, and best of all it was $3.95!!"},
{"title": "A Quick Catch Up in 5 Points and a Recipe", "date": "Saturday, March 15, 2014", "text": "Point 1.  We have had guests for more than a week and one group is still here (thus the lack of posts recently).Point 2.  I am still loving my new Note 2 so as soon as things calm down around here I will put my old smart phone, tablet, and digital camera up for sale (it replaces all of these with ease).Point 3.  I became totally sold on the Note 2 when I was able to go on our library's website and check out free ebooks then download them to my Kindle app.  Both my old smart phone and my tablet didn't do this very well (I think because the processor in the Note 2 is blazing fast).Point 4.  All of our guests have decided they need to move to Las Vegas ASAP.  My SIL, who is a dentist, even called to see how she would change her licensing so she could practice in Nevada (that group is from Connecticut and none of them wanted to go home to more snow...I don't blame them).  Hopefully we will have lots of friends and family living here within the next year or so!Point 5.  I have been cooking and cleaning like a dervish.  Fortunately hubby cooks most meals (Filipino food) but I have been doing a ton of baking.  Cooking at home--everything from breakfast and dinner to snacks--is an excellent way for our guests to save money on food while they are here.  Every couple of days hubby takes everyone out (like to the Hoover Dam or Red Rock Canyon) so I can do a quick house cleaning and laundry.  This also works out well.And a super simple recipe for Leche Flan. A friend of mine made this flan at our house last year when she was here and it was great.  She cooked it by steaming it on the stove but since the stove was occupied a few days ago, I tried cooking it in the oven (much simpler) and it came out great!First, set up a 13 x 9 baking dish with smaller pans in it for the flan (I use small loaf pans and can fit three, side by side, in the large baking dish).  Add hot water to the big pan so it surrounds the smaller baking pans.  Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.Caramelize 1 cup of white sugar in a heavy bottom sauce pan on the stove.  Be sure to keep stirring the sugar until it melts.  When it gets to be a light caramel color, remove it from the heat and pour into the small loaf pans (it will barely cover the bottom of these pans; if it doesn't cover them all the way, don't worry about it as it will spread out once it gets in the oven).  BE CAREFUL doing this.  This is the scariest part about candy making because if you get any of this melted sugar on you it will cause a SEVERE burn.Let the pans sit for a minute while you mix up the flan.  In a blender, put one can of evaporated milk, one can of sweetened condensed milk, four eggs, and a teaspoon of vanilla.  Blend well.Divide this mixture among the small loaf pans then add a bit more water to the water bath part of the big baking dish.  You don't want it so deep it spills over but you want it to reach up the sides of the smaller pans.  Use a sheet of foil to cover the three pans collectively (not the entire baking dish) then put this in the oven for about an hour and a half or until the tops look a bit dry.Remove the smaller pans from the water bath and let them cool for a few minutes on top of the stove.  Leave the big pan with water in the oven until it cools off then you can dump it.  After about ten minutes, run a knife along the sides of the flan then put a pie plate or other plate with a lip over the small pan and quickly flip the flan out.  You can eat it right away but I think it is better if allowed to set up in the refrigerator for about an hour."},
{"title": "10 Things About My Galaxy Note", "date": "Saturday, March 8, 2014", "text": "After having 24 hours to play with my new phone, I've found out the following things (applicable to many phones I think):Between the time that your new phone was manufactured and the time it lands on your doorstep a lot of time could have passed (like a year or more if you wait until the phone has been out for ages and is now on sale like when I buy them).  Which means it is a good idea to Google and see if your phone has firmware updates available.  I did this and it updated the entire operating system for free.  Yippee!I know very little about apps because I use so few of them so I Googled \"best android apps 2014\" and came up with lots of good apps to check out.  I don't really play video games so I haven't downloaded any of them but I NEED the Kindle app and I also downloaded the Kingsoft office program since it was rated better than the Polaris office program that came on my phone (on the rare occasion that I write a document on my phone, I simply email it to myself and it integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Office on my computer).  Another app that I haven't had time to look at yet but may end up using is AirDroid which allows you to sync between your home computer and cell phone.  Cool!The Note itself isn't as big as I thought it would be.  When I first saw someone using the Note a year ago I thought it was huge but then again, my basic cell phone at the time was tiny.  I do like how big and bright the screen is which makes everything from phone numbers to articles on CNN easier to read.The thing is expensive.  When the Note first came out over a year ago it cost around $700.  When I started watching the price on it a few months ago it was at $520.  When I finally broke down and bought it the price was $460 (plus $10 for the new, necessary SIM card for it and $30 for a month's airtime which works just fine with my pre-paid plan).  Needless to say I really worry about this phone--everything from dropping it to it getting stolen--which is kind of a bummer because it is only a phone and one shouldn't have to stress out over a phone.  But I do.Since the phone is expensive and relatively fragile, I hopped on Amazon and bought a gel case for it.  Amazon seems to have the best prices for cell cases compared to buying them at any brick and mortar store.  For the Note, the case cost $8.95.  For my previous smartphone I bought a similar case on Amazon for it and the cost was around $2.95 which included shipping from Hong Kong.  The note has a stylus that comes latching inside the body of the phone.  It even has an alarm to alert you when you walk away and leave the stylus I guess so you don't lose it.  This phone does a million things but I think I have barely scratched the surface (however, again, Googling the name of the phone and \"tips\" brought up pages and pages of tutorials and quick tips to help people get acquainted with the phone which was helpful).Whenever I get something new, I want to get hubby the same thing so I told him he may have a new phone as well in the near future.  He really doesn't need one as the only thing he does with his smart phone is make calls and send text messages (no internet, no games...due to lack of interest on his part and probably due to the fact that the screen is too small to see much anyway) but hopefully by the time I work at the WSOP and get some nice paychecks coming in the price will have dropped even more.It isn't like the old days when you bought an item and the item was complete and you were done with the purchase part when you paid for it.  These days you get a nice, shiny cell phone in the mail and you aren't done buying stuff for it.  First the phone, then the new SIM, then it needs a cover to protect it, then it needs a SD card to hold all of your music then better ear buds, then maybe a car charger, etc.  Yikes!The Note has a split screen (apparently, I haven't figured that part out yet) but I am not sure how useful it would be.  Even with my 14\" laptop, when I need two screens I end up using a second computer just to have enough screen space to work so splitting a relatively tiny 5\" screen into two sections doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.  Hmmm Finally, I saved my old smartphone and will get it unlocked.  This will be useful when we travel as when we end up in a different country we get local SIMs for our phones and use the local network to keep in touch with each other and our friends there.Now back to playing with my new phone..."},

{"title": "A Daily Adventure for March", "date": "Sunday, March 2, 2014", "text": "Hubby was complaining that I never take him anywhere.  He was also complaining that he only gets to see the Strip about once a month if he is lucky.  As locals, we mostly avoid the Las Vegas Strip and the hoards of tourists as much as possible unless we have guests that want to go there or unless I am doing a Strip volksmarch (which he doesn't find to be a relaxing tour of the Strip as I am walking as fast as possible while trying to avoid plowing through the tourist masses which means if I do walk the Strip, it is usually at 7am before there are many people out). So I told him that my goal is to do something entertaining for us each day during the month of March.  Our first adventure was to hit up the Southpoint Casino for their $3.95 steak and eggs breakfast just slightly after midnight on March 1st.  Today, March 2nd, we went to check out the new Linq shopping area on the Las Vegas Strip.  It is a really nice development without many tourists because it is so new.  The centerpiece of the development is the Linq which is kind of like the London Eye.  Although it won't open until April, the shopping area at it's base is coming together really well.  Here's some photos..."},
{"title": "5 Things to Start Off March", "date": "Saturday, March 1, 2014", "text": "In no particular order:It rained yesterday which was wonderful!  It was the first time we had rain in 85 days!!I did a lousy job of walking in February.  Between being sick and being lazy and it being windy and raining on one day I only walked 46 miles :(  Total miles needed to walk to reach my goal of walking 1000 miles this year: 863.I am also spending money as fast as I am making it.  Yesterday my friend showed me his new Samsung Galaxy Note cell phone/phablet and I loved it.  It is bigger than my cell phone but a bit smaller than my tablet and I figure I can carry one device (the Note) instead of three (my cell phone, tablet, and point and shoot camera).  So I hopped online and found that my cell carrier was offering the Note 2 for $466 so I ordered it.  I will see if I like it and if so I will sell my old cell phone, tablet, and camera and use that money to help recoup the cost of the new phone.Speaking of recouping money, after we bought our new refrigerator, I was hoping to sell our old refrigerator for a reasonable amount to help recoup the money of our new fridge.  Unfortunately I didn't do my homework and after checking the going price for similar refrigerators on Craigslist, I was disappointed to see that there were so many fridges for sale and the prices were really low.  We did sell our older but still in great condition fridge for $100 which was a lot less than I expected but at least we got it out of the garage.On a happier note, my tiny garden is growing like crazy!  I've never seen plants grow so quickly and so early in the year (then again we have never had a garden in the desert before)."},
{"title": "Keeping Our Guests Entertained", "date": "Thursday, February 27, 2014", "text": "We've had friends and family here this past week and will have a short breather before two other families descend next week. (On a side note, I recently asked hubby why we haven't been on a cruise in ages and pointed out that we need to go visit our families this spring and he was kind of non-interested.  He pointed out that we live in a vacation spot so there is more than enough to keep us entertained AND everyone comes here to visit us so we don't need to travel any more.  And I was like :/  ...but I digress...).The main thing we worry about when we have guests--besides keeping them fed--is keeping them entertained.  Here's what we do:We always point them in the direction of the \"main attractions\" if they haven't been to Las Vegas before (Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon, The Strip, Fremont, a buffet, gambling, shopping, a Vegas show, nightclubs, etc).We tell them about Tix4Tonight kiosks which sell highly discounted tickets for good shows in Las Vegas.  If they want a less expensive show we get them free show tickets from ShowTickets4Locals.We tell them all about the free and cheap entertainment locals love: free bingo, $1 bowling, discount day at the movies, free rodeo shows at SouthPoint, discount shopping at the Goodwill or the swap meet, etc.We also check the calendar of local events each week--there can be everything from community fun runs to Scottish Dancers to dog shows to just about everything else eventually....this is a very active place.If there is a major event in town we tell them about it as well (or more often, that may be the reason that they came) like NASCAR week, the National Finals Rodeo, World Series of Poker, etc.There is also plenty of \"normal\" activities to do such as water parks, roller skating, pick-up soccer games, etc.We also keep a list of kids activities on hand as well.  We have a really popular hands-on kids museum, some wonderful parks--many with water features kids can play in, a candy factory with free tours, a small petting zoo, outside movies, kids activities at the library, etc.And a list of adult activities: there are a number of shooting ranges here as well as golf courses, we are within driving distance of \"Area 51\" and some ghost towns, and there is just about everything else people could want to do from racing exotic cars to driving bulldozers for fun.Finally, while hubby always has food made for our guests, we also point them in the direction of good restaurants, generally of the Asian variety (great Filipino food, dim sum, etc).It's really easy to keep our guests entertained in Las Vegas--often for free or cheap.  In fact, the problem is usually there there are too many things to cram into people's tight schedules when they come to visit!"},

{"title": "101 Tips: What to Do When You Are Hungry and Have No Food", "date": "Monday, February 17, 2014", "text": "Quite a while back I wrote this blog post about what to do when you were hungry and needed food.  I figured it's about time that I update this post with both more tips and newer information.  Here's what to do if you are hungry and need food:Apply for SNAP (otherwise known as food stamps) if you qualify.  While the processing may take a bit of time, you may be able to get emergency SNAP benefits until your regular benefits come through.Apply for WIC if you qualify.Call 211 and find out what food resources areavailable in your community.  You can find the service online here.Visit your local food bank or food pantry toacquire needed (free) food.Find out where the hot meals are served in yourcommunity (these are usually for homeless and others in need and are oftenhosted at various places like churches and community centers around the community). Ask at your local church to find out what foodprograms they have available (this can range from food pantries to gift cardsor vouchers for use at local grocery stores). Visit your local Salvation Army.  This organization often combines a hot mealprogram with a food pantry and other food services for those in need.Check out your local Goodwill.  Not only is this a great place to shop forclothes and household items, but sometimes they sell highly discounted fooditems and some even have a food bank for those in need. Shop at your local $1 store or 99 cent store forfrozen, dry, and perishable foods.See if your town has a bakery thrift store whichsells day old and over run bakery items for cheap.Shop your local farmer’s market at the end ofthe day when you are most likely to get good prices on produce and other itemsthe farmer doesn't want to pack up and haul home.Shop loss leaders at your local grocery stores(these are highly discounted items that are meant to draw shoppers into thestores).Pay attention to when your local store has “caselot” sales.  Often you can buy cases ofitems you use (canned tomatoes, etc) for very cheaply this way.Buy less processed versions of the items you useas these are usually cheaper (ie: a bag of dried beans is cheaper than a can ofbeans, a bag of rice is cheaper than Minute Rice, etc).Cruise by the discount areas of your grocerystore for good deals (there is usually a discount bakery rack on the far side of the storefrom the bakery, there may be a produce rack with slightly blemished produce,etc).Buy generic or store brands if they arecheaper.  Most are usually just as goodas the popular, much-advertised items but are priced lower.Spend you limited money on items that give youthe most “bang for the buck”.  Eggs,beans, peanut butter, bananas…basically cheaper foods that are reasonablyhealthy, reasonably, cheap, and reasonably filling.Shop with coupons and peruse the sale ads (bycombining coupons with sales you can sometimes get items for free!).Pay attention to unit pricing when shopping,sometimes the biggest box is more expensive than buying a couple of smaller boxesif you break the cost down by ounces or pounds.Make a price book.  Each time you grocery shop, record the pricesof each item you buy.  This way you cantell when an item is really on sale and you can notice trends (either upward ordownward) in pricing.Shop ethnic grocery stores where you can usually find many popular staples for very little money compared to a regular grocery store.Check out the prices in the bulk bin area of your store.  Often you can buy grains and other foods in bulk this way and save money over buying the item in a package.Try dumpster diving.  This is popular in some areas and localdivers can tell you where to find the best dumpsters (usually food is thrownout just because it has reached its expiry date but it is still good).  Also, there is a lot of information on this topic online.Grow your own fruit, vegetables, and nuts.  For the cost of seeds and a bit of soil youcan end up with pounds and pounds of fruit and vegetables.If you don’t have your own land to grow food on,see if your community has a P-Patch. These are community agriculture programs that give people a low costspace (and often the tools, water, etc) to grow their own food.If you have the space and ability, considergrowing your own animals for consumption. Chickens and rabbits are relatively easy, pigs a bit more difficult, and cows moreso but this is an excellent way to fill up your freezer each year.Pick wild foods when they are in season.  Many areas have blackberries, mushrooms,nuts, wild apple trees, and other produce available on public land just for thetaking.Forage for other, less common, wild edibles suchas dandelion greens, cat tails, etc. Find info online for how to do this.Consider fishing.  Once the cost of the license and gear isfigured in, you can still come out ahead if you have the time and skill to fishoften. Note that for this and other licenses needed below you should ask if you can get a discount if you are a youth, senior, disabled person, veteran, etc.Consider shell fishing.  If you live near the ocean, oysters, clams,and crabs are easy to catch.  Lobstersand shrimp are a bit more difficult but with diligent effort you will come outahead over buying these items at retail.  This will also require a license in most cases.Consider hunting.  This is another sport/hobby which will incursome expense to start but over time will repay you in spades.  This will also require a license in most cases.Learn how to process your own food: freezingitems for a long shelf life, smoking meat, canning fruits and vegetables,making jellies and preserves, etc.Ask local farmers if you can glean their fieldsafter the harvest.  There is usuallyplenty of produce left on the vine even after a farm has been harvested.Try u-picking fruit and vegetables at a localfarm.See if your community has a CSA (community supported agriculture program) which will giveyou loads of produce for little money.  You can find local CSAs here.Skip restaurants.  For the price of one meal out at a middlingrestaurant, you can buy groceries for a week.If you do eat out, consider splitting a meal(with the huge troughs of food they serve in restaurants these days neither ofyou will go hungry). A couple of other rules for eating out: skip thebeverages and drink water instead, skip desserts as well since these tend to bereally over-priced, and consider if you really need an appetizer as the mealitself is usually pretty big.Before you head out to spend money at a restaurantof any kind, check online for coupons and discounts (Google the restaurant name and coupons and see what comes up).Check your receipt to see if you can take asurvey and get some free food (on the other hand, if you have no money, pick upreceipts—usually at fast food places in the garbage—call and do the survey, put down thecoupon code, and score some free food).Hit up up the $1 menu at afast food place.  It isn’t great food butit will keep you from going hungry for very little money.Pay attention to fast food place specials tostretch your money even more ($5 Subway special, two pieces of Chicken atPopeye’s on Tuesdays for 99 cents, three tacos for $1 at Del Taco on Thursdays,etc).Do some internet research and see how othershave managed to feed themselves on very little money (examples here, here, andhere).Visit reddit and see what resources they have(this ranges from good info on cheap cooking to assistance to random acts ofpizza).Cook from scratch.  This stretches your dollars much further thanbuying pre-made, heavily packaged food.If you have very little food to use to cook fromscratch, make soup.  This stretches evenvery little food even further.Don’t let food go to waste, eat all of yourleftovers (leftover dinners usually make a particularly nutritious breakfast orlunch).Let your friends and family know that you wouldbe happy to take any food items they don’t want (from leftovers to excessgarden produce, etc).  Eventually youwill be the person they think of when they have extra or come across a greatsale at the store.When fruit gets old, don’t toss it out.  Over ripe bananas make great banana bread,old apples make great applesauce, etc.Shop seasonally for food for the bestprices—watermelon in late summer is much cheaper than an imported watermelon inJanuary (ditto for strawberries, etc).Shop after holidays for the best prices on someitems (like a very cheap turkey after Christmas, candy after Valentine’s Day,etc).When you are cooking, use all parts of thefruit/vegetable/animal.  In Chinesecooking you will see every part of the pig used for food—from the snout to tail.  Most old-time cooks will use allparts of a plant—sliced steamed beets then beet tops in stews, etc.Trade work for food.  Offer to sweep the parking lot or clean thewindows of a restaurant in exchange for food.Get a job—even a part time job—that offers afree meal on each day that you work (like at a restaurant, coffee shop, nursing home, etc)Get a Costco or Sam’s Club card and travelaround the food section of these stores eating samples; a couple of rounds willnearly make a meal.Look for free food samples at grocery stores,mall stores, and at community events.Attend events where free food isprovided—weddings, community meetings, church socials, parties, funerals, etc.Check out Freecycle, Freegans, and the free section ofCraigsList and see if there are food items someone is giving away (note you canalso collect up free or found items, fix them up, then resell them for money tobuy food).Visit friends and family who will offer you afree meal (grandma’s and aunties are great for this!).Panhandle. Yes this is socially stigmatized but if you have absolutely no money andno food and you have kids to feed, this may be the quickest way to drum up somefast cash.If you have served any time at all in themilitary, contact your local Veteran’s organization and see what free foodresources they offer (this includes the VA, state veteran's office, VFW halls, DAV, etc).If you are a senior citizen see what mealprograms you qualify for in your community (this can range from Meals on Wheels delivered to yourhome to free lunches at the senior center).If you are a tribal member, see what foodresources are available to you (your tribe’s social service office can helpwith this).If you are an immigrant, check to see if yourlocal immigrant center offers free meals (this is particularly common atChinese community centers, etc).If you have children, sign them up for free orreduced meals at school.Check to see if you children’s school has asummer or weekend meal program (these programs give kids either hot meals or foodto take home with them when school isn't in session).Google for ideas.  People are continually coming up with new andinteresting ways to stretch a dollar when it comes to food.Write to food manufacturers if you like theirproduct.  Manufactures like to receivefeedback like this and usually respond with a nice letter and loads of couponsor even free samples.On the other hand, be sure to rant about a food product if you have just cause (this works when corresponding with food companies as well as at restaurants). Usually the company wants to make it right and will reward your efforts with free products, coupons, etc.Find freesample places online (example here) and sign up to receive free food andhousehold goods samples.Sign up for free birthday meals.  Granted this only comes around once a yearbut by signing up you will get an inbox full of coupons for freebies onyour birthday.Take advantage of other freebies as they comeavailable such as Ben and Jerry’s free cone day, free meals for veteran’s onVeteran’s day, etc.Stretch your meager meals by hosting a potluckwith friends.  If everyone brings a dishto share you will have a wide range of dishes to eat for very little money onyour part.Cook things from scratch that most people thinkneed to be store bought (yogurt is so simple and cheap to make that buyingstore-bought is ridiculous.  Ditto forbread (depending on the price in your local area), etc.Look at your daily habits and change them.  If you buy coffee each day at Starbucks, makeit at home instead.  If you eat out forlunch every day, bring your own lunch from home.  If you have a junk food habit, make your own junk food at home instead of stopping by the store.Make space in your home to set up a storage pantry soyou will have a place to store items you buy on sale or in bulk (this doesn't have to be in the kitchen, it can be in the garage, basement, a bedroom closet, etc.).Consider buying a freezer (you don't have tobuy it at retail, you can often find good deals for these on CraigsList).  This way you can store food that you buy onsale for a longer time.Volunteer somewhere where, in addition to doinggood for others, you can get a free meal for yourself (like at a soup kitchen,homeless shelter, etc).Take a multi-vitamin. A bottle of vitamins will cost around $10 for a month. This will help make up for any nutritional deficiencies you may have when eating so cheaply.Think attitude and presentation. My Depression-era grandmother could feed the family a simple plate of beans and rice and we would think we were feasting. Mostly it was her positive attitude (\"look at the wonderful meal I cooked just for you\") and the presentation (beautiful plates, multiple \"courses\" like we were eating in a fancy restaurant when we were actually eating bean soup, beans and tortillas, beans and hocks, etc).Look for cheaper alternatives. If you were used to eating T Bones steaks, find a much cheaper cut of beef and roast it for hours until it is tender. If you were used to getting skinless, boneless chicken breasts for dinner, buy a whole chicken on sale and use every part of it.Learn to barter. You can trade just about anything (ie: friend shoots a deer, you offer to butcher it for him and keep part of the animal) and with enough practice as well as contacts with other barterers, you could very well end up with much more than you started with.Consider ways to “win” free food (for example,playing free online poker can win you gift certificates for restaurants).If someone is going to buy you a gift, tactfullylet them know that a gift certificate to Walmart or a grocery store would bemuch appreciated.  On the flip side, ifyou are making a gift to a friend or college student consider these same giftcertificates as it is a great way to provide them food in a “gifty” sort ofway.If you are a college student, check with studentservices to see if they have free food resources that you can take advantageof.  With so many needy studentsattending college these days, schools often have food pantries set up just fortheir students.Become a secret shopper, a restaurant reviewer,or otherwise “employed” in a way that will net you free food.Although the days of the lofty expense accountare (mostly) long gone, be aware of your employer’s policy regardingmeals.  Often times if you are away fromthe office working during lunch you may be compensated or reimbursed for your meals.Check the prices on raw chicken at the grocerystore versus a cooked chicken in the deli. Often the deli chickens are cheaper and you can stretch these birds forthree or four meals (roast chicken, chicken tacos, chicken pot pie, and chickensoup).See what “freebie” food is available as you doyour daily errands.  Many grocery storesoffer free coffee in the morning.  Sometire companies are famous for their free popcorn for customers.When you are on vacation, look at all of youroptions for meals.  Generally the mostconvenient spot—right in the middle of the tourist area or attraction—is themost expensive.  Taking a detour outsideof the tourist area can net you some big savings if you eat where the locals eat.As long as you are on vacation, throw in acouple of food factory/winery/brewery tours. These are usually free, interesting, and provide free samples at theend.  If you are out of town and staying at a hotel,make your first stop the local $1 store where you can pick up snacks andbeverages to keep in your room.  This isa much cheaper option than buying from room service or the mini bar when youare hungry.Eat less. I’m not sure where the mantra to eat five meals a day came from but the majority of Americans (where obesity rates are heading towards 40%) don’tneed to eat 3000-4000 calories a day. People can get by perfectly fine on two solid meals a day, or two solidmeals and soup for dinner each day, and still be perfectly healthy.If you have some sort of membership that allowsyou to buy food (everything from a Costco membership to being a military memberand shopping at the commissary) take advantage of this if and when the cost ofshopping at these places is less than you would pay at a regular store.Drink tap water. The majority of the world would be thrilled to be able to drink safe,healthy water out of their tap.  This iseasily available in the US and is a far cry better for you than soda, juice,etc.Cut back (or reduce completely) your foodaddictions.  Whether it is soda or junkfood or Starbucks or whatever your food/beverage addiction is, you will bebetter off (and have more money in your pocket) if you cut these out.If you are going to be gone for the day—whetherto school, work, or just hanging out—carry food made at home with you even ifyou don’t think you will need it.  Thiswill keep you from running to a restaurant or store to pick up something whenyou are starving.Try to avoid specialized food if at allpossible.  You don’t need highlyprocessed freeze dried meals for backpacking when you can make the same stuffyourself at home.  You don’t need faddiet bars and drinks when common sense eating will work better (and cheaper.And healthier).Find out if your local cooking school or culinary institute offers very cheap meals (students get to practice this way and the public gets good, low cost meals).Call the National Hunger Hotline for food resources in your area.And finally the most loathed idea from my lastpost on this topic yet anthropologically consistent with human behavior sincethe dawn of time—go on a date for a free meal!"},
{"title": "101 Resources If You Are Flat Broke, Homeless, Jobless, Etc.", "date": "Sunday, February 16, 2014", "text": "**Note that this post has once again been update in 2019.  Find it here.This is anupdate of a post I did back in 2010 which is probably one of the most viewedposts on this blog.  I figured it’s abouttime to update this resource list and add newer information and additionalresources that could be helpful to those in need.First,however, a couple of clarifications based on comments on the previouspost.  For starters, I have never beenhomeless by circumstance.  I’ve been homeless by choice for about a year and ahalf and, while I always had a safety net (namely money, some sort of income,and lot of family and friends to fall back on if needed) I am well aware thatthere is a huge difference between choosing to be homeless (and traveling inour case) and being destitute and homeless and having no resources at all.Second, thisis meant to be a list of helpful information, not a cure-all forhomelessness.  I’ve worked with thehomeless through a non-profit I founded some years ago as well as inconjunction with well-established non-profit agencies--and some really amazingindividuals who have dedicated themselves to helping the homeless—and I’ve cometo the conclusion that there is no \"cure\" for homelessness.  Help can be provided and resources given butthe overall causes of homelessness—mental illness, substance abuse, fleeingfrom abuse, job loss, literally having no one to depend on for help, havingbeen in prison or on a sex offender list, bad luck, economic downsizing, PTSD,etc—are too vast and varied to “fix”.So here is my small effort to provide some hopefully helpful information for those in need...Basics.  Have identification if possible.  It is hard to function in today’ssociety without some sort of identification. A driver’s license, state ID card, or passport are considered definitivesources of ID.  Having your birthcertificate and social security card are also important.  Homeless advocates can often help with procuring these documents if needed.Basics.  It isn’t so unusual to see homeless people withcell phones these days.  It is a greatway to keep in touch with people, can allow you to receive calls about jobs,and can be used to call 911 in an emergency (note that even an old cell phone that doesn’thave a calling plan can often be used to call 911 in an emergency so if youhave nothing else this may be something to consider).  Cheap cell phone plans can be found at Ting,Republic Wireless, etc.  Also, low income folks can qualify for a free government-sponsored cell phone plan (info here).Basics.   It is difficult to do anything without anaddress (like apply for benefits or a job) so if possible, try to get anaddress where you can receive mail (a friend or family member’s house even ifyou aren’t officially living there for example). Sometimes homeless service centers will allow people to use theiraddress to receive mail.  PO boxes and private mail boxes are also an option but these have a monthly or yearly fee and you will still need to provide proof of a physical address in order to apply for them.Basics.  At the first sign that you will be losing your home/income, go to your local welfare office and sign up for whatever you qualify for.  This may include food stamps, unemployment, subsidized housing, Medicare, cash assistance, etc.  Often times it takes a while for these benefits to get started and, unfortunately, the waiting list for subsidized housing can be years long, but it is important to get any aid you can, as soon as you can get it.Basics.  When you find yourself in a difficult position, another great resource is to call 211.  This is a nation-wide number like 911 which connects you to social service help in your community.  They can tell you where local shelters and food banks are and provide other useful information as well (you can find 211 here online).Basics.  Storage is often an issue for the homeless.  Carrying your stuff, especially importantdocuments or anything else of value, is often difficult and/or dangerous whenyou are living on the streets.  Somehomeless shelters or service centers can provide lockers for storage.  Another idea is to rent a locker at a bowlingalley (usually less than $50 per year) to store important items; lockers may also be available at bus and train stations.  Renting a storage unit is another option but generally the cost can be quite high.Basics.  If you have/can get a free checking/savings account at a local bank or credit union, do so.  It is super helpful to have a way to cash checks and receive money (ie: via PayPal, etc) in a way that won't cost you anything.  Of course you can do these things at Walmart or check cashing places but there is usually a fee associated with each transaction.Basics.  If you are homeless you need gear.  Even something as basic as a backpack to carry a couple of changes of clothes around with you is something.  Expanding your gear to include a tent, sleeping bag, and cooking items is even better.  Check out 'shopping' below for ideas on acquiring this gear.Basics.  When you are camping in a squat and wondering where your next meal is coming from, your last concern may be getting an education but this isn't something to discount.  With an education (even just getting a GED, or spending your library time learning things online) you can greatly improve your chances of getting out of the mess you are currently in.  For more information on getting a GED contact your local community college or literacy organization.Basics.  This can be one of the more difficult things to acquire for those in need but the more friends, family, and positive connections you have in the community, the better off you will be.  Personal connections with people who can help you out of a hard spot, provide job leads, even take in your mail or let you store stuff at their place is very valuable.  Note these need to be positive people, not losers who will drag you down with them.Food.  Find out where hot meals are served in your community for the homeless.  These spots often change daily and can range from breakfast and lunch at the Salvation Army to dinners cooked and served at churches or homeless service centers once a week.Food.  Visit a community food pantry.  These places help those in need by providingfree food and occasionally other items (pet food, diapers, baby formula, etc).Food.  Stop by churches in your community and see what sort of food programs they have available for those in need.  Some provide hot meals, some provide gift certificates for local grocery stores, and others provide canned and non-perishable bags of food to those in need.Food.  Fast food places shouldn't be discounted.  Although you wouldn't want to eat there every day, the $1 menu can provide a quick, relatively hot meal for a buck or so.Food.  Dollar Stores and 99 cent stores have sprung up all over and most offer a food (dry/refrigerated/frozen) section.  For a few dollars you can create a complete, relatively healthy meal.Food.  Free community events and community meetings often provide snacks of some sort--everything from small appetizers to more elaborate food creations.Food.  Dumpster diving is a tried and true way to procure food--generally food that is still in great condition but may be expired or left over.  Local divers will be able to point you to the stores with the best (cleanest, safest, etc) dumpsters to dive in.Food.  Forging for wild edibles or gleaning a farmer's field is another way to procure free food.  Of course it depends on your skills and knowledge and having a bit of experience but everything from finding wild mushrooms and berries to fishing or asking to glean a field after harvest can provide some free food for you.Food.  Another source of free food is free samples.  With an old Costco card or a free tour through a food factory among other things (special events at the mall, etc) you can often cobble together enough food to make up a complete free meal.Food.  Occasionally you may be able to barter with a restaurant for a free meal.  By offering to trade a window-washing or parking lot sweeping job for a meal you will at least be able to score a meal and possibly a source of free future meals.Shelter.  Find out where the local homeless sheltersare.  Some people rely on these places,others wouldn't touch these places with a ten foot pole but at least knowingwhere they are is useful, especially during times of particularly bad weather.Shelter.  Squats--official or, most often unofficial--or places where the homeless camp out together can be found in both rural and urban areas.  Finding these places is usually done via word of mouth but there can be dangers associated with these places.  Use them accordingly.Shelter.  Many homeless, especially in suburban and rural areas, set up their own camps either with or without other people.  With some camping gear this is often a cheap option for shelter.Shelter.  Couchsurfing is another option for those without shelter, either unofficially--crashing on a friend's or relative's couch until you wear out your welcome--or officially via websites made specifically (usually for travelers) for providing a free couch for a night or two (ie: couchsurfing or warmshowers).Shelter.  It may be possible to trade some of your time or skills for a free place to sleep.  Everything from offering to work for a farmer for space to sleep in a barn to trading live-in jobs skills (elder sitting, babysitting, housesitting, etc) for free room and board is possible.Shelter.  If you are homeless but have a car, your car will be your most likely place to shelter for free.  Some communities have car parks for the homeless that offer a bit of security.  In other cases you will need to use your knowledge and judgement to find safe places to park where you won't be hassled by the police or those who wish to do you harm.  Note that many Walmarts are fine with people parking overnight in their parking lots.Shelter.  Ask for shelter.  Occasionally you may find a church that will let you sleep in their basement or a farmer who will let you camp in their field just for the asking.Shelter.  Find out if there are shelter options for those in need in your community.  These can range from transitional housing programs to \"half-way houses\" to other community-funded shelter programs.Shelter.  See if your local church or homeless service center offers free nights at local motels.  Sometimes these organizations can provide vouchers for a free night or two to get people off the streets at least for a little while.Shelter.  Abandoned buildings, warehouses, I've even heard of people crashing in some out-of-the-way janitor's closet at a business in order to seek shelter.  These options provide more shelter than being outside and exposed to the elements but they can also lead to trespassing charges and legal entanglements so use these options with caution.Special situation.  If you or your spouse has ever served in the armed forces, for any amount of time, be sure to check with the Veteran's Administration to see what free benefits you are entitled to.  Info here and here.  Note that in addition to the VA, many communities have a range of vet service centers (DAV, VFW halls, county vet service centers, etc).Special situation.  If you are fleeing from an abusive situation, you may be able to find shelter and other resources at your local abused woman's shelter (Google abuse shelter and your city to find the names of local shelters).  Also more info here.Special situation.  If you are a member of a registered tribe, check with your tribal service center to see what services/benefits you qualify for.Special situation.  If you are a seniorcitizen (and the age for this varies from 50+ to 62+ to 65+ depending on theservice/agency) check out your local senior service center to see what seniorresources are available in the community (this can be everything from housingto meal programs to medical care to transportation, etc).Special situation.  If you are a minority, check and see if there are any resources in your community that can help you (this can range from minority employment programs to minority student programs, etc).Special situation.  If you are an immigrant check and see if your city has specific programs to help you find resources (this can be as generic as an immigrant assistance center to as specific as a Chinese cultural association that provides translators and assistance signing up for government programs).Special situation.  If you are a teenager, Google \"teen homeless\" and your location for assistance.  There are a number of organizations--both national and local--that provide homeless services specifically for teenagers which range from meals to teen shelters to job programs, etc.Special situation.  If you have a disability, go to your local Social Security office and sign up for disability payments/services (note this can be a long and frustrating process but there may be services in the community to help you with the applications).  Being disabled may also put you higher on the list for subsidized housing and other disabled services (transportation, medical care, etc).Special situation.  If you are a college student, check and see if your college has special services for homeless students.  This is a bigger problem than most people realize so many colleges and universities have begun to offer a range of programs and services to help out their students in need.Special situation.  If you are homeless with children, see if your community offers programs which can help both you and them.  These can range from free daycare for homeless children to feeding programs, even during the summer when school is out.Medical.  Check to see if your community has a free or sliding scale clinic if you are in need of medical care.  This can greatly reduce the cost of medical care and can take care of medical situations before they turn into emergencies.Medical.  Keep your eyes and ear open for notices of health fairs in your community.  These may be offered annually and provide free medical and dental services and even necessary vaccines to those in need.Medical.  Know that if ifyou have an emergency medical issue you can go to the ER of your local hospitaland they must treat/stabilize you even if you can’t pay (you will get bills after the fact, however.  Ask the hospital billing department about their charity care services when you receive the bills).Medical.  See what free and cheap services your local health department/health district office provides.  This can range from free vaccines to free family planning resources.Medical.  If you have a chronic medical problem that you need medicine for, check out this website and/or check with the maker of the drugs you need and find out if they have a free or reduced cost prescription program.  Also, if you do see a medical doctor for your issue you can ask them for free samples of the prescription you need.  Note also that Walmart and Costco (even if you are not a member) provide a number of inexpensive generic prescription drugs.Medical.  If you qualify, sign up for Medicaid/Medicare which will cover a great deal of your medical costs.Medical.  Consider medical and dental schools for free or reduced cost care.  This is particularly common at dental schools where supervised students \"practice\" on you.  You get free or greatly reduced-price care while they get experience and training (their instructors, of course, will be watching everything they do).Medical.  Not always a viable option, but getting into drug and other trials for whatever ails you could net you the care you need as well as payment for your time and services.  Info here and here.Medical.  Visit your local Planned Parenthood or sexual health center and find out about getting free or reduced-cost birth control (when you are in the midst of crisis, the last thing you need is a baby!).Medical.  Preventative health care is your best defense against becoming ill and needing expensive medical care.  Keeping your feet clean and blister free is one example.Transportation.  Walking is often the transportation of choice for those in need as it is a free way to get from place to place.  Good sturdy shoes will greatly improve your ability to walk long distances.Transportation.  Next up the scale of inexpensive transportation is having a bicycle.  Bikes may need a bit of knowledge to keep in good repair but they are basically free modes of transportation.Transportation.  Check and see if your city offers free or reduced cost bus passes for those in need.  Often you can get a month's worth of motorized transport for free or very cheap.Transportation.  If you need to travel further from home, consider taking one of the cheap buses that have recently popped up.  These include Megabus, Bolt Bus, and GoTo Bus among others.Transportation.  Check out your local CraigsList for ride share opportunities which may net you a free ride for the cost of doing the driving.Transportation.  Hitchhiking and train hopping are as old as cars and trains.  These can provide free transportation but at your peril (both legal and physical...use at your own risk).Transportation.  Cars can often be both transportation and shelter for the homeless be beware that all legal requirements must be followed lest you end up with more problems and legal fees than you can handle (this means having current registration and insurance, taking care of any tickets, etc).Transportation.  Not that many people in need are likely to hop a plane but if you need to go a great distance at a low cost, be sure to check out the low cost airlines that fly in your area (such as Spirit, Allegiant, JetBlue, etc).Transportation.  Mopeds and motorcycles can be lower cost options than driving a car.  Gas costs are lower, insurance costs are lower, and maintenance is lower as well.  Be sure to wear a helmet when you ride and, as with cars, keep your specialized license (if needed), insurance, and registration up to date.Transportation.  Car-pooling, ride shares, and other car-sharing programs are popular in some areas and can provide lower cost transportation than having your own car.Income.  If you qualify, consider JobCorps, a government program which provides young people housing, job skills, a paycheck, and other benefits.Income.  In years past, those in need often joined the military which provided them housing, job skills, meals, medical care, and a paycheck.  It is much more difficult to join these days but still an option for those who qualify.Income.  Panhandling is, unfortunately, a fairly lucrative proposition for those in need.  Although it may be illegal in some areas, many have turned to panhandling as an alternative to day labor for some quick money.Income.  Another method for trading what you have (skills, material goods, etc) for what you need is bartering.  With practice, you can make some good trades that will, at least, provide for some necessities, and at most, could turn into a full-time career.Income.  Earning an online income these days is not so out of the realm of possibility for those in need.  With a free blogging platform (Blogger, for example), a free AdSense account, and a free PayPal account, you can be on your way to earning money online (not to mention selling on eBay or CraigsList, etc).  Example here.Income.  If youhave worked at all during the past year, don’t leave your tax refundbehind.  Many communities offer freeassistance with filling out and filing your tax return which can mean extramoney for you.Income.  Day labor is a popular way to make some quick cash with very little red tape.  There are official day labor spots (show up each morning at the office and see what jobs are available) and unofficial day labor gigs (note the many many people hanging around farms/Home Depot/etc waiting to see if a random person will give them a job for some quick cash).Income.  Simply Googling for ways to make quick cash can bring you lots of interesting info--everything from selling your blood to selling hand crafts on etsy (more info here).Income.  Use your trash picking and dumpster diving skills to find items that you can resell.  This is a popular way for people to make a bit of money and the selling part can be done anywhere--from a local street corner to online via CraigsList.Income.  A word of warning, when you are down and out some \"too good to be true\" job offers may appeal to you.  Don't fall for jobs that are illegal and/or immoral (selling drugs, prostitution, burglary, etc).  These are a one-way path to nowhere (and jail and death, etc).Housekeeping.  Use yourlocal library for all of the free resources it provides.  Check out free movies and books, utilizetheir free wi-fi and computers, hang out on particularly cold days to keepwarm, attend free events (sometimes these include free food), and take freeclasses (everything from knitting to computer skills classes).Housekeeping.  Shop thrift stores. You can find basically everything you need—from clothes to couches tofood and hygiene items—at many thrift stores. Check to see what days they offer additional discounts (senior ½ offday, blue ticket half off day, etc) and be sure to get there early for the bestchoices.Housekeeping.  Speaking ofthrift stores, the Goodwill store in your community may offer additionalservices—everything from English classes to job training courses to actual jobs for those in need.Housekeeping.  Staying  clean is another big concern when you arehomeless.  Some homeless service centersoffer free showers, paid showers can be had at truck stops andcounty/state/federal parks, and a day/month pass to the local swimming pool orYWCA/YMCA will also get you access to a shower. The old way of washing up—with a bucket of water or in alake/stream/river will also do the trick but not nearly as warmly.Housekeeping.  Keeping yourclothes clean—as anyone who is homeless or has been on the trail for a longtime can tell you—is difficult.  The laundromatis one option, washing clothes by hand and hanging them to dry is another (timeconsuming) option, and some churches and homeless service centers/shelters offerthe free use of laundry facilities for those in need.Housekeeping.  Just because you are homeless or broke, doesn't mean you should never do anything for fun.  Check local sources (online newspaper, local news magazines, etc) and see what sorts of free entertainment are available in your area (community fairs, concerts in the park, etc).Housekeeping.  Keeping your stuff in good repair is a cheaper option than replacing items that have been broken or damaged.  Keep a small sewing kit and some duct tape on hand to make quick repairs and extend the life of your gear and clothing.Housekeeping.  When you need things--from clothing and shoes to work materials and household goods--check Freecycle and CraigsList for free and cheap items.Housekeeping.  Many homeless centers, shelters, churches, and even homeless meal programs will provide free clothing, shoes, and hygiene items for those in need just for asking.Housekeeping.  Remember the mantra reduce, reuse, recycle.  So many people throw out things that are still usable and often in good condition.  This can work to your advantage if you do all three of these things--have minimal possessions, reuse your own things and things others have tossed out and recycle items you have or find in order to provide for your basic needs.Long-term fixes.  If part of your situation is due to drug or alcohol addiction, consider joining a free treatment program such as AA or NA. Long-term fixes.  If you nevergraduated from high school, consider getting your GED.  The assistance to get a GED is often providedfree of charge through community colleges, adult education programs, literacycouncils, etc.Long-term fixes.  Do not get into debt.  Being in debt--whether due to huge credit card bills or the massive money suck of payday lenders--will be like a noose around your neck.  If you can't afford something today, don't put yourself in the position of buying said item on credit and owing it tomorrow.Long-term fixes.  If you have legal problems--everything from outstanding tickets to outstanding warrants--be sure to take care of them ASAP.  If you can not afford to take care of these problems with money, ask about other options such as jail days instead of probation or community service as a way to pay off fines.Long-term fixes.  If you are in a bad way but you have the ability to attend college (ie: have graduated from high school or got a GED, have good SAT scores, etc) you might consider taking out student loans and attending college to get a marketable degree.  I generally don't recommend going into debt but in some cases, such as getting documented, marketable job skills, this may be a consideration.Long-term fixes.  Apply for every job you can no matter if it is a crap job or something you have no interest in.  It is easier to get another (better) job if you are currently employed.  In addition, if you can find a job with any sort of extra benefits (like a free meal if you work at a restaurant or all the coffee you can drink, etc) it is all the better for you.Long-term fixes.  Avoid the law if at all possible.  This means avoiding anything that can get you in trouble with the cops or court system (drugs, SOs with legal issues, having children you can't support, etc).Long-term fixes.  Volunteer.  You might wonder why, if you are in a bad way, someone would suggest you volunteer but by volunteering you will not only get some documented job skills, but you will be helping others (it will take your mind off your own problems!), and you may even get additional benefits (like a free meal if you volunteer at a soup kitchen, etc).Long-term fixes.  Cut out the vices.  Drinking, drugs, and smoking are expensive vices with no redeeming qualities.  By cutting these out of your life you will be healthier, clearer of mind, and have more money in your pocket.Long-term fixes.  Seek assistance for problems that keep you in a downward cycle.  If mental illness is an issue, seek out free or low cost mental health services in your community.  If the people you hang out with are the problem, change the things you do/people you hang out with.Other resources.  Check outyour local Salvation Army.  This is anexcellent resource in many communities as they provide meals, food to take withyou, a clothing bank, and other forms of assistance to help those in need.Other resources.  See if there is a list or directory of homelessresources in your community.  Thisdocument often provides lists of hot meals, places to get a free shower,homeless shelters, etc and can be found online, at local homeless shelters,etc. (Example here)Other resources.  There are lots and lots of online resources for the homeless and those in need.  Including this and this and this and this.Other resources.  See if your community has a homeless service center or a community resources center.  These places often encompass a number of services--everything from welfare sign ups to free counseling to job training, etc--to help those in need.Other resources.  If you have children, be sure to sign them up for anything they qualify for due to your economic circumstances (such as the free lunch program, the school's weekend food program, free children's dental services, etc).  Many schools--from pre-school to college--have homeless student programs to help those in need.Other resources.  See what what kind of help is available through your local utility company (gas company, water company, electric company, etc).  Some utility companies offer rebates for purchases, they may also offer free things such as free home weatherization programs, and some may provide assistance with paying utility bills for those in need. Other resources.  Move.  Many people don't want to leave an area they are comfortable in but if the place you are living has many negatives going for it (high unemployment rates, bad weather, too much violence, etc) consider relocating to a better area. Other resources.  Safety is even more important if you are homeless because you don't have the option of locking a door between you and the outside world.  Take additional safety precautions as you can to avoid common causes of street violence.Other resources.  Reddit is a wonderful online community that helps people out in a myriad of ways.  Everything from providing straight up assistance for those who ask to random acts of pizza to local subreddits where you can ask for specific help or assistance.Other resources.  Know your legal rights.  Being broke or homeless or jobless is already depressing enough.  Make sure you don't get legally railroaded because you don't know your rights or have no legal help for a problem you are experiencing.  Many communities have free legal services for those in need (examples from Seattle here, here, and here).Other resources.  Never stop learning.  These days nearly everything you need to learn can be found online and, without a doubt, knowledge and education can be your greatest resources for pulling yourself out of a bad situation.  There has never been a more egalitarian time in history where resources are available to everyone if they only know where to look and how to put the knowledge they gather into use.

{"title": "A Quick Update", "date": "Saturday, February 15, 2014", "text": "Here's what's happening around here...I've been sick as a dog for a couple of days.  Not the flu but some sort of yucky respiratory thing that has involved a lot of kleenex, a lot of Thera Flu, a lot of vitamin c, and a lot of sleeping.  Ugh.Happy belated Valentine's Day!  Hubby made me a card to celebrate the holiday as is our tradition then we went out for breakfast (free, with comps, of course) then I came home and went back to bed.I haven't walked for three days!  I will need to make this up as soon as I feel better since I want to get about a hundred miles of walking a month in.We got our tax return already--it took about a week and a half!  That was fast!The yogurt I made a few days ago was kind of watery (sometimes the culture isn't so great and it comes out less firm) so I simply lined a colander with coffee filters and drained the yogurt for a few hours and now it is really firm like Greek yogurt.And a few interesting articles: about Abercrombie, about a very cool girl, about traveling solo as a woman, and some inspiring photos.That's all.  I'm off to take another nap."},
{"title": "I Saved $250 Yesterday!", "date": "Thursday, February 13, 2014", "text": "A few days ago we got our semi-annual car insurance bill in the mail.  We pay our car insurance twice a year and our house insurance is with the same company (this bill is paid annually by our mortgage company).  Anyway, I was disappointed to see that our bill increased yet again--it seems to go up about 10% each time we get a new bill!--so I decided to do something about it.First I called a couple of other insurance companies to get quotes for bundled auto and house insurance.  One company in particular had lower rates than what we were paying so I carted myself over to our insurance agent's office and asked what could be done in order to stay with them.  I told the lady that we had been with her insurance company for nearly 30 years and it doesn't seem right that another company would give us better rates than what her company could give us.She got busy on her computer and we were able to reduce our home owner's insurance from $408 a year to $274 a year by increasing our deductible from $1000 to $5000 (the $5000 deductible was what was quoted by the new insurance company which is what made the cost lower).  We are happy with the cost savings and we were OK with upping our deductible because basically the insurance is covering something catastrophic that happens to our house.  We are more than happy to handle smaller problems ourselves, mostly because if you do file any sort of insurance claim it makes your future insurance costs sky rocket.  So that part was taken care of.Then she went to work on our car insurance.  We have one old car with liability insurance only.  Our newest bill was $353 for six months (car insurance rates in general are REALLY high in Las Vegas because there are so many wrecks here...crazy drivers!).  By reducing our coverages from 25/50/100 to 15/30/100 and removing us from the higher rate \"gold plan\"...whatever that is...we were able to reduce our cost to $309 every six months.  I think these coverages will work fine for us.  If we had a lot of assets we would probably keep the higher coverages since this insurance only kicks in if we are at fault for an accident and get sued.  We were also able to remove the uninsured motorist coverage also which basically covers our medical costs if an uninsured driver hits us but since we have excellent full coverage health insurance this wasn't needed. Finally, we can reduce our car insurance costs by another $10-$20 per premium period if hubby takes a senior driver course since he is 65 years old.  I checked on the course, which will cost only $10, and will probably sign him up soon.  The insurance lady said that once he takes the class, our rates will be reduced for three years at which time he will need to take the class again.  Note that hubby WAS NOT happy when I told him he was going to take a senior driving class (he still thinks he is 35 not 65) but I will go with him and force him to learn something new (when I worked with seniors some years ago the course taught them how to compensate for lack of motion as they get older--like using mirrors instead of turning around to look behind them which is more difficult as you age--and decreased hearing ability, etc).  Anyway he is an old dog but he will learn some new tricks in the name of reducing the amount we pay for insurance!"},
{"title": "Greek for Dinner", "date": "Tuesday, February 11, 2014", "text": "Yesterday hubby said he wanted a gyro (donair for my Canadian friends) for dinner tonight.  Since our local grocery store had a gallon of milk on sale for $2.89 (a loss leader), we picked up the milk and I used half of the gallon to make yogurt.  With a bit of this yogurt I made tzatziki sauce (really simple, just mix yogurt with garlic powder and dill).  Then we walked to the $1 store because they usually have naan bread which we use for the Greek sandwiches.  Unfortunately they didn't have naan bread today and I didn't want to buy it at the regular grocery store because it sells for like $4 a package of six pieces of bread. I told hubby I would just make the naan myself but he didn't look happy about it (FWIW I've tried making naan bread before and they usually come out like hockey pucks).  So I hopped online and found this recipe.  I used a bit of the yogurt I had made, followed the instructions exactly, and the naan came out perfectly!  Soft, pliable, tasty...hubby will have a nice dinner tonight!"},
{"title": "How We Live Well on $24,000 a Year: 101 Tips", "date": "Monday, February 10, 2014", "text": "Hubby still can't believe that we can live so well on $24,000 a year.  Before we decided to sell everything and travel, our income was closer to six figures a year.  Then we sold everything--house and nearly everything in it--to travel for a year or so and our income dropped dramatically (to the tune of both of us living on hubby's military pension).  At the time that we were traveling we didn't notice that our income was so small because we had no bills besides our cell phones and a storage shed.Now that we are living a more \"normal\" life, we tend to have many of the same bills as normal people--mortgage, electric bill, cable, etc.  With a full year of living this way, we now know that we can live well on a very small income (something we would have not thought possible in the past).  Here's how we do it:It's just the two of us; all of the kids are grown and employed and independent (this makes a huge difference in our bills!).We don't have pets.  This can be a big expense for people but since pets can be like their children they are loathe to change this situation.  Since we aren't home much we don't think it would be fair to have pets but not pay any attention to them.We share one car which we paid cash for 13 years ago and we will drive it until it is dead dead (having a reliable car with no car payment is a big savings; most people have multiple cars and multiple car payments).We only have liability insurance on the car because it is so old.We keep the car in good repair (regular oil changes, new tires when they become worn, other fixes as needed). Hubby has Medicare for his health insurance and I have very inexpensive medical insurance through the military (medical costs/insurance is often one of people's biggest expenses in the US).We have no debt.  It takes a big income to pay off massive credit card debt, student loan debt, etc.We live on a fixed income so we know exactly how much we have to spend each month (hubby's military pension and Social Security).  We don't buy now and think we can pay later with a better job or bigger raise.I take occasional freelance jobs as they come up (I do freelance gigs for my old clients and have enjoyed working temporary jobs at Christmas time and at the WSOP for extra cash).We put a bit of money into savings each month (this can be used for travel, helping out the kids, big purchases, etc).We also have an emergency fund which has saved us on more than one occasion.We moved from Seattle to a very inexpensive part of the country (Las Vegas) where the overall cost of living is much lower.Since we moved to both a tourist mecca and a retirement mecca, the options for free and low-cost entertainment options are huge (you really can't be bored here!).We bought a small house (which is a big savings in mortgage and utilities and furnishings over having a big house).We also bought our house when the market was really depressed so we got a great deal on a nearly new house with a super low interest rate (which means we are paying lots less than people who rent!).We use over-the-air antennas for our TVs and do not have cable TV.We do have a monthly Netflix subscription because we found this was cheaper than making a couple of trips to the library each week.I do A LOT of reading so I download free e-books from our local library.We also use our local library for other services--checking our books and movies and music, attending free events (concerts and movies), using inter-library loan for my genealogy research, etc.We do have internet at our house but I call and grovel after each special deal is over so we get a cut rate price on our monthly internet costs.For the first year or so of living in our house we read our electric and gas meter religiously and made sure we were conserving gas, water, and electricity as much as possible (it only took us a week or so to figure out that we couldn't leave our air conditioning on all day and all night and still have a reasonable electric bill).We tend to hang out in the same room together--hubby watching movies and me reading--so we tend to only heat the one room we are in with a small space heater.Hubby and I each have cheap, prepaid cell plans ($30 each per month through Walmart's TMobile plan).We have nice cell phones (Samsung Galaxy S2 smart phones) which we paid cash for and will probably use for three or four years.We don't have the latest tech.  We each have laptops which are two or more years old and it took me until just recently to get a tablet (which was deeply discounted).  Our things work well and we don't feel like we need to have the newest and greatest tech items.We shop at the Goodwill for most of our home decor and all of our clothes (I haven't been to a mall in ages).We need less clothing and can get by fine with basic clothing since we don't work (no business wardrobe any more hooray!).Less clothing also means we do less laundry (we can wear our clothes a couple of days in a row since we go to different places so people don't see us with the same clothes on; this saves the need to wash two or three sets of clothing a day).Speaking of laundry, I cut dryer sheets in half which gives us twice as many dryer sheets.  I know this is a tiny savings but it is a savings.I've also got in the habit of using less soap.  Less laundry soap, less shampoo, less hair conditioner, less toothpaste, less dish soap.  The job still gets done but we aren't wasteful with these items.I can also stretch items such as make up since if I don't go out for the day I don't put on make up--the more often I do this the longer my make up lasts.  Ditto for nail polish, perfume, etc.We reuse items when possible.  Old towels go into the rag bag to clean the floors, old sponges and toothbrushes are used for yucky cleaning jobs, etc.The home products we buy are also cheaper now.  Instead of fancy Bath and Body Works soap, we use cute hand soaps bought at the $1 store which does the same thing (cleans your hands) for much cheaper.We also shop with a shopping list instead of buying whatever catches our eye which saves a lot of money.We re-purpose items when possible (thus the reason our old counter top oven is sitting outside on an old file cabinet--we use the old oven because it still basically works so roasting can be done outside instead of inside and buying a \"real\" stand for it would have been expensive so we picked up an old metal two-drawer filing cabinet for $5 at the Goodwill which works great as a stand--and even has drawers to keep supplies in!)We use coupons when shopping (but only for items we were planning on buying anyway) and generally only buy loss leaders or items that are on sale.Most of our food is bought at the 99 cent store, the $1 store, and the Asian/Mexican grocery stores.Almost all of our meals are made at home, from scratch.Almost all of our goodies/deserts/etc are made at home from scratch as well.We do eat out but almost always on hubby's comps.  We rarely eat at restaurants unless it is a gift or it is on the dollar menu of the local fast food place.Hubby uses his monthly \"allowance\" to play poker (one of his hobbies) but fortunately he usually wins and double fortunately he earns \"comps\" from his play which gives us free restaurant meals.Hubby also plays poker online which is both free and he can win things such as restaurant gift certificates, hotel stays, etc.Generally our hobbies are inexpensive--walking and genealogy for me, bowling and poker for hubby.We also take advantage of the myriad free community events to keep us entertained (free guided hikes in the local National Park, ShowTickets4Locals for free show tickets, etc).We don't travel as often as we used to which saves A LOT of money (fortunately we live in a tourist area and everyone comes to visit us!).When we do travel we tend to do so as cheaply as possible (using air miles, riding Megabus, staying with friends instead of at a hotel, etc).We also travel during the off-season which saves a lot of money and hassle.We use cash only.  We made a foray into credit card use but found that we tend to spend more when using credit cards.  Now we only use credit cards for big purchases (to get cash back) and pay the card off as soon as we get the bill.We sell things we no longer need on Craigslist both as a way to get rid of clutter and to bring in a bit of extra money.Stuff I don't want to get rid of goes to hubby or the kids (hubby has my hand-me-down computer, the kids and grand kids get care packages with clothes, purses, and other items we no longer need).Note that if we are mailing gifts we pay attention to shipping costs and try to use flat rate boxes whenever possible.  If I'm sending gifts to Japan I try to choose the smallest and lightest gifts possible to save mailing costs.I make a bit of extra money with advertising on my blogs (Adsense) and through royalties on a book I wrote a couple years ago.Occasionally we have found things, either stuff sitting at the curb on trash day or tossed to the side of the road, cleaned up the items, then sold them on Craigslist.All of our bank accounts are free (through credit unions that we have used for years and through a local bank where we have our mortgage).We pay all of our bills online which saves the cost of checks and stamps.We pull our free credit reports once a year just to make sure the information is correct (if we ever did need credit this would be a good pre-emptive way to ensure our credit info is correct and up to date).We are pretty much minimalists and don't buy a whole lot of stuff other than necessities (ie: I have five items of makeup, my sister, when she comes to visit, brings more than 50 items just for her face!).When we do need to buy things I always compare prices at regular stores and online in order to get the best deal.When I buy things online, if there is a line for a promo code or coupon, I quickly Google for this in order to save even more money.We take advantage of scratch and dent sales on big items (ie: our new refrigerator was $400 off because it had a small dent and a couple of scratches).Occasionally we have had household items that have broken or stopped working.  I simply Google the problem and usually find a cheap and easy way to fix it.We do all of our own home repairs (hubby recently replaced our kitchen faucet), yard work (we keep all of our trees and shrubs clipped and tidy), and house cleaning (easy with a small house).We take advantage of hubby's age and ask for senior discounts for everything (this gets us half off at the Goodwill on Wednesday's, nearly free car registration because of a senior tax rebate program in our county, etc).I also ask for veteran's discounts since hubby is a vet, military discounts, a locals discount (common in Las Vegas), and any other kind of discount I can think of just to get a lower price.I use only free apps and free software (years ago, software would cost me $500 for some programs!).I also use free online services to save and make money (Skype, PayPal, etc).We pay our bills on time (to avoid late fees) and in full (some bills can be paid annually or bi-annually in order to save a monthly payment fee).We tithe each month (which doesn't save money but seems to be a good thing anyway).We also happily spend money on giving to various charities and good causes (we like to support a school in the Philippines by finding inexpensive used books and discounted school supplies here to send there).We like to help out friends and neighbors whenever possible (not a money saver really, but good karma).When we do have parties or a lot of people to feed we tend to make grand meals and desserts at home instead of taking everyone out to dinner or buying store bought items.We don't have bad habits (we don't drink, smoke, or do drugs which saves A LOT of money...and drama).We also don't do drama (we don't bail people out of jail, break leases, have to take out payday loans to pay our bills, have legal problems, etc.  This also saves a lot of money).We diligently look at each purchase and see if it is really necessary, if we can buy it cheaper somewhere else, if there is another item that would work in its place, etc.We don't pay \"stupid taxes\" any more these days (this ranges from late payment fees to buying a boat or RV that we would rarely use).We don't buy things even though \"everyone else\" is buying it (example: time shares when they were popular, Keureg coffee makers that EVERYONE has but which we find to be too expensive, etc).We do pay more for good quality items, but we still try to get the best price for the item (ie: I recently bought expensive Brooks and Teva shoes for super low prices at Ross and TJ Maxx; I don't mind spending on these items because I know they will last a long time).We get our hair cut every other month at a cheap chain salon, plus hubby cuts my hair in between professional cuts which means I don't need my hair cut as frequently.  We also do our own at-home hair color.We don't buy each other gifts.  We used to buy extravagant gifts for each other but now we are happy with simple, hand made cards for each holiday (mostly because we don't need stuff, we don't need to impress each other, and we don't need the bills that come along with such grand gestures).We don't pay for a gym membership.  We make it a point to walk in our neighborhood every day, we bought a $50 treadmill on Craigslist for days when we don't walk outside, hubby bowls, and we both do free hikes which are great ways to exercise for free.We have an apricot tree in our yard which gives us free fruit, rose bushes which give us free flowers, and I just started a simple garden to provide low-cost tomatoes, chard, and green onions which we use often.We have no-spend days where we stay home and don't spend any money.On days that we are gone all day, I try to remember to pack us a lunch which saves us from stopping by fast food places.By staying home a couple times a week and otherwise being conservative in where we go, we save a lot of money on gas for our car.We re-gift.  Shhh don't tell anyone.  But we have a box full of new items that people give us that we can't use so we tend to re-gift them to others whom we know will appreciate them.We don't really give gifts much any more.  We tend to send money to the kids and grand kids so they can buy what they really want, we often cook and bake for friends and neighbors because we feel like these things are more useful/appreciated, and we try to be as helpful as possible all the time (not just holidays) when someone needs help (whether it is fixing their sink or giving them a ride to the airport).I read everything that comes in the mail.  I've found everything from free radon tests from the county to flyers in our utility bills for a list of utility rebates simply by reading what is sent to us.We get all of our media online for free these days.  We no longer have magazine or newspaper subscriptions.I also find out a lot of useful information online these days (from reddit, fellow bloggers, etc).We try to not waste food by using up everything (old apples become applesauce, old bananas become banana bread, old bread becomes bread pudding, etc).  We like eating leftovers.I like to experiment with making food items I would otherwise buy: yogurt, pizza, milkshakes, etc.PBS is about the best station on TV.  I like learning (lots of this on PBS) and I have learned quite a few things by watching this station in the evenings (how to do home repairs, how to make new recipes, etc).We like to look for hidden gems: a local mall has the best (free) kids play place so we always take our nieces there, our local university has wonderful (free) lectures that are open to the public, and our military hospital has the best (and cheapest) meals in its cafeteria that we have found anywhere. Occasionally we give bartering a try.  When we were traveling we bartered room and board for babysitting, we trade a free catered meal to the shop that changes our oil for free, hubby has traded bowling items he no longer needs for items he wants.There are other things we have considered but haven't yet tried (renting an extra room on Air BnB, going totally car-less, trading our house for someone else's in a vacation spot, etc).Each year we go through our list of bills and see if #1 we still need the bill (we dropped down to liability when we realized we didn't really need full coverage insurance on an old car) and #2 if we can call and get a better rate (like on our insurance or on our internet).When we find amazing things we take advantage of them and let others know about them as well (like a forever senior pass for national parks for only $10, or the free and amazing genealogy library in our city).We tend to rent or borrow bigger items that we don't need much (ie: we used to own a full sized refrigerator dolly, we would borrow or rent this sort of item now.  Ditto for special tools, etc).We have also found that it makes sense to rent a car when necessary.  Our car is great for around town but maybe not so great for a long road trip in which case we would rent a care instead of thinking we need to buy a new more dependable car).When I need inspiration I generally find it online (basically I listen to Dave Ramsey until I get myself back on track).We don't shop for entertainment.  We used to, but this makes us spend a lot more money than when we look at shopping like a strategic business move.Overall we are very satisfied and happy with our lives.  While some of these things might seem like a lot of work (or just plain odd) they actually become habitual, easy ways to save money over the long run."},

{"title": "10 Things Thursday", "date": "Thursday, February 6, 2014", "text": "This week has flown by!  Here's 10 random musings...I am SO GLAD we don't live in the Northeast.  We have a lot of family who live in Connecticut and they have been pounded with snow and bad weather for more than two months.  eekkkIt was hubby's birthday a couple of days ago.  He is now 65 years old and on Medicare!  The cousins took us out to a nice dinner for his birthday and while discussing Medicare (a popular topic among seniors) I discovered that the amount of Medicare taken out of your Social Security varies, I guess, by income, as hubby will now have $104 taken out of his Social Security check each month to cover Medicare while his cousin has $340 taken out of her Social Security check each month for Medicare.I did our taxes yesterday (online at H & R Block) and it was so quick and easy.  I used to get the forms and figure our taxes manually but since I started doing my taxes online it is so much easier and, with a discount because I filed with them last year, I only paid $19.95!After doing our taxes I told hubby \"do you realize we live on $24,000 a year?\" and he said \"no way\" so I checked and checked again and indeed we made a grand total of $24,000 last year and for some unknown reason we were able to live very comfortably on that small amount (contrary to years ago when we were making close to six figures and were always broke and never had any money).And then I ran across this article which shows how other early retirees live well on very low incomes as well.  (Hint: minimalism and frugality are the key!).I am still walking every day and have 890 miles to go to reach my goal of walking 1000 miles.We went shopping at the commissary a few days ago and I was so disappointed!  It used to be that the military commissary (grocery store) prices were much much lower than food prices you would find at regular grocery stores but when we went this time, I found that nearly all of the items we usually buy could be found cheaper at the 99 cent store or at regular grocery stores when the items are on sale. I got hubby a bowling ball spinner for his birthday.  It basically spins the bowling ball around at a high rate of speed while you use sandpaper and/or cleaner to make the surface of the ball like new.  The machine cost $250 but I figure it will pay for itself eventually because each time he has this done at the bowling alley it costs $5 (and he does this once or twice a week).The Seahawks won the Super Bowl!  I was so excited as they are my home town team.  I was even going to bet a few dollars on them winning but the lines at the sports books were so long I didn't (I wish I would have!).I'm going to grow my own chard.  I buy Swiss chard at the grocery store a couple of times a week (I need my greens on a regular basis) but the prices have been going up and the quality has been going down so this week when we go to Walmart I am going to buy some chard seeds and some soil and grow my own.  If this works, I will try a few other things like tomatoes and green onions!"},
{"title": "In Which the Washer and Dryer Get Returned Before They Are Even Delivered", "date": "Sunday, February 2, 2014", "text": "Last week when I bought a refrigerator it was kind of by accident.  I have \"buy new refrigerator\" as one of my annual goals and I happened to be at Best Buy and saw a great sale on a scratch and dent refrigerator. The scratches were barely noticeable, the small dent was in the back where it couldn't be seen, the price was excellent, and it was a Whirlpool which is a good brand so I bought it immediately.  I then went home and read the reviews about the refrigerator and it got 4.5 stars out of 5 by more than 30 reviewers so I was happy with my purchases (and FWIW, the reviewers were correct when they said the ice maker was loud and sometimes the ice gets stuck in the chute but we can live with that.  In other words, I take what reviewers say to heart because they are generally right on about the item they are reviewing--barring the few reviews where it sounds like the reviewer was paid to write a great review or the rare reviewer who happens to get stuck with a lemon when generally the product is very good).Fast forward to last night.  I forgot to check the reviews for the washer and dryer set that we had bought and which was scheduled to be delivered on Tuesday so I hopped online and found these reviews and was pretty disappointed.  I mean this is a Maytag which is supposed to be a good brand and there was the lonely Maytag repairman all those years ago! The reason I chose this set was that the price was good and the washer was a top loader (I loathe the new and popular front loaders as you practically need to stand on your head to get the clothes out of them or you can pay $400 extra for empty metal boxes that raise the machines up, neither choice I like).  My grandmother had Maytags, my mother had Maytags, and I had Maytags and they used to last forever.  Plus I've had a number of friends spend a lot of money on expensive front loading machines and then need to make service call after service call because they have problems with them.What I want in a washing machine is a good, solid, basic machine that washes my clothes and will last for decades (like appliances used to, apparently this isn't often the case these days).  The set we have now was bought used and while they work well, there is too much vibration in the washer--it doesn't hop across the floor but it does shake a lot.  So after much research last night, I cancelled my order for the washer and dryer and got a refund and how have my heart set on this washer and dryer set.  Since this set will cost nearly a thousand dollars more than the set we had purchased, I have decided to wait a couple of months to save up a bit more money before we buy them."},
{"title": "10 Things for Today", "date": "Saturday, February 1, 2014", "text": "Here's 10 random musings for today:I did a volksmarch today; 7 miles and I felt like I could keep walking and walking.It's Chinese New Year--the year of the horse--and I got some great photos of how Las Vegas is celebrating the holiday (see photo above and my other blog in the sidebar).Tomorrow is the Super Bowl--go Seahawks! I'm worried about the drought.  We have had very little rain and our neighbor, California, is doing some pretty extreme water rationing (this could really impact the cost of produce in the future).My skin is so dry it feels like paper--this cold, dry weather is not good for my skin!No wheat today.  I believe that wheat has a negative impact on my body but it is so hard to avoid (plus I love bread...and pasta...and donuts...and...).  But I just found this blog and was reinspired to cut wheat out of my diet for a while and see if it makes a difference in my health.I'm watching Judge Judy.  I love Judge Judy.  I find that personal responsibility and logical thinking is sadly lacking in many aspects of our lives (the news, social media, etc) so her show is quite refreshing.I applied to work at the WSOP online last night.  It is one of my goals for this year and it was a lot of fun last year (after the steep learning curve) plus a good way to make a clump of extra money.I can't wait to do our taxes but I am still waiting for one W2 to get here.  I hope it comes soon so I can get our taxes all done and over (and our refund into our account!).I made an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of our spending and my walking mileage for the month; I will report the totals here at the end of the month."},
{"title": "A Wrap-Up for This Month's Goals", "date": "Friday, January 31, 2014", "text": "Whew!  It's been a heck of a month!  Here's some updates for this month:Daily updateWalk: 2 miles (909 miles to go).  No spend: We spent $5.84.  We were driving by a taco truck that we pass all the time and always wondered about because there are always so many people stopping to eat there and hubby stopped and got me two tacos for a total of $2.50 (and they were yummy!).  I also got a Blast for $3.34 (ugh...bad bad habit).Update this blog: yepUpdate client's blog: yep. Photo: yepGenealogy: added info for a couple of peopleWriting: a couple of paragraphsAnd here are our grand totals for the month:Walking:  I walked a total of 91 miles this month and walked 29 out of 31 days (I missed one due to laziness and one due to wind).  I would like to walk about 100 miles per month, with a minimum of 83 miles per month in order to reach my goal of walking 1000 miles this year.  Even walking only two miles per day will give me 60-62 miles in a month then adding a few volksmarches will jack that total up closer to 100 miles.  Overall I'm really happy with my walking this month!Spending:  We had 7 no spend days this month.  We spent $212.14 on food and household items, $43 on tips, $65 on unexpected bowling expenses (a fundraiser and an annual fee; monthly bowling league costs are part of our regular budget); $77 on eating out (tips were tallied separately); $20.11 on Baskin Robbins Blasts (a total of seven Blasts, one was free); $91.40 on gas; $78.05 on shopping for clothes, a bag, etc (Goodwill, Ross, etc); and $2,601.24 on appliances and tech products.Overall we spent like maniacs this month but the giant total for appliances and tech stuff were mostly once in a decade or more expenses (and some of these purchases were for a couple of my annual goals).  Even though $20 for Baskin Robbins isn't much, it would be better for my health if I could totally quit this bad habit.  We spent more than I had thought on tips and eating out which could--probably should--be curtailed a bit (but this would probably increase the amount we spend on groceries).  Gas for the car was about average, and other shopping was a bit more splurge-y than most other months.So my goals for February are:Do 12 volksmarchesWalk 2 miles for the other 16 days of the month (for a total of 28 days of walking)Do our taxesApply to work WSOPDo a no spend month (and really really cut our spending this month!)No Baskin Robbins Blasts for the monthWork 60 hours for my clientStock our house prior to all of our guests arrivingWrite and publish a bookPay off my credit card that I used for the appliances (I will use my January paycheck for this, my February paycheck, and sell our old appliances to accomplish this)Don't worry, I won't bore you with the daily details like I did this month but I will keep these goals listed on a spreadsheet so I can do an end of the month wrap up."},
{"title": "OK Now I am REALLY Done Shopping", "date": "Thursday, January 30, 2014", "text": "Today we had nothing to do.  Hubby is finished with poker for a while (some guy won the $120k jackpot late last night so now all of the tired poker players can go home and recuperate from playing so much) so I said \"let's go pick up a kitchen faucet at Home Depot.\"  $1,175.18 later we are finished with everything on my shopping list...  (As you can guess, no spend month starts on Saturday).  So here is the whole shopping saga:Last week we bought a new refrigerator.  It cost $1099 but since it had a small dent and a few scratches because it was a floor model, we got it for $699.96 ($759.68 with tax).  This price included free delivery and set up.That same day I also picked up two 32\" TVs for our guest rooms and, since we don't have cable TV, we also bought digital antennas for the TVs.  The total costs for these were $432.38--$199 each on sale--plus $20 for each antenna).  Today we set them up and I think our guests will be happy with them.Then today we got the kitchen sink faucet we originally went to buy which was $64.00 however the guy said if hubby applied for a Home Depot credit card he would get $50 off the purchase so the faucet actually cost $14!  I asked him if he would give me $50 off a purchase too if I applied for a credit card and he said yes so I applied and bought a $119 garage door opener for $69.  Note that as soon as we get the credit cards we will probably cancel them because we certainly don't need any more credit cards but this was a great deal and saved us $100 on our purchases.This is the old, cheap faucet (you really do get what you pay for):And this is the new faucet (love it!):And then, as we were leaving the store, we saw a sign for 10% additional off all appliances so we ran back to the appliance section and ended up buying a new washer and dryer!  The set will be delivered and set up on Tuesday so no picture yet.  The set was originally $1,299.98 but they were on sale for $1,087.93 then we got another 10% ($100) off for plus free delivery and hook up.  We did need to buy new hoses and vent material so the total cost was $1,060.92 which is less that I had planned on paying for a new washer and dryer.  Overall I am really happy with the prices we got on all of the items we bought.  I told hubby I was done shopping and he said \"Thank God\" then I told him I wanted new flooring in the whole house but would wait until next year to which he said \"Thank God\" again.Daily updateWalk: 0 miles (911 miles to go).  It was so incredibly windy today that I didn't want to walk.  When it is windy in Las Vegas it is brown and hazy outside because there is so much sand and dust in the air--it burns your eyes and makes you cough and it's just yuck.No spend: We spent $1,175.18 today.  $74.57 at Home Depot for a garage door opener.  $1060.92 at Home Depot for a washer and dryer.  $34.52 at Home Depot for a kitchen faucet, plumbers tape and acetone.  $5.17 at Burger King for lunch.Update this blog: yepUpdate client's blog: yep.  My client doesn't care how much I update his blog as long as there are a couple of posts a week.  This month I decided to post six days a week but it didn't do much to increase traffic so next month I will go back to two or three posts a week.Photo: yepGenealogy: about a half hour of research.Writing: a couple of paragraphs"},

{"title": "I Want to Be a Wealthy Old Person", "date": "Tuesday, January 21, 2014", "text": "Hubby's friends bought some tickets to a show today then couldn't go so they gave them to us.  It sounded like fun and we were happy to go plus it was going to be held at Sun City Anthem which I had heard a lot about but never visited before.  A friend had told me a long time ago that Sun City is where rich old people go to retire and, after seeing the place today, I would have to agree.  I would also have to agree that when it comes to retiring, it is better to retire rich than poor.Early this morning, before the show, I knew I wouldn't have time to walk in the afternoon so I went to the Las Vegas Strip and did a nine mile walk (yep, nine miles!).  Sadly, there are A LOT of panhandlers on the Strip, even worse is that a lot of these people, many homeless, others probably barely getting by on Social Security, are elderly.  There is a world of difference between the poor elderly in our city and the well to do elderly at Sun City.The folks at Sun City were well dressed, have fancy cars (I was walking through the parking lot and in one row there was a BMW, Lexus, Lexus, Land Rover, Mercedes, BMW, BWM, etc), they have their hair done, have good looking teeth, appear to be in good health, talk about their latest vacations, and 300 of them today paid $50 per person for this show (which was actually very good and was a fundraiser for the Philippines typhoon victims).  The little city itself is full of beautiful houses that start at a half million dollars and go up from there, plus there is a gorgeous golf course and lots of lots of water features.The poor elderly that you will see on the Strip have poor dental care, they are dirty and unkempt, they are outside in the freezing cold and the roasting summer heat, and spending $50 on a whim is out of the question.Granted there are lots of retirees in between--not destitute poor and not fabulously rich--which we currently are.  We get by fine but we don't have a lot of extra money and certainly never spend frivolously and while we are quite happy, I feel like we need a better plan to provide more money for us in our later years.  What I would/should spend more time focusing on is:Investing.  We have no investments and I don't understand much about investing but with information and the means to invest (e Trade, etc) so easily accessible, I really should put some effort into doing this.Pension.  Hubby has a pension but I do not.  Fewer and fewer jobs offer cushy pensions (or any pension at all) and even if I started now with a job with a good pension plan, I would be working until I was 80 to get it fully funded.Social Security.  Hubby gets Social Security but I am nearly 20 years off from collecting mine (if the fund will even be there in twenty years is iffy at best).Other retirement accounts.  Neither of us have IRAs, 401k's, or other kinds of retirement accounts (which, if I was paying the least amount of attention decades ago, I should have started...I didn't think I would get old this fast!).Savings.  We have some money in savings but the paltry interest on these accounts certainly isn't anything to rave about.Passive income (besides investing).  I NEED to get busy writing books.  I am still getting royalties from a book I wrote a couple years ago and if I had dozens of books in print, royalties would be a nice source of monthly passive income.Rental property.  We owned rental houses before and (IMHO) it was a giant pain.  If I was good at property management this would probably be a viable source of income for us but I'm not.What we do have is a house that will probably be paid off in record time, very few needs, and the ability to live frugally.  However I am going to make an effort to do other things that will have the possibility of increasing our assets/income in the future.  We may not end up in Sun City, but I want us both to live comfortably (with lots more splurge money) in our later years.Daily updateWalk: 9 miles (929 miles to go!)No spend: $0.  Finally--another no spend day.  Everything was free for us at the show including a lite lunch afterwards.Update this blog: yepUpdate client's blog: yepPhoto: yepGenealogy: another day, another family sheet.  While it is impossible to fill out these sheets completely, at least getting a few people accounted for each time I work on this is a good thing.Writing: about a half hour (obviously I need to start putting more effort into this!)"},

{"title": "5 Home Improvement Items I Want for Our House", "date": "Saturday, January 18, 2014", "text": "I seem to be on a home improvement kick lately.  In fact, I spent over an hour today browsing through home depot while visions of home improvement tasks danced in my head.  Here's my short list of home improvement tasks I want to accomplish this year:I would absolutely love to have a tankless water heater.  These are supposed to save a lot of money over the cost of your standard hot water tank that keeps gallons and gallons of water hot 24/7.  Plus, our gas utility will give us a $350 rebate if we buy such a hot water heater.  I'm hoping I can squeeze some money out of my summer work to buy one of these.A new washer and dryer.  This purchase is one of my goals for the year.  Our current set was bought super cheap from a cousin when we bought our house in Las Vegas and while the set is OK it isn't great and I don't think is is very water/gas/power saving.  I want to get a high efficiency washer and dryer set but it doesn't need to be a super fancy $1500 per unit kind of set, something basic will do fine.  I also think we can get some sort of utility rebate when we buy these items plus my BIL works at Sears and can get us even more discounts on appliances. We need an electric garage door opener.  Our house didn't come with one so we need to open the door manual and while this isn't a big problem because we don't park in the garage it would be nice to have.  I checked the price at Home Depot today but I think I can get a new unit for about half the price on Amazon.A new refrigerator is also on our goal list for this year.  Again, we bought a super cheap refrigerator, along with the washer and dryer, from the cousin when we moved into our house.  It is basic and nothing fancy and not even a side-by-side model.  So I definitely want to get a new side-by-side refrigerator with a water filtration system (our tap water is just horrible in Las Vegas).New flooring, while not necessary, is something I definitely want to get.  Our house had brand new carpet when we moved in but it was cheap and it was carpet.  In colder climates I love wall to wall carpet but in the hot, sandy, desert, I would like a laminate wood floor or tile for our house.  As it is, there is so much dust in the air that it settles in the carpet and makes it kind of yucky even if I vacuum a couple times a week.  Also, tile seems to keep the house cooler which is a plus in Las Vegas.  So we hope to get new flooring which will probably end up being a combination of wood floor/tile and carpet (apparently putting wood floor or tile on the stairs is super expensive so many people put carpet on the stairs).Daily updateWalk: 2 miles.  Hubby is doing marathon poker this weekend so I ran over to the park and did my two mile walk (dodging soccer balls as there are four soccer fields inside of the walking path.  Eeekkk). Only 942 more miles to go!No spend: $7.32.  We had lunch at the casino which was free with hubby's comps but we did leave a $4 tip.  I almost forget, I got a Baskin Robbins Blast today as well.Update this blog: yepUpdate client blog: yepPhoto: yepGenealogy: Another half hour of FamilySearch.  I simply click on a family file and try to fill in more and more blanks.  Writing: I was very productive on my trusty talbet as hubby played poker.  Yeah productivity!"},

{"title": "10 Things About Walking", "date": "Thursday, January 16, 2014", "text": "I can't believe I have walked every day for 16 days so far.  Hopefully I will walk every day for the rest of the year and beyond!  But I am taking it one step at a time and walking a bit everyday to chip away at my goal to walk 1000 miles this year (and also to practice for the marathon I want to walk and the one-day 25 mile hike from rim to rim at the Grand Canyon which is also on my goal list).  Here's 10 things I've learned about walking so far:The right shoes are worth their weight in gold.  Regular running shoes kill my feet after a couple of hours of walking in stiffer walking-specific shoes make my feet feel wonderful even after many many miles.I've always walked with a regular day pack but last month I spend a bunch of money to get a really good day pack and it has made a huge difference!  This one is super comfortable, has a wonderful belt that makes the thing practically immobile when it is on me, has useful pockets on the hip belt, and overall carries the load really well no matter how much weight I am hauling.Walking is a great exercise to keep in shape.  It is free--just walk out your door, can be done anywhere, can be done with a group or by yourself, and after a couple weeks of walking your whole body will feel better.When you feel a hot spot on your foot, stop immediately and take care of it.  I've put these things off a couple of times when I have done long distance walks and always regretted it--it can go from a hot spot to a huge blister in the matter of a mile or two.Always carry with you: water, sunscreen, sunglasses, a sweater, tissue, a snack, cash, a cell phone, a tiny first aid kit, and an umbrella if you are walking in a rainy area.Once you start walking a lot you will realize how important the food you fuel your body with is.  Sugary carby breakfast cereal just won't give you the energy to walk very far compared to a high protein meal to start your day.That being said, some carby sugary candy is a great way to keep yourself going once you start walking.  I always carry chocolate with me when I walk.Your health will improve.  People who walk everyday, especially those who walk long distances will not only lose weight and build muscle as well as increase stamina, they will probably find that medical problems such as high cholesterol, diabetes, and high blood pressure are much more manageable.Be safe when you walk.  You might want to carry pepper spray, you definitely want to carry a cell phone, you will want to pick the places you walk with a concern towards your safety, and you definitely want to use crosswalks/crossing lights to get across busy roads.Starting a walking program is hard--it is much easier to stay on the couch and be lazy or use the excuses of everyday life to keep you at home instead of on your feet and walking but committing to walk even a mile or so a day is something that everyone can do (and once you are used to walking, your speed and stamina will increase and that mile will only take you 10 to 15 minutes to complete!). Daily UpdateWalk: 2 miles (only 946 more miles to go!)No spend: $2 (hubby had a hot dog at the casino for lunch--I need to remember to send a sandwich with him!)Update this blog: yepUpdate client blog: yepPhoto: yepClient work: 1 hour (for a different client working on her website)Genealogy: a little, I'm making a list of documents I need to get at the genealogy library which provides free access to documents only available on paid sites)Writing: yes, also a little.  I need to reorganize the entire document then make a list of parts to write in order to fill in gaps"},

{"title": "Clever Hubby Trick: Bowling Tip", "date": "Tuesday, January 14, 2014", "text": "Hubby started bowling again a couple months ago after taking twelve years off from the sport.  His fingers look a bit chewed up since he is now bowling four or five days a week and doesn't have the callouses he once did from bowling every day. The pro shop sells a \"skin patch\" kit for $3 which is basically a super glue like substance and some tiny gauze pieces which you use to patch up broken skin.  It works really well and keeps the skin from getting more tore up but for what you get, the price is pretty high (there are about 15 tiny gauze pieces and a tiny bit of glue).  So hubby decided to experiment and make his own.  He bought clear nail polish from the $1 store and a box of gauze pads for $1 which he cut up into tiny pieces (he only used one of the five gauze pads and this gave him more than 50 pieces!).  He tried this new patch out the last time he bowled and reported that it worked better than the stuff actually made for patching the skin.  So for a total of $2 he now has enough skin patch stuff to last for the rest of the bowling season (see photo above; the commercial product is on the bottom and the product he made is on top).Daily update:Walk: 6 miles (I did another volksmarch while hubby played poker. 954 miles to go)No spend: We spent $56.79 ($45.45 on gas; $3.34 on a Baskin Robbins Blast; $3 tip for breakfast--the meal was free with hubby's comps; $2 tip for coffee in the poker room; $3 tip for dinner--the meal was free with hubby's comps)Update this blog: yepUpdate client's blog: yepPhoto: yepClient work: 1 hourGenealogy: a bit using Family Search to find info on some distant ancestorsWriting: three pages written on my tablet while hubby played pokerThis post is for yesterday since we are \"on vacation\" (actually right down the street from our house in a hotel) for a couple of days and I was #1 too cheap to pay for in room wi-fi and #2 too lazy to haul myself and my laptop down to Starbucks to use their free wi fi last night.Yesterday's updateWalk: 7 miles (I did a volksmarch.  The weather has been just perfect for walking this month! 960 miles to go)No spend: We spent a total of $14.95 ($2.08 at the 99 Cent store for candy and acetone nail polish remover which hubby uses to clean his bowling balls; $1 for popcorn which hubby bought me at the bowling alley because he said it looked good; $1 tip for the free shuttle driver--I use the shuttle to go from the hotel to the Strip instead of driving; $5.46 for Subway since hubby was hungry while playing poker; $1 hubby tipped the waitress for coffee while he was playing poker; $4.41 for a late night snack from Wendys since we skipped dinner--a late lunch was free from hubby's cousin...dim sum...yum!)Update this blog: yep, lateUpdate client's blog: nope, no internet accessPhoto: yep via Instagram and my cell phone which makes it really easy to snap and post a picture every dayClient work: nope, no internet accessGenealogy: nope, no internet accessWriting: yep on my trusty tablet"},

{"title": "5 Things About Technology", "date": "Monday, January 6, 2014", "text": "It's been a busy tech week around here...I was reading somewhere that you could update your phone online so I thought I would give it a try.  I Googled \"how to update Samsung Galaxy S2\" and it took me right to the page where I could update my phone for free through Samsung (the software downloads through my computer right to my cell phone which is connected via USB).  I did both hubby's and my phones since they are exactly the same and now my phone works better and with the new software even looks like a new phone!As you could see from my post yesterday, I ended up buying another tablet.  When I returned the previous tablet I saw that Best Buy was selling the Samaung Galaxy Tab 3 7\" tablets for $139.  This is a HUGE saving over it's usual price ($199) and also much cheaper than the other tablets I was looking at (Surface, Samsung 10\" tablets, etc).  I am SOOO  happy with it!  I made it my \"work\" tablet so no social media/games/etc on it.  I did download a free Office suite (Kingsoft Office; it allows you to create MS Office compatible documents/Excel/PPT) and a free swype-type keyboard (Touch PalX).  I wrote an entire chapter of my book on it while hubby was bowling today!  At first I thought it would be too small since it is only a couple inches bigger than my cell phone and a 10\" tablet seems more work-like but it is perfect.  I hold it in one hand and can swype type with ease.  Also reading Kindle books on it is great too!One thing about buying tech, when you buy one tech item, that purchase often needs additional purchases to make it \"complete\".  Case in point, hubby bought a soundbar for our TV at the end of last month then when we went to set it up a couple days ago, it needed a special cord to connect it (thus the purchase a couple days ago).  And for my new tablet, since I am sure I am going to keep it and it is a bit fragile, I had to order a cover for it.  The covers are incredibly cheap from Amazon but still, it was an added expense during our no spend month.  I will wait until later to get a memory card for the table as I really don't need one now.As you can tell from the photo, hubby got busy again and made me a padded pocket for the table so I can slip it into my purse without the tablet getting scratched or squished.  Again, reusing a padded mailing envelope that would otherwise have been thrown away.  This definitely saved me a few dollars and gave me piece of mind that the tablet will be protected.Finally, I have been saving a lot of money online lately.  When I get my Baskin Robbins Blast I get the receipt with the drink then by filling out a survey online, I get $1 off my next purchase (perpetually it seems like).  Then I commented on one of my favorite romance writer's blog and she sent me a $10 Amazon gift card!  This went to pay for most of the tablet cover above as I didn't realize that I had to pay for shipping from Amazon (before Christmas Amazon was shipping all items for free).  It still saved me $10 which was great!  Plus I have two more surveys waiting to be done, one for $10 off at Office Depot and one for Albertsons.  I guess taking a couple of minutes to fill out surveys online really pays off!Daily update:Walk:  2 miles (984 more miles to go.  The weather has been perfect and hubby has been walking with me everyday).No spend:  Total: $18.06.  $8.01 (Amazon, tablet cover and shipping), $10.05 (Albertsons; 1 lb cheese, 2 dozen eggs, bunch of kale, 4 cinnamon rolls)Update this blog: yepUpdate client's blog: yepPhoto: yepClient work: 3 hours today (yeah!)Genealogy:  yep (I've got a long list of documents to order, unfortunately all will cost money)Non fiction book:  one sectionFiction book: a whole chapter done on my new tablet!"},

Yeah!).The one and only book I wrote a couple of years ago is still selling and each month I get a bit of money into my bank account from it which is nice.  I was working on another book last year and kind of left it by the wayside.  Part of the reason for this is that I got discouraged when I read a couple of negative reviews about my current book (here) and part of the reason was probably sheer laziness.But two things made me hop back on the writing bandwagon.  First, was the idea that if I write even a little every day, the book will eventually get done (as opposed to working on the book for hours then not touching it again for weeks or even months--it will never get done that way!).  And the second, was reading the bad reviews.  Fortunately (thanks to Reddit), I've developed a tough skin, also, I think the comments can be used constructively.So I have decided to do a second edition of the Washington book.  I will shrink up the spacing between the items (this will make the book more listy and shorter and cheaper to buy) as well as add more information about each item (as one of the reviews suggested).  It is also a good idea to have an editor, or at least a second set of eyes on it to point out things that I missed or things that could be done better, so I will have someone--or a bunch of someones--read the proof edition before I get it published.

EeekkkkSpeaking of eating, I baked a couple of pumpkin pies today just because I want pumpkin pie and the Thanksgiving-Christmas holidays seem to be the only time I make such pies.  I ran out of Crisco, however, and ended up using half butter and half Crisco for the pie crust.  I'm still waiting to see how this concoction comes out but I definitely think Crisco is better for pies as the butter seemed to make the crust too squishy to work with.We still have no set plan for New Year's Eve (but this is Vegas so there is no excuse NOT to do something for New Years Eve as there are so many options from going to the Strip to a Nightclub to a casino, etc).I am also ready for our no spend month to begin in January.  December has been the month of shop shop shop and now I want to save save save.2014 is going to be the year of walking for me.  Also the year that I try to do less media consumption (I really don't need to know what is going on in the world every minute of the day as it is mostly bad/violent/psychotic stuff plus I figure if an event is big enough I will probably hear of it anyway).  ditto for social media--I need to DO more stuff and less editorializing/redditing/getting my ego stroked with likes and upvotes/etc.Here is my grandmother's famous pie crust recipe: put 2 1/4 cup of flour in a big bowl.  From this flour take out 1/3 cup of the flour and put it in a small bowl.  Add 1 tsp salt to the big bowl of flour.  Add 3/4 cup Crisco to the mixed flour and salt and cut the Crisco in (kind of mash it with a fork to blend it with the flour until the stuff is crumbly).  To the small bowl of flour add four tbsp water and make a paste.  Add the paste to the flour/Crisco mix and combine (don't knead it like bread, just mix until it sticks together).  You might need to add a bit more water if the mix is too dry.  Roll out on a floured surface.  This makes two pie crusts.Merry Christmas everyone and thank you for reading my blog over the past year and adding so many positive, supportive comments :)"},

{"title": "Let's Just Say I Suck at Using Credit Wisely", "date": "Tuesday, December 17, 2013", "text": "I've had my credit cards for approximately a week and a half and already old bad habits are showing themselves.  With one credit card, I used it exactly as planned.  I bought hubby a bowling ball with it for Christmas and will pay it off at the end of the month and won't use it again.  With this credit card I will get a $100 REI gift card which is great.With the other credit card, I figured I would pay my bills with it (cell phone, Skype, etc) and pay it off at the end of the month and since this is a cash rewards credit card it would be great because I will take care of my bills, build some credit, and get a little cash back to boot.  It didn't quite work out that way. I did pay my bills with it for the month but when we were at the mall yesterday I used it to buy us lunch--two gyros for $15--because we were hungry and hubby wanted one and I wanted to treat hubby because I haven't spent freely on him in ages so I broke out the card rationalizing that it wasn't that much money and I will just pay it off at the end of the month.  The problem with this is that, had I been using cash, there is NO WAY I would have spent $15 on a quick lunch for us.  Using a credit card made it way too easy to spend frivolously.  And then hubby got his second bowling ball in the mail yesterday and it came with a $10 credit on our next order and since hubby will be doing a traveling league, I hopped online and bought him a three ball roller bag using the $10 credit--and my credit card.  I hadn't planned to buy him a bag, I was just going to buy him two bowling balls.  If I was spending cash, I would have waited to buy the bag and spread out my purchases over a few months.  Plus I've used my credit card for a couple of Baskin Robbins Blasts, a couple of purchases at the $1 store, and probably some random stuff I can't even remember.  Ugghhhh  bad bad habit!Now most of my check will go to pay the credit card bills at the end of the month and this is certainly not how I want to live--using my credit cards then having to spend my entire income at the end of the month paying for past purchases.Soooo...I will pay off both credit cards at the end of the month.I will leave both credit cards at home and put two $100 bills in my wallet to use for financial emergencies (I'm much less likely to break a $100 bill unless it is an emergency).I will only use these credit cards once every six months (and in these cases, I will have the cash in the bank--checking not savings--to pay for what I purchase, and not rely on an upcoming paycheck to pay off the credit cards).January AND February are going to be a no-spend/low-spend months since we have been spending like crazy this month and I don't foresee any reason that we must spend in the first couple of months of the year.  Also, I feel much better about myself and our finances when I am super careful with our spending instead of casually spending money because we have it (or because I have credit cards and I have money coming in at the end of the month).We will use all of the money we don't spend on random junk during these months to put towards something we really want--traveling to Europe and hopefully Asia at the end of next year."},
{"title": "A Lazy Sunday", "date": "Sunday, December 15, 2013", "text": "It has been a quiet Sunday today--we stayed home and did pretty much nothing all day.  I am, however, making good headway on my December goals.  We had a really nice dinner out with my volksmarching group last night (all free as the organization pays for dinner--yeah!) and the new website is looking less ugly and more infectious disease-y (which should be one in the same but isn't, I hope my client likes it).I love love love our local library system.  Although we haven't been to a library in ages, I simply hop online, go to the library's emedia library, and download books to read til my heart's content (BTW Grace Burrowes is my newest favorite romance author).I can't believe there are only two and a half weeks left of this year--it has gone by so quickly!"},

{"title": "10 Things Thursday", "date": "Thursday, December 12, 2013", "text": "Here's ten things that we did today:When my sister in law stayed with us this summer, she bought a swiffer for us (everyone needs a swiffer, she said) and a bunch of disposable swiffer cleaning pads.  Well the cleaning pads finally ran out last week and I don't want to buy any more so now I'm starting on the case of disposable kitchen wipes she left (apparently everyone uses disposable kitchen wipes too).  I just pull out three or four of the moist kitchen cleaning wipes and push them around the floor with the swiffer.  It seems to work! My Yahoo mail finally came back this evening (three days later) so I've spent the last couple of hours pulling out and deleting all of my contacts on Yahoo and putting them into my Gmail account then sending an email to all of my contacts now on Gmail telling them I have a new email address.  Uggg  p.s. none of the emails sent to me over the past few days made it through all of the Yahoo drama so I don't know if anything important was sent to me or not.  Oh well.I took all of my neatly wrapped packages to the post office this morning to get the gifts sent to Japan and two of them--flat calendars--were going to cost $17 each to mail!  I swear the price to mail them last year was $6 or $7 so I was totally shocked.  I decided to only send one package to my friend and her kids (at a cost of $28!!) and the two people who were going to get calendars will now get nice Christmas cards.  Shipping costs are getting ridiculous these days!!!I used my credit card for the first time today.  It was kind of fun shopping--I bought a couple of things for hubby and couple of things for me--but it certainly gave me a twinge of guilt (?) to pull out the plastic to pay for my purchases.My sister called me today and said she has pneumonia and some lung problem.  She is a total hypochondriac but she did have cancer when she was a teenager so I hope this is only a hypochondriac thing.  She asked me if I have been waking up at 3am and sure enough I have.  It seems that whenever something bad is going to happen, I wake up every morning at 3am, sometimes it only lasts a week or so and sometime it goes on for a month.  Last week I woke up at 3am every morning for a week and then it stopped.  I've done this my entire life but fortunately it doesn't happen often often (but often enough for me to worry about what it is that will happen).I made a giant pot of curry for dinner last night and I will probably eat it for dinner every night until it is gone (I have weird eating patterns).  Hubby can only stand leftovers once or twice until he doesn't want any more.  I can eat the same thing every day for a week or two and be happy about it.January is definitely going to be a no spend month!  We seem to be spending like crazy this month or maybe it just seems that way because we were so tight on our spending last month.I making a website for a friend's work project which will give me a nice chunk of change by the end of the month.  Just getting the domain name purchased and web hosting set up took them two weeks but now I get to do the rest so I hope to get it completed this weekend.We are deciding what to do for New Year's Eve.  Hubby wants to go to the Las Vegas Strip for New Years and I would prefer to stay home.  Year before last we went to the Strip (way too many people if you ask me) then last year we stayed home (my choice) so this year hubby gets to decide.  Looks like we will be in a sea of people on the Strip for New Years :IThe weather is better.  Daytime temps are back to the 60s which is wonderful!"},
{"title": "More Technical Issues...Arrgghhh", "date": "Wednesday, December 11, 2013", "text": "This is not my month for technology.  A couple weeks ago we did the multi-day internet outage thing (complete with harried phone calls to the cable company and running back and forth to the cable company office to try to resolve the problem) and now, since Sunday night, my Yahoo email has been down with no fix in sight.I'm one of many who are furious with Yahoo email which not only can't seem to fix the glitch after days, but seems to only post one update per day on what is going on  (actually the updates only say they are experiencing maintenance issues with no additional information).  I am so irked that I missed a meeting yesterday (I could see the email come in on my phone AFTER the GoToMeeting meeting happened) and then when it came to wrapping my gifts and getting them ready to ship to Japan yesterday, I had to scramble to find the addresses to ship the gifts to because the addresses were in my contacts folder in Yahoo email which I couldn't access either through my computer or through my phone (I dug through a box and found old letters from my friends in order to find their addresses).Sooo, my project for this upcoming week is to #1 move all of my email--both work and personal--to my Gmail account and #2 make triple redundant back ups of everything that I have online (back up all of my online contacts, back up all of the phone numbers that are on my cell phone, back up all of my files and photos on my computer, etc).  I want to keep both digital copies (on a flash drive) as well as hard copies of all of this information because I never know when I will need it and I also never know when the internet/my computer/internet services like Yahoo are going to bite the dust."},
{"title": "I Got a Credit Card (!!!)", "date": "Tuesday, December 10, 2013", "text": "So I had this idea last week.  I thought that it might be time to get a credit card in my name.  Hubby has a credit card in his name which he rarely ever uses (our health insurance payment is billed to his credit card and we pay it off each month, that's about all).  He also is an authorized user on his sister's credit card which for some reason shows up on his credit report even though he only uses it when she asks him to use the card to get money to give her kids (however his sister uses the card for nearly every single purchase she makes in order to get air miles and she seems to use it A LOT.  But she also pays it off each month in full so this makes hubby's credit score really high). A couple months ago I needed a credit card to bill my monthly Skype payment to (I used PayPal the first month but since I haven't used PayPal in ages there was only enough for one month's fee) so I used hubby's credit card (I didn't want to let some company access either of my bank accounts because they are covered by my savings and I didn't want some glitch or theft or something like that to drain my bank account).Then last week I figured it was high time to get a credit card.  Besides my name being on our mortgage, I have absolutely NO credit.  I haven't had a credit card for more than three years when we got gazelle intense, paid off all of our debts and credit cards, and promptly cancelled our credit cards a la Dave Ramsey.  It was a refreshing feeling to have no debt.  Plus since then I have had no income to speak off (odd jobs here and there but nothing steady) so it didn't make sense to have a credit card because I didn't want any outstanding bills that I had no way to pay.Now that I have a grip on my spending plus a relatively steady source of income plus the need for #1 some sort of credit history (I don't want to rely only on hubby's credit history) and #2 a credit card to put some revolving expenses on, I took the plunge. I had heard that it makes sense to apply for credit cards all on the same day instead of one at a time so that it won't show that multiple businesses have checked your credit so I sat down and figured I would apply for four credit cards in the hope that at least one would give me a credit card.I applied for credit card #1 through my credit union.  They even called and confirmed my info and asked why I didn't have any credit so I explained that I paid off my debts a few years ago and have used cash to pay for everything since then.  She said she would talk to the underwriter and get back to me.  She called me back and said \"sorry, you don't have enough credit...to get a credit card.\"  Uh, OK.I applied for credit card #2 because I got a flyer in the mail from REI that said if I applied for a credit card and used it within the first 60 days after I get it, I will get a free $100 REI gift card.  Wow, that sounded nice.  I applied online, made sure there was no annual fee, and it said I was approved.  But to date I haven't heard anything from them.I considered applying for credit card #3 through Capital One.  I used to have a Capital One credit card but got tired of having a massive balance hanging over my head so I sold a bunch of stuff, sold some old gold, gathered up some of my paycheck, paid it off in a lump sum, and took great pleasure in calling to cancel the account.  They were sad to see me go.  But over the last few years they continue to send me \"we want you back\" emails so I considered reapplying for a credit card through that company but noticed it had an annual fee.  I don't want to pay an annual fee so decided not to apply for that one after all.I then went on and applied for credit card #4 through my other credit union.  The application was simple, it was all done online, they didn't even call to confirm anything, there was no annual fee, and they had a super low interest rate (which I WILL NOT NEED because I WILL NOT carry a balance from month to month).  Today I got a credit card in the mail with a $5000 credit limit.  Wow, color me surprised!So now I am the happy (?!) owner of one, possibly two credit cards.  I don't plan to use them for anything except my monthly Skype payment and my annual web hosting payments.  I intend to pay the card off each month, and I will not use the card if I don't have the money to pay for the item I am purchasing (like if we get plane tickets, I will have the cash in my bank account BEFORE I use the credit card then pay the credit card off the minute to charge hits my account).My goal is to #1 prove that I can handle credit responsibly, and #2 grow some sort of credit history (which I hope to never need but you never know, at least having a good credit history as opposed to no credit history is--I think--a good thing).  We shall see.  I used to look at new credit cards like \"free\" money raining down on me.  Now I look at them like someone is handing me a porcupine--it's a nice, interesting animal best handled carefully and with extreme caution."},

I would have to do it for all.We fell off the no-spend wagon and we have spent money every day so far this month.  January will definitely be a no spend month with the added feature of planning ahead (stocking up on food and filling the car's gas tank).  Ugh...it takes so much effort NOT to spend money!"},

They would still be shell shocked from the death of a spouse and then, after the dust settled from the funeral and friends and family went home, they would be left to figure out what to do.  A few were well set up due to previous planning but the vast majority were left near homeless (sometimes actually homeless) because, well, people don't usually do a lot of planning for the death of them self or their spouse, and the surving spouse can be left with legal bills, a greatly diminished income, debt up to their ears, etc.Which brings me back to the topic of this post.  When I die (or if the hubby goes before me) I want the one of us left to be relatively set financially (and emotionally and socially as well).  Here's what people should be left upon the death of a spouse:A paid off houseA newish, paid off carNo debtA life insurance policyA Will, Living Will, and Medical Power of AttorneyA passive income streamA paid for and arranged funeralA list of important info A social safety netThings to do, places to beAnd here's why:With a paid off house and no mortgage to pay each month, the surviving spouse has #1 an asset that can be sold, and #2 a place to live until they decide what to do without worry of being evicted/foreclosed on.A newish, paid off car gives the surviving spouse a mode of transportation and no worry about having the car repoed if they can't make the payments.  Newishness makes the car less likely to break down leaving them stranded and/or with big repair bills to pay.No debt should be the standard for everyone, regardless of age.  You don't want to be in the midst of the death of a loved one while at the same time juggling creditors and hoping not to be forced into bankruptcy.A life insurance policy will afford the surviving spouse a clump of money to tide them over during the death and morning period; it will give them the money to pay for everyday expenses as well as money to make decisions about their future without having to worry about finances.When someone dies without a Will or is incapacitated without a Living Will and Power of Attorney, it makes the situation so much more complicated.  The probate process can be complicated and expensive for the surviving spouse and the last thing you want when you are mourning is a legal tangle to deal with.A passive income stream left to the surviving spouse is a wonderful bonus that can mitigate everything from paying regular monthly bills to giving the spouse options for their future.We used to live next to a windowed, elderly lady.  She had no children and no family but had lots of friends.  When she died, I found out that she had planned out and paid for her funeral in advance which was one of the best ideas I'd ever heard of.  There was no scrambling for funds to pay for the funeral, there was no guessing how or what to do in regards to the funeral, and there was no pressure on friends to take on such a responsibility.  Arranging for your funeral and paying for it long before you pass away is a great gift to leave your friends an family.It's amazing how many people don't know a lot about their spouse's/family's important info.  When a client would come in after the death of a spouse, I would ask them \"did he have a will?  Where is it?  Did he leave investment accounts? With what institutions and what are the account numbers?  Who are your creditors?  How much is owed to them?\"  And the questions would go on and the answers were almost always \"I don't know.\"  Sorting that kind of thing out after a spouse dies is time consuming and needlessly complicated.  By leaving a list of everything from social media passwords to the location of important documents to financial account information, leaves your spouse with fewer problems to sort out after the fact.One thing many people don't think about leaving their spouse if they should die is a social safety net.  This problem is more common with men whose spouses die than with women, as women often keep in touch with a wide range of friends and family while many men let their wives keep up the social aspects of the couple's life.  The remaining spouse needs the social support of friends and family before, during, and far beyond the funeral and it is an important part of keeping the remaining spouse active and busy and not in danger of succumbing to depression or worse.It is important that both spouses keep active as they age.  Even though they may not be working, having places to be and things to do (bowling league on Monday, walking group on Tuesday, book club on Wednesday, etc) creates a structure during the day and it is this structure which can ease a person into widowhood by giving them a reason to get out of bed each day."},
{"title": "My December Goals", "date": "Sunday, December 1, 2013", "text": "I find that I can achieve more goals when I make the time limit shorter--like a month's worth of goals instead of a year's worth at a time.  So I have made the following list of things I want/need to do for this month:p.s. One thing I love about Vegas is that my roses are STILL blooming in December! (see photo above)p.s.s.  While we are still mindful of our spending, today we did hit up the $1 store for a few groceries and I couldn't resist the Black Friday sale at REI (which actually lasts through December 2nd) and bought a backpack for my walking.  It is a Gregory Fury pack which is usually $99 but I got it on clearance at REI with an additional 30% off which made the total price $38.  I hope I like it--I have the very worst luck picking out packs when I am not able to try them on; fortunately REI has a good return policy so if I don't like it, it will go back to the store.  Now on to trekking poles...Now to my list:Sell four items on Craigslist (I listed three today) two sold as of 12/6 (only sold two items, will relist the other two next month)Get a Christmas tree and decorate it  (decided not to do this as its only the hubby and I, no kids this year)Plan something for Christmas dinner (done 12/25)Plan something for New Year's EveGet hubby a Christmas gift (done 12/14)Get a haircut  done 12/9Go to the dentist for a root cleaning (will try to do this in January, need to save up for it) Attend a new genealogy group meeting to see if I want to join  (didnt do this, I emailed for meeting info and got no reply so I will try this next month)Attend my current genealogy group meeting this month (done 12/21)Pay for my volksmarching membership renewal (done 12/14)Attend the annual volksmarching dinner (done 12/14)Go to a showTry a new Thai restaurant (Lotus of Siam, it's supposed to be really good) done 12/3Go to the Galaxy theaterGo to Mt Charleston and play in the snowDo four walks (North Strip VM, Sahara-Russell-Sahara, Mandalay to Golden Nugget, Red Rock Loop) (will put these off til January and February as part of my marathon training)Get new walk shoes (I have new shoes but they haven't been great for long distance walking) (done 12/18)Get a new day pack for walking (done 12/5)Get trekking poles (done 12/20)Get a headlamp (I will need it for night walks) (I won't need this until April or May so I will wait on getting it)Buy/send small gifts to two friends in Japan  (done 12/10)Buy/send four gifts to my friend and her family in Japan for Christmas  (done 12/10)Buy/send my friend a birthday gift (this will go with the above gifts in the mail)  (done 12/10)Finish a new brochure for my volksmarch group (done 12/26)Try to get 60 hours of work done for my friend (not going to happen...unfortunately...will probably get like 20 hours this month)"},
{"title": "Day 30 No Spend November (And the Wrap Up)", "date": "Saturday, November 30, 2013", "text": "Today is November 30th and thus the last day of my no spend challenge.  It is also the hubby and my 23rd anniversary (23 years married, 27 years--exactly--living together...wow!).  We went out for dinner tonight for our anniversary and spent a grand total of $8.77 (77 cents on the meal because we had a $50 gift certificate that hubby won playing free online poker and $8 for the tip).  The dinner was fine but I am just not a fan of fancy restaurants.  I prefer to eat at home and if there is something I don't make very well (like Indian food) then I enjoy going to hole-in-the-wall restaurants that are cheap and filled with lots of locals.  But we had the gift certificate so the meal was basically free so I can't complain.And now, channeling my inner Dar, I give you these facts and figures about our no spend month:we had 10 no spend dayswe spent $100 on gas (I only recorded $50 spent on gas but hubby keeps records of this and said we did indeed spend $50 twice)we spent $147.65 at the grocery storewe spent $23 on tipswe spent $29.66 on eating out (including my Blasts, hubby's coffee, fast food, etc)we spent $11 on hobbies (hubby's bowling, my volksmarches)I spent $40 on a giftwe spent $108.59 on unexpected expenses (sale on cologne, dentist, certified mail, a copy because my printer broke down, and wiper blades because ours flew off the car)And some conclusions:having no spend days saves money, the more the betterstaying home more often leads to no spend days AND saves us gasgroceries were pretty low but we had a lot of meat in the freezer so an average month might see us spend $200 on groceries (we cook almost everything from scratch so don't buy much processed food).  The $1 and 99 cent stores save us A LOT of money as does shopping loss leaders at our local grocery store.  I need to kick my junk food habit.we spent too much money on tips, mostly in casinos for coffee in the poker room and at restaurants.  We need to work on cutting this down.we spent too much eating out.  Like I said, I don't even like eating out but most of these expenses are because I didn't plan ahead and make something to eat at home then ended up out and about and starving.  The good thing is that nearly everywhere we eat, we get the meal part free with hubby's casino comps, the bad part is that we still need to tip (see above)our hobby expenses will skyrocket next month.  Hubby pays for his bowling a month at a time--for three leagues--which he will do in the upcoming week (he paid at the end of October which is why this expense didn't show up in November.  Also my annual dues for my volksmarch club and genealogy club will be coming up in December.We generally don't spend much on gifts but December will see a jump in this category as well because of Christmas.I think unexpected expenses show up each month, some small and some big.  Fortunately November was a small expense month in this category (although I would have been happy not to have had to go to the dentist or buy wiper blades or come across a really good sale on cologne)Some things that helped with this challenge: Hubby and I were both on the same page with this challenge and both working towards the same goal (we wouldn't have cut our expenses nearly as much if one of us was spending like crazy and the other wasn't)We don't have kids at home (with just the two of us, we don't have the huge grocery bills we did when the kids lived at home.  Also kids always seem to have a massive amount of unexpected expenses)We are both retired (this makes it much easier to have the time to cook from scratch, shop sales, decide not to leave the house for a day, etc)We don't have bad habits that drain our finances (some years ago we would think nothing of eating out two or three meals a day, nearly every day.  Ditto for stopping by Starbucks on an almost daily basis on the way to meetings, mostly out of habit)In summary:If you want to reign in your spending, doing a no or low spend month is a great way to accomplish this.  Really making an effort to NOT spend money is a good exercise in self control, and making yourself record every expenditure then doing the calculations at the end of the month is a great way to see where your money is going.  So many times we spend money on small things and not even notice it but small things really add up!And next month:I am going to do a health month.  I know people always start their health challenges in January but through (much) previous experience I know this doesn't work for me (I generally fall off the wagon around day 10).  I will make a concerted effort to move more and eat better among other things.  Of course, I hope to retain the money habits I have started to establish during the last month."},

{"title": "Day 28 No Spend November", "date": "Friday, November 29, 2013", "text": "Yesterday was Thanksgiving so we stayed home and spent $0.  Hubby and I cooked up a storm and invited the cousins over for dinner where we all proceeded to eat until we couldn't eat any more (and then a while later we ate some more!).  We ended up with tons of leftovers, most of which we sent home with the cousins, with enough for us to eat a few more meals as well.We had no desire at all to shop on Black Friday (which is now pretty much Black Thanksgiving since many stores opened on Thursday).  So we enjoyed the \"100% off Black Friday sale\" and didn't end up like these people.While I was waiting for the turkey to roast and the potatoes to boil, I decided to calculate what our Thanksgiving meal cost.  Here's the breakdown:Turkey (13 lbs)  $5 (bought on sale after last year's holidays)Stuffing (2 boxes)  $2 Cranberry sauce  $1Dinner rolls  $1Gravy (4 packets)  $2Corn (2 cans)  $2Yams (2 cans)  $2Mashed potatoes $1Cucumber and ranch dressing  $1Rice  $1Filipino stew  $3Pork roast  $4Butter  $2 (used on rolls, in potatoes, etc)Apple pie  $2Pumpkin pies (2 pies)  $3Chocolate cake  $1Soda/bottled water  $2For a grand total of $35 we cooked a huge meals with days worth of leftovers.  The way we saved money on all of this food was by cooking from scratch, buying items on sale, and shopping at the 99 cent store.  We could have halved the cost of the meal by only cooking half of what we did (and we probably still would have had leftovers) but we are used to cooking for a crowd and everyone knows that when they come to our house for dinner they always end up taking food home as well (the cousins even show up with empty food containers we have them trained so well!).  We also could have saved money if I would have made the rolls from scratch, used frozen corn instead of canned, made fresh yams instead of canned, and made my own stuffing (takes a lot of time) and gravy (it never comes out right when I make it from scratch).Overall we had a wonderful Thanksgiving.  I'm off now to eat leftovers for breakfast!"},

Still no internet.So I grabbed by cell phone and computer and raced to the casino so hubby could bowl and I could use the casino's free internet to do a call in meeting with a client and get some work done which required internet access to do (plus I had to stand outside for the entire hour and a half of the meeting call in because it was so loud in the casino).  Not happy.Went home and waited for another tech to come out to the house to fix the internet.  He got there, said \"the line in your street is broken\", (duh), he did a bunch of useless stuff (like replacing a perfectly good co ax cable which didn't need replacing and had absolutely no impact on the dead line outside) and left.  Still no internet.Made an appointment for the dentist because my teeth were bothering me.  I couldn't print off the coupon from his website because my printer needed a new driver (which requires the internet to load).Called a church I tithe to monthly because the payment I made on their website hadn't cleared for over a month; after much research they said their system had a glitch and my debit card wouldn't be charged.  So I need to redo the transaction (which requires internet).Went to Baskin Robbins and got a blast but forgot to get my receipt which has a $1 off coupon on it.Called a supervisor at the cable company to see when the line in the street would be fixed and he said the dispatcher would call me back.  No one called me back.Hubby had to scrounge up some old movies to watch since he watches all of his movies online and we didn't have internet.  He found the Godfather series which is nine hours of movies. Yippee.Needed to get a document out ASAP for a client.  Had to do the research for in ON MY CELL PHONE which was the only internet access I had then transferred the document to my cell phone so I could email it to her.I billed another client who was three months behind in paying me so I sent a passive aggressive note about needing to be paid.Overall a crappy day and we still didn't end up with internet by the time we went to bed."},

{"title": "Shoes, Walking, and an Update", "date": "Thursday, October 10, 2013", "text": "First the update:The tablet went back to the store.  It didn't do anything more than my cell phone does and I couldn't work on it so I am back to schlepping my laptop around so I can work where ever we happen to be (generally at casinos; fortunately there is usually free wi fi).  A tablet would be nice to have, but to me, it isn't worth paying so much money for something that just gives me a bit more screen real estate than my cell phone.Then the shoe story:Right after I returned the tablet, I went down the street and stopped in at Ross.  I have been wanting to get some new walking shoes since my current shoes have hundreds of miles on them already.  The women's department didn't have any shoes I like (never do actually which is why I usually buy shoes at TJ Maxx) so I went to find hubby in the men's department and spied some Brooks Dyad shoes in size 7 mens for $30 (!!!).  I have been wanting Brooks shoes for ages because serious walkers rave about them but I couldn't bring myself to pay $120 for a pair of shoes.  These shoes fit perfectly!  I usually wear an 8 in women's shoes and these were supposed to run small anyway so I snagged them!  After wearing them for a few miles I was in love with them.  So comfy right out of the box and no problems with my feet (in shoes not made for walking, my feet are usually in pain within a mile or so).  I raved about them so much we went back the next day to another Ross and hubby got a pair which he continues to rave about today (he even got up early and walked with me this morning--I think it was because of the shoes!).  When we were getting hubby's shoes, I found another pair of size 7 men's Brooks Adrenaline shoes for $30 (different model, different color) so hubby said I should go ahead and get them since I will for sure use them.  Now I am the happy owner of two pair of fancy Brooks shoes.  Hubby also said that with two new pair of tennis shoes and two new pair of Keen sandals I probably won't need shoes for a couple of years...he is probably right.And the walking story:I have been making an effort to walk every day for the past week.  I am even keeping my mileage in a spreadsheet to keep me motivated which seems to be working!  A couple of days ago hubby was playing at the casino and I decided to walk home (about five miles).  After a mile or so, I found a set of 15 pound dumb bells sitting along the side of the road.  There was no way I would be able to carry 30 extra pounds home so I set them at the base of a sign, came back two days later in the car, and they were still there!  We now have a new set of dumb bells (which will probably get sold on Craigslist or at a garage sale).In other walking news, I saw that there is a guy who has been walking around the world since 1998 (!!!) heading to Las Vegas so I tweeted him and asked him out to lunch.  I think what he is doing is really cool and would love to treat him to a meal and learn more about his adventures.  Since people who walk like that can burn over 10,000 calories a day, I figured a buffet would be good :)  (paid for with hubby's comps of course).Finally a walking thing and an update:  Since the weather has calmed down from inferno hot to warm high 70s we have been walking to do our grocery shopping.  According to hubby who keeps track of these things, in previous months we have always spent $150 a month in gas for the car (about $50 every week and a half or so) but in September we only spent $100 (which is a 30% reduction!).And a totally unrelated thing: hubby plays online poker each evening while he is watching movies (how he does both on one computer is beyond me!).  It is free to play and the winners can get some cool prizes.  He won once before over a year ago and just last week he won again.  This time he won two nights at the Golden Nugget in downtown Las Vegas, $100 in food comps for the Golden Nugget, a free show for two, and $50 in gambling coupons.  Yeah!  This will be our free vacation for the fall (even though it is only a few miles away...but it is free!).  Yeah hubby!"},
{"title": "Saving Money on College", "date": "Tuesday, October 8, 2013", "text": "I just came across this article with 15 tips on saving money at college and I thought, \"I can save even more money than the ideas listed!\"  Obviously I am not busy enough...  But here are some ideas anyway:Books.  Grovel on reddit or Craigslist for cheap books, rent, or borrow.  My first year at college I bought all new books, the second year I bought all used books, the third year I would borrow the books I needed from the library or from classmates for a quick read (I remember everything I read so I never had to take notes or highlight stuff or anything like that).Supplies.  Hit up the late July/early August school supply sales at Walmart and other stores.  If you are really worried (like pre med classes) email the professor or former students of the class and ask about special supplies you might need.School branded clothing.  I see UNLV gear every week at our local Goodwill.  Hit up local thrift stores for school branded clothes.Banking.  Find a no-fee bank or credit union and open your own savings/checking account (these can often be found through parents--their employer may let employee's kids open their own account; based on where you live--Podunk credit union--which you can use no matter where you go to school with internet banking; or close to college).  I also never recommend linking accounts with others (including parents).  For emergencies there is always Western Union.Food.  I worked at restaurants all through college and ate maybe 75% of my meals there for free.  That saved A LOT of money.Credit cards.  NO.  Just no.  Debit card is good.Freebies.  YES. Always ask for a discount and take up free/cheap hobbies (better yet, if you like tennis, for example, get on the tennis team and get a scholarship to help pay for college).  Between work, school, and tennis practice you will be too tired to go out partying at the local bars and spending your money.Home entertainment.  Get a small TV with an over the air antenna if you must but otherwise, work and study should take up so much time you don't have time for movies and 60\" TVs.Cell phones.  TMobile has a $30 unlimited text/data and 100 talk minute plan.  That is a great plan for students who don't talk much anyway.Computers.  A $300 Toshiba from Best Buy should last you all four years of college and beyond.  A new Macbook Air should only be used if it was given to you for free as a gift.Printers.  When we were traveling I rarely printed anything.  If I did need to print something I could do it for a dime or so at the local library or have a friend print it out for me.Budget.  If you can work all summer, use the glob of money you earn to pay a year's worth of cell phone payments, and divide up the rest by nine months of school.  If that only leaves you with $100 each month for nine months you should probably get a part time job.Budgeting apps.  I like pen and paper better but to each his own.Ask for gifts.  A good idea but the best gift would be going to university near home where you can live with the folks for free and get meals from grandma on a regular basis.  You will save a ton of money this way.Scholarship.  Yes.  Apply for any and every scholarship you qualify for.  A two hour application which nets you $2000 for school pays you a wage of $1000 per hour!  And five other things:If you can get by without a car you will save A TON of money.  Bring a bike instead.Be leery of roommates and signing apartment leases with others.  Most of these situations implode and leave all involved with a bunch of debt, collections, etc.  Better to rent a room from an elderly lady with a big, empty house near campus if necessary.  Even better is to trade work for rent if possible.Don't ever co-sign for anyone!  Not your college roommate, not your best friend, not your new, cute SO.Think of college as a job and not a last opportunity to party for four years straight.  Your job is to get through college as quickly as possible with as little expense as possible.Don't take out student loans.  Extreme yes, but on the flip side, many students who do take out massive loans leave college with extreme debt and low-wage jobs which is a horrible way to start out your adult life.  If you must, start at community college and pay as you go.  It may take longer but leaving school with no debt is a rarity and the best way to launch yourself into the world of work."},
{"title": "Broke Down and Got a Tablet Today", "date": "Sunday, October 6, 2013", "text": "I've been thinking about getting a tablet for the longest time.  Researching tablets.  Playing with tablets at Best Buy and Office Depot. (But as you can see from the picture, I haven't even mastered the computer yet...ayayay. I can't get the picture to turn sideways!).Anyway, I checked the ads this morning and saw that Office Depot had 10\" Lenovo tablets on sale for $229 so I broke down and bought one.I had a number of concerns about getting a tablet:Cost was a big factor.  I have been really wanting a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 but they are close to $400(!).  Apple tablets are even more (but I am not an Apple fan so this is kind of a non-issue).  Then I was worried that I wouldn't use it.  In theory, I will take it everywhere with me and be able to work anywhere.  In theory.Plus it is one more gadget to keep track of.I was also wondering if I could ditch my cell phone all together and use this tablet.  It doesn't have a 3g or 4g connection but it does get wifi and most places I go have free wifi...but not all.I was even hoping that I could replace my laptop with a tablet.  That would be great!And after playing with my tablet all day, I have found that:You get what you pay for.  While the price was very reasonable and the tablet itself is pretty good, I found that some apps are not configured for Lenovo tablets (I'm guessing I wouldn't have a problem loading these on a Samsung tablet).I love the fact that it is so small and portable but it's still big enough so that I can easily read stuff on it.It doesn't multitask and nearly all of the work I do on my computer (as opposed to reading the news or using social media) requires both writing and research at the same time.  I also do a lot of formatting documents and I am not sure how feasible this would be on a tablet.Ditching my cell phone all together probably won't work that well.  I did put a texting app on it as well as Skype but there will be times (like when we are driving or in the mountains) where if I needed to make a phone call I would be out of luck.In conclusion:I can return the tablet within fourteen days if I don't like it (this may, in fact, happen).On the other hand, I have wanted to get hubby a tablet so he may get this one if I decide I want to pay more for a better tablet and decide to buy the Galaxy.I will play with this tablet for a couple more days and figure out if there are any good ways to really use the tablet for work.I will also consider getting another type of tablet (like a Surface or an Envy which I understand can multitask and use MS Office programs, etc) which is a little more \"computer-ish\" and a little less \"tablet-ish\"."},
{"title": "All Ready to Hike and Nowhere to Go", "date": "Saturday, October 5, 2013", "text": "Hubby's hiking ensemble is complete!  He found another golf club at the Goodwill for $2 and cut of the head making for a pair of walking sticks.  Right next to the golf clubs he found a Camelback day pack for $2.50 (original price $80 for the newest version of the pack) and although it is missing the hydration bladder, he just hooked his water bottle onto it and \"ta da\" he is ready to hike.  Unfortunately our weekly hike is cancelled because our government can't get its sh*t together.  The government shutdown continues and although it doesn't really impact us (if they decide not to send hubby's pension or social security check it will DEFINITELY impact us) it is annoying when there are little things you can't do like go to national parks or the commissary at the base.  \"I'll negotiate as long as you give me everything you ask for\"...from the President no less.  Ugh.  I've pretty much stopped watching the news.In other news:REI is giving an extra 20% off for members this weekI went to our local reddit meet up last week (which was on my annual goal list, the list that I deleted in a fit of angst).  I intended to stay for a half hour and two hours later I was still chattering away.  Nice people!I am going to meet up with this guy when he gets to Vegas next week.  He is walking around the world and I thought 'how cool is that' so I intend to walk a bit with him and bring him food and water if he needs it.Today it looks like we will go to a quarter horse show (free) and a cowboy BBQ cook off (also free).Enjoy your weekend!"},

{"title": "Shoooooes...And Shopping", "date": "Friday, September 20, 2013", "text": "First, the shopping...We made our usual Wednesday shopping rounds ($1 store, grocery store, Walmart, Goodwill, etc) and I realized that I am a cross dresser (in the best sense of the word....this was going to be the headline for this post--\"Cross dressing!--but I thought it was a bit racy, anyway...).  I realized that when I shop, I hit not only the women's section (medium, small sizes) but also the boys section (extra large) and the men's section (small) too.  I am more than happy to wear boy's and men's clothes if they are priced right, look good, and fit right.  For boy's and men's clothes I usually look for interesting t shirts, hoodies, and jackets (cool, name brand ones).  I would probably wear their pants as well but I can't fit my large butt into them.  Oh well.  And this isn't just something I do.  Recently the hubby was looking for a pair of shoes and while the store didn't have the ones he liked in his size (size 8.5), the women's section featured the exact same shoe he was looking for (size 10) which fit him just fine.  Also, when I buy other items (wallets, backpacks, travel gear) I try to refrain from getting said item in hot pink and instead pick a neutral color because more often than not hubby will end up with my hand-me-downs and vice versa.  We seem to have the same taste and this makes our money stretch further.So the moral of this shopping story is to expand the boundaries of what is \"normal\" to wear.  If you are small enough, cheap kids clothes on the clearance rack may be just perfect for you.  Ditto checking out the men's section for well-made, often lower priced clothing that meets your needs.And the shoe story...As we were making our rounds we stopped by TJ Maxx.  While I wasn't looking for anything in particular, I always check out their shoes and handbags sections because they always have great deals on these items and they are almost always good quality, name brand stuff.  Well, I found an excellent deal on these Keen shoes (in the photo above), and while I am NOT one to buy multiples of a single item, the fact that I love these kinds of shoes, plus the fact that I was looking for some sort of sandals because my old ones have been worn to death over the past three years, AND the fact that they were $19.95 a pair made me buy both of them.The moral of this shopping story is that when presented with a really, really good deal on an item that you know for sure you will use, stock up!"},
{"title": "An Update and Another Clever Hubby Trick", "date": "Monday, September 16, 2013", "text": "I have to start labeling all of hubby's clever, money saving tricks!  Anyway, hubby has to have coffee every morning.  Even though I can easily make him a pot of coffee (the cheapest option), he likes the flavored coffees like those expensive little square tins of instant coffee (with a main ingredient of SUGAR).  We've tried just making coffee and adding the flavoring stuff but the flavored creamers are expensive so he keeps going back to the instant stuff. Now I think we have pretty much got the coffee situation figured out.  He starts with a Walmart brand flavored instant coffee (cheaper than the little square cans of name brand stuff) then he mixes it with a jar of instant coffee from the $1 store.  For a total of $4 he ends up with enough flavored instant coffee to last nearly a month.And an update:Yeah for the new Miss America!  We haven't watched a pageant in years but it was on last night and we got engrossed in it and it was fun to watch.  We were cheering for the Army girl but Miss New York was also great (her talent was awesome).  I have no idea why it is a big deal that she is of Indian descent since nearly everyone in the US is descended from somewhere else.We went on our first hike of the season yesterday.  It was short and interesting and to a place we haven't been before...overall fun.  Also, it is amusing as we go with professors from UNLV and one plant or bird sighting can bring everyone scurrying over at a run to see it (I had to laugh when we were driving in a caravan to the start; someone in the lead car saw a plant on the side of the road, and people from no less than six cars quickly parked, got out of their cars, and ran across the road to see it).I'm working (kind of).  One of the smaller projects my friend is contracting with me to do is getting off the ground so it looks like I will actually be earning money this month.  I need to save money for Christmas!I'm a bit worried about the BIL.  He headed off to hike the Grand Canyon, by himself, with a 60 pound pack, without having worked out for months, and with a permit good for only two days (which means he will have to hike fast and the last six+ miles will be straight up the side of the canyon!).  EeekkkPeople in Colorado are getting hammered by flooding and some psycho decides to shoot up a military base today...there never seems to be a shortage of bad news :("},
{"title": "Yeah It's Fall!", "date": "Saturday, September 14, 2013", "text": "Fall is finally here in Las Vegas which probably doesn't mean much to most people (the temps here are in the mid 90s compared to the 110s...it really does make a difference though!).  This means that we no longer need to hibernate inside the air conditioned house all day and our activities tend to really pick up.  Here's what we are doing:Hubby has joined not one but three bowling leagues.  This is convenient because it is right after bingo and right next door to the bingo hall.  Fortunately the fees are pretty cheap ($7 to $10 for each league which is super cheap compared to what he used to pay in Seattle).Hiking is starting.  We will do our first group hike of the season tomorrow.  These are free and we only need to drive to the trail head to meet the group and the guide.I want to roller skate at least once a week with the seniors (I'd like to do this twice a week but it is so far away).I also want to do more technical hiking with another group (which means hubby won't go because he only walks a few miles at a time; we will have to figure out how to do this with only one car).Every other Saturday I will walk with the volksmarchers which is fun and cheap ($3 for each walk so I can get credit towards the mileage I do).Other than that, I really miss the Pacific Northwest in the fall (and even New England for that matter).  Fall is my favorite season because the air gets a little chilly and because the trees are all changing colors and the harvest is wrapping up--none of which happens in Las Vegas.  But I will enjoy getting out in nature more even if nature consists of rocks and sand and more rocks :)"},
{"title": "Hair and Makeup", "date": "Tuesday, September 10, 2013", "text": "Here's a bit about how I save money on hair and makeup.  Disclaimer:  I may be the least fashionable person you meet so there is that.  Plus my hair has never been in a popular style (well, maybe once in the 80s) and if I didn't think eyebrows were a complimentary item on my face I probably wouldn't even wear make up.  Anyway, here we go:Hair:I pay $12 plus a $3 tip to get my haircut at Great Clips.  A few years ago I wouldn't have been caught dead in Great Clips as I had to go to a salon but that was before we cut our income by 75% and I decided I liked freedom more than money.  I get haircuts here about once every four months and try to look for coupons that drop the price to $6.95 (these come out around back to school time and Christmas time).In between haircuts at Great Clips I have hubby trim my hair.  For the longest time he said \"no way\" when I asked him to cut my hair but a while back he gave it a try and my hair came out fine (actually my hair is so kinky and curly that you really can't tell when it isn't fine).I color my own hair (Garnier Nutrisse is awesome!).  I often find coupons that take a dollar or two off the hair color so I pay between $6 to $8 for the color and then do it myself (really simple as you just rub the color in, wait 30 minutes, then wash it off).  The first time I had my hair colored at the aforementioned salon it cost $180 (highlights and all) and I ended up blond.  I make a miserable blond and couldn't wait to get that color out of my hair.  Now I use a light brown and I am much happier.  Also, the first few times I colored my hair I had hubby do highlights (a darker all over color then a lighter color put on sections and wrapped up in foil).  This came out OK but took a lot of time so now I just use one all over color and it looks fine.I use Dollar Store shampoo (VO5 Green Tea) with the occasional bottle of Pantene bought on sale with a coupon.I use a bit of conditioner if my hair is longer because the ends are so brittle.  My last bottle lasted over a year.Makeup:Makeup is expensive.  I don't even use the expensive kind of makeup (Lancome, MAC) but just the typical Maybelline/Cover Girl stuff and it is still expensive so I try to find coupons to buy my makeup with in order to save money.When I was working during the summer I used some of my earnings to buy a complete set of makeup (picture above) because I knew I would be running out in the fall and I knew that it would be a near $50 purchase so right now when I am out of makeup and have very little money I am happy I planned ahead and did this.Fortunately a complete set of makeup for me is just the basics--lipstick, eyeliner, brow liner, cover up, and powder.  I don't like the feel--or the weird look--of foundation on my face and eye shadow tends to look crease-y the older I get (I guess it fills in the lines around me eyes? eekkk).I've tried some makeup from the $1 store and didn't like it (the liner pencils were too hard and the lipstick had no staying power).That's it.  I'm pretty low maintenance in this department and don't even own a hairdryer, curling iron, or flat iron as I just comb out my hair after I wash it and it bounces back into place.  I look in the mirror about once a day, and otherwise don't worry too much about my looks...or lack thereof! :)  Plastic surgery is out of the question (invasive procedures give me the shivers) as is any aging/reduce wrinkles/etc serum that promises the fountain of youth."},

{"title": "Sick!", "date": "Saturday, August 31, 2013", "text": "I have spent the last few days at home with the hubby and the BIL who are both sick as dogs.  The BIL has been sick for a solid week and the hubby seems to have picked up the virus a few days ago.  Fortunately I (crossing fingers) didn't seem to get it although I still get to listen to two boys being sick which we all know is much more dramatic than when women get sick.  So I have been the chief cook (laughable) and bottle washer over the past few days.  Fortunately both seem to be on the mend which is a good thing.  Here's some frugal tips:I'm glad we picked up a half dozen boxes of tissue last time they were on sale.  Although we rarely use tissue (except for allergy season), they have both been blowing (literally, figuratively) through boxes and boxes of them this week.When I was working at the Dollar Store last Christmas, I saw that the store had Thera Flu on sale for a dollar a box (usually about $3.50 a box at Walmart) and I bought bunches and bunches of the stuff then.  They have also been using a lot of Thera Flu this past week too.My cooking skills aren't great on a good day but I have been managing to pull off three meals a day.  Fortunately (again) we stocked up on canned soup months and months ago when it was on sale.  We never eat canned soup but it sure comes in handy when people are sick.  My latest creation: Arroz Caldo; a chicken and rice soup that hubby particularly craves when he is sick.  I simply took a can of cream of chicken soup, added the required can of water (not milk when people are sick), sprinkled on some powdered ginger and ground garlic, added some cooked rice, heated, stirred, and \"ta da\"...Arroz Caldo...kind of. They both play poker everyday so being home-bound has been difficult.  Fortunately they can play poker on line, watch it on TV, and discuss poker, ad nauseum, while they are stuck at home.  We also picked up a couple dozen movies last week at the library which has worked to keep boredom at bay.Other than that, there is not much else to do except sleep, deal with the symptoms (Tylenol for fever, etc), keep hydrated and reasonably fed, and wait until it passes."},

{"title": "5 Ways to Pay More Up Front and Save Money", "date": "Wednesday, August 28, 2013", "text": "We just paid our semi-annual car insurance payment and it dawned on me that there are a few ways that paying more money up front can actually save us money:Get a 15 year mortgage instead of a 30 year mortgage.  We did this on our first two houses and it really did save us a lot of money in interest over the decades (plus it was cool that I had a paid off house in my mid 30s!).  With our current house, we did do a 30 year mortgage because I wasn't working and we didn't want to squeeze our already fixed income too tightly but (hopefully) any additional income in the future will go to pay down the principal on our house as quickly as possible (we won't refinance to a 15 year mortgage because the current interest rate on our loan is so low that it can't be beat by current mortgage rates).Get a three or four year car loan.  Ideally you would pay cash for a car but many people need a car and they also need a loan in order to finance it.  One of the worst financial mistakes I made in my life was getting long term leases on my new cars (and subsequently rolling them over and rolling them over).  Leases are pretty much a rip off (think four year lease then another five or six year loan to pay off the balance of the car...that's a really bad idea).  Yes, your car payments on a three year car loan will be super high but most of that money will be going towards principal and your car will be paid off super fast.We always pay our car insurance in semi-annual payments.  This reduces the cost slightly because if we pay monthly, there is a service charge but by paying all at once, we get to skip the service charge each month (this is the same for our house insurance as well).Some of our utilities allow us to pay on a quarterly/semi-annually/yearly basis in order to avoid service charges.  We pay our sewer bill annually which avoids a service fee each month and we also pay our garbage bill quarterly to avoid similar fees.I don't use credit cards.  This is kind of a no-brainer, but by paying up front and in full for everything I buy, I avoid paying interest (those great sale prices aren't so great if you end up paying for the item over the course of a year!)."},

{"title": "From the 'You Get What You Pay For' File", "date": "Sunday, August 4, 2013", "text": "After waxing poetic about saving money yesterday, and raving about going cheap for my new camera a while back, my brother-in-law and I were comparing pictures from our hike yesterday and it hit me--while I was trying to save money when I bought my camera, in this particular case, I kind of got what I paid for.I'm not a photographer by any meansl but I do take a lot of pictures.  I like the photos I take to be exceptionally clear whether or not they are \"quality, professional level photographs\" (which they aren't but if I am going to publish them I want the to look as crisp and clear as possible).So while I was comparing the photos I and my BIL took at the exact some time of day, at the exact same location, with the exact same subject in the photos, I found that my photos were not very good at all.  His photos jumped off the screen with their clarity and mine were kind of blah.Here's the photo I took:Here's the photo he took:To me, when the photos are blown up on my computer, I can see quite a difference.  Of course, the photo he took is about quadruple the megapixles of the photo I took but still I was disappointed with the overall quality of the photos I took compared to his (we basically took identical photos all during the hike).So this morning I hopped on the internet and did a bit of research and found that a camera that is a step above my old camera (that I somehow broke) received rave reviews.  It was $100 more than what I paid for my latest camera but ranked with much more expensive point and shoot cameras.  So I packed up my new camera and headed over to Best Buy.  I was two days past the 15 days they give customers for returns (it was day 17 and they clearly state that returns must be done within 15 days) but I talked to the manager and she was very nice about letting me exchange my camera for another one.  I handed over an additional $100 and walked out with a Canon Powershot Elph 330 HS.  I'm determined to take better care of this camera than the last two that I broke.The moral of this story?  There are many times that you can \"go cheap\" with things you are buying but there are other times when it makes sense to pay a bit more in order to get a higher quality product (especially if it is a product you will use all the time and it performs better than the cheaper alternatives)."},

Although my in-laws can well afford their travels (they both make over six figures each year) and they are positively dripping in top-shelf REI gear, we all enjoyed this outing equally even though I don't make anything close to six figures and don't own a single item from REI.  Here's a gear comparison:Their hats cost $80 each at REI.  I got a similar Columbia hat from the Goodwill for $1.50.Their sunglasses (Raybans) average around $100 a pair.  Mine were from the $1 store for, well, $1.Sunscreen probably cost about the same from Walmart.Their daypacks (Camelbacks) cost about $150 each.  My daypack, on sale at TJ Maxx, cost $7.95.  I needed to add two bottles of water while they filled up their water bags at home.Their hiking clothes--REI brand--probably cost around $100 each per outfit; my favorite hiking jeans and thin, long-sleeved top came from the Goodwill for about $5 total.They each had their hiking boots, liner socks, and heavy-duty hiking socks (around $150 each) while I wore my $40 New Balance walking shoes.They brought snacks (organic dried fruit and nuts, beef jerky, etc) which costs around $10 each while I brought a few granola bars (6 for $1 at the $1 store).And some hiking costs are the same for everyone:Park entry fees (I chose a scenic hike in a location that was free to access)Gas to get to the trail head (we could have gone further afield but chose a hike that was about a half hour away which saves money on gas).The bottom line:  Don't let the lack of money keep you from enjoying your hobby.  Just because you can't afford the \"right\" gear (they looked like hikers, I looked like, well, an escapee from the Goodwill) doesn't mean you can't tweak the situation to allow you to participate--and enjoy--whatever hobby you choose.  Some people would look at \"real hikers\" and think, \"I can't afford that so I'll just sit home on my couch\" but if it is something you enjoy (I happen to love walking), then by all means, get out and do it.  You can always find cheap gear (example here), find cheaper ways to participate (they hiked Yosemite for two weeks recently, I can't afford that but I can certainly afford local day hikes), and, if it is a hobby you are going to stick with, you can always add improved gear as you go along (you don't need to drop $1000 in a shopping spree at REI when you can take advantage of REI's frequent 20% off one item sale and slowly add to your upscale gear collection)."},
{"title": "5 Things Friday", "date": "Friday, August 2, 2013", "text": "Happy Friday!  Here's five things for today:I started off my morning at 5am doing an 11k volksmarch on the Las Vegas Strip.  My SIL wanted to walk this morning so I thought I would get in another volksmarch at the same time (my goal is to walk 500k in volksmarches this year so every little bit helps).  Since it is so hot in Vegas during the summer, any walking outside needs to start at daybreak.  Also, there are A LOT of drunk people stumbling down the Strip at 5am!I love it when I read about people doing creative, cool (and money-saving) things...like this guy.This afternoon we will take the SIL and BIL out to lunch at the Palms buffet.  It's a win-win-win because #1 we get to treat them (they are always treating us so it is nice to return the favor when we can), #2 it is lunch and not dinner which is great because it is both cheaper and, in my opinion, better to eat such a huge meal earlier in the day instead of later in the evening, and #3 it is technically free because we will be using hubby's comps to pay for it.The SIL will be going to the Bruno Mars concert tomorrow (her ticket cost over $300!!), but we will find cheaper entertainment such as attending a free cowboy mounted shooting event this weekend.  Since we are retired, almost any kind of entertainment needs to be free or free-ish.I MUST work on my book this weekend.  I am so lazy but I really, really, really want to get it done by the end of the month.I hope you have a wonderful weekend!"},
{"title": "Our 15 Sources of Income", "date": "Thursday, August 1, 2013", "text": "Up until a few years ago, the hubby and I were like everyone else.  We worked full time (occasionally for employers, mostly in our own businesses), we had a massive amount of bills (the usual mortgage/utilities/food bills plus car payments/credit card payments/loan payments), and we thought we would never get out of the rat race (it's hard to quit the rat race when one is so comfy and spoiled with material goods). Then the time came when we had the opportunity to make a huge change in our lives (long story short, it started with getting out of debt, then closing my business, then selling everything we owned, then traveling for a while).  While we were traveling we had zero debt and about four small bills each month but now that we have settled down again (we decided we like to go on vacation, not live permanently on vacation) we have the usual bills that everyone else has (mortgage, utilities, food, etc) but fortunately no debts.  This means that while we don't need the big incomes we had in the past, we still need some money to pay our minimal bills each month along with a few treats (like today, the hubby and I went and got massages--the first time in about three years--and it was heavenly.  It cost $40 each and while that seems like a lot to us now--never mind that I was paying $65 for bi-weekly massages years ago--it was a wonderful treat!).In a lifestyle that is hard for most people to understand--I've been trying to explain it to my brother and sister in law who are staying with us this week since they are of the \"I must work 40 hours a week for as much money as possible for the rest of my life\" mindset--we happily live and pay our bills on a range of small income sources.  No two days are ever the same, we have a lot of free time, and, most importantly, we are easily able to pay our bills.  Here's all of the things we have done to create multiple streams of income:Hubby's military pension (there's something to be said for retiring at age 40 with a monthly pension for the rest of your life).Hubby's social security (he decided to draw social security at age 62 instead of waiting until age 70 and it seems to work out well for our purposes).Seasonal jobs (I worked in retail for a month last Christmas, it was interesting work and a nice little additional sum of money in my bank account; I intend to do this again next Christmas and maybe deliver flowers around Valentine's Day and Mother's Day, two other popular seasonal jobs).Temporary jobs (I recently worked for six weeks at the World Series of Poker.  Many people seem to work temporary jobs in Las Vegas for a range of short-term events).Adsense (I make about $50 a month from the ads on my blogs and websites.  I'm sure I could increase this income with more effort and by adding affiliate ads).Royalties (I wrote a book last year, kind of on a whim, and now I make about $100 a month in royalties.  Book two is in the works!).Website building and maintenance (I have made websites since the early days of the internet.  They are pretty basic but each month I get paid from a few clients for updating their websites.  In addition I get paid for building new websites for clients occasionally.  Recently a group of people I used to work with asked me about a bulk rate for building and maintaining all of their agency's websites which will hopefully pan out).Freelance writing (last year I was making about $200 a month writing freelance articles for some online publications.  My main article buyer switched focus and I didn't go looking for new buyers for my articles but that is always something I could do in the future).Freelance gigs (some of my old clients have asked me to do short-term freelance things for them such as grant writing, policy writing, and copy editing; while this isn't a stable source of income, the occasional $250-$500 projects are a nice additional source of income).Remote working (a friend of mine who used to work in the same field as I did would call me to do occasional freelance gigs for her; recently she added me to her payroll as a remote employee so she would not need to get Board approval for each project I did for her.  Now I get a monthly deposit into my bank account, the amount depends on how much work I do).Sell things online (I used to sell quite a few things on eBay and CraigsList; I still do this when I have things to sell such as small electronics, etc, but haven't put much effort into it lately).Have garage sale (I've pointed out before that hubby is a pack rat and our garage is testament to this.  I see another garage sale in our future).Personal services (in the past we have housesat, did a temporary babysitting gig for our room and board, mowed laws, shoveled snow, ran errands, picked people up from the airport, etc.  While this isn't something we actively seek out, if someone asks or says \"I wish I could have someone do...\" we jump at the opportunity).Take in a boarder (I am fascinated with AirBnB but hubby said no way, however, for the past few months the brother-in-law has been working in Las Vegas on a construction job and paying us $400 a month for room and the occasional meal.  It has worked out great since we have two spare guest rooms and we hardly even know he is here).Freebies, rebates, and coupons (although not an income stream, searching for and using every freebie, rebate, and coupon we can find cuts down on the monthly expenses we need to pay; last week, for example, we were able to get hubby a veteran's discount from the county on our annual car registration fee and it dropped the amount we needed to pay from $115 to $33!)."},
{"title": "One Roast Chicken, Ten Meals", "date": "Monday, July 29, 2013", "text": "We picked up a roast chicken for dinner yesterday (sorry, no picture.  By the time I realized I needed a picture of the bird for this blog, it was already wingless and legless and didn't look very good.  Tasty though!).  We do this occasionally because it is cheap ($5.99 for the already roasted chicken from Walmart) and quick (already cooked), and we can stretch that chicken to make a bunch of meals:Roast chicken (wings and legs) for the first meal.  Then we take the rest of the bird and \"de-chicken\" it, using the remainder of the chicken (which is cut into small pieces) to make:Chicken tacos or burritos.Chicken Caesar saladChicken salad sandwichesChicken (with spinach and feta) pizzaChicken soup (toss the carcass in a stew pot and use this as a basis for soup by adding vegies)Chicken nachosChicken instead of meatballs in spaghettiChicken fried riceChicken curry over riceObviously one chicken won't make all of these meals for an entire family but for one person who goes light on the chicken and heavy on the vegetables, you can really stretch one of these birds quite a ways."},
{"title": "I Traded My Goal...For a Grill", "date": "Saturday, July 27, 2013", "text": "At the end of last year, I made up my annual goal list.  One of the goals I put on the list was to attend DEFCON which is an internationally renowned hacker's conference held in Las Vegas each year.  Since the topic fascinates me and I live right here in Las Vegas, I figured this would be a great goal which would also be easily achievable.  Fast forward to today.  DEFCON will start next Thursday--August 1st--but I won't be there.  I had $200 set aside for the conference but then I got to debating with myself (as I so often do) about spending so much money on the conference. On the plus side: it is a fascinating conference, I am kind of enthralled by all of the cool things hackers can do, I love knowledge of all kinds, it is right here in Las Vegas, the attendees are pretty cool (even though the \"rules\" ask people who attend to at least shower every couple of days--a necessary reminder as many attendees are Aspie types who can become totally focused on a single topic to the neglect of everything else, including personal hygiene), and it is a \"thing\" to be able to say you have attended.On the negative side: it costs $180 to attend, it is 10-15 hours for four days straight, I am so not a hacker (even though I am fascinated by hackers, I can barely tweak the code on the websites I make), I don't know anyone else who will be attending, I can pretty much download all of the materials from previous conferences if I want the knowledge, and there are other things I can be spending my limited amount of money on.Which brings me to the grill.  Hubby has been wanting a real grill for ages.  We have never had a \"real\" grill and have instead spent $30 every couple of years to buy a small, tabletop gas grill.  His two year old grill pretty much died a few days ago (after a rare rainstorm during which we forgot to put the grill inside), but he does use the grill all the time.  So today we were at Home Depot and we saw this grill (above) and it had a $129 price tag on it.  I asked the guy about the grill because there was also a $159 price tag on it too and he said that because it had the lower price on it, he would give it to us for $129--a savings of $30 off the actual price. Immediately I thought that this would be a much better use of my $200 (it cost $189 because we had to buy a gas tank to go with it).  So with very little debate, I decided to skip the conference and buy the grill instead.  Hubby was really happy with the purchase and while I would like to go to the DEFCON conference and achieve a goal I had set for myself, logic tells me I made the right decision.Bottom line: it is a good thing that my goals aren't cast in stone."},
{"title": "My Top 10 Best Ever Purchases", "date": "Thursday, July 25, 2013", "text": "Sometimes I will look at an item in my house and think, \"wow that was a really good purchase!\"; either because the item is super useful or super cheap or both.  In no particular order, these are the items that have been really fantastic purchases:#1  A daypack.  It cost $7.95 at TJ Maxx and I have used it for dayhikes, volksmarches, and even overnight trips.  It isn't a famous brand or anything but it is well made, super inexpensive, and has held up for over a year.#2  A Samsung Galaxy S2 cell phone.  Buying this phone took ages (and a lot of debate) because it was $300 which is A LOT of money to me these days.  But I am really glad I got it because besides making it really easy to text and make phone calls, I also keep some Kindle books on there, can easily access the internet and my email, and it contains a bunch of other things to keep me occupied (like a couple of games, Google Sky, etc).#3  A cell phone cover for my cell phone.  At a grand total of $2.95 (including shipping from Hong Kong no less!) it works really well to give an added layer of protection to my cell phone).#4  A treadmill that cost $50 off of Craigslist.  We had a treadmill some years ago (bought at retail of course) but we sold it when we moved.  After we got settled here, hubby wanted another treadmill because he likes to exercise everyday.  What we didn't want to do, however, was pay top dollar for a new treadmill so I went on Craigslist and within one day, we had a nearly new treadmill in our garage (note that hubby likes to watch shows on his computer when he exercises but we didn't want to buy a very tall, probably very expensive, computer table so he made one himself...kind of). #5  Walking shoes.  I paid about $40 for these New Balance shoes made specifically for walking.  They made a HUGE difference!  No longer did my feet cramp or feel like every little bone in my feet were broken after five miles of walking like they did in regular tennis shoes.  These were well worth the cost!#6  A needle threader.  This item came with a sewing kit from the $1 store and I don't know how I ever lived without it.  It makes threading needles SO easy since my vision isn't what it used to be.#7  A small notebook.  This notebook also came from the $1 store.  While I know it would be cheaper (and more modern) to keep my shopping lists and \"to do\" lists on my computer, I still love pen and paper when it comes to making notes or just 'thinking out loud' in order to organize my thoughts.  It's well worth the $1 spent and much cheaper than the $10 notebooks I used to buy at Barnes and Noble.#8  A pocketknife.  I have carried this knife in my purse for probably 25 years.  I think back then it cost about $10 and I have used it for everything from cutting tags off of clothes to opening boxes to even putting a desk together (it has a Phillips screwdriver on it as well as other blades).#9  House shoes.  When we moved to Las Vegas I realized that I didn't have any house shoes (I pretty much got rid of everything when we moved and while we traveled I carried a pair of flip flops with me that I wore outside).  Since we don't wear shoes in the house (no shoes on carpet, clean flip flops on the tile or wood floor parts of the house), I needed some new flip flops.  I found these for $6.95 in the boy's department of Walmart and they have held up extraordinarily well for the past year and a half.  They will probably last for another ten years or so which definitely makes these an awesome buy.#10  Sunglasses.  Who buys sunglasses at the $1 store?  I do!  I don't need fancy, expensive sunglasses but I do need ones that fit well, look good on my face, and work, well, like sunglasses should.  When I came across these at the $1 I loved them (and really loved the price!)."},
{"title": "Costs My Grandparents Never Had to Worry About", "date": "Monday, July 22, 2013", "text": "I came across this article a couple days ago which got me to thinking.  There are A LOT of costs that my grandparents never had to worry about which are now part of almost everyone's monthly bill list.  Here's a typical monthly bill list compared to a typical bill list for a family in the 1950s:Mortgage (they bought their land and home with cash).  Of course they started with a tiny piece of land and a shack and slowly expanded as they had the money.Electricity (this is one bill they had).  Water (they had a well--their only option for water--so no water bill)Sewer (they had a septic tank--no sewer system back in the day in the rural areas they lived in--so no sewer bill)Gas (they were far removed from any natural gas line so no gas bill.  They usually burned wood for heat which they cut down and cured themselves)Trash (they processed their own trash by composting and burning; they produced little trash because they rarely bought anything).Credit card bills (unheard of back then; they paid cash for everything).Cable TV (ditto; they had a TV with \"rabbit ears\" and about three channels).HOA fee (unheard of back then; no HOA bill)Internet (ditto)Cell phone (ditto ditto)Health insurance (in the early days they paid cash for medical care; eventually the union paid for the family's medical care).Car insurance (when this became common my granddad always carried car insurance).Life insurance (ditto)Food (they did shop in grocery stores but they produced as much as their food as possible with a huge garden and orchard.  Hunting and fishing supplemented the meat they would buy or barter for.  They did always have to buy coffee--it was a staple, as were sugar, flower, spices, etc).Eating out (I can count on one hand the number of times my grandparents went out to dinner.  Granddad preferred to eat at home; in later years grandma went out to lunch once a week with the \"Lunch Bunch\" ladies and thoroughly enjoyed eating out).Cars (they always paid cash for their cars and never had a new car--granddad said it was a waste of money to buy new--so he would barter or cajole or otherwise end up with quite decent vehicles for very low cash prices).Gas for the truck (this was a necessity; back then gas was like 35 cents a gallon)Entertainment (they always had a farm in a rural area so entertainment was a barn dance, playing cards with the neighbors, or playing music).Clothing (some was purchased, some was handmade; they never had an excess of clothing or shoes)Telephone (they had a phone when service got to their area; of course they had a \"party line\" for many years)Travel (this was exceptionally rare and neither one ever traveled by plane; they would either drive or take the train to visit family).Things they did pay for that might be a bit uncommon today:Guitars (granddad loved his guitars)Guns, fishing gear, hunting gear (these were necessities of life back then)Livestock (they had horses for a while, chickens, etc)Seeds (they would receive massive orders of seeds each late winter for their farm)Books and magazines (they were avid readers so there were always books and subscription magazines at their house)Canning supplies (grandma canned a ton of food each summer and fall)A huge freezer (for as far back as I can remember they always had a huge freezer full of food)Whiskey (granddad loved his whiskey)Chocolate (grandma loved her chocolate)The bottom line was that they lived simply but had a full life.  They didn't need a lot of \"stuff\" to make them happy but a full freezer and pantry were both a joy to them and a kind of insurance against hard times.  Both had lived through the Depression and were very frugal.  Granddad always had a wallet bursting with cash yet he hardly ever spent it, and grandma saved what little money she had as well (it was called \"pin money\" back then). They seemed to have everything they needed but little extra when it came to extravagances (no fur coat for grandma, no travel to distant lands just because, etc).  Life seemed so simple back then..."},

{"title": "My New Camera", "date": "Wednesday, July 17, 2013", "text": "After another lengthy debate with myself (and hubby chiming in occasionally) I finally decided to buy another camera.  I don't have a very good track record with my cameras--I dropped one and broke it on the way to Vegas and then a few months ago somehow damaged my next camera--so the debate was whether to stick with only the camera on my cell phone (it's OK, not great), get another $200+ camera like the two that I had broken (I didn't really want to spend that much for something that in all likelihood would get broken again), or go with a cheaper camera.I looked online for $100 point and shoot cameras which had good ratings then I looked at the ad for our local Best Buy and saw that they had a Canon Powershot A4000 camera on sale for $89 (a savings of $90 off the original price).  That seemed like a great price so I went online to Amazon and found that their price for the same camera was $104 (sometimes Amazon has items for even less than the sale price at local stores) and that the camera had a four star-rating with over 250 reviews.  I put a lot of stock in other people's reviews and it sounded like just what I needed--a basic camera with a good zoom lens that takes clear photos. Although I like taking photos, I am no photographer so it wouldn't do me much good to get a fancy camera.  On the other hand I do take a lot of photos of the activities we do and the camera on my cell phone didn't work as well as I wanted it to (just getting the photos off of the phone is a giant hassle) so I think this camera, with its easily removable memory card and the nice pictures it takes (so far...I've only taken a dozen quick photos to see how the camera worked) will be just fine.  The new camera is a bit bigger than my previous couple of cameras (I like the camera to be as small as possible because I carry it in my purse all the time) but so far that is the only drawback.Here's a couple sample photos from the new camera:"},

While I am not much of a movie fan anyway, I do like Sandra Bullock and the SIL saw the movie and said it was really funny so I am looking forward to it.  BTW the movie will actually cost us nothing as hubby will use his poker comps to pay for it.After the movie we will go to the Palms buffet for lunch.  This is my favorite buffet in Vegas and again, it will be free with comps.I need to make time to work on my book since I want to have it written and published by the end of August.I am also working on another book--actually just starting--but I would like to see this one done by the end of the year so I need to GET BUSY!I have jury duty this week and need to call in this evening to see if I need to go in tomorrow.We went to see the Vegas show 'Divas' (female impersonators) on Saturday.  It was free through Show Tickets for Locals and we were so happy that this service is completely free (no annual subscription cost like other similar services) that we are going to go to another show later this week.By the end of July I want to do three more volksmarches (I did a 10k last Saturday; since it is so hot here I need to start walking at 5am! eekkk); go to a reddit meet up (on my goal list); and get my concealed carry license (basically take an entire day for the class). I am also working on my genealogy project everyday so I have a list of things to do for this each day (today I need to call the courthouse and see about divorce records from the 1940s and order a couple of old newspapers so I can look up some obituaries).My friend called me yesterday and said \"I need to spend $25,000 over the course of the next year, do you want it?\"  After taking about two seconds to consider the offer I said of course.  She has a bunch of work projects to do and if she doesn't spend the money this year it will be removed from her budget next year so I told her I would be happy to help out (mostly policy writing and research).  I love it when stuff like this just falls into my lap!Another friend in the same field sent me an email yesterday and asked if I would do a website project for her.  Again, I immediately told her I would love to.  Gotta love this 'feast or famine' approach to work and earning an income...And here are some interesting articles I came across recently: here, here, and a cool data aggregator here."},
{"title": "Some Wonderful Links (Annotated, Of Course)", "date": "Friday, July 12, 2013", "text": "In between doing a massive amount of genealogy research yesterday, I was perusing the sidebar of this blog and came across these blog posts which really resonated with me.When people do weird things.  My brother-in-law thinks I'm weird (no job? no desire for a job? no credit cards??  That's weird!) and I think he is kind of weird too (in the nicest possible way but who racks up a $2,000 AmEx bill EACH MONTH??).  As this article points out, people's behavior may seem weird to us but then again our behavior may seem weird to them, the important thing is to accept that what works for us, works for us and what works for others works for others.Goin' Commando With Credit.  This is meeeee.  Now I am so glad I didn't apply for a credit card when the desire hit me to do so.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't want any credit cards, and I don't feel naked!Which pool are you in?  This is me too!  I would almost always choose the quiet pool because I like peace and order and neatness, etc.  But I am glad that I nearly always roll with the punches (like when the SIl says 'can I bring my 3 and 6 year old granddaughters to spend a month with you?' and I smile and say yes even though I am thinking noooooo.  But everything worked out great and I am glad that I get shaken out of my comfort zone on a regular basis.If I Woke Up Broke.  This was a great post because it highlighted what someone should do if they wake up broke.  Unfortunately, during the Great Recession, many people didn't do this.  They found themselves unemployed but kept living on credit and didn't do anything to change their lifestyle to align with their new lack of income.  The result was often massive debt and sometimes homelessness.  I am SO GLAD that when I lost my biggest client a few years ago we immediately decided to change our lifestyle (sold the house and everything else and become homeless vagabonds for a while).  Everything worked out really well for us in the end.  I think when faced with a challenge of this magnitude, extreme, radical action is necessary."},
{"title": "5 Ways We Saved Money Today", "date": "Thursday, July 11, 2013", "text": "It's been a busy day today.  Fortunately, I am all caught up on my cleaning and laundry which gave me a lot of free time to check other things off of my \"to do\" list today.  Here's five random ways we saved money today.We were at our local post office which is located in a 7/11 store when the girl serving us told us that it was free Slurpie day.  I was already planning to go to B & R for a Blast but hubby took advantage of the free offer and got a free pina colada slurpie.Next we went to Baskin Robbins and I used a $1 off coupon for my Blast (these coupons come out on the receipt from previous purchases so I hold onto them until my next visit).  I also got a punch on my \"frequent visitor\" card so my next B & R Blast will be free.I am jumping back into my genealogy research and re-wrote the list of vital records that I need.  I found that I need a couple of birth records from Michigan but the state office of vital records charges $26 (!!) for each record.  So I went to the website for the county that I need the records from and found that they only charge $15 per copy for birth records (saving me $11 on each record I need!).I paid a couple of our utility bills online today, saving the cost of mailing or going to the local offices to pay.I had a little bit of money left over from my last paycheck and wanted a new purse so we went to the outlet mall.  I checked the Coach store but didn't find any purses that caught my eye (which was good because I really didn't want to spend $150 for a purse).  I then went to the Kipling store and while they had a couple of cute purses, I still didn't want to spend $60 on a purse.  Then, we went to Ross so hubby could look for a pair of shoes and I found a super cute Kipling purse on sale for $29.95.  I grabbed it.  That's it in the picture above."},
{"title": "We Saved $126 Today", "date": "Wednesday, July 10, 2013", "text": "When we first moved to Las Vegas, I decided to Google around and see if there were any discounts to be had.  I looked for locals discounts (many spas, restaurants, shows, etc offer discounts for locals), discounts for seniors since hubby is a senior (we found that the Goodwill has 50% off Wednesdays for senior which we take advantage of nearly every week and there are tons of other senior-only discounts around the city), then I looked for anywhere that offered discounts for veterans and hit on the county assessor's website where I found a great deal for veterans--either a small discount on property tax or a pretty big discount on car registration. We chose the car registration discount and used it last year when we registered our car in the state for the first time.  Today after dropping off the SIL and her grandkids at the airport, we headed over to the assessor's office to get our voucher for our annual car registration and found that it had went up to $126 which should more than take car of the fees for registering the car next month since it is old and pretty cheap to register anyway.  Score!"},
{"title": "The Great Credit Card Debate", "date": "Tuesday, July 9, 2013", "text": "Actually it wasn't that great and the only debate going on was inside my head, but over the past few weeks I have been wanting to apply for a credit card.  I think it was because every day that I was working, I was seeing people with massive amounts of cash buying in for poker games and all of them seemed to have a wallet full of credit cards (of course, some of that cash could have came from their credit cards but I digress...).  It seemed like the \"cool\" thing to do--the adult thing to do--to have a few credit cards in my wallet.I haven't had any credit cards for a few years.  At that time I was in debt, I found Dave Ramsey, and I promptly cut up my credit cards, paid them off, then cancelled the accounts.  Back then I felt all cool and impressive and grown up when I flashed my collection of credit cards (I had nearly 20 cards by the time I was 19 years old...I was also deeply in debt for YEARS).So one side of the debate, the reasons FOR applying for some credit cards, were:I could use them in the event of an emergencyI could carry some \"status\" cards like American Express that would show how \"cool and impressive\" I amI could earn air miles, cash back, and other perks when I use themI could build up my credit scoreBasically those were all of the reasons I could think of to have credit cards.But on the other hand, some of the reasons AGAINST getting credit cards that I could think of (to myself, in my head...really my head is a busy place!):If I have an emergency, getting into credit card debt would only create more problems (although the use of the card would temporarily give me some money, I would then be in DEBT and could end up struggling to pay back the debt)If I have a real emergency where I needed cash I can take cash from my savings/emergency fund.  For a bigger emergency, I could easily borrow a large amount of money from a few friends and relatives (I know mixing money and relationships is a really BAD idea but there are a few people who would loan me money if needed)If my self esteem depends on what others think of me because of the things I wear or the credit cards I carry or the car I drive or other material things, I am not as evolved as I should be/want to beMy credit score was high enough to buy a house so it should be just fine without amassing credit card debtI might be more likely to buy things I don't need on credit because I am tempted to rack up air miles or cash back, etc.  That would be a bad thing.I don't have a job as of now which means I don't have a steady income.  Using a credit card would mean I am pledging future income to pay my debt and I #1 don't have a set future income, and #2 don't want to be forced to get a job to pay for debts I rack up (this is the biggest reason I live frugally and don't get myself into debt...I don't want to be forced to work a 9 yo 5 job!) So after much deliberation I decided against applying for any credit cards during these past few weeks when I would technically have the main qualification to get one, namely a job and an income.  It really does make more sense, to me at least, to follow what Dave Ramsey says and carry debit cards with the Visa/Mastercard logo on it them which are backed by actual cash that I have in the bank but can be used just like a credit card.  End of debate."},
{"title": "I'm Done! 10 Things About My Temporary Job", "date": "Monday, July 8, 2013", "text": "Today was the last day of my temporary job with the World Series of Poker.  I can't believe six weeks flew by so fast!  So I celebrated with a Green Tea Frapuccino, compliments of my sister in law, and thought about the past month and a half.  Here's some things about the job:It's a great way to make some extra money (I made almost $4,000--after taxes--during the six weeks). It was a fast-paced job with a bunch of extra bonuses (a paid hour lunch, a free buffet any time we were hungry--some people ate three meals a day there!, super nice co-workers).My \"uniform\" cost a grand total of $15.  They provided the polo shirts with the WSOP logo, we provided black pants (which I bought at the Goodwill for $2.50) and black shoes (which I bought at Payless for $9.95).  If I would have been walking eight hours a day I would have bought a better quality shoe but for just standing in front of my cashier window all day these shoes worked perfectly.People spend a ridiculous amount of money on poker.  I personally took in about $1.8 million during the six weeks.  That is A LOT of money to count!  But in every tournament only 10% of the people will win something and the other 90% lose.  Even with good skill, luck still plays a big part and I couldn't imagine tossing away so much money on what is basically a game of chance.  99.9% of the customers were really nice.  There were a small percent of people who were jerks but nearly everyone that I waited on was nice.  There were a massive amount of Canadians there (really friendly people!) and lots of French people (really cute!) as well as lots of Brazilians (many who didn't speak English so I made due with my so-so Spanish).  I liked it when people from the UK came to my window because they always said \"cheers\" when they left which sounded cute.  A lot of people came from Australia (that's a LONG plane ride), a few came from South Africa (ditto), and one came from Senegal.  Overall, a very international crowd.Working for an hourly wage--even if it was an OK wage of $18 an hour--still made me think that I need to have my own business again.  I want to make my own hours, make my own goals, set my own rules, and make an income that can be as high as I want it to be based on the work I do.Working 40 (super busy!) hours a week reminded me that I need to be less lazy.  The job showed me that I could get a massive amount of work done if I work really hard for eight hours a day instead of getting distracted (with Reddit usually) and doing other things besides working.I was also happy with how much I learned on the job.  If you remember a while back, like the first week of the job, I was overwhelmed and ready to quit but I stuck it out and now I feel like an old pro.  I got used to the computer systems used, developed my own \"flow\" which made me work quickly and accurately, and gained a lot of confidence in an area that I knew nothing about just a couple short months ago.I got to knock \"work at the WSOP\" off of my annual goal list.I will definitely consider working there again next summer."},

(I mean is wasn't THAT long ago!).I think I only have less than a week of work left.  The tournament is winding down (or winding up, depending on how you look at it--the last week is the main event which costs $10,000 to enter so crowds will be thinning out soon).  On a bright note, Wednesday is payday again.  On a not so bright note--depending on how you look at it--I am so busy working I don't have time to go out and spend the money I am earning!I've been feeling totally out of it the past couple of days for no apparent reason.  I work in kind of a fog then come home and fall asleep at like 7pm.  Maybe I am tired (but truthfully my mind races and I consider things like a slow bleed in the brain--I whacked my head on our patio door a few days ago but I don't think it was hard enough to cause brain damage--, then I notice my fingernail beds are white white--I'm hypoxic? Carbon monoxide poisoning?  I think I watch too much House!  Maybe I am just overwhelmed with working and a house full of people).And I just started using Swype on my cell phone and love love love it.  I can produce whole words with a swish of my finger and most of them come out correctly.  How cool!That's all.  I'm going to go try to get the kids to do something that resembles play."},

{"title": "Bulking Up Our Emergency Fund", "date": "Monday, June 17, 2013", "text": "I will get my first paycheck in a few days and it will go directly into savings for our emergency fund.  Since we moved into our house, our emergency fund has hovered in the couple thousand dollar range when it should be sitting at the $10k+ range.  Without this cushion I haven't been financially comfortable because of all of the things that could happen that would create a financial disaster due to the fact that we have such an anemic emergency fund.  Among the disasters that would require more than a couple of thousand dollars to fix:Our one and only car gets wrecked (since we only carry liability on our old car, if the accident were our fault we would be minus our only car and would need more than $2000 to buy a suitable replacement).Our air conditioning system dies (we would be just fine if our heating system dies--it doesn't get that cold here and we could use space heaters--but air conditioning is A NECESSITY in Las Vegas.  And a new air conditioning unit could cost up to $5000!).One of the kids has a dire emergency (all of the kids are scattered around the US and one is in the Philippines.  If one were severely injured or had another critical emergency, getting to them, renting a car once we got there, funds to help out their family, and other travel/helping expenses would cost way more than $2000).One of us has a dire emergency (when one person in the family has a dire emergency--like being severely injured or having a severe medical crisis--the average cost of living, even though our house/car/everything else is on hand, can still grow exponentially.  Fortunately we have full coverage medical insurance but additional costs--like driving to the hospital and back daily, eating out every meal, other extras incurred when one is hovering between home and hospital--can grow exponentially and blow through a tiny emergency fund in days).The government goes over the financial cliff (because we both rely on the hubby's income and because both of his monthly checks are issued by the government--Social Security and pension--one glitch in the government's financial system could leave us without an income for a month or longer.  Thus the need for a much bigger than average emergency fund).One of us dies (knocking on wood that this doesn't happen for a very very long time...but an unexpected death has many expenses including a funeral, cremation/burial, probate costs, etc).We get divorced (ditto the knocking on wood thing but I've seen way too many people surprised by their spouse filing for divorce and neither them nor their future ex have any cash on hand and things go down hill from there.  If one or both or the parties don't want to end up homeless during this trying time, an emergency fund that is split by both is better than being penniless).A natural or man-made disaster strikes (you see all of those houses destroyed by wildfire in Colorado this week?  It made me think about what would happen if we were impacted by a similar disaster.  We would need to pay for a hotel or other place to stay, we would need to replace clothes and toiletries, etc.  Insurance would come into play eventually but the moment a disaster happens is when you need immediate cash on hand).That's all of the terrible things I can think of now but you get my point.  Without a fat and fluffy emergency fund, a major crisis can have a majorly bad impact on your life.  That's why all of my hard work is going towards bulking up our emergency fund instead of to something more fun...like shoes :)"},

Also boring: the hubby and I were discussing what I was going to do with my first big paycheck.  A shopping spree?  A cruise (I had been planning on this)?  A new smartphone for hubby (I wanted to do this too)?  And the conclusion...its's going into our emergency fund which has been nearly empty since we moved into our new house (we spent most of the money from our emergency fund when we moved into our new house on new furniture, decor, clothes hanger, pots and pans, etc. and it never really got replenished).  So instead of something fun and fancy, we will be practical and boring and get the emergency fund back up to where it should be.  Yes being frugal can be not so much fun (especially when the alternative is gleefully spending money with abandon) but having the emergency fund set will be a really positive step for our financial future."},

Yesterday went perfectly, my money balanced perfectly, and I processed hundreds and hundreds of tournament entries which made the day go by super fast.  Also, I asked the supervisor if they could just leave me in the cage (department) I am in now instead of moving me to different areas each day and she said no problem.  I am so much in the zone when I am working in this particular department that it is almost zen-like!I saw this article on car insurance which reminded me that I usually go through our bills once or twice a year to see if there are any ways to lower them.  I need to get around to doing that.We also need to go to the county tax office and get a rebate card for hubby to use on our upcoming car registration.  If you are a veteran in Las Vegas (and other cities as well) you can get a waiver on paying the annual registration fee on your car and/or property tax.Hubby has been diligently using his new treadmill for at least one hour every day.  Yeah hubby!"},

But I have half an annual list of goals that I still want to get through and almost all of them take money and we don't have a lot of extra money laying around so I wanted to do this job to make extra money to accomplish my goals and quitting would ruin this plan and plus I am a bit stubborn so I gave day three a chance.Yesterday (day 3) was sooo much better.  I knew what I was doing, there were very few things I needed to ask for help with, and while it still took two hours to count out after my shift even though I prepped everything I needed for check out so perfectly that I thought it would take minutes (which it would have but the process for checking out was so chaotic that it took ages for the clerks to figured out what was what) that I just kicked back and figured I was getting paid nearly $40 to sit there and watch the chaos.  Plus I balanced perfectly.Today is day 4 which I should have been working but another girl said she needed as many hours as she could get because she had a car payment due, etc so I told her she could have my shift today and I am going to just stay home and chill (plus I have been getting overtime every day since I started so I will still end up with the same out of money in this paycheck that I anticipated).  Then it is back to work tomorrow.Here's some things I have learned:All new jobs are overwhelming on the first day, so even if you are tempted to quit, you should at least give the new job a week or two to determine if it really is an awful job or if you are just feeling overwhelmed and frustrated.EVERYONE should have ZERO debt.  It is much more fun to go to work (or even quit a job you don't like) when you don't have bill collectors breathing down you neck.Being responsible for so much money is a high stress job.  I thought that dealing poker would be really stressful but now I think cashiering is more so.  Maybe I should be a dealer next year?Develop processes ASAP when you get to a new job.  We got a bit of basic training and were told that accurate counting was the most important thing to remember but I am sure everyone interprets that differently.  In my case, I quickly put together a 1, 2, 3, step process for taking money, printing out seat tickets, and giving change back that is the same every time so it is less likely I would get confused and mess up my money.If you are going to come to a big money-spending event (like the WSOP or even going on a family vacation), save money and put it aside specifically for the event.  It's one thing to blow through savings set aside for the poker tournament (some events are $125 each, others are $2500 each), it's another thing to cash your paycheck and hope you can squeeze out enough leftover money after the event to pay your house payment (a couple of my customers seemed to hint that that was the case).Be nice to people.  It is easy to take out your frustrations on your coworkers, customers, bosses, etc. when things aren't going well but if you tell yourself that you are going to be happy and pleasant no matter what, you won't do or say something you will regret and you will be remembered for being a nice person (I still go to the store where I worked last Christmas and everyone remembers me and they are very nice each time I come in even though I was tempted to ask a couple of them what prison they had been released from because their people skills were truly terrible...but I just forced myself to be nice and kind whether I thought they deserved it or not and everything worked out well in the end). My goal for June: keep this job so I can take hubby on a cruise in the fall (my new mantra)."},

I can't believe how much people spend on poker!  If hubby pulled out thousands and thousands of dollars and dropped it on the cashiers table to get into a poker game I would probably faint but these guys act like thousands of dollars isn't, well, thousands of dollars."},

{"title": "The Things I Do In the Name of Frugality", "date": "Monday, May 20, 2013", "text": "So the bees are still there.  I called the county extension office, Googled, and posted on a local blog about the problem and got the same answer--either they will be gone in a few days or we will need to call a bee removal service.  I will give them until tomorrow to relocate (which would save me a ton of money) or I will call a service to get rid of them (definitely won't help our financial situation).  Unfortunately it doesn't seem like there are any beekeepers who will come and get them like they do in other areas.  Fortunately they are over on the side of the house where they aren't bothering anyone.  Hubby wanted to blast them with the hose but I nixed that idea--he's 64 years old and not nearly as fast as he thinks he is (as in, there is no way he can outrun a swarm of angry bees).  So we wait and hope for a frugal outcome.And then I needed a haircut.  Hubby likes my hair now that it is growing out but it is becoming a bit shaggy.  I really didn't want to go pay $15 for a trim of like 1/4 inch so I finally talked hubby into trying his hand at cutting my hair (he is all for frugality, not much for being a hair dresser).  My hair is hard to work with anyway since it is not straight--in fact it is really curly and most of the time I get a so-so haircut even at a salon.  So hubby went to work on my hair, I cringed a bit because it didn't \"feel\" like it does when a professional is cutting it, but overall I think it was kind of OK.  Of the past three haircuts, one was by hubby, the one previous to that ended up being a mullet, and for the one before that, the girl used a razor on the back which really made my hair unhappy.  Here's a picture which is kind of hard to see (note this was after the cut and after a wash and after I took a nap on it!) but with a bit of styling it may last for another month or so before I hit up a real salon."},

{"title": "A Commencement Speech for Graduation", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2013", "text": "The year is racing by so imagine my surprise when I found out it was nearly graduation time for kids in high school and college!  Then I read this and thought 'that's the best graduation speech I've ever heard' (minus the F-bombs in every single sentence).  But the message is true.  And then I thought about what kind of speech I would give (no one has ever asked me to give a commencement speech and probably never will but I digress...) and came up with the following items that I would tell kids just starting out (heavy on the frugal stuff, light on the philosophy):First, I would address kids each year, beginning in ninth grade (by the time kids get to the commencement address at the end of college they have already missed way too many lessons that should have been learned earlier).For high school kids I would tell them: try all kinds of hobbies and experiences, challenge yourself but in a good way (backpack for a month during summer break, don't, for example, see how many tattoos you and your friends can accumulate), join organizations (yes, I know that Boy Scouts, for example, often equates with nerdiness but when you look at the most successful adults, many were in scouting where they learned tons of useful skills that then served them well throughout their lives), don't lock yourself into one social group and be yourself (it really really really won't matter in the grand scheme of your life that the cool kids thought you were so uncool at school or the flip side, it won't matter that you were the coolest kid in high school after you get out of high school).If your high school is going to pay for your advanced education for free, by all means TAKE IT!  Some schools offer a joint high school/community college program that high school kids can do for free thus saving two years of college tuition, other high schools offer beauty school so that students can get licenses as a hair stylist/barber upon completion, and other schools offer welding classes/computer game design/etc (basically if you can learn a marketable skill for free in high school that will help you get a job even though it isn't what you want to do for the rest of your life, take it!  A lot of kids graduate from high school with exactly zero marketable skills which is very sad).Work during high school and college (you don't have to work full time as even a part time job will teach you job skills, give you something to put on your resume, connect you to the world of work, and garner you some business references).Don't get a tattoo during high school or college (a very unpopular sentiment I know but getting all tattooed up when you are young is like picking out a shirt to wear at 18 that you will wear the rest of your life.  Ick). Take it easy on the drugs and alcohol.  Peer pressure is stupid and so is ruining your life with one drunken/drugged up night during your teenage years (I've met a half dozen teenagers who got drunk, decided to drive,  killed someone, and ended up in prison instead of making it to graduation; this affects them for the rest of their lives and is so preventable).Be self employed.  When you have a few job skills down, take a stab (or two or three or four) at self-employment.  There is nothing better than being able to generate income without the blessing of a boss/corporation/manager/etc.Keep a tight rein on your money.  Don't fall for credit card offers (if you don't have cash to pay for something, you don't need it), save a little of each paycheck for when you are old (yes, you will be old one day and it is best not to be old and penniless), don't loan money to friends, never co-sign for anyone, don't do anything that requires \"small monthly payments\" (which means pay cash for a car, use the gym at school instead of signing up for a two year gym contract, etc).Don't give into the pressure to go to college if you aren't really the college type.  There are plenty of plumbers/car repair people/etc that make a good living without having gone to college.Don't take out loans for college.  Either get a boatload of scholarships or slow down and pay as you go at the cheapest state school possible.  It is just stupid for kids to be saddled with $800 per month student loan payments for years and years after graduation just because they thought--for four years--that all of the money coming to them was free.Make sure the degree you are working towards will translate into a job at graduation (I've lost track of how many people have graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology only to realize that you can't be a psychologist without many more years of school and a PhD.  Duh).  Don't even get me started on the usefulness of a degree in philosophy...When you are lonely, turn to a friend or family.  Don't turn to a serious boyfriend/girlfriend or decide to have a baby because your life feels incomplete   Growing pains are natural, and turning over your life before you are even in your 20s to a baby or a SO doesn't bode well for your future.Take care of your health.  At this point you take your teeth/hearing/health for granted.  Years from now you will be happy that you have your teeth/hearing/health when many others are struggling because they overlooked this rule.Go forth and be awesome at whatever you do.  You don't need anyone's permission to be passionate about writing or collecting Star Trek figures, for example.  Be unique, do the things you love, be kind to everyone, help others because you never know when you will need help, be honest and ethical so you will have fewer things coming back to haunt you, don't worry about things (if things happened in the past, know you can't change them; for things that are happening now, handle them instead of worrying; for things that might happen in the future, don't worry.  Make the best decision you can and realize that you will end up where you are supposed to end up).Happy graduation!"},
{"title": "11 Money and Time Saving Conference Tips", "date": "Wednesday, May 15, 2013", "text": "I had a great time volunteering at the National Genealogical Society conference here in Vegas last week.  There were so many times I wanted to tell people \"you know you could save money if...\" but I restrained myself.  So I'll share these tips with you!Register early.  Most conferences offer a discount on the registration fee if you register before a certain date.Dress in layers.  Many conference spaces have uneven heating and cooling which means you may be roasting in one room and freezing in another, so bring a light jacket even if it is the middle of summer.  This will save you the expense of running to the hotel gift shop or vendor hall and buying a sweatshirt for no other reason than that you are freezing cold and your jacket is across town in your hotel.Bring your own water/coffee and snacks.  Most conference facilities have vending areas (or a Starbucks or other restaurants) but the prices are usually double or triple what you would pay at a grocery store.Bring lunch.  Again, you can save money by bringing your own food for lunch.  Many conferences have luncheons but you pay extra for this and while organized luncheons are great for networking and maybe catching an additional conference topic, the cost is usually double or triple what it would cost you to bring your own lunch from home or the grocery store.Be careful with add-ons.  In addition to the usual 9-5 conference classes, many conferences add additional classes/mixers/dinners/tours/etc. which you will pay extra for.  Again, while these are great for networking and/or getting a package-like tour of the area, the costs are usually quite high for the convenience.Wear comfortable shoes.  Conference facilities can be huge so you can put many miles per day on your feet which is easier to do in tennis shoes than in spike heels (which could result in the need to run to the hotel gift shop to buy some over-priced flip flops for your aching feet).Don't go crazy in the vendor area.  Most conferences include a vendor area/exhibit hall with lots of cool things for sale.  This is great for picking up hard to find items but the sheer amount of things offered for sale can make you spend like crazy.Consider public transportation.  I was amazed at the number of people who arrived at the conference in cabs while there was a perfectly good bus as well as a monorail that came straight to the conference facility.  Before you go with an obvious mode of transportation (cab, rental car), check out local public transit options as well as ride-sharing opportunities with other conference attendees.You don't necessarily have to stay at the hotel where the conference is being held. While doing so is very convenient, by doing a bit of research to see if it would be more cost efficient to stay at a hotel a little ways away from the conference and getting a multi-day public transit pass, you may save a lot of money (and don't forget checking prices at nearby AirBnBs as well!).Do your homework before you arrive.  A few people asked me \"what is there to do in Las Vegas\" and I looked at them like  o_0?  A bit of research before they left home would have not only informed them of the great public transportation system in Vegas ($7.50 for a 24-hour public transit pass), but tons of nearby free activities (walking the Strip, enjoying Fremont in the evening, free circus shows just down the street, etc).Look for other ways to save money based on the venue (ie: the hotel charged for wi-fi access but there was a free wi fi area set up in the conference area, one lady bought a bunch of K-cups from home because she asked what kind of coffee maker was in the room--and found that those expensive little coffee cuplets were not provided free at the hotel, the library was just a bus ride away and offered free temporary library cards for visitors and thus all the free books and movies you could want during your stay, etc)."},

{"title": "Ten Money-Saving Things I Did This Week", "date": "Thursday, May 9, 2013", "text": "Taking a bit of a break from the conference.  Here's ten great ways we saved money this week:I volunteered at the genealogy conference which got me free entry into the conference (others paid up to $265 to attend).  While I don't get to go to every talk, I do get to sit in on some of the classes and they have been very educational and enlightening.I checked out r/frugal on reddit and came across this useful (and money saving!) list.The SIL wanted to see a Vegas show so the hubby used FillASeat and they are right now, as I type this, at a comedy show (for free!).The SIL also wanted to go to LA for a couple of days so I started out with free resources to get her there (some of the cousins were heading over but their car was full), so, moving on, I went to the next cheapest option which was Megabus ($20 each way) and a $5 day pass for the bus.  She had a wonderful trip!We have more people to feed with our guests here this week so we are cooking at home and cooking frugally (bought meat on sale as loss leaders and bought lots of pasta and vegetables from the 99 cent store).We also need to entertain our guests which we are doing for free or frugally as well (hubby has a free pass for Red Rock Canyon, there is a free Elvis contest going on in Fremont this weekend which we will watch, and there are also dozens of free events going on around Vegas this weekend).We are repurposing.  With the BIL staying for three months, we were all set with his room but then found that he will need some sort of shelving for his clothes.  In my old life, I would have ran to Walmart and bought a brand new shelving unit but we looked in the garage and found that we didn't need all of the plastic shelving that was basically holding junk so the hubby cleaned up the shelves and the BIL now has a nice place to put his clothes in his closet.Being thankful is free.  With so much horrible news this week (the women who were held captive for over a decade, the people who went overboard on the cruise ship in Australia, etc) I am just thankful for my very good, very happy life.We are coordinating rides.  The BIL has his own car which he uses to go to work but that leaves the hubby, the SIL, and me to share one car (we don't have public transportation in our area).  We are easily combining our trips and organizing our day so everyone gets to where they want to go, all with one car.I resisted my bad habit.  The minute I hit the conference facility, I have the automatic feeling that I need to Starbucks each morning (a holdover from my previous life when picking up a Starbucks on the way to a meeting or conference was de rigour).  So instead of picking up Starbucks, I sign in and get busy working and try to ignore the nagging voice in my heading telling me I need to go buy an expensive beverage to start my day.  This has saved me $20 so far!"},

{"title": "Home Repairs: A Quick Money and Time-Saving Tip", "date": "Saturday, May 4, 2013", "text": "Our house is now sparkly clean and ready for guests.  Starting next week we will have one SIL here for a week then the BIL will be here for three months, and in June, another SIL will bring her grandkids and stay for a month.  Needless to say our house is going to be crazy busy.  To get ready for everyone's arrival we did a couple of updates that we felt were important (replace the leaky kitchen faucet and install shower doors in two bathrooms, getting rid of the icky shower curtains) as well as scrubbed everything clean and made sure the guest rooms were neat and tidy.  So I think we are now ready for the onslaught.  Yesterday as we finished installing the second shower door we realized one very important thing about doing home improvement projects:  if possible, do the upgrades in multiples.  Here's some examples:When we bought our house, all of the smoke alarms were missing so we went to the home store and bought five of the exact same smoke alarms to install.  This saved money because we were able to buy a contractor pack of five which was cheaper than buying them individually.  After we moved into our house we realized that all of the bedrooms really needed ceiling fans.  We bought three identical fans then set to work installing them.  The first one took a while to figure out.  The second one was easier to install.  By the third one, we could have installed it blindfolded.A while back, I noticed that the on-off valve in my shower was dripping.  We replaced it (a traumatic event related somewhere in this blog...sorry couldn't find it to link to it) but we didn't replace the on-off valve in the other shower which we should have done because now it has a slow drip.  Following the rule of 'always do things in multiples if possible' we would have saved time (after the first one, the second one is easier because you already know what you are doing) and effort (we already had the tools and after two trips to the home store, finally got the correct replacement cartridge).  So....lesson learned there.  Finally, we installed two shower doors in the bathrooms over the past few days.  The first door install four hours over two days and was a pain in the a**.  We installed the bottom sill then screwed in the side frame pieces then noticed that the side frame was too tall to hold the doors correctly so had to unscrew the side frame pieces and cut them to size and somewhere in there had to stop and run to the home store to get a better hacksaw blade and...well there was a lot of confusion (plus we had already caulked the side frame pieces in place then had to remove them and the caulk DID NOT WANT TO LET GO).  Ayayay  we should have made a YouTube video.  Then we installed the second shower door which took a grand total one one hour since we had already figured out what to do and how to do it well and quickly.  There was also a screw missing in the little parts set that came with the first door so we simply borrowed the needed piece from the second door set which was good because we didn't have to stop mid-project and run to the store for the missing piece (later we picked up the needed screw but at least we didn't have to stop--yet again--when working on the first door).Bottom line: it pays to do repair/upgrade things in multiples to save both time and money (and your sanity!)."},

(done. also fun!)Do three volksmarches.Work on my RITA manuscript.Wow it has been a super busy week.  Here's the highlights:I wanted to get some new nail polish since I have had exactly one bottle/color for the past two years.  At Target, one bottle of my second favorite polish (Revlon; OPI is my favorite but it is expensive) cost $3.99 so I went next door to Ross and got four bottles for $6.99.  And with the white polish that came in the set, I used it to write the letters on my laptop keyboard that had been obliterated by my typing!I met the nicest lady who came down from Seattle.  She emailed our volksmarch club to see if anyone wanted to walk with her so I volunteered and we went on one walk (with the second walk I had to have hubby drop her off and pick her up because I had to go to my job interview).  Anyway, she had lived in India and traveled all over the world and was just fascinating to talk to!We will be having a lot of guests in the next couple of months so we repaired the leaky kitchen faucet (replaced it with a cheap faucet from Walmart instead of the $90 faucet I wanted because an expensive faucet just wasn't in the budget this month.  At least it doesn't leak!).  We also bought two shower doors and are installing them today and tomorrow.  What a pain--hubby and I should put all of this on YouTube because it never works out as simply and easily as it does on TV :IWe crammed in four FillASeat shows this past week because we hadn't went to any all month.  The first was a comedian who was OK (hubby was so tired after getting back from Seattle he was nodding off at the show!), the second was a comedian/impressionist.  I didn't think he was that great--he was OK and playing at a very small venue with a very small audience--but you have to admire anyone who has the courage to get up in front of an audience and try to be funny (a very subjective thing to do).  Next we went to see Recycled Percussion (taking a cue from Dar I brought along my earplugs and I was SO GLAD I DID!).  The show was creative and fun but about 200 decibels too loud for my taste.  Finally we went to see Pin Up which was really good--no one told us it was media night so we basically showed up at a red carpet event in jeans--but the show was wonderful, the band was excellent, the choreography was amazing, the dancers were really skillful, the crowd was cheering...overall a great show!And other good things: I got two very cute outfits at the Goodwill for a total of $10 today, one of the cousins gave us a suite at the Rio for two nights and three days which we enjoyed last weekend, we met up with another friend who came down from Seattle for a few days, I'm excited to get to volunteer at the National Genealogical Society conference which will be here in Vegas next week, and I sent in my supplemental hiring questions for the very good job and (kind of) have my fingers crossed that I will move further along in the hiring process!"},
{"title": "I've Got a Job(s?)!", "date": "Sunday, April 28, 2013", "text": "Sometime at the end of last year, when I was writing up my goals for 2013, I decided that I wanted to work at the World Series of Poker (don't ask me why...maybe I was subconsciously thinking that I needed some way to fund my other goals).  A couple of months ago I decided to apply then promptly thought that I had chosen a bad goal because what if they didn't hire me?  Then I got a notice telling me to come in and audition for the job I applied for (the email said if I couldn't make it there would be no rescheduling but a nice lady called and I told her I would be out of town so she did, in fact, allow me to reschedule). Fast forward to yesterday when I went in with about 50 other hopeful candidates.  After one basic math test (I passed...I was worried because I hadn't taken a math test in decades but I passed!), a bit of training with counting casino chips, and an audition where I was also able to count chips and money accurately (some people didn't get hired because you got one chance to count out chips and money and if you made a mistake you were finished), I got hired!  I was so excited!  So not only will this knock another goal off my list but the terms were better than I had expected ($14 an hour, paid lunch, actually the lunch hour is paid and they give you a free buffet for lunch any time you work, plus a $1500 bonus at the end of the six weeks if you stay the entire time) and it looks like people will be getting a lot of hours.  PLUS it will get me out of the house (some of hubby's family members will be coming to stay with us for the duration of the tournament because they will be playing in it so we should have a full house for about six weeks.  It's going to be craziness but I won't be there because I will be working...yeah!).Then I got an email about another job.  You may have remembered a while back when I found a job that was very similar to what I had done in the past.  I wasn't going to apply but instead ask that they contract with me but I looked at the online application and it wasn't so onerous so I did the short, one-page application, and a couple of days ago they emailed and said that I passed the first review and sent me a bunch of questions for the next part of the hiring process (questions about the work I had done in this field, etc).  So I need to get those submitted soon.  This job would be much better than the other (according to others...for me I'm not so sure since it would be a permanent, full time, $90k/year, \"career\" kind of job and it just seems like such a \"golden handcuffs\" trap...yikes!).  So now I will just wait and see what happens with both jobs.  I think this will be a great way to spend the summer, plus, since we won't be going anywhere for over a month, I may do my \"go to yoga class every day for a month\" goal as well!"},

{"title": "Our Trip By the Numbers", "date": "Wednesday, April 24, 2013", "text": "We got back last night from a wonderful vacation to the Pacific Northwest.  It was SO beautiful and green there.  Loved it!!  Here's our trip by the numbers (all costs are for two people):Total trip was 10 nights, 11 days.  We went to Portland, Vancouver, Seattle, Silverdale/Poulsbo, Pt Angeles, and Victoria BC.We spent two nights in a hotel in Victoria ($121.72) and the other eight nights at the homes of friends and family.Transportation costs were: flying from Las Vegas to Portland ($179.80), taking Amtrak from Vancouver to Seattle ($54.00), and flying back from Seattle to Las Vegas ($241.60).  Fortunately the hubby's cousin loaned us one of his cars so we only used public transportation in Victoria but otherwise had a free car to use for most of our vacation.We spent approximately $500 in spending money (everything from ferry fees to meals out to gas to buying a few things at the Goodwill, to snacks, day passes for the bus, etc).  I should have kept better records!We saved money by: having free places to stay, not doing any tourist activities that required a fee (meeting up with friends was fun and a few took us out to eat, walking around the parks/waterfront areas, etc), parking in Pt Angeles (cost $18) instead of taking the car with us on the ferry (cost would have been $58 EACH WAY to do so; public transportation in Victoria was about $5 per person per day), eating out at inexpensive places when necessary.We could have saved more money if: I would have liked Filipino food (it was like a gourmet restaurant at the cousin's house because their in-laws were also staying there and they formerly owned a restaurant in the Philippines and needless to say they were excellent cooks, unfortunately I don't like Filipino food so I usually picked up fast food to eat--not healthy and not cost-effective), we took the absolute cheapest flights to and from the Pacific Northwest (we paid a bit more for Delta Airlines in order to get air miles and also to reduce the return flight from nine hours (!) to four hours, we didn't eat out as much (we hit a few nice restaurants and technically could have bought food and cooked it but eating out is part of traveling for us).And some other nifty tricks: we shut off our phones in BC so we didn't get charged for international roaming so when we weren't together we had to set times and locations to meet up; for my birthday my SIL said \"go out to a nice meal on me\" but instead of spending $100+ on just the two of us at a fancy place, we used the money to take us and the four cousins out to a nice buffet place (Kings Wok in Silverdale which was awesome) which I thought was an excellent use of the money; I bought a great pair of jeans for $1.29 at the Goodwill in Silverdale (I just can't seem to pass up a thrift store these days), we only bring two carry-on bags each and never check luggage with the airlines (saves on the fees).Overall we had a wonderful trip.  Now I am looking forward to our next adventure which will be either to San Francisco, Chicago, or New Orleans (I think we will postpone the cruise to the fall because it looks like I may have an eight-week temporary job at the end of May)."},
{"title": "One Marathon. Done.", "date": "Monday, April 22, 2013", "text": "I've crossed another goal off of my annual goal list: complete a marathon.  Which I did this past Saturday.  My feet still hurt.  Here's what we did:We skipped the trip to the San Juans, unfortunately.  It was storming the night before we left and we figured that if for some reason the ferries to the east side of the sound and the ferry through the San Juans got delayed due to the weather there would be no way to make it to the marathon.So we hopped the ferry from Port Angeles to Victoria BC the next morning and the weather turned out to be nice as soon as we got to the BC side of the water.I did complete the marathon (see certificate above).  Note that I am the slowest walker I know and it took nearly nine hours of walking to complete (needless to say my feet and still unhappy).  Of course the fact that I would walk ten paces then find something interesting to take a picture of didn't help (see photos here and here).Canadians are the nicest people on the planet!  They are so friendly and helpful (nearly a half dozen times people stopped to ask if I was lost or needed help during the walk since I was looking around for the trail markers and, well, I probably did look lost.  One guy went zipping by me on a bike, stopped, turned around, and came back to ask if I was looking for something.  Amazing!).  Also, if you are anywhere in the vicinity of a crosswalk, they stop and wait patiently while you cross the street (in Las Vegas, unless it is a certainty that you will cause damage to their car, people don't stop at crosswalks).  tl;dr: if it wasn't freezing cold in Canada, I would move there!The weather was great for a walk.  It was sunny and warm most of the way with a light breeze--perfect for walking.There is A LOT of nature in Victoria BC!  We walked 12+ miles out from Victoria and found ourselves in the wilderness.  We walked the Lochshead Trail, around two lakes, and hit all kinds of other trails through forests and along waterways.  Beautiful!Canadians also sound nice (I like their accents!) and look nice (or maybe everyone I saw on the trial looked nice because they get out in nature often.  Maybe socialized health care?  Whatever it is, they look much healthier than Americans).We had donairs twice (something we don't often find in the US) but I couldn't find poutine anywhere (it looked tasty on a Food Network Canada TV show we watched).Bus service around the island was excellent, with a $5 pass, we could get on and off buses all day as we checked out various parts of the city.I was a little leery about the hotel we reserved (Travelodge in Esquimalt) because it was a cheap rate where you pay first then find out the name of the hotel but I thought that since it was a two-star hotel with hundreds of four-star ratings, it might be OK.  And it was.  It was clean and quiet and well cared for and located perfectly for us.  We were super happy with the hotel!This was a smaller walk festival than I have been to in the past with only about 20 people completing the marathon and lots of people doing shorter walks and while I walked by myself much of the way, I did walk about 10k with a lady who was preparing for a May trip to Spain to do the 800k Camino de Santiago walk.  You meet the most interesting people volksmarching!Overall it was a wonderful trip, I got to knock off another goal (although \"do a marathon\" may never again end up on my goals lists!), and I am already planning to come back up to the Pacific Northwest next summer to attend a week-long volksmarch festival in the Columbia River Gorge (where I will do daily 10k walks instead of one long--and painful--42k walk!)."},
{"title": "Yet Another Update", "date": "Thursday, April 18, 2013", "text": "Here's a quick update before we head off to Canada at zero dark 30 tomorrow morning:Yesterday was my birthday!  I celebrated by walking a 10k volksmarch :)Tomorrow we will combine the Victoria BC trip and San Juans trip by going through the San Juans via ferry to get to Victoria then spending a bit more time in the San Juan Islands on the way back (the only drawback is that there is exactly one ferry per day going to Vancouver Island and it is at 8:30am and we are 2.5 hours away from said ferry so we need to leave super early to make it on time).Right now I am in my favorite Silverdale Cafe (Cafe Noir) updating all of my blogs and websites.  The cousin's house we are staying at has a frustratingly slow and mostly unusable connection.  The wifi at the cafe is blazing fast PLUS I get to enjoy a nice hot chocolate while I type :)I told hubby that we need a summer house here in the Puget Sound area.  He said he would die of boredom within a week.  Nature is NOT boring....at least to me.The Saturday marathon looks like it will be long (about eight hours of walking) and wet (supposed to be a downpour starting tonight and running through the weekend.  Eeekkk).Also staying at the cousin's house are another set of cousins who just moved here from the Philippines.  The husband headed out this morning pushing a lawn mower.  I asked the cousin if he had ever used a lawn mower and she said no but he would figure it out (double eekkk.  Fortunately the grass was too wet to mow. Plus, as happens to EVERYONE who comes here from the Philippines, they are freezing and wearing three or four layers of clothing until they get acclimated).Hubby misses Vegas.  Everything shuts down here at 9pm (and I mean EVERYTHING...shops, restaurants, etc) BUT the people in these small towns are SO nice and polite (a nice change from people in Vegas who would rather run you over than slow down for you at a cross walk).Finally, I love all of the greenness and beautiful views to be found here on the Kitsap Peninsula!Wish me luck on the marathon!"},
{"title": "An Early Week Update", "date": "Monday, April 15, 2013", "text": "Updating from beautiful Seattle:Obviously the most important news of the day was the tragedy that happened this morning at the Boston Marathon.  When the news first broke, I was really, really hoping that it was a gas main explosion or something.  After I met with some dear Muslim friends today that I haven't seen in a couple of years, I am now really, really hoping it wasn't a Muslim who committed such a horrible crime (as are they which they said repeatedly.  They are tired of being equated with extremists which they said reflects badly on their religion and makes them a target for hate when they are the nicest people you could ever meet).  My prayers go out to everyone involved in this incident.Things have been going great so far...the flight was wonderful, the reunion went better than expected (in a family full of drama, the event was surprisingly drama-free), the weather has been great (colder than we are used to but sunny and nice), the train ride to Seattle was fun (hubby had not been on a train in nearly 50 years and thought it was wonderful), catching up with friends is awesome, and to top it off, we went to the Eddie Bauer outlet today and I got a cute backpack for my walk which was half off then we went to the Goodwill and I found a great pair of perfectly broken-in jeans for $1.29!I realize that I really miss Seattle...the land of North Face jackets, sensible shoes, backpacks which are a fashion statement, coffee, and books...lots of books.  When I make my fortune as a writer, I am buying my second home here in Seattle (a surprising number of famous writers do this--they keep a house in warmer climes so they can escape the cold, rainy winters of Seattle but also have a house in the beautiful Pacific Northwest).That's all so far...I am psyching myself up for the marathon on Saturday (then the half marathon on Sunday which I am not at all sure I will be able to do after walking 26 miles the previous day!)."},

{"title": "My Goals are Practically on Auto Pilot!", "date": "Thursday, April 11, 2013", "text": "I will knock off two goals next week, the family reunion which started out as a whim between me and an aunt over email (\"hey, we haven't got together in years, wouldn't it be nice to all get together for a dinner or something\") and walking a marathon (I've been practicing a little, I really hope I make it!).One of my other goals was \"work at the WSOP\" (the World Series of Poker is a six-week poker tournament here in Vegas for which they hire loads of people to fill temporary positions for the tournament).  Since I hadn't heard back from them I figured that goal would just be a fail.  Then I got an email two days ago that said come audition for a cashier position this Saturday, no rescheduling possible, one day only.  So of course I was bummed because I won't be in town, then the next day I got a phone call asking if I was going to make it to the audition and I launched into a spiel about how sorry I was but that I would be out of town but I really really wanted to work for the WSOP so they told me to come in the Saturday after I get back and they would let me audition then!  So much for one day only.  Needless to say, this goal may actually work out!  If I do get the job, I will use the money I earn to pay for the bike trip so instead of biking from Canada to Mexico in May (with little to no funds for the trip), I will do the trip in August after the tournament is over with a fat and fluffy bank account! The strange thing about writing your goals down is that even without maximum effort (or the money to even accomplish them) sometimes the universe comes together and makes you achieve the goals you set with very little effort (or money!).p.s. \"Auditioning\" is kind of like interviewing for a job; they show you what they want done (counting chips, dealing poker, etc) and you do what they have shown you.  I am thinking as long as I can count and not spill chips everywhere I should be able to get the job!  Also, I applied for a cashier job not a dealer job.  The pay is about the same but people aren't mean to you when they loose like they are to the dealers."},
{"title": "10 Sources of Retirement Income", "date": "Tuesday, April 9, 2013", "text": "People always ask how we are able to retire at such young ages.  Besides the fact that looking at us can be a bit misleading (hubby is 64 yet looks 44 and I am 45 and look...well, 45), the simple answer is that we live frugally on a fixed income.  The income part, however, is usually what people are wondering about when they talk about retiring so here are ten sources of retirement income that you can acquire at just about any age and then, if you choose, promptly retire!Social security.  Obviously you aren't going to retire early if you are waiting for social security.  In order to draw social security you need to be at least 62 years old and I bet that this minimum age will increase in the future (if it is even still there to draw from because mathematically the formula for this program worked great when the Baby Boomers were working industriously to fill the coffers; I doubt that the formula is going to work very well when the mass of Baby Boomers start drawing from this program while the mass of younger people are unemployed/underemployed and thus unable to keep this program propped up financially).  Also, the amount of social security you can draw is based on your previous income so you can do OK on only Social Security if you made a lot of money throughout your earning years AND have mastered the art of living very frugally (along with having some assets).  If you have always earned minimum wage, your social security income is going to be quite meager and probably won't support you no matter how frugally you live.A pension.  Pension programs are a boon for retirees.  Generally the combination of a pension and social security has allowed many people to retire rather well.  Hubby began drawing his military pension at 40 years old after serving for 22 years in the Navy.  While this isn't a huge amount of money, having a pension coming in every month beginning at 40 years of age is a very nice additional source of income.  A caveat about pensions: depending on what type of pension you have, it could just disappear due to financial mismanagement or other market factors (the government pension will probably be the last to implode while many private pension plans are teetering on the brink as we speak).Investments.  Oh how I wish that I had bought Microsoft stock way back in the mid 1980s.  I would be retired and living off my stock investments, but alas, I didn't.  Bummer.  However many retirees have made investments over the course of their lives and are living on the proceeds from these, whether they invested in IRAs and 401ks, bought rental properties, or bought stocks and CDs, etc.  Investments generally need time to grow over time before they start paying off and often the aforementioned investments still require a bit of work whether it is doing upkeep on rental properties, reinvesting dividends, etc. Royalties.  I am learning that royalties are the gift that keeps on giving.  Simply, you do a bit of work (write a book, publish a song, make an app, appear in a TV show, etc), from then on, if you have contracted correctly, you get a bit of income every time your book is sold, your TV show is syndicated, your song is sung on the radio, etc.Rental income.  Unlike owning investment properties, above, some people find a source of income (and sometimes companionship) by renting out rooms in their home.  After the kids have moved out and a spouse has passed away, the person may be left with a big house and many house-related bills. One way to generate some income from this big house is to rent out rooms either to long-term renters like college students or someone looking for a kind-of permanent place to live or through AirBNB for short-time room rentals.  I've also known people who rented out their garages for storage, their fields to other farmers, their land for parking if the state fair is held near by, etc.Savings.  Oh how I wish I would have put at least a little of my earnings throughout the years into a savings account.  But I didn't.  Bummer.  There are some people, however, that are really good about saving, either through a small effort made monthly over years or via a concerted effort to get gazelle-intense and build up a savings account quickly and then using either the savings or the interest on the savings as a source of monthly income.  Obviously living off the interest is better than drawing down the principle of your savings account each month.Hobbies.  Another popular source of retirement income is to turn hobbies into small money-making ventures.  This rarely equates to what you could earn with a full-time job but even a few hundred dollars a month garnered from trash picking and reselling items or quilting and selling your creations or baking specialties from your home country and selling them to others for parties, etc. can generate a small amount of extra income that can help you pay your living expenses or pay for extras like travel or eating out.Temporary jobs.  I know quite a few people who have no real \"job\", who tend to travel quite a bit or otherwise live lives with no obvious source of a steady income, yet get by just fine.  They do this by picking up temporary or seasonal jobs to make a bit of extra money.  My grandmother did this decades ago.  She worked full time through the war (this was WWII for those who wonder what war I am talking about) then after the war she promptly quit (\"because I didn't feel like working any more\").  Of course she liked working, she just didn't like official 9 to 5 jobs so she would pick up whatever interesting work she came across.  Among her temporary jobs: growing and selling produce at a roadside stand (my grandparent had u-pick strawberries and grapes for years), working at each election, house sitting for a wealthy couple in Santa Barbara when they went to Europe each summer, babysitting occasionally for a neighbor couple when they wanted a date night, doing seasonal work at a fisheries plant (which probably is why she never ate smelt...after cleaning a million of them, I wouldn't want to look at another smelt either!)...etc.  These are things she did as a widow but before my grandfather passed away they both had \"itinerant\" job histories and did everything from welding projects (granddad), running a Saturday-night dance hall (both), picking up guitar-playing gigs (granddad), horse training (granddad), and sewing (grandma when the Jantzen Mills needed extra help).Selling an asset.  Obviously the bigger the asset, the more money you will have to fund your retirement.  When people want to retire they often sell houses, cars, businesses, baseball card collections, etc. and use the lump sum to bulk up their savings, pay for a smaller house to live in, or fund their retirement travels.Barter and trade.  An often forgotten way to help fund your retirement is to barter or trade for the things you need in order to stay retired.  I had an uncle who retired to Solvang years ago.  He traded his services as a gardener and handyman for free rent on a guest cottage and lived there for years.  He got to surf every day and do gardening, things he wanted to do in retirement anyway, but which, due to his bartering skills, also got him a free place to live.  Retires often barter for food (I'll fix your car for a side of beef in the fall), services (I'll babysit your kids after school if you reroof my house), and other goods (I'll trade you these water skis I no longer use for your old lawnmower).  You get the idea...   And then there are sources of retirement income that you can't really count on, but, nonetheless, can and do provide income for some retirees including: inheritances (from aging parents and relatives), reverse equity mortgages (these are fraught with complications so be very aware of what you are doing with these), life insurance payouts (from the death of a spouse), winning the lotto (uh, good luck with this one), etc.And one other thing about retirement: you MUST be debt-free before you retire.  It is SO much easier to cover your basic living expenses on a fixed retirement income than it is to pay all of your bills each month PLUS pay on a variety of debts (credit cards, student loans, bank loans, second mortgages, etc)."},
{"title": "Moving Right Along...", "date": "Monday, April 8, 2013", "text": "We will be leaving by the end of the week and everything seems to be in full swing right now...The genealogy presentation is almost done with both a big descendant chart from the husband and wife that spawned this side of the family and a big ancestor chart listing ten generations (incomplete unfortunately) back from this couple.  Fortunately a great aunt has done a lot of info gathering on all of the living relatives (and gave me some pointers and what to list/what not to list like a cousin who died in a shootout with police--I'd never heard that story--but she said just to put the year he died and leave it at that).  The last thing I want is drama at this reunion and after sorting through all of the living relatives I think it may be best to start genealogy documentation with the last generation that is completely deceased.  Just a thought...Hubby has started packing now, five days in advanced, because it takes him that long to pack (you should see his closet, it's like ten times bigger, and fuller, than mine!  I can pack in about ten minutes.Hubby was nice enough to do a volksmarch with me today.  I want to do one 10k walk a day up until the marathon just to get in shape.  Hubby said no more volksmarching for him--six miles is just too much for his crunchy back and legs.I'm not knocking goals off my monthly goal list as quickly as I'd like, mostly because all require money and we are trying not to spend any money this month until after we see how much we spend on the trip.I LOVE our library.  I was bored a couple of days ago and so I went onto the library website and picked a few ebooks I wanted to read and--surprise--there was no waiting list for the books as there has always been in the past so I was able to immediately download the books to the Kindle app on my computer.  That rocks!I also LOVE reddit.  Case in point, one of my websites had some messed up code that I couldn't figure out so I went to the wordpress subreddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/wordpress) and asked how to fix the problem and within minutes someone answered me back with a fix.  Wow!It was windy and rainy in Las Vegas today.  A nice change from hot, sunny weather everyday.I am working away on my next book.  Even though I didn't make much money on my last book, I still earn some money in royalties every month so in theory, the more books I write, the more little bits of royalty income I will make each month.  I'm typing as fast as I can."},
{"title": "An Update on Today's Update", "date": "Thursday, April 4, 2013", "text": "So much happened today I decided to do an update on my earlier update:I did an 11k volksmarch on the North Las Vegas Strip today.  It was so flat and such a nice walk that it didn't even feel like walking 6+ miles.  And here is a vacation tip: if you want to explore a new place when you go on vacation, go to www.ava.org and click on the state then city of where you will be.  Find the start box for the volksmarch you want to go on and pick up a walk map with directions.  You don't need to be an actual volksmarch club member and you don't need to pay.  This is an excellent way to get a free walking tour of the area you are at as volksmarches are designed to highlight interesting, scenic places.We skipped the buffet today since it was senior day.  Seniors only pay $4.99 at the Palms for a really excellent lunch buffet and the line was LONG.I decided to make an ancestor chart and a descendant chart for the genealogy presentation at our family reunion.  The ancestor chart is pretty simple...here's mom, here's dad, here's their kids.  The descendant chart, not so much.  Here's mom, here's her kid with boyfriend #1, here's another kid with husband #1, here's dad with kids from this woman and that woman...eekkk.I look like the kleenex fairy.  Used kleenex in my pocket, used kleenex in my purse, used kleenex in my computer bag...allergy season sucks.I went online to apply for the job I talked about earlier and it was making me cringe.  First you have to sign up and get a user name and password, then you have to input all of your work info, education info etc, then you need to upload a resume (why list everything then post your resume with the exact same info?), then you have to agree to pee in a cup to prove you aren't a drug addict, then you need to wait and wonder whether anyone will even look at your application...ugh.  So I decided to skip all of that and simply write a letter to the agency that is hiring for the position.  I will make the case for hiring me as a contractor as this was how I have done this type of job for years--no employee taxes, no employee benefits, no employee hassle--just contract with me for services and when the grant money runs out or you decide you don't need my services any more I am gone with no hassle whatsoever.  We'll see how well this idea goes over here.It's going to be a busy day (I'm doing another 10k walk, hitting the buffet with hubby, then heading over to the genealogy library to do some research today) but here is a quick update:I'm feeling better.  The allergies remain but the infection part is gone.I'm a bit healthier (remember this post where my blood pressure was so high?  I went with the hubby to the doctor's yesterday and had them check my blood pressure and it was 117/74 which is a huge improvement.  I think it is from all of the walking and avoiding junk food).I need to make some sort of genealogy presentation for our family reunion next week.  There are a few skeletons in the closet that I have unearthed like an aunt who everyone though belonged to an uncle that wasn't really his--I have her real dad's info but it was a big family secret since he was a criminal--plus she is still alive so I don't want to broadcast this info to everyone at the reunion so I will just list her as his kid and leave it at that, at least for reunion purposes.  And then there are people who are long dead that I have no problem highlighting, like a distant ancestor who was a witch, another ancestor who was born to a great great great etc grandfather's paramore (but she went on to be rich and successful), etc.  So I've figured that anything that affects people who are alive today will be neatly brushed over so everyone saves face and gossip from centuries past will be highlighted to make the event entertaining.I plan to get in at least eight volksmarches before we leave next week--that's 80k of walking!--so that I don't get to the marathon and collapse from lack of preparation.I may apply for a real job.  Yesterday when I was perusing the city and county jobs website I saw a job that lines up exactly with what I do (injury prevention/disaster training, etc) and thought it would be perfect for me.  The pay is good ($7k a month) but I'm not sure if I can do a 40-hour a week office job (my work has always been really flexible and I haven't had to punch a time clock in years!).  So I may apply for it anyway and see what happens."},
{"title": "20 Goals for April and Some Bad News", "date": "Monday, April 1, 2013", "text": "First, the bad news.  We were supposed to go to the Ellen show tomorrow but I called and cancelled our reservations because my allergy problem has turned into a head and chest cold/infection and I can't go ten minutes without having a coughing fit.  Since I didn't want to be tossed out of the show for disturbing the filming because it sounds like I am hacking up a lung, I figured it was best to cancel (and I wish I could say \"April Fools!\" but it isn't, I feel like crap :I ).And the goals:It seems to work out really well when I write down my monthly goals (like last month) and even though I don't reach ALL of my goals, it seems like I accomplish many more things than when I don't write down my goals and try to keep them all in my head.  So here are my goals for April (barring something like bronchial pneumonia...):Buy and install a kitchen faucet. (done!)Buy and install a shower door. (done, both mine and hubby's)Go to a reddit meet up. (fail; no meet ups this month)Go to the family reunion.

{"title": "This is What $82 Worth of Groceries Look Like", "date": "Tuesday, March 26, 2013", "text": "I have been meaning to make a blog post about the groceries I buy for some time but have never got around to it.  Actually, we usually come back from shopping and hubby puts everything away so fast I don't have time to take a picture but today I went shopping by myself (hubby is doing a four day poker tournament where the way to earn the most money is to sit in your poker seat for an ENTIRE four days--the folks there are looking pretty tired and after 30 hours hubby came home yesterday and slept for 15 hours before heading back to the casino this morning...eeekkk).  Anyway, here is my haul for today at a total cost of $82. I did a lot of shopping at the 99 cent store, and some at Walmart, Smiths, Walgreens, and Dollar General.  I generally don't clip coupons but do keep a note of things on sale listed in the weekly advertisement that gets mailed to us.  Here's what I bought:2 dozen large eggs1 gallon milk18 oz cheddar cheese1 lb butter4 lb sugar5 lb flour1 box chex cereal2 boxes of brownie mix6 oz raisins1 can Bush's baked beans2 cans spaghetti sauce4 cans vegies3 lbs oranges4 lbs onions48 oz cooking oil1 lb grapes1 lb broccolisaltbaking soda2 bottles salad dressing2 cans tuna1 can tomatoescorn meal1 loaf cinnamon bread1 box junior mints1 can instant coffee2 lbs carrots1 bunch celery2 lbs limes2 heads romaine lettuce8 bananas1 lb strawberries2 cucumbers1 lb apples1 head cauliflower5 hogie rolls2 lb tomatoesgrapefruit juicedish soap2 lb beef (steak)3.5 lb pork (roast)2.5 lb chickenI'm not sure if that is a good price or not for all of these items and I really should keep better track of the money we spend on food since that is one of the largest variable expense items in our budget.  Also, just by looking at the list I see where money could be saved (like baking our own bread products, making our own salad dressing, etc).  Finally, the price of meat is shocking!  It seems like the price of most products is relatively stable over time but every time I look at meat prices it seems like the price keeps leaping up and up!"},
{"title": "Ice Skating. Check. Concert. Check.  A Goal Update", "date": "Saturday, March 23, 2013", "text": "Yesterday I knocked two more goals off of my annual goal list!First, I went ice skating.  While I can still skate even though it's been years, I kept praying that I didn't crash and break anything because I have a marathon to walk next month!  So I skated for a bit and realized that I like roller skating better.Then we went to a concert.  A rock concert.  Actually it was a six hour rock festival but we came in at the half way point and were there for about three hours.  We saw Skid Row, Night Ranger (photo above), and Vince Neil.  I haven't been to a rock concert in like 30 years, here are the differences I noticed: then--the audience was full of screaming teenagers, including me. Now, the audience was full of screaming middle-agers, including me.  Then, the music was loud, the louder the better.  Now, the music was deafening; I really hope my hearing goes back to normal!  Then, the rockers on stage were older, like in their 20s and 30s.  Now, the rockers are still older, like in their 50s and 60s.  Overall it was an interesting experience but one I am not likely to repeat because I can hardly hear anything this morning and I value my hearing more than a rocking good time :)In other goal news:I am still trying to work in a trip to San Francisco when we go to LA.The family reunion is set up and everyone is excited to attend.We have everything set for our trip to Victoria where I will walk a marathon.My box of school supplies for the Philippines is half full.I have been doing a ton of genealogy research and have a couple of lines back to ten generations already.I deleted the book I was working on because it just wasn't coming together but as I was sailing around the skating rink yesterday I had a flash of inspiration so I am starting on a new book today.I still haven't heard back about working at the WSOP but I hope they call me!I put off getting my concealed carry license because of the expense and the fact that I would rarely, if ever, carry concealed in Las Vegas because we are in casinos nearly every day and of course you can't carry concealed in casinos.And in other news:Allergy season is upon me.  Not as bad as when we were in Georgia but still.  Ugh.I haven't been able to comment on Carla's blog in a couple of weeks.  I'm trying to figure out why.Right in the midst of wondering where my next bit of income was coming from, I got calls from two friends about doing some work for them yesterday (mostly website stuff).  Yeah!Have a wonderful weekend!"},
{"title": "Oh Happy Day!", "date": "Monday, March 18, 2013", "text": "Ever have one of those days where you are just in the zone and things go along even better than you had planned?  Well that was my day today.  I started last night with a big list of goals and other things that I wanted to accomplished this week.  I was a little disheartened because while there are a lot of things I want to do, most of the things on my list take money (some take A LOT of money) and I haven't had any freelance work in over a month so I am decidedly low on money.  But I went forward hopefully and this is what happened today:I finished up my first ten volksmarches kast Saturday so I sent my card in for recognition (that's 100k done towards reaching my goal of walking 500k this year).A month or so ago I sent in a card that came with our energy bill for free home services for seniors (hubby is a senior so we qualified).  This morning a very nice couple showed up and proceeded to replace all of our faucet and shower aerators, insulate our hot water tank, and put in new weather stripping around the door.  All for free!I have \"go to a concert\" on my annual goal list.  I would really like to go to a Celine Dion concert but that would be way too expensive ($200+ per seat!), then I was hoping to go to a Pat Benatar concert last week but alas, at $60 per person, that was too much too, so I was happy when this morning I checked FillASeat and they had a one time opportunity to get two free tickets to a rock concert later this week in Las Vegas.  When I saw that, I figured fate was knocking, and while I wouldn't have gone out of my way to go to a rock concert, I am really excited that we get to go to a concert, cross off a goal on my list, and all for a grand total of FREE!  Plus the concert is a \"rock festival\" of sorts and will feature Vince Neil, Night Ranger, Skid Row, Warrant, and Quiet Riot--all bands I used to listen to years ago!Then later this morning we were off to go rollerskating which is also on my annual goal list (I tend to have a lot of lists!) so I dragged hubby to our local skating rink and it was SO FUN!  I thought it would cost $8 to skate but was pleasantly surprised that it only cost $6.  There were about 20 seniors skating this morning and they were so nice.  This loosely organized group skates twice a week they said, and the oldest skater is 85 (and fast!); most are in the 70s and equally fast. They offered us coffee and all kinds of snacks and deserts that they brought, and then, while I happily skated around the edges (and I didn't crash and burn! Yeah!) and hubby played a game on my cell phone since he steadfastly refused to skate, we got to watch all of these cool oldsters dancing on skates and doing \"the whip\" (see photos above).  Even though I haven't skated in a couple of years I had a great time and will definitely be back!  Thank goodness for having a list of goals that challenge me and gets me up off my lazy butt otherwise I wouldn't have realized how much fun I was missing!Finally, I was worried about how I would reach a half dozen other goals I have listed for this week (ice skating, getting my concealed carry license, paying for bus tickets to the Ellen Show, paying for train tickets for part of our trip next month, etc) and was thinking there was no way I could afford all of those things this week.  So I worked on a goal that didn't require any cash outlay (I am working on my second book and hope to have it published in a few months), put my money worries out of my mind, and when I checked the mail today we received a check for $455 from our mortgage company because we had payed too much into the escrow account!  This was a stellar day!"},

{"title": "Goals and Gossip", "date": "Sunday, March 10, 2013", "text": "First the goals part:I have been chipping away at both my monthly goals and my annual goals a little at a time.  I have found that the best way to knock off these goals is to have one goal to reach per day.  I mean, I don't even work so how hard can it be to accomplish ONE thing each day?  So I make up my little list and march forward.  Today will be a volksmarch in Boulder City, tomorrow will be rollerskating, the day after will be a volksmarch in Green Valley, Wednesday will be ice skating, Thursday will be a North Strip volksmarch, Friday will be a South Strip volksmarch, and Saturday will be the genealogy club meeting.  That will knock two more goals off my annual list and give me 100k of 500k in volksmarch mileage.  I have also applied to work at the WSOP (\"work at the World Series of Poker event\" is on my annual goal list both for the experience and to make some money for our fall travel but I realized that this may not be such a great goal because I can't work there if no one will hire me so for now I am crossing my fingers that I get hired!).And the gossip part:My sister called and told me her daughter is going to have a baby.  I am a bit torn in my happiness over this.  I am happy that my niece isn't a teenager, she is in her mid 20s so that is a good thing.  I am not so happy because she doesn't have a job, her new boyfriend is \"underemployed\" as my sister puts it (never mind that my niece asked me to borrow money to pay her bills a couple of months ago because her boyfriend blew their bill money on who knows what), and most of her Facebook posts document how much alcohol she consumes and how many parties she attends :(  So for now I will try to be happy for her and the baby and hope for the best.  But after working in social services with this exact scenario popping up time and time again, it just makes me cringe a bit.  Maybe a baby will make her grow up and be more responsible.  One can only hope..."},

{"title": "Best. Purchase. Ever.", "date": "Sunday, March 3, 2013", "text": "After I bought my new cell phone I looked around for some sort of case for it.  The phone itself is a bit slippery and I was afraid I would drop it and be out $300 but the cost of gel-like cell phone covers was astronomical!  I mean who pays $50 for a cell phone cover?  Many were less than that but still, it seems like the starting price for such covers is $20.  So I hopped on Amazon, checked out the various covers available as well as the reviews, and I settled on a cover that got great reviews and only cost $2.18.  Including shipping...from Hong Kong (?!).  The cover arrived yesterday, I slipped it on my phone, and I am deliriously happy with it!  It fits like a second skin, isn't bulky, but it is really grippy.  So to date, this is one of the best purchases I have ever made!  Here's the cover."},

{"title": "20 Goals for March", "date": "Friday, March 1, 2013", "text": "Last month I wrote out my goals for February and although I didn't complete all of them, I did at least make progress and knocked quite a few things off the list.  It seems like even if I don't cross off every goal on my list, at least when I do list them out I seem to accomplish a lot more than keeping a fuzzy list in my head of things I want to do.  Which brings me to today's post: my 20 goals for March:Do an Around the Bend Friends hike. (we hiked the bird sanctuary in Henderson and it was beautiful!)Do a Lake Mead hike. (awesome hike around Lake Mead and to the Hoover Dam)Buy and install a shower door in my bathroom.Do the Boulder City volksmarch. (Ive never been to Boulder city before, it's such a cute town!)Do the Peccole Ranch volksmarch. (a really pretty walk)Do the Green Valley volksmarch. (a nice walk!)Go to a presentation by Julia Quinn (my favorite romance author). (She is so wonderful! Great talk!)Meet up with a friend who is coming to Vegas. (we met up, had dinner, and caught up. Fun!)Go to San Francisco.Go to a concert. (fun but really really loud)Get my concealed carry license.Go to a reddit meet up.Go ice skating. (fun but I like rollerskating better)Get and install a new kitchen faucet.Work on filling my first box for the school in the Philippines. (made progress by adding more books and school supplies)Go to the genealogy club meeting. (great topics and wonderful group of people!)Do two other volksmarches. (done and I sent my first event card in for recognition of some sort)Buy a good pair of walking shoes. (I LOVE them!)Get other stuff needed for our April trip (train tickets, ORCA card, Blackball tickets, etc).Go rollerskating. (so much fun!)"},
{"title": "You're...Retired?", "date": "Thursday, February 28, 2013", "text": "Now that we have been getting out and about--with our hiking group, our volksmarch group, the genealogy group, etc--one of the most common questions we get is \"what do you do?\"  I kind of stumble over this question by saying \"this is my husband, he is retired, and I...well I am kind of retired too.\"  At which point people note that I am too young to be retired.  I guess I can say \"I don't do anything\" but that sounds worse.  So for now, I consider myself retired until I find something, work-wise, that I want to do.  People's next question is often \"how can you retire at your ages? (hubby happens to look much younger than his 64 years, and, when people find out how old he is, they still think he is too young to retire).  Obviously the \"hows\" of retiring early are too complicated to discuss in passing with people and it would probably be a weird conversation if I launch into my top ten list, but for those of you who care to read it, here are the top ten reasons that we can retire early:The kids are grown, self sufficient, and living on their own.  If we had any other people to be financially responsible for, one or both of us would probably have to work.We have no debt.  It's easy to cover your basic expenses on a fixed income when there are only a few basic expenses (and not a bunch of credit cards and loans to pay off).We moved to a place with a cheaper cost of living.  Not only do our basic expenses cost less in Las Vegas than they did in Seattle, our house payment (our only debt) is a quarter of what our house payment was in Seattle (for a slightly smaller, slightly newer house).We have very few needs/wants.  Back when we were average consumers, our needs/wants list was huge--the latest electronics, the newest cars, expensive vacations, shopping sprees at Macy's, etc.  Now there is literally nothing (besides food and basic toiletries that we absolutely need).We do have a regular income coming in each month which includes the hubby's pension and his Social Security.  In addition I have some freelance income coming in occasionally.  Without hubby's income, we would definitely still be working because while you can live on much less than \"normal people\", you can't live on nothing.We are super happy living like \"poor\" people.  We only buy our clothes at the Goodwill, we have one old car that we share, we track our electricity usage to make sure our electric bill doesn't get out of hand, we mostly cook and eat at home, we find free activities to do to keep us occupied, etc.We don't have any vices.  While hubby does play poker every day, he only spends his monthly \"fun allowance\" on the game and stops for the rest of the month if he runs out of money (fortunately he actually makes money playing poker most months; the extra money he earns pays for some of our groceries and shopping!).  We don't drink, smoke, have a shopping addiction, etc which tend to cost a lot of money.We are so much more in control of our money now, even though we have less money than we have ever had before.  We do a monthly budget, we save for purchases, we discuss money together regularly...all of the things Dave Ramsey recommends.  Back when we had a lot more money, we never really talked about it--earning it or spending it--so there was no control over where it went and, surprise, we let A LOT of money slip through our fingers on frivolous purchases.We don't have anything to \"prove\" to anyone.  For many years, we wanted to keep up with the Joneses.  We didn't want people to think we were \"poor\" so we did everything financially possible to look like we were \"rich\"--leased nice cars, put our fancy vacations on credit cards, wore the latest styles, gave expensive gifts, etc.  Now I don't give a rip what people think about me.  Oddly enough, now that we have stopped caring about people judging us on appearances, those people who would judge us by appearance have gone out of our lives.We are happy hanging out together and happy with our lives.  In a lot of cases, people work hard to earn money so they can spend their earnings on things that make them happy (clothes, ATVs, going to bars, lavishing gifts on their kids, etc).  We are at the point now where material goods won't make us any happier than we are now so why spend our time slaving away at work when we can hang out together and do fun, free activities?"},
{"title": "Let Me Tell You About Our Night...", "date": "Monday, February 25, 2013", "text": "Yesterday I was so psyched!  We were looking forward to seeing Cirque du Soleil and things were going well throughout the day.  Then things got a bit messed up.First, hubby was a little late coming back from playing poker but we still had time so we went to our favorite Chinese restaurant.  Since it was Sunday we figured we would dash in for a quick meal but were shocked to see a long line.  We decided that since we had time we would wait and eventually we had a nice meal before heading off to the show.  With 30 minutes until showtime, we left the restaurant and got in our van then noticed that it had a flat tire.  Fixing it would have taken who knows how long since we had never changed the tire in the van before so hubby decided we should hop on the shuttle that had just arrived which goes from the off-strip casino to the Strip.  The shuttle dropped us off mid-strip and we hustled ourselves to the Mirage Casino where the show was being held (a little over a mile).  Did I mention I was in heels and it was freezing outside? We made it to the show with five minutes to spare, tried to put the tire situation aside for a couple of hours and enjoyed the show (we really did enjoy the show, it was amazingly elaborate and when I found out the lady next to us paid $150 for her ticket while we paid $100 for two it was a little extra bonus).After the show (about midnight now) we went in reverse--walked back down the strip, caught the shuttle and got dropped off where the van was.  Fortunately by now the parking lot had cleared out a bit so hubby moved the van into the middle of two parking spaces and we set to work.  After digging out all of the very ancient emergency stuff we kept in the back of the van and trying the Fix A Flat which didn't work at all, we set to work changing the tire.  We were both crawling around on the ground to make sure the jack was set right, it then took ages to jack up the van, then after practically wrenching off the spare which was located UNDER the van I decided to read the directions and found that there was a simple way to lower the spare that didn't involve rolling around on the ground.  We got the tire changed out then found that the spare, after hanging under the van for over a decade, was virtually flat.  We were able to drive one block on it to the gas station where we found that no amount of air would fill up the spare since it was coming apart from the rim.  Ugh.  Now it was about 1am.  So we tried putting air into the original flat tire and that seemed to work so we went about changing out the spare with the original flat yet now filled with air tire.  We were much faster this time, working like a pit crew!  Note that this wasn't in the best part of town and people were driving by slowly looking at us.  After adding a bit more air, we hoped it would hold until we got home.  Which it did. This morning hubby took the van to the tire shop and ended up buying four new tires (turns out two of the tires had nails in them and all seemed to be losing air and they were pretty much worn and had maybe 5,000 miles left).  Now the van has four brand new tires, hubby swears it drives much better, and he was able to use the least worn tire as the spare (he had to buy a new rim so it would fit where the donut did but it was cheaper than buying a new donut spare).  Whew.Lessons learned:Practice changing your tires BEFORE you need to do it in the dark in the freezing cold.When you have your tires rotated, be sure to ask them to check the air in the spare (we had never done this so it probably went flat years ago).Have a back-up plan.  If I was by myself I probably would have panicked and tried to fix the tire first thus missing the show but hubby kept a cool head and we ended up enjoying the show (if we wouldn't have shown up we would have lost the money and voided the tickets!), then fixing the tire problem.Carry cash. We had to scrounge to come up with enough quarters for the air machine.  From now on I am putting quarters and some cash in the car for emergencies.Make sure you have the correct emergency equipment in your car.  The jack and tools were right were the manufacturer put them so many years ago but we did decide we need to put a pair of work gloves in the van (our hands were pretty greasy by the time we got through), and a small tarp (the knees of our pants were similarly greasy from kneeling on the ground).Once again, having an emergency fund was a lifesaver because the tires came to a little over $500.  If we wouldn't have had money in our emergency fund we would have either been stranded or had the punctured tire repaired but it would be more susceptible to blow outs."},
{"title": "Travel. Planned.", "date": "Sunday, February 24, 2013", "text": "I really hate spending money but I didn't want to wait too long and allow prices to go up so I finally bit the bullet and got our upcoming travel paid for.  Here's the plan:We will fly in to Portland, OR on a Saturday, the day of our family reunion.  Bonus: we booked with Delta, the airline we use the most, and so we got air miles for this trip.  The cost was the same as for other airlines so we didn't pay extra just to get the miles.The day we fly in, my sister will pick up us at the airport and we will go to the reunion.We will stay two nights at my friend's house and the day after the reunion I will do a volksmarch in Vancouver (remember I am working on getting 500k in volksmarches done this year so every little bit helps!).On Monday we will take the train or Greyhound bus to Seattle.  If anyone is heading north after the reunion, we may get a ride with them which would save money.We will hit up some of our favorite places in Seattle then take the ferry over to Bainbridge Island and stay with a cousin for a few days.  There we will catch up with friends we haven't seen since we moved.  The cousin has an extra car and there is also a good bus system there so we won't have to pay (or pay much) for transportation.On Friday we will either take the cousin's car to Port Angeles or take the local bus (three separate bus systems!) to catch the ferry to Victoria BC.We booked our hotel in Victoria BC for Friday and Saturday.  On Friday I will do a 10k volksmarch with the festival group, on Saturday I will do the marathon (42k!), and I also signed up for a 21k walk on Sunday (whether I do this or not will depend on how crippled I am from the marathon!).On Sunday we wanted to take the ferry through the San Juan Islands then connect with the city buses to get back to Seattle then take the ferry back to Bainbridge Island but it looks like many of the city buses aren't running on Sunday so we may end up taking the car to Port Angeles, leaving it there for the weekend, then taking the ferry back to Pt Angeles on Sunday and picking up the car and driving back to the cousin's house.  Or we will take the bus to Port Angeles, stay an extra night in Victoria, then take the ferry through the San Juan Islands.  This part is still up in the air.We fly back to Vegas on Tuesday.  Again, we fly Delta and while the cost was a bit higher than the lowest cost flight, it gave us air miles AND it was only four hours of flying with one stop while the other flights were something like six to eight hours.Overall, we plan to make use of public transit as much as possible instead of renting a car to save money, stay with family and friends to save on hotel costs, and also try to cram in as much activity as possible while we are there!"},
{"title": "Travel Planning, Goal Planning", "date": "Thursday, February 21, 2013", "text": "I have $1000 and a whole bunch of goals I want/need to complete in the next few months.  First off, the hubby is sooo sweet to keep $500 of our tax return for whatever he wants to spend it on and give me $1000 from the return for my goals.  Considering that all of the income for the past year was his, that is extremely generous of him!  Sooo, here's is the plan for the next few months:FebruaryGoal: Lake Mead Hike.  Cost: $0.  I'm going with the Around the Bend Friends hiking group this Saturday and there is no charge to tag along.Goal: Go on an Around the Bend Friends hike.  Cost: $0.  Fortunately I can kill two birds with one (free) stone by going with this group to hike around Lake Mead which is on the goal list.Goal: Go to a Cirque du Soleil show.  Cost: $130.  Fortunately this is already paid for, unfortunately, even though the tickets were $99 for two tickets, the taxes and fees were an additional $30(!).Not on the goal list but stuff I still need to do: do one more volksmarch.MarchGoal: Get a concealed carry permit.  Cost: $200.  Although the class is offered for free, there is a cost for the firearm rental and ammo as well as the permit application.Goal: Go to a concert.  Cost: $70.  I really really want to go to a Pat Benatar concert this March in Las Vegas.  I went to her concert way back in the '80s when tickets were around $20 but apparently prices have increased quite a bit!Goal: Go ice skating.  Cost: $10.  This should be simple as there is an ice rink in Las Vegas so I just need to make time to go.Goal: Go to a Reddit meet up.  Cost: $10.  Our local Reddit group plans occasional meet-ups so this month I will make a concerted effort to join them.Not on the goal list but stuff I still need to do: meet up with a friend who is coming to Vegas, do three volksmarches.AprilGoal: Go to family reunion in Vancouver, WA.  Cost: $300.  The cost for this is just airfare and a bit of spending money.  We will be staying at my friend's house and using her car for the few days we are there.Goal: Walk a marathon.  Cost: $600.  The weekend after the reunion there will be a volksmarch marathon in Victoria, BC.  The cost is for hotel, transportation and spending in BC, and transportation home.Goal: Send a box of books and school supplies to the Philippines.  Cost: $200.  I still have a bunch of space to fill up in the box and the cost of shipping is $70.Goal: Go roller skating.  Cost: $50.  I want to take my nieces skating when I am at the reunion.Not on the goal list but stuff I still need to do: go on the Ellen show, meet up with another friend who is coming to Vegas, do a total of 100k in volksmarches this month.MayGoal: Go on a cruise.  Cost: $1000.  There are cruises going from Los Angeles to Vancouver, BC this month.  This would position me for the next goal.Goal: Bike from Canada to Mexico.  Cost: $3000. This is a big big goal on the list and there are still a lot of details to work out (I don't even have a bike yet and how to get hubby from Canada to Mexico NOT riding a bike but with me on the trip are among the biggies).Goal: Visit San Francisco.  Cost: $0.  San Francisco is both a stop on the cruise and right in the middle of the bike ride.Not on the goal list but stuff I still need to do: do 100k of volksmarches (there are many along the bike route).All of those things add up to about $5500 so $1000 will barely make a dent in the cost of achieving all of these goals but like the saying says, \"go confidently in the direction of your dreams\" and the rest that I can't remember has something to do with 'circumstances will align to help you reach your goals even when the going looks impossible'.  Which it does now but still I have faith that I will be able to achieve many of these things as planned."},

{"title": "Five Things Friday", "date": "Friday, February 15, 2013", "text": "Happy Friday everyone!  Here's a quick update:Remember when I said that you MUST write your goals down? Here is yet another example of how writing my goals down has serendipitously turned into another great opportunity: I have \"go to a Cirque du Soleil show\" on my annual goals list.  I of course had no idea how we were going to do that since tickets for these popular shows in Las Vegas run $100+ per person but I put it on the list anyway because people rave about these shows.  Fast forward to today when I turned the TV on this morning and lo and behold an advertisement came on for a special \"Las Vegas locals\" deal on Cirque tickets...$89 for two people!  We will definitely be going :)Our tax refund landed in our bank account today, 15 days after I filed our taxes online. Wow that was fast!  We still have no idea what we want to spend this money on so decided to just let it sit in savings until something comes up (unfortunately I think the next big purchase coming up will be a new transmission since it is acting kind of 'clunky' but hubby said it isn't that bad that we need to replace it...yet).  Anyway, I am just happy to have an extra bit of financial cushion and I am amazed at how quickly our refund came in.I was SOOOO tempted to apply for a credit card today.  It seems like for the past month or so I have been getting credit card offers in my email box and these offers always seem to include something like 35,000 air miles for applying.  I LOVE air miles and I love to travel but every time I think of applying for a credit card I chicken out.  It is really very tempting but I don't want to get a card when I don't even have a job.  It would be nice for the air miles, of course, and it would also be nice to have some form of credit but every time I even consider applying for a credit card I hear Dave Ramsey's voice in my head saying NOOOOOOO.  So I deleted the email and will have to do without the air miles :(Everyone has received copies of my book that I mailed out last week and they are raving about it (I think people are just happy to get a free surprise in the mail).  So I asked them to please write a review for the book and hopefully that will help improve sales.Gas prices have risen astronomically in the past couple of weeks.  Last month we were at $2.89 per gallon and today the price is $3.50 per gallon and that is a shockingly quick rise in prices.

{"title": "More Goals Completed!", "date": "Thursday, February 14, 2013", "text": "Wow it's been a busy week.  I just checked and can't believe I haven't posted here for almost a week!  Here's what we have been doing:I've crossed two more goals off of my 2013 goal list.  A couple of days ago we went to Mt Charleston (yes there really is a mountain with snow and skiing only 30 minutes from Las Vegas!) and today we were in north Las Vegas so we decided to head up the highway and go to the Valley of Fire (which is, IMHO, nearly as cool as the Grand Canyon!).We celebrated Valentine's Day yesterday by going out to lunch at Fogo de Chao which is a Brazilian steak house.  It is expensive as I have noted here before but we had a $25 off coupon and the SIL told hubby to go and enjoy a nice dinner on her for his birthday so we combined these and decided to celebrate Valentine's Day a day early because that way we got a less crowded restaurant and much better service.  It was yummy :)This morning I got my usual card from the hubby for Valentine's day.  For years and years the hubby has always made me a card instead of buying one and they are so nice and touching.  I would much rather read his sentiments than get a standard card from Hallmark.  This year his card nearly made me cry it was so touching and sweet about how much he loves me.  AawwwwBest of all, hubby had a doctor's appointment today and I was pretty worried.  A month ago he did his usual set of blood tests and his new doctor said his PSA level came back pretty high so today's appointment was with a specialist and I was kind of dreading the worst (a high PSA level often means prostate cancer).  So after a long wait for the doctor today he came in and said \"the lab made a mistake and your PSA level is fine, better than fine for your age, so you don't need to see me.\"  Needless to say I heaved a sigh of relief and was really relived (as was the hubby of course).I hope you all had a wonderful Valentine's Day today!!"},

They had a ton of genealogy resources, the staff was so nice and helpful, the place was free to use even if you aren't part of their church, and I got loads of documents that otherwise I wouldn't have been able to access unless I was a paid member of Ancestry.com (like copies of old census records, etc).Hubby vacuumed out the van then I took it to get the oil changed and I was surprised that when I went to pay for the oil change the guy told me there was no charge because the hubby often drops off food for the crew that works there (they are all Filipino guys that work there and hubby often cooks Filipino food for himself so he drops the leftovers by the shop on his way to the casino).  That saved me $15!My order of books got delivered a few days ago so I quickly packaged them up and sent them--at media mail rate--to friends in Washington State.  I will ask them to help me promo them by writing a review on Amazon or telling their friends about the book.  So while this cost me about $85 to order the books and mail them, I am hoping it is a good investment in future sales.I ordered another birth and death certificate which is kind of expensive ($26 and $20 respectively) but on a happy note, I occasionally run across free resources in my research (some states have genealogy records archived so I have found some marriage certificates and death records for free online).And finally, I sent a nice email to my friend to see where my checks were.  I was kind of uncomfortable doing this because it is hard to ask for money but it was owed to me and while she is usually timely in paying me, these checks were nearly two months late.  By the time she got my email, she had already sent the checks so I did receive them and a very nice apology in my voice mail because she had been overwhelmed at work lately.Overall, a very productive few days. p.s. To my friends on the east coast, I hope you are staying safe and warm this weekend!!!"},

Complete With Blogger Awards", "date": "Wednesday, February 6, 2013", "text": "As I usually do each morning, I was eating my breakfast and drinking my tea and checking out what all of my blogger friends have done since yesterday (note, I usually read your blogs but don't comment nearly enough but I do read them each morning) and I was surprised to see that I made this list over at An Exacting Life blog.  What a nice surprise and what a nice way to start the morning!In keeping with the concept, here is my list of \"top 10 blogs\" in no particular order (excluding An Exacting Life because that's the rules although I do love her blog because it's interesting and listy which I absolutely love).The blogs:Clamco: Lorraine was the first person to comment on my blog which surprised me to no end because someone actually read my blog!  Since then she has been inspiring and a great cheerleader and an overall wonderful person (not to mention an EBay diva which makes reading her blog so fascinating!).My 1/2 Dozen Daily: Carla is clever and artistic and her blog photos are amazing (did I mention she frugally runs a family of six plus an online business plus a popular blog? Wow!).That British Woman: Gil has a wonderful blog. I love her British sense of humor and all of the interesting things she posts about Canada (for our nearest neighbor, I thought I knew a lot about Canada until I started reading her blog!).Out My Window: Kim is one of the busiest people I know (well, not like ever met, but by reading her blog I feel as if I know her) and while she documents her ups and downs and struggles, she always comes out a winner so she is very inspiring!Living Richly in Retirement: I have been following Barb's blog for ages and from one retiree to another, I tend to learn a lot from her and her wonderful blog!Tales from the Trenches: Cassie is another blogger who is listy and organized and I always learn something from reading her fascinating blog.My Journey to Eliminate Debt: I always check this blog since she talks about getting out of debt and Dave Ramsey and getting more organized...basically all of the things that interest and inspire me.Shaking the Money Tree: Jolie is another blogger that I follow regularly.  Like the rest of us, she has her financial challenges, financial success, and lots of other interesting things to blog about.One Family One Income:  I just started following this blog recently but I really find it fascinating (maybe because she says stuff like \"eekkk\" like I do?).  Definitely a fun read!Digging Out of Debt, One Spoonful at a Time: These sisters write a wonderful blog about getting out of debt and about the mundane stuff of every day life which, oddly enough, I find fascinating.And seven things about me:I don't sleep with a pillow (apparently that is odd).I like to eat food one item at a time so mostly I graze through my meals (buffets make me nauseous).My pet peeve is when people use big words incorrectly (better to use a smaller, less impressive word correctly then a big, impressive word incorrectly).I love communicating with people (in different languages, in writing, to figure out their problem and help them) but I am lousy at small talk.I love doing research.  Reading, writing, research...that's about all I am good at.I really want to be artistic but I am just not.  Even with practice, I don't have an artistic bone in my body.  It's unfortunate.I have Aspergers (which probably explains all of the above).And the rules if you are on my top ten blog list and want to participate:Thank the person who nominated you.Add the One Lovely Blog Award/Very Inspiring Blogger Award to your post.Share seven things about yourself.Pass the award on to 10 nominees.Include this set of rules.Inform your nominees by posting on their blogs."},
{"title": "20 Goals for the Rest of February", "date": "Tuesday, February 5, 2013", "text": "I am so goal-oriented it's crazy.  I have a list of annual goals, a list of daily goals, and when things get hectic, I also write down my weekly goals.  Here's what I plan to accomplish for the rest of the month:Do a volksmarch by myself (I missed the group walk in January and want to make it up).Go to the family history center to do some genealogy research (I just got the death certificate for my great grandmother and it says she was divorced at the time of her death.  This was in the 1930s.  Now I'm wondering WHY because getting divorced then was a big deal.  I swear I find a new mystery with every person I research!).Vacuum out the van, get it washed, and get the oil changed (we haven't done this in AGES).Go on a hike in the Valley of Fire petrified forest (free through the park service and going to the Valley of Fire is on my annual goal list).Go on our usual Monday hike in Red Rock Canyon (that's hubby on one of our past hikes in the photo above).Go ice skating (also on my annual list; I am trying to do five of these annual goals a month.  I wish my nieces and nephews were here to go with me but I will go by myself; hubby said \"no way\" to his doing this goal).Go to Mt Charleston and play in the snow (also on the annual goal list, I just can't believe there is snow only a half hour away from Vegas so I want to see for myself).Doctor's appointments (one for me, one for hubby).Valentine's Day (still have no idea what to do for the hubby for this holiday).Replace the kitchen faucet (it's leaking and I want a nice faucet like this). Go to my monthly genealogy club meeting.Go on another group volksmarch next Saturday.Do a hike at Lake Mead with the ATBF hiking group (both hiking with this group and hiking the Lake Mead area in particular are both on my annual goal list).Mail 10 copies of my book to friends in Washington (I am still selling a trickle of books each month but I think that having friends help promote it and doing this in the spring which is prime time for tourist actives there will help sales).Order another birth certificate and another death certificate for my genealogy research (these are expensive at $20 to $25 a pop!).Buy and install a shower door for my bathroom shower (I was supposed to do this last month and didn't get around to it).Take a concealed carry class (I have a concealed carry license for Washington but need to get one for Nevada which requires a class).Plan a trip to San Francisco for March (the trip for February with the cousins fell through because we had to be here for our doctor's appointments which couldn't be changed).Get paid by my friend (I did some work for my friend's business and she said she would pay me a month ago and so far, no check.  She has never been this flaky before but somehow I need to get her to pay me...after already asking about it repeatedly :I  ).Decide on a cruise.  We are debating between doing a cruise in March or waiting until the fall (this is also on my annual goal list)."},
{"title": "Five Things...An Update", "date": "Sunday, February 3, 2013", "text": "Here's what I've been doing the past few days:I did my taxes online with H & R Block.  I've used this service for a few years and it is soooo simple and sooo cheap ($29.95, even with business income and itemized deductions). I just enter the information and hit send and my taxes are done and sent to the IRS.  This year we will be getting back about $1600 which always amazes me because for so many years with both the hubby and I working, we would always owe taxes.  I know that people say you should make it so the government doesn't get such a big, interest-free loan but I like having a lump sum come in all at once instead of relying on myself to actually put that much money aside in savings (I'm fairly horrible at saving money).I did my first volksmarch of the year yesterday with the local volksmarch club.  We did a 10k walk on the Las Vegas Strip and hubby even went along noting he would much rather walk the Strip in Las Vegas then go on a volksmarch in Seattle (which usually included a lot of hills and trees and rain).  Since I want to walk 500 km with the volksmarchers this year, I better get busy walking!I came across this article which made me say wow, hmmm, and yep I agree.I am putting together another box of children's books and school supplies for an elementary school in the Philippines.  The kids, and especially the teachers, appreciate these things SO MUCH because they really have so very little there (see photo of happy kids above).  If you would like to donate any items to go in this box, please send me an email at aprilborbon@gmail.com.I also came across this very useful tip in case your car ever gets stolen (see last paragraph of this article).I hope you are having a wonderful weekend (and enjoying the Super Bowl today!)."},
{"title": "More Clever Hubby Tricks", "date": "Friday, February 1, 2013", "text": "Whenever I have a problem, the hubby usually comes to the rescue with a (very cheap) fix.  Before we left for LA I asked him what I should do about my cell phone.  When I carry it in my purse, there is a hard-sided pocket that keeps it protected but since I only took a small travel bag with me (a nylon LeSportsac) I was afraid that if I put the phone in the side pocket it would get squished.  The average consumer would run out and buy a practically indestructible Otterbox, frugal consumers like me end up with a cardboard box like this (which, BTW, worked exceptionally well to keep my phone protected in my bag):"},
{"title": "Back from LA!", "date": "Thursday, January 31, 2013", "text": "We just returned from a wonderful, if hurried, trip to Los Angeles.  Here's the details:The TripWe paid a total of 50 cents for the hubby and I to go round trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles due to a promo price.  Some people paid $5 each way for the trip, some $10, some $20 each way.The Megabus is speedy because it goes from one city to the other with no additional stops.I thought taking an over night bus would be great because we could sleep on the bus and wake up refreshed in LA.  Overnight buses in Japan are super comfy and recline fully so you can actually sleep on them, not so these buses which are much like city buses so we arrived having had a couple of cat naps and were pretty tired.It was nice that the bus had plug ins at each seat to keep my cell charged.  They were also supposed to have free wi fi which didn't work (apparently their wi fi never works according to reviews).We paid $6 each for 24 hour bus passes once we got to LA.  These passes allowed us to ride the buses and trains everywhere including right to the front door of our destination which was the Sunset Bronson Studios.  The bus/train service in LA is awesome!  We also hopped off in Koreatown for lunch.The bus arrived an hour early so we ended up in LA at 5am so we had breakfast at Denny's which was across from the station in order to kill time.  Plus lunch, we spent about $20 on food.  We also brought snacks and water with us but since Phad Thai looked better than a cold sandwich hubby gave his sandwich to a homeless guy, and we ate Thai food in Koreatown.The ShowWe got free tickets to the Jeff Probst Show via their website.  I LOVE this show and it is on my goal list so this was a win win all the way around.Our line to get into the show was right next to the line to get into the \"Let's Make a Deal\" show.  Our line didn't have costumes on and theirs did...funny.  There were only about 20 or so people like us in line for the show.  The rest were paid actors from a service to fill in audience space (we heard this is common for new shows that haven't developed an audience yet).  All of those people looked beautiful and peppy.  Most of us regular people looked like we just rolled off an all-night bus.We were in the \"party room\" for about an hour before the show where hubby used the massage chair, we took photos in the photo booth, some people played Wii, and we got free food from the snack bar (water, granola bars, etc).In the audience they arranged us, surprisingly, by what color we were wearing (they want a nice look to the audience and having ten people in blue sitting together would look weird I guess).  At least the hubby and I got to sit together because we weren't wearing different colors.The girl that kept the audience entertained before the show was really funny and entertaining.  She had some people stand up and dance, had us practice cheering, etc.The show itself had six segments and went by really fast.  Jeff Probst is as sincere and energetic as he appears on TV and his guest was Sanjay Gupta who was interesting.Because the show was about Sanjay Gupta's new project, a TV series, everyone in the audience got a free copy of his book on which the show is based.  One of the actors from the new series was also on the show (the one on the far right on the cover of the book).At the end of the show, the producers wanted some audience shots which are edited into the show I assume so they filmed us laughing, cheering, looking surprised, looking shocked, etc.  At which point I decided I would NOT make a good actress (my only reaction was looking at all of the actor types making the appropriate expressions and cracking up).And an added bonus: when I told hubby we were going to the Jeff Probst Show he said \"I like Ellen why didn't you get tickets for her show?\"  So I went online and reserved tickets for the last week of filming for the season and surprisingly I got a call yesterday as we were leaving Jeff's show to ask if we still wanted the tickets for Ellen's show during the first week of April.  I said OF COURSE!  So we will go back to LA in April and be in the audience of the Ellen Show!!"},
{"title": "I'm Loving My New Smartphone!", "date": "Tuesday, January 29, 2013", "text": "I know it took me forever to move from a dumb phone to a smart phone but I have come to the conclusion that I maybe should have made the switch sooner...I LOVE my new phone!!Note, I don't know what gets into Blogger sometimes, the picture of my phone is posting sideways but it is supposed to show the phone straight up and down and I don't know how to rotate the photo so despite the weird photo, I'll continue...Anyway, I've only had the phone for a little over a week but even though I am online at home quite a bit and didn't think I really needed a smartphone, I have ended up using the apps on this phone quite a bit.The apps I currently have on my phone:News apps: CNN, Kitsap Sun (hometown newspaper so I can keep up with people I know there), News 8 (Las Vegas station), News 13 (another Vegas station)Email: Yahoo, HotmailBlogger (although I haven't figured out how to sign in through this app yet)Advanced task killer (to keep the apps from running continuously)Banking: KFCU, NFCU, Wells Fargo (I can also make deposits just by photographing a check and sending it to the bank through the apps), PayPalSocial media: FaceBook, Twitter, Chikka (for texting with friends in Asia), Reddit (I'm pretty much addicted to Reddit)Camera (for quick picture taking), Gallery (to view the pictures I've taken)Memo, Polaris Office, Calendar (for my to-do lists and to stay organized)Kindle (I've read two books so far on my phone)Web (for quick access to the internet)Google Sky (not necessary but very cool, check it out!)Scanner Radio (ditto)Music Player (I don't listen to music often but it is nice to have it right there on my phone if I want to)Sudoku (for when I'm bored)C:Geo (I want to start geocaching; this is an app for www.geocaching.com)Flashlight, calculator (useful tools to have)Currency exchange, Translate, Android weather (great for travel)Travelocity, Orbitz (ditto)TeleNav GPS (I've already used this a half dozen times!)And some other things to note:I need to charge the phone every day or it will die; I liked my old phone because I only had to charge it once a week.The $30 plan for the phone is great, the only slight problem is that it only comes with 100 talk minutes so now I make it a habit to use hubby's phone when I need to call and talk to someone.I have to be a lot more careful with this phone because it was expensive ($300) and I don't want to drop it or have it stolen (I could drop my old phone and it wouldn't hurt it a bit and no one in their right mind would have wanted to steal it!).I have made a pointed effort to not use my phone at all when in the company of other people (it's kind of my pet peeve that most people are sitting in a restaurant with other people yet all of their attention is focused on their phone, not the people they are with).On a negative note, I am getting ready to go to LA this evening and I couldn't get any free books to download to my cell phone (takes up less space than carrying a whole book; getting free downloadable books from the library is good but there is no way to say when you want to download them as the notice shows up randomly in email after putting them on hold) so I went to Amazon.com and paid $1.99 for a book from one of my favorite authors.  This is definitely a splurge and I hope it doesn't become a habit but it is so easy and convenient!All of the above apps are free.  At this point I can't think of any app that I would actually want to pay for.Do you know of any other good apps that I should check out?"},

{"title": "A Great Trip!", "date": "Saturday, January 26, 2013", "text": "I use the word \"trip\" loosely of course because we only went a few miles away from home but we had a great time staying downtown for a couple of nights! The hotel was nice enough; we woke up to rain in our room on the second day--odd because we were on the 17th floor and there were a half dozen floors above us--but heck, it was free.  Turns out the guy above us overfilled his bathtub.  The show was great (we got front row seats for the Gordie Brown show at the same hotel we stayed at, for free, through FillASeat; he was really entertaining and his band was excellent! The food was also excellent (three free meals at a wonderful Italian restaurant also at the same hotel due to a $50 restaurant gift certificate that hubby had previously won from online poker).  And to top it off, hubby won about $50 in their poker room which more than paid for our only expenses, tips, for our mini vacation!In addition to the overall wonderful experience, the hotel had a really nice pool that featured a huge fish (shark?) tank (see photo above) and I also got to check off a couple of my 50 goals for 2013 which were swimming (hubby and I walked about a half mile to the municipal pool since I didn't want to \"be on display\" at the hotel's pool--the pool is surrounded on all sides by glass just off the main lobby so everyone passing by can see you...in a bathing suit...eeek).  It was a really nice facility that we will be sure to return to and I also went to a Vegas Jelly meet up which I have been wanting to do for over a year (it's a tech group and their discussion was so far over my head--leveraging APIs and platforms to enhance your coding--that I felt like a first grader suddenly sitting in a high school calculus class!).Now to prepare for our next adventure--going to LA and being in the Jeff Probst show audience next week!"},

{"title": "Our Trip to LA", "date": "Friday, January 18, 2013", "text": "I got the email yesterday that we will be in the audience for the Jeff Probst show on January 30th (this was one of my goals for this year).  I'm so excited!!!!  I love the show and watch it anytime I am by a TV at 2 in the afternoon.  The show is always positive and inspiring unlike other daytime TV talk shows so this should be a wonderful experience!To get to Los Angeles where the show is taped, our options are to rent a car (our car is old and hubby is afraid it might break down if we drive it so far), pay for gas, pay for a hotel room, and pay extra for car insurance (expensive because it is through the car rental agency but since we only carry liability on our old car it is a necessity).  We would need to get a hotel because we have to be at the studio by 9am and it is a six hour drive from Las Vegas.Or...I came up with a better, if more off-beat idea.  We can take the Megabus from Las Vegas for $12 each person, each way.  Leave at midnight, sleep on the bus, arrive at 6am, take the city bus to the studio, enjoy the show, go get lunch, then take the Megabus back at 5pm, arriving back in Las Vegas at 11pm.  I think that will be the way we go because it is #1, much cheaper, #2, it means we won't have to drive, and #3 saves us staying in a hotel. The next couple of weeks will be super busy, we have three hikes and one volksmarch planned, we will go to a comedy club tomorrow night and I have a genealogy society meeting tomorrow, we reserved the hotel in downtown Las Vegas for next week for two nights (free from hubby's online poker winning), while we are staying downtown I will go to a Jelly meet up (it's a tech group that meets every week but I am usually too lazy at night to drag myself out for their 8pm meeting but since we will be right down the street from where they meet I will definitely make it a point to attend), and we also will go swimming (both of us, again, it's on my goal list) and ice skating (just me, hubby said no way to that but it is also on my goal list and I haven't skated in ages).  Whew!I hope you have a wonderful weekend!"},

{"title": "ACK I'm Officially Old", "date": "Thursday, January 10, 2013", "text": "And yes, it has been documented and verified.  Here's the story...I was at the doctor's with the hubby a couple of days ago.  I always go in with him for his appointments because he forgets what the doctor says or doesn't ask stuff about his medications, etc.  So we were both sitting there and I was next to the blood pressure machine and the nurse asked if she should take my blood pressure first so I said yes.  My test results--from cholesterol to blood pressure to blood sugar, etc--ALWAYS come out great.  This time my blood pressure was HIGH!  It was 147/90 and I was shocked.  So shocked that she redid it and again it read the same.  So when the doctor came in, he talked to me as well as the hubby.  He asked if I wanted medication for my high blood pressure and I said \"noooooooo\".  High blood pressure is an old person problem!  And then I realized that I am getting to be an old person. OMG!  So I calmed down a bit and told the doctor that it was probably high because of my extremely sedentary lifestyle and my really crappy diet and that I would see what changes I could make myself.  Here are the changes I have made in the last couple of days:I walked twice yesterday for 45 minutes each.  I have always been really active until the last five years or so and I think this is the main cause of the problem so I have resolved to get more active.  And I really have no excuse, the weather is beautiful and sunny here nearly every day of the year.I immediately stopped all junk food.  No Baskin Robbins, no ice cream, no potato chips...just fruit.  Cue the massive caffeine headache.  Cue hubby commenting \"here we go again.\"We will not be eating out nearly as often as before.  Having worked in restaurants years ago, I know that almost all of the food that is served in restaurants is loaded with salt, sugar, fat, etc. in order to make it taste better than what you eat at home.  It is super easy for us to eat out because all of the restaurants we go to are free with hubby's comps but by eating at home, we will really know what it is we are eating and can skip the high salt and added fat.De-stressing.  I'm did some deep breathing but I have a head cold so that didn't work so well. I am also less stressed when I am not on the roads of Las Vegas (people drive like maniacs here and it is super stressful).So mainly my plan is to exercise more and not eat junk food and see what happens after that."},

{"title": "2013 Is Off to a Great Start!!", "date": "Tuesday, January 1, 2013", "text": "Happy first day of the new year!  Our year has started off really well:For New Year's Eve last night, the hubby and I compromised.  He wanted to go to the Strip (with 150,000 other people! eekkk) and I wanted to stay home (warm, safe, in my pajamas) so we decided to head over to a local casino, ring in the New Year with the crowd (many were drunk because the casino had a $20 all you can drink special...they were quite the animated crowd!), and had their midnight breakfast special ($2.95 for eggs, sausage or bacon, toast, and hash browns...yummy but I really shouldn't eat so much that late at night.  Lesson learned.).  Overall, we were both happy with our little celebration of the new year.I decided to treat myself to a Baskin Robbins Blast today (see photo above).  This is the first time ever that I have had junk food on the first day of the year because usually on the first day of the year I am swearing off all junk food (yeah right) and resolving to exercise every day (ditto).  So this year I decided to try reverse psychology.  If I don't make such rigid rules about my diet (like never ever ever eating junk food again) I think I might have better luck with improving my diet.  Sounds good in theory...Hubby played poker today so I went with him, took my laptop, and got lots of work done for one of my clients (which for me is a perfect way to spend the first day of the year).While hubby was playing poker, someone on their table hit the big jackpot (the guy won $25,000!) so hubby's share of the jackpot (half goes to the winner, 25% goes to the next highest hand and 25% of the jackpot is split between everyone who is playing poker at the time which is what hubby won) was $550 of which he gave me $200.  Now that is a great way to start the year!We had a nice dinner at the casino while hubby was waiting for his money (it takes about three hours for all the paperwork to get done) which was free with his comps.  Even though meals are free we still only get one meal and split it because the portions are so big.Then to cap off our evening, we went to our first free show from FillASeat.  It was held in a small, run down hotel that we probably would otherwise have never known about but the singers were good and  the audience seemed to make up for the small number of attendees by cheering extra laud so it was really fun and we are looking forward to going to more shows soon.I hope you all got off to a great start to the new year as well!  I wish you a prosperous and happy new year!"},
{"title": "Happy New Year's Eve!", "date": "Monday, December 31, 2012", "text": "Are you all ready to ring in the new year?  This is how we spent the last day of the year:Hubby called his bank and they did waive the overdraft fee due to his \"senior moment.\"  Hubby is very happy that he now has an extra $30!I called our internet company and while they wouldn't/couldn't continue our $19.99 monthly internet fee, the sixth person I talked to finally got the price down to $34.95 plus the first month free for six months so we were happy with that discount (the cost for this speed internet is usually $65 a month).We went to Fogo de Chao for lunch today, compliments of a Christmas gift from hubby's sister.  Can you imagine paying $70 for lunch??  I mean it is a nice lunch (kind of like an all meat buffet because it is a Brazilian steak house) but $70 would pay for nearly two weeks of groceries for us!  But we thoroughly enjoyed the meal and are very thankful to the SIL for such a nice gift.Speaking of nice gifts, one of the cousins gave us a membership to FillASeat for Christmas.  I had never heard of it before but I activated our membership and it seems to provide a range of completely free Las Vegas shows for the duration of membership.  So I reserved seats for us for a Frank Sinatra tribute show for tomorrow night.  I guess the catch is that when you sign up for a show it says \"you must attend this show or you will lose your membership\" which is reasonable because if the company is guaranteeing that seats will be filled they need to be pretty strict about people actually showing up.  This should be interesting (and hubby said he would be willing to go to a show every single day...we will see how much entertainment I can stand!).The country went over the fiscal cliff today for us Americans.  I'm not sure that it will impact us because it looks like tax increases will hit people starting at about $50k earnings per year and we are way under that since I don't work.  Obviously that doesn't bode well for most of the people in the country, however, and I'm sure families making $50k per year can't really afford an extra $3500 in taxes taken out of their paychecks.  Ugh.We still haven't decided what to do for New Year's Eve.  We have about seven hours to decide.  Hubby wants to go to the Strip and I would rather stay home and watch the whole thing on TV (once on the Strip last year was enough for me!).  We'll see what happens...I hope you have a wonderful New Year's Eve.  Be safe!!!"},
{"title": "10 Reasons to Become Debt Free in 2013", "date": "Sunday, December 30, 2012", "text": "If you already are debt free you might want to skip this post but if you aren't, read through these great reasons to get out of debt then head over to Dave Ramsey's website and follow his plan (I am a HUGE Dave Ramsey fan because following his plan, and watching his daily show for nearly two years straight, is what got us out of debt!).You won't have to work nearly as much (and it's corollary, you won't have to work at a job you hate or be afraid of losing your job since when you have no debt, you can easily support yourself with a part time or minimum wage job).You won't fall victim to scams.  There are a number of scams that use debt and credit to scam money from unsuspecting people (ie: something along the lines of \"Mrs X, we did not receive your payment for your credit card bill last month and now we can sue you...unless you pay us with another credit card. What is that card number now?\"  And scams like that really happen!  Shocking!).You will be better able to handle a crisis.  Whether it is taking time off of work to be with a sick loved one or throwing all of your income at buying a new ______ (stove, washing machine, etc), it is much simpler to handle a crisis when you aren't up to your eyeballs in debt.You won't leave your spouse buried in debt if you unexpectedly die.  I saw this happen more than a half dozen times when I was working in social services.  A person, usually a lady, would come in looking shell shocked due to her husband's death then she would drop a huge bag of mail--mostly bills--on my desk and ask what she should do since she had never worked before or earned very little money and there was so life insurance and nearly ever piece of mail was a bill.  It's sad.  And scary.  I would never want to leave the hubby like that.The sense of freedom at becoming debt-free is truly liberating.  It is really hard to describe the feeling of having NO DEBT.  You feel inordinately free and the first few months are kind of weird because you keep waiting for bills to come in and there aren't only, just lots of left over money that used to go to pay debt that is now just sitting there with no claim on it.You will officially be \"weird\".  According to Dave Ramsey, \"normal\" is broke and in debt while debt-free people are \"weird\".  I would much rather be weird.  And debt-free people tend to act a bit weird too--they don't have the newest cell phone (too expensive and not worth the hyper-inflated price), they pay cash for their cars, they live frugally even when they don't have to, they will go on a vacation...for a month or two.  Stuff like that.You will be able to actually afford stuff.  With cash.  Weird concept, I know, when it seems like every retailer on the planet has gone to extremes to help their customers \"afford\" stuff (in 1000 easy payments or so).  This makes it both better (you won't be paying interest or late fees or having your expensive stuff repossessed when you miss a payment) and worse (being a rampant consumer ceases being \"fun\" when you understand how much you have to work to afford each item you buy so you become super careful with how you spend your money). Your stress level will ratchet down considerably.  For most people, their stress level directly correlates to their debt level.  When you are in debt, your credit cards are maxed out, you are paying interest fees/over limit fees/late fees, you can't call in sick to work because you can't afford to not get paid for that day, and you have three financial crisis hit in the same month, life sucks and you are stressed.  When you have no debt, you may still stress a bit about money (mostly about how you will earn the money to pay cash for your next big purchase) but it is not nearly as debilitating as when you are in debt.At the end of 2013 you will thank yourself for being so wise at the beginning of the year and also thank yourself for digging yourself out of debt so you can start the next new year DEBT FREE!You will set an example for others.  Maybe.  People in debt don't often want to hear others preach about becoming debt free because it sounds good in theory but it is a whole lot of hard work which is about where the enthusiasm for becoming debt-free stops.  And then you just sound like a religious zealot.  So while setting an example for others, remember to be subtle and only offer advice as it is requested.  Or you can just blog about it...and blog...and blog...and blog.So here's to a debt-free 2013!  There is no better time to get out of debt than NOW (and yes, I'm taling to myself as well.  I absolutely hate having any debt and even though our house mortgage is considered a \"good debt\" it still is a debt and I want to get is paid off ASAP)."},

{"title": "10 Ways to Get 2013 Off To an Organized Start", "date": "Wednesday, December 26, 2012", "text": "The end of the year always gets me motivated to become super organized.  I have visions of creating the perfectly organized life which will help me waft effortlessly into my future, never mind that I pretty much suck at reaching any meticulously organized goals I set.  That being said, these are the things I am doing this week in order to start the new year off on a positive foot:Write out the goals I want to achieve in 2013 (and post them publicly so there will be some kind of accountability...which I did here).List all of the bills we pay (monthly bills, semi-monthly bills, bi-annual bills, and annual bills) then look for ways to reduce these bills.  Right now I am trying to get Cox to keep my internet bill at $20 a month for the next year.  They told me to call back next week but I already told them that if the bill goes up to $50 a month I am cancelling service (and saving $600 by doing this).Go through all of the clothes in my closet.  My clothes have started to multiply thanks to numerous trips to the Goodwill so I need to purge stuff I don't love or wear regularly.  I will also be getting rid of an entire clothing category (bras and underwear) and replacing all of them.Clean out the refrigerator and clean out the pantry.  Even though we have only been in the house for six months, stuff is starting to get pushed to the back of the pantry never to be seen again so everything will be cleaned out and reorganized and the stuff we probably won't eat soon will get donated to the food bank.Clean out the garage.  Fortunately, since we haven't been in the house long, the garage still doesn't have much stuff in it but things are starting to get set aside in the garage and clutter is building up so we will clean and organize the garage and probably CraigsList a few things.Purge my online stuff.  I keep a list of websites and usernames/passwords on my computer (there is no way I would remember all of these things without writing them down).  I am going to go through this list and delete accounts I no longer use (like Fiverr, Mechanical Turk, etc).\"Pre-stage\" stuff for the upcoming year (like buy a year's worth of stamps before the price increases, buy a couple dozen birthday cards to have on hand for people's birthdays next year, etc).Order my free credit report.  The dust should have settled from buying our house so now is a good time to order my free credit report just to make sure the information on it is correct.Write out a strategy to reach my goals.  A lot of my goals for 2013 can be done with other goals which will save both time and money (like \"walk a marathon\" can be done in Canada the weekend before I leave Canada to ride my bike to Mexico in April since the Victoria volksmarchers are hosting a marathon-length walk then.  On my way up to the Victoria marathon walk, I can arrange the family reunion in Portland which knocks out another goal, then, on the bike ride down the coast I can stop in San Francisco (a goal and it is along the way) and arrange to attend a Jeff Probst show taping towards the end of my ride since this is along the way too.Decide what things I want to change in the upcoming year (my webhost may be one thing, the work I do for clients may be another, etc) then set to work on changing these things."},

The only thing missing this Christmas--besides the big family dinner; we decided to go to the Palms buffet tomorrow and bring one of the cousins.  She hates holidays so I had to bribe her to meet us there by telling her she needs to meet us in order to get the cassava cake and banana bread that she loves...and it worked!--is snow!I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas and if you live in an area that is having a white Christmas, enjoy the snow for me!"},
{"title": "A Quick Update, Some Useful Links, and 10 Things to Do By the End of the Year", "date": "Sunday, December 23, 2012", "text": "First the update:Today was my last day of work! (YEAH!!!!).  For this job I worked a total of 14 days and earned about $650 which is a nice chunk of change for part time work.  Overall it was a fun experience.  It was super busy, the customers were really nice (I think they are nice and happy because everything they are buying costs $1!), and it got me up and off the couch and gave me a bit of exercise. I will definitely do this again next Christmas!I am trying to think of 26 random acts of kindness I can do.  This is an amazing idea and I want to be a part of it especially during the holiday season.My house is sparkly clean.  I came home from work today and cleaned like a maniac because I had put off everything but vacuuming and laundry for the past couple of weeks.I need to get hubby a gift pronto!  Pronto would be tomorrow.  I still don't know what to get him :IHubby paid for my cell phone this month because he didn't want to be out of touch with me for a week so I think I will put off getting my new cell phone for a couple of weeks so I can use up the minutes on my current plan.Then the links:30 Things You Should Never Pay For (I don't pay for most of these things)The High Price of Clutter (So true)Downsizing Your Home May Provide Little Relief (Something to think about)Make Your 2013 Resolutions Come True (I need to tattoo these rules across my forehead!)Diary of an Intensive Care Nurse (Not money-related unless you count the massive savings of compressed morbidity of which I am a fan)And 10 Things I Need to Do By the End of the Year:Our $20 a month intro price for cable internet runs out January 2nd so I need to call and see if I can get the price extended (no way am I paying $50+ a month for internet!).Buy stamps (the price is going up in January).Buy all new underwear and bras (mine are hideous and I have had them for the past two+ years and I am getting rid of all of them and buying all new to start the year...right after I burn all of the old ones...).Sign up for yoga class (I want to try the $40 special for a month of yoga at a local yoga studio and January sounds like a good time to do it.  p.s. it is bikram yoga which I didn't know much about until I Googled it and it seems the 90 minute sessions of yoga are conducted in 100 degree heat!!).Finish up a project for a friend so I can get paid in January (after I enjoy the paycheck from my seasonal job this month I am going to need money next month so I need to get busy and get this project finished).Decide what to do for New Years Eve (and no, we won't be in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip this year...WAY too many people!).See some of the Christmas sights in Las Vegas (I've been so busy working we haven't done much so I want to see the Christmas cacti at Ethel M, the Bellagio Conservatory dressed up for Christmas, and the ice skating on the Strip).Baking.  At least make a pumpkin pie.  I love pumpkin pie but only make them at Thanksgiving and Christmas and even though we aren't cooking this year, I don't want to miss out on this treat.Get haircuts.  Both the hubby and I are getting shaggy and for once I want to treat the hubby to a haircut instead of him always paying for us, plus we might as well start the new year with nice, tidy hair.Go to the movies.  I also want to take hubby to the movies which we can do either this Monday or next Monday (on Mondays movies are $5 per person at the Palms)."},
{"title": "5 Things Friday", "date": "Friday, December 21, 2012", "text": "A quick post before I head off to work...It's the \"end of the world Friday\" and I'm still here.  Glad I didn't buy an underground apocalypse shelter or get a bunch of credit cards and max them out thinking no one would be around to collect on them after today.I almost quit my job yesterday!  I called hubby on my break and said \"I'm going to quit!\" and he laughed (I only have three more days of this job anyway).  But one of the managers was being so mean to my customer that I was going to lecture her about consistency (a customer needed a refund and the assistant manager said no, an hour later another customer needed a refund and the assistant manager said yes, I asked what the difference was and she said she didn't feel like giving the first customer a refund!) and about getting sued and about all kinds of other business practices that were sadly lacking in the store but then I cooled off and figured it doesn't matter and I'm sure they wouldn't care (the regional manager was there a couple days ago on his cell phone going off about things happening in the office and about his coworkers in full hearing of customers so, yeah, trickle down management in action).  So I will go off to work today and be finished with them on Sunday.My cell phone is DOA.  The monthly contract expired today so no service but I am getting a new cell phone and a new plan next week and I don't want to pay for a month on my old cell phone and not use three weeks of it so I decided to just go without a phone for a week (which will be the first time I will be phone-less in years).  Weird.  I'm sure I survived before cell phones were invented, I just don't remember how.We finally broke down and turned on the central heating last night because the house was freezing cold and using a space heater in the kitchen is useless because the house has an open plan and all of the heat immediately goes upstairs.  Bummer :(  I was hoping to go all winter without using the furnace.We have no plan for Christmas.  The family is all gone and we don't really know people here so it looks like it will be just the hubby and I at a restaurant or buffet at a casino.I hope you have a fabulous Friday!"},

{"title": "10 Steps to Retiring (Really) Early", "date": "Sunday, December 16, 2012", "text": "I consider myself pretty much retired these days (I know I am working myself silly right now but it is for a good cause--a cruise--and my attitude going to work is entirely different when I don't HAVE to be there and can quit at any time).  The hubby has been retired on and off since he was 40 years old, and together we have \"officially\" been retired for two years.  Here's how we, and other people I know, have been able to \"retire\" either officially or unofficially, much earlier than what is considered the norm:Be debt free.  There is no other way to retire than to have the most minimal monthly bills possible.  Carrying debt is like an anchor around your wallet and will keep you on the work-spend-work more treadmill forever.Have minimal needs.  There is no way we could live on a small income if our previous \"needs\" (expensive shoes, brand new cars, lavish gift giving, etc) were what we currently consider needs.  Now we need very little to be happy which makes life much less expensive.Have minimal stuff.  The more stuff you have the more it costs to keep, maintain, insure, store, etc.Have a source of income.  For the hubby, he has had a military pension since he was 40 years old.  Now he also has Social Security.  We can both easily live on his income.  Some people have hobbies that could bring in enough of a side income to allow them to leave a \"regular\" job.  Some people have investments that bring in a small but consistent income month after month.Look at your few remaining needs and get creative.  One family I know went camping for three and a half years as they did a 17,000 mile bicycle trip (that saves a TON of money on housing).  Other people live in RVs or boats or in countries where the cost of living is super low.  In other words, the things you thought were necessary for living (like a big house and big utility bills) really aren't necessary and in some cases can be done away with all together.Get in the habit of saving money.  If you retire early you will need a big emergency fund to tide you over in times of disaster.  While your small income may sustain you just fine month to month, the occasional crisis may arise that requires cash and without a steady income, that cash will have to come from your savings.Enjoy the free things in life.  After all, the best things in life are free and free is a very good way to save money in your retirement.  When you are retired you will have a lot of free time.  Often people fill their free time with shopping and buying things but if you want to retire early and on a shoestring budget, free entertainment is the way to go.Realize that retiring early may not be feasible.  There are a number of circumstances that may make you put off retiring simply because too many people depend on your income.  If you have kids or are supporting elderly parents or a disabled sibling, needing a large, consistent income may make it impossible to retire in the foreseeable future.Consider \"mini\" retirements.  There is a new trend where people will take off a few years at a time to travel, write the great American novel, or otherwise enjoy themselves in ways that are impossible with a full time job. Then they will go back to full time work, save money like crazy, then do another mini retirement.Realize that retirement in the future may not look like it did in the past.  Years ago people worked until they were 65 then stopped working completely, collected their pension each month, and lived either frugally or lavishly (depending on the size of their pension) until they died.  Now days people may retire early (either by choice or by circumstance) yet they will dabble at small jobs off and on, for the rest of their life (which makes sense now that life spans are so long...it would be boring if you didn't do anything for decades on end)."},
{"title": "What a Busy Day", "date": "Saturday, December 15, 2012", "text": "I worked today and it was five hours of craziness.  Which is kind of what I expected with there being only ten days left until Christmas.  I think I will skip going shopping until after Christmas (which means I better buy hubby's gift online and do it soon so there will be enough time to have to shipped to me).  The good thing about being super busy is that I think I only checked the clock twice while I was working and a couple of hours had elapsed each time and then before I knew it, it was time to go home!The only sad part of my day was seeing so many young parents with their little kids shopping and thinking that there will be 20 sets of parents in Connecticut who won't be able to do this with their kids ever again (oddly enough I would see the little kids screaming or freaking out and it made me smile because they are alive and healthy).And five other things about the Dollar Store: there is no better place to buy Christmas wrap, bows, tree decorations, etc--everything is $1!  I had hubby come in and shop while he was waiting for me because the store had Thera Flu for $1 (I usually pay close to $4 for the same thing at Walmart).  In the front of the store we sell a bottle of water for $1 but in the back of the store you can buy six bottles of water packaged together for $1.  I see all kinds of new, cool stuff coming across my register belt--Angry Birds toothbrushes, baseball cards, tons of Dora stuff, etc.  Also, I love dark chocolate Raisinettes (just thought I would throw that out there, I buy them every couple of days at the store). Other than that, it is now officially freezing cold in Las Vegas.  Neither the hubby or I want to turn on the furnace to heat the house so we eat quickly in the kitchen then hibernate in our bedroom for the rest of the evening (I mean we have chairs and everything in the bedroom so it is just as easy to sit there and watch TV as it is to do so downstairs but its better to stay in our room because then we only use a small space heater to keep the room toasty warm instead of heating the entire house)."},
{"title": "What a Tragic Day", "date": "Friday, December 14, 2012", "text": "The hubby and I have been listening to the news all morning.  There was a horrific school shooting in Connecticut today.  The first thing I did when this story came on the news was to check where it was happening because my niece is a teacher at a school in Connecticut and we have many family and friends who live there.  Thankfully this happened far away from where our family lives.  What a horrible thing to happen!  I am praying for those impacted by the tragedy."},
{"title": "10 Things I'm Doing Right Now", "date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2012", "text": "Right now, I am...Working. A lot.  I thought I would work at the store through the Christmas season.  What started out as a three day a week gig is now up to five days a week.  How people can work this hard every day is beyond me.  Or maybe I am just a wimp.  But I am not complaining, there is a cruise with our name on it (and a bill for the cruise with my name on it so I will take all the hours I can get!).Freezing cold.  Our nice, hot Vegas weather is now 30 degrees at night. Burrr.I made my list of 2013 goals.  I know, I know, I suck at reaching my goals but this time of year puts me in the mood to set goals.  Maybe because New Years is coming up and New Years equate to new goals.I also moved my blog over to my website to host.  I've tried Blogger for my blog (my other blog, not this one), Tumblr, back to Blogger, and back to Tumblr so now I will see what happens with hosting it with my other website.  tldr; my blogs should come with GPS so people can keep track of them.I'm getting massive amounts of spam on my Blogger blogs.  Don't know why but I do know the spam filter isn't catching it.I am knee-deep in genealogy research.  Among my latest finding: my 10th+ great grandmother Mary Staples and her daughter were accused of witchcraft in the 1600s (two things are interesting here: one, the psychic \"6th sense\" things runs strong on this side of the family, it always has, and two, I thought it was funny that the article says she may have been accused because she was always one to speak her mind, another trait that runs strongly on that side of the family!).  Also, I love it when I type in the name of an ancestor (this is my 12th+ great grandfather in this case) and get a full report all laid out for me!I made sugar cookies yesterday.  Sugar cookies also equate with the Christmas season.We are deciding what to do for Christmas (probably eat at a restaurant as the family is still in the Philippines) and New Years (probably not go to the Strip again, last year was one time too many).I've decided that hubby shouldn't shop without me.  Since I was working today I told him to go to the Goodwill by himself (it's half off day for seniors).  And be brought home a ton of crap.  I told him we already sold all of our crap once, I don't want to have to do it again but he is a packrat and he loves to find good deals.  We WILL NOT end up on she show 'Hoarders'.  I also told him that.  I don't think he got the message.I've got to mail off my Christmas gifts to my friends in Japan tomorrow.  I tried to buy all small, light weight gifts so it won't cost an arm and a leg to mail.  That's my week so far..."},
{"title": "Tales from the Trenches and Other Stuff", "date": "Sunday, December 9, 2012", "text": "I haven't had much to post here because I have been working nearly every day.  Even working just five hours a day really takes a big chunk out of my day (which is a good thing because then I don't shop or go out and otherwise spend money).  Here's what's been happening at work:The people I work with are great.  I realized this yesterday.  I have two bosses, one is an old Russian lady who will say approximately three words per day and even then it seems like she is squeezing her words out between clamped teeth, and another is a big, mean-looking black lady who you can hear all the way across the store.  They are both gruff but nice which I realized is soooo much better than the executives and PhDs I had been working with for the past decade.  I mean, if these people don't like you, you will know it immediately (and loudly and probably in an X rated fashion).  This is a good thing.  I have always hated it when people I worked with were oh so nice to someone and the minute that someone stepped away they would be so caustically vicious about the person that it made me wonder what they said about me when I walked away.  These are the kind of people I grew up with so I am happily in my comfort zone!A skinny little 15 year old guy came in a couple of days ago and bought 21 pregnancy tests.  I try not to comment on what people buy but this one was a challenge.  I wanted to ask WHY? Why why why???We seem to have a lot of financially savvy visitors to Vegas that come into the store and make a haul on snack food, paper plates, soda, etc.  I realized why they did this yesterday when a few people in line were comparing what they bought and both said the stuff was going back to their hotel rooms because they weren't paying the marked up prices that the hotel charges for drinks and snacks.  Smart!This year's theme for little girl's birthday parties--the pricess party.  Nearly everyday a mom and her little girl will come in and end up leaving with the makings of a pricess party--purple balloons, pink streamers, princess dolls, and princess themed everything else.  I haven't seen a trend for little boys.And other stuff:Hubby is defeating the purpose of me working, kind of.  I mean he spends his own money and the money I earn is going towards a cruise but now that I am at the Dollar Store nearly every day so is he...shopping.  He loves the Dollar Store anyway but I pointed out that he can spend what it takes me five hours to earn in about 15 minutes.  EeekkHubby took me out to a nice steak and lobster dinner last night after work which was really nice of him.  It was a promo so each of our meals cost $7.11 but with his comps from playing at the casino it was actually free.  Nice hubby!Finally, I have been emailing back and forth with a distant cousin for a couple of months.  She is an elderly lady that I literally haven't seen in decades but she got my email address when she ran into my sister and we have been corresponding since.  I asked her a question about her grandmother for my genealogy research not expecting much because her grandmother died before she was even born but she said she would send me some things.  A couple of days ago I got a big packet full of pictures from the late 1800s/early 1900s and a ton of information on by grandfather's side of the family which I thought would be impossible to find.  I was soooo shocked (and quite happy). So it pays to ask... BTW, that's one of the pictures up top from 1910 of my great grandparents and great great grandmother.I hope you are having a wonderful weekend!"},
{"title": "20 Things I've Learned from My New Job So Far", "date": "Wednesday, December 5, 2012", "text": "Today was day two of my new job.  Here's what I have learned so far...People buy A TON of stuff from the Dollar Store for Christmas--cards, bells, stockings, chocolate Santas, tree decorations, gift bags (lots of gift bags!), etc. A LOT of people use EBT (food stamp) cards.  They look like credit cards but it comes up on my screen \"EBT card\".  And some of these people are carrying Coach purses and iPhones(!).This store I am working at has a high turnover of employees (it's minimum wage and lots of work so I guess people head for greener pastures or something).  I noticed five employees crossed off the schedule just this week.Overall people are really nice.  Maybe it's Christmas cheer or maybe they feel sorry for us hard working/low wage workers.Some people seem to buy everything at the Dollar Store--like food for a month (one lady I rang up totaled $130--that's 130 items!).I literally have no time to chat with my coworkers.  I am too busy running things across the scanner for five hours straight to do much more than say \"hi\" and \"thank you\" to each customer.It seems like many of the people I work with are young mothers. How they can support themselves, let alone their kids, on minimum wage is beyond me.I had a Canadian couple, a Russian lady, and a German couple come through my line today. All were happy to be in our warm weather instead of the weather back home.I've got to use my Spanish three time so far with customers who didn't speak English.  I haven't had to speak Spanish for two years.  My Spanish isn't very good.I see a lot of things slide across my scanner that I didn't know they had at the store.  I have a marginal urge to shop but that kind of defeats my purpose of earning money to save for my big goals.Sometimes I wonder about the items people buy.  One guy bought rubber gloves, garbage bags, zip ties, and a saw.  Serial killer? Eekk.I am never going to roll my eyes again when I have to wait in a long line at the Dollar Store (or any other store for that matter). Poor pay, under staffed, and scanning as fast as I can go.  Now I appreciate these people who have to do this for a living.This is the most conversation I have had with people in two years!  I've been kind of secluded--in my home, in the library, with the cousins--so I'm kind of amazed at how much I have to talk every day.Hubby came in and shopped today.  He grinned at me as I checked him out.  He still thinks it's funny I am working there.  He should be used to me now--I once did a paper route to get some exercise, I worked in a concession stand at a baseball field because I wanted to be outside in the nice summer weather, and I worked in a library because I liked books.Sometimes I want to lecture people about their health.  I mean they buy a giant bag full of junk food and I want to tell them that if they keep eating like that they will die, but I restrain myself.  The Dollar Store does have the best prices on junk food bar none, however.People buy way more gift bags than wrapping paper.  I think because it's easier and equally cute.One lady asked how I was and I said \"great, happy to be here\".  She said \"at least you have a job\",  She works at City Bank and just got a lay off notice.  I'm surprised at how many people come into the store every day.  A number of people mentioned that they shopped at the store nearly every day. Wow.I am nearly ready to collapse after five hours on my feet.  There is a little old Filipina lady who is my favorite cashier at the 99 cent store and I have no idea how she can work 40 hours a week on her feet.  She has to be more than 70 years old!  Or maybe I am just a wimp.I want to go on a cruise.  I want to go on a cruise NOW.Yeah--tomorrow I get a day off!"},
{"title": "OMG I'm So Tired!", "date": "Tuesday, December 4, 2012", "text": "I started my new job today and even though I only worked for five hours, I'm exhausted!  It was non stop, on my feet, cashiering continuously for five hours (I did get an exactly ten minute break in the middle there but that is hardly enough time to sit down for a few minutes).At least I got the hang of being a cashier pretty quickly--something I hadn't done since I was in college decades ago.  And I have a new respect for people who have to work on their feet all day!  Eight hours would have killed me!But I am really happy to be working.  My coworkers are nice and the customers were all nice too even though I messed up a few times.  The manager asked me if I could work an additional shift this week and I said sure--I am so focused on taking hubby on the cruise, that I will take any hours they give me.  As I told hubby when he came to pick me up this evening, I've haven't worked this hard for such little money since I was in high school, but any money is great at this point.  If they keep me on past the holidays I will then start earning money to put towards my summer bike trip followed by our trip to the UK in September and our trip to Asia in October.  I really hope I can earn enough to pay for all of these vacations since hubby has been so great about supporting both of us for the last two years.  If they don't keep me on past the holidays I will apply at other nearby places for work (I love the fact that I can walk to work in the bright sunshine in the middle of December!). On another happy note, my friend from Washington called yesterday and asked me if I could do a project for her so that will net me an additional $500 (it's much less work for lots more money but these projects only come up occasionally).  Hopefully these projects will keep coming in too.  All money is good money!"},
{"title": "And Yesterday We Went...RV Shopping", "date": "Sunday, December 2, 2012", "text": "They just happened to have a big RV show here this weekend so I just happened to drag hubby there.  I know we have only lived in Vegas for a year and have only owned our house here for six months but I am so ready to sell everything (house and all, again) and move.  While Las Vegas is a great place to visit, even live in for the winter, I am not really a fan of living here full time (I know, I probably should have brought this up before we bought the house but we were so excited to get a super cheap house here that it kind of slipped my mind). I think that living in an RV would be perfect.  We would own very few things (I am such a minimalist; this sounds wonderful to me), and best of all, we can change location any time we want.  Seattle for the summer, the southeast for the spring, the northeast in the fall, and Vegas in the winter.  That sounds perfect to me!Hubby is less than enthusiastic.  His current answer is no way, he loves Vegas and he loves our new house.  So, like any other time I want to get my way, I used logic: living in an RV would save a lot of money, we could see the kids and family more often, we could get out of Vegas during the super hot summer, we would have very few bills...etc.  He still said no way but he did like looking at the RVs so that may be a start.  Since housing prices are increasing in Vegas, it may just be a matter of time before we end up living in an RV.  Especially if prices go up so much that we could sell our house and pay cash for the RV.  I will continue to work on the hubby when it comes to this issue.Of course we won't be buying the above RV.  $300,000 for an RV kind of defeats the purpose of living cheaply, but it is nice to dream.  These super fancy RVs have washers and dryers, gas fireplaces, side by side refrigerators and even ceiling fans!  The RV we can afford would be considerably smaller and considerably less fancy.  But we are hardly home anyway--we are always out and about--so this won't matter much.  Plus we had an RV years ago and we really liked it (we couldn't afford it and so it often sat in the driveway while we worked to pay for it, but we really liked it).One thing that makes me think this could really happen is that I was reading my blog from a little over two years ago and noticed that we had no inking that a couple of months later we would be in the process of selling our house and nearly everything in it so who knows, we may be \"full timers\" sometime soon!"},
{"title": "A Bicycle and Other Stuff", "date": "Thursday, November 29, 2012", "text": "Yesterday we made our usual trip to the Goodwill (and our usual haul!).  Hubby found this bike for $25 and promptly snapped it up.  Plus he bought a couple dozen--name brand no less--shirts for 50 cents to $1.50.  I swear he is never shopping at a retail store again.  We were at Ross a few days ago and he didn't even look at clothes proclaiming that all the clothes he needs can be found at the Goodwill and for much cheaper than any other store sells them.And other stuff:I was able to buy the \"uniform\" for my new job--black pants and a green polo shirt--for $4 total at the Goodwill.I decided not to interview for the crossing guard job because we will be taking a two week cruise in the early spring plus be leaving in mid May for the bike trip so I didn't want to commit to a job then leave them hanging which wouldn't be a very nice thing to do to them or to the little kids that would be counting on me to be there.This was a good post: 10 Habits of People Who Are Well OffTomorrow is our anniversary!  26 years! Wow!  I'm still waiting for a check that was supposed to come in days ago which is what I was going to use to take the hubby out for lunch tomorrow so we may end up eating at a casino (free) instead of Fogo de Chao ($75).  But then again that may be OK since we were discussing whether we really wanted to spend $75 for lunch when we have more important goals so that money may in fact end up in savings."},
{"title": "10 Things I Love About My Minimum Wage Job", "date": "Tuesday, November 27, 2012", "text": "Well I can't actually say I love the job yet since I haven't started, but here are ten reasons why I didn't turn my nose up at the job because it \"only\" pays minimum wage:I can walk to work.  If the job was across town I may not have taken it because gas or a bus pass or commuting time or (horrors) the need for a second car just to get back and forth to work would have made this job equate to a lot less than minimum wage.I get some exercise.  Because I do a lot of my freelance work sitting at the computer, my butt is getting wider by the minute.  I love the idea that I will be on my feet doing physical labor for four to six hours a day (plus the walk to and from work).  It's way better than paying for a gym membership and it's way better than relying on my own motivation to get me out and exercising.There is no dress code.  Actually the manager said I need to wear a dark green shirt and black or khaki pants so I will hit up the Goodwill tomorrow--senior 50% off day--and pick up these two items for a couple of bucks.  I literally cringe when I think of the gobs of money I spent on my professional wardrobe when I had my business.  I was Macys' favorite customer and even got an \"exclusive\" credit card because I spent so much money there.  I wasn't exclusive, I was an idiot.  At this job there is no pressure to dress better than everyone else or to have the latest purse/heels/etc.  Thank goodness.I have no kids to get a sitter for.  I seriously don't know how single mothers working minimum wage jobs do it.  If you have to pay a sitter these days where the going rate is $8 an hour if you have a couple of kids, you would come out in the minus if you work a minimum wage job.No office politics.  Well I assume there may be some but I am hoping it is much less than at high pressure, professional level jobs.  I have Aspergers so I really don't understand office politics to begin with.  I was fortunate that by being self employed before I pretty much shielded myself from office politics at the businesses I worked for.  I'm hoping people at this job people just want to go and work and go home and skip the drama.It's part time.  For people who need a job this is a troubling trend.  Many businesses want to keep their workers at part time so they don't have to pay benefits which is a terrible thing to do to people who need to earn as much as possible but for me this works out fine--I want to work a few hours a day then go home not slave away for eight hours a day.It shouldn't be boring.  This store is always packed with shoppers when I go there plus the store always looks kind of messy and disorganized (I hope to remedy that) so it doesn't look like the workers will stand around and be bored which is perfect for me.  I once got a high paying, much sought after job basically handed to me by a friend but after three days I announced that if I had to be this bored every day for the rest of my working life I would die.  So I quit.  Everyone was shocked but I just can't be bored no matter how much I am getting paid.I may come to appreciate the effort it takes to make the money I am earning.  I was looking for my social security card yesterday and came across our tax forms for the last decade, some of which showed six figure earnings.  I didn't appreciate it when I was making a lot of money.  I spent nearly every penny I earned on a whole bunch of stupid stuff and just assumed I would always simply earn more so there was no need to appreciate it and/or spend it well.  Sad.I can treat the hubby.  The hubby has been awesome about supporting me the last couple of year (which I tell him.  Often.).  And while he will not say no to any purchase I want to make, I don't really ask for anything because I know we are living on a limited income and the money has to come from somewhere so I am loathe to even buy a pair of shoes if it will cut into money already earmarked for something else.  With a little extra spending money I can \"treat\" us to various things that we don't have the money for now--new smartphones, a cruise, etc.This may inspire me to earn even more money.  Based on the 'objects at rest tend to stay at rest, objects in motion tend to stay in motion' theory, I am hoping that this small money-earning venture will inspire me to continue seeking ways to make even more money (notice how lazy and uninspired I was with my aborted November money challenge?).So those are the things that have been churning through my mind.  Of course I will give you an update next week when I will have some actual experience to speak from."},
{"title": "It's Raining Jobs...And Other Info", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2012", "text": "So I carted myself over to the Dollar Store today (it's only a 15 minute walk in the sunshine which was awesome!).  And they hired me!  It sounded like the manager was trying to talk me out of working there but I was super excited about working and the manager gave me the job (\"are you sure you want to work here, it's seasonal...are you sure you want to work here, it's only part time...are you sure you want to work here, we only pay minimum wage...\"  Yes, Yes, and Yes).  So I start next week.  I'm not sure if it helped that all I put on the application was \"self employed\" and \"office work\" for work experience because hubby said that if I put my actual work experience down they wouldn't hire me.  And it worked, so I may do this if I apply for any other job as well.  It sounds like the job is only part time and seasonal so they may not keep me after Christmas but like I told hubby, any money is good money because I WANT TO GO ON A CRUISE!  So my goal this month is to gather up enough money to book a cruise and pay for the airfare to get to and from the departure port.Then when I got home from getting this job, a lady from another job that I applied for almost six months ago called me to see if I was still interested.  It was for a school crossing guard position and it sounded interesting--two hours a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, helping kids cross the street before and after school, and they pay $22 a hour!  So I told the lady I was still interested and have to go in for an interview on Wednesday.  It would be great if I could do both jobs!Hubby is just shaking his head over the whole thing.  He can't imagine why I would take such jobs but it totally makes sense to me--I don't want a business (too much work and requires 24/7 attention) or a \"good\" job that has a lengthy hiring process and lots of stress (office politics, high pressure, etc) when I may quit because we want to head out and travel so these kinds of simple jobs, even if the pay isn't good, are flexible enough for me.Now I am inspired to hammer away at making enough money to accomplish at least two of my four goals for 2013--going on a cruise and riding my bike from Canada to Mexico.  I am really trying to convince hubby to let me rent out our two guest bedrooms on AirBnB which would bring in even more income but so far it is a resounding no--he doesn't want strangers in our house and he has heard horror stories about CraigsList so, um, no way.  So far.  I'll keep working on him.On a kind of related note, I read this post on Carla's blog which, aside from paying for the things to reach my goals, is pretty much the only reason I am working.  The hubby and I can live quite well on only his income but there always seems to be things that come up (like the *newest* cell phone, and *new style* purse, etc) that I want to spend money on.  I've pretty much got over upgrading to every new item that comes down the pike but there are still things I want.  My cell phone, for example, is a very old style and while it does what it is supposed to do--make calls, make text messages, access the internet albeit very slowly--I really want a new Samsung Galaxy S2 phone (especially now that Walmart offers a $30/month plan.  That's what I pay now and I wouldn't be paying any extra with this new phone but I have to pay full price for the phone since it isn't on a contract).  Plus I want to buy hubby a new phone, and treat him on our anniversary...and there is always something new to buy.  But at least I am not as bad as I used to be with buying the latest styles, the most expensive purses, the newest technology, etc.And then I read this post which kind of summed everything up.  And while I have pretty much stopped shopping, I haven't given it up completely so I do still need to make some money and I am looking forward to earning enough money to buy a few of the things I want (once I do this, I then want to save up enough money to pay the few bills I pay each month--cell phones, grandson's school, etc--for a year and put it aside in savings)."},
{"title": "I Think I Got a Job!", "date": "Saturday, November 24, 2012", "text": "I wasn't really looking for a job although I do have four (very expensive) goals for 2013 that I want to complete.  And I was getting kind of discouraged because I had applied for a few jobs since we moved here and didn't even get an interview so I had pretty much resigned myself to being jobless for the rest of my life (dramatic, I know).  Then today the hubby and I were shopping in the dollar store and the manager was ringing us up and I mentioned that it was super busy at the store.  She said yeah we really need to hire more people because it is always like this.  So I said \"hire me\" and she said \"seriously?\" and I said \"yes, I really want to work\".  So she said to come in on Monday.  I will need to talk to another manager but she said to be ready to work so I think I may have got a job (I won't know for sure until Monday but I am definitely ready to work). Even though it only pays minimum wage it is a) more than I am making now on a regular basis, b) near enough to our house that I can walk back and forth to work, c) something to do so I am not bored silly, d) gets me around people instead of staring at the four walls at home, e) it is a simple job that I won't have to worry about--no payroll to cover, no pressing projects to worry over completing, etc, and f) will make me enough money to at least pay for the first goal which is to go on a cruise (right now I am looking at a 14 day Southern Caribbean cruise in February or March).  So I am super happy and I hope I get the job.  As an added bonus, I won't be tempted to spend my paycheck there (I had applied a while back at a clothing store but the possibility of wanting to spend my paycheck on discounted clothing probably would have been pretty great and it would torpedo my main purpose for working which is to gather up enough money for my goals).So yeah, I'm kind of excited today!"},

{"title": "Are You Lining Up for Black Friday Sales?", "date": "Tuesday, November 20, 2012", "text": "Besides the fact that \"Black Friday\" is actually falling on Thanksgiving Thursday (which I don't agree with), I really can't see why people would start camping out now--like camping out in a tent for days on end in front of a store--just to save a bit of money on a TV.  I used to head out early on Friday morning more for the spirit of the whole thing (wake up early, get some hot cocoa, hit the store at 0 dark 30 with friends) but ever since people have started acting like stampeding cattle (and even KILLING people) in their quest to save money I have pretty much sworn off Black Friday shopping.  Even getting through the stores today for our weekly groceries was an exercise in patience (or the lack thereof) as everyone and their brother was out shopping for groceries as well.  Eekkk   I'm getting too old for all of this craziness.  So we will go out for dinner on Thanksgiving (fortunately in Las Vegas EVERY restaurant/casino/etc is open with specials for Thanksgiving dinner) and stay home on Friday. No driving, no shopping, no fighting the crowds.  If I do find something that I really really need (doubtful) I will shop online as they are supposed to have the same Black Friday sales online as at the brick and mortar stores.  And some suggestions for everyone:Only buy what you can afford (in cash, and not with credit!)Consider the cost of shipping if you will be mailing presents (ie: buy small gifts, it will save you money on shipping)Be careful! (people will literally trample you or pepper spray you just to get to a sales item--crazy, I know)Remember, it is the thought that counts, you don't need to \"prove\" how much you care about someone based on the cost of your giftsScale back on the number of people you buy gifts for (once you and your siblings have a couple of generations following you, the number of gifts for family members grows exponentially)Consider giving experiences instead of things (memories will last much longer than socks or a tie)Consider having an anti-consumer ChristmasFinally, if you must shop, consider using a variety of apps to get your shopping done on time and under budget"},

In other news:I decided not to go to the Twilight movie marathon today because I seriously couldn't see myself sitting still for TWELVE hours of movie watching!Be careful this holiday season!  This sad story was on the news today.  Either it is a big city thing or a people are desperate thing but when some people see the goodies you are buying for Christmas they may be inclined to rob you or burglarize your home.  Scary!In other blog news I noticed my blog visits dropped significantly yesterday but when I checked Blogger this seems to be an issue that was recently fixed so hopefully that little problem will be taken care of.Adsense revenue also seemed to drop dramatically so I'm not sure if it had something to do with the site counter being off or people getting ready for Thanksgiving so visit are dropping or my blog feed being messed up...I don't know. I sent my friend in Japan a birthday gift today and the cost for mailing alone was $17.95 and the gift was pretty small!  I'm going to have to think of something else for Christmas because it is ridiculous to spend so much on shipping.  I wonder if Starbucks gift cards work in Japan?  I will need to check that out.I think we are making an impromptu Thanksgiving dinner for the cousins this weekend.  Some are heading for the Philippines next week and a few are coming in this weekend from out of town so someone said \"hey let's have Thanksgiving this weekend!\"  So we will cook.  If there is one thing hubby's family is good at, it's changing plans on a dime.  But after this many years I am used to it and have learned to go with the flow (in most everything else I like to plan...a lot...).  It's like this with reunions too, a group of 30 people will be heading out to the cars to go to somewhere and plans can change between the house and the driveway!On a happy note, the weather in Las Vegas is perfect in the fall/winter!  High 70s and sunny today and while it is a little chilly at night, that's what blankets are for.  No wonder my grandmother used to head to Arizona every fall and not return until spring.  Now that I am getting older I appreciate the warm weather much more than before!"},

{"title": "How We Cut Our Coffee Costs By 80%", "date": "Tuesday, November 13, 2012", "text": "For someone who doesn't like coffee, our (mostly my) daily cost for coffee products was outrageous.  Over the past month we have reduced this outrageous amount from $150+ per month to around $20.  Whew!First, me:  I have never drank a cup of actual coffee.  The taste is too bitter and I can't get past the first sip or two of black coffee.  But, I love coffee drinks like frappuccinos at Starbucks and the Baskin Robbins Cappuccino Blast.   So apparently I can stand coffee if it is swimming in cream and fat.  Don't even get me started on the caffeine kick which is immediate and overwhelming (a frappuccino at noon will keep me awake until 3am). This habit started about four or five years ago when the girls from work and I would hit up Starbucks every single morning before meetings and on occasional afternoons on the way back from meetings.  At the time I could afford it (I couldn't afford the calories but that is another story) and it got to be such an ingrained habit that even after I was no longer working I would seek out Starbucks or Baskin Robbins nearly everyday no matter where I was.  The caffeine was not good for me and when I was no longer working, the expense went from a blip on my financial radar to a big deal but, alas, I was addicted.  After we got settled in Las Vegas I cut my daily Baskin Robbins addiction down to every other day, mostly to save money and also because having caffeine every day was literally making me ill.  At $5 a pop, my coffee habit was still expensive.  About a month ago the hubby and I were talking about our bills in general and he said \"you know going to Baskin Robbins every other day costs more than going to a show and dinner every month\".  Wow.  He was right.  So I changed my habit (I don't drive by Baskin Robbins every day) but I kind of kept my addiction.  Now every week or so I buy a half gallon of coffee ice cream at the store, add it to milk at home, and 'ta da' instant coffee milkshake at a fraction of the cost.And for hubby:  Hubby plays poker with his old poker buddies every day.  He has separate funds for this (his entertainment allowance) and is really good about not spending more than is allotted for playing poker.  Fortunately he is also pretty good about winning (yeah hubby!).  But, his habit was to order coffee from the waitress about four times a day.  Even though the coffee is free, he still tipped the waitress $1 for each drink delivered so the cost was about $4 a day.  On top of that he would use instant coffee at home because it was \"easy\" but then again, it was also expensive (those little tins of International Coffee really add up and he would go through about one tin every four or five days!).  After having the cousins over a couple of times for dinner, and seeing that one cousin would literally carry her coffee pot and coffee over to our house because she really has a caffeine addiction, we decided to buy a coffee pot and some \"real\" coffee ground.  We realized it really wasn't so hard to make coffee and about a month ago, I started making hubby coffee each morning in the coffee pot.  Then we picked up one of those big insulated portable coffee mugs with a cover at the Goodwill so now he brings his own coffee to the casino.Overall I figure we have changed our coffee habits and went from spending about $150 on coffee each month to spending about $20 which is a huge savings.  It also cuts waste (we aren't throwing away disposable cups a half dozen times a day) and it actually seems to be a bit healthier (kind of.  At least we know what we are drinking and it isn't full of chemicals)."},

that military members receive.  Most are well known in the military community, some, not so much.  I was fortunate to marry into the military via the hubby many years ago.  Until that time I knew absolutely nothing about the military or any of the great benefits it offers.  Remember when you read this list, however, that while they may seem like great benefits (and they are definitely money savers for the most part) these guys (and gals) earn these benefits--deployments away from the family for a year at a time, cancelled days off, working in harm's way, lots of moving, little to no say over where you are going or what you will be doing, etc. can really cause a lot of strain on the military members and their families.The commissary.  The commissary is a grocery store on the military base which, for the most part, has lower (on occasion MUCH lower) prices than the off-base grocery stores.Medical care.  One of the best military benefits available is the nearly free health insurance provided to active duty military, retirees, their dependents, and reserves.  Years ago the program was completely free.  These days there is a monthly fee (about $50 a month for the hubby and I) which is still exceptionally low compared to civilian medical insurance programs.Additional medical service.  There are some additional medical services that can be had for veterans who would otherwise receive their normal medical care through their regular physicians such as glasses and hearing aids provided by the VA hospital. Prescriptions.  The military medical system offers an excellent prescription program.  Of course you need to get the prescription from your doctor, but by submitting the prescription to the base pharmacy you can get many common prescription medications for free or only a few dollars.The Exchange.  The exchange (PX, BX, NEX) is a department store located on the military base.  Besides being tax free, some (not all) of the prices are lower than what you can find off base.Education.  The GI Bill is a well-known program that helps current and former military members pay for college.  There are also educational assistance programs as well as scholarships for the spouse and children of military members.  A new program allows for the military member to transfer their GI bill credits to their spouse or children.Entertainment.  Most military bases offer a range of free and discounted entertainment.  Our last base had a library, roller skating rink, movie theater, fishing, shooting, golf course, swimming pool, gym, tennis courts, bowling alley, and ceramics/crafts workshop as well as night clubs and restaurants.Recreation.  Many bases offer a range of recreation options from guided kayaking tours to outdoor gear rental to RV parks and camping facilities.Child care.  Many bases offer infant, toddler, and school-age care on base and at a discount from what off base providers would charge.Family services.  Most military bases offer a range of family support services.  These services can range from individual and family counseling, moving assistance, the ombudsman program which is the liaison between the family and the deployed family member, financial counseling, spiritual counseling, assistance with special needs family members, and social service advocacy (domestic violence, child abuse, etc).Lodging.  Many bases offer \"hotels\" for visiting military members and their families.  These can be anything from reinvented barracks to new buildings created specifically to house travelers offered at lower rates than what you can find off base.Space A travel.  If you have the time this is a great way to travel for $15 to anywhere in the world that the military flies.  This means that you basically wait until there is space available on a plane (after cargo and military members traveling on orders), pay your $15, and go.  The down side is that you may be waiting for ages in a foreign country at peak travel times.Life insurance.  Military members get a sizable life insurance policy included for free with their benefits, while dependents and retirees can join for a small fee.Off-base discounts.  Many stores and businesses located near military bases offer discounts for military members with ID.  Generally they give 10% off a restaurant meal or off the price of the items you bought just by showing your military ID.Special discounts on Veteran's Day.  As this list shows, there are a bunch of discounts for the military on Veteran's Day.Red Cross assistance.  The Red Cross is well known for helping military families in an emergency.  Through one program they will help a soldier \"get home\" during a family emergency by acting as the liaison between the military member and the doctor of the ill family member.VA home loans.  We have used this program a couple of times.  This program offers $0 down mortgage loans and it also waives some of the closing costs for active duty and retired military members.Death benefits.  When an active duty or retired military member dies, the military provides a one-time death benefit payment.Vocational assistance.  Once out of the military some members need help transitioning to the civilian work force, the military offers this assistance for free.Benefits for spouses and family members of deceased veterans.  There is a host of programs to help the spouse and children of active duty and retired military members when they pass away.  A pension.  Retired military members get a pension for the rest of their life after retiring from military service.Discounted meals.  All active duty members receive free or discounted meals at the base galley; retirees and family members are usually also given discounts on galley meals as well.Housing.  As part of the active duty package, military members receive a stipend to cover their monthly housing expenses.  On some bases, retirees are allowed to live in military housing at a discount.Disability payment.  Military members who were disabled during or related to their military service receive an additional payment along with their monthly pension.Special assistance programs.  There are a number of programs geared to current and former military members including a suicide helpline, substance abuse programs, and PTSD programs.Special pay programs.  While all military members receive pay based on their rate and rank, some military members receive additional pay for being in combat zones or for having high risk jobs in the military.Tax breaks.  Military members who are deployed to combat zones get special tax breaks from the IRS.Small Business Loans.  The SBA offers special loan programs for military members and veterans.Veteran's preference for jobs.  There is a special classification for veterans which gives them \"preference points\" when it comes to hiring for some types of civilian jobs.Debt collection protection.  The Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act allows for deferred debt collection when military members are deployed.Foreclosure assistance.  A new program assists military members who are dealing with default and foreclosure on their home.Assistance with unreimbursed medical care costs.  The Veteran's Aid and Assistance benefit provides additional funds to cover a range of unreimbursed medical care costs.Legal assistance.  The base legal office can provide a number of legal services for free to active and retired military members including Wills and Power of Attorney documents to divorce and probate services.Tax services.  Each year you can usually find free tax preparation services offered on many military bases.Cosmetic surgery.  This was a benefit I just learned of today while researching this post but apparently cosmetic surgery is offered at military hospitals.  Interesting.Discounted franchising opportunities.  VetFran assists veterans with buying into franchise businesses.State veteran's benefits.  Each state offers their own benefits to it's veterans.  Here is an example from Alaska but you can also check with your state office of veteran's affairs to see what benefits your state offers.Airport USO services.  Many airports offer USO services to active duty and retired military members.  This can be anything from a free meal and wi fi service to free overnight lodging while waiting for your next flight.Non profit veteran's services.  There are a number of non profits that provide services and support to veterans including the VFW, USO, NMCRS, AFAS, etc.Voting assistance.  There is even a program to help military members vote (which can be harder than it sounds when you are deployed or moving around quite a bit with your job).Veteran's nursing homes and residential care.  The VA offers a range of nursing home and residential care options for retirees who can no longer live at home.Auto hobby shop.  Many bases include an auto hobby shop where you can work on your own car, buy auto parts at a discount, or even take classes on how to fix your car.Base community services. Many bases offer a range of businesses and services just like you would find off base such as a post office, veterinary clinic, barber/beauty shop, fast food restaurants, flower store, dry cleaners, bank, gas station, liquor store, etc.Banking services.  There are a handful of banks that cater to the military population including NFCU and Armed Forces Bank.Free National Park Pass.  The National Parks Service provides free annual passes to active duty and (at age 62) to retired military members.Discounted tickets.  Many tourist attractions offer free or discounted tickets to military members.  These range from Disneyland to pro baseball tickets to lists of discounts by city.Store and other discounts.  A giant list of other special discount programs for military members can be found here.Special laws for service members.  While rare, there are a couple of laws that were made that pertain specifically to protect service members such as this one and maybe this one (I haven't heard much about this one recently, however).Citizenship.  While obtaining US citizenship can be difficult if not impossible, the US government offers expedited citizenship and other services for US military members.Other travel benefits and discounts.  There are a number of other discounts and freebies available to military members which range from free camping to discounted airlines tickets and/or free baggage to the Armed Forces Vacation Club."},
{"title": "10 Things...An Update", "date": "Friday, November 9, 2012", "text": "Here's what's happening today...My November challenge has come to a screeching halt.  I'm just not motivated.  The book is bleh, the money earning is practically non existent, I like exercising but I am not consistent with it, and we have been hitting activities when available but not every day.  Ugh.And then I read this post which was inspirational. And then I read this post which helped to adjust my attitude; it made me realize that part of my frustration is that I should be more grateful for what I have, that I do love stuff to some degree, I am so not patient, faith in myself wans when I don't get instant results, and that I need to work smarter.And finally I read this which really put everything into perspective.On a happier note, this is a great post about how a family cut their debt and paid cash for their (tiny) house.I think hubby needs a dog.  He is up to five fish now plus he is feeding the pigeons on our back deck every morning.  Maybe a dog would make him happy.  Although we agreed that with traveling plus the fact that it is literally too hot to walk a dog three months out of the year here it may not be such a great idea.  I still think he needs a pet that can be a bit more responsive than fish and birds...My favorite TV shows: Tavis Smiley (best interviewer on TV), The Jeff Probst Show (soooo inspirational!), and NOVA Science Now (amazing and informative).There's a lot going on this weekend so I'm sure we will hit up a few interesting activities including a Veteran's Day parade, the Pro Bowling Finals, and maybe even the Beard and Mustache Championships.There are few movie theaters that will be holding a Twilight Movie Marathon in honor of the newest Twilight saga movie release next Thursday but I am still trying to figure out if I can sit and watch five movies one right after another--that 637 minutes of movie watching!!We aren't cooking for Thanksgiving.  Last year we did a big dinner for all for all of the cousins but they all decided last week to go to the Philippines for the holidays so it looks like the hubby and I will just eat out."},
{"title": "Day 7 of My November Challenge (and some Goodwill Goodness)", "date": "Wednesday, November 7, 2012", "text": "The challenge was uneventful...no exercise, no money earning, no activity, but I did get one more chapter of the book edited.  I suck at challenges.  :( What we did do today was to get the hubby some new pets......the bowl was from the Goodwill (99 cents), the rocks were from the $1 store ($1), the plant we had, and the fish were from Petco (97 cents for all three).We also made a haul from the Goodwill--for $24 we bought 9 shirts for hubby (photo below--great brands!), and a pair of jeans and a long-sleeved shirt for me. Right after I decided not to watch the election counts yesterday and while I was still reeling from finding out that a friend may end up in federal prison, another friend called because she had a client who needed to file some back taxes.  I still get calls all the time for help with all kinds of things (helping people was what I did in my previous life) so this is nothing new.  I thought that my \"things that are going to shock me today\" quota had been used up yesterday but apparently it hadn't been because when I asked what forms the person needed, she said \"all of them\".  For the last six years.  Yikes.So here is the spiel I gave her about taxes:Always file your taxes on time each year even if you can't pay them.  There is a financial penalty for paying your taxes late but there is also a penalty for not filing at all so at least you can avoid one penalty by filing on time.If you can't file on time for whatever reason, file for an extension then be sure to file your taxes before the extension expires.You can do your own taxes by going to www.irs.gov and pulling up the forms and instruction you need for this past year and for previous years.You can also do your taxes online which is even easier because it takes away the need to do all of the calculating.  Just enter your information and it is all figured out for you (I always do my taxes online at H & R Block).  I'm not sure if you can file back taxes through such a website.If you are totally overwhelmed, a good tax preparer can be totally worth the money.It is sooo much easier when you keep good records.  And this doesn't have to be difficult.  Even a simple Excel spreadsheet where you record expenses and income can be super helpful when it comes time to prepare your taxes.So once you have filed your taxes and can't afford to pay what you owe, now what?  After you file, give the IRS a couple of weeks to process your taxes and then give them a call and ask to make payment arrangement.  The IRS does this for millions of people; they want to help you be able to pay your taxes so they are pretty good about making payment arrangements that you can afford.If you are completely buried in back taxes owed there is the option to make an offer in compromise or to have the debt totally written off.  I have heard that people have filed for both OICs and write-offs themselves but I would probably recommend having a professional (tax accountant/attorney) do this for you.What happens if you don't file or don't pay?  For starters the IRS probably won't forget about you if they have any documentation to show that you have earned money and not paid your taxes (they get the info from your employer who files their own taxes which show that they paid you).  It's a bit more tricky if you are earning money under the table but it isn't impossible for the IRS to figure this out.  Once they calculate how much you owe, they can garnish your wages as well as any other future income you may receive   You can even end up in jail (Al Capone got away with quite a bit of nastiness but he ended up in prison for tax evasion...the IRS doesn't mess around when it comes to getting their money!).Hopefully the client will get their whole tax mess straightened out.  It can seem pretty overwhelming when one missed tax filing snowballs into a multi-year mess but it is totally worth it to get the mess cleaned up as soon as possible."},

OMGHubby is happy.  Three of his \"on hold\" movies at the library came in so this evening he will enjoy 'Hunger Games', 'It Had to be You', and 'What to Expect When You're Expecting'.  Glad some new movies came in as he has seen nearly every other movie in the entire library system."},

Yeah!Daily goal 2--make money.  Fail!  I was going to make another cooking video with the hubby and so we taped the prep work last night but in the middle of cooking today the battery on the camera died :(  Unfortunately we couldn't stop the cooking until the battery got charged so today's video was a fail and we will have to redo the recipe again sometime.  Note to self, charge camera before use.Daily goal 3--exercise.  Yes!  I felt bad about not exercising at all yesterday so when I went to do my errands this morning I decided to walk instead of drive.  Hubby walked with me to a shopping center a little more than a mile from our house where I got my haircut and went to the bank.  I still haven't been able to talk hubby into cutting my hair.  Maybe next time.Daily goal 4--activity.  Hubby took me to the movies today.  At the Palms Casino they have a $5 special all day on Mondays so we watched 'Taken 2' for a total of $10.  On the rare occasion when we go to the movies we try to hit up matinees and senior days at the movies but since seniors are $4 (hubby) and regular matinee price is $8 (me), today's $5 special was the cheapest way to go.  Good movie too.And here's some links:15 Possible Reasons Why You Are Always BrokeThe Ultimate Guide to Traveling When You Have No MoneyHealth Law Spurs Shift in Hours (this is terrible!)Living on One Income"},
{"title": "Day 4 of My November Challenge (And Some Tech Info)", "date": "Sunday, November 4, 2012", "text": "...can be summed up in one word.  Fail.Daily goal 1--work on book.  Didn't do this.  Bummer.  But I will do chapters 4 and 5 tomorrow so I can catch up.Daily goal 2--make money.  I uploaded hubby's first cooking video today.  I seriously need to learn how to edit video!!  I gave it a shot and it could have been better but every time I tried to clip out a few frames that were unneeded it would delete the whole segment!  Eeekk  I also linked the YouTube channel with Adsense but I think it will take 24 hours to kick in.  What I really want to do is devise enough sources of passive income so that I won't need to go out and seek work to do and get paid for, kind of like this lady.Daily goal 3--exercise.  I know I should have at least went out for a walk but I was lazy and didn't.  Bummer.Daily goal 4--activity.  We stayed home all day so didn't do any kind of activity (unless cleaning up the garage counts, which it doesn't).So basically that is what I did all day, which wasn't much.  When were were cleaning up the garage, hubby's daughter called and said she needed a laptop for her son and it just so happened that we found an old laptop (circa 2005) in a box in the garage so I spent hours--literally--updating it.  Here's how I take an old computer and make it newish again:Turn it on and hook it up to the internet.Go to 'add/delete programs' and check what programs are on the computer.  There was some pretty old software still on this computer as well as other obsolete programs which I uninstalled.Go to 'Windows Update' and see if there are any updates for the computer (there were 75 so it took ages for all of the updates to load!)After all of the updates load, turn off then restart the computer then hit windows update again.  Sometimes needed updates won't show up until other updates have been installed.Delete anything else off the computer that you don't want there (in this case there were a bunch of old picture and music files which I already have on my new computer so all of these files got deleted as well).Get on the internet then go to internet options then click on 'delete'.  You have the option to delete browsing history, TIFs, etc.  I deleted everything.Then I reset the home page to a generic page (Yahoo.com in this case) instead of the homepage I use.Next I emptied the recycle bin on the computer.Next I turned off then restarted the computer just to get all of the changes settled.Then I went to start, all programs, accessories, system tools and did a disc clean up then a disc defragment (this takes forever!).Finally, I installed some new software they might like at www.ninite.com.  In this case I chose the Chrome browser, Skype, VLC, LibreOffice, Avast, and Ad Aware.So while I didn't do a whole lot today, I still feel relatively productive!"},
{"title": "Day 3 of My November Challenge", "date": "Saturday, November 3, 2012", "text": "Daily Goal 1--work on book.  I was hammering away on chapter three and determined that chapter one needs to be \"catchier\".  Chapter three is updated, chapter one needs to be redone. Ugh.Daily Goal 2--make money.  First thing this morning I set up a YouTube channel for the hubby.  The channel will feature him cooking all of his yummy recipes and I will be able to monitize it and generate some ad revenue.  Then we got the camera figured out, then I found that the best free video editing software (Windows Movie maker) is already installed on my computer!  Tomorrow hubby will make his first video and we will go from there.  Also, today we \"found\" $150!  Yesterday on the radio I heard an advertisement for our credit union that said you can earn money from the points you earn when you use your credit card.  Hubby hasn't used this card in ages (yes, he still keeps one credit card although I have tried many times to get rid of all of them but he rarely uses it and if he does use it he pays it off right away).  I think the last big thing he paid for with the card was our tickets to Asia last year because he said that would be safer than using our debit cards to pay for such a big purchase.  So I told him this morning that he should check and see if he has any points just for the heck of it and it turns out that yes, he had points that he could redeem for a $150 Visa gift card!  Which he promptly did.  We figured that the points have been adding up for years and we didn't know anything about it.  That was a really nice surprise!Daily Goal 3--exercise.  The hubby and I went to the local outlet mall.  It is a huge mall and it is indoors which is nice so we walked around the mall for about two hours...and didn't buy anything!  Yeah!Daily Goal 4--activity.  The World Series of Bowling is in town this week so we stopped by to check out the action.  It was free (yeah) and we were also able to pick up free tickets for the finals next weekend (double yeah).  Hubby was happy about this activity because we used to own a bowling pro shop and he knew a lot of guys from the tour 20+ years ago.  We were pretty surprised to see about a half dozen guys that we knew way back then are still professional bowlers!"},

A while back I had told a friend to host her website with this company and since then I have been getting affiliate income from her each time she renews her hosting plan.  So while I basically did nothing to earn money today, I have earned a total of $232.85 on day one!  (And a note on webhosting:  you will see the affiliate ad at the top of this page.  This is the company I have used to host my websites for over ten years.  Up until this year they hosted my low traffic sites for free and I only paid for my high traffic sites but--and you may remember the rant--they raised the price to $150 a year for hosting recently.  I was taken aback by the change but then I looked around at the alternatives and realized there is no such thing as free webhosting any more.  I also realized that $150 for an unlimited number of websites hosted--unless the traffic is kind of high at which point you pay for more bandwidth--was a pretty awesome deal.  They also have a $100 coupon for this fee if you are a new client (see ad on their home page), plus the customer service can't be beat (any time I call I usually talk to Wayne and he doesn't even hesitate when I tell him I messed up a site so completely that I want him to delete all the files and let me start all over...I've done this a few times.  They were also really great when I was overseas and a hacker brought down two of my sites--all I did was call and they deleted the hacked sites and re-uploaded the original files stored on their server.  So if you need a great webhost click the ad above!).Daily Goal 3: Exercise--there is a new park near one of the major casinos here in Las Vegas so the hubby and I went and checked it out.  They have an amazingly huge walking path (it's circular and about the size of three football fields) so hubby and I walked the path and enjoyed a bit of exercise.Daily Goal 4: Activity--we went to a free 'Dia de los Muertos' community event.  Unfortunately I didn't check the time so we were really early and they were just setting up but we checked it out, talked to some people, and I took some photographs.  The actual Dia de los Muertos holiday is tomorrow so if you have the opportunity to visit one of these fun community events, give it a try!  Even though the holiday celebrates those who have died, it is a festive atmosphere with vendors, music, food, entertainment, and interesting shrines to the dearly departed.  Fascinating!And a really good shopping find!As we were coming back from the Dia de Los Muertos event we saw a huge Latino grocery store so decided to drop in.  We were shocked that their prices were so low!  For $9.27 we got: a pineapple, four apples, 2 pounds of jalapenos, a bunch of cilantro, five onions, four limes, five cucumbers, eight tomatoes, a half pound of cheese, a baked bun, and a cream filled bun (not in the photo because I ate it before we got home!).  Needless to say, this store is going to be on our Wednesday shopping rounds from now on."},

{"title": "30 Ways to Make Extra Money", "date": "Monday, October 29, 2012", "text": "For the month of November, my challenge is to make $2000.  Since I don't have an actual job, the challenge will be even more difficult because I have to devise ways to make money AND earn what is a pretty substantial pile of cash.  Here's 30 ways I came up with to generate some extra income:Sell stuff on eBay.  I still have a few Coach purses that I never use and a few other things that could bring in some cash.Sell stuff on CraigsList.  We have the cute chairs that we trash picked a couple of weeks ago which could be sold and a few other items that could be sold as well on CL.Buy and resell things like Lorraine does.Sell gold and jewelry.  I did this a few years ago and made a lot of money.  I don't have that much jewelry left that I don't use but there is a bit so I may check into this.Pick up some gigs on CraigsList (unfortunately many of the gigs are kind of skeevy but there may be a few legitimate ways to make money).Generate money from some previous clients by writing grants and doing other small jobs for them.Increase my Adsense revenue.  It has gone up a bit over the past couple of months but maybe I can make it go up even more.Do a bunch of promotion for my book so I can increase sales (so far sales have been very small but then again, I haven't done any promotion at all).Entertain people on the Las Vegas Strip for tips.  Unfortunately it is now illegal to sell water and other items on the Strip but entertaining people is still allowed.There is a lab here that pays people to be medical guinea pigs.  Sounds scary to me but...well, maybe.Sell blood.  Unfortunately my blood has never been that great so I'm not sure if it would be sell-able but many people do this to earn extra cash.Have a garage sale.  We don't have much to sell yet but this is a pretty popular way to earn money in our neighborhood--a few people do this EVERY weekend.Go trash picking and dumpster diving; this would give me things to sell.Put up a sign at the library and become a tutor.  Many people seem to be doing this at our local library.Trim shrubs.  We were going to pay a service $30 to trim the shrubs in our yard but they didn't show up on the day they said they would so hubby took the $30 and went and bought an electric shrub trimmer and we did the job ourselves.  It was pretty easy and I see a bunch of neighbors who could use this service.Sell a website.  I have one website that could be better monetized.  If I sell this I may be able to make a good amount of cash.Do some more freelance webdesign work.  I know a guy who owns a hosting company that asked if I wanted to do some extra work for him so I may give him a call and take him up on the offer.Rent out our extra bedrooms on AirBNB.  Hubby would probably not like this idea very much but it could bring in some extra cash.Take pictures.  I read an article recently (sorry can't find it) where people get paid to take photos for Google places.  I happen to live in a very photographic city.Make a YouTube channel for hubby about his cooking and make some ad money.  He is an amazing cook and people are always asking how he makes certain recipes.I love to bake.  I realize there are a lot of regulations when you want to set up any type of food sales but maybe I can bake some stuff and sell it to hungry kids at the local university.Sell stuff on the side of the road.  People seem to do that a lot around here with rugs and other things. There are lots of vacant lots near the city and they just seem to set up shop one day then are gone the next.  I could buy produce/other stuff wholesale and sell it.Walk people.  Everyone walks dogs but I haven't heard of anyone walking people.  I like to walk and other people say they need to walk more so I could show up and \"walk\" them everyday.Take surveys.  I tried the online survey thing which didn't work out very well but the other day I did a quick survey at Walmart and made $5.  I can find a local survey company and sign up to do their surveys for cash.Be a Vegas tour guide.  I live in a very touristy area so could easily find great things to show people.Buy $5 pizzas from Little Caesars and sell them at the university for $10.Rent out my cousins condo.  Our cousin has a condo that we lived in before we moved to our house.  She doesn't rent it out because it is a hassle so it just sits empty except for the couple of months a year that she comes to Vegas.  I could rent it and share the profit with her.Freelance writing.  I've done this in the past but one of my favorite places to write for changed their format.  I would need to find other places that pay for freelance articles.Collect bottles and cans then drive to the California border and sell them.  We don't have a recycling program here that pays for bottles and cans but they do in California which is a short drive away.Sell my photos on Shutterstock.  I just found out about this service and I have a ton of photos I could sell."},

{"title": "My November Money-Earning Challenge", "date": "Saturday, October 27, 2012", "text": "Actually I have two challenges for the month of November. The first is to enter the RWA RITA contest which means I want to completely finish a novel I have been working on for ages by the end of November.  The novel is nearly finished but it needs significant polishing.  Also, with this contest, entry applications are due by the end of November but the actual manuscript doesn't have to be submitted until the first of January.  But, since November is NaNoWriMo, I figured now is as good a time as any to finally get this book done.My second challenge is to earn enough money during the month of November to pay for our February cruise and airfare which I estimate to be around $2000.  Since it really doesn't look like I will be getting an actual job, that means I need to get busy making money in a variety of other ways.  I did this challenge a year or so ago and really surprised myself with how much money I was able to make so hopefully it will work out well again.  Since I have been building websites all day (and reading teeny tiny code) everything looks practically blurry so I will have to lay out the details of my challenge tomorrow.I hope everyone is having a great weekend and if you are on the east coast, batten down the hatches and BE CAREFUL!"},
{"title": "20 Things I Don't Scrimp On", "date": "Friday, October 26, 2012", "text": "While we were shopping the other day I picked up some maple syrup which we were out of.  When hubby saw the price he just about choked.  But I explained to him that I don't mind being frugal with many things, but there are a few things I just don't scrimp on.  Here's my list of those items:Maple syrup.  The real stuff.  Yum.Honey.  Unpasteurized, straight from the hive, with honeycomb.Ice Cream.  No el cheapo ice cream for me--I want the good stuff!Butter.  No margarine for me either; I'm a fan of butter.OPI Nail polish.  It just works better than cheap nail polish.Pilot Precise V7 pens.  Yes I could buy 10 pens for a dollar but I am really picky and like having good pens and this is the best I have found (it just doesn't fly well).Knives.  There is a HUGE difference between a $10 knife and a $100 knife.  I like the $100 knife better.Pots and pans.  Again, you can get a complete set of pans for $25 but you will hate them.  A quality set of pots and pans makes cooking a very happy experience.Paint.  I learned this lesson the first time we painted our house so many years ago.  The cheap paint we bought took three coats to look OK whereas more expensive paint only took one coat.Travel.  I know people who travel super cheap but if I don't have a clean, safe hotel room or an ocean view cabin on a cruise ship I am a very cranky traveler.Shoes.  I used to be this way about purses but purse contents can be tossed into any bag.  It isn't the same with shoes--I want my feet to last a very long time so I have switched to \"old lady\" shoes that make my feet happy instead of expensive yep crippling shoes that look cute.Chocolate.  I am a big fan of quality dark chocolate.Tools.  Again, when you have used dollar store tools then switched to Craftsman tools there is no going back.  I love tools.  Quality tools.Rice.  There's cheap rice and there is quality rice and I know the difference.  I love a good Jasmine rice.Paper.  I have a bunch of notebooks and I am just infatuated with paper so I am really picky about the look and feel of any paper I write on.Potato chips.  I have tried a bunch of \"cheap\" potato chips from the dollar store but there is a big difference between those off brands and higher costing name brand potato chips.A mattress.  If I am going to spend a third of my life sleeping, I want to be able to get quality sleep and this requires a good mattress (hard, not soft, no pillow top).Business cards.  While I don't use these much any more, I still insist on having quality business cards.  Cheap cards make a bad first impression for your business.Legal counsel.  While I have only needed legal counsel a couple of times, I prefer a clever pit bull over a lazy lap dog when it comes to attorneys.Experiences.  I will happily buy my clothes at a thrift store but I don't scrimp on paying for experiences.  Making memories is well worth the money.What are things that you won't scrimp on?"},

Yeah!On the job front:  I got an email from the library which said that after reviewing my application I was not chosen for the interview process.  I'm kind of bummed but it is probably a sign that I need to come up with something better in order to earn an income (and really, punching a clock gives my hives).In weird news: one of my sisters texted me this morning and said 'call me--I just talked to mom'.  Considering my mom died over ten years ago, that got my attention and so I called her right back.  Turns out she found a psychic online and paid her $90 for a phone reading.  I think I know what my next business might be..."},
{"title": "Another Clever Hubby Trick...And Other Stuff", "date": "Tuesday, October 23, 2012", "text": "I have a habit of ripping paper towels right down the middle so I only use half of it.  This instantly saves money by giving me double the amount of paper towels in the roll, but when you look for these \"halved\" paper towels in the store, they cost a lot more than your basic paper towel, thus negating any savings that could be had.  Hubby saw me doing this the other day and the next time I came into the kitchen I noticed he had taken a big, sharp knife and cut the entire roll in half down to the cardboard tube (don't cut the tube or it won't hang on the roller!).  Clever huh?And some other stuff:I'm in the middle of remaking all of my websites with WordPress.  I'm kind of getting the hang of it and while I think I can create better looking sites with my (expensive) web design software, I think WordPress will be better because it is free (important), and it is web-based meaning I don't need to have the software on my laptop (when I travel I want to bring only a smartphone or iPad-like device with me so I will be able to update my websites on the fly with a WordPress app).  Hopefully my design skills will get better with practice!This is the first story I read online this morning and it really made me want to sell our house and everything in it--again--and hit the road!I'm annoyed with our HOA.  I've never lived in a place with a HOA before but it seems quite common here in Vegas as it looks like the city/county has turned over their responsibilities to these associations (no idea why).  Anyway, the HOA management company keeps sending me the bill for our monthly HOA fee on the 27th of the month but payment is due on the 30th.  So for the last four months I have been calling them and asking them to send the bill to me with a reasonable amount of turn around time and they don't seem to want to.  As of yesterday, the office wouldn't even give me the name and contact info for the HOA president or tell me when and where the next HOA meeting is!  So now I am annoyed and I will escalate this to the county's HOA ombudsman.  If this doesn't work, I will call a local TV station's consumer reporter and get them to add this place the their \"HOA Hall of Shame\".  Can you tell I'm annoyed?Other than that, Las Vegas in the fall is awesome.  While my friends in Seattle are enjoying weather that is 40 degrees and raining, it is a perfect 80 degrees and sunny here.I haven't got a call back about any of the job applications I have put in.  I fear that I am unemployable.  I may need to start my own business again but I really didn't want to do that much work :IInstead of spending $20 on a haircut, I am trying to talk hubby into doing it (he is artistic and creative and I know he could do it).  So far he is refusing.  I'll let you know if he changes his mind :)"},

So the hubby and I have decided to try to go there every other year if possible to visit everyone.  This time I will leave hubby at home while I go to Japan and we will meet in Manila (last time we flew to Manila and I left him there for a week and he was bored because the few people he knew there had to work so he stayed in the hotel playing poker on his computer for a week.  At least at home he will have his regular schedule to keep him busy).So that's the plan.  Achieving these goals will cost a small fortune which means I better get busy making money...cash only you know..."},

And a cool thing I learned about banking:  I now have a local bank but I got a check from one of my clients and I wanted to put it in my other account in my bank in Washington.  This usually involves endorsing the check then putting a note on it that says it needs to be deposited into my account, then mailing it to my bank.  I saved myself the cost of a stamp and envelope yesterday because my bank now has a way to scan the check and edeposit it into my account.  And it worked!"},
{"title": "What am I Going to Do When I'm Old?", "date": "Saturday, October 6, 2012", "text": "This is one thought that has been swishing around my mind lately.  I feel much more financially vulnerable since I haven't worked in nearly two years so this thought has given me some concern.  Here's the problem (in bullet points, of course):I don't have a pension, an IRA, or a 401k.We are living on hubby's pension and Social Security plus my freelance income right now.Since I have been self employed for nearly 20 years it has been my responsibility to set up some kind of retirement account for myself (which I haven't done).Hubby is 20 years older than me.I won't qualify for Social Security for another nearly 20 years (and I highly doubt it will be there in another 20 years).The military has a life insurance plan but we opted out of it when hubby retired (I was 20 at the time, what did I know about life insurance?).I believe that if he passes before me I would receive some sort of survivor benefit of about $50,000 (I definitely need to research this).If I go before him then no problem(!).Right now if we want to get term life insurance policies for us it would be pretty expensive.I have seen a half dozen women in similar situations when they came to me for help after their husbands died and they had been homemakers with no job skills.  They were too young for Social Security and their kids were already grown so they didn't get any income on behalf of the kids when the wage-earner died.  These women have ranged from destitute and homeless to owning some assets but having no income so they had to liquidate their assets (like a house) in order to have any money.I don't want to be homeless and destitute and widowed and hopeless!Of course I can work which would give me a bit of financial security (but with having no retirement plan I will be working for the rest of my life! eekkk).I could start saving money right now in an IRA.  But according to this retirement calculator, in order to have $1 million dollars at retirement at 65 I would need to contribute nearly $27,000 per year (!!!).I have no kids (and wouldn't feel right imposing on my step kids or nieces and nephews to take me in when I am old).Gah.  I may end up like the 75%.  A couple of things in my favor:We own a house.  It remains to be seen if it becomes an asset or a liability.I can live on very little income.I am not opposed to doing this.Or this.Yikes!"},
{"title": "10 Tips to Afford (Nearly) Anything You Want And/Or Reach an Amazing Goal", "date": "Friday, October 5, 2012", "text": "I just came across this really interesting post about how this guy can afford to travel nearly continuously (to date he has been on the road for 4,660 days!).  Many of the ways he sustains his lifestyle are things that we did as well when we decided to do some long term traveling.  Note that you don't necessarily need to focus on travel as these tips will help you achieve nearly anything else you want (a killer tech set up, a job better suited to you, opportunities to do amazing things, etc).  Here they are:Set a goal and focus on that goal, regardless of what other people think.  Here's another blog post where he sets a goal and people think he has lost his damn mind (I'm sure people thought the same thing about us but were too polite to say anything).  By focusing on one big goal instead of a hundred wildly varying goals you can focus all of your energy on achieving what you set out to do.Don't get caught in the numerous consumer traps that keep you on the hamster wheel of \"normal\" life.  This means stay out of debt, stay out of long term contracts, don't shop every weekend to reward yourself for working at a job you hate all week, don't buy a huge house with huge house payments, pay cash for a used car instead of buying a new car on payments, etc.Do buckle down and work like a maniac in order to make \"gazelle intense\" strides to achieve your goal.  When we were a few months out from selling our house and paying off the last of our debts before we hit the road, every day was a flurry of activity.  Besides working crazy hours in my business I was also getting my non profit ready to turn over to others, we were selling everything of value on CraigsList, holding garage sales every weekend, packing things for storage...it was a crazy, intense time but it had the affect of propelling us much further and much faster towards our goal.Change your life to suit your goal.  It would have been impossible for us to do any sort of long-term travel if we still had a huge house, a huge house payment, a half dozen cars, multiple creditors, full time jobs, and all of the other trappings of normal life.  We took a look at our goal (long term travel) and then got rid of anything that 1) didn't fit with long term travel, and 2) wouldn't enhance our goal.  If you don't have a house or a house payment you can do a lot of other things with all of the money you are saving (or on the flip side, you won't need to earn nearly as much money because you won't have nearly as many bills).  We also figured that since we would be traveling we would be using public transportation a lot so what better way to \"practice\" than to get rid of all but one paid-off car and take the city bus instead (BTW this saved a TON of money).Develop multiple sources of income.  Most people have one 9 to 5 job that accounts for all of their income.  This is good but it doesn't lend itself to some goals (like long term travel) and if you lose that one all-important job you will be in a very difficult situation.  Like the guy in the blog post, we \"launched\" ourselves into our goal of long-term travel with a small amount of money (hubby's small pension).  Since then hubby's Social Security has kicked in, we traded babysitting for five months for room and board, I have been able to do a bunch of freelance work--from writing to web design, some of the people I worked with in my old life have hired me to do projects, and most recently I published a book (which, unfortunately, doesn't look like it will bring me much income but it was a fascinating experiment nonetheless).Save up for the things you want.  This was a hard-learned lesson for me because for most of my life, I just bought whatever I wanted then paid for it later.  When you have a huge goal, you can't mortgage your future for something that you want right now.  You need to plan and save and then buy the thing you want.Make tiny steps towards your goal every single day.  Some days it seemed like we were in quick sand.  We weren't making strides towards our long-term travel goal and sometimes it seemed like we were actually going backwards (in between working and saving and paying off debt Murphy would occasionally show up and throw a wrench into our plans).  But every single day we persevered, even if the only thing we did was check our passports and note the expiration date or scan our important documents into the computer.Don't give up before you get started.  Many times the goal is so overwhelming that it is easier to just throw in the towel before you even begin.  I mean, you will come up with so many excuses (some valid, some not) that really, only a crazy person would continue on in the face of such adversity.  Here's an excellent article on this topic from the Family on Bikes who accomplished an amazing goal. Don't give up before you reach your goal.  Here is another post from the Family on Bikes where they were so close to reaching their goal but still felt like giving up (reaching a giant goal can be physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing and again, it may seem easier to throw in the towel than continue).  But don't throw in the towel, keep going!!!And some other tips:  Face the fear but continue anyway.  See how other people reached their goal.  Make your own rules.  Don't wait until you have \"permission\" to be what you want to be.So my question to you is:  What is your big big big goal?  Are you taking steps towards it (and what are those steps)?"},
{"title": "Five Things...and a Recipe for Flan", "date": "Wednesday, October 3, 2012", "text": "First things first...I am SO happy that my friend was successful in court today.  For 13 years he has been in court, defending himself against criminal charges in one of the weirdest cases I have ever seen (the prosecutor \"lost\" the evidence and a few months later it miraculously appeared, the prosecutor added parts to the evidence to make it more illegal!?  The case was dismissed over and over only to have the prosecutor refile the charges again and again hoping for a different outcome...).  Scary stuff but he prevailed so I am happy!Something I should have read before I wrote my book (it wouldn't have changed the outcome but this was an informative article). p.s.  I have found that I am horrible at self promotion!This was a nice article.  I think I shall do a spending fast in the near future (I need a vacation so I need to save money for our next vacation).The party went great yesterday.  I estimate that we spent about $75 on the food and everyone had lots of leftovers to take home (hubby cooks enough for an army every time he cooks).  Sorry I didn't get any pictures but everyone started eating so fast it looked kind of icky to take photos of half eaten dishes.I have kind of decided that I will probably never be a full time writer but I am working on polishing up one more manuscript to enter it into this contest.And here is the super simple recipe for flan that I told you about yesterday.Caramelize one cup of sugar in the bottom of a pan (this pan should be able to go into a double boiler).  You can see in the photo above that I don't really have a double boiler, I just use two pans that fit together which allows me to put water into the bigger pan then put the smaller pan inside of that.  The point is that when cooking a milk thing--this recipe uses a lot of milk products--cooking it directly on the burner would scorch the milk so cooking it over water is how not to end up with a scorched dessert.  To caramelize the sugar just put it in the smaller pan directly on the burner then stir and stir until the sugar melts and turns brown.  Be careful not to get any of this on you because it can cause severe burns (this is just like making candy apparently).  After the sugar has caramelized, put it in the bigger pan which you have part-way filled with water (this stops the sugar from continuing to cook and harden a bit).  Be sure to not put too much water in the bigger pan or it will overflow when you set the smaller pan into it.In a blender mix 4 eggs, one can of sweetened condensed milk, one can of evaporated milk, and one teaspoon of vanilla together.Pour this mixture over the caramelized sugar and cover.Bring the double boiler to a slow boil and cook for about an hour and fifteen minutes.  Remember to keep adding water to the big pan so it doesn't all boil away.  The finished flan should be set and not runny.  Allow to cool.When the flan is cool, run a knife around the edges then put a pie plate upside down over the pan.  Flip it over so the flan lands nicely in the pie plate (this was my problem yesterday...it didn't land nicely).  Refrigerate for a couple of hours before serving.It will be difficult to clean the pan because the caramelized sugar will stick to the pan like glue.  What I do is add some water to the pan and bring it to a boil, scrape a bit, then dump it down the drain.  This heats up the sugar enough to release from the pan with the least amount of effort."},

Mi libro es publicado!  Seriously, I have no idea what is wrong with my blog so keep and eye on this space, I may be switching over to blog.com soon.On a happier note, I think I have everything done for my book to be published, both the paperback version on Amazon and the Kindle version.  I believe it will take about 48 hours for it to actually be listed so my project for today is to finish the website for the book and make a Facebook page for it.  I am also going to order about 20 books and have friends in Washington shop them around to various bookstores, Chambers of Commerce, tourism organizations, etc.  I need to develop a guerrilla (read, free) marketing program! p.s.  When the Amazon link goes live I will of course post it here.Another project for this week is having a \"going away\" party for one of the cousins.  She comes to Las Vegas for a few months each year and on Wednesday she will be heading home so we told her and everyone else that we will have a party for her.  The only problem is that this is a tight month financially (we paid a year of house insurance, six months of car insurance, gave money to one of the kids for house repairs, and we live on a fixed income!) so our budget is stretched super this this month but since we set up the party, we need to pay for all of the food for the party.  Yikes.  So we are putting together an inexpensive menu and I will blog about our success (or lack thereof) next week.  Have a great Sunday!Another p.s.  If you have ever had the idea of writing and publishing your own book, I highly recommend that you do so.  It is such a cool experience and these days you don't have to suffer through rejections from multiple publishers...just write and self publish and it really is as easy as that!"},

{"title": "7 Days of Super Cheap Meals", "date": "Tuesday, September 25, 2012", "text": "Over at r/frugal, people are always trying to come up with ways to stretch their food dollars.  Off the top of my head, here is a week's worth of super cheap meals:Breakfast:Oatmeal with raisins, cinnamon, and milk.Eggs and toast.Tortilla with scrambled eggs and jam (is tastes better than it sounds!)Homemade granola with milk.Sandwich (egg salad or fried egg or meat from the night before, etc).French toast and eggs.Homemade biscuits with meaty gravy (sausage and gravy, chicken and gravy, beef and gravy, etc).  Lunch:Sandwich with meat left over from last night's dinner.Homemade chili over rice.Homemade pizza (it's easier to make than it sounds).Gyro (any kind of meat, vegies, homemade yogurt dip, on a pita which can also be made at home).Soup and salad.Leftovers from the night before.Big salad with tuna or chicken and lots of vegies.Snack:Popcorn.Fruit (apple, pear, watermelon, etc)Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.Piece of cake (making a sheet cake from a mix at home costs less than a $1).Tortilla chips and homemade salsa.Cheese and crackers.Fruit smoothie.Dinner:Curried vegetables with a bit of meat (beef, chicken, shrimp) over rice.Tacos or burritos (home made of course).Stir fried vegies with a bit of meat over rice.Rotisserie chicken from the store with vegies made at home (mash sweet potato, beans, corn, etc).Chicken pot pie (homemade of course).Meat/pasta/vegies put together in a casserole. Home made stew with biscuits or dumplings.  Note that one rotisserie chicken from the store is usually cheaper than buying a whole chicken in the meat department and this one chicken can be used for a half dozen meals.  Eggs are also a great cheap source of protein.  Grains are often used to stretch meals (anything over rice looks like a feast) and meat can be served in small pieces (diced, etc) to make it stretch.  Finally, cooking from scratch can save A LOT of money and it will probably be healthier for you (there aren't any added chemicals and preservatives) plus once you get in the habit of cooking from scratch it really does become easier and faster (the first few times you try this it may be more difficult and slower but that's the learning curve!)."},

{"title": "20 Ways to Be a Rockstar", "date": "Friday, September 21, 2012", "text": "I just sent off for the review print of my book and can hardly wait to receive it--an actual book with my name on it!  So I am feeling a bit like a rockstar, not because I think the book will make me famous but because I can't believe I followed through, from beginning to end, on such a big project.  Which got me to thinking that everyone has a \"rockstar\" inside of them, you simply need to let it out.  And I think part of the secret is to not actually aim for being a rockstar but to do something you love so much (and do it in a big/public/audacious way) so that it won't matter if you become rich and famous from doing it--you will be happy that you actually even did it.  Here's 20 ways that other people have become \"rockstars\" by doing things they loved in a big, public way.  And yes it needs to be public because no one is going to know that you are an amazing writer if no one other than your mother reads what you write and no one is going to know that you are an amazing singer if you only sing in the shower.Go on a reality show like Carrie Underwood did (here's one of her videos; warning it's really sad!).Make a video and post in on YouTube.  Charice and Justin Bieber did and it changed their lives dramatically.Write a book and publish it yourself.  Amanda Hocking did and she is now a well respected, best selling author.Or you can blog about your passion (which helps many other people learn to live their passion) and become a rockstar in your own right, like Chris did.You can also set a big, fat, hairy challenge for yourself...and complete it.  And turn it into your life's work like this family did.You can see a problem that needs to be fixed, dive in, work tirelessly, and pretty soon you may have a huge non profit that help thousands and thousands of people come out of it.Or you can take a personal problem (cellulite in this instance), find a way to fix it (actually hide it), and turn into an \"overnight\" billionaire (especially when you can fix the same problem for millions of other people).You can set a big money goal--something that most people would give up on before even starting--then bust ass to reach it.  This can change your life.You can see what \"everyone\" is doing then do the opposite, like Dave did, and he become a personal finance rockstar.You can use your genius to create a huge success story for yourself (and help millions and millions of people in the process) like Bill, Mark, and Steve did.You can throw in the towel, in a unique and never been done before way, and reap the rewards like Ian Usher did.You can turn a hobby into a successful business like this lady did.Or you can pick one of your random, completely off the wall ideas and turn it into a book or a movie.One of the themes that seems to run through all rockstars is that they set goals then go out and do something about them, like these guys.They don't wait until the \"right\" time (ie: stop making excuses that you are too old or too young or too poor or too busy or the myriad other excuses you would use to stop your dreams in its tracks).And they don't wait for the \"proper\" credentials, they just go and do (well, unless you want to be a doctor or lawyer or other professional that requires actual credentials).They also take some risks--both financial and personal--to achieve their dreams.And they push through fear to achieve their goals like this lady did.One of the biggest barriers to becoming a rockstar is changing your habits (after all if you keep doing what you're doing, you will keep getting what you are getting).Another barrier is people thinking that you are crazy for not being \"normal\" (for most people \"normal\" means you are fat, broke, up to your elbows in debt, and living a life of quiet desperation...don't be normal!!).So the Reader's Digest version of this post is: go out and DO something; take risks, push through your fears, don't follow the crowd but follow your own drummer, ignore what your pessimistic mind and others tell you when it comes to \"that can't be done\", and live your passion.  Go!  Go now and start!"},
{"title": "All I Know About CreateSpace...So Far", "date": "Thursday, September 20, 2012", "text": "Whew!  I finally got my book set up to publish on CreateSpace today.  Finally!!!  So far this is what has happened (and what I've learned):This is the easiest self publishing process I've ever seen (it's actually the only self publishing process I've ever seen but it is so super easy that I was really surprised).I wrote my book over the past few months.  It took a ton of research.  Thank God for Google.I then signed into CreateSpace and was able to choose the finished size of the book I wanted (it will be a travel guidebook so I wanted the shape to be conducive to travelers) along with the already formatted template which saved me from trying to figure out margins and all that stuff.I cut and paste my manuscript into the formatted template.  Then had to reformat it (twice) so that it looked right.  I then proofread the book.  Twice.  I have the sinking feeling that I still missed things and I really should have had someone else proofread it but I was in a hurry to get it done and didn't want to pressure anyone to quickly proofread the book.Fortunately I did the index in an Excel file as I was writing the book.  Having to index after the fact would have taken forever.  I did have to go back through and proofread the index as well as tweak it so it would fit within the margins of the template. I then uploaded my 5x8 templated manuscript into the 5x8 book format and was promptly told that my margins were wrong (I believe it was because the book was so big--350 pages--that it needed more margin on the bound edge).After stressing about having to change the margins and reformat the book again, I decided to change the size of the book to 5.5 x 8.5 which seems to have worked!CreateSpace does not like my Chrome Browser so I had to do all of this on my old laptop which still has the IE browser on it.Next I had to create the cover of the book.  Fortunately CreateSpace has a cover creator feature which allows us non artistic types to create an OK cover for the book.  The cover I made is nice enough but not amazing (the cover creator feature doesn't allow a lot of design changes but I was a bit freaked out over making and uploading my own cover in Publisher because I am seriously not good at visual design stuff).I then set the price for the book.  I checked Amazon for similar books and set the price at $12.95 which is about what similar books cost but because the book is so big I will only make about $2 in royalties for each book.  Lesson learned.I declined the feature which allows the book to be sold through expanded distribution channels such as through Barnes and Noble and to wholesalers that sell to libraries and independent book stores.  The cost was $25 for this feature (everything else so far to this point is free) but since the book is of such limited interest--you have to be in Washington State for the book to be useful--I kind of reasoned that selling it just through Amazon would be fine (I may be wrong).I next need to get the book set up for Kindle which was a task I have no energy to do today so I will work on that tomorrow.Now I am waiting for an email which says the book is ready to go so that I can give it a final preview before I send off to have an official printed copy of the book made (an ARC, advanced reader copy) in order to do the final final run through before I officially put it up on Amazon.I can totally see why it would be nice to have an agent and a publisher so that people who know what they are doing could do all of these things that I have no idea about but it is a good learning experience.  I actually don't think this book will be anywhere near a best seller--it is very location specific and I have no idea if people will think the book is interesting or useful but just getting a book bound and printed with my name on it will be a huge accomplishment.Next step--publicity!  Again, I have no idea how to do this  :I"},

{"title": "I'm Publishing a Book...And Other Updates", "date": "Thursday, September 13, 2012", "text": "It's busy around here!First, and most importantly, I have jumped into CreateSpace and I am thisclose to hitting publish for my book.  There's a bunch of stuff to do after you write a book in order to get it launched and I am still in the beginning phase of the whole thing but so far I have reformatted the book so that it will look better, set up my CreateSpace account and set up some of the basics for the book, reserved my domain name and hosting for the website for the book, created a website for the book that is nearly finished, and now I am re-reformatting the book to fit into the template for the size of the finished book that I want.  Yikes!  I think it is much easier to do this when you have a publishing house backing you up but I didn't want to a) wait (because I am really impatient), and b) schlep the book around to publisher after publisher getting rejection after rejection.  Plus I think that the do-it-yourself process--even if your book doesn't become as successful as it might have been with a real agent/editor/publisher--really teaches you all of the \"behind the scenes\" stuff about publishing.  This way I am not only a writer but a book editor (and you know how well I edit my posts here on this blog :I ), a book publisher (yikes), and a PR machines for the book (double yikes because I'm not that outgoing and social...but I will give it a try anyway).  Next up I need to design the cover for the book, figure out how to get my Excel index into the body of the book, set up a Facebook page for the book, then hit publish and wait (impatiently) for a proof of the book to arrive.And five more things:Four ways we have saved money this week: I stay home each day instead of going with the hubby which saves gas (when I drop him off I usually go to Starbucks or the library or the mall, most of which cost me money and gas), we paid our car and house insurance in a lump sum for the year (there is a discount for this which you don't get if you pay monthly), we have ate out once this week instead the two or three times we usually do, and I found a discount coupon for my old webhost so I am sticking with them for another year (if you follow them on Twitter you get $100 off their hosting plan; this plan gives me free hosting for all of my smaller websites so its quite a bargain). Yesterday hubby picked up 13 nice, name-brand shirts from the Goodwill for $23.  We figured this was a savings of around $350 over buying them at a department store. We were super fortunate that our house was high and dry during the recent flooding that happened in Las Vegas.  Here's a picture of the UNLV parking lot.Thank goodness it's fall--temperatures are in the mid-90s now instead of the 110s! The iPhone 5 came out yesterday which has sparked another round of \"cell phone envy\" in me.  I really really want a smartphone but after comparing prices between the \"free\" phones you get when you sign up for a two year plan with a wireless carrier and the prepaid plans which require you shell out the money for the phone up front there is no comparison--you save a ton of money with the prepaid plans even if you have to pay $200-$300 for a nice cell phone.  So I'm saving my money for a nice smartphone as soon as I can afford it.And one more thing...I've found a new favorite romance author. Since I've read everything by my other ten favorite romance writers I had to find someone else to read (I can read about 200+ pages in an evening and my favorite authors can't write that fast...I have to give them time to catch up!) so I stumbled upon Lorraine Health's books and now I am voraciously reading through everything she has written.  And she is really good!"},
{"title": "My Hubby is Also Clever", "date": "Monday, September 10, 2012", "text": "As you saw in the last post, hubby likes to hang onto his money (definitely a good trait!).  Fortunately he is also clever (which also saves money).We have this big wok which the hubby uses when he cooks for parties.  The problem was that he didn't have a lid for it.  We have some big stainless steel bowls which he has used a couple of times to cover whatever is cooking in the wok but then he has to do a \"flippy\" thing with the tongs to lift it up then catch it with a potholder since he can't pick it up because it is too hot.  So we headed to the place where we bought the wok and looked for a lid.  We found the lid but it cost $14.95!  Needless to say we didn't buy the lid.  Instead we went home, hubby got one of the big metal bowls he was using for a temporary lid, cut off a small section of a wooden dowel that was left in the garage, then promptly screwed the piece of dowel to the metal bowl thus making the perfect wok lid!  See photo of hubby's cleverness above.p.s. The only time I don't appreciate his cleverness is when we buy an item that needs to be put together and it comes with instructions of how to put said item together and he still thinks he can figure it out better sans directions.  I draw the line at that."},
{"title": "My Hubby Has Turned Into a Miser and Other Stuff", "date": "Saturday, September 8, 2012", "text": "Actually I need a better word than miser because he is in no way stingy or greedy but we were at Ross yesterday and I found it funny that years ago he wouldn't have shopped anywhere but Macys, Nordstrom, or Bloomingdales.  Then we started taking control of our money and we started doing most of our clothes shopping at TJ Maxx and Ross.  Now hubby is more than happy to buy his clothes at the Goodwill (and he is a sharp dressing guy!).  Which brings me back to Ross.  We were at the men's clearance rack and there were some nice, stylish shirts on sale for $5 and $6 so I told him he should get some and he said \"no way..I can get hardly-used shirts that look just like those for $2 at the Goodwill!\".  We didn't end up buying anything at Ross that day.Update on the bank card: the charges were removed by the bank so all is well.  The process was actually very simple (fill out a form and scan it as well as the bank card then email the documents to the bank).  I'm still appalled that people would steal like that though and even more appalled that it was more than likely a military member that did it (the charges were made on a small Marine base in Japan).I am lazy.  I've been a bit lazy the last couple days (actually I have been reformatting my book...with copious amounts of caffeine I may be done soon) so instead of heading out last night we stayed home and watched TV.  I really wanted to see the Gay Pride Parade in downtown Las Vegas as well as the First Friday Art Walk (both free) but the thought of wading through 50,000 people and finding parking was daunting so we didn't go.  And I should have done the first Volksmarch of the season today (they take summers off here because it is so hot) but it started an hour earlier than usual (because it is still hot) and I was too tired to drag my carcass out of bed this morning.I hope you are all having a wonderful weekend!"},
{"title": "A Late Night Rant", "date": "Tuesday, September 4, 2012", "text": "I am livid!  Hubby was checking his Visa Debit card to make sure that a credit he was expecting back on the card posted and he noticed two charges that posted to the account today that were made on a military base in Okinawa Japan.  We aren't in Okinawa Japan.  We don't know anyone in Okinawa Japan.  So we called up the bank and they said it was no big deal, just fill out a fraud report and the money--only about $40--would be credited back to the account.  Apparently this sort of thing happens all the time according to the lady at the bank.  But never to us.  So we filled out the form, his card was cancelled, and the bank will be giving him a new card and a new account number but I am appalled that someone--a military member no less because the charge was made in the Exchange store so you have to show your military ID to make  apurchase--would steal someones credit card and use it.  OMG what is this world coming to???  I asked the lady in the fraud department how this could have happened (she said there were dozens and dozens of ways this happens) and how we could have prevented it (she said when she finds out she will write a book but so far there really is no way to prevent this sort of theft from happening).  GgrrrrrA bunch of stuff today in no particular order...>>>Some great links:21 Ways Rich People Think Differently A quick video about how little stuff you actually need to travelLiving Happily With LessDon't Put the Cart Before the HorseThe Cheapest GenerationWhat's in Your Bag?>>>Can you help??  I wrote a grant for my old non-profit (which is really a wonderful organization that does great work in the community and which, unfortunately, like many non profits, is perpetually broke) and I thought that would be the end of it then I found out that while we made the top six, we would have to get people to vote for us to get us into the top three which would get the grant money.  So if you can, please go here and vote for the Kitsap Immigrant Assistance Center (sorry about the clunky voter interface...I didn't design it).>>>Hubby and I are suffering from a bit of newish car envy.  Our neighbors recently put their five year old, nice looking SUV up for sale for only $5000.  Hubby and I both admired the car and and thought that it would be really nice to have a good looking newer car.  And we could probably swing it (pay the $5000 out of savings then sell our old, trusty van for around $3000 and replenish some of the money in savings) but then we looked at the down side (higher registration costs, higher insurance costs, not knowing if or what mechanical problems it might have, plus the biggie--the loss of $2000 from our savings) and decided against it.  Oh well, I am sure another good opportunity to buy a car will come up when we are better prepared for it.>>>Our Japanese visitors made it to California where they are enjoying the beaches and the sunshine (warm sunshine as opposed to the roasting sunshine we had in Vegas).  That's them in the picture above.>>>The book I am working on is basically done.  Now I need to set up a website for it and hit up CreateSpace to get it published (for some odd reason I am a bit freaked out about actually publishing it).  But then I watched this video again of Megan unwrapping her newly published book and thought, that is going to be me soon and I can't wait to be that excited.  So most of today will be spent figuring out how CreateSpace works.>>>We are getting our wills, living wills, and medical power of attorney done next week.  This is important because we haven't updated our wills in years and since we moved to a new state and bought a new house, I figured we should probably get these things updated ASAP.  Fortunately there is no charge to do this at the military base.  Interestingly, now (as opposed to before) they email you a form to fill out online with all of the info that goes into the documents then when you get to the office all you have to do is basically sign them....off now to work on my book :)"},
{"title": "What's Important to You?", "date": "Monday, September 3, 2012", "text": "You should live your life according to what is important to you personally.  I had never really given it much thought but it makes sense that I should know what is important to me so decision making would be easier, deciding what things I do and don't do would be easier, and even making simple, everyday choices would be easier. After a bit of thought I made up a list of things that are important to me which I will then be able to use when doing everything from weighing decisions to deciding what kind of purse to buy.  It should also make financial decisions easier as well.Here are the things that are important to me:Not having a regular job.  Don't get me wrong, I love to work, I just hate the idea of a name tag and a time clock and office politics.Writing.  Writing is super important to me.  I do it every day.  Now I need to focus my efforts on productive writing.Not having debt.  Also super important.  Any time I think I need a brand new expensive thing (car, $500 cell phone, trip to Asia this minute before I have the money saved for it) I remind myself that not having debt makes my life infinitely better.Having as few bills as possible.  I hate bills but with a house, you get utility bills and with a \"traditional\" instead of nomadic life you get even more bills.  I still look at our bills each month and wonder if there are ways to cut any of them out.Having a welcoming home and lots of guests.  I have loved having people visit us since we moved to Las Vegas so this is something that is important to me.Having minimal possessions.  This is a bit difficult when living with a packrat (*cough* hubby) but I am continually trying to streamline our possessions and not bring anything new into our house unless it is absolutely necessary.Traveling.  I love to travel.  I also need to generate more income so I can afford to do this.Having a great relationship with the hubby.  He is awesome and I am so grateful that I have him (note that having been together for 26 years there have been some bumps in the road but I am very happy that we have settled down to being a \"boring old married couple\").Having quality possessions.  I may not want to have a lot of possessions but I do want the things I have to be of high quality.Having money in savings.  This is important to me but since buying the house, our emergency fund has been quite anemic so I need to make some effort to fill this account back up.Helping people when I can.  The wording is important here.  I have always liked helping people but I have found that I am less than enthusiastic to help ALL people ALL the time, especially in a bureaucratically controlled way.  Now I drift through life helping people as needed and as I can instead of trying to fix everyone.Excellent health.  I say this is important yet I often don't make the effort to do things that will improve my health.  So I need to start doing this; my older self will thank me.Excellent physical fitness.  Ditto.Being unique.  I like being unique but I often careen between following the crowd and just being me.  So I have decided to be unique.  This means I will no longer force myself to buy Nikes when I would rather have funky Easy Spirit shoes and I will no longer think I should buy a Coach purse because it is cool when I would really rather have a LeSportsac purse because it is cute.Being an amateur genealogist.  I love this hobby, I just need to spend more time doing it (and money, unfortunately).Paying bills annually.  Like I said, I don't like bills so I would like to get to the point where we have saved the money which will allow many, if not most, of our bills to be paid annually (or if this isn't possible, at least the money will be in savings so the cash is there to pay a year's worth of the water, sewer, garbage, etc bills as they come in each month).Lots of new experiences.  I have always loved new things.  New places, new experiences, new challenges, etc. so I will continue to look for new and interesting things to do and experience.     Being creative.  I love to be creative but again, I need to remind myself that I am more creative (writing, web design) than crafty (sewing, etc).  In fact, I have yet to use the (very cool) sewing machine I bought a few months ago.  So I need to learn my limits.Being organized.  This is easy.  I am always organized ALL the time.  I've lost count of how many people have asked us if our house is always so clean.  Yes it is.  I detest clutter and everything has to be in its place (fortunately hubby and I are the same on this point).Being a person of good character.  I'm trying to improve.  I still over promise when I should just say no sometimes."},
{"title": "Just Had an Amazing Week with Our Visitors from Japan", "date": "Sunday, September 2, 2012", "text": "Our friend's visit from Japan went amazingly well!  They were two college kids--my friend's nephew and his college roommate--and they were so funny and entertaining.  At first I thought that it would be a huge expense to entertain them and keep them busy while they were here but with a little planning, everything went really well and fairly inexpensively too!  Here's what we did:Day 1:Picked them up from the bus station in the evening and took them to a restaurant at the casino that hubby plays poker at.  We all had prime rib dinners (they seemed enamored with beef and amazed at the huge serving size!).  Cost: free due to hubby's comps from playing at the casino.Day 2:We ate breakfast at home--hubby is a great cook and made Japanese food for the boys who were happy to see rice after a few days in California eating only American fast food).Went to the Grand Canyon.  It was a long drive (about 9 hours there and back) but our only expense was gas (we used our car instead of renting one and--yeah!--it made it there and back with no problem.  Gas was about $100).  We also packed a picnic lunch to eat once we got there and of course brought plenty of bottled water and canned soda in our cooler.  We had previously purchased a $10 \"forever\" National Park Pass so entry into the Grand Canyon which is usually $25 per car was free.When we got back to Vegas we stopped by the Rio Casino and watched the free \"Show in the Sky\" which really impressed them.  We had dinner at a Chinese restaurant also free compliments of hubby's casino comps.  I forgot how much teenage boys can eat!Day 3:We ate breakfast at home (this is a big money saver).  You can do a lot with eggs and rice!The boys wanted to go shopping so I took them to the outlet mall and we walked around for four hours (!) and they bought a ton of (expensive) stuff.  But I guess many American brands are popular in Japan and they said the prices here for Guess and Nike and Tommy Hilfiger and Polo were much cheaper than in Japan.We came back home and ate dinner (this time I cooked Japanese food for them--curried rice...yummy).In the evening we walked the Las Vegas Strip and they were impressed.  They caught the fountains show at the Bellagio and mostly marveled at all of the excitement of the Strip after dark.  Cost: free.Day 4:We ate breakfast at home (a recurring theme).We took them to Red Rock Canyon (again, this was free with the National Parks Pass).  After hours of walking the trails and climbing over the rocks the boys were happy and pretty much worn out.We went to In N Out Burger to give them a taste of a good American burger (cost was about $20).We used free coupons from the weekly paper to pay for the entry fee for the swap meet where they did a bit of shopping.We then took them to the Fremont Experience which was free and super entertaining.  We watched a concert, did some dancing, and watched the hourly light and music show.We were exhausted at the end of the day so we picked up Domino's Pizza on the way home (about $15 for their carry-out special).Day 5:We made them a nice breakfast and then took them to the bus station so they could finish up their vacation in Los Angeles for a few days before heading back to Japan.Over all we had a great time!  It was much less expensive than I thought it would be and with two of them it was a lot less exhausting than I figured it would be as well (I have Aspergers so when people visit us individually it means I have to make conversation for hours and hours which is actually physically exhausting for me.  With two of them they kept each other entertained).  I had also stopped by the library before their visit and picked up a half dozen Japanese movies which they watched in the evening--they don't speak much English so having movies to watch which they can easily understand was something they enjoyed.  Plus since they are teenagers, they were pretty much continually connected to their iPods for both music and internet :)Now I need to catch up on all of your blogs!"},
{"title": "Five More Things I Forgot to Mention Yesterday", "date": "Sunday, August 26, 2012", "text": "I was so tired of typing yesterday that I forgot a few things in yesterday's post...We made our own foamy soap thanks to Google.  Hubby told me to write 'foamy soap' on our shopping list.  We get it from the $1 store and he uses it for shaving and $1 isn't expensive at all but I remembered that I saw a recipe for this soap online so I Googled it and we were able to make a bottle of foamy soap for pennies.  All you do is take your foamy soap dispenser, add a tablespoon of liquid hand soap (we buy these big refills for our liquid soap dispensers at the $1 store as well), fill the rest of the dispenser up with warm water, shake, use.  So simple and SO cheap!My favorite shaving lotion (for my legs) is hair conditioner that I buy from the $1 store.  It works really well and is a lot cheaper than buying special shaving soap.We have adopted a homeless man.  We noticed a guy had built a shelter in a vacant lot on a road we travel every day and gave him some bottled water a couple of times.  Now hubby brings him food nearly every other day when we drive by (usually leftovers as hubby cooks big meals each night and we can't finish all of the leftovers).  And water of course.  I have worked with the homeless before and they often have so many difficult issues (substance abuse, mental health issues, lack of job skills, etc) that it is hard to \"fix\" their problems but at least keeping people fed meets a basic need and it is better than just handing money to panhandlers.Our new neighbor is a mystery.  We finally met our next door neighbor just as she and her husband were selling their house and moving out.  A couple weeks later the new owner moved in but it was kind of odd...we didn't notice them actually move in (no moving van, no furniture delivery, no mad scramble to get all of their stuff into their new house like we did when we moved in), we have seen them leave their house once (at least their car was exiting their garage but the windows were so darkly tinted we didn't actually see them), and they immediately installed a high tech security system (based on the new sign in their yard from the security company).  Hubby wondered what they were protecting if they didn't move anything into their house!  Interesting...I like news aggregators so I don't have to hunt all over the internet for topics that I want to learn about.  AllTop is a great aggregator and covers hundreds of topics.  This is the link to their Frugality aggregator page.Happy Sunday!"},

{"title": "On the DMV Merry-Go-Round", "date": "Tuesday, August 21, 2012", "text": "Well it's time for us to register our car here in Nevada.  Although we have been here for months, we didn't change our registration because we decided that if we weren't able to buy a house here, we wouldn't be staying and would probably end up moving either to Georgia or back to Washington.  Now that we bought our house and moved in last month, we knew that we had to register our car but we have been so busy we put it off until now.  Yesterday hubby went to get his new Nevada license (you need to be licensed in the state before you register your car) since our current tags were going to expire at the end of this month but when the nice police officer pulled us over today, he told us that our current registration had expired two days ago (I pulled out the registration and sure enough it expired on the 19th, even thought the tags say August 2012--we figured it meant August 31. It didn't).  At least we didn't get a ticket, he just said to hurry over to the DMV and get the car registered ASAP.  We knew we needed a smog check and went to our mechanic who looked at some codes--the check engine light was on--and said it won't pass the smog check.  So this is what we are doing tomorrow:Go get an official smog check (we can't get a registration extension without a no-pass paper from the smog check people).  Cost $20.Go to the DMV with our flunked smog check paper and get a ten-day temporary registration so we can get everything fixed (mechanic said he can't fix the car without the temporary registration because he has to drive it around after the fix and they can't drive it if the registration is expired).  Cost $1.  Run to the assessor's office and get a voucher that will pay the registration fee because hubby is a retired veteran.  Cost: free.Take the car back to the mechanic so he can fix the car.  Cost: $200 (ouch).Take the fixed car back for another smog check.  Cost: $20.Take the car back to the DMV and get it registered.  Cost: hopefully free with the voucher although there may be a fine because our registration is already expired.Ugh."},

{"title": "I Hate Fees!", "date": "Thursday, August 16, 2012", "text": "I don't mind paying for the services that I use but when companies start tacking on fees for this and fees for that I usually start searching for cheaper options.  Here's ten fees I try to avoid:Bank fees.  They already get to use my money (practically) free of charge so I don't feel bad about searching out banks with zero fee checking and savings account (I use two credit unions and now Wells Fargo because the account is fee-free).Tipping.  I know it is a social custom but I really wish the system was changed to one similar to what is used in other countries, namely you pay a fair price for a meal and the restaurant staff gets paid a living wage. While we never skip tipping wait staff in sit-down restaurants, we rarely go to these types of restaurants (they are expensive and kind of a waste of money when hubby is such a good cook).  We also park our car instead of having it valet parked.The myriad of airline fees.  I always buy our air tickets online (skipping the added fee of using a travel agent), we only bring carry-on bags (skipping the baggage fees), we don't pay extra for aisle or window seats, etc.Credit card fees.  It's easy to avoid annual credit card fees, over limit fees, etc. when you don't use credit cards!I paid a cell phone contract termination fee...once.  Never again.  Now we go strictly with pre-paid cell phones.We always pay our bills on time and in full to avoid paying late fees.I always carry cash with me.  Occasionally I have run into places that charge a fee for using a debit card (illegal at this point but they still do it).  Either I go elsewhere or in a couple of cases, when there weren't any other options, I skipped using my card and just paid cash.I avoid any kind of convenience fee.  I never pay for overnight shipping (I can wait a few days for my package), I don't call 411 to get a number when I can look it up just as easily myself, I buy (the very rare) concert ticket from the venue instead of through Ticketmaster, etc.I like to read boring documents so I generally catch any \"extra\" fees on some services I am using and look for ways to waive or avoid these fees (ie: my cell service doesn't charge for roaming, I got a couple of refunds on our home's closing costs because there were extra fees that didn't necessarily need to be there, and to avoid ATM fees before I had a bank here I would buy something at Walmart then get cash back instead of going to an ATM).I keep good records and look for deductions and ways to lower the amount of taxes we pay. Not a fee technically, but there are a lot of ways to lower the amount of taxes you pay legally which is worth the extra effort."},
{"title": "10 Extra Financial Bonuses from Buying Our House", "date": "Tuesday, August 14, 2012", "text": "Here are ten (financial) side bonuses that came from buying our house that you may want to look into:We bought our house through a mortgage company which promptly sold the loan to Wells Fargo.  We weren't even looking for a new bank but when we went in to make a payment the lady said that because we had a mortgage with Wells Fargo we could get a free checking and money market account which includes free notary service, free money orders, etc.  We grabbed it (our other bank is on the military bases many miles away and this bank is right down the street--really convenient!).I called the water utility to see what kind of offers they had and they sent me a package including low-flow shower heads and faucet aerators for the kitchen and bathroom sinks...for free!I checked out the gas utility's website and found that they will give rebates when we need to buy new gas appliances (stove, clothes dryer, water heater).  I will definitely keep this in mind.I checked out the electric company's website as well and found that they too offer some pretty nice rebates.  While we don't need any appliances right now, this is something to remember because it is like getting free money! (They also offer rebates on solar power systems but that will have to wait--even with a rebate such a system is very expensive).We bundled our car insurance with insurance for our new house and ended up getting a great rate (much better than having insurance through two separate companies).I need to check with the county tax assessor to see if there are any discounts for seniors on property tax.  Currently we are considered lower income and hubby is a senior and in many jurisdictions this will get you a discount on your property tax.If I ever need to make some quick cash using my house, I will definitely check out this website which allows you to rent rooms in your house for a night or two to tourists (we happen to live in a tourist mecca which is a plus) and make instant money.Owning a house also gives us the option to start a home-based business such as babysitting or pet sitting (our house has plenty of space, a back yard, a great location, and zoning isn't a problem either).I love that we live close enough to shopping, stores, banks, etc that I can walk and save gas which is a small added bonus (note I haven't tried this yet as temps have been over 100 for the last two weeks).Our house is a tax write off!  Of course we can deduct property tax and maintenance but if I decide to open a home business I can write off house expenses for that as well."},
{"title": "10 Random Things", "date": "Monday, August 13, 2012", "text": "I'm mostly buried in research today (genealogy and for a book I am working on) so while I take a break I figured I should post something...  Here's what's going on today...We got on the reserve list for the movie Hunger Games at the library.  We are number 1048! (I'm hoping the library bought more than a few copies).Whenever hubby wins in poker he gives me money which I immediately use to pay a bill.  He gave me $20 yesterday so this morning I went and paid our $20.25 water bill with it.I'm feeling like a snack and we don't have any snack food in the house (keeps us from random grazing on unhealthy food) so I think I will bake cookies later.I hate it when I run in to a dead end on a person I am doing genealogy research on!  So frustrating!On another genealogy note, the person I thought was my grandmother's grandmother all of this time was actually a step mom to my grandmother's father.  Turns out his first mom died a couple of years after he was born along with his brother who died as a toddler.  My grandmother was named after this woman.  I wonder if my grandmother knew any of this?Another mass shooting, this time in Texas earlier this morning.  Is this world going to Hell in a hand basket or what???We are hosting a big surprise party for one of the cousins on Wednesday so hubby will do a mass of cooking and I will do a mass of baking.  The cousin's sisters paid for all of the food we will be cooking which was nice.My friend's nephew and his friend will come from Japan next week to visit.  First they will go to California then they will come here to Vegas.  I am really looking forward to their visit and we will be taking them to the Grand Canyon which should be interesting (other than that I have no idea how to entertain two teenage college kids from Japan!).It's hot all this week (which is why I often stay home instead of going with the hubby).  Today it is supposed to be around 110 degrees!  Fortunately (and something I didn't know before moving here) it rains quite a bit in the summer which is nice to keep the dust down.If you want to learn about what disastrous decisions you should avoid, watch Judge Judy or Divorce Court...I think these two shows cover about all of them!"},
{"title": "25 Concessions", "date": "Sunday, August 12, 2012", "text": "When we decided we wanted to live a lifestyle with a lot more freedom and a lot less money, we took a hard look at where our money was going and decided we could continue to live as we were (spending like maniacs and working like maniacs to keep up) or we could totally change our lifestyle so that we would work less and spend less.  We decided on the later and I couldn't be happier but there were a lot of concession we had to make in order to make this lifestyle work.  Here's a list:We moved from a city with a higher cost of living (outside of Seattle) to a city with a lower cost of living (Las Vegas).  While I like Seattle a lot more than Vegas, the much lower cost of living has sold me on the place (not to mention the SUNSHINE!).We bought a house with payments that are 1/3 the amount the payments we had on our last house.  While it is a smaller house, I just love it and with a smaller house comes lower utility bills, no yard so no yard guy to hire, less time to clean, etc.No more new sports car for me.  We have one (well used, older) car that we both share.  And it's paid off so no car payments.No more manicures and pedicures--I do this myself now.  Unfortunately the results are nowhere near salon quality but it will do.No more cable TV.  We bought over-the-air antennas for each of our TVs and receive free TV.No more cool cell phones and expensive cell phone plans.  We use basic cells phones and $30 per month pre-paid plans.Instead of every-six-week appointments at the salon for a $35 haircut, I now use my $4.99 coupon for a haircut at Great Clips (and try to wait at least eight weeks between haircuts).I don't buy books anymore.  Instead I check them out from the library (it only takes one time of having to pack and move an entire library of books to make you want to switch every book you own to an e reader!).No credit cards.  Which is why I am dying for a Samsung Galaxy 7\" tab but have to wait until I actually have the cash to buy it.  This does, however, save a ton of money over paying with credit cards then sweating the payments each time you get a bill.We don't buy movies any more.  Hubby checks them out from the library (at an alarming pace!) and now we don't have to pay for, store, or take care of a bunch of movies we will probably never watch again.Fewer vacations.  Fortunately I am not having vacation withdrawal yet because we traveled so much over the past couple of years (easy to do when you don't have a house payment!) but there is no more booking a cruise or two each year in addition to a few cross country vacations.  On the bright side, we live in a vacation destination so people can come visit us!Less stuff.  Besides having less food stored which I don't much like (I like a big surplus just in case) it is much nicer having a lot less stuff to deal with.  Our garage is positively sparse...I could roller skate in there!We eat leftovers.  A lot.  I hate the thought of wasting food and if a meal was good once it will certainly be good again so we tend to eat leftovers rather than throwing them away.We don't go to restaurants nearly as often.  For many years we ate out at least once, often two or three times a day, and that was super expensive (not to mention super unhealthy).No dry cleaning.  If clothes don't survive the washer-dryer test we don't wear them.  Needless to say I am quite happy that I haven't had to wear a business suit in a couple of years.No spur of the moment shopping.  Each shopping trip is planned and budgeted for (which was kind of a bummer when my friend was here--she was shopping with abandon but I didn't buy anything because we hadn't planned or saved for me to buy a new dress or a new pair of shoes).   We actually go out of our way to control our utility (water, gas, electricity) usage.  We never tracked our spending on utilities before and just paid whatever the bill was, but now we are hyper aware of what we use because we know that each kilowatt hour of electricity adds up.We also track how much driving we do.  Gas is expensive these days!  Actually gas was expensive before but I didn't really care.  I used to drive a lot and spend a lot on gas but now we group all of our errands together and try to not drive a couple days a week in order to save gas.Our shopping cart is decidedly less colorful.  Instead of the pre-packaged, pre-made food we used to buy (expensive and unhealthy!) we now buy meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, and rice (with an occasional splurge on junk food from the $1 store for me).  Kind of basic but much healthier.We don't wander around the shopping mall for entertainment.  Actually I like to walk the huge malls here in the summer for exercise (it's too hot to walk outside) but it makes me want to shop so now I try to walk around casinos because I have absolutely no urge to gamble.We don't give much money or many things to people anymore.  Which is unfortunate but it is one of the changes we needed to make to remain financially solvent.  I would really like to give the grandkids those little games you see kids playing (I found out they are Nintendo DS3s) but at $180 a piece that is way out of our prices range!We don't give ourselves many presents any more either.  It's been years since I bought a new Coach purse and hubby doesn't buy many things for himself either.  We used to justify extravagant purchases because \"we deserved it for working so hard\" but we don't work so hard any more and while we may \"deserve it\" we don't want to slave away at a job just to have it.  On the flip side, if the hubby and I are both healthy and happy, that is more valuable than anything...cue violin music :)Our hobbies have change too.  I used to like shooting (ammo is expensive!) and going out dancing and the hubby used to bowl all the time but we are both aware that the expenses from hobbies can get out of hand so I have started doing genealogy (which is more expensive than I thought!) and hubby plays poker (with a small, limited budget each day...fortunately he wins more often than loses) as our hobbies.  I also like walking with the Volksmarchers every weekend (which is good exercise and cheaper than a gym membership).We do without things that most people would just purchase.  Currently we have two night stands which are actually TV tables with cute covers on them simply because we haven't been able to find nghte stands of the kind we like and at a cheap enough price.  Before I would have just went to a furniture store and bought what I liked but that is very expensive so for now, TV tables work fine.Finally, we look for any other way possible to save money.  This includes but is not limited to: ordering free water-saving shower heads from the water utility, shopping on senior day at the Goodwill, buying a lot of things at the $1 store (especially produce), using coupons for food and restaurants, attending the rare movie during matinee time and on senior day, having parties at our house and cooking at home for the parties instead of taking everyone to a restaurant, etc.While there are a few things that I miss about our previous lifestyle (mostly buying whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted) I am much happier now that we have a very stress-free life.  Of course it takes work and a lot of concessions to get to this point but whenever I am feeling like we are missing out on a lot of things, I ask myself if I would rather have a new purse, car, computer, etc or if I would rather have the freedom to not have to work and the freedom of not being strapped with monthly payments for these things.  Of course the answer is always a resounding yes to the latter!"},
{"title": "This Weekend...Is Mostly About Genealogy", "date": "Saturday, August 11, 2012", "text": "Yesterday I spent more than eight hours working on my genealogy research.  I'm kind of like that--when I get involved in something I have laser focus to the point of forgetting to eat and even forgetting the time.  So far it has been fairly fascinating.  Besides finding out a couple of family secrets (both of my grandparents were married to other people before they got married which no one ever talked about), I found out yesterday that my fifth great grandparents had six kids but four of them died in one year from scarlet fever (that gave me goose bumps...how horrible!).  Then I looked up the history of the time and the area and found that there were three \"pandemic\" type outbreaks of scarlet fever in the 1800s.  So this research is fascinating and it also exemplifies how random life can be.  I am the result of one of my fifth great grandparent's two kids who lived--plus the myriad other decisions people made like where they ended up living and who they met then in turn married...it's kind of mind-blowing when you think about it.On a financial note, genealogy is a good, inexpensive hobby on one hand--much information is now available online--but on the other hand, ordering birth, death, and marriage certificates is expensive!"},
{"title": "What's In My Purse", "date": "Wednesday, August 8, 2012", "text": "Wow two posts in one day!  Actually I have been doing a mass of research for genealogy and when I got tired of that I did a mass of research for a book I am working on then when I got tired of that I went to read some blogs on my blog roll and saw this post and this post about what's in your purse so I hauled out my purse, emptied the contents across the island in our kitchen, and took a picture.  Here's what's in my purse:The purse, of course, featured here.A book (I always carry a book with me to kill time if I end up waiting in a casino...thus the need for a tablet as outlined in today's post).A couple of kleenexA small notebook from Barnes and NobleMy two favorite pens (a Zebra F 402 and a Pilot Precise V7)A basic cell phoneA wallet with all of my ID, bank cards, etc in itSunglasses (it is Las Vegas after all)Keys (exactly two, one to the house, one to the car)And a little flowery pack that I keep a bunch of useful items in (pocket knife, thumb drive of my computer files, tampon, two bandaids, tiny flashlight, $1 in quarters, safety pin, rubber band, a wet wipe, a packet of aspirin, and floss)What isn't pictured is the camera that I always carry with me (Canon Powershot ELPH 300 HS) since I didn't have another camera handy to take a picture with.Also, I sometimes carry a small bag of makeup in my purse but in the summer I have decided not to because it is soooo hot outside and I don't want it to melt if I happen to stay outside too long so I put my makeup on in the morning and hope it stays on all day.What's in your purse?I came across this article a couple of days ago and it really made sense.  In fact both the hubby and I cancelled our expensive contract cell phones/plan and instead bought our own unlocked basic cell phones from Amazon which we now use with a TMobile pre-paid cell phone plan.  The plan is pretty cheap--$30 each for 1500 talk minutes/texts and internet access--which is basically all we need.  I just noticed that Walmart has a similar plan for TMobile with $30 for 100 talk minutes plus unlimited texts and unlimited internet which I may be switching to. I really can't understand how people can pay over $100 a month for their cell phone plans!  Yes, you get a bright, shiny phone (like a new iPhone or new Android phone), plus with an unlimited plan you can watch movies and stream music till your heart's content, but who wants to watch a movie on a 3\" screen??  And many of the people I see with these phones look like they can barely afford such an expensive monthly bill.I guess it comes down to what's important to you (for me it's saving money, for others it may be always-on phone and internet access) and what you can afford (well, it should be based on what you can afford but as I said above I don't think some people consider this).In my case, a few months ago I had switched to a nice, new Android phone but I felt the $50 monthly fee was too high (I usually have my computer with me and internet access anyway so this wasn't absolutely necessary with a cell phone) and I noticed that like many other people I would be glued to my cell phone constantly, jumping every time an email dinged or a Facebook post was made by a friend, and ignoring the hubby and anyone else who was with me which wasn't very nice.  So I went back to my basic cell phone and basic pre-paid plan and sold my new Android phone on CraigsList for a $50 loss :(Now--ever the tech lover--I am really thinking about going back to a smart phone because of the $30 Walmart monthly plan.  I really don't talk on the phone too much, preferring instead to text or send Twitter/email messages, so I would be paying the same price (except for, of course, buying the smart phone for about $200) and getting a better plan.  I was also thinking about keeping the phone and pre-paid plan I have now but getting a Samsung Galaxy 7\" tab and a $25 a month pre-paid broadband plan for it (which would total $55 a month for phone/internet service).  My logic for this is that I would have internet access everywhere and since the tablet is bigger than a cell phone I could even blog and read books on it (plus I would have to actually open it to get any messages so I wouldn't be tempted to \"answer\" every time a social media message comes in).  Of course the hubby just rolls his eyes but I can't help it--I love tech stuff!"},
{"title": "Some Free Exercise...and Some Links", "date": "Monday, August 6, 2012", "text": "Last night was the first time we have gone dancing in ages.  During all of my 20s and most of my 30s we were in nightclubs nearly every day of the week (then our friends closed their club and we got a bit lazy and stopped going dancing all together unless we were on a cruise ship).So last night I got dressed up (I used to look much better in a mini skirt than I do now...eeekkk), put on those shoes you see above (big mistake...I was practically crippled by the time we got finished), and we danced for about four hours at a local casino nightclub that featured a live band and lots of ballroom dancing (it's an Asian place and everyone ballroom dances...to every song so matter if it is a boogie, cha cha, or a hip hop song!).  It was fun and best of all, it was free.  There was no cover charge and we don't drink so basically we walked in and stayed on the dance floor for an hour then when the band went on break we walked around the casino until they began to play again. Overall, dancing is excellent exercise and it is fun as well (next week we are going to invite our cousins to come along).  There were lots of people there in their 60s, 70s, and 80s and all looked slim and healthy so maybe they are on to something (it was a bit disconcerting, however, to see 70 year old women with their faces full of glitter makeup though...) and I highly recommend dancing if you want to get some good--free--exercise.And now some interesting links...25 Simple Ways to Save An Extra $100010 Frugal Living Tips for Happiness on a Tight Budget7 Unexpected Costs of Summer"},
{"title": "Repurposing...And Five Other Things", "date": "Saturday, August 4, 2012", "text": "We were out and about yesterday and I really needed a purse (well need might be too strong a word, people don't really NEED purses).  First we went to my favorite purse store, the Coach outlet.  $150 for a purse...on sale?!  Uh, no.  Then we went to my second favorite purse shop, LeSportsac.  It was a little better at $59 for a cute purse, but again, no.  Then we were at Ross and I saw this iPad bag for $8.99 and I grabbed it.  I thought it would make a cute purse and for such a cheap price, I simply cut the little handles off of it, added the shoulder strap, and \"ta da\" repurposed as a purse!And five more things from today...The paleo diet is off.  We were at a dim sum place today and my protein choices rolled by.  They were basically pork things (I don't eat pork), chicken feet (uh...no), and tripe (ditto).  Then shrimp wrapped in rice noodles rolled by and I grabbed it.  End of diet.  I will still try to avoid gluten so I guess rice is OK.  Someone remind me, the next time I talk about any sort of diet, that I have absolutely no will power and dieting is an exercise in futility!We might have saved a man's life today.  After we left the dim sum place we got into our car then noticed that the guy parked next to us was slumped over the steering wheel with his car still running.  We tried knocking on his window but he was unresponsive so we called casino security and they showed up.  Then we left so we don't know what happened to the guy but I do know that you can't sleep in your car in Las Vegas in the summer--it's more than 100 degrees outside!I need an iPad or similar device (actually I am lusting over the Samsung Galazy 7\" tab).  This may be a real need as we are often out all day and I don't have internet access at the casinos hubby plays poker at and an iPad would come in very handy to do my blogging and social media stuff.  I guess I better get to writing because an iPad isn't a necessity so it isn't coming out of our emergency fund.We noticed a scam of sorts.  Our last couple of guests left us \"free\" tickets to a Vegas show.  We went to claim the tickets today in hopes of going to a show this afternoon and were told that all of the free tickets were gone but we could \"upgrade\" for an extra $10 or $20.  We asked when the next show would be that we could get the free tickets for and the guy said next Tuesday.  Of course we took them but then we figured that the average tourist would have got these vouchers (much like our guests did) and they would have probably been told that they couldn't use them until the following week and since they were here for usually a weekend or so, they would have probably just paid the fee so the tickets wouldn't go to waste.

{"title": "I'm Loving Senior Discounts!", "date": "Thursday, August 2, 2012", "text": "Well actually I am not getting the discounts as I am not quite a senior yet (mind you, I am not complaining about that), but hubby is a senior so everywhere we go I always ask for a senior discount.  Here are the senior discounts we most often receive:At the movies today I paid the $7 matinee price and hubby paid the $4 senior matinee price (one theater here has senior discounts any time before 4pm Monday thru Friday while other theaters only have one day a week in which they offer reduced prices for seniors).At the buffets hubby always gets a senior discount.Nearly all of the casinos in Las Vegas have special \"senior days\" or special discounts for seniors (for everything from buffets to bingo packs to drawings for seniors to slot machine or blackjack tournaments for seniors only).I remember my grandmother used to get a discount on her property taxes when she became a senior. I am going to check this out with our local auditor's office.Whenever we book a cruise or even an airline ticket I always ask if there is a senior discount available.  Ditto for hotel and rental car discounts.  Amtrak also has special senior rail passes.My insurance agent said that if hubby takes a senior driving course he will be eligible for a discount on his car insurance which I am going to look into.I always ask at stores if they have special discounts for seniors and most of them do.  For example, we always take advantage of half off day for seniors on Wednesdays at the Goodwill and 10% off at Ross on Tuesdays for seniors.Hubby paid only $10 for a lifetime membership card for entry into all of the national parks in the US.  There are often similar discounts at state parks as well as senior discounts for fishing and hunting licenses.When we visit attractions I always ask for a locals discount (for me, in Las Vegas) and a senior discount (everywhere, for hubby).  This works nearly everywhere from museums to performing arts events to community event entry fees.Usually I try to use coupons at Great Clips (where we get our hair cut) but if I don't have coupons I always ask for a senior discount for hubby (coupon prices are usually less than the senior price).I have heard that some cell phone companies offer discounts for seniors who do not use many cell minutes but I haven't checked this out yet.Many sport and recreation places offer discounts for seniors such as bowling centers and golf courses (many bowling centers here only charge seniors $1 per game!).  Ditto for health club packages for seniors and health spas too!Also around Vegas are a number of senior-only groups which offer cheaper ways to enjoy activities such as this hiking club, this international tour group, and these college classes (actually many universities and colleges offer discounts for seniors).Some other places that offer senior discounts (but which I haven't checked out yet) include: discounts for pet grooming, discounts on prescription, discounted checking services at banks, etc."},
{"title": "This is Why You Should Shop at the Goodwill", "date": "Wednesday, August 1, 2012", "text": "It's (senior) Wednesday so of course we hit up the Goodwill this morning.  Thankfully our house is almost completely decorated so there isn't much more we need to buy but I was happy to find a big picture I can put on the last bare wall in our bedroom.  The point of this post, however, isn't about this particular picture but about shopping at the Goodwill.While for most of you, I am preaching to the choir, but there may be a few people who still think that shopping at a thrift store is...icky...for lack of a better word.  A few years ago I thought that shopping at thrift stores was icky.  I had been in those types of stores a couple of times but I'm sure I made a sour face and walked out pretty quickly because the stuff was old and used and there is a certain odor that permeates the store and it doesn't smell like Macys.  Then a couple years back I decided to take the plunge.  They had just opened a new Goodwill store by our house.  It was light, bright, and, frankly, the number of BMWs and Mercedes' in the parking lot was a bit surprising.  So I went in, found some amazing deals on clothes that looked practically new, and became an instant convert. When we finally moved into our house last month it was a given that we would shop at the Goodwill before looking anywhere else for home decor, dishes, and other things needed for our house (we had sold nearly all of our things before we headed off to travel so after moving our meager possessions into our house we needed to fill in the blank spaces).  To date we have been able to decorate our house nearly entirely from the Goodwill.  Needless to say this has saved us a boatload of money. Case in point...Isn't this a pretty picture?  It's huge and heavy and fits the decor just perfectly in our bedroom.And here you can (kind of) see the back of the picture.  If you can't see it well, the price tag from the store that someone purchased it at says $99.00.  At the top right, the Goodwill price tag says $24.99.  Add in the fact that it is half-off day for seniors and we paid a grand total of $12.50 for this picture!  I love the Goodwill!"},
{"title": "10 Things I'm Enthralled With Today", "date": "Monday, July 30, 2012", "text": "For lack of anything better to chat about this evening...I decided to use Gramps for my genealogy research.  It's free and supposedly uber-powerful and now I just need to learn how to use it.  I also got the birth and death certificates that I ordered for my mom today which was a bit surreal.I picked up a knife to use today and was...enthralled.  My sister-in-law just moved to Florida and when she was cleaning out her house she was nice enough to send us a big box of cooking things because she knows hubby likes to cook.  Turns out the knife was a $100 knife...I don't think I've every used a $100 knife before.  Wow!I'm trying to psych myself up to do the Whole30.  As you know I have crappy willpower but I think if I could hang with this program for a month it would totally and completely change my health.I was bored today so I whipped up a new website for a client using an awesome template I found here. The difference between coding a website from scratch and using a template is (for me) days.Reddit.  Actually there are about a dozen subreddits I frequent like r/frugal and r/webdesign. I am always enthralled by reddit.  Warning: reddit can be addictive and it is a huge time waster!I was fiending for my favorite ice cream today which you can only find in the Pacific Northwest.  Their Espresso Madness is truly divine.  I settled for a bland store brand :(I read this article today and was wistful for our days of freely traveling.  It seems odd that we get mail every day (we got a mail delivery once a month when we were traveling).  Unfortunately most of our mail now is house/utility bills (something I definitely miss as we didn't get any bills at all while we were traveling!).I want to volunteer somewhere.  I love helping people but I haven't done so in ages so I am considering volunteering at a school, at the library, or at the hospital.  For a brief moment I considered starting another non-profit but just as quickly dismissed that idea--I don't want to do THAT MUCH work.I am reading one of Julia Quinn's novels and am totally enthralled by her writing style!I was enthralled to learn--today in fact--that there is a mountainous area nearby complete with trees and waterfalls.  Who knew?  We will be checking this out soon!"},
{"title": "10 Things I Am Thinking About This Weekend", "date": "Saturday, July 28, 2012", "text": "In no particular order...I am slightly worried about hubby.  He has had a few cognitive glitches over the last month which is concerning (he forgot how to spell a common word, we had to argue about the name of a city in the Philippines ...and I was right...and I have never even been to that city(!), he went the wrong way when we were leaving a shopping center than we had been to a hundred times before).  He is seeing his doctor next week so somehow I am going to mention this to her (on a side note, we had great doctors in Seattle for over 20 years but when we moved here our only option was the military hospital in which you get a random doctor each time--the two he has seen so far have been less than impressive).  Other than those incidents he is perfectly fine but still, one too many \"senior moments\" makes me worry.We tried to crash DEFCON today.  I really, really, really wanted to attend but it was $200 and I didn't have an extra $200 so I didn't go but today we were driving by and I said \"let's just see if we can walk in to the convention area\".  So we headed that way but a big guy at the gate told us we couldn't come in without a badge.  Bummer.  Also on a side note, today hubby won in his poker game and handed me $200 of his winnings...a little late but I am sure I will put it to good use.I'm really really really going to try to go paleo starting August 1st.  I want to be like these guys.  Or all of these guys.I did a speedtest on my internet and found that I am not getting nearly the speed that I am paying for. (Actually I am only paying $19.95 for the first six months instead of the regular $59.95 but I will complain on Monday nonetheless.  If I was actually paying $59.95 I would be livid).I went to a free genealogy class last week at the local library.  I love free classes!  I am trying to decide which free genealogy program to use.  Gramps is highly rated but others like Legacy better so I will need to do a bit more research.Speaking of genealogy, I was doing some research and found that one of my ancestors came to America in 1629.  I swear you can find everything online these days!I have been trying to walk more but in the summers here the only place to walk is inside and the only \"inside\" place to walk is in the malls and walking in the malls makes me want to shop :IThanks to those of you who donated to help me fill a box of books and school supplies for an elementary school in the Philippines!  I am getting the box tomorrow and have enough things to fill the box about half-way so far.  I hope to get it sent within a couple of weeks (then it will take another six to eight weeks to be delivered by ship).I have just been lazy the past few days.  No idea why (crappy diet maybe?) but I'm hoping the paleo thing will also restore my energy.I have been doing some work for my friend in Washington this past week.  While in the midst of a crisis she calls and says \"can't you just fly up here NOW???\", I have found that tools such as LogMeIn (not to mention Skype/email/etc) let me get A LOT of work done remotely.Well that's all for my weekend.  I hope you are all having a wonderful weekend too!"},
{"title": "30 Ways We Are Saving Money in Our New House", "date": "Friday, July 27, 2012", "text": "Now that we are all settled into our new house, it is decorated to the hilt, and the pantry is full, we have reverted back to frugal mode.  Here's a bunch of ways we are saving money:Our bathrooms each have a six-light light bar across the vanity.  Hubby unscrewed four of the lights in each until they no longer turn on when we flip the switch.  We figure we are saving 240 watts each, every time we turn on the light.It's easy to hit the bathroom sink (single-handle) faucet and turn the water on warm.  We are careful to make sure the handle is all the way to the right so we are only using cold water when we turn on the faucet instead of draining the hot water tank.My shower is sparse--shampoo, soap, razor.  Simple.  And inexpensive.  My sister has about 50 beauty products lining her shower, all expensive and most unnecessary.Since each bathroom has a window, we have gotten used to opening the blinds in the bathrooms to light the area during the day instead of using the lights.Both of the showers have low-flow shower heads (provided free by the water utility).  Otherwise I can empty and entire hot water tank with one shower!Each bathroom has a Soft Soap soap dispenser from the $1 store.  Then we bought a giant refill of softsoap for a few dollars which should keep these dispensers full for a year!I don't like the chemical smell of air fresheners so to make our house smell nice, we simply open the windows in the morning to air out the house.I only do laundry once a week (of course these are full loads).I do all of our laundry in cold water.I only use half the recommended amount of laundry soap with each load and the clothes get just as clean as using a full measure of soap.I cut the dryer sheets in half and only use half a dryer sheet per load (again, I'm not a fan of chemicals).I use Spray and Wash for stains on clothes and it works really well (this also means we don't toss out clothes each time they get a stain).I use the minimum amount of time needed to dry our clothes in the dryer instead of setting it for an hour or more (clothes dry in about 35 minutes).  It would be cheaper to hang the clothes to dry but I tried that and they come out crunchy. Ick.We have a total of two TVs in our house and they each have an antenna so we can pick up free over the air TV.  We figure guests will just have to watch TV on their computers instead of buying two more (expensive) TVs and antennas for the guest rooms.We keep the air conditioner set at 80 degrees during the day; 82 degrees at night.We use ceiling fans to help keep the house cool (these really work well!).We have minimized the number of things we have which saves money.  Instead of buying ten sets of sheets for our three beds, we have a total of four sets which is more than enough.  Ditto for towels, wash clothes, etc.We have closed the vents in the unused guest rooms so we aren't air conditioning and heating rooms we don't use.Everything is super organized.  I have a shelf that contains a sewing box, and office supply box, a box of thank you and birthday cards, etc.  This way I know where everything is and don't need to run out and buy things that I already have but can't find.We don't wear shoes in the house.  It's socks or bare feet on the carpet and slippers on the tile kitchen floor.  This saves a ton of cleaning and keeps the flooring looking good for years.We use small lamps with energy-saving fluorescent bulbs to light the tasks we are doing (reading, computer work, etc), instead of lighting up the entire room.While the house is well insulated (even the garage!) we have noticed that the insulation around the doors is pretty lousy (like you can easily slide a piece of paper between the door and frame).  We are buying and installing new weatherstripping this weekend.Almost all of our decor came from the Goodwill (on half-off Wednesdays).  This includes wall hangings, clocks, lamps, etc.  This has saved A TON of money over buying retail (for items that are worth pennies on the dollar should you want to sell them at a garage sale).We have a \"winter ensemble\" stored in a spare closet.  This includes extra blankets, sweatshirts, sweatpants, socks, etc.  While air conditioning is a requirement in Vegas, we rarely used any sort of heating last winter.  If it got cool we just threw on a sweatshirt or covered up with a blanket while reading or watching TV.Entertainment at our house is free.  This includes a stack of books and a stack of DVDs checked out free from the library each week. We have an old DVD player hooked up to one of the TVs which works great and hubby often watches movies on his computer.We did spring for cable internet, however.  For the first six months we are getting it for $19.95 a month and when this offer is over I will call and ask for another discount (or we will cancel internet).  There is no way we want to pay $55 a month for internet. The pantry and supply cabinet is stocked with loss leaders.  If a local store is offering products at super low prices we stock up.Hubby tracks our electricity meter each day.  Right now we are averaging about 40kwh, in the condo we were averaging 20kwh; we are definitely trying to hit as close to 20 kwh as possible as this means our electricity bill would be $65 a month instead of $130.We are generally gone all day long.  When we are gone we turn off the AC completely and since nothing else in the house is using power, we can actually only use 3kwh of power for the ten to twelve hours we are gone.We water our landscape--what little there is of it--twice a week.  Although we have a watering system and most people use these systems to water every day during the summer, our landscaping still looks fine with only a little water twice a week (water and electricity are the highest-costing utilities in Las Vegas).Well that's all I can think of so far.  We are actually living quite well.  Being frugal doesn't mean that you have to suffer to live as cheaply as possible.  By making small changes that really don't impact your overall standard of living, you can really save a lot of money!"},
{"title": "20 Ways to Deter Burglars", "date": "Monday, July 23, 2012", "text": "We finally met our next door neighbor the other night and found that she is just getting ready to move to Florida.  She is a very nice lady and it is too bad she is leaving!  She mentioned that someone had attempted to break into her house the previous week which really set me on edge.  I mean, it looks like we live in a nice neighborhood but you never know (Vegas neighborhoods are really quite different than the laid back, rural neighborhood we lived in outside of Seattle).  No wonder everyone wants to live in a gated community here!Then I was reading through a bunch of blogs on my blog roll and came across this post by Louise and nearly freaked out.  I'm sure the massacre at the movie theater didn't help either but it really made me wonder what this world is coming to (and sent me into a panic about being robbed or having something equally horrible happen).  Which led to me making a list (I always make lists when I am in a panic, it helps to calm me down).  Then I set hubby to work on the list.  Fortunately he is in full agreement that we need to take our safety seriously and one way to do this is to make our home as unappealing as possible to burglars (on the flip side, if a burglar did break into our house he would be sorely disappointed as nearly everything we own came from the Goodwill and what little that is of value is usually taken with us as hubby wears his jewelry, and I cart my laptop with me everywhere which leaves exactly two TVs that would be worth anything at all).So, back to the list.  Here are 20 things that we are working on in order to make our home more secure:We put up \"beware of dog\" signs on the outside fence.  Not that we own a dog but this may be a small deterrent.  We've talked about getting a dog (a better deterrent than just the sign) but we have always had large, outside dogs and I can't see keeping a big outside dog here where they can't even go outside because it is too hot for four months out of the year.  Note that even a small, yappy dog makes an excellent burglar deterrent.I will also put up a 'no solicitors' sign.  We have had many people knocking on our door recently trying to sell us things (I think these companies get a list of people who have recently moved into the neighborhood) and on one occasion it seemed like the people were more interested in seeing what was in our house rather than selling us something...maybe they were casing our house for a future burglary?  I've decided to not open the door to people I don't know.We will make a video inventory of everything in our house to use in case we do have anything stolen (this is much easier than trying to remember everything we own).  I used to write out a list of our home inventory but doing it on video, then storing the video in a safe location, is much easier and possibly better for an insurance claim.We need to install a motion detector light in the back yard.  There is one light there now but it either is on or off; a motion detector light is a better deterrent when it comes to people creeping around your back yard.We need to trim the plants that are in the front yard.  They are getting kind of big and would provide a bit of cover to someone trying to hide on the front porch and break in so these are going to be cut down to size ASAP.We put a big, strong padlock on the back gate yesterday.  The neighbor said that the small padlock that was on her back gate was cut off when someone went into her back yard and tried to get into her house through the back door.We need to get timers for a couple of lamps in our house.  Usually we are home by early evening anyway but for times when we aren't, having lights going on and off at random times makes it look like someone is home.We are going to engrave our driver's license number on larger items (basically the two TVs).  If I had a lot of money I would put tracking chips on these and other important/expensive items we own).We have made \"safe rooms\" both upstairs and downstairs.  We will install better locks on these doors, add flashlights, and possibly put cheap cell phones in these rooms as well (the phone doesn't need to be active in order to call 911).We were looking at alarm systems yesterday.  While we don't want to get a monitored service (the cost is too high for what little we have to protect), we did look at a variety of door and window alarms which looked useful.  We have considered putting a remote, wireless camera system in our home.  We have installed a couple of these systems for friend's businesses and while they are a bit expensive, they are quite useful.We will also look for better security for the front door and back slider.  Currently we have a deadbolt on the front door and a regular slider lock on the back door but there are better items out there to reinforce these doors.Hubby also made a rope which loops around the bedpost that would allow us to escape from our upstairs bedroom (this is more for fire safety).  Obviously this is better than just jumping from a two story window but I can't picture either of us descending gracefully on a knotted rope...but it is better than nothing.I told hubby we should add a container of bear spray to our arsenal.  This stuff works pretty well and it is a non-deadly form of protection.I also told him it would be nice to have a hand alarm (something very loud that you just need to push a button to activate) available.I have seen some pretty interesting \"hidey holes\" that people create in their house to store valuables in.  There are dozens of ways to do this, everything from creating fake books to actually building secret storage areas in your home.We are both usually armed.  Obviously a big deterrent but this is a big decision for people to make.  I have always had an interest in firearms and have been shooting since I could pick up a gun (targets, I don't like hunting animals).  I don't recommend that people just go out and buy a gun for protection since a lot more goes into this sort of decision than what type of gun to buy (close quarters combat tactics, the legal ramifications of shooting an intruder, etc).  Also, obviously, this would be a last resort when it comes to someone breaking into our house.  I would much rather deter them from the start and create enough difficulty getting in that they go elsewhere.I've considered starting a neighborhood watch group.  I don't see that there is an active group in our area but having neighbors watching out for each other is a good idea.  I plan to attend the next HOA meeting and bring this up.We are consistently inconsistent.  Since we are basically retired, we come and go from our house at all hours.  It looks (on the crime map) like there have been a half dozen burglaries in our neighborhood over the past year, usually at times when people are at work.  If someone is casing our home they will notice there is no certain time we are at home or gone.Finally, I think it helps that our house is usually pretty busy.  We have people (guests, friends) coming and going at all times as well.  I think it would help to always have a car parked outside to make it look like someone is always home but at the moment we only have one car.  That's all I can think of now.  Are there any other tips that I am missing?"},
{"title": "We Did Our Own Plumbing Repair (And It Should Have Been Posted on YouTube!)", "date": "Saturday, July 21, 2012", "text": "Ever since we moved into our house my shower has had a steady drip, drip, drip going on.  Hubby didn't believe me because 1) he doesn't use my bathroom, and 2) he can hardly hear which means that even if he did use my bathroom he probably wouldn't have heard the incessant dripping that was driving me crazy. So we did a little experiment by putting a bucket under the spout over night and sure enough there was a good couple inches of water in the bucket when we woke up the next morning. Note that I was right...again :)We thought 'how hard could changing a washer on a drippy faucet be?' then set to work to do the job ourselves.  I even Googled the problem and watched a video of how to fix the problem (it looked so simple in the video!) so we thought it would take a half hour or so and we would be done.  Six hours later...we were finally done.  Here's what happened:I called Delta (the faucet maker) and the lady told me the part number that I would need and that I would need to replace the entire cartridge that sits inside the handle and turns the water on and off so off we went to Home Depot.  The cartridge cost $39.95.  Yikes.  But we figured it would save us money in the long run to not be wasting so much water so we bought it.We came home and attempted to pull out the old cartridge.  Since we have hard water and seven years of mineral deposits in the shower the simple instructions to \"just pull out the entire cartridge\" actually took about an hour.  I also called the nice Delta lady back and she said to soak a rag in vinegar, heat it up, and soak the area around the cartridge to get the part to release.  After much tugging (half broke off and came out first then it took a while to get the stuck half out...ayayay) we finally got the cartridge out.The lady mentioned that after we got the cartridge out we should turn the water back on and flush the system for a minute.  Hubby dutifully ran down to do this while I watched the water.  I watched the water blast out of the wall at a 90 degree angle, much like what happens when you open a fire hydrant--the water then proceeded to ricochet off the back wall of the shower, blast out the shower curtain, drench me, and leave two inches of standing water in the bathroom (cue funny YouTube video).  Hubby heard me screeching then ran back upstairs to see what happened.  He couldn't stop laughing for like two minutes.  I looked like a drowned rat.  Ugh.After cleaning up the bathroom (I had planned on mopping the floor anyway) we proceeded to put the new part into the shower, put everything back together, turn the main water supply back on, and then watched as water one again blasted out of the faucet (fortunately it was contained by the faucet so it was pointed down the drain!).  No matter what position the handle was in, the water kept running so I called the nice Delta lady back again in a panic.  Visions of calling a plumber and getting a giant bill were dancing in our heads at about this time.The nice Delta lady surmised that we must have got the wrong part (it so happens that our house was built right when they were switching from one part for the shower to another...we needed the other).  So we took out the part, wrapped it back up, and made another run to Home Depot (they looked at me funny because at this point I was still dripping wet) but we did get the correct part this time.We went back home, put the new part in and it worked!  The moral of this story is that most home repairs can be done by you and you will save a lot of money this way.  There are tons of videos and forums online for nearly any repair you want to make which are really helpful but then again there can be that momentary sense of panic--especially where water or electricity are concerned!--that will make you break out into a cold sweat and immediately want to shell out a wallet full of money to a professional who actually knows what they are doing.  At this point take a deep breath, don't panic, hit up Google, and proceed forward."},
{"title": "10 Things About Cookies", "date": "Thursday, July 19, 2012", "text": "Here are the cookies I baked a couple of days ago.  And here's ten things about baking cookies (mostly I love to write in bullet points if you haven't noticed):I always use quality ingredients when baking (real butter, not margarine; real vanilla, not the fake stuff, etc).Cookies are super simple to make (I can't believe people buy store-bought cookies when making your own are less expensive and usually taste better!).I usually add whatever is on hand when I bake.  This is especially true for baking banana bread because I can add chunks of apple, chunks of banana, raisins, dried cranberries, chocolate chips...basically anything and it still comes out well).I don't add nuts to any of my recipes when I bake.  Because I usually give away some of the things I make and because nut allergies are so prevalent these days I figure it isn't worth the risk to add any sort of nuts to my baked goods.When I made the cookies above I halved the recipe since it is only the hubby and I (and I didn't want to eat an entire batch of cookies by myself!).  The cookies still come out fine when I use half of each ingredient as called for in the recipe.One blogger suggested that instead of halving the recipe to make fewer cookies that I instead make a full batch and freeze the other half of the batter so I can bake the rest of the cookies at a later time which is a really good idea.I keep all of my recipes on my computer (this is an especially good idea when you usually use the recipe on the back of a product--like Quaker Oatmeal cookies or Nestle Toll House Cookies--but this time you bought a generic brand of oats of chocolate chips which doesn't include the recipe you usually use).  On a side note, if you haven't done this and are using a generic product you can Google the original recipe online.I can't cook.  I can bake.  Hubby has never baked but he is an excellent cook.  This works out well for us, especially when it comes to parties.I always use quality baking pans.  Fortunately I have found many of these pans (bread pans, cookie sheets, etc) at the Goodwill but a good pan is worth paying even full price for because the result of using these pans is superior to using cheap, thin pans.  Ditto for buying a good wooden spoon, nice mixing bowls, a quality cast iron pan, etc.Baked goods make a good gift.  It's an Asian thing that whenever you go to someone's house, you bring something to give the person you are visiting.  Most people bring wine, flowers, pastries from a bakeshop, etc.  Whenever we go to visit someone I bring baked goods.  This is much cheaper and I feel it is a much more personal gift."},
{"title": "Powering Through a Headache and a Plea for Help", "date": "Tuesday, July 17, 2012", "text": "I think I am allergic to humidity.  The humidity in Las Vegas has been hanging around 6% for months until a couple of days ago when it shot up to near 60%.  I immediately got a sinus headache and it felt like someone was tap dancing on my forehead.  I probably have a minor sinus infection which I used to get but haven't had since we moved here so I will wait it out for a few days and see if it passes.  Ugh.  This is what I'm doing today:I'm going to make chocolate chip cookies.  We have decided to do all of our shopping one day a week and shopping day isn't until tomorrow (which happens to coincide with half-off senior Wednesdays at the Goodwill).  For the past few weeks we were shopping nearly everyday, mostly in order to get the house decorated and also because we always needed little things like ziploc bags or we would run out of things like cooking oil or vinegar.  Last week we said \"enough\" and decided we would only shop one day a week and if we ran out of something we would just go without until the next shopping day.  Today I am out of snacks and I am craving something tasty so I will have to whip out the mixing bowl and make some cookies.I am trying to think of a way to make a quick $200 so I can attend the DEFCON conference which will be held in Las Vegas on July 26th.  That clearly doesn't qualify as an emergency so I wouldn't even think of taking it out of our (currently puny) emergency fund.  Although I am not much of a hacker (my only claim to fame was hacking into my college's mainframe back in the dark ages; it was quite by accident and I don't even know if they had passwords back then) but it looks like it will be a really interesting event.I made myself a new website because I was bored.I am currently reading Karen Ranny's 'A Scandalous Scot'.  She is one of my favorite writers!Two links to share with you:  this guy's story looked interesting and this is one of my favorite, informative, positive websites.Finally, I am working away on my family genealogy project.  While I have traced one line of the family back to the 1500s (I recently found out that I am a direct descendant of the Barney family...as in Smith Barney...and that some of my ancestors were movers and shakers in England as well as early Massachusetts.  They would seriously be spinning in their graves if they saw the family now but anyway...).  So while this is documented, I now need to put together the actual paper trail complete with official documentation such as birth certificates, death certificates, etc.  I sent off for my mother's birth and death certificates as a starting point, but it looks like it will be an expensive undertaking because each certificate is around $20! Yikes!And a plea for help...I decided to start doing some sort of monthly project to help others.  My first project is to send a box of books to a needy school in the Philippines (info here).  If you would like to help, that would be great!  Next month I want to send them a box of school supplies.  In September I want to do something for school kids here in Las Vegas.  After that I am undecided but I know that around Christmas time, I want to hand out $20 bills to random people (unless I get rich by then it which case it will be $100 bills!)."},
{"title": "Revamping and Revising, Links, and Yes, I Want to Be Rich", "date": "Monday, July 16, 2012", "text": "I'm on an organizing kick so I have revamped and revised some of my blogs...followed by some links...followed by an explanation about getting rich...First, I deleted the excess pages on this blog (quick tips, links, and my bucket list) because I think it is more pertinent to post what is going on now, now.  So when I come across a good link, I will just post it in a post because usually the links are timely and deserve your attention now and plus this way you won't have to go hunting through the blog to find the links I want to share with you.I changed my other blog around a bit and decided to make a separate blog about Las Vegas because there is so much to blog about here plus I think it will generate a better income stream with a more concise topic instead of all of the ramblings I post in my other blog.  Of course in this blog you are reading now I will still post a little bit of everything, mostly related to money.  Here's a link to the Vegas Blog. Here's some links I want to share with you:Gardener Feeds Family on $100 a monthHow Traveling Has Changed My View of PossessionsHow I Found Bliss in a Creaky Old RentalStudy Finds Americans are Overwhelmed By Clutter, Rarely Eat Together, and are Stressed Out11 Ways That Consumers Are Hopeless About MathAnd finally, I have decided that I should like to be rich and will make every effort to become so.  It was kind of a light bulb moment for me.  While being frugal and careful with my money and staying debt free has allowed me to basically vegetate to my heart's content, it also tends to leave me with little money and lots of time.  Then I thought that with more money (while still being frugal and still using cash only) I would be able to do so much more for myself and for others.  Plus this is a pretty optimal time to make such an effort since I have good health, lots of time, no kids or others at home to take care of, and bunches of ideas floating around in my head.  So while the term \"rich\" is really based on each person's circumstances, I basically want to do things that will bring in a fairly hefty income which will allow me to give to those in need, pay for big ticket items like travel for me and the hubby as well as the occasional family reunion for all of the kids and grandkids, attend community events (there is a hacker convention coming up that I am dying to attend...which happens to cost $200), help friends in need (if I could afford to send some movers to help my friend in Seattle right now I would gladly do it), and write a check to buy a car in full and with cash (it has always been a dream of mine to walk into a dealership, pick out the nice new car I want, and pay cash for it...but so far this is still a dream). The bottom line is that I will still come up with as many ways to save and stretch my money as possible, but I also want to figure out how to bring in as much money as possible (and somehow without a \"regular\" job...just the thought of which makes me shudder).  This should be an interesting challenge."},
{"title": "10 Things I Did Today", "date": "Saturday, July 14, 2012", "text": "It's been a relaxing yet productive weekend so far...I made yogurt (so simple i don't know why everyone doesn't make their own yogurt).I also made granola (ditto).We checked out the final weekend of the World Series of Poker.  There are only a couple of hundred  people left (out of 6000+ who started) and the winner will get over $8 million dollars.  Sadly hubby didn't make it into the tournament.We went to the mall (just to walk which I realized when my friend was here that I needed to do more of) and I came away with a mini skirt and a silk top.  Each were $5 on a clearance table!  I told you my wardrobe is hideous so I am making small efforts to change it.I decided I will be rich.  A longer post on this will come later but basically I realized that frugal is good but having money gives you a lot more experiences and a lot more interesting options in your life.I got another \"reservation\" from a family member for a vacation at our place for her and her family.  Mostly I am surprised because no one came to visit us in Seattle and now everyone wants to visit! (I'm beginning it isn't us they want to visit but the city...).I Googled the reason that my nose feels like someone punched me this morning.  I may have a sinus infection.  If it doesn't clear in a day or two I will cart myself to the doctor.We picked up a carry-out special from Dominos Pizza because we were too lazy to cook.  It was $6.50 for a large pizza which will actually make two meals so that is still pretty frugal.I read these interesting articles online:   article 1   article 2   article 3I've been hammering away at my genealogy project.  The internet is SOOO crazy useful for this!  Some nice person put eight generations of one part of my family tree online (my third great grandmother was Rachel Barney).I hope you are having a nice (and not overly hot) weekend!p.s.

{"title": "I'm Back! Finally!", "date": "Thursday, July 12, 2012", "text": "Whew!  After a full week of house guests (thank goodness we got the house with two guest rooms instead of one!) I am finally back.  Here’s a run-down on what happened (with money lessons, of course) over the past week:Thank goodness the airport is so close to our house (schlepping people back and forth is much easier when it isn’t a two-hour haul—each way—like it was when we lived near Seattle).It’s fun having guests but since I have Aspergers, making small talk and entertaining people for hours on end is super exhausting for me.  Note to self, make a list of things to do with guests ahead of time so I don’t have to be chatty and/or entertaining (because I am naturally neither). Our first big party which took place last weekend went great!  We cooked enough food for an army, we finished up with everyone dancing and singing (who knew a karaoke system could be so entertaining?), and our house, while small, was big enough to accommodate everyone comfortably.Free is awesome!  Fortunately it happened to be the weekend of the big NCLR conference here in Las Vegas.  I decided to take my friend to the Latino community fair attached to the conference and we had a great time.  It was free to enter and we each carted home freebies galore (pens, note pads, a couple of t shirts, tote bags, a mouse pad, food samples, etc).  It was an entertaining, all-day event and best of all it was free! My clothes are hideous.  My Latina friend also happens to be exceedingly stylish (it’s a Latina cultural things plus she is like a model…she never leaves the house without looking stylish from head to toe. Never.).  Anyway, at the community event we got free tickets to a concert (Pepe Aguilar (his picture is above), Mariachi del Sol, and Kumbia Kingz…amazing!) and while I wore my usual travel wardrobe (basically jeans and a t shirt…all the time) everyone there was soooo gorgeous—both men and women—that I felt severely under-dressed.  I want to throw all of my clothes in the garbage and start over.  Which I might do just as soon as we finish paying for decorating our house. On another note, I noticed that my friend always looks like she is ready for a photo shoot and indeed, when I was with her, I met no less than five famous people (all at the conference including two Telemundo news anchors, Latino entertainer Peewee, an actress from a Univision soap opera, and the guy that won the UFC fight this past weekend).  Not sure why but I think it has to do with being in Las Vegas where famous people tend to congregate and the fact that she recognized everyone (I’m face blind so I barely recognize my own husband!). On the way to the concert we got an escort by the Secret Service (definitely a first for me!).  We were looking for the concert venue and stumbled into an off-limits area and noticed a whole bunch of uniformed police officers and a whole bunch of guys in suits.  Turns out they were getting ready for Vice President Biden’s arrival at the Mandalay Bay hotel and so one of the guys in a suit said he would escort us through the area and to the place we were looking for.  Nice! It is impossible to keep a tight reign on our utility usage with so many guests staying at our house.  Hubby is still checking the electricity meter each day and recording our usage so we can keep a handle on our electric bill.  Unfortunately, while we usually use about 20 kwh per day, the day of the party we used 200 kwh (!!!).  After that it averaged closer to 100 kwh per day.  I may freak out when we get the bill.  Yikes. We saved a bunch of money by cooking breakfast, and usually dinner, at home which left us eating out for only one meal per day (eating lunch out is much cheaper compared to eating dinner out). My friend decided to move here!  Currently she lives in Seattle but after a nasty divorce (and probably after six months of grey, overcast skies in Seattle) she saw the sunshine in Las Vegas and noted the much cheaper cost of living and promptly decided to move here.  So I called up my realtor and we fit in a couple of days of house hunting while she was here. On the flip side, my brother in law wants to move here as well.  He loves to play poker (which is unavailable in the state he lives in) and figures that being a professional poker player in Las Vegas is his destiny.  Being my blunt self—also related to Aspergers—I told him that spending hundreds of dollars a day on poker, every day, is destined to make him bankrupt.  He still wants to move here. If I ever eat another buffet dinner it will be too soon.  Everyone that comes to Vegas likes to hit up the famous buffets.  We rounded up some two-for-one buffet coupons and we all went to the buffet one night for dinner and I realized that one, there is no way I could eat $25 worth of food at one sitting (the regular price for the buffet dinner) and two, trying to “get your money’s worth” at a buffet leaves you feeling like you need to carted out of the dining room on a furniture dolly.  Ugh. One nice thing about having guests is that you get A LOT of exercise.  While I have seen the sights in Las Vegas too many times to do much but feign interest in them (the Bellagio fountains! Wow!), all of the walking I got in while touring the malls, the Strip, and other places that draw tourists proved to be hours and hours of excellent exercise for me! At the mall, we were looking at dresses at Saks (actually my friend was looking, I was feigning interest) and she asked the clerk how much one dress cost and the lady said “it’s on sale…it costs hardly anything!”).  “Hardly anything” meant $485…on sale.  Holy cow that is nearly a house payment.  My friend skipped the dress but still bought a ton of stuff that in my previous life I would have wanted as well but now I can hardly justify spending hundreds of dollars on a purse of a pair of $600 shoes that will leave you crippled after walking in them for less than a mile.And on a side note...So far my meager earnings this past month have allowed me to pay all of our utility bills for the month…I hope to be able to keep this up but I need to get busy producing! It’s hot as Hades here…114 degrees yesterday.   I was driving my friend around and she remarked how hot it was each time we got out of the car.  I pointed out the temperature on the car’s dashboard (112 degrees) and she said “wow that’s hot” then I changed the reading to centigrade (45 degrees) and she nearly swooned.  I guess it is hotter when you actually know how hot it is. I registered for next year’s Consumer Electronics Show which is held in Vegas each February.  Tickets are expensive and hard to get but if you register by the end of this month, the tickets are FREE!!  I am so excited to go!!!"},

AND I am extra happy to report that we now have internet at our house which I think will be well worth the cost (it is screaming fast and super convenient compared to schlepping my stuff to the library each day...I think I am getting spoiled now).  We plan to have a pretty low-key 4th as we have a big party planned for next Sunday so we will probably wander around Las Vegas and catch one of the big fireworks shows (I think there will be four or five shows at the different casinos).  I hope you all have a great 4th of July!!"},
{"title": "Our First Party Was A Hit!", "date": "Monday, July 2, 2012", "text": "Whew!  The first social event at our new house went off without a hitch.  Hubby cooked up a ton of food and a bunch of cousins came over from LA and overall everyone was well fed and happy (as a bonus some big PGA tournament was on regular TV yesterday so that gave the golfers in the group something to watch). After a lot of debate we decided to sign up for cable internet (I think the sales people are taught to upsell because I had to tell the guy at the internet company four times that I wasn't interested in cable TV or phone to bundle with my internet).  We had to buy the modem/router ($129--ouch--but that came out a few dollars less than buying a modem and router from Best Buy and it is overall a better deal than renting it depending on if we keep the internet for more than a year).  Plus we will get a reasonably fast internet for $19.95 for the first six months and there is no contract (one guy on a bulletin board says he calls each time one of his cable deals ends and somehow keeps getting discounts so I will mark my calendar to call the internet company in six months to try this).So the bottom line is that the bills keep adding up but it is my goal to have hubby pay the house payment and for food/etc as he has been doing and somehow I want to earn enough each month to pay for all of the utilities (water, sewer, garbage, gas, electricity and now internet) which I figure will add up to a little less than $500 a month (double ouch)!  That and I really need to do something to revive our emergency funds (hubby's, mine, and our joint fund) which are nearly at $0 (triple ouch).  So my goal for the next couple of months is to MAKE MONEY.  Of course saving money is important but when there isn't much coming in to save it means I need to get busy and actually do something to earn!"},
{"title": "And Now We Have Guests...", "date": "Saturday, June 30, 2012", "text": "I mean so many house guests that I need to get a calendar to schedule them all!  I haven't had to use a calendar in, oh, about a year and a half which was pretty nice but now so many people are coming to visit us that I need to have a way to organize everyone.  And while I love seeing friends and having people visit, I am just a bit stressed out because...We are really frugal.  We don't have cable TV (over the air TV works fine for us but it seems like everyone else in the US has cable TV like it is a requirement or something).  So I am wondering what our guests will think when they get a grand total of 20 stations--half in Spanish--to choose from.We are also really frugal in that we keep the air conditioning set at 78 when we are home and on 82 at night (and use ceiling fans...a lot).  We are acclimated to it but will our friends be?  After hearing from friends who live here in Vegas that their normal summer electricity bill is around $200 we can gladly live in a bit warmer home than usual.  Our guests on the other hand...I wonder if they will think we are too cheap.  Yikes.Then today's discussion was about internet service.  We haven't paid for internet service since we moved to Las Vegas as I am at the library nearly every day and use their internet for free.  But I think our guests will probably expect that we have internet so we are looking at the cost between DSL and cable internet and the thought of paying an extra $40-$70 a month for internet is making us both cringe!  So for now, this subject is still up for debate.And then there is food.  Fortunately hubby is an excellent cook and he can whip up a meal out of a little of this and a little of that and people will think he cooked them a gourmet dinner but we haven't even had time to stock our pantry yet (we are buying loss leaders each week so for now we have a mountain of canned vegetables and that's about it).  Of course there are still decor issues.  We have been furnishing and decorating our house pretty cheaply (thanks to the Goodwill and the Dollar Store) but I still want to get a TV and antenna for each guest room, some decor for the walls in the guest rooms, and some curtains as well.  Buying these things slowly allows us to save money and buy the items on sale or when we have the cash for a big outlay (like when buying TVs).  Now that we have three sets of guests scheduled to visit, we will need to speed up this process.And now we only have one car.  Before (when we lived in a place that no one ever visited) we  usually had three or four cars in the driveway and on the off occasion that people did come to visit, we could easily lend them a car to use.  That won't be the case now so we will either have to drive them or ask them to rent a car.Finally there is entertainment.  We have always spent money on entertaining our guests (taking them out to dinner, to do sightseeing, to local events, etc) but since I haven't worked in ages, our income is pretty limited.  Again, I am cringing at the amounts I expect us to spend on our guests.  Fortunately hubby has comps for many restaurants in town so that will make the dinners out free and I have already planned on researching free and low cost activities and things to do during the time that our friends will be visiting.I'm sure everything will work out fine it is just that this is yet another thing that has changed drastically since we have decided to live on a very low income.  Our usual habit of throwing money at a problem to fix it won't work now (we don't have that much money to do this with!) so we will just have to be creative (and \"be weird\" as Dave says) and hope our guests will not be too put out by our odd way of living."},
{"title": "10 Things I Learned from Our Home Buying Experience", "date": "Tuesday, June 26, 2012", "text": "Finally, I think this will be the last post about buying a house for a while but here are a bunch of things I have learned through this whole process...I don't get excited about owning a new house until the keys are in my hands.  After 14 offers it was hard to be excited about anything because the deals fell through so often it was better to not get set on a certain house until we actually owned it.Be patient.  A lot has changed since we bought our last house over a decade ago.  The mountain of paperwork, the documentation, the process of buying a short sale or repo house which is common now, all mean that the entire process of buying a house takes much longer than before and there are ALWAYS glitches that come up.Know what you are doing if you want to buy a fixer upper.  We offered on quite a few fixers because they were so cheap but even though the hubby and I built a small house from the ground up years ago and know how to do fixer upper repairs, we were SO HAPPY that we could move into our new house and do no work.  So, so happy.  I think when we were making the offers we thought we wouldn't mind doing a lot more physical labor and wouldn't mind living in a half-finished house but with age comes wisdom (and a certain reluctance to do hard physical labor and live in a dusty, messy half-finished house for months on end).Have a separate  fund for your new house (not your emergency fund and not your down payment fund).  For the past week money has been streaming out of our savings account like water through a leaky boat.  There are SO MANY things you need to buy for a new place (nails to hang pictures, pillows that match the sofa, deposits for utilities, etc) that it has basically decimated our emergency fund so, note to self, next time build up a separate fund for new house expenses.  It pays to be handy or have handy friends.  There were a lot of things we got free or provided for ourselves that other people would probably need to pay for.  Among these things: appliance delivery (free from our cousin), hooking up the gas dryer (hubby and I did it ourselves), replacing a broken light switch (hubby did this), moving everything to our new house (hubby and I did this), etc.  If you can't or don't want to do these things for yourself you may need even more money on hand to pay for these things.I LOVE the Goodwill and the Dollar Store.  We bought a ton of things for our new place at these two stores.  Walmart came in a close third.  After selling nearly everything we owned over a year ago and realizing all of the cute things I bought at Macy's and other department stores (home decor, sheets, dishes, etc) were worth pennies on the dollar at our garage sales, I will only buy used or super cheap things from now on.It is SOOOO nice to move when you don't have a lot of junk.  Because we did pare down our stuff when we decided to travel and store what was left in a 10x10 storage unit, moving was much easier since we had much less stuff to move.  I've known people who have moved their entire household including 30 years of stuff to a new place and years later they still aren't completely unpacked.When you move to a new place, it really helps to ask people (like our cousins, our realtor, and our new friends who live in the area) about local stuff that may be different than where you came from.  On the second day in our house a big bug walked across the kitchen and I nearly freaked out (I don't like bugs).  I immediately called our realtor and she said it was common for bugs to try to come in where it was cool during the hot summer so to spray the house for bugs and that would take care of the problem.  In cold and rainy Washington we had the occasional spider but never any bugs so I got hubby on bug spray detail ASAP.  Now today I plan to ask the neighbor about the watering system.  It rains so much in Washington that we didn't water outside very often but now we have an entire irrigation system that seems pretty complicated so I need to figure out how the thing works as our landscaping looks pretty parched.Location is important.  When we were desperate and frustrated with the home buying process we made offers on a couple of places that were in less than stellar neighborhoods and a couple of places that were pretty far away from where we wanted to be.  I'm glad those offers fell through because I have now realized how important a good neighborhood and a good, close-to-where-we-want-to-be location is.  Plus this will also save us a lot of gas and mileage on our car over the years we live in this house.Finally, decide if you really want or need to buy a house.  While I think our new house is wonderful, I kind of miss the freedom that renting affords (plus the lower cost with not having to pay utilities, maintenance, etc).  It will be much harder for us to pick up and leave if we want to do any extended travel now that we own a home but at this point, hubby wanted to feel more settled so buying a house did this for him.  I guess this point comes down to where you are in your life and what your plans are for the foreseeable future.Overall I am really happy with our new house and how things have worked out.p.s.  I told hubby that July will be a \"no spend\" month since we

We've Moved Into Our New House!", "date": "Monday, June 25, 2012", "text": "It's been a busy week, thus the lack of posts.  Here's what's been happening:Last Monday.  We sign some papers and are supposed to close on the house so we wait...and wait.  Finally around 5pm we sign a one day extension because the house isn't going to close on Monday.Last Tuesday.  We are really, really going to close today.  The realtor said we would get the keys at 10am but after the paper work shuffle we finally get the keys at 2pm.  Did I mention that by 2pm it was like 108 degrees here?  That's OK, we were psyched so the hubby and I started moving everything out of the condo.  We think we can move in to our new house entirely in one day.  Eventually we realize we aren't 25 years old any more.  We continue moving stuff until about 11pm.Last Wednesday.  We are still psyched but wake up like very old people complete with screaming muscles (which hadn't been used in a couple of years!) and lots of groaning.  We get everything out of the condo, clean up the condo, then use the pictures we took of the condo when we moved in to reset all of the cousin's furnishings in the condo.  By now we decide that we don't want to move again.  Ever.Last Thursday.  We head over to the furniture outlet store and buy a recliner sofa on clearance for $399, and over-stuffed chair which had been marked down from $700 to $99, a queen bed for the guest room which was on sale for $199, and a chair and ottoman for our bedroom for $149.  For an extra $100 they will deliver which we quickly agree to as we were really not looking forward to moving any more furniture.Last Friday.  The cousin gets her gardeners to bring over the washer, dryer, table, and refrigerator which we had bought from her for the bargain price of $600.  We also do a massive amount of shopping at the $1 store, Walmart, and the Goodwill for all of the little things we need for our house (everything from shower curtains to end tables to wall art to trash cans, etc).Last Saturday.  I was so excited to cook on a gas stove as we had never had gas appliance before.  Nearly everything has been set up but we are still working--hard labor style--for about 12 hours each day.  Yikes.  I do laundry then hang it in the garage in order to save money.  Even with fabric softener, our clothes come out stiff and starchy :I  Last Sunday.  After a massive amount of work getting all of the boxes emptied, our newly purchased things set, pictures hung, etc, we are officially \"done\" moving in.  We have left a few things not done until we can get the cash to pay for them, namely shower doors which will cost about $200 each, art for the walls, curtains, and a small bar that hubby wants to get for the kitchen.Today...Monday!  The house is done and we are back to our regular schedule of hubby playing poker and me going to the library to catch up on my blogs and websites (we have decided to not get internet at the house and use it for free at the library in order to save money since I am here nearly every day anyway).Here's some pictures of our new house:"},
{"title": "Happy Father's Day!", "date": "Sunday, June 17, 2012", "text": "While I have never had a father so never had occasion to tell anyone Happy Father's Day, after being married to the hubby for so long, I have come to realize how very important fathers are.  Growing up we lived in an area that was mostly single mothers and the occasional father (who would usually show up when they got out on parole so, uh, not much of an example of fatherhood there).  But now that I am surrounded by men who are good examples of fatherhood, I see that fathers are necessary to set good examples for their children (not that women aren't awesome at being single parents but there are some things that only men can teach).  Examples:I still remember when hubby's boys came to live with us when they were around five and eight.  They would watch him then copy the way he walked so that they \"would walk like men.\"  Before then it had never occurred on me that this was something boys couldn't really learn from their mothers.Ditto for how to treat a lady.  To this day his boys always open doors for women, have never raised a hand to a woman, and have learned how important the phrase \"happy wife, happy life\" is.  I am very proud that they have turned into exceptional husbands and leaders in their own family and I attribute this to the example their dad set for them.How to take risks and do stupid stuff that mom would never approve of.  Anthropologically women are much more risk-averse and safety conscious than men (it goes into brain science and--long story short--men will take risks that women wouldn't dream of taking).  So while I would always hover over the kids and want to protect them from every possible thing that could harm them, hubby would cheer on their idiocy (fortunately on one was ever seriously hurt).  When I saw this video I had to laugh (mostly because the kid was unharmed) and chalk it up to dad doing stuff that a mother would never do which the kid then thinks is the coolest thing in the world while mom wants to ban him from being in the same zip code as his kid....such is life...with father.  I am not keen on admitting this but I think this kind of risky behavior with your kids is necessary (although it is, again, something mom would never do).Genetics can be a shocking thing.  Or maybe it is part of the nature vs nurture thing, but it is eerie how the boys act like their dad...everything from the tone of voice they use with their own kids to the way they argue with their wives, to their subtle \"I am the man of the house\" attitude, to their penchant for having the same quirks and habits as their dad....eerie.Dads can instill a level of confidence in their boys that moms can't.  Moms do a great job of trying to do this, of course, because they realize how important confidence is but it comes more easily with dads who don't give as much thought to it as moms do yet are still able to somehow teach their kids to be confident in their abilities and confident in the decisions they make.  It really is something to behold when one of the boys would jump in and do a task (working on a construction project, fixing a hole in the wall) and say \"don't worry, I'll take care of it\" which would leave me amazed at their can-do attitude.Dads are important to daughters as well. All of the things listed above have impacted hubby's daughters as well.  He was the one who taught them to drive, he is the one they go to with a problem when mom's (or my) advice just won't do, and he is the one that they hold out as an example of a good man.  With dads and daughters there is a less obvious, but equally important, role that dads play in their daughter's lives that can't be replaced by anyone else.So Happy Father's Day to all of you dads out there--your contribution to your family and most especially to your children should not be underestimated."},
{"title": "We're Moving! Finally! I Think!", "date": "Friday, June 15, 2012", "text": "We signed the last of the closing documents today for our house and wired the money to the escrow account so I think that makes it almost, nearly, official that we will be moving.  We are supposed to get the keys on Monday and hubby is so psyched he already has the van packed with the first load of stuff to deliver to the house.  We had a slight glitch yesterday when we went to the signing.  The lender said we would need to wire $1200 at closing so we were ready for that but when we got to the title company office the bottom line was $2800 and I nearly fell off my chair.  After (a lot) of complaining (by me) the lender, realtor, and title company lady said they would get back to us this morning and somehow that figure dropped back to $1200 so we immediately wired the money and now I think everyone is happy (especially us as $1600 extra dollars is a BIG DEAL when you are living on a limited income).  Whew.  I think we may live here forever as the process of buying a house is way too stressful to look forward to doing this again!"},
{"title": "10 Things About Moving (Money Lessons Included)", "date": "Wednesday, June 13, 2012", "text": "I was reading this post on Lorraine's blog about her upcoming move to Florida.  Instead of making my comment on her blog ten inches long, I figured I would just write a post about the moving lessons we have learned so far:I wouldn't buy another house without selling my house first.  Many people want the security of keeping their house until they actually buy a new house to move in to.  In our case, we decided to sell our house and travel for a year or so before settling down again.  This worked out well because we saved a boatload of money by not having to pay a mortgage payment each month.  It is scary though, to realize that you are signing your house away and have no place to live now.  I guess it would be even  scarier to be stuck with two house payments at the same time.Just before we moved we decided to sell almost everything we owned.  Again, we knew we were going to put the remaining items in storage for a year or more and didn't want to pack/load/move/store every single item that had accumulated in our house over the years.  When we moved out we had one bed, two TVs, a futon sofa, clothes, and some boxes of important things and it all fit in a 10 x 10 storage shed.We did the moving ourselves.  We used our van to move stuff from our old house to a nearby storage shed.  Then when we came back from Asia and decided to move to Las Vegas, we rented a moving truck, packed everything into it, loaded our van on an attached dolly, then drove ourselves to Las Vegas and put everything into a storage shed here.  This saved us a lot of money over paying a moving service and/or storing our stuff in the PODS-type thing.  p.s.  This is A LOT of exercise!It's nice to have friends to stay with!  When we moved out of our house we were fortunate to have a cousin nearby in Seattle that we could stay with for a few days until we headed off to the first leg of our travels.  Ditto for having a cousin in Las Vegas who we stayed with for two months before renting a condo from yet another cousin when we found it was taking longer to buy a house than expected (this saved us a small fortune in hotel costs).I really think that when you are moving from one place to another you should rent in the area you are moving to first, for at least six months.  The first offer we made on a place in Las Vegas happened when we were here last summer for a week.  Within two days we found a realtor then found a place to make an offer on.  A few days later we went back to Seattle and waited.  And waited.  Eventually the sale fell through and I am really glad it did because when we came back to Las Vegas months later and stayed with the cousin who happened to live in the same condo complex where we had made an offer, we realized that the location isn't that great, that the complex is right in the path of airliners taking off from McCarran airport every 90 seconds (!), and that having people living above you is horribly noisy and annoying.  Whew.  Dodged a bullet there.Another great reason to rent first is so that you will see if you even like the area you are moving to.  We spent five months in Georgia and at first it was wonderful.  It was early spring and the weather was great and all was well...then we found out that my allergies acted up horribly (for months on end...guess it was all of those pretty blooming flowers and trees), that in late spring there were tornado warnings a couple of times a week (yikes!), and that summer was hideously hot and humid.  I like hot and I like humid but not at the same time.  If we had immediately bought a house and moved there we (I) would have not been a happy camper.  Ditto for the northeast (love the summers, hate the winters), and Chicago (beautiful spring and fall, horribly hot summers and horribly cold winters).Get a good realtor.  We have a wonderful realtor who has been super patient with us.  Our realtor told us where we could buy (Summerlin, Henderson, and the south west) and where we absolutely couldn't buy (north and east).  And she was right.  Anywhere other than where she showed us has pretty bad crime problems (which is obvious when you see row after row of houses with bars on the doors and windows.  Scary).  We are really happy with the area we ended up buying in.Our realtor also taught us about buying el-cheapo foreclosures.  When we first moved here we were seeing dollar signs.  After all, everyone was saying you could buy a nice house here for $40,000!  We learned (after about a dozen offers on cheap repo/short sales houses) that there is more to it than that.  First you have to go up against cash buyers and professional investors who are snapping up these cheap houses to use for rentals.  Then you will see that these houses are usually in bad neighborhoods and/or have been trashed by the previous owners.  Also, once investors have bought a bunch of cheap houses in what used to be nicer neighborhoods to use for rentals, the place becomes kind of ghetto-ish--not a place I really want to live/own a home.  We also found that buying a repo takes a LOT longer than buying from a regular seller (the banks seem to encourage bidding wars...ugh) and that buying a short sale can take forever (at least six months or longer to even get a response!).Find out about your new location--you may be in for some surprises.  We were happy to learn that Nevada, like Washington, has no state income tax (yeah).  We were shocked that water and electricity costs a lot more here than in Washington (I guess for obvious reasons, there is very little water here).  Ditto for car registration (much more expensive) and business licensing (also expensive).  I was surprised that we have seen very few bugs of any kind here (nice!) and it is so hot outside that even though I half expect to see a bear or raccoon clinging to the dumpster when I go to toss the trash, I have yet to even see one stray cat (too hot here I guess).  Living in the desert is totally new for us--I like a bit more rain, a bit more humidity, and to see plants growing wild (not gonna happen here) but overall we do like living here.  p.s. Drivers in Las Vegas are freakin insane...Find out where to go for info.  One thing that has been a boon to us has been our cousins who live in Las Vegas who have clued us in on all kinds of things (best restaurants, which day is senior day at the Goodwill, which days we can get discounts at casino buffets, etc).  Also hubby and I have made a few friends here so we have received good advice from them as well (one friend told us about a wonderful car repair shop, another a good discount store).  When all else fails, I often turn to Yelp (I found a great dentist that way), the local news (for what is happening in the city), and reddit (these people are wonderful!!!  Just go to the reddit for your area like this one for Las Vegas and ask whatever question you need help with and you will get a bunch of responses from locals).So that is what we have learned so far.  p.s.  We are set to sign the closing documents on our house tomorrow and we will be able to move in Monday...color me HAPPY!"},
{"title": "Hopefully I Won't Have to Bore You Much Longer With House Updates...", "date": "Monday, June 11, 2012", "text": "But for this week, I will bore you a bit more.  Here's what we have been doing of late (which is mostly waiting):The lender called and said he needed a paper from Social Security about hubby's monthly SS payments.  We thought we would be on the doorstep of the Social Security office this morning and be the first in line to get the document the lender needed.  We were SHOCKED that over a hundred people had the same idea and that the line wound around the building and out in the parking lot!  Fortunately since we only needed a simple print-out we ended up in the speed line and were done within a half hour.We were happy that the lender called and said that the bank that owns the house will accept the lower appraised value price on the house.  So instead of $125,000 for the house we will get it for $119,500 (and this reduces our payments by $30).  We also locked in our interest rate a while back and it is 3.75%--I've never in my life seen an interest rate that low!  The house will be on a 30 year term but there is no prepayment penalty so we will try to pay it off within eight to ten years.We are supposed to sign the closing documents on Thursday and then will get the keys about 48 hours later (because of the weekend that means we should get the keys on Monday or Tuesday).We have to bring cash (actually a bank transfer) to closing which is something we have never had to do. While most of the closing costs are taken care of (the VA pays a lot of closing costs for veteran's home loans) and it is a $0 down loan, there are still some closing costs that weren't covered so we will need to pay around $1000 at closing.  We have never had to do this before because usually the seller has paid all of the closing costs but the lender said that with bank-owned homes, they don't do this. Bummer...I could have used that money for something better, like furniture.We are so ready to move!  It feels like we have been in limbo for ages so I will be really happy when everything gets done and we get moved!Here are our lessons learned so far:Keep all of your important documents scanned and saved on your computer.  I have most all of the documents we need for the home loan stored this way and it is really useful when the lender calls and says \"can you send me X document.\"  With the documents already saved I don't have to hunt through paper files for them.  Unfortunately, since we have been traveling, the particular paper needed today was lost in the shuffle before I had a chance to scan it.When you are bidding on a repo/short sale, bid a bit high.  I heard this from another guy who successfully bought a house here.  For the first 13 offers, we bid at a price we thought was reasonable for the property.  On this house, we bid $6000 over the asking price and we thought it was high but that made the bank accept our offer over all of the other offers and in the end, the bank ended up accepting the appraised price so it worked out well for us.Interest rates are freakishly low these days.  That makes this a good time to buy a house and/or a good time to refinance your current house loan to a much lower rate.Weekends and holidays can throw a wrench into your plans because everything is done on a count of \"business days\" not on 'all days' so ten business days can mean up to 15 regular days.Put aside money for closing costs.  Even if the seller will pay most or all of the closing costs, there are always extra things that come up and need paid for (the home inspection, appraisal, smoke alarms, and additional closing costs so far for us)."},
{"title": "Some Random Musings", "date": "Saturday, June 9, 2012", "text": "Because I didn't know what else to write about today...We are still in a holding pattern with the house.  The bank hasn't yet approved the lower price for the house, the lender has asked for another bunch of papers (his requests are never ending), and yesterday the lender said he hoped we could close by Tuesday because he is going on vacation for two weeks starting Wednesday o_0.  Needless to say, hubby is stressed out (me not so much as I would much rather pay for summer AC in our tiny condo than in the bigger house so I figure every day that we aren't in the house we are saving money!).I always read the Consumerist website.  It gives you lots of money-saving tips and also gives you a head's up on scams and other important consumer issues.I tried deep fried pickles for the first time yesterday (see photo above).  They were OK but they sound better than they taste.I am really bummed out about my friend's case.  He has been prosecuted for the same case for THIRTEEN YEARS.  I am at a loss as to how to help him but jeez Louise this is a hideous way to treat anyone!On a happy note, I have sold two more articles to Freelance Switch (here and here).  All I have to do now is upload my articles through WordPress and they get published (and I get paid!).  Yippee!The latest object of my obsession is a Samsung Galaxy 2 tab.  I swear I get fixated on something and I don't stop thinking about it until I get it.  Justification: I can do a lot of things online with the tablet and it is better than a smartphone because I can keep my simple phone with a really long battery life while having the tablet for internet access.  Plus I can work on my books anywhere with it, I can download books to Kindle on it, and I can easily update my social networks from anywhere with it (which takes forever on my not-very-smart phone).  The down side (in addition to the $250 price) is that the internet service for it is $25 a month (which still isn't bad because some smartphone plans are around $80 a month; with T Mobile I will pay $30 for phone and text service and $25 for internet access for the tablet).  I'll need to come up with an additional income source to fund this so it may take a while.I hope you have a wonderful weekend!"},

{"title": "Does Poverty = Obesity?", "date": "Tuesday, June 5, 2012", "text": "I just read this article over at CNN which basically equates poverty with obesity.  That has been a pretty common hypothesis since the obesity rates started climbing a couple of decades ago.  The main points of the article are that poor people are fat because they can't afford nutritious food and because nutritious food is not available in stores in areas of high poverty. Growing up poor (but not fat) I have a bunch of random thoughts on this:Kids these days get no exercise.  When we were kids (back in the dark ages) we played outside from dawn to dusk (the only technology back then was a TV set with three channels and it was never turned on until evening so there was no motivation to stay inside) plus the thing all parents told their kids was \"go outside and play\"--basically to get us out of their hair for a while.  We worked on our grandparents farm, participated in PE class, recess, and after school sports, and were generally always in motion.  Obviously things have changed a great deal since then.  Technology keeps many people (me included!) inside and on my computer most of the time these days.  Plus I've seen plenty of poor neighborhoods where you wouldn't want your kids to play outside for fear of them getting beat up or shot so there is that.Parents these days don't cook.  Since I was raised by a single mother, I know how hard it is for single parents who work all day to come home and cook from scratch.  If it wasn't for my grandparents who only cooked nutritious food from scratch I probably would have ended up much less healthier than I did (my mom's idea of a home-cooked meal was a TV dinner).There is too much temptation for fast food and junk food these days.  Again, back in the dark ages and growing up in a rural area, there was a truck stop restaurant a few miles from us and a couple of quick stop stores and that was it.  No Walmarts, no Starbucks, and the closest (and only) fast food restaurant was a McDonalds many miles away...there was basically no place to go for junk food even if we wanted it (also we had no money so that played a role as well).  If we wanted junk food we had to sweet talk grandma into baking cookies or making candy for us.  These days they even sell junk food and fast food on school campuses!There was a lot less processed food back then.  I bet that my grandmother, if she suddenly came to life today, would be hard pressed to identify half of what is sold in grocery stores these days.  Gogurt, hot pockets...there is so much processed crap in stores these days that no wonder people are fat and sick if this is what their diet consists of!We rarely went out to eat back then.  I can count on one hand the number of times my grandparents went out to eat (and of course they went out without us kids).  With my mom, we went out a few more times than that but still it wasn't an everyday occurrence like it is for many people today.There wasn't nearly the number of restaurants back then and they didn't serve troughs of food like they do now.  Living in Las Vegas, or any other large city for that matter, you can literally find any kind of restaurant you want these days.  Plus the number of buffets has increased exponentially over time and you can now eat your weight in food if you so desire which definitely isn't healthy. Finally, the article points out that the highest obesity rates are in the south.  Besides a number of anthropological reasons for this, I can attest that cooking in the south is way better than cooking I have found in other part of the country.  If something can be breaded and deep fried, they will bread and deep fry it which is oh so yummy and oh so unhealthy.  Also, when we were in the south, I swear they did things with food that I have never seen done before (at the Cracker Barrel restaurant they have a wonderful hash brown pie that consists of hash browns--which can be relatively nutritious--but they add to it globs of butter and cheese and cream which makes the dish even tastier--and even worse for your health).Now that I have ranted a bit, here are some solutions:Get active, even if it means taking your kids to the local park and playing with them for an hour a day.Don't bring junk food into your home.  This way you will be forced to eat what you have (healthy stuff hopefully) or you will be forced to make it yourself (potato chips are easy to eat by the bagful when you buy them but if you have to take the time to make them from scratch you end up with less of them to eat and with more effort used to make them).Don't eat out.  This means no stops for coffee at Starbucks in the morning, no running by the local pizza restaurant for take out after work, no bribing your kids with McDonalds, etc.  Obviously this is easier said than done if you are a single parent or a super busy two-parent family.Grow a garden.  Again, it is a bit time and labor intensive but it can pay off with a lot of fresh, healthful food at your fingertips.Cook from scratch.  Even cooking food similar to what you would find in a restaurant at home can leave you a lot healthier than eating out because you control what goes into your food (hint: it will probably be a lot less fat, sugar, and salt than what cooks in restaurants use to make their food extra appealing).Only buy items your great grandparents would recognize.  People say that nutritious food is expensive but one bag of oatmeal isn't that expensive and it lasts a very long time (of course it is much more boring than sugary cereals but it is also much more nutritious).  Ditto for rice, beans, eggs, apples, etc.Go on a junk food fast.  Right now your taste buds are probably accustomed to lots of fat, sugar, and salt in your diet so eating foods without these items makes the food taste super bland.  But you could try an experiment--for one month cut these items out of your diet.  You will be amazed at how your taste buds react after going a month without them!If you do eat out, drink water with your meal (it's free), share a meal with someone instead of each person ordering their own meal (hubby and I always do this and often still have food left over to take home), and skip dessert (this is also a big money save).  The bottom line is that I don't think being poor has to equal being fat.  If we go back to our roots and eat a more healthful diet, minus all of the garbage and the \"convenience\" of convenience foods, and move a lot more than we do now, our obesity rates could be drastically reduced."},
{"title": "You Must Be Rich!", "date": "Sunday, June 3, 2012", "text": "It's funny to us but yesterday was the fourth time I've heard someone say to hubby \"you guys must be rich!.\"  These comments come from hubby's casino friends and once from a friend of mine who noticed that we appear to live well and that we both don't work so in our society that means we must be independently wealthy to live such a life.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  Here's how we \"look\" like we live rich when we really live on a very small fixed income:We have no bills (except for a small rent payment, a small electricity payment, and a small cell phone bill each month).  This more than anything allows us to live on hubby's pension and social security income.  If we had a stack of bills each month, this would be impossible without me working a full time job.We share one car that we paid cash for more than ten years ago.  We keep the car looking nice (clean the inside and wash the outside regularly, fix small dings, etc) so it looks rather impressive even if it is old.We buy our clothes from the clearance racks and from the Goodwill but we make them look nice (they are clean, stain free, no tears, and we always iron our clothes before we wear them).  Really, you can look wealthy with clothes you find at a thrift store if you take care of them and press them before you wear them.We do everything we can for ourselves and thus save a lot of money.  For example, I ran into a friend yesterday and her errands for that day were to get her dogs groomed, get her hair colored, drop off her dry cleaning, and call a handyman to install shower doors in their two bathrooms.  Later they were going out for dinner and then to a movie.  In one day she spent over $400.  For us, we would have washed our dogs ourselves, dyed our own hair, threw our clothes into the dryer in a do-it-yourself dry cleaning bag, installed our own shower doors, made dinner at home, then watched a movie from the library.  The more you do for yourself, the more you can save (or the more you don't have to earn in order to pay others to do these things).We don't have a lot of gadgets.  I love tech gadgets but I can't justify the expense so we use very low tech gadgets (hubby has a Sansa MP3 player to listen to music in place of an iPod, we both have very basic cell phones instead of smart phones, we each have laptops that were rather inexpensive instead of a state-of-the-art MacBooks, heck, we don't even have internet at our place!).  Gadgets and fun things cost money so we really analyze our need for such things and by not buying them, we tend to save a lot of money (unlike before when we needed a boat, RV, top of the line cell phones, etc).  Note that all of the gadgets and fun things usually have ongoing costs associated with them too (upkeep, user fees, maintenance, etc).We have good manners.  I learned this from my grandmother who came from a well to do family but married my grandfather and became a farm wife.  They never had much money but my grandmother was always gracious, helpful, and had impeccable manners.  How you present yourself is a reflection of how you live and if you present yourself well, people think that you live well regardless of your income.We do buy some quality items (on sale of course).  Saving and paying cash for things is both slow and boring (it takes a while to save up for stuff which can be pretty boring when you want things NOW) but by doing this we can buy quality items that we will use/keep for a long time.  This includes some antique furniture which we got a great deal on, expensive watches that hubby likes, purses (I like expensive purses and while I used to not want to caught dead carrying a Coach or LV purse from last season, I am perfectly happy to buy one nice purse--from the outlet store, at 50% off clearance, from two seasons ago--and keep it for years).  We also like free stuff.  If someone is giving or throwing something away, I will gladly take it and remake it/recycle it/or donate it.  I am always on the look out for free events in our city to entertain us, and use coupons prodigiously.  Ditto for taking advantage of free wi fi/books/movies from the library, free over-the-air TV instead of paying for cable, and free handouts from casinos/stores/etc.  Free rocks!Finally, we don't have kids.  Actually hubby has five wonderful kids but they have all grown up, moved out, and are self supporting.  When all of the kids were living at home, we certainly couldn't live like we are living now because kids are expensive!  So our lifestyle has as much to do with the period of life that we are in--retirement age, not young parents with a passel of children age--as much as anything else.So basically that is how we can appear to be rich when we really aren't.  We enjoy simple things, try to conserve (money, gas, resources, etc) as much as possible, take advantage of freebies (everything from free stuff from friends who would otherwise throw an item out to freebies from stores, free entertainment events, etc) and tend to live well even on a small income."},
{"title": "The Home Buying Saga Continues...", "date": "Thursday, May 31, 2012", "text": "We had hoped to be moving into our new house tomorrow but like everything else associated with our quest to buy a house in Las Vegas, we hit another snag.  Everything was fine until yesterday when we were supposed to receive the appraisal then quickly sign the loan documents and possibly move in by tomorrow.  Instead the appraisal came in lower than what we had offered so we had to sign another paper asking the bank to lower the price of our offer (and thus the price of the house) to the amount of the appraisal.  I guess this is kind of common and banks are pretty likely to do this but it is just so stressful!  On the bright side, we will get the house for a lower price and our payments will be less!  So now we continue to wait and while we are at it, we are slowly moving everything out of our storage unit which will save us $75 (since our monthly storage rental term is up on Monday and they won't pro-rate the amount if we move in a week or so we just decided to store everything in our bedroom and sleep on the couch).  Now our condo looks like the storage unit but hopefully things will work out soon...emphasis on soon!"},
{"title": "A Quick Update...", "date": "Sunday, May 27, 2012", "text": "Not much happening here this weekend...We were hoping to move this weekend but we are still waiting for the appraisal so for now the plan is to move next weekend (although I would have preferred this weekend because it is only 80 degrees outside instead of the projected 104 degrees for next weekend!).If there are a lot of homeless people in your area it is a good bet they spend a lot of time in your local library...at least they do here.  I know most of them because I am at the library so much...I will add some more interesting links to the link page after I get finished with this post.It's not even June yet but I have eaten so much watermelon that I am practically watermeloned out!We've been shopping...and shopping...and shopping.  Our condo looks like a storage shed and I am not looking forward to moving everything but still we continue to shop for the new house.  Today we bought shower rods and cheap shower curtains which will have to suffice until we can pay cash for nice glass shower doors.I hope you are having a wonderful long weekend!"},
{"title": "How We Saved $10,280 in Six Months", "date": "Thursday, May 24, 2012", "text": "I was just looking over our budget for the past six months since we have been in Las Vegas and I was astounded at how much money we have been able to save over what we would have paid in our previous \"life\".  Here's how--and how much--we have saved over the past six months:Having a small rent payment has saved us about $900 over what we would have paid for a similar rental condo (thanks to a cousin who gave us a slightly below market deal on renting her condo).  Some friends of ours moved here and they pay a similar amount for an OK apartment in an OK area.  Originally they had rented a really cheap apartment (about $450 a month) sight unseen from CraigsList.  When they did see it, it was horrible so they found another place to live immediately.  Moral of the story, you can live in a \"nice enough\" place for a reasonable amount of money instead of spending big for a really nice place.  On the flip side, you don't want to go too cheap and live in a Hell hole.Not having cable TV has saved us about $600.  Instead we bought a $20 over the air antenna and get about 20 stations which suits us fine and saves a whole bunch of money over the cost of cable.Not having internet in our home saved us about $300.  I usually use the internet for free at the library or if I really need to get online I can use the (really) unreliable signal from the condo clubhouse.Not having a second car has saved us about $6000(!).  For most of our lives, we have always had two cars.  This was part necessity (we both worked) but mostly an ego stroker (in my case...I do miss my shiny sports car though) and a \"nice to have not need to have\" (throughout many of our years together we worked together in our various businesses so a second car was not necessary).  These days we go everywhere together, ride the bus occasionally, and coordinate the use of our car if one of us has to go someplace and the other another place.Not having smart phones has saved us $400 for the phones and $240 for the smart phone pre-paid plan.  I had a smart phone for about a month and realized I was paying a lot of money for something that wasn't really necessary.  With my old not-so-smart phone I can still text (although it takes longer to hit each key three times per letter) and access the internet (albeit super slowly).Not having a home phone has saved us $180.  Our cell phones work fine where we live and other than living in an area with bad cell phone reception, I can't understand why people still pay to have a home phone. Not shopping has saved us about $1400 (ball park figure).  Instead of big grocery shopping hauls we only buy what we will eat for the next couple of days at a discount store (like Dollar General or the 99 cent store).  Also we no longer roam the shopping centers for fun and entertainment and we haven't shopped anywhere other than the Goodwill in ages.  This saves a ton of money over shopping every weekend and buying a whole bunch of stuff--at retail--that we don't really need.Using the library has saved us about $500 (another ball park figure).  We don't actually \"go\" anywhere for entertainment these days.  Unless there is a free event we settle for free books and movies from the library to keep us entertained.The bottom line:  it is possible to cut back your living expense to the bare minimum during difficult financial times or even during times when you want to bank a little extra money for something special or to build up your emergency fund.  We probably won't always live this austerely but it has been a good learning experience and has saved us a boatload of money!"},
{"title": "Furnishing Our New Home on the Cheap", "date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2012", "text": "Well at least I hope we will have a new home to furnish since we haven't officially closed on the house yet.  Right now our small condo looks kind of like our storage shed with furniture and boxes stacked everywhere but we have been getting stuff ready to move and buying furniture and other things to decorate the house with when we move in because we don't really have much in storage to fill up the rooms.  Here's some of our best deals:We needed to buy a kitchen table and chairs.  When we asked the cousin where a good place to buy this set would be, she mentioned that she had an \"old, ugly\" set in her garage that we could have if we wanted.  Of course we jumped on the offer and for $6.95, the cost of some fabric to reupholster the chairs, we saved probably $300+ over the cost of buying a new set.  In the picture above, you can see the old chair on the left and the newly covered chair on the right.  Throwing some new fabric over the old fabric on what are very sturdy chairs is a really cheap way to end up with nice furniture!We were at the Goodwill today (it's half off for seniors day!) and came out with a bunch of good stuff including a high table for our bedroom TV for $12 (pictures will follow when we get the house set up), and three bar stools for $3 each.  I am super happy with the bar stools because the kitchen has a big island and we wanted some stools for the island in case we want to add extra seating in the kitchen.  When we looked at Walmart, the cheapest price we could find for new bar stools was $15 each but they were small and not very sturdy.  Hubby spied a set of three upholstered stools at the Goodwill that were the perfect size and very sturdy but had kind of ugly (well used) upholstery on them so we grabbed the stools and then raced to the fabric store and bought up the last of the same fabric we used on the chairs so we could redo the bar stools as well (hmmm...maybe my side business should be upholstery!).  It was a nice day at the Goodwill!Last week we picked up some end tables for $2.50 each.  They were from Ikea and looked nearly new and were a savings of about $17.50 each over buying new.  A few days later we were at the indoor swap meet here in Las Vegas and a booth was selling close out scarves for $1.50 each so we bought two matching scarves and these will be used to cover the end tables.I'm sure there is more stuff but it has been just a blur for the past week or so.  I will post pictures as soon as we get the house all decorated!"},
{"title": "This Is How We Cut Our Electric Bill In Half", "date": "Sunday, May 20, 2012", "text": "You may remember a while back when we first moved into our condo.  When we moved in, we continued to use our electricity like we did when we were in Seattle (where either rates are much cheaper or we had more money and didn't pay as much attention to our bills...I think it was the latter) and a month later we got a HUGE electric bill which sent me into bill shock.  We immediately took a bunch of steps to lower our electric bill and as you can see from the photo above, we were successful.  Here's how we did it:We started tracking our daily electricity usage by reading the meter each day and recording it.We used these readings to track what things tended to make the meter speed up (mostly using the dryer and a lot of hot water).We changed our habits...a lot.Now I wash our clothes in cold water instead of hot so the water heater doesn't have to continuously heat up water.I also wash full loads of wash instead of a whole bunch of small loads because there are one or two particular items I want to wash.I try to take shorter showers (this works about half the time).I only dry clothes for about 30 minutes then let them sit in the dryer over night and the warmth and super low humidity tends to dry them the rest of the way.I can't wait until we move and I can dry my clothes outside so we won't have to use the dryer at all!Instead of heating the whole house we use a small space heater to heat the one room we are in.Now that it is getting warmer here, we only use the air conditioning when absolutely necessary (such as turning it on in the early evening when we get home to cool down the house then shutting it off and opening the doors to allow cooler evening breezes to cool off the house).We use ceiling fans...a lot.  They really help to keep the house cool.We only turn the light on in the room we are using and are careful to turn off any lights we aren't using.We unplug any electrical appliances we aren't using.We are gone most of the day (hubby playing poker and me at the library using free internet and free air conditioning).  This means no electrical usage at all while we are gone each day.We have very few electrical appliances in our house.  I use my blender quite a bit but for all other cooking I use elbow grease instead of a range of electrical appliances.We do use a convection toaster oven quite a bit which saves a lot of electricity over using the regular oven.That's about all.  We don't really use a lot of electricity anyway as we are only home in the evenings but just by paying more attention we were able to slash our electricity bill in half!"},

{"title": "I Just Applied for a Job....Eeekkk", "date": "Thursday, May 17, 2012", "text": "I was talking to my friend today and she said that she had just put in her husband's job application for temporary positions that will be coming up with the big, eight-week World Series of Poker Tournament which is starting at the end of the month here in Las Vegas.  That sounded like an interesting way to earn a bit of money so I decided to apply too.  Yikes what a pain applying for a job these days is!First I had to make a resume.  I haven't had to make a resume for about 20 years since I have been mostly self employed all of that time and the couple of other jobs I have had during that time were basically handed to me.  I make resumes for other people but never for me.  It's easier to make resumes for other people.  Also, my conundrum was whether to write up my real resume or lie.  Even hubby said I shouldn't put in my actual resume because then they wouldn't choose me because I was overqualified.  So I thought about it and decided honesty is the best policy and I put together a resume with my real work experience and I hope they will see that I just want a fun, temporary job to make a bit of extra money and that it doesn't matter if I am overqualified or have been MIA from the work world during the last year and a half that we have been traveling.Then I had to apply.  A lot has changed in 20 years!  Seems these days all applications for jobs are done online which is quite a change because 20 years ago I would just walk into a place, ask if they are hiring, chat with the manager, and walk out with a job.  Now I have to go to the website, upload my resume, then repeat all of the information from my resume into their application form and hit submit.  The problem with this is that I can't chat with the person doing the hiring, I can't explain why I would want such a simple job, and I can't \"sell\" them on how good I would be at the job since applying is all done by filling in or checking little boxes on the form.Then I had to apply for each job separately.  I ended up applying for eight jobs, everything from cashier, to food service worker, and various types of these two positions.  I didn't apply for cook (I can't really cook very well) and didn't apply for janitor (I'm squeamish about cleaning up messes).  Since these were temporary positions there was no waitress or bartender positions which probably pay a lot better (thank goodness, the waitresses wear lace teddys for their outfits and I would look frightful!) so I just applied for low-paying menial work which actually I think will be fun (and of course which I will blog about because I kind of think working for minimum wage may not really be worth it after taxes, etc but we shall see).I hope they pick me!  I'm not sure if they have an overabundance of applications or are desperately seeking more applicants (I'm thinking it is the former with a jobless rate of 20+% here) but it would be something fun to do and hubby will be there playing poker for the duration of the tournament anyway so we can ride to and from the casino together which would save on gas.Maybe it is just me or maybe I am getting old but I don't really like applying for jobs online.  No wonder people seem to have such a difficult time getting jobs.  Of course these are difficult economic times for finding a job, but the old fashioned way of having people give you a job because you look capable and responsible has apparently gone by the wayside.  Hmmmm"},
{"title": "A Rant About the American Healthcare System", "date": "Wednesday, May 16, 2012", "text": "If you are a Canadian reader, you can probably skip this post and bask in the comfort of your universal medical care that comes compliments of your government and your taxes.  If you are an American, this post will probably be like preaching to the choir but I feel ranty so here goes...A few months ago I had a sudden, weird, medical condition that sent me immediately to the hospital ER to find out what was wrong with me.  Now, a few months later, I get the fallout from that hospital visit, namely a massive amount of bills.In a nutshell, my body was feeling weird, I didn't think I was critical or anything, but since I was out of the area for my insurance they told me to go to the closest ER.  I Googled the symptoms before I went to the hospital and found that many people have this problem but none have been able to get an actual diagnosis for it.  So I go into the ER in the evening and wait...and wait...  They take some blood and ask some questions and the ER doc tells me they need to do some tests because it could be a heart problem or a brain problem (note that ER docs are mostly there to put people back together in trauma cases, or in cases where the problem isn't evident, rule out things that can immediately kill you like a heart attack or stroke, and then send you on your way). So they say they can admit me and I can stay over night (in the ER, the rest of the hospital was full) then get the tests done in the morning.  I decided to go home (and save my insurance company from paying for my overnight stay) then I came back at 6am the next morning.  I was there the entire day--for like 12 hours--and they performed about 30 minutes worth of tests (CAT scan, MRI, vein ultrasound, and EKG).  Five doctors came in and checked on me, and one even pointed out that she had seen this problem a couple of times before but she doubted if they would be able to give me a diagnosis. Um...OK.  After many, many hours in the ER, they sent me home with a \"we don't know what is wrong with you but we don't think you will die from it\" (I'm paraphrasing) type of farewell.  So to this day I still have the same on and off symptoms and I have mostly just gotten used to ignoring it.Then yesterday I got the bill in the mail for my ER stay and nearly fainted.  Fortunately (and this is huge), I will only have to pay $25 for the entirety of my care in the ER because I have exceptionally good and exceptionally cheap insurance, BUT I am horrified that sixteen hours spent waiting in the ER twiddling my thumbs cost over $20,000(!!!).  Like the hubby said, if we had been average, hardworking, wage-earning people, this visit to the ER would have bankrupted us!  Which is a really scary thing because there are so many average, hardworking, wage-earning people out there without health insurance who could easily find themselves in such a situation.  One little trip to the ER for something that seems like it could be serious could send a person spiraling down into debt that they can never get out of.  That is horrible!!!Sadly, Googling your symptoms to find out if what is wrong with you is serious enough to warrant a hospital visit (generally a really bad way to determine if or what kind of medical care you need) is sometime's people's only option.  Obviously something needs to be done to fix this problem before people die from lack of care (I've actually seen this happen a few times as clients we worked with felt they couldn't afford care so they stayed home and tried to take care of themselves.  One young guy ended up dying from undiagnosed, untreated late stage cancer and a woman barely survived an internal hemorrhage that she though was a stomach ache).Obama has tried to fix the problem of so many Americans without health insurance with his \"Obamacare\" universal insurance plan but unfortunately it wasn't very well thought out (the plan would insist that people buy health insurance but if people could afford health insurance they would already be paying for it! Duh).To top it off, I checked the print out of my bill (see photos) and it listed a whole bunch of IV drugs it said that I received however I didn't receive anything other than one baby aspirin (which the hospital charged $3 for!  Hubby said he could have ran to Walmart and bought me two bottles of baby aspirin for that price!). So while my insurance paid the entire bill without question, I did request a review of my records so my insurance company could get reimbursed for the treatment they paid for that I didn't receive.  I also called my insurance company to point out the mistake but they didn't seem very concerned, in fact the lady said that if I wanted to I could talk to the hospital about it and the hospital would probably send them a revised bill.  If I had paid out thousands more than necessary I would have been all over the problem but the giant insurance company didn't seem worried about it.So that is my long and disjointed rant about the state of American medical care.  Medical care itself is excellent in the US buy paying astronomical prices for that care, prices that the average person can't afford, often leaves people the choice of not seeking care that they know they can't afford (and risking everything up to and including death) or seeking care (at US ERs they must treat you even if you can't pay.  They will, however, bill you for every single moment of your stay and send the bills to collections if you don't pay up afterwards) and then having to file bankruptcy no matter how hard they have worked over their lifetime and how good they have been about paying their bills and staying out of debt.  That isn't much of a choice at all."},
{"title": "Some Thoughts on Huge Life Changes", "date": "Monday, May 14, 2012", "text": "You may want to get a cup of coffee before settling down to read this.  I think this is the longest post I've ever written!On my last post, I received this comment from Lorraine who is getting ready to make a big change and move herself and her family to Florida soon.  \"What if we never live this well again? What if we move and hubby gets a job that doesn't pay well or if he loses it? Or if he can't find a job at all? We desperately want a change, but at the same time we are afraid things won't work out the way we hope. Did you go through a mourning period when you gave up your big house, your old life and all your stuff?\"A year and a half ago we did something similar by selling nearly everything we owned, including our house, then hitting the road to travel with no particular destination in mind.  It was a pretty big change now that I look back on it...First, the impetus to totally change our lifestyle was kind of thrust on us which is a bit different than making a conscious decision to give up everything and move.  At the time, housing prices were sinking like a rock and my biggest work contract was coming to a dramatic end so our choice was to make a drastic change or try to keep up the status quo.  That meant that I could scramble for work and keep paying big house payments on a house that was losing value every month or we could sell quickly and get some equity out of the house then use that to pay off our debts so we could be debt free.  That choice also meant that we would end up basically homeless.  On the other hand, being homeless and debt free would immediately increase our net worth from a big minus figure to at least a small positive figure.  Also, at about the same time, some of our friends were literally dropping dead.  These were people who had everything and lived very well and had plans to travel a lot more \"when they retired.\"  Unfortunately they died.  That was pretty profound in and of itself.  Since the hubby is 20 years older than I am, I realized that we wanted--make that needed--to spend more time together and do the things we had planned on doing \"later\" NOW.So with a lot of convincing of the hubby (he is pretty much a home body and doesn't like change) we decided to give it a shot (I have no idea what got into him, even five years before this he would have been adamant about not changing anything but I hit him with the above info--repeatedly--and he relented).After that, everything moved too quickly to give us much time to worry about anything.  It was like a three-ring circus at our house what with potential buyers coming and going, weekly garage sales, and nearly daily CraigsList sales.  By the closing date we had some stuff in storage, our backpacks packed, and one way tickets to the hubby's sister's house in Atlanta which was going to be our first stop on our trip to where ever (we ended up staying there for nearly five months to help here with her grandkids).  From there we went to Las Vegas for a couple of weeks, went back to Seattle to stay with a cousin for a couple of months, then went to Japan and the Philippines.  When we were in Las Vegas the cousin we were staying with said we really ought to buy a place there since homes were sooooo cheap.  She immediately produced a realtor who showed us around and, especially since hubby is a poker player, we decided that a super inexpensive home base in Las Vegas, even if we kept traveling, would be better than putting up with another cold, rainy winter in Seattle.So after the Philippines, we packed up a moving truck and drove our van and a few household goods to Las Vegas.  We put our stuff into a storage unit in Vegas, stayed with another cousin for a month, then yet another cousin offered us a great deal on her vacation condo so that we would have a place to stay until we bought a house.  After much looking (and 14 offers on homes) we are now on the verge of moving into our new house.  Yeah!Getting back to Lorraine's questions...What if we never live this well again?  Unless hubby wins a big poker jackpot or I get a big book deal, we will never live as well as we did before.  However \"live as well\" is very subjective.  I don't really want to live like we did before because it required debt (and lots of it) to maintain that lifestyle.  It also required a lot of time apart for us since we were both working, and it required a mad consumer scramble just to keep up appearances (a $500 purse just to keep up appearances...what the heck was I thinking???).  Now I am quite happy to buy my clothes at the Goodwill (when I buy a shirt for $1.50 at the Goodwill I always ask myself if I would rather work three hours to be able to afford a similar shirt at Macy's and the answer is always no way), and while I do want a new car, I again ask myself if I want to saddle myself with a 40 hour a week job to be able to afford it (again, the answer is no way).  Overall I am really happy with a much more scaled down lifestyle and I honestly think we are living better--if you discount the material goods--than we were before.What if we move and hubby gets a job that doesn't pay well or if he loses it?  Now this is definitely a question to worry about.  We were fortunate in that even without working, hubby had a military pension and a social security check coming in each month.  Because we no longer had housing costs or debt payments, my salary was no longer needed to make ends meet and we could easily live on just hubby's income.  If this wasn't the case, we would have definitely been a lot more worried about having some sort of income coming in.  I've noticed that many people who have changed their life dramatically often start some sort of online/portable business ahead of time so at least they have some money coming in.  Plus if your bills are super minimal, you will need lots less income than it took to support your previous lifestyle..Or if he can't find a job at all?  This is the case in Las Vegas.  Jobs are very hard to find here and my friends who moved here a few months ago are still scrambling to find odd jobs to support themselves.  Again, I think with some creativity (Lorraine already has a wonderful eBay business going) and being open to a different lifestyle (living way below the typical American lifestyle but enjoying yourself none the less), you may not even need a regular job.We desperately want a change, but at the same time we are afraid things won't work out the way we hope.  This is where I was as far back as a couple of years before we moved.  I felt like something had to change because while I was used to our lifestyle, since it was the only thing I had ever known, I also felt there had to be more to life than working, paying bills, buying more stuff, etc,  It was a horrible, \"typical American lifestyle\" that literally killed my mother in her mid 50s.  But I was, for some unknown reason, very optimistic that things would work out somehow, and that starting from scratch, as opposed to deep in debt, would put us at a place to restart our life after traveling (with a last resort fall back plan of living in the jungles of the Philippines on $500 a month if things didn't work out!). Did you go through a mourning period when you gave up your big house, your old life and all your stuff?  Oddly enough, getting rid of everything felt like a big, giant relief to me.  Then again I am not sentimental at all and I don't get attached to material things either.  Literally our house could burn down and as long as the hubby and I were safe I would be thinking \"oh well, on to the next adventure.\"  Weird huh?  Also, now that we are settling back in to a normal lifestyle, we have learned that all of our material items are infinitely replaceable (preferably from a Thrift Store as we learned that our expensive department store decor items were actually worth pennies on the dollar when it came time to sell them).  It also felt good to get off the work roller coaster for a while, and it felt especially good that people weren't depending on me so much (I had a business, a separate non profit, and volunteered for a half dozen community Boards and people were literally calling me at all hours of the day and night for every conceivable problem).  tl;dr In case you want to skip over the wall of text: you only go around once in life so you should make it as adventurous and entertaining as possible.  I think living like everyone else is highly overrated and you really can't make yourself step up to big challenges, learn how to fail, or be more successful than your wildest dreams if you don't take some (make that many) risks along the way.  Things will work out, somehow, and the way things work out when you start moving towards what you really want in life may surprise and delight you.  Also, you are better than you think you are.  More resourceful, more creative, more determined--but you seldom get to test this in your regular life.  What ever it is that you want, go for it.  Now.  And if you need some inspiration, start here with Nancy's blog."},
{"title": "Happy Mother's Day...And Some Useful Information", "date": "Sunday, May 13, 2012", "text": "First of all, Happy Mother's Day!!  And that goes out to all of you who have an impact on a child's life--moms, step moms, foster moms, aunts, concerned neighbors, teachers, and even single dads who are doing the job of both parents.  Here's a nice flower for you...And some more info:I always check out the 'frugal' sub-reddit which has lots of interesting and useful information (check the side bar on the page too for other great money saving links).From the frugal sub-reddit I saw the reminder that now is an excellent trash picking time as many college students are moving out of their dorms and apartments and heading back home for the summer.  If you live in a college town, you might want to go to the dumpsters at your university and see what the kids have throw out (often lots of great stuff!).Have you checked your credit report lately?  You can get your free credit reports from the major three reporting companies at www.annualcreditreport.com.  (I was reminded of this because our lender just pulled our credit reports for our mortgage loan.  They were fine but he noted that my credit score was low because I don't use credit cards.  I told him that was just the way I wanted it.  Hubby uses his cards on occasion and pays them off each month so his credit scores are better than mine but nothing can get me to go back to using credit!I saw this article and it gave me some interesting business ideas (I have decided that I need to set up some sort of business because I am bored silly doing nothing!).Have a wonderful day!"},
{"title": "A Day Full of Errands (Money Lessons Included)", "date": "Thursday, May 10, 2012", "text": "Yesterday we did what we often do about once a week and that is to group all of our errands together and knock them off all at once.  This not only saves money on gas but also time.  Here's what we did:We started bright and early by being the first people at Great Clips when they opened in the morning.  I had fished out two coupons from the \"junk mail\" that we received a couple of weeks back so hubby and I each paid $6.95 for our haircuts with the coupons.After showering the cut hair off we then went to Walmart where I picked up hair color for $6.95 (this saves me a ton of money over paying a salon to color my hair).Next we hit the Dollar Store and picked up everything from snacks to vegetables to a notebook for me (I always carry a notebook with me for to do lists, story ideas, etc).Then we headed off down the street and stopped by the library where hubby picked up a dozen movies and I picked up a couple of books (free is a very good price!).In the middle of our errands we stopped by Del Taco and had a quick lunch ($3.98 for both of us to have two tacos each).Next we went to TJ Maxx.  I have a $25 gift card to spend at this store but everything there seemed so expensive and I didn't find anything that I really really wanted so I decided to save the gift card for a later date.Then is was on to the Goodwill.  This place was a zoo!  It was packed with people and you could hardly get through the aisles.  I asked a lady who worked there if it was always like this and she said \"it's senior Wednesday\" which I guess meant that yes, it is always busy on senior Wednesday.  Fortunately hubby is a senior so we picked up a bunch of stuff (a bunch of clothes for me, a cover for our futon, two framed picture for our future kitchen and some organizer bins) for a grand total of $30!Heading back home we stopped by one of our favorite stores, Dollar General, and picked up some groceries,  Fortunately we got there at just the right time and all of their chicken and pork was half off so we stocked up on meat as well as some other items, including a super tasty watermelon.  Buying food here is MUCH cheaper than at a regular grocery store.Finally, our last stop was at the mortgage company where we signed some loan documents for our new house.  We got an unfortunate surprise in that we had to hand over $450 for the appraisal and then were informed that we would need to pay around $1300 additional for closing costs.  We weren't expecting either of these fees because the last time we bought a house all of these fees were paid for by the seller which, because this is a bank owned house, isn't happening this time.  Bummer.So that's a typical day of errands for us.  We try to save money on everything from shopping sales to using coupons to hitting up the library for free entertainment."},
{"title": "20 Things About Our New House", "date": "Tuesday, May 8, 2012", "text": "We had the inspection of our new house yesterday and I am cautiously optimistic that this sale might actually go through (really I won't believe it until we are actually handed the keys but one can hope!).  Here's some things about our house:We are paying $125,000 for it.  This is a little more than double what we first expected to pay for a house here back when everyone was raving about the great $50,000 houses you could buy in Las Vegas at the height of the market downturn (they forgot to mention that trying to outbid cash investors on these super cheap houses is nearly impossible!). We put $1,500 down on the house (and hope to get some of that money applied to the principle since the seller is paying all of our closing costs).We got the inspection done yesterday.  The cost was supposed to be $340 but the company said they would do it for $300 and then when the inspector arrived at the house and we told him he had done an inspection on a condo we were supposed to buy almost a year ago he said he would do the inspection for $250!  He also raved about what great condition the house is in so that's a good thing.We have a great view of the Strip and our master balcony overlooks a nice park full of palm trees.The house is bigger than we wanted to buy--it is three bedrooms and three baths as opposed to the two bedroom, two bath home we were looking to buy here.On the plus side, we will have plenty of room for guests (and we seem to have had a bunch of these lately!).It's a house and not a condo which I think is a very good thing.  Houses also tend to hold their value better than condos plus you don't end up with noisy upstairs neighbors like we currently have (we just turn the TV up to drown out their noise).It isn't in a gated community.  I pretty much detest gated communities so was really happy that this home isn't in one.It is part of an HOA.  Fortunately the monthly HOA fees are low but I really can't understand why every house in Vegas has to be in an HOA instead of having the city and county doing the job of maintaining the streets and landscaping.  Weird.The yard is big with fruit trees and roses and flowers and the perfect space for a garden spot!The back yard is also big enough for a clothesline which I am going to have hubby put up as soon as we move in.  It costs an arm and a leg here to dry clothes in the dryer so for the first time in my life I am going to try to dry all of our clothes outdoors just like my grandmother used to do.The house is in excellent, move-in ready condition with all new paint and new flooring (this wasn't the case with many of the houses we looked at previously which would have taken over $5,000 worth of improvements before we would even want to move into them).  Needless to say, hubby is a very happy camper.The neighborhood is excellent.  We drove around the neighborhood a bit and it really is a great location.We have already started buying stuff for the house.  None of the bedrooms have ceiling fans in them (a necessity in this hot climate) so today we found nice enough ceiling fans at Walmart for $21.98 each so we bought three.Because the house is bank owned they won't do anything to the house to help it pass the appraisal or inspection so when we noticed that all of the smoke detectors were missing, we bought five new ones, had our realtor let us into the house before the inspector got there yesterday, and quickly installed them (we didn't want to miss out on this great house because of $50 worth of smoke detectors... obviously if the sale falls through we are going back to uninstall them!).The house has a bunch of things we aren't familiar with--gas appliances, a water softener system, a yard irrigation system, etc.  I am sure we will figure out how these things work eventually.We still plan to keep our expenses as low as possible.  I believe our TV antennas will work so we won't need to get cable.  There won't be any internet so I will be getting online at the library most likely instead of paying for cable internet at the house.  We will do everything we can to keep our electric, gas, and water bills as low as possible, etc.  Eventually we will look into solar power for the house (but I understand this has a big up front cost to get started).We have talked about \"flipping\" the house.  If prices on houses go up here like they are expected to, the hubby and I talked about selling the house as soon as it builds up $100,000 in equity.  We would then take this money and buy a smaller place.  Obviously this is a crap shoot because who knows which direction house values will go here.We will furnish and decorate the house...slowly.  It would be nice to have $10,000 to go spend to furnish and decorate the house as soon as we move in but since that isn't going to happen we will just furnish and decorate it as the money comes in (which means we may be sitting on the floor for a while until we have the cash to buy a sofa).  We are also going to keep the cost of doing this to a minimum (as we learned when we had our massive garage sales when we sold our last house, the things we buy to decorate the house with--art work, trinkets, etc--are worth literally pennies on the dollar when you go to resell the items at a garage sale).We will try not to shop too much at home decor places.  We were at Pier One Imports a few days ago and were lusting over all of the cuuuuttee things they had to make the house look so beautiful.  We will try to restrain ourselves (mostly by not shopping very much and hitting up the Goodwill for things we need for the house first).So for now we are waiting for the process to move through all of the steps needed until the house closes but overall we are super happy with the house and will be super excited when we get the go-ahead to move in!"},
{"title": "Three More Goals Knocked Off!", "date": "Sunday, May 6, 2012", "text": "Just a quick update...here are three more goals that I have knocked off the list (and still, I can't believe I am actually completing the 30 goals in 30 days that I set for myself and I haven't quit yet!!).First, I went on a volksmarch yesterday.  I absolutely love volksmarching--the people you meet are fascinating and you get to chat with a bunch of people for the two hours or so it takes to complete the 10k walk.  Plus you get to traverse neighborhoods and trails that you never knew existed as the clubs like to put together wonderful walks that highlight their area (like this picture below where we walked...who would have known that the flash flood channel would be so beautifully landscaped?!).And then this morning I headed downtown to do the reddit meet up which is also on the goal list.  Last month I tried to meet up with this group but I couldn't figure out which people at the coffeehouse were with the group--I asked a few people and they had no idea what I was talking about--so I just left.  This morning there were only three people in the whole place and I waited for a bit, even asked the other people if they were redditors, and no luck.  So while I didn't accomplish this goal, I did make the effort (twice!) so I am scratching it off my list.  Here is a picture I took just outside of the coffee shop.Finally, 'interview a stranger' is on my goal list.  As I was exiting the coffee shop this morning I ran into this nice couple.  The lady started talking to me so I thought 'why not interview her?' since this is still one of my goals.  So we stood there and chatted for a while and I found out a bunch of things about her.  She is from Louisiana, she finds that people in Las Vegas aren't nearly as friendly as people in the south (I completely agree with that sentiment!), her boyfriend is a veteran, they seem to be a bit down and out right now, and she hopes to live with her daughter in Texas soon.  One nice thing about Las Vegas is that many people are very nice and friendly in person.  Also I've noticed that the Fremont area is a really good place to strike up a conversation with people.  Another sentiment expressed by the lady, and which I totally agree with, is that Vegas can be very hard on people who come here with little and hope to make a good life for themselves."},
{"title": "Two More Goals Checked Off...And a Bunch of Other Stuff", "date": "Friday, May 4, 2012", "text": "I have kind of been slacking on the goals lately because I have been hammering away on the book but I did manage to get two more things checked off the list:Yesterday I crashed a convention (kind of).  Conveniently there was a Fire Rescue Med conference upstairs at the Orleans Casino where the hubby was playing poker so I walked up to the conference center and wandered around like I belonged there (just a few years ago I would have actually belonged there with a name tag and official registration and all).  It looked a bit sparse compared to similar conferences I used to attend in Las Vegas but other than that, it looked surprisingly the same (break out sessions, a table full of snacks, a vendors area).  I didn't sit in on any of the break out sessions but I did wander through the vendors area for a bit.Today we went to the First Friday Arts Walk which was really interesting (and had plenty of photo ops!).And the bunch of other things...I thought this article was interesting.I gave myself a pedicure!  My heels were really dry and rough but I didn't want to part with $30 to get a real pedicure so I went to Walmart and bought one of those \"cheese grater\" type foot sanders (it was only $1.85 at Walmart!).  I then soaked my feet for a bit, lathered them up with soap, and grated away.  Surprisingly my feet came out really nice and smooth (instead of looking like, well, a bloody mass like I kind of imagined they would).  I then rubbed on some coconut oil on them and I have very happy feet now.Tomorrow I am going to do a Volksmarch.  I used to walk with a couple of Seattle-area Volksmarch groups and I wanted to get involved with a group here so this is another goal on my list.  I did find out, however, that this group doesn't walk in June, July, or August here in Vegas, probably because it is too hot.Great news!  Our realtor called and said we finally got a signed contract for the house so I can go ahead and order the inspection and appraisal.  Yeah!Finally, a rant.  I swear, the people in Las Vegas are going to give me a heart attack or something.  In addition to all of the people who can go from sweet to homicidal in the blink of an eye as soon as they hop into their cars, today we were driving down a busy road where traffic was going at least 50 miles per hour and not one, not two, but three people, on a bike, a skateboard, and a pair of rollerblades, thought they could jet across six lanes of fast moving traffic and somehow not get killed.  Fortunately they didn't get killed but cars had to swerve or slam on their brakes to avoid all three people.  Yikes!"},
{"title": "Yet Another Update", "date": "Wednesday, May 2, 2012", "text": "I would love to report on the goals I have been accomplishing but my goal on Monday was to write a book in 24 hours which I did.  Kind of.  I guess you really can't write an entire book in 24 hours but I did give it a good shot and got about 50% finished.  Then I worked on it again yesterday.  And I will continue to work on it today.  I hope that by the end of this month it will be ready to publish (thanks to a blog reader I am looking into CreateSpace on Amazon to publish it).  So I skipped completing other goals yesterday and today to work on the book but I plan to jump back on the goal wagon tomorrow by attending a Jelly meet up.On the money side, nothing interesting is happening there either.  We got an email from the bank that is selling the house we want stating that they accepted our offer over a week ago but since then have heard absolutely nothing and we don't want to pay for an inspection or appraisal without a legally binding contract in our hands so we are on perma-hold for now with the house.Also on the money side, I realized today that I have been concentrating so much on my goal list that I haven't done anything productive (ie money-making) in a while so I need to get some articles written and sold so I will have a bit of income next month.In other words my life is quite boring at the moment otherwise I would have something interesting to blog about! I hope you are having a great week!p.s. Here is a picture of a cactus taken at the Springs Preserve.  They are the funniest looking cactuses (cacti?)

Here's my favorite authors).Having everything I need.  I honestly have everything I need at this point in my life, and in fact, I need very few things these days to be happy and content.  I am glad I got to this point in my life sooner rather than later.Being safe.  Living in a city, any city, but most of the news I hear daily is about Las Vegas, you hear  about A LOT of dangerous things.  Many of these things (murder, domestic violence, human trafficking, gang fights, et al) have a lot to do with your lifestyle and environment.  I am grateful to live in a very healthy, positive, and safe environment.Flowers.  I miss all of the living things--plants, trees, flowers, even soil--in the Pacific Northwest.  I am always happy, however, when I run across living, blooming flowers in Las Vegas.  Nice!Friends.  Whether I talk to them on the phone or meet them in person or receive an unexpected email from a friend, it reminds me yet again how grateful I am to have people that care about me.The fact that things always work out well in the end.  There are always difficulties and challenges popping up--some minor, some major, many annoying but fixable--but it always seems like things work out well in the end.What are you grateful for this week?"},
{"title": "Three More Goals Checked Off and A House Update", "date": "Friday, April 27, 2012", "text": "I still can't believe I am knocking out a goal a day on my 30 goals in 30 days challenge.  This is the first time I have ever stuck with a goal challenge this long!  Here's what I've done:Attend a university lecture.  I checked out the UNLV calendar and saw that Tony Hsieh, the founder of Zappos and Las Vegas resident, would be giving a lecture a few days ago.  Fortunately it was free and fortunately it was open to the public instead of just students so I RSVD'ed and was first in line to get a seat to see him.  I'm a fan of all kinds of lectures but was really happy to hear business advice from Tony and Fred, another executive from his company.  He also mentioned that they have a funding project for small businesses in downtown Las Vegas so I immediately called a friend who is looking into setting up a business there.  This was a wonderful opportunity to enjoy a free event, learn some good information, meet someone famous, and fulfill one of my goals.Yesterday I was supposed to do the free hugs thing on Las Vegas Blvd but I chickened out.  UNLV students were doing the event and while it was supposed to be for students only I thought me and my friend would just go and blend in then my friend backed out and then I chickened out.  I am sure I will get this goal knocked out by the end of the challenge.  Sometime.  So instead of this, another goal of mine was to apply to UNLV so I can finish my bachelor's degree.  I called to find out how to apply since it wouldn't let me do it online and found out that since I wasn't going to attend until January (so I can pay in-state tuition instead of out of state tuition), that I can't apply until September.  They won't even look at my transcripts to see how many more credits I need to graduate until I apply and am approved.  Bummer.  But this takes the goal off my list for now.Today hubby and I hiked the mountains that are to the west of the city.  We drive by these (very) small, rocky hills quite a bit and I always said that sometime I want to hike up and see the caves which are dug into the mountain, which is how this goal ended up on my list.  It was a short, 20 minute hike up, we looked around a bit, took some pictures, and then hiked down.  The pictures are at the top of this post (including the view of The Strip from the top).And a quick update: I've never seen a home sale move so slowly in my life.  Nearly two weeks ago we got an email from the bank which said they accepted our offer on the house but since then, nothing.  So we can't move forward with the inspection or appraisal until we get an actual signed contract.  My friend and the realtor both said this is common with bank-owned houses.  Ugh. I want to move in tomorrow!  On a brighter note, hubby called his cousin who is an excellent shopper and home decorator and asked her where she buys furniture and appliances in the city and she said her son just short-saled his house and moved back in with her and he brought his fairly new appliances (washer, dryer, refrigerator) to store in her garage.  She then offered to sell us these appliances for $700 total and we immediately jumped on the offer.  She also threw in a newish table and chairs which she didn't want too.  Wow!  That serendipitous phone called saved us over $2000!!!"},
{"title": "Can I Get That Cheaper???", "date": "Wednesday, April 25, 2012", "text": "Since we are living on a very tight budget, the first thingI ask any time we need to spend money is “how can I get this cheaper than thenormal price?”  Here’s how I have managedto get a whole bunch of things much cheaper than usual… I Google everything.  Coupons (both printable and online), reviews(sometimes reviewers will tell you about particular specials at a restaurant or business), the website of thebusiness I am interested in (by checking out the website, for example, we foundthat the expensive lunch we had was exactly the same as the much more expensivedinner at a restaurant so this saved us $50 on the meal), competitor’s websites(I’ve found drastic price differences between the major bookseller’s websitesjust by checking both before ordering).I watch for signs.  A few days ago we were at the Goodwill and abig sign on the wall noted that Wednesdays were senior day where all seniorswould get an extra 50% off their purchases. You can be sure I will be dragging my senior (hubby) back to theGoodwill on Wednesday!I always ask for discounts.  I always ask if there is an extra discountfor seniors (hubby), veterans (hubby), locals (me), as well as any otherdiscount I can think of (ie: sometimes late in the day at the swapmeet vendorswill highly discount produce and other items just to clear them out before theyleave).  I ask for discounts if there isa flaw in a clothing item I am buying.  Iask for discounts for larger purchases if I will be paying cash instead ofusing credit.  I ask for discounts on bigthings (cruises) and small things (if I buy a bunch of items at a garagesale).  Always ask, the worst the personcan do is say no.I always comparison shop online.  I know brick and mortar stores hate this butwhenever I see an item I want in a store I always check the price online.  This can save a lot of money and with suchexcellent search engines (I use Google) you may find a much lower price on theitem down the street or across the country (be sure to find out about freeshipping).I keep a written list of specials.  For example, we know that Tuesdays are 99cents for two pieces of chicken day at Popeyes, that Tuesdays are senior day atthe Orleans Casino and Thursdays are senior day at the Palms Casino, and thatSouthpoint Casino offers $4 movies for senior during the day Monday thruFriday.  There are so many specialsaround here, both one-time and permanent-type specials, that I write them downso I won’t forget about them.I ask around. I have some friends that are super shoppers and if there is a bargain tobe found they probably know where to find it so I ask them before I go outblindly searching for an item on my own. I also post to local message boards if I am looking for somethingspecific (where’s a good, cheap car fixing place?) and I try to help people viathe message boards as well (I shared on the board when I found the $40 specialat the dentist and when my friends were able to find a nice $600 apartment ashort walk from the Vegas Strip).I do without, recycle something I already own,repurpose another product, or just wait. Sometimes by waiting you can get the item on sale or clearance insteadof paying full price.  Also, we needed afood cover for the microwave (it keeps the food from splattering all over whenyou microwave the food) we went to the dollar store and found a deep, hardplastic bowl, turned it over, and it makes the perfect cover.  Finally, I got tired of paying a lot of moneyfor body lotion that is full of chemicals I can’t even pronounce so I went tothe store and bought a big jar of coconut oil and it works so well tomoisturize my skin (plus the $5 jar will probably last for more than a year!)Just in the last week or so we have been able to get thefollowing specials just by doing a bit of research or asking: $5 off theFremont zipline by going there before 5pm, a $10 lifetime pass to all NationalParks because hubby is a senior (we saw a sign about this when we went to RedRock Canyon; the regular entry fee was $7 per car but the next line said thatthe unlimited use, forever senior pass was only $10. Wow what a deal!).  $100 off the cost of the crown from mydentist because I paid cash.  An $8savings at the Goodwill because we were there on blue and white tag day so welooked specifically for these colored tags in order to save 25% off the regulartag price.Next time you need to spend money ask yourself how you canget the product cheaper.  You may beamazed at what you come up with!"},
{"title": "Two More Goals Checked Off and Why You Must Write Down Your Goals", "date": "Tuesday, April 24, 2012", "text": "I am quickly working through my list of 30 goals in 30 days(and no one is more surprised about this than me!).  Here’s my recently completed goals:Yesterday I played poker in a real live gamewith the hubby at Orleans Casino.  WhileI know how to play poker (kind of), I hadn’t played a game in about fouryears.  Unfortunately it took me all of18 minutes to blow $20 at which point my goal had been completed so I slunk offto read my book in the casino food court while hubby continued to play.  It was a bit of fun, and I actually won thefirst pot of the game, but for me, playing poker takes way too muchthought.  I have to think about my cards,the other nine player’s cards, my strategy, everyone else’s strategy, if I haveany tells, reading other people’s tells…whew that is too much work to befun!  Plus I am sure I annoyed the otherplayers because there is no method to my madness when it comes to betting andstrategy and knowing when to fold ‘em (which, obviously I didn’t because I lostso quickly).  Overall I am glad this wason my goal list but that will probably be the last time I play for quite awhile.Today we went to Red Rock Canyon.  It was soooo beautiful and sooounexpected—when you think of Las Vegas you rarely think about such an amazingpiece of nature being so nearby.  Evenhubby said “wow” at the amazing view and he never “wows” about nature.And this is why you absolutely must write down your goals:when you do this, something in the universe actually helps you to complete yourgoals! I don’t know how and I don’t know why, and I doubt if it has beenscientifically proven, but whenever I write down things I want todo/see/experience/have, I noticed I have a much better chance of actuallydoing/seeing/experiencing/having these things than if I just kept them in myhead.  Here’s some examples:I’ve always wanted to do a “free hugs” thing ona busy street.  When I wrote it down, Ihad no idea if I would be brave enough to actually do such a thing.  Fast forward to yesterday when I was checkingout the UNLV calendar and it turns out that on Thursday UNLV students andothers will be gathered on The Strip giving out free hugs.  Guess who will be joining them?Way back when, when I made up this list, Ireally wanted to see the Grand Canyon but had no idea how to pull this offbecause I figure it will be a kind of expensive goal.  I had no idea that all national parks arefree this week which will waive the $25 entry fee that we would have had topay.  I believe we will be doing thisgoal at the end of the week.I’m kind of a fan of university lectures so Iwrote “attend a university lecture” on my list. I had no idea I would get to see Tony Hsieh (he’s an entrepreneurialrockstar and founder of Zappos), in person with the purpose of helping othersbecome entrepreneurs.  I found thislecture/event on the UNLV website and I am RSVPed for the event tomorrowafternoon.Finally, I also made up a giant wish list ofstuff I want and need and I am making surprising headway on that list aswell.  Just today an unexpected $75landed in my mail box (it was a rebate from a couple of months ago that Itotally forgot about) which will be put towards acquiring some of the things onmy list.THAT is why you must write down your goals…they really willcome true!"},
{"title": "It's Sunday and I'm Grateful For...", "date": "Sunday, April 22, 2012", "text": "...much more than I could ever list here, but these are the highlights for the week...Amazing feats of engineering.  We went to the Hoover Dam yesterday (one of the 30 goals) and I was stunned at what human beings can do when they put their mind to something.  Truly an amazing feat of engineering.Being able to achieve my goals.  First, I am fortunate to live in a country where so much is attainable for so many (this isn't the case in many countries).  Plus you know how personally lousy I am about achieving the goals I set but this week has really encouraged me to at least try and reach a month's worth of goals (p.s. the brownies in the picture above are for my \"random act of kindness\" goal and I will deliver them to the staff of a local hospital ER this afternoon).Nice people.  Every once in a while I run in to truly nice people, like the lady at the cemetery this week or a lady I met at the library (we were sitting at the same table and struck up a very nice conversation for like 45 minutes and I didn't even get her name), or a nice lady at the casino a few weeks back who chatted with me for an hour while our husbands were playing.  Nice people just make the world brighter.Being able to talk to the hubby about money.  Years ago we each had our own money and we each spent like maniacs and we never ever talked about money.  After we got on the Dave Ramsey bandwagon and started working as a team to conquer our bills, our relationship improved dramatically and now we easily talk about money and every other little thing.  This week our money talks have been around prioritizing.  You saw that huge wish list I posted yesterday?  Well some things we can easily afford, other things would need a minor miracle to fulfill, but most of the things we need end up being prioritized so that we pay for them with cash as we earn the money.  This week's discussion was about which was a higher priority, buying a clothes washer or getting the car air conditioning fixed (I voted for the car AC, hubby voted for the washer).  We haven't decided which will come first but at least we are easily able to talk about such things and work towards a common goal.Our offer to buy a house was accepted.  It took 14 tries and I still won't believe it until we are handed the keys but I am grateful we will finally have our own home soon!People who are generous with their times, skills, and/or money.  This week were were really blessed by my sister in law who gave us a wonderful lunch and a Vegas show for our birthdays.  I called up another friend because the code I was working on for a website was messed up and I couldn't figure it out. He FTPed the site to his computer, made some changes in all of two minutes, and \"ta da\" it was fixed!  I always appreciate when people are generous towards me so I try to be generous towards others...it's a nice circle of good karma.The warm weather.  Actually the weather this week is very hot (like 99 degrees!), but I am very grateful that we didn't have to suffer through a cold, rainy, snowy winter in Seattle this past year.Paper and pens.  I am grateful someone invented notebooks and pens.  I always carry these two items with me because while I use the computer for mostly everything, I do my best thinking on paper and I am grateful that these two simple items were invented!Amazing bloggers.  It seems like the world has both expanded and contracted over the past few decades.  In Las Vegas I have very few friends but by visiting the many blogs that I read each day (sorry, I'm a little lazy about commenting!) I feel like I have \"friends\" all over the world which greatly expands my social circle (plus I love learning new things and I learn SO MUCH from what other people write about in their blogs).People coming to visit us.  We will pick up a friend who is coming to Las Vegas this afternoon at the airport.  We have truly never had as many people come and visit us as we have since we moved to Las Vegas (I'm thinking the destination is more the draw than us!) and it is wonderful to be able to have friends visit, act as a tour guide, and make people's vacations here a little easier if possible.That's it for this week.  What are you grateful for?"},
{"title": "50 Resources for When You Need Medical Care", "date": "Saturday, April 21, 2012", "text": "Since I'm in a listy mood today and also because this question has come up about a half dozen times on one of the message boards I frequent and since I used to work in social services where we would need to hunt down medical care for people who couldn't afford it (yes, we are envious of our Canadian friend's medical care system!) I thought I would share this list of resources for medical care options for people who don't have many.  Here goes:See if there is a free/sliding scale/community health clinic in your area.And check here too.And here.For free and low cost prescriptions check here.There are more prescription assistance programs at the bottom of this page.There is a national program that offers free mammograms and pap tests for women who qualify.You can call 211 or go to www.211.org for local info on free and low cost medical services in your immediate area.Call your local university or college and see if they offer any sort of medical or dental care (some of these programs need patients to practice on so they offer low cost or even free care--supervised by a real doctor or dentist, of course).Know that certified hospitals in the US can't turn an emergency patient away from their hospital, they must stabilize the patient and offer some sort of basic treatment before releasing you even if you can't pay.Obviously in an emergency situation you should go to the ER (you will get a bunch of huge bills later for this visit).  If this happens to you, ask the hospital about their charity care program and about making payment arrangements (some people pay $10 a month towards their debt if that's all they can afford which is better than having the bills sent to collections).If you need quick but not emergency medical care, consider going to an urgent care clinic instead of the ER (the visit will be much cheaper).Check out what services your county and state department of health offer.  Services may range from vaccinations and well baby programs to STD testing and free child safety seats.Also ask this question of your local fire department (fire departments where we used to live used to provide free diabetic and blood pressure checks if you dropped by the fire house).Keep your eyes peeled for health fairs in your communities.  We used to run annual health fairs and would provide a huge range of free medical services (medical, STD, and pregnancy testing, dental check ups, vaccinations, etc).  These events were usually well publicized by the local media.If you are elderly, low income, or otherwise in need, go to your local welfare office and see what programs you qualify for (medical coupons, WIC, well baby care, food stamps, etc).If you are a veteran, check with your local Veteran's Service Center and VA hospital and see what kind of care you qualify for.  Check back with these places on occasion since programs and funding change, what isn't offered this year may be offered next year.Contact your local Area Agency on Aging or local senior services center and check out what programs they offer (again, these programs can vary based on grant and other funding for programs).Check current healthcare laws.  For example, college students can remain on their parents health insurance until they are 26 as long as they are in school.I wouldn't actually recommend this but it is an option that some people have chosen.Be a medical tourist.Google your problem.  Obviously if you are in an emergent medical situation, skip the computer and get thee to a hospital but for less emergent problems you might want to Google the problem or post on message boards to gather more information on the problem.Try home remedies.  Again, if you have having a medical crisis, the best place to be is in a hospital, but for many less severe medical issues people have turned to home remedies for centuries.If you have unique medical issues (chronic medical problems, XYZ syndrome), get hooked up with message boards and websites specific to the problem that may carry cutting edge info on the topic (these boards and websites may also alert you when new drugs are released, clinical trials are taking place, etc).Participate in clinical trials.  Again, this isn't something I would recommend without doing a lot of research beforehand.Google low income health care for your city and state. This is what I found for my area.Find a job that provides health insurance (unfortunately these are getting harder and harder to find).Join the military (I've known people who received their first medical care ever when they joined the military!?!  And it's free).Based on your age, sign up for Medicare when you qualify.Based on your disability, sign up for Medicaid if you qualify.Establish a relationship with a private practice doctor (they may charge considerably less than a hospital visit, especially if you pay cash instead of making payments).Sign up for catastrophic medical insurance (the premium will be much lower than having comprehensive full-care insurance).See if other insurance will cover you (ie: if you were in a car accident, your car insurance may cover your medical care).If you lost your job, see if you are still covered under COBRA.If you are a college student, see what care is covered by your student health center.See if you are covered by other health care plans (ie: a state high-risk plan, a small business association plan, etc).Check out organizations that help the uninsured here and here and here.Ask about bartering.  Usually this works with private practice doctors and dentists.  I once helped a flooring installer barter his services to get his mother false teeth.  It was a win-win for everyone.  There are also more formal arrangements like this.Some good mental health crisis care can be found for free online.  I often recommend this site, this site and this site for people in crisis.Marry someone who has good health insurance.  Obviously this isn't the ONLY reason to marry someone but I've recommended it a couple of times to people in need of healthcare with a SO who had insurance that would cover them after marriage plus I knew that they were already talking marriage (it just speeded up the process and saved the person a lot of uninsured medical care costs).Convenience clinics are starting to pop up these days.  They are even cheaper than urgent care clinics usually.  I just noticed one new chain at Walmart.Piece out your health care.  Vaccination from Walgreens or a similar pharmacy, contraception from Planned Parenthood, etc.See what new legislation will bring.  Obamacare is tied up in the courts right now but if it goes into affect, it will have a massive impact on healthcare in our country.If you are a member of a tribe, see what services are available at your tribal clinic (if you are American Indian and not registered with a tribe but can get registered, this may be one option so that you will qualify for healthcare).Consider opening a Health Savings Account (this isn't much help if you need help NOW but over time adding money to this account can help with major medical expenses).Last resort: holding fundraisers, adding donation links to your website, making your cause go viral (people do this who need major medical care when there is no way they would be able to pay for it themself such as a kidney transplant, etc).Seek out specialized care (such as free care for children with burns or orthopedic needs at Shriner's Hospital or receiving vision care from Lions Clubs).Check out peripheral resources (such as the local Hospice organization for end of life care, CraigsList for cheaper used medical goods such as hospital beds and wheelchairs, and Compassionate Friends for support after a child has died).Some people make trips to Canada or Mexico to buy prescription meds much cheaper than they can find in the US.  Ditto for ordering medications online.  I tend not to recommend this because it can be illegal if not downright dangerous (when you buy pills online from who knows who is selling them you could be getting sugar pills for all you know).Ask for free things.  Doctors often give free sample medication to patients, my dentist recently gave me a free set of xrays and exam because he knew I would be back to have a crown done, a friend (somehow) talking his doctor into giving his a free biopsy for what was thought to be cancer (it wasn't but how he got a surgery suite for free was beyond me).Random stuff (not that I necessarily recommend these things and in fact they all sound illegal but I've heard of people doing this): using veterinary grade medications to treat themselves (no prescription needed), using a friend's health insurance card to get care (illegal and clinics are getting wise to this), having a baby with a midwife instead of in a hospital to save money, having doctors and dentists from other countries perform procedures on them here in the US (these people are unlicensed and while the price can be cheaper, the cost of someone's life due to infection or a botched procedure isn't worth it in my book), staying super healthy through nutrition and exercise so they won't need to go to the doctor.Yikes, I'm rereading this list and the state of American medical care looks pretty pitiful indeed.  Unfortunately as more and more people become uninsured this is often how they piece together healthcare for themselves and their family.  It's pretty scary.  It's pretty pathetic (especially for a country that provides massive amounts of funding to other countries to help people there while our own people can literally die in the gutter because they can't get basic health care).The bottom line is that if you are having a healthcare emergency, get to a hospital for care and worry about the bills later.  Your life is that important.  Sometimes I just get overwhelmed with all of the things that we need.  It seems like some weeks there are very few things we need and other weeks things start breaking down or running out and then the list of stuff we want/need seems to grow exponentially over night.  I know I should probably just get a job to cover these things and it is a really, really good thing I don't have a credit card (because I would be sooo tempted to use it on these things) but today I am going to try something that I often do when there is a lot of things I want and not a lot of money to buy them, I will write out my \"wish list\" then hand it over to the universe to take care of.  After a month I will let you know which things somehow got bought/acquired, most likely through very little effort of my own.  I have done this many times before and oddly enough, even when I am flat broke, the things I want and need often come to me anyway.  It's quite magical!  Here goes:Book of stamps (I just ran out)Surgiwax (my sister put my wax in the microwave for THREE minutes, needless to say the whole thing including the plastic tub melted into a big heap)Coconut oil (my skin is SOOOO dry and I want something more natural to put on my skin besides lotion)Compound

the stuff is for our car (which seems to suddenly need a lot of fixing), my 30 goals, and our new house (which I am not getting super excited about until the final papers are signed).  There is a lot of travel in there too, as well as other random stuff (I would love to get dermabrasion on my face to get rid of the little wrinkles and while it is low on the priority list, it is still \"wishable\").  I'll let you know the universe responds to my \"wish list\"! p.s. Just for good measure I am throwing in an \"angel\" picture that a friend gave me that she took when she was on a religious pilgrimage."},

Also due to National Parks Week, these apps will be given away for free too.  Yeah!"},
{"title": "Crossing Off My 30 Goals in 30 Days List", "date": "Thursday, April 19, 2012", "text": "I posted here about the 30 goals I wanted to complete in 30 days.  It really helped that I had a birthday a couple of days ago because two of the more expensive things on the list (a Vegas show and an expensive meal) were given to me as a gift by my wonderful sister in law.  Here's what's been accomplished so far:I did the zipline on Fremont.  Hubby paid for this on my birthday and while we are usually very careful with how we spend our money (it was $15 for a 30 SECOND experience!), it was something I wanted to try and will be a one-time thing.I got free stuff on my birthday.  This turned out so well, that I recommend everyone sign up for these freebie because, well, it's free food and free is a very good price.We ate an expensive meal.  It may not sound expensive to most people but the fact that we (actually my sister in law since it was a gift) paid $26.50 per person for lunch is considered ridiculously expensive by us (our lunches out are usually $1 tacos or splitting a $5 footlong Subway sub).  When I first thought about going to an expensive restaurant I checked restaurants around Las Vegas and found that one restaurant offered a 16 course dinner for $425 per person (!!!).  I couldn't spend that much on one meal if someone handed me the money and insisted I go.  $425 is more than what we pay for groceries for both of us for a month, so there is expensive and there is ridiculous.  Then I did a bit more searching on Yelp and saw that Fogo de Chao got rave reviews so we decided to try it.  I called first and found out that the meal is exactly the same for both lunch and dinner, and then my frugal mind figured that it would be a waste to pay nearly $50 per person when the less expensive lunch option was half the price but exactly the same.  Needless to say, it was wonderful :)Today we will watch a Vegas show (of course buying our tickets at the half price outlet TixForTonite) and tomorrow we plan to go to Hoover Dam (early in the morning as the temps are supposed to be nearly 100 by tomorrow afternoon :I  )."},
{"title": "Today Was My Birthday And...", "date": "Tuesday, April 17, 2012", "text": "And...I did the zipline on Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas (this was one of my 30 goals for the month).We ate our way--for free--around Las Vegas (see story below; this was also on my 30 goals list)(Best news) Our realtor called and said that the bank had accepted the offer we made on house #14!!!Overall it was a great birthday! (And there is still more to come for the rest of the week, my SIL is springing for a Vegas Show for us and an expensive dinner which, besides being nice birthday presents, are two more goals on the list!).And now for the free food story...I saw this website that lists a whole bunch of places where you can eat free on your birthday.  So I immediately began signing up for their birthday clubs, BUT I realized that I was signing up within 24 hours of my birthday so I think that my registration didn't fall into the queue to get birthday coupons from any of these companies.  Bummer.Fortunately, at Firehouse Subs, all I had to do was show my license and they gave me a free sub.  Then I used some of the coupons I got from signing up for many of these offers (these weren't birthday coupons just thanks for signing up coupons) and we ate our way through Las Vegas, from breakfast to dinner, for free (or nearly free).  This is what we had:One free Firehouse sub (hubby and I shared it and we were full after that, this was the first time we ate there and it was really good!).Two free chicken soft tacos from Del TacoBuy One, Get One Free Orange JuliusAn IHOP Rootie Tootie Fresh and Frootie Breakfast (hubby and I shared this too; of course we tipped since this was a sit-down restaurant)We still have a handful of coupons for a free a Arby's sandwich, a free Arby's milkshake, and a free piece of pie at Sharies that we were too full to use today.Lesson learned: sign up for these offers way before your birthday so you will get your birthday coupons. Also, if someone is hungry and needs free food I would definitely tell them to start signing up for these because as soon as you do, you will get a bunch of free food coupons in your email and that is a very good way to keep from being hungry."},
{"title": "My Goals For...", "date": "Monday, April 16, 2012", "text": "I think I will skip posting my goals for this week because, well, I really slacked off last week and don't have much planned for this week. But, I did make up a bucket list (see tab at the top of this page) and starting tomorrow, I plan to start working on my 30 day challenge which I posted here (it's my birthday tomorrow so while it would seem odd to start a challenge in the middle of the month, starting it off on my birthday kind of makes sense, especially since \"get free things on my birthday\" is on the list!).And here's some more things about my bucket list:I got ideas for the list here, here, and here.Many people had this goal on their list so I added it to mine (and will post my answers here when I do it).Many people had this goal on their list and while it is interesting, especially if you are a writer, I didn't add it to my list but will definitely keep the link for future reference.This link was also mentioned a few times and it is just nice so I thought I would share it with you.I will post my activities for both my 30 day challenge and my bucket list either here or with a link to my other blog if I post it there (mostly travel/general interest stuff goes on my other blog while money related stuff and personal stuff goes in this blog).What's on your bucket list?"},
{"title": "Today I Am Thankful For...", "date": "Sunday, April 15, 2012", "text": "My weekly gratitude list...Rain in the desert.  It rained last night and I was so excited I ran outside.  I'm from Seattle and I know rain and while I don't get excited about the three-months-with-no-break kind of rain we get there, in the desert it is very much welcome.Great writers.  While Julia Quinn, et al. may not win a Pulitzer or anything like that, today's crop of romance writers have certainly set the bar high for witty and clever writing in the romance genre; I am positively devouring her books at the moment.An awesome hubby.  I am always thankful for him.  Tonight he is in the kitchen whipping up a gourmet dinner as he often does (he is an amazing cook) and he spoils me something terrible. The great library system in Las Vegas.  I am often thankful for the library as it is full of great free stuff (wi fi, movies, books, etc) but today I learned that you can check out ebooks online from them as well. Wow!My health.  I often take my health for granted, or rather, don't give it much thought at all unless I have a medical problem, but today as we were walking down the Las Vegas Strip it suddenly hit me that I am thankful to be able to even do such a thing.Ideas.  I tend to write all the time--books, articles, blog posts, etc--and while I have no idea where all of the ideas come from, I am certainly glad they are there.  Case in point, a few days ago I had an idea for a new book and within three days I had typed out 15,000 words and it really shocked me.  I actually said out loud \"where did all of that come from???\"So much knowledge online.  You can do online school, you can learn a massive amount of stuff from Khan Academy, you can use LiveMocha to learn a language from someone in another country....so much amazing knowledge at the touch of a mouse these days.Chocolate chip cookies.  I whipped up a batch yesterday and besides being chocolaty and satisfying, they brought back memories of my grandmother who taught me to bake.Having hope that we will get a new house here in Las Vegas.  I am very hopeful that our last offer (#14) will be approved.The fact that I am not having a last minute panic attack over my taxes like others may be doing today.  For the first time in more than ten years we actually got money back so of course I filed our taxes as soon as I could this year instead of putting them off until, um, today, April 15th.What are you thankful for this week?p.s. The photo is of Sol Duc Falls in Washington state for lack of any other picture to put here (I've determined the blog looks much better with pictures than without)."},
{"title": "I Think I Am Unemployable  :I", "date": "Saturday, April 14, 2012", "text": "I want to make some quick cash and writing doesn't exactly do that for me.  In fact, when I sell an article it could take over a month to get paid.  I am also writing a couple of books but it looks like it could take a long time (if ever!) to profit from these.  A friend of mine has been very kind to pitch some work my way but these are one-time things and they are now at a stand-still until their merger goes through so I am waiting...and waiting.  I do make a bit of money from AdSense (a very little bit) and I continue to write articles but even these I should probably work harder on so I will have more articles in print during any given month...So what did I do?  I ran to CraigsList.Oh. My. God.  While I realize CraigsList is an excellent tool for many things (I've used it to sell big items like furniture and had excellent results BTW) and others have used it to find housing, etc, however, when I looked at their job postings the experience left me rather glum.  And then I realized this was the same problem I had when I was in high school and we were told to look through a big book of careers and decide what we wanted to be so the career counselor could put us on the right educational track.  The problem was that none of the jobs--neither from the big book in high school or the giant list of jobs on CriagsList--seemed the least bit interesting to me.Obviously I have the luxury of being picky, since I don't have to work, but some extra cash right about now would be nice (I've suddenly got the hankering for a new car along with my many travel plans and since we live cash-only that means I need, um, cash--and lots of it--for all of these wants).  And while I have a ton of experience, mostly from being self employed, none of the work I have done actually fits in to a nice job description (the work I do actually ranges across about 20 job descriptions so I am proficient in all but expert in none).Since I live in Las Vegas there are a lot of service industry jobs here but none sound like a good fit for me either: security (I'm faceblind so that wouldn't work well), waitressing (have you seen the skimpy outfits they wear?  While I'm no prude I know that no one wants to see my 45 year old body in any of those uniforms), bartending (I've never drank and I don't like drunk people.  I did bartend during college but aside from keeping the bar neat and orderly I was probably not the best bartender), hotel housekeeping (ick.  I can barely stand to clean my own bathroom, have you seen how tourists leave their rooms???), casino dealer (hubby did this for a while after he retired and really enjoyed it but then again he really enjoys people, me, not so much, especially if they are smoking like a chimney and whining about losing their money--I would have to logically point out that no one is reaching into their pocket and taking their money, they are making the decision to throw it out the window...and then I would probably launch into a discussion on statistics and then I would probably get fired).  You see the problem...The only jobs that looked vaguely interesting were laundry sorter (I have Aspergers so repetitive things are rather calming for me), and sign spinner (you know, those people who dance on street corners with signs but I am a red head and this is Las Vegas so I think this would give me a severe case of sun burn...but I could definitely dance on a street corner).So I think I will take some time this weekend to devise some sort of self employment work that I can do here.  Unfortunately I have no contacts here (which made finding lucrative work in Seattle so simple when I lived there--everyone in the industries I worked in knew who I was so work came to me instead of me hunting down work) but there must be something I can do.  I'll let you know what I come up with..."},

Ugh.I have hardly got any of my goals for the week completed :(Hubby said that as soon as we get a new house he will go paleo with me for a month.  He has amazing willpower so I am hoping that we get a house soon.I have three books in various stages of development (I had a new book idea a couple of days ago and have since laid down 15,000 words on it. Holy. Cow.)I just checked and my AdSense revenue seems to be growing a bit over past months. Yipee!I have made no money this month towards my goal of a trip to the UK in the fall.  I don't even know why I make goals because I usual FAIL at them.  Double ugh.And here's a picture from my collection because I haven't been anywhere to take pictures lately but my blog looks kind of bereft without them.p.s.

It's half done and it should cost about $200 for the TV and mailing costs.  This should be do-able.I want to walk for at least an hour every day. I can easily fit this into my schedule if I am not so lazy!I want to order my mother's birth and death certificates (this would be $40 instead of $160 for mom, grandma, and grandpa all at the same time.  Maybe ordering these for one person a week would be more realistic).I should get a check this week which will pay off the money I took from our emergency fund for the computer, next I will have to replace the money I took from the fund for the dentist.I want to write another article for Freelance Switch this week (I'm not sure if I am \"official\"with them or not but instead of submitting articles to them through their website like I have been doing, they gave me a password to their Wordpress account and told me to mark it 'for review'...hmmm).That's all, this looks much more realistic.  And I love the roses that are blooming right outside of where we live (hubby likes them because the complex takes care of them instead of him having to be the gardener!)."},
{"title": "Happy Easter!  My Gratitude List!  A Liebster Award!", "date": "Sunday, April 8, 2012", "text": "First of all, Happy Easter!  I miss not having kids and grandkids around because then we don't get to do fun things like dying Easter eggs and having an egg hunt.  But, unlike the town we used to live in where literally every business shuts down for Easter, we are in Las Vegas and I am guessing that EVERYTHING is open today because, well, it's Las Vegas. Oh, here's a picture that kind of corresponds to Easter--it's a rabbit that a girl was carrying in her gym bag on the bus a while back.  He doesn't much look like an Easter bunny but...close enough :)Today I am thankful for...Spring food.  There is something about eating fresh strawberries and asparagus that fairly shouts \"spring is here!\"Having work dropped in my lap.  I know I need to get out there and find some work but I have been a bit lazy lately and a friend has been giving me a bunch of work lately so I am very happy about that.Feral Homemaking gave me a Liebster Blog Award! (see story below)Having health insurance.  Hubby had to get his prescriptions renewed with his new doctor and not only does our new insurance cover the doctor completely, but all of his prescriptions were free as well!Having an emergency fund.  Unfortunately we don't have dental insurance so our emergency fund came in handy this past week when I needed to get a crown done.Having soooo many options for shopping.  Some places (like where my friends live in Forks, WA) have a pretty limited number of places to shop and while I am not shopping nearly as much as I used to, the array of places to shop in Las Vegas is just huge...thousands and thousands of stores selling nearly everything you could ever want.The hubby.  I am always grateful that I have a wonderful hubby.Educational TV--I love PBS!A very patient realtor...we are currently on offer #13.The library.  Now that the hubby has realized that he can have a nearly endless supply of free movies from the library, he has been watching about four each night!And finally, I was surprised to get a message from Pamela saying that she had given me a Liebster Blog Award.  I've never won a blog award, or any other award for that matter, before so I was really surprised (in fact, I'm usually just surprised that people even read my blog at all!).Here's the rules:\"The Liebster Blog Award is a great way to get traffic to blogs you like but that aren't widely known.  The rules are simple:Thank the person who nominated you and link back to them.List your top five picks (who have less than 200 followers) and link to them, telling a bit about each one.  Leave a comment on their blogs to let them know you've nominated them.Copy and paste the award on your blog.Have faith that your followers will do the same to other bloggers.Have fun!\"And here's my five blog picks who I am awarding a Liebster to:Clamco.  This nice lady was one of the first people to comment on my blog which was really encouraging.  I find her blog fascinating because I don't know much about collectibles and she provides a bunch of information (and great pix!) about how to buy and sell collectibles on her wonderful blog.My 1/2 Dozen Daily.  This nice lady (there are a lot of nice ladies in the blog world!) has a wonderful blog with lots of amazing pictures (she can sew AND take great pictures as well!) and I admire how she can take care of a big family and have a growing custom sewing business too (check out her creations in the 'custom order' page of her blog).Out My Window.  This nice lady (I see a pattern here) has a great blog and she is SO busy--she takes care of her family, has a dance studio, puts on dance shows, sews costumes...wow makes me tired even reading her blog but it is a fun read so check it out!Shaking the Money Tree.  Another nice lady blogger who has a fascinating life.  I admire how she is pulling herself out of debt (check out her debt pay down updates--amazing!).Head Over Heels in Debt.  Another lady blogger (I rest my case) who is working hard to get out of debt. So far she has paid down nearly $40,000(!!!) in debt. Wow!It's great being part of such a wonderful blogging community.  When everyone is focused on getting out of debt, ans sharing their ideas and experiences, we all win!"},
{"title": "The Benefits of Going Small", "date": "Saturday, April 7, 2012", "text": "This past week the hubby and I were looking around for appliances.  The last place that we made an offer on will need a refrigerator, washer, and dryer so we were looking in anticipation of the bank accepting our bid (notice I am not holding my breath as this is offer #13 so far!).While we were debating the pros and cons of refrigerators, it dawned on me that a smaller (and thus cheaper) refrigerator would be just what we need.  Besides the lower price, a smaller refrigerator will make us buy less food and with only two of us, a big fridge full of food means that a lot of the food would probably go to waste before we can eat it.  Then it dawned on me that this theory will work for a lot of things in our lives...A smaller closet will encourage you to buy fewer clothes and to wear the clothes that you have.A smaller home will mean you can't buy a lot of stuff to fill it up because you don't have the space.A one car garage instead of a two car garage will cut the \"garage creep\"--whether it be tools, gadgets, or storage of junk--in half.A smaller car means less weight to carry and thus less gas used.A smaller bedroom means the kids won't need as much stuff to make it look \"full\" (and thus there will be less stuff to buy, clean up, maintain, scatter across the floor, etc).A smaller office will mean less furniture to make it look well furnished.You get the picture.  This is also one of the reasons we wanted to downsize with the next home we buy.  Since we sold our much bigger house over a year ago, then watched as droves of CraigsListers and garage salers hauled away nearly everything we had in our house (at about 10 cents on the dollar compared to what we paid for the stuff) my thought was 'never again'.  Never again am I going to have a huge house that needs to filled up with stuff.  Never again am I going to buy buy buy stuff I don't need need need. Never again am I going to let \"bigger is better\" be my motto.  I have now learned that smaller is better (and it's also cheaper) so our next refrigerator will be a basic model just big enough for our food but not too big.  And I will be happy with that."},

Yippee!We are still waiting to hear if offer on house #13 has been approved, so no word on that yet.I haven't got any responses to my Fiver ads yet (you can see them here and here).  But then I checked and it looks like many people are willing to do what I posted for $5.  Maybe I need to do something more unique.I got a temporary crown on my tooth yesterday and will get the permanent one in a few weeks.  Because we paid cash for it they took $100 off and I ended up paying $650 for it.Hubby is an excellent cook.  Tonight he made barbecue beef ribs, baked beans, mashed potatoes, and vegies. Yum.  (Note the total for this meal was around $5 and we have plenty of leftovers.  It really does pay to cook from scratch).I love my new not-so-smart phone.  Here's why (sometimes I upload photos to Blogger and they end up turned sideways for some unknown reason...).And finally, we have very few flowers here in Vegas but I found these pretty roses (see photo above) that someone has kept watered near where we live.  I love roses.I hope you have a wonderful Easter weekend!"},
{"title": "Do You Eat Breakfast?", "date": "Thursday, April 5, 2012", "text": "I am a big fan of breakfast.  I didn't used to be.  In fact, all through my school years and on through college I never ate breakfast, mostly because I don't feel like eating so early in the morning and because I was so busy.  But now that I have a very relaxed schedule and am not getting up at o'dark 30 in the morning, I have found that I must have breakfast every day.  Here's my favorite breakfasts, most which cost less than $1 per meal.Oatmeal. I throw some raisins or chopped apple in with the oats while they are boiling away and it comes out really yummy.  I eat this topped with milk and cinnamon.Granola.  I make my own and it is super simple (take a big bowl of oats, and some mashed nuts and some brown sugar, stir with a small amount of oil and maple syrup then bake at 250 degrees until it is dry).  To the baked granola add raisins or dried cranberries and milk.  Also yummy.Eggs and toast (super simple)...I like my eggs scrambled.A fried egg sandwich.An egg salad sandwich.Peanut butter and jelly on toast.Deviled eggs and toast.Scrambled eggs on a flour tortilla with jam (take a warm tortilla, add a small slather of strawberry jam then add scrambled eggs, wrap and eat).Leftovers--everything from pizza or casserole to fried chicken or fish and rice.Eggs and pancakes or waffles or french toast (pancakes and waffles can be made ahead of time and frozen or kept in the refrigerator then heated up for breakfast.That's what I eat for breakfast.  I always eat some kind of fruit with my breakfast (whatever is on sale or in season, right now mostly apples, strawberries, and bananas).  Also, I don't eat pork so that kind of rules out the most common types of breakfast meat (ham, bacon, sausage).  I try not to eat wheat much so my range of toast and bread products usually include sprouted wheat breads and wheatless breads).Eating breakfast really does get your day off to a great start.  You don't feel so lethargic, you have more energy in the morning, and your aren't as likely to be starving and gorge yourself at lunch."},

I have no idea.  (Note this is one of the reasons I don't link this blog from my regular website...I think the family wouldn't like it that I am talking about them).My monthly challenge for April got off to a bad start.  First I couldn't find my redditors at the reddit meet up (what I was going to do for day one) then yesterday I was busy all day taking our guests around.  Now a nephew called and said he and his friends will be here in mid April for a week so I have decided to do my month-long challenge next month because my schedule is so out of whack this month :IWe have made our \"highest and best\" offer on home #13.  This place is actually a condo and while I said before that I didn't want a condo, we found one that we liked so we made an offer.  Since the price on these units has gone up $20,000 since last summer and it's still rising, we figure that if we really don't like living in a condo we can always sell it then find a house.  Hubby is just eager to have a place of our own instead of renting.This month I need to focus on MAKING MONEY.  I have ten goals for just this week that will require a lot of money and more goals than that for the month so I need to step up my earnings ASAP!It's getting warmer and warmer here in Las Vegas and we just realized that the AC in the car is blowing warm air.  We didn't drive the car for nearly a year when we were traveling plus in Washington we seldom used air conditioning so who knows how long it has been like this but we definitely need to get it fixed (yet another expense).  Like I said in a previous post, Murphy has definitely set up shop with us.  :IWe went to the premium Outlet mall yesterday and I didn't buy a thing.  I have changed my attitude/life so much over the past few years that it has left me positively shopping impaired :IThat's all for now...I hope you are having a wonderful day!"},

Yeah!I am grateful that I was able to figure out WordPress and didn't have to call my web hosting company and have them un-mess-up the server side of my website after I got done experimenting with it.  I can't believe it worked!What are you grateful for this week?"},

That's a lot of dreams.Then I asked myself what I would do if I actually WON the lottery and I quickly concluded that I really would not want to win it.  I mean really really not want it.  Which sounds weird because everyone wants more money but I am so happy with my life right now that I think that winning that much money would would make my life much more complicated and perhaps even unhappy.  Now if a friend won it and wanted to send me $100,000 that would be nice.  A little extra money is always nice because it is like a treat, but hundreds of millions of dollars seems more like a large anchor around your neck with you teetering on the edge of a bridge.  Definitely not a happy place to be.So I will cheer on other people who buy lottery tickets (well maybe not cheer exactly as lottery tickets are really just a tax on the desperate and those who can't do math) and be happy that I am quite content with my life as it is.On an odd note, did you know that you can't even buy these lottery tickets in Nevada?

{"title": "Mired in WordPress Today", "date": "Thursday, March 29, 2012", "text": "I finally made the leap!  I have used a variety of software to create my websites (FrontPage first, then when that was discontinued I went to Dreamweaver which was very complicated, then finally settled on Expression Web) and a variety of platforms for my blogs (Tumblr and then settled on Blogger).  I know that everyone and their brother has switched both their website and blogging to the WordPress platform but when I tried to use it a few years ago, it just seemed complicated and I didn't have time for the learning curve so I went back to the tried and true methods I had been using. Fast forward to today (actually this month).  The software I use for websites has been kind of buggy, even with a new computer, and Blogger is making changes as well (nothing significant but still) so it got me to thinking that since I have my own web host for my websites (all except for this blog) I figured I might as well check into WordPress since it is free (as opposed to hundreds of dollars for most web design software).  I love free!I figured I would experiment first on my website (better than with my client's websites of course), then I checked out a book from the library on the subject (WordPress for Dummies if you must know) and read through it, then this morning I checked out my webhost and found that I didn't actually have to do anything to set up WordPress, just push a button.  So far, so good!  Then I found a theme.  Then I spent the last four hours altering it to my liking (with a lot of help from the book and Google).  This is the result so far.  Also, if you are following my other blog, I moved it from Blogger to my website which you can find here.  This Cash Only blog won't be going anywhere for a while.  After a bit more of learning about WordPress I will switch over my other eight websites...which should take a good long while to do.Money lessons:If you can get good software for free...that's awesome!You can learn any new program/software for free simply by checking out a book or going online!Once you learn a new skill (in this case WordPress) you can sell that skill to others and make money!"},
{"title": "My BIG April Challenge", "date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2012", "text": "My birthday is coming up in April, and since I will be hitting the big 45, and since I also found this guy's blog  who did a bunch of cool monthly challenges which inspired me, I thought I would do some sort of daily challenge for the month.  I've decided to do one thing a day for the month of April that will challenge or inspire me.  My list looks like this:Do a LV Reddit meet up.Do a LV Jelly meet up.Walk the Las Vegas Strip.Go on a Volksmarch.Wear a \"free hugs\" sign and stand on the LV Strip for an hour.Do the zipline of Freemont.Do a ride at the top of the Stratosphere (terrifying).Go to a LV show.Eat an expensive meal.Play poker.Write a book in a day.Apply to UNLV.Go to the Grand Canyon.Climb the west mountain.Do a random act of kindness.Interview a stranger.Spend 24 hours in Las Vegas and blog about it.Go to the Bodies Exhibit.Crash a convention.Hike Red Rock Canyon.Get free things on my birthday.Attend a university lecture.Attend a concealed carry class.Photograph cemeteries around LV.Go to San Francisco for lunch.Do a physical event (like a charity run).Go to Springs Preserve.Sing karaoke at a club.Go to the First Friday art gathering.Photograph the Hoover Dam.And aside from the daily challenge, my BIG BIG BIG goal is to fund our BIG BIG BIG vacation this fall so my goal for this month, as far as our vacation is concerned, is to pay for the UK portion (buy flights to Connecticut, from NYC to the UK, and pay for the cruise from the UK to Florida) plus earn $2000 for our travel fund.  Holy crap I am going to be BUSY!"},
{"title": "I Was Soooo Tempted!", "date": "Tuesday, March 27, 2012", "text": "Thanks to a payment from Adsense that hit my bank account yesterday, I was able to go online to Amazon and order the cell phone I have been wanting for a while.  While the phone was not super expensive at only $79.99, I of course first Googled Amazon promotions and coupons to see if there were any other ways I could save money on this purchase (I tend to Google coupons for everything).  Unfortunately there weren't any but when I went to the check out page at Amazon a huge offer flashed above my purchase price.  Seems that if I applied for an Amazon Visa or Mastercard, I would get an additional $50(!!) off my purchase.  I was super tempted, and considered applying, and thought about what I could do with the extra $50 that I would save...but in the end I decided not to apply.  I have been doing great with no credit cards for more than two years.  Then I heard Dave Ramsey's anti credit card rant in my head.  Then I considered what would happen if I did get the credit card and later gave in to temptation to make other purchases with it.  Then I considered what I would do if I ended up with a sky high balance on it like I did with my credit cards in the past.  Then I decided that there was NO WAY I ever wanted even the possibility of having credit card debt again.  Then I paid the $79.99 for my purchase and logged out. Whew! Dodged. A. Bullet."},

(Done)I need to order birth and death certificates for my mom, grandmother, and grandfather (my genealogy is getting off to a slow start because all of these certificates cost money!)I need to get a \"balikbayan box\" put together for my step son in the Philippines.  This is a big box we send every few months with clothes, food, and other stuff which costs a grand total of $75 to ship which is cheap but this time he needs a TV sent because his TV was electrocuted in a lightening storm..yikes that's about $125 by itself!"},
{"title": "10 Things I Am Grateful For", "date": "Sunday, March 25, 2012", "text": "I was reading Carla's blog today and loved her post about being grateful.  Since it is Sunday, I just may make it a habit to count my blessings at least once a week here.  Here's what I am grateful for today:I am grateful for my health.  Finally I am getting over my cold and everything else about my health is pretty good as well.I am grateful for my awesome hubby!I am grateful for computers and the internet.  Thirty years ago the lifestyle I am living now would have been impossible.  With computers and the internet, nearly anything is possible these days!I am grateful that I found a Timbuk2 bag (see photo) for my new computer and it was only $12.95 at Ross!!!  Usually this brand of bag ranges from $40 on up!I am grateful that I have more than enough food.  I was reading this article today and it was soooo sad and we often don't think about people who literally starve to death because we have so much amazing food everywhere we look here in the US.I am grateful that I am free to do basically anything I want.  Sleep all day?  No problem.  Hang out with friends? Of course.  Travel anywhere it the world on a moments notice? That too.  Freedom is a really nice thing.I am grateful for time.  At this point in my life I have a lot of time, again, to do with as I want.  Most people are pressed for time, many have no extra time in their day at all and I, well, I am enjoying the fact that I just happen to have a lot of time these days.I am grateful for the beautiful weather.  It has been around 80 degrees every day this week.  For March that is unheard of where I come from so I am loving every ray of sunshine.I am grateful that there is an amazing library system nearby.  I finally dragged hubby to the library and told him to get some movies.  He was surprised and said I never told him that the library had new movies.  So he has been watching about four free movies a day for the past week.I am grateful for well made products.  My new computer, my Timbuk2 bag, my camera...when a product is made well and works well I am a a happy camper.  What are you grateful for today?"},
{"title": "101 Weird and Crazy Ways to Bulk Up Your Emergency Fund", "date": "Friday, March 23, 2012", "text": "I was reading this post over at Barb's blog and she made an excellent point.  It really is hard to bulk up your emergency fund when you are on a fixed income.  Actually whether you have a fixed income or a low income, your income is usually budgeted down to the last penny before you even get your check so trying to squeeze anything else out of it is nearly impossible.  Of all of the changes we have undergone since we changed our entire lifestyle, I miss having big checks coming in regularly the most.  It's nice to know that there is more money on the horizon (I especially miss the big bonuses I used to get...now I have to work for every little penny!) so I wracked my brain and came up with these weird and crazy ideas to make some extra money for your emergency fund:Sell blood and plasma.Sell your hair (wig makers pay big bucks for long hair I have been told).Sell semen (obviously you have to have the moral proclivity, and the requisite body parts, to do so).Sell your eggs (young, educated women can make about $8000 a pop selling their eggs to fertility clinics but I heard it is a pretty long and involved process).Participate in medical experiments (there are usually opportunities to do this in large cities where medical trials are being held).Rent out the attic, the basement, or a spare room in your house.Move to the attic or basement of your house and rent out the main part of your house.Rent out your garage to someone who needs a cheap place to store things.Rent our parking spaces (this is especially lucrative if you live in a city where parking is limited or if you live near where big events are staged--such as a fair--where people would pay you to park in your yard).Walk dogs (I was surprised there is such a big market for this).Pet sit (I was shocked when some co workers in the past told me how much they paid for their daily pet sitters!)People sit (consider babysitting or being a care provider for the elderly).Hire out your muscles and your truck (my friend advertises on CraigsList and people have hired him to haul all kinds of things).Hire out your skills (the same friend makes extra cash doing odd jobs such as plumbing, simple car repairs, yard clean up, etc).Put your graphics skills to work: make logos for small businesses, design window displays or paint windows for businesses based on the season, design marketing materials for small businesses, etc.Stand on a busy corner with a sign asking for cash (obviously many people won't be comfortable doing this--either morally or ethically--but a guy the hubby used to play poker with would be on a certain street corner each weekday morning at rush hour and collect up enough funds to play poker in the afternoon).Go trashpicking, clean up the items you find, and resell them on CraigsList or at your garage sale (this 14 year old did just that...then bought a house!).Have a garage sale.Sell better items on CraigsList.Become an eBay goddess like my friend Lorraine (there is an art and a science to being a successful eBayer but many people create good side businesses this way).Make your blog/website create an income stream for you (either like this talented lady does with her interesting blog posts and sewing business or like this family does with a combination of book sales and advertisements on their website).Go to garage sales then resell the items at your own garage sale or on CraigsList (back when we were having a garage sale each week to empty out our house, there were a whole group of regulars who came early each morning of the sale. Turns out they went to every sale they could in order to find things to resell).Sell stuff online.  Besides CraigsList, you can sell stuff online at etsy (hand crafts), Freelance Switch (freelance articles), and Amazon (either books you own or books your write like this girl did).Sell weird things online (this girl made money selling her underwear online--eeuuwww, my friend's son made money selling online gaming characters online that he created out of thin air--wow, and one lady sold tumbleweeds on CraigsList--who knew they are so in demand?!)Try a temp job.  Sometimes CraigsList \"gigs\" has some interesting one-time jobs.  Temp agencies can be interesting too.  Also you can position yourself to work only on certain busy days (ie: deliver flowers for the local flower shop on Mother's Day, work at the polls on voting day, etc).Get a kickback...er, referral fee.  Sometimes business owners will give you a \"kickback\" if you bring them customers (my old car dealer would give a customer $100 for referring another customer to him who bought a car, nightclubs in Las Vegas give kickbacks to taxi drivers who steer clients to their clubs, etc).Sell your old gold (I made a bunch of money doing this before we moved; I sold broken chains and other gold jewelry that I no longer wanted).Find a marketing research company and give them your opinion (I used to be cornered by these people at the mall all the time.  For a bit of my time I usually was given $7 but other companies pay considerably more).Check and see if you have missing money.Enter contests (some people do this as a nearly full time job, entering small online contests, others audition for American Idol or Amazing Race in the hopes of winning a million dollars).Make money online (you can do everything from taking surveys to being part of an e jury).Get a part time job or a full time, short-term job (I've known people who worked on a cruise ship or worked fishing in Alaska in order to make a lot of cash in a short period of time--usually room and board are provided for free with these types of jobs so you can bank your whole pay check during the term of the work).Look around your area and figure out what would sell well (ie: people sell firewood on the road to  a campground near our old home, one kid used to sell worms by a lake where the fishermen would congregate, and, when the whales came into Puget Sound and drew tourists, some enterprising guys ran to the screen printing shop and had t shirts made up quickly in order to sell them to the tourists).Make money from your hobby--write an article, teach a class, sell products related to your hobby, sell the items you make doing your hobby.Go to a u-pick farm or out in the woods and glean items to sell (berries, nuts, fruit, etc).Buy food in bulk, break up the containers, and sell the times with a small profit for yourself (ie: buy a 100 pound bag of potatoes or onions, divide them up by the pound, and sell them at a street-side stand).Do something morally questionable (this could range from stripping to selling your homemade pornos online.  Not that I agree with such a thing because I don't think I could ever do anything like that but many people do and make a lot of money).Be a tutor (if you are good at math, science, history, etc).Invent something (the lady that invented Spanx is worth more than a billion dollars now!). Run errands for people in your neighborhood.Choose a hobby that pays (one friend likes to golf and would collect up all of the stray golf balls he could find them sell them, another friend ended up \"adopting\" her kid's 4H chickens--and made money from selling their eggs, my granddad used to find all kind of cool--and valuable--things with his metal detector).Create a small business based on a need in your area (you could be a party planner, a scrapbook maker, a family photographer, etc).Drive cars (some people will pay you to move their car from one location to another--usually quite a distance away; also years ago, a local car dealership would pay me to drive cars either to other dealerships or to their customers).House sit (you can either do this by living at the house in question or just stopping by daily or weekly to make sure all is well).If you have some land, grow a garden then either sell the produce at a roadside stand or open your garden up for u-pickers (my grandparents did this for years with strawberries, raspberries, and grapes).Recycle (aluminum cans, metals, newspapers...whatever your local recycling company will pay for).Try busking (this is especially popular in Las Vegas and other tourist areas where street performers hustle for cash).Bring food to sell (I used to do this in college--I would buy pizza in bulk for a low price then cart it over to the university on weekend nights and walk through the dorms selling the pizza for a profit. This also works when selling baked goods at offices and lunch items near construction sites).Become a walking advertisement or do this with your car (people have made money by plastering their car--or themselves--with paid advertising).Sell your used stuff through a consignment store (this works well with high end clothes and purses as well as with gently used baby things).Give lessons (this can be anything from piano and violin to driving and language lessons).Do stuff that other people find repulsive (ie: cleaning up the back yard for people who have dogs, specializing in cleaning bathrooms, cleaning up repo homes that have been trashed, cleaning up crime scenes, etc).Drive people around (you may specialize in driving tourists around your city, driving the elderly to their appointments, or driving kids to after school activities).Offer a mobile grooming service (ie: pet washing and grooming, mobile haircuts if you are licensed to do so, mobile car washing, etc).Home services are big business in Las Vegas.  People do everything on a daily work/daily pay basis from home or office cleaning to landscaping, to painting, to carpet installation to fence building, etc.Deliver newspapers (my sister did this for years as a second job, she could bring her baby along with her and complete the work before her regular job each morning).Sign up to work for annual/seasonal events--you can deliver phone books, be a census worker, be a dealer at a World Poker Tour event...fortunately in Las Vegas there are so many annual events that you can work in the tech industry one week (CES) then the rodeo industry another week (National Finals Rodeo).Take a short-term training course then get a side job (ie: lifeguard, EMT, medical assistant, phlebotomist, etc).Charge people to help them fill out forms (I have done this by helping people fill out job applications, scholarship applications, immigration forms, apartment rental applications, doing their taxes, etc.  Note that being bi-lingual can really help bring in clients for this).If you are a naturally organized person, help others to organize their home, office, or processes...for a fee of course.Be a sales associate (my mom used to sell Avon, Tupperware, candles, and all other sorts of \"home party\" items).Beautify people (do haircuts, manicures and pedicures, massage, facials, make up for special occasions, hair styling/coloring/braiding, personal shopping, etc. Note that some of these things require licenses).Sew.  If you are good at sewing your can do everything from tailoring and dressmaking to specializing in unique sewing projects (my friend is known for sewing covers for barbecues, hot tubs, and awnings. She is now moving into specialized sewing for RV items).Be a guide.  You can show people around your city or take people to the best hunting and fishing locations in your area.Put your tech talents to work. People will pay for all kinds of tech services, from setting up new computers and installing software to putting together a wi fi network, creating websites, setting up social media accounts, installing Wordpress blogs, etc.Teach something unusual (among the unusual classes I have heard of: dumpster diving, how to process an entire animal carcass for your freezer, sex classes, how to forage for mushrooms, etc).Teach specialized classes (I have a friend who is a nurse who specializes in teaching continuing ed classes for paramedics; another friend is a renowned cardiac surgeon who makes money on the side by teaching at the local university, giving presentations at conferences, and working as a consultant to the military).Expand on your regular job (this guy, for example, started out as a doctor who liked the outdoors, he ended up creating a multi-faceted business based on his passions).Put together a side business that you can run via the local farmer's market or fairs (I have friends that started selling crafts at a small farmer's market and now do this at ALL of the fairs in the state.  Ditto for a guy who makes candy).Cook for people (you can be a personal chef for a busy family or, as a friend of mine does, she specializes in making desserts from her home country--the Philippines--and people buy her yummy creations in bulk for parties and holidays).Be a coach (you can coach the local baseball or volleyball team or use your skills and motivational spirit to be a life coach or job coach).Work from home using your phone (phone sex operator, telemarketer, triage nurse, etc).If you are a certified educator, consider teaching courses online through an online high school or university.If you have the knowledge and skill--and that's a big IF--consider online trading or other forms of gambling with a fairly high rate of return (such as poker). Get paid for your opinion--this can range from being a mystery shopper to being a paid reviewer (restaurants, software, books, etc).Consider the real estate business.  This could be anything from actually selling real estate to cleaning up repossessed homes for the banks that own them to buying and flipping homes.Check out the possibility of an import or export business.  If you can get products at a super low price from a foreign country (plus learn your way around import regulations), or the opposite, you have products here that would sell well overseas, consider such a side business.Use your detective skills to: find missing pets for a reward, hunt down long lost relatives (genealogy research), reposes cars, be a skip tracer, etc.Gather up your spare change, roll the change, and deposit it into your bank account (it helps if you have a jar or jug that you drop your leftover change into daily; when it comes time to roll the change up you will be pleasantly surprised).Look for products you can develop that relate to popular new items (ie: while you may not have developed the iPad, you can certainly develop apps, covers, and other peripheral items for it).Go commercial with your talents (some people keep up fish tanks for banks and offices, others keep up flowers or gardens for commercial businesses still others do freelance merchandising for products in stores).Find an on-call or substitute position (substitute teacher, substitute bus driver, on-call nurse, on-call server for a catering company, etc).Join an organization that will give you an income, pay off your student loans, or both (ie: National Guard, Teach for America, AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, etc).Turn your home into a Bed and Breakfast.Target the senior market. The senior population is huge these days. Help them out and make some money by teaching at a senior center (activities, exercise, computer classes, etc) or retrofitting their homes (security system, grab bar installation).Ask for work.  Send messages out via email, Twitter, FaceBook, and all of your other social media contacts literally asking for side work.Let the season dictate the work you seek: summer--lawn mowing, fall--fruit and vegetable harvesting, raking leaves, winter--shoveling snow, spring--planting and other farm/yard work.Use your locations to dictate the work you seek: take/sell photos of celebs (Los Angeles), teach skiing (Aspen), take tourists out on your boat (Seattle), scalp tickets for shows and sporting events (New York).Make your own homemade products to sell: jams, jellies, canned salsa, pickles, lotions, soaps, etc.  Some people sell these right at the end of their driveway, others via farmers markets and stores that feature locally-made products.Make memories for people: research their genealogy, put together scrapbooks, record interviews with elderly family members, put together PowerPoint presentations for funerals/weddings/family reunions, etc.Join the day labor pool.  Many cities have areas where day laborers hang out waiting for someone to drive by and ask them to work (around Las Vegas it seems to be in the parking lot of the Home Depot stores; note this is one of the less safe ways to find work).  You can also apply through day labor agencies such as Labor Ready.Solve a crime.  Crime Stoppers and other organizations offer rewards to people who help solve crimes of find people who are wanted by the police.Volunteer.  While this won't immediately put money into your emergency fund, this is a great way to learn skills that can set you up for future employment (ie: volunteering for the local ambulance will set you up to be an EMT in the future; volunteering to write a grant or make a website for a non profit will give you a professional reference and something to put in your portfolio).Look for treasures (this is a huge area including: panning for gold, finding old coins that are still in circulation, going to auctions or estate sales with your knowledge of antique furniture, diving ship wrecks, etc).Lend money.  Obviously this is very high risk (which is why loan sharks charge such high interest rates) but if someone asks for a loan and you absolutely know they will pay you back, you may want to loan money, with a bit extra for you as part of the payback).Look at different marketing schemes, from affiliate marketing to multi-level marketing programs.  While many of these are scammy, some are legitimate and can make you money either by in-person sales or via links on your website.Be an assistant, either online as a virtual assistant or in person as a personal assistant.Re-purpose things (I have a friend that can find a market for anything.  I told him that a local fire department was throwing away some old backboards so he picked them up, made them into silhouettes, and sold them to the local shooting range for target shooting).Barter.  Again this won't put money in your pocket immediately but as this guy shows, you can start with a paper clip (red), barter it, and end up with a house (which you could sell and then put the money in your bank account).Rent out items that you own (think about tools, yard maintenance items, an engine hoist, a chainsaw...basically items that are expensive to purchase that others would want to rent rather than buy).Add value to an item...then sell it (ie: take a baseball to your local MLB game, have a famous baseball player sign it, then sell it!).Whew!  Brain. Wracked."},
{"title": "A Quick Update", "date": "Tuesday, March 20, 2012", "text": "Sorry, busy.  Here's what's been happening lately:We heard yesterday that our offer on house #10 was not accepted since they accepted someone else's offer so today we looked at yet another house and, surprise, it is the best house we have seen so far.  I think this is the universe's way of saying things will work out well in the long run.  So we made an offer (adding $10,000 to the sales price since it seems that banks will list a very low price to get more people to look at the property then they will take their sweet time collecting offers to get the highest sales price).  I am hopeful but not holding my breath for obvious reasons...this is house offer #11.Right when I was racking my brain to figure out how I was going to pay for my new laptop by next month (and how to fund my giant vacation plans) I got an email from my friend.  I mentioned a while back that her agency is merging with another one and I told her to hold out for $90k since her job responsibilities will increase.  She went into the salary negotiation meeting asking for $100k thinking that she would settle for $90k if they pushed back but to her surprise they told her $100k would be fine, end of meeting.  So when she emailed me to relay this happy bit of information she also asked me to do some rush work for her and she would pay me well for it.  This will more than pay off my laptop and it came totally out of the blue.  I LOVE serendipity.  Now if the universe wanted to shower me with $30,000 I would be totally happy...in shock, but happy.I was sick for the last couple of days. Happily hubby recovered, unhappily I was next in line to get it (as usually happens).  That kept us both home so we ended up saving both the gas and money which would have been spent if we had not stayed home these past couple of days.  Fortunately I am feeling better now.I went to the dentist today and got the $40 cleaning, x rays, and exam done.  I was a bit leery because, after all, $40 doesn't even cover their staff time and disposables but I was pleasantly surprised.  The office was new (the dentist and his partners have three offices now, this one was new so that is why they were running the super $40 special to draw in new local patients).  Anyway, the staff was nice and the service was excellent.  I told the dentist I was having some on and off tooth pain and he did a bunch of things to see where the pain was but for some reason my teeth were perfectly fine today.  He said the x rays didn't show anything and that sometimes teeth get pains that come and go so to come back in a few weeks if it was still bothering me (I figured--as a blog  commentator pointed out--that for a $40 complete dental service the dentist would come up with a whole host of things wrong with me but he was totally honest and I was totally pleased!).  FYI--if you are in Las Vegas you can get a complete dental cleaning, exam, and x rays at Floss Dental on South Rainbow.  There is currently no end date to the $40 special and the visit was well worth it--my teeth are so white and happy now!Sorry this is so rushed but I have work to do!"},
{"title": "And Now, An Even Bigger Challenge...", "date": "Sunday, March 18, 2012", "text": "First, in an effort to brighten up my blog a bit, here are some nice spring flowers (from a couple of years ago at my old house, no spring blooming bulbs here in Las Vegas unfortunately).Hubby is feeling better so we got out for a bit today which was a good thing.  And then I sprang my latest plan on him (which threatens to send him back to his sick bed because he knows what happens when I get an idea in my head...yikes!).  So here it is:I really, really want to do a \"grand tour\" type of vacation in the fall.  After some consideration (and copious amounts of time on Orbitz and Travelocity) I think it should go something like this:August 15-31: Connecticut to visit the family and check out the family graveyard in Massachusetts (found out about this doing genealogy on my grandmother's side of the family).September 1-21: Fly from New York to London.  During this time visit England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland (and visit lots of places I found in my genealogy research in each of these countries).September 21: Take a cruise from London to Ft Lauderdale passing by Spain and Portugal (since this is a re positioning cruise it will only cost $600 each!).October 5: Arrive in Ft Lauderdale.  I fly out the next day to Japan; hubby will go and visit his sister in Florida for a couple of weeks.October 6-16: I will visit my friends in Japan.October 16: Hubby and I will meet up in Manila; me coming from Japan, hubby from Miami.October 17: We fly to Davao, a city in the southern part of the Philippines to visit family and friends.November 15: We fly to Manila and visit friends there for a few days.November 20: We fly back to Las Vegas.The grand total for such a trip will be around $30,000 (!!!); about $7500 for the cruise and air tickets and the rest for spending money (hotel, food, plus the money hubby spends on his entire family when we are in the Philippines).  For a couple of flights we can use air miles which will save us money and I was even thinking about doing a house trade while we are in the UK so we would have free lodging there which would also save money (ditto for the time we are in the Philippines).  Obviously $30,000 is a LOT of money, which I realize, but then again, I think anything can be possible if you want it bad enough and are willing to work for it.  Which means I need to earn about $5000 a month for the next six months in order to pull this off because I told hubby that we wouldn't take money for this trip out of our savings (he is always worried about dipping into our savings).Now my challenge is to figure out how to earn about $5000 a month for the next five months (and obviously some sort of residual income after that so my earnings don't come to a screeching halt at the end of August).  Holy cow that's a lot of money!!  I'll let you know what I come up with!"},
{"title": "It's a Quiet Weekend", "date": "Saturday, March 17, 2012", "text": "Happy St Patrick's Day everyone!  While we now live at ground zero for St Patrick's Day celebrations (Las Vegas), we are (unfortunately) spending the weekend at home.  Hubby has been sick for a few days so we have been holed up at home until he feels better.  And some other stuff:I made a few changes to the blog.  I am so graphics-ly challenged it isn't funny.  But I changed the colors, determined that I need to start adding more pictures, and added a couple of pages where I can highlight links and super money-saving tips.While the hubby is sick (poor guy sounds like he is hacking up a lung or something), we have saved money on gas and spending by staying home for a few days so I guess that is kind of a good thing (but I hope hubby recovers quickly, I would much rather be sick than have to watch him be sick!).I am putting together a challenge for myself for the month of April.  It will be something along the lines of doing an activity each day that intimidates and/or scares the heck out of me like doing the scary ride at the top of the Stratosphere, applying to UNLV, or doing a LV Jelly's meet up (I was going to go to a meet up with this group of techies/hackers last week but the thought of lil ole me intruding on people who actually know what they are doing with computers made me feel super intimidated so I didn't go).It's been two weeks and still not a peep about the house we made an offer on.  Either we have the worst realtor in Vegas OR people who sell property in Las Vegas don't read the part at the bottom of the contract where it says that they need to respond to our offer within 72 hours.We are supposed to have a storm here today complete with rain.  After spending my entire life in the Pacific Northwest, I really do miss not having any rain here.I am dreaming about a three month vacation in the fall.  I would like to hit Japan, the Philippines, the UK, and take a cruise.  The cost for the entire trip would be around $30,000 for both of us (!!) so unless something major happens (maybe I will sell my book?), I may have to ratchet back the dream a bit.I hope you all have a great weekend!"},
{"title": "I Need a Dentist", "date": "Thursday, March 15, 2012", "text": "Why is it that when you just start pulling ahead, something else happens to pull you back??  The last few days I have had a really painful tooth that actually doesn't hurt unless I chew on it.  The bummer part is that my dentist (aka my sister in law) is in Connecticut and currently we are in Las Vegas and also currently the price for round trip tickets from here to CT is around $450, each!So I hopped on Yelp looking for reviews of local dentists.  I figured that I would get some x rays and an exam done here and if it is something major we can fly to Connecticut but if the fix would cost less than two round trip tickets to CT I would just get the tooth fixed here.So after checking out the reviews, I chose three dentists that had good reviews and are located near where we live.  I called and asked for prices--the non insurance price since we don't have dental insurance--and found the one of the dentists was having a special for new patients.  It will cost me a whole $40 for a cleaning, exam, and full x rays.  I jumped on the deal and made an appointment for next week.  Yeah!  Now I am just crossing my fingers that it is something simple like a cavity and not something bigger like a root canal.  Getting old sucks...my body is breaking down as I speak.  Blah!"},
{"title": "I am Soooooo Cheap...", "date": "Wednesday, March 14, 2012", "text": "To which I hear the obligatory \"how cheap are you??\"  Here's some recent examples:I went to pay my cell phone bill today.  The guy at the counter next to me was paying his cell phone bill and it was $108!  So I--loud enough to be clearly overheard--told the guy that was helping me that I wanted to pay my monthly pre-paid cell bill for THIRTY DOLLARS...can you believe how cheap that is?  The guy with the expensive bill looked over at me.  Maybe it will at least make him think twice about saving money.When I went to buy my new laptop, I thought I was going to get a 'worst customer of the year' award.  I know the sales guys make around minimum wage with bonuses based on the extras they get customers to buy but when the guy said \"you really should get an extended warranty\" I said \"nope\" before he could even finish his sentence. Then he said \"you can get a discount on antivirus software if you purchase it with your computer\" to which I replied \"I use Avast, it's free and works really well\".  Finally, and looking dejected, he said that they also offer a pre-paid service plan in case something happens to my computer like it gets a virus or something to which the hubby said \"I get viruses sometimes and she can fix those herself.\"  So he slinked away to retrieve my computer and didn't say anything else.  Sorry dude but I prefer my money in my pocket.I was having a craving for Girl Scout cookies--the thin mints that I can eat an entire box of by myself.  I looked up their sales locations online and it looked like I would have to wait until the weekend to buy some then we went to the dollar store and I found some chocolate mint cookies--for $1--and I was overjoyed to find that they taste exactly like thin mint cookies from the Girl Scouts.  That saved me $3.50 per box (I won't say how many boxes I bought!). Finally, we were going to pay our car insurance with monthly payments (instead of a lump sum of $215 which covers six months) since now we have other bills to pay.  So hubby and I discussed it and we settled on paying the full amount out of our spending money for the next two weeks.  That will leave us a grand total of $100 for spending money until the end of the month.  I would much rather scrimp now and get a bill out of the way than pay monthly payments on anything.  So it looks like we will be eating everything in our cupboards instead of buying anything interesting for the next couple of weeks.  I also put off my haircut and color for two weeks, and I have decided to not even go near a Ross store until April lest I be tempted to buy something.Yikes...I am pretty cheap!"},
{"title": "I Need to Earn $670 STAT!", "date": "Tuesday, March 13, 2012", "text": "After going back and forth with my pain-in-the-ass computer, trying to find website development freeware (there were a few that were OK, none great), and debating about the wisdom of buying a new computer (which would allow me to load my old website development software) I went and did it.  I bought a new fancy smancy computer (14\" HP with a 4g processor, 750g hard drive, Intel i5 processor, etc).And after hours and hours of loading software, updating the new computer, etc. it is working like a dream.  The only slight glitch--there are two actually--is that it cost me $670.21(!!).  The second glitch is that I can't load my MS Office Pro software on it because I don't have the product code for it.  To buy that software it would cost around $500 but I got my last copy from a non-profit I used to work for so it only cost around $21.  Fortunately the new computer has starter Word and starter Excel which are the main programs I use.  Now the only thing missing is MS Publisher but I think there are open source software that is similar to Publisher--and free.Which brings me to the $670 that I need to earn by next month.  Since my old computer was limping along (except that it made the websites I uploaded look like someone bombed those particular web pages) it wasn't a crisis crisis so taking the money out of the emergency fund to buy the new computer, which I did, didn't exactly constitute an emergency.  Therefore I told hubby I would replace the $670.21 by the end of April--the only problem is that I don't work.  Soooo I am going to need to do something to get that money back into our emergency fund and I have about six weeks to do it. Yikes!!  Looks like I need to do another money earning challenge next month!"},
{"title": "Computer Crash, Software Malfunction, Panic, and a Free Fix", "date": "Friday, March 9, 2012", "text": "Yesterday my computer started acting weird.  My friend surmised it was from the solar flares but nothing else seemed to be messed up so I put the laptop away last night and hoped it would somehow fix itself overnight.  Then this morning I went to update some of my websites and nearly fainted.  Seems the program that I have been using FOR AGES suddenly wouldn't work.  For someone who needs to keep a half dozen websites regularly updated it was nearly time to panic!I got the software disk for Expression Web (the website building program that I use that runs around $150) and for some reason it wouldn't repair or overwrite the program.  After trying everything to get the software repaired (trying to delete the program first which it wouldn't let me do because there is some sort of error, restarting the computer, downloading the service packs which made it worse, etc), I really started to panic.My next thought was to buy a new computer and hope that the software could be reloaded on a new computer because I think there is a problem with the file path and the registry that is glitching up my current computer.  But after running to Best Buy and pondering the thought of spending around $700 for a new computer, I spent the day trying to figure a work around for the problem.  Expression Web was dead dead so I needed a new web editor.  Cheap would be good, free would be better, and something I could use relatively quickly would be best (usually the learning curve on this type of software is steep).I used my Google Fu and found...that most people seem to use Wordpress these days.  But I don't have time to learn Wordpress.  So I downloaded a half dozen different free and trial programs for other CSS/HTML editors and found that Kompozer was just about what I needed (unfortunately it looks to be on life support as it hasn't been updated in over two years).  Then I did a bit of research and found that parts of Kompozer don't work--like the FTP part that sends the updated files on your computer to the web host's computer.  Then I found FileZilla which is a free FTP client.So I went into my Expression Web files with Kompozer, make a couple of updates, used FileZilla to zap the files to my host, and it worked!!!So if you are like the hubby, sorry for boring you to death--he knows nothing of computers but how to get to his email and FaceBook page but I was so happy that I resolved the problem for free and don't have to buy a new computer and/or new software that I had to rattle on and on a bit like I did above.The moral of the story: when you have a crisis, Google, there may be a free or cheap way to fix your problem instead of the tried and true (and infinitely more expensive) way."},
{"title": "Today Was...Kind of Amusing", "date": "Wednesday, March 7, 2012", "text": "Not overly so but...I got an email from our realtor asking us to submit our \"last and best offer\" on the house we made an offer on a couple of days ago.  This wasn't actually amusing but rather annoying because it seems like the banks that own repos do this often--they don't simply take the best offer they receive for the property but rather encourage buyers to keep outbidding each other.  We offered a couple more thousand dollars and told the realtor that that was our LAST offer.  Home girl don't play that...in the words of my younger self.A door to door salesman stopped by trying to get us to sign up for our local cable TV service this morning.  He noticed that we had our TV on and when the hubby said that we didn't need cable as we already had TV he asked \"how?\" (probably since he didn't see a satellite dish anywhere in sight).  Hubby told him we get free TV over the air with an antenna and he looked stunned. Now that was amusing.Hubby talked to both his sister and his cousin this morning and both conversations got around to \"are you guys getting jobs soon\" and random comments about how we are able to survive on such a small income (both the sister and the cousin are retired military too so they know about how much hubby gets from his pension and they are also both nearing retirement age so they know about how much he gets from Social Security too).  Hubby just said that we are doing fine and that neither of us plans on working which apparently left them both...dumbfounded.  Seems most people--at least those with huge incomes as both of them currently have--think that if a couple is living on around $2000 per month we must be dumpster diving and begging on a street corner for cash in order to survive.  We really aren't and, oddly enough, we seem to be living so much better with a tiny income than we ever did with a large income.  Go figure...  This made me a bit amused.  Our tax refund hit our bank account this morning.  It's the first time there was money coming in from the IRS instead of going out to the IRS in over a decade.  Yippee!I have been religiously working on my novel for two or more hours a day since a week ago.  It is coming along--60k words so far--and I haven't slacked off yet (color me surprised!).  If (when?) it gets published I am giving you all a free copy!Finally, I was perusing Freelance Switch and was surprised to see a recent article I wrote published there.  Usually the editor will drop me an email and tell me they are going to use my article but I didn't get anything about this one.  It amused me that, like the new TV show GCB which didn't (couldn't?) use it's original name Good Christian Bitches, the editor of FW didn't go with my original title \"Cover Your Ass Techniques for Freelancers\".That's all for today.  BTW I have to brag about the 70+ degree weather we are having in Las Vegas which is wonderful (however no one told me that this time of year is the windy season so we have had 50 and 60 mile per hour winds over the past couple of days. Yikes!)."},

Ever.  I need to get it finished!I am absolutely consuming Julia Quinn books.  I have read five so far and am amazed at what a good writer she is (you don't often find exceptional writing in the romance genre).We made offer number nine on a house yesterday and today we got an email from the realtor saying the bank that owns the house wouldn't be able to consider any offers for another few weeks.  This is why we avoid short sales since it takes so long to even get a yes or no on our offer, and now bank repos seem to be the same.  Arrgghhh   So we will resume our search on Monday.Tomorrow we will have dim sum for lunch at Ping Pang Pong, my favorite Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas (and it is free with hubby's comps!).I spend way to much time on Reddit (and its many sub reddits).  I just do.  AyayayHubby was playing poker and the 96 year old guy playing next to him won $32,000!  I wish wish wish hubby would win that much!  Holy cow that would pay for all of our vacations for the year!I'm keeping one eye on the news this weekend.  We have friends and family in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia and I can't believe how many tornadoes have touched down in the past few days.  Scary!We finally got our health insurance switched around yesterday.  We didn't think to check it before we moved and found that while it covered us anywhere, if we were out of our area (Seattle) we could only go to a local emergency room, not a regular doctor.  So we were able to switch it to another carrier and should be all set.I hope you are all having a wonderful weekend!"},

{"title": "25 Ways to Beat the High Cost of Gas", "date": "Tuesday, February 28, 2012", "text": "Quite a while ago I wrote a post on 50 ways to beat the high cost of food.  Here's some ideas to beat the high (and getting higher by the day) cost of fueling your car:Buy an electric or hybrid car (obviously an expensive proposition but if you commute really far each day and gas prices stay high you may come out ahead. Do the math first, of course).Find the cheapest gas prices in town here.Carpool.  I used to do this when I went to a lot of meetings and this saved me a ton of money on gas as well as wear and tear on my car.If you do drive for work, make sure you are getting reimbursed for your mileage (when I used to be reimbursed for my mileage, I would simply check our state rates occasionally to make sure they hadn't changed since last I checked).Live closer to work.  Another high-front-end type of expense but walking to work could save you a lot of money and give you some cheap exercise as well.Group your errands together and do them in a gas-saving fashion (I tend to make a circle to hit all of the places I need to go to when I do my errands to the bank, library, post office, grocery store, etc).Do as many errands from home as possible (I do nearly all of my banking and bill paying online and if I want a particular book from the library I go online to make sure they have it--and I put a hold on it--before I head off to the library).Instead of \"no spend days\" have \"no travel days\".  In other words, don't leave your house unless it is by walking or bicycling a couple of days a week in order to save money.See if you can work four ten hour days instead of five eight-hour days.  This will save you the cost of commuting one day a week.See if you can work from home (even better!).Commute by motorcycle or moped instead of car.  This will save a ton of money (but it is, IMHO, super dangerous so I would only do this as a last resort).Buy gas and store it.  You could realistically buy a few tank fulls of gas at today's prices and store it for future use.  We used to do this with gas for farm equipment years ago. BUT you need to be able to store it safely and use it before it gets too old.You can always play the market and bet on oil futures.  Obviously not a good idea if you don't know what you are doing but some people who \"bet\" on oil prices a while back are now raking in the money.Try bicycling or walking instead of driving.  I have some healthy friends who can bike 20-50 miles a day to and from work without a problem (I am guessing they are super healthy from all of that exercise).Take the bus instead.  This is what I did when gas prices hit $4+ a few years back.  I left my car at home, bought a monthly bus pass, and found I preferred traveling by city bus rather than driving myself.Check your insurance rates.  If you will be ditching your car most of the time to save money on gas, see if you can get a discount on your car insurance.See if your employer has van pool options.  My sister in law does this.  She lives far from where she works in Atlanta and her employer actually offers free van pools to take her to and from work.  The only thing her van pool mates need to do is alternate who drives the van.Drive better.  This article gives some great tips on how to not drive like a maniac (speeding, fast braking, etc) and save money on gas.Buy cheaper gas.  Actually our car has never had the experience of premium gas so it doesn't know what it is missing.  The cheapest gas works just fine in our car.Look at other travel options.  When we are going to travel somewhere we look at ALL of the options (the cost of driving, taking the bus, taking Amtrak, flying, even going by way of cruise ship).Don't make wasteful driving trips when other options will work.  I am always shocked at the number of parents who drive their kids to and from school when walking or the bus would work just as well.  Ditto for my sister's late night McDonalds runs.Don't take more car than you need.  If you have two or three cars on hand, take the cheapest one that will work for your purposes (obviously hauling the soccer team will mean you will have to take the Escalade, but running to the store for groceries can probably be done in the tiniest car you own).Make fewer trips.  If you are going grocery shopping, try going only once a month to make the grand haul on groceries like this.Can you ditch your car altogether?  I would be happy to but hubby would freak out so for now we are a one car family.  Here's a website of people who have gone car free.Can you become a one car family?  At the most I think we had six cars in our driveway at one time.  Fortunately we were eventually able to have one car shared between the hubby and I which works out really well (and saves us the cost of gas plus insuring, cleaning, and maintaining multiple cars).Here's some more great ways to save money on gas."},
{"title": "A Phone Update and More Stuff", "date": "Saturday, February 25, 2012", "text": "Here's a quick update for the weekend...After I wrote my last post about switching back to a not-so-smart phone, I started playing with my new cell phone and found that the internet was deathly slow so this phone went back to Best Buy and I pulled out my old old cell phone and for some reason the internet on that simple phone was much quicker than the new phone so I guess this is the phone I will use for a while.  This saved me $50 (the cost of the new phone) plus, I listed my smart phone for sale on CraigsList and sold it for $150 about a half hour after the as was posted!  This was a $50 loss from the price I originally paid for the phone but I will be able to make this up with the lower-rate calling plan in 2.5 months.Do you ever put off having a haircut just to save money?  We do.  For me it usually includes using bobby pins to keep my hair off my face for a week or two longer than usual so that instead of having twelve haircuts a year I can get by with about eight.  For hubby, who generally wears his hair kind of short and standing up (yes he is in his 60s but he has the same haircut as kids in their 20s with the top gelled straight up), this means that I run the shaver around his neck and ears every week to keep his hair looking tidy until the top grows too long and he is forced to get a haircut.  Just thought I would share this money saving tip...We are spending the weekend at The Rio.  The cousin had another weekend room comp at the hotel and no one to use it so we packed our bags and drove across town and now are enjoying another \"tourist weekend\" in Las Vegas.  I met the most fascinating lady while we were waiting for our husbands to play poker--she and her husband spend six months each year in Las Vegas and the summer at their home in North Dakota.  Instead of buying a house here and all of the expenses that entails, they simply rent a two bedroom \"suite\" in a hotel for six months a year and she said that saves them a lot of money over the cost of maintaining two homes.  Good idea...I read this blog post over at Judy's blog and I have to agree.  The price of gas is going up shockingly fast (yes, I realize that as Americans we are spoiled with relatively low gas prices compared to other countries but I WANT MY CHEAP GAS!).  I don't know what we will do if gas reaches $5 per gallon.  Fortunately we only have one car and the hubby and I always go everywhere together, and fortunately Las Vegas has a relatively small footprint as far as cities are concerned, and fortunately we don't HAVE to leave the house as neither of us works, BUT we currently don't live near a bus line so switching to the bus instead of driving like we did last time gas prices peaked is out of the question.  We can make fewer driving trips of course but neither one of us wants to be forced to stay home all of the time.  I'm seriously thinking about solar energy for our new house so I was wondering about solar energy to power a car...hmmm.I hope you all have a wonderful weekend!"},
{"title": "Today I Changed Back to a Not So Smart Phone", "date": "Thursday, February 23, 2012", "text": "A while back I wrote about changing up to a nice, new Android smart phone (it's the pretty one in the picture on the left).  Unfortunately, along with the upgrade, came an upgrade in the price of the monthly pre-paid fee for using the phone.  With a regular not-so-smart phone, the cost for the TMobile pre-paid plan was $30 per month for 1500 talk/text minutes and some basic internet access.  With the smart phone, I was required to pay $50 for the unlimited talk/text/internet plan because the phone used up so much internet that the minuscule amount that came with the $30 plan only lasted a few days.Sooo...I have been paying the higher fee and enjoying my smart phone for a few months but today, when I thought about going to pay my monthly fee for next month's service, it dawned on me that I really don't enjoy my smart phone THAT much.  I pondered whether it was worth the extra $20 per month that I spent to have the smart phone and then I realized that it wasn't.  As it is, I am online at least four or five hours each day on my computer so it isn't really necessary to have speedy internet access 24/7 on my phone.  I use very few apps, I never watch videos on my phone or listen to music on it, and, while I enjoy reading the news on my phone, the screen is pretty tiny so it isn't something I do for hours on end.  This morning I made the decision to switch back to a basic cell phone which has the important things (talk and text) plus allows me to access the internet if necessary (but at a super slow speed).  I bought a $50 basic TMobile cell phone from Best Buy (I probably could have saved more money on this by checking CraigsList first but I didn't; also note that it is cheaper to buy TMobile phones at Walmart or Best Buy than at the actualy TMobile store for some reason...) then changed my plan back to the $30 per month plan.  The smart phone will be CraigsListed soon and go to someone else who doesn't mind paying the higher monthly fee.  Overall this will save me $20 per month ($240 per year!), and since, when I had the smart phone I felt like hubby should have one too, and in fact I was going to buy him the same phone, reverting back to a basic phone will actually save us $480 per year.Will I miss having a snazzy, modern phone (I swear, every child I see these days has a phone that resembles--or actually is--an iPhone!)?  Maybe, but I think saving money on something that is basically there to massage my ego but actually doesn't do much more for me than a basic not-so-smart phone is well worth the savings."},

Ayayay.  Kids. Anyway, I will quit whining.  Now I am going to spend a bit of time reading all of your blogs which I have been sadly remiss in doing for the past couple of weeks!"},
{"title": "Finally My Taxes Are Done!", "date": "Sunday, February 19, 2012", "text": "This is the first year in memory that I was absolutely thrilled to do our taxes.  I used the online H and R Block program which was super easy (even with selling a house and self employment income last year) and super inexpensive ($30).  And, for the first time in memory we actually got money back!  Within a week or so we are expecting $1700 to be deposited into our bank account complements of Uncle Sam (actually complements of hubby's pension earnings...seems we should change our withholding allowance so we won't be loaning so much money to the government, interest free, throughout the year though).  Before, we (actually I) always owed money in taxes because I have been self employed for over a decade and while I (usually) paid my quarterly taxes, I always came up short and owing at the end of the year.  This year I have very little self employment income and while our income puts us at way below middle class standards, we actually feel \"richer\" than we have felt in years.  So...our refund this year will be used for earnest money on the house we will make an offer on at the end of this month.  Along with a zero down VA loan, we should--hopefully--be moved into our own house soon!"},
{"title": "10 Money-Saving Laundry Tips and Some Last Words on Our Electricity Experiment", "date": "Saturday, February 18, 2012", "text": "We got our electric bill today and I am happy to report that it was $69 (down from $112 last month).  After keeping track of our electricity use each day for a month we came to the conclusion that the biggest use of electricity in our home is doing laundry--mostly using the dryer.  So here's how we have managed to keep control of our laundry costs and save money:We switched from warm wash/warm rinse to cold wash/cold rinse.  This saves us the cost of heating the water and I haven't even noticed a difference in the cleanliness of the clothes.I use bleach on the whites so it kills the germs that most people use hot water wash to accomplish.I only use half of the recommended amount of laundry soap in each load of laundry because our clothes really aren't that dirty.I have considered making my own laundry soap (like this) but haven't got around to it yet.  This may help us save even more money.I clean the lint filer in the dryer after each load (I don't want the dryer to work any harder than necessary!).I used to just turn the dryer on for 60-70 minutes but now I turn it on for 30 minutes and add time in increments of 10 minutes if needed (usually our clothes only need about 40 minutes in the dryer to dry completely).I shake out the clothes before I put them into the dryer.  It seems like this makes the clothes easier to dry than leaving them in a clump.I cut our dryer sheets in half (this gives me twice as many dryer sheets per box while cutting down on the chemicals that are spinning around with my clothes).Ideally I would like to hang our clothes to dry since the weather here is perfect nearly year round but the condo association would frown on this.  When we move I am definitely getting a drying rack or clothes line.I try to wear my clothes twice and use my bath towels twice before throwing them into the dirty laundry hamper.  I have never done this before but hubby always does so I thought I would give it a try.  It does decrease the amount of laundry I need to wash each week."},
{"title": "I'm Back!", "date": "Thursday, February 16, 2012", "text": "I just spent two days in the ER of our local hospital.  They were super busy so it took forever to get all of the tests done that the doctors ordered (and also because my insurance only covers office visits in Seattle, which I didn't know, so my doctor said I should go to the ER here in Las Vegas ASAP which my insurance would cover).  Anyway, after much testing they came to the stunning conclusion that...they didn't know what was wrong with me.  They ruled out of the usual ER stuff like stroke and heart attack, and one of the ER doctors even said she had seen cases similar to mine and probably wouldn't be able to give me a diagnosis (something about there is a specific diagnosis if an arm or leg is kind of numb but not if it includes the torso) so I am back to square one and this.On the bright side, at least I had insurance.  I am guessing that my stay would have cost more than $10,000(!) and I am envying our Canadian friends who have way better health insurance than the average American.The hospital's supposedly free wi-fi wasn't working so I had only my cell phone (which I have never used for blogging) and a couple of books with me (which I finished the morning of day two so was bored for the entire day while I waited and waited) to keep me occupied.  I also realized that when I am ill, I would prefer to hole up in a cave until I am better rather than tell anyone about it (I though, briefly, about Tweeting about my situation but was kind of horrified that people would then start calling).  So I guess I will continue to live with my weird-feeling right side and hope it goes away.  Also, here are somethings I learned:If you don't have health insurance in America, a simple visit to the ER can bankrupt you!Note to self, change insurance plans so I have regular medical coverage in Las Vegas.Bring your own food to the hospital.  I was kind of spoiled when I was working at some hospitals in the Seattle area that had amazing food.  The food at this hospital was atrocious.Bring something to entertain yourself (although I am guessing that most ER patients are too busy concentrating on living to worry about being entertained).Get to the hospital early.  I came in at 6am and ended up with my own room.  People who arrived mid day got the ER hallway.  Those who arrived later got the ambulance bay. Eekkk.Even if you Google your symptoms and kind of know what is wrong with you, you really should go to the hospital if you have a sudden onset of any sort of serious medical symptoms.  I ended up with an extremely thorough set of medical test and a very good bill of health (crappy diet and all...I was surprised), but it could have just as easily turned out that I had a mild stroke or something so it is a good idea to make certain instead of guess.And thanks for the well wishes!"},
{"title": "What the Heck is Wrong With Me???", "date": "Sunday, February 12, 2012", "text": "I posted last week about some dental pain I was having and now I think there is a bigger problem.  After the dental pain went away, I woke up the next day with literally the entire right side of my body having a weird feeling on my skin.  It was like hot and cold and tingly patches but when I looked at my skin it looked perfectly normal.  I thought I was having a stroke so I did a quick stroke test (again do-it-yourself-medicine) and I seemed fine (gait was normal, smile was even, lifted arms and both were even, grabbed hubby's hands and both grips were even).  I didn't run to the doctor immediately because all of my systems seemed fine (breathing fine, blood pressure fine, blood sugar fine, bones fine, muscles fine, no headache, no joint pain).  Then, of course, I Googled away and found this and this which sound exactly like my symptoms.  So I am guessing that it may be a vitamin deficiency (my diet has been crap lately), a virus (which I kind of thought when the dental pain went away so quick...sometimes viruses move around your body and I did have a wart on my finger recently when I got rid of which is caused by a virus), MS (which kind of freaks me out because my mom had severe MS towards the end of her life), environmental toxins (too many to list in the area we recently moved to), stress (I really have no reason to stress but literally every day in Las Vegas makes me stressed so I'm thinking I might not like to live here), something I picked up in Asia when we were traveling, or nerve damage from a few huge bruises I had on my right leg after we moved here (I fell over a fence on New Years and it left a half dozen huge bruises on my leg and before that I gave myself a huge bruise when we were moving furniture.So tomorrow I will call my doctor in Seattle and I am sure she will tell me to see a neurologist.  I would like to fly back up to Seattle because medical care there is really excellent and my doctor is great but since we are officially living in Las Vegas I am thinking I should probably find a doctor here.  The good thing is that we have good insurance that covers just about everything, anywhere we are.  The bad thing is...I am not a fan of doctors, clinics, hospitals, medical tests, etc. and would be happy with a nice naturopathic cure for whatever this is.  Yikes."},

We will cook up a feast and have a nice dinner with everyone to celebrate his birthday--no big plans this year and with a super limited income, a homemade dinner and a homemade birthday cake (by me) will have to suffice.  I think the thing I miss the most about not having a lot of money is that I can't splurge on people for special occasions.I decided not to do the business with my friends (this is the dodging the bullet part).  After a bit of thought, I decided that doing this would violate a number of unwritten rules that I have about business, among them, never do a partnership, never go into business with friends, don't have a business with overhead, don't have employees, and don't mix friends and money.  My friends have already moved forward to start their own business (they got the business license so far) and I will do what I can for them (order their business cards, make up flyers for them, make them a website and host it for the first year at my expense) to help get their business started.  This won't cost me much money (my services and the couple of low expenses will be my gift to them) and it will encourage them to have a successful business but will not make me any part of the business so I think this will work out much better...I did my taxes with the H & R Block online tax program which I used last year.  For the first time in over a decade we are actually getting money back!  There is one more form that I need to file the taxes which hasn't been released by the IRS yet so I hope to get this finished up and e-filed by next week.As soon as I file the taxes I will send a copy of the taxes over to the lender so we can get a pre-approval letter for a mortgage and at the end of the month we will begin searching for a house to buy.I need to work more on being a writer.  This type of business fits all of my criteria for a business (it's portable, there is no overhead, I can work by myself, etc), and it's something I love to do (I just need to get motivated to actually sit down and write!).Tomorrow is caucus day in Nevada so I will go to my first presidential caucus.  This should be interesting!If you haven't heard of the MIT Open Courseware program, you should definitely check it out.  This is a free way to get an education (unfortunately not an actual degree but the knowledge is very valuable in and of itself) and now they are offering a free certificate program called MITx.  I think this will really become the future of education.Finally, did you know that I love to read romance novels?  These kinds of books are like brain candy to me since I usually read non-fiction books which aren't nearly as entertaining.  I just came across a new author who is a ridiculously good writer, her name is Julia Quinn.I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and drive safe out there--it's Super Bowl weekend!"},

(sadly most of that money went to interest, over limit fees and late fees).  I was such an idiot.Fortunately we (eventually) got our act together and got out of debt and our monthly bill list now looks much more reasonable:Rent $600Electricity $112 (but going down next month!)Cell phones $80Health insurance $35Car insurance $33 (liability only for one--paid for--car)Son's family in the Philippines $95Tithe $50Basically it was a three step process to go from over-the-top bills to spending a fraction of the cost to keep us fed, sheltered, and entertained each month.  The first step was paying off debt as quickly as possible and not using credit cards any more.  The second step was cutting down on the cost of things we can't do without (ie: we don't need a big house but we do need shelter so a small, one bedroom condo works very well for us and, fortunately the rental fee covers water, sewer, and garbage).  The third step was doing without things that don't impact us too greatly (ie: no cable, liability only car insurance, cheaper cell phone plans, no newspaper since I now read this online, etc).Now that the trip down memory lane is done, I never want to go back there!  I'm debating whether to burn the notebook or keep it as a reminder in case I ever edge toward debt again..."},
{"title": "An Update on the Electricity Experiment, Some Links, and My New Business", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2012", "text": "It's been kind of busy around here!  Here's what's been happening...Electricity Experiment:I have been watching our electricity consumption like a hawk this past week and unfortunately it looks like our super high electricity bill I blogged about a while back was our own fault.  We were pretty spoiled by Washington's electricity rates (plus by having a house that used natural gas as well which is much cheaper than electricity).  After reading our meter daily for the past week, we have a much better handle on how we ended up with such a high bill and a much better idea of ways that we can conserve electricity.  Here's the results of our meter reading:January 21--used 21 kwh (didn't use heat but did one load of laundry and baked)January 22--used 18 kwh (used the heat pump/central heat to heat the place)January 23--used 17 kwh (used space heaters to heat the place)January 24--used 23 kwh (did one load of laundry and used the space heaters)January 25--used 13 kwh (no cooking, no laundry, and only used the space heater for about 30 minutes)So yes, the bill was probably correct as it showed that we averaged about 30 kwh per day.  Now because we are paying attention to our electricity used we are able to keep it at an average of about 20 kwh per day so we are hoping our next bill will be about 30% lower!  Tonight we should have higher usage because I plan to bake some granola, bake a pizza for dinner, and do about three loads of laundry so we will keep checking our meter each day probably for the next month or so and hopefully still be able to average about 20 kwh per day.Links:Here's some links you might enjoy...How we paid cash for our first home (this family rocks!)1000 days after overnight success (some excellent business tips)Lists of note (I just came across this website and I LOVE lists so thought this was cool)A cash mob for a small town store (I LOVE this town! What a great thing to do for a small business!)Success books (I was feeling a bit aimless and needing some inspiration so I am now reading down my list of favorite success books which I listed here on my other blog)My New Business:I have been thinking abouts some business ideas (to me a real job seems like a prison sentence...I am much happier as a business owner) and since my friends moved down here recently and are in need of work, I have decided on a new business that I plan to start within the next month or so.  My friend's husband is a handyman/painter/all around useful guy and he has been working on and off doing carpet cleaning.  We talked about the idea of him having his own carpet cleaning business and after doing some research it looks like this would be a low cost (about $3000) kind of business to get started and once the machine is paid off, his only expense would be the carpet cleaning chemicals.  I will do a bit more research before I commit to this but I have done similar businesses in the past (started businesses for friends then sold the business to the person after a while) and it has worked out well.  I'll let you know how this goes.I hope you are all having a wonderful week!p.s. It's near 70 degrees and sunny this week in Las Vegas.  I think this is the best January we have ever experienced--nice weather will do that for a person."},
{"title": "The Great Electricity Experiment", "date": "Monday, January 23, 2012", "text": "My last post was lamenting our super high electricity bill (p.s. thanks everyone for your good input on this!).  Since we got the bill we decided to do a little experiment.  Every day we write down the electric meter reading in the morning when we leave and in the evening when we return.  We are making notes on what electric appliances we use each day and we are also experimenting with the use of these appliances.  On the 21st, the reading was 1842 in the morning and 1843 in the evening.  It looks like the condo uses one kwh (kilowatt hour) while we are gone for the day.  That evening I baked some cornbread in the regular oven and did one load of laundry.  The next morning (the 22nd) the morning reading was 1863 (a total of 20 kwh used mostly, I think, by the dryer and the oven).  That afternoon (on the 22nd) the reading was 1864 so again, the condo only used 1 kwh while we were gone.  On the evening of the 22nd, we decided to use the central heating/heatpump system to heat the place instead of the space heaters.  This morning (the 23rd) the meter read 1881 (a total of 17 kwh) used since yesterday.  We shut the central heat off this morning when we left and tonight when we get home I won't do laundry but we will use the space heaters to see if they use more electricity then the central heating system does.An interesting way to approach the problem but I really want to see why our electric bill was so high.  Judging by the amount of electricity used on the first day, and thinking back to how many loads of laundry we did when we first moved in (a lot--all of our sheets, towels, clothes, etc that were in storage) I am pretty sure the bill was correct and we just used a ton of electricity with the dryer and by washing all of the laundry in warm water. Eeekkk...This must be why EVERYONE in Japan hangs their clothes to dry--even the very wealthy.  Electricity costs A LOT!"},
{"title": "I Just Got My Electricity Bill and Nearly Fainted!", "date": "Saturday, January 21, 2012", "text": "I was kind of eager to get our first electricity bill, blissfully thinking that with a such a small place and with the fact that we are hardly ever home, I would have a small monthly bill to rave about.  Turns out I was wrong (see bill above).That amount is more than double what we used to pay for electricity in our hold house which was like five times bigger than the small condo we are living in now.  Color me shocked (and appalled, and unhappy...).  This is what I am doing about it:I am going to contact our cousin who lived in the condo before us to see what her average bill was (she should be back next week).I also posted this question on a local Las Vegas bulletin board to find out if this was indeed an average bill and the consensus was that for the small space and only having two people live there it was pretty high.I went out to read the meter today and will read it every day for a month to keep track of our own usage and see if it measures up with what the electricity company says we use.I will call the electric company and ask them about this and see if they have any idea why it was so high (I'm kind of dreading this because it is a minimum 30-40 minute wait on hold just to talk to someone).I am now washing our clothes in cold water.  Right after we moved in I did a ton (literally) of laundry, all in warm water.  Plus with the use of the dryer I am thinking that racked up a lot of electricity usage.  I'm even pondering hanging our clothes outside to dry (a practice frowned on by the condo board I think.  Maybe I can hang clothes at night so they won't see it).I checked this website and found that electricity rates are much higher in Nevada than what we paid in Washington.  Bummer.We already switched to a low-flow shower head (that last thing I want to part with is my hot showers in the morning).We have been using a small space heater in whatever room we are in so we didn't use the furnace to heat the entire place but now I am wondering if these draw more electricity than a heat pump system.  Don't know where I would find out if this is true or not...I went around and unplugged everything we aren't using (computer printer, DVD player, etc).  Not sure how much this will help.I guess I need to wrap my head around the fact that an all electric house is just going to cost more.  In our last house we used natural gas for heating and hot water so I think this made our electricity bill there significantly lower.I am kind of dreading summer time when we will need to run the AC 24/7.

{"title": "Our Vegas \"Vacation\"", "date": "Thursday, January 19, 2012", "text": "Last weekend I was MIA on the blog here for a few days which you might have noticed (actually you probably didn't because I'm not very good about blogging every day but anyway...).  The reason I was missing was because the hubby and I took a weekend \"vacation\" in Las Vegas.  Which is weird considering we live in Las Vegas but ever since we ditched our \"normal\" life over a year ago, many of our days are unusual.So this is what happened:Hubby's cousin came over to Vegas last Friday from LA (one of many cousins, in fact his family FaceBook group has over 450 members!).  She had some comps she had to use at a casino and ended up booking two free suites at the Rio but she had no one to use one of the suites so she talked us into staying there for the weekend.  I didn't really want to \"travel\" across town just to stay in a hotel because I was pretty comfy in our little condo but hubby said it would be like a vacation (as if we need another vacation) so we packed up our weekend bags and headed out.  Here's the financial rundown on our Las Vegas vacation:A nice suite at the Rio for two nights (free thanks to the cousin)Breakfast on day one at the Rio (free from the cousin that hubby hadn't seen in over 40 years.  Also it was expensive as I guess the casino thinks they have a captive audience and can charge outlandish prices)Went to the Bellagio so I could take some pictures of their conservatory (see photo above; free), went to check out the Aria, a newish casino we hadn't visited before, then went to the M Resort, another place we hadn't visited before (and we each got a free t shirt for signing up for their player's club card).Deciding to do touristy thing, we waited in a rather long line at Serendipity Restaurant at Caesar's Palace because I had heard good things about their frozen hot chocolate (notice how at the bottom of the article is says they got a Guinness World Record for most expensive dessert?  I didn't know that and when we found out one small cup of this concoction cost $10(!) we promptly left without buying anything...I might be on \"vacation\" but I am not going to spend that much money on a small dessert!).We ate lunch across from the Rio at the Gold Coast's Ping Pang Pong Chinese Restaurant (which is amazingly good and was free because we used hubby's casino comps).We then went to the Freemont Experience downtown and walked around.  We skipped the ziplines as it was pretty expensive (around $20 to send each of us flying above the crowd on Freemont Street...plus hubby hates heights).  Still wanting an interesting dessert, we went to the Heart Attack Grill (aptly named when you see the menu) and I got a chocolate milkshake (made out of butter cream instead of milk; cost $6 including tip.  It was super rich and they made you put on a hospital gown in order to go into the restaurant but it was a typically touristy thing to do).  Note that if you weigh over 350 pounds you get to eat free at this restaurant; note too that I'm sure they won't pay your hospital bills if you do indeed end up with a heart attack while scarfing down their burger monstrosities.  We also found a 99 cent shrimp cocktail at one of the small casinos on Freemont Street; I had though these were all but gone in this day and age but one place in Las Vegas still has them (at the Lanai Express).We gambled a bit at the Fitzgerald Casino and I ended up winning $50 on Pai Gow so thus far our vacation is actually more than paying for itself!Towards the end of the evening we went back out to Freemont and joined in on some impromptu dancing (there are a few stage areas on this street where DJs set up their music and play for the crowd and the crowd joins in and dances).  We love dancing (this was free).With all that walking we headed back to the room early, watched the Miss America Pageant on TV (which was actually being shown live from down the street) and promptly fell asleep!The next day hubby went to play poker and my friends and I headed over to the Broadacres Swap Meet.  This is a huge outdoor swap meet where you can literally find anything you are looking for--from beds and kitchen sinks to food and clothing and shampoo.  It cost $1.50 to get in but they do have live bands all day which were great to listen to.  We were trying to think of what kind of business we could have at the swap meet but then decided that none of us want to be working outside in the summer in Las Vegas.My friends and I had a late lunch at Ellis Island which offers a great steak dinner special for only $7.95 (it comes with salad, rolls, steak, potato, vegetables, and a beer or root beer which is made on the premises...yum!).In the evening the hubby and I walked around the Rio just to see what was going on (they have a free circus-themed show to watch) then ended up eating there for dinner (in their Chinese restaurant which is really quite expensive but we figured that driving somewhere and tipping would cost about the same).The next morning we checked out and went home.tl;dr  Las Vegas can be pricey and intimidating but there are still plenty of things to do for free or cheap that will keep you entertained.  For more ideas, check out these free things to do in Las Vegas."},

{"title": "Traumatized By Grocery Shopping", "date": "Tuesday, January 17, 2012", "text": "Last week the hubby and I were up by the military base so we decided to hit up the base commissary for some groceries.  Now we used to do this each week, religiously, especially when we had a house full of kids.  It was pretty routine to go to the commissary each week, go to some grocery stores in town and pick up a bunch of loss leaders, then make a Costco run once a month as well.  Needless to say we ended up with a lot of food and some pretty big grocery shopping bills but we figured that the money was well spent as it went to keep us and kids fed plus gave us extra groceries to stockpile in case of emergency.  Oddly enough we never really paid attention to how much we actually spent on groceries and since, at the time, we often ate out a lot too, we ended up throwing out quite a few items in the fridge each week that had morphed into balls of green slime.  Yikes.Fast forward to last week.  I'm not sure what come over us--besides the really good prices on most grocery items at the commissary--but we started filling our basket with all kinds of canned food, produce, meat, and other things that looked tasty.  Unfortunately when we got through the check out line, we ended up with a bill for $117.30!!!  We haven't shopped like this in over a year!  I guess we got kind of carried away with the fact that we now have an actual home and an actual kitchen and we immediately reverted back to our old ways.  Bad idea.We were both still reeling from the shock when we got home and put away all of the groceries and we decided then and there that we would never grocery shop like that again.  Over the past year we have learned to shop for only the items we will be cooking during the next few days.  No stockpiling, no taking advantage of low prices and buying a case of a product when we only need one or two cans.  And you know what?  This method has saved us a lot of money.  It has allowed us to cut down on the amount of food that we waste as well as made us use up all of the perishable items we bought instead of using a bit of this item and bit of that item and leaving the rest to moulder away in the veggie bin.  Most importantly, we aren't buying all kinds of things that we will never use and eventually end up giving away to the food bank or throwing away because the item has reached it expiration date.It may seem wasteful to some people not to buy in bulk but we have found that for just the two of us, buying a minimum amount of groceries at a time is the best way for us to shop and allows us to save a lot of money too!"},

{"title": "I Love Free Stuff!", "date": "Friday, January 6, 2012", "text": "When we first moved into our condo I found that I was using a lot of hot water when I showered.  In our house we always used low-flow shower heads, mostly because of my penchant for long, hot shower and also because we didn't want to receive huge water bills.  Now that we are renting a condo, the water is actually free--it's included in the monthly condo fee--but the electricity to heat the water isn't free and I am kind of afraid to see what our first official electric bill will be.  So...after checking Walmart for low-flow shower heads and finding that they were around $12, I decided to see if I could find one for free, and, surprise, I did!  That's them in the picture above.  Here's a bunch of cool free things you may be able to find in your community:Low-flow shower heads and sink faucet aerators.  Many utility/water companies will provide these for free to help their customers conserve water and save money.Energy audit and insulation.  Some electric companies will provide free energy audits and insulation products in order to help their customers conserve electricity and save money.Fire/smoke detectors.  Local fire departments often give these away for free in order to reduce the risk of house fires and keep their constituents safe.Vaccinations.  The health district where I used to live would hold bi-annual vaccination clinics where they would provide basic vaccinations (hepatitis, tetanus, influenza, etc) for free to anyone in the community who wanted them.  Bicycle helmets.  The fire districts where I used to live provided bicycle helmets for free to anyone in the community who wanted one.  There was a big push to prevent bicycling injuries, especially for children, and there were a lot of grant funds expended to make sure anyone who wanted a helmet could have one.Child safety seats and booster seats.  There were a couple of organizations in our former community that also provided free child safety seats and booster seats for those who needed them.  Usually there was a requirement that the people who received the seats were low income but no one was turned away if they really needed one.Life jackets.  Again, there were a couple of organizations that would also provide life jackets to those in need (we lived in a community surrounded by water).Health services.  A random assortment of health services--everything from blood pressure checks to diabetes checks to mammograms and pap tests--may be provided free of charge at various locations around your community.  Health fairs may offer some of these services, and pharmacies often provide simple blood pressure screenings, while health districts and free clinics may offer more clinical-type services (there are a couple of nation-wide grant programs that provide free mammograms and paps through various community health organizations, while pregnancy tests and HIV tests are usually provided free through health departments).CPR classes.  Fire departments and the Red Cross often offer free CPR/basic first aid classes to the public.Free classes.  I am a big fan of learning new things so I check a variety of websites (library, local university, online newspaper, etc) to find out if there are any free classes being held in the community that I can attend (I got my HAM radio operator license once this way because the class was being offered free of charge).So while you are thinking about low cost ways to get the things you need (food, department store items) also consider that the items you want and need may be free.  Try Googling free plus the name of the item you want plus the name of your city or town and see what pops up!"},
{"title": "My Two Challenges for the Month...And How They Have Been Adjusted", "date": "Wednesday, January 4, 2012", "text": "After yesterday, I figured out a few things.  First, if I am to not spend money or eat junk food for a month I better be held captive in a remote place with no hope of running into my friends, a store, or a fast food place for the entire month.  That being said, I do want to reap some of the benefits of these challenges so this is what I have changed:Whole 30/Paleo Challenge.  This is what I wanted to do, and what happens when you don't do it right.  I even had this nifty paleo grocery shopping guide.  And then I ran into some friends and collectively we ran into In N Out Burger...and boy did that burger taste good.  But oddly, a bit after eating the burger, I had a weird feeling.  I am thinking it was the wheat in the bun that made me get this odd cough that I always got after eating except I hadn't noticed it at all the few days that I didn't eat any wheat.  Then I thought hmmm.  If, as I have suspected for some time, wheat has such an impact on me, I certainly didn't want to throw in the towel on the whole diet thing.  But at the same time, I am pretty convinced that I can't do a strict paleo diet because, well, I really do love food.  Greek food, Chinese food, Mexican food, French food, Thai food...you name it and I will probably want to eat it.  So...I decided that while the challenge may be a fail, making better choices in the food I eat is doable.  So today, I just decided to eat what I want but to make better choices.  We went to lunch at The Palms today and their buffet is awesome.  Instead of eating everything there, I started with a big salad then moved on to vegetables, salmon, and a couple of beef ribs.  I skipped the beautiful dessert trays and had fruit for dessert.  I also skipped anything with wheat (such as breaded and fried anything and the pita that would have been good wrapped around the falafel balls and tzatziki sauce which I ate by itself), but did have some dairy (couldn't pass up the mozzarella and tomato salad).  Also, hubby thought I would cave and head to Baskin Robbins but I didn't and the only snack-type item we have at home is fresh fruit so I will try to avoid bringing any junk food into the house.  Overall an OK compromise (but I would have really liked to do 30 days of strict paleo just to see what would happen!).No Spend Challenge.  Again, I seem to not be able to not spend.  So I have decided to watch what I spend but try to justify each item I purchase (and hopefully talk myself out of buying things I don't really need).  Today hubby spent $1 on the slot machine while he was waiting for me (and won $13).  We also had a nice buffet lunch which was free from the comps he received from the casino.  That was all of the money we spent today.  I will probably be shelling out $95 for karate lessons this month which I will justify by saying that earning a black belt is one of my goals for this year AND that at six lessons a week or 24 lessons a month, the $95 breaks down to a bit less than $4 per lesson which is a bargain.So there you have it.  I have very little willpower, unfortunately, but I will use what little I have to make small changes over time which will (hopefully) lead to bigger and better changes in the future!"},

use the money to help cover your rent/mortgage payment.Check into any discounts/special rentals you may be entitled to (ie: senior housing, disabled housing, discounts for veterans, etc).If you are flat broke, unemployed and/or disabled/have small kids, sign up for welfare and get on the Section 8 housing list (this will give you a place at greatly reduced rent; unfortunately in most cities this waiting list is incredibly LONG).Reconsider whether you need cable TV.  We bought a digital antenna to catch over the air TV signals and are pretty please with it.Reconsider whether you need a house phone.  Our cell phones work perfectly where we live so we don't even need a house phone.On another phone note, if you are low income or disabled, look into low income phone service (some companies will offer steeply discounted cell and/or home phone service to people in these groups).Reconsider whether you need internet at home.  We rarely use internet at home as I do most of my online stuff at the library each day plus I have internet on my phone so we have skipped internet and now use an \"iffy\" signal that is free at the condo complex if needed.Use space heaters, blankets, and other \"old fashioned\" ways to keep warm instead of turning on the furnace and heating your entire house.Ditto for air conditioning.  Keep the curtains pulled to keep the sun out, use window fans to move the air, and consider looking into single room air conditioners to keep only the room you are in cool instead of cooling the entire house.Check into what kind of garbage plans are available where you live.  In rentals, garbage is often included but when you are buying a house you usually have to pay your own garbage bill.  We were able to reduce our garbage bill from two big cans weekly when everyone was living at home to one small can every other week when it was just the hubby and I.Conserve water.  Last week, I Googled around for free low flow shower heads in our area and found that the water district was providing an entire water-use reduction kit for free just for asking (we will get free low flow shower heads, kitchen and bathroom sink aerators, and some brochures in a packet they will be mailing out today).Conserve electricity.  Besides using fluorescent light bulbs and using space heaters only when necessary, we really try to keep our electricity use as low as possible by doing everything from turning off lights when not in use, to keeping things that use electricity (DVD player that we don't use much, etc) unplugged unless we are using them.On another electricity note, our friends here in Las Vegas all seem to be on the electric company's \"budget plan\" which averages out their bills each month so they don't have super low bills in the winter and super high bills in the summer.We also try to conserve natural gas in the same way--by being aware of when and how we are using it and reducing our usage as much as possible.Get homeowners/renters insurance!  While this will be an added cost each month, it will be well worth it if anything happens to your home like a break-in or a fire.We always keep a running list of things we need for our home.  When we first moved in it was long and included everything from ziploc bags to pillows.  Now it isn't so long.  This keeps us from buying tings we don't need and also keeps us from making multiple trips to the store because we forgot something.My friends called to see where the nearest department store was so they cold buy housewares.  I told them the best way to get stuff for your house is to start with your list at the Dollar Store, then hit up thrift stores and garage sales, then go to Walmart, then try Ross or TJ Maxx, then make your final stop at the department store (and hopefully by then you will have bought everything on your list and have saved a considerable amount of money).We learned to put our \"house\" money towards items we use every day (a good pan set, a good knife set) and spend as little as possible on things like home decor (when we sold all of our stuff before we traveled last year, home decor items had very little resale value!).Look at bartering.  I have known a few people who have been able to \"barter\" their way to free housing.  This included taking care of an elderly person and getting free room and board and bartering work on a farm for the free use of a guest house for a family of four.A few other people I know have received free housing (usually an apartment) by being managers of apartments or storage unit companies (with an on-site apartment for the caretaker/manager).Minimize your stuff, not only will you make some money on the sale of your stuff, you will be able to clear out the storage unit you are paying extra for each month and/or clean out some spare rooms that could possibly be used for rentals.  At the least, you will have less stuff to maintain, insure, and keep track of.If you are flat broke and low income/disabled/a veteran/a senior check into other discounts you are entitled to (ie: some counties have programs that allow seniors to pay less in property tax for their homes; many communities have programs that pay for a month or two of utilities for people who are low income, etc).Don't try to impress others.  Whether it is buying the huge house so you can make a prosperous impression on your friends and relatives or buying only name-brand items for your home (when a cheaper item from the Dollar Store or Walmart would serve the purpose just as well); the desire to impress can lead to financial ruin so check your ego and go frugal--you'll save a lot of money and most people will applaud you for your creativity and have no idea that you got everything to decorate your living room at the Goodwill!"},
{"title": "Happy New Year!", "date": "Sunday, January 1, 2012", "text": "Welcome 2012 and I hope we all have a happy and prosperous new year!Here's an update on my two challenges for this month:No spend challenge.  I thought this was going to be blown out of the water on day one because my friends that just moved here called me and wanted to meet up.  Of course much of our meeting up revolves around food--what else--so we met at a local taco shop and while I offered to pay (out of habit, before I even remembered the challenge), my friend's husband insisted on paying.  So day one was a success--nothing spent today.Paleo challenge.  I actually started this challenge yesterday.  Since I was home all day yesterday cleaning, it was easy to eat all paleo which I did.  Then I woke up with a pounding headache this morning (I'm thinking it was because of the lack of caffeine, sugar and carbs that weren't a part of my diet yesterday...bummer).  All was well in paleo-land until I met with my friends (above) and I had two carne asada tacos (in corn tortillas, even though corn is a vegetable, it counts as a grain for the purposes of paleo) so this was a slight hiccough in the plan but I don't feel like it was a critical lapse so I stuck with paleo food for the rest of the day and will move onward and upward tomorrow.On another note we did go to the Strip last night to ring in the New Year. Hubby loved it--all of the people and excitement and fireworks he found exciting.  I would have been happy with the fireworks sans people and excitement but it was important to hubby so I went (and nearly got trampled when shortly after midnight tens of thousands of people all headed for the same outlet street).  Hubby and I jumped over a fence to get out of their way and now I have a neat line of bruises across my leg (and a very good reason to do some strength training since years--and years--ago I could do one handed push up but now I can barely haul my self over a fence using both hands without damage.  Bummer."},
{"title": "A Couple of Days Until the End of the Year...An Update", "date": "Friday, December 30, 2011", "text": "Actually there isn't a lot to update but I wanted to drop in and say \"hi\".  Here's what's up:I told you last time that I was going to do the Whole 30 Challenge in January.  Towards that end, we went to the store today and made a haul of meat, fruit, and vegetables.  Hubby seems very supportive--he kept asking what other things we could get for me to eat during the upcoming week--but he doesn't want to join me in the challenge because he would miss his rice too much. BUT he said that if he could see a real difference over the month that I am doing the challenge, he would do it the following month which is probably the most inspiring thing I have heard from him (and an excellent motivator for me since I want him to be as healthy as possible).  Needless to say, I'm psyched!  Plus I keep reading these stories and want to be one of them eventually!My friends are moving to Las Vegas!  They are driving down from Seattle and should be here this evening.  Actually they had lived in Las Vegas before and liked it here so when my friend's husband got laid off, they sold everything in their small apartment and hit the road for Vegas.  Yeah!  Plus they are interested in starting some sort of business here and so am I so I think we will be able to do some collaboration that will benefit all of us!Speaking of the Whole 30 Challenge, I picked up my Baskin Robbins Blast today (believe it or not, they always have it waiting for me as soon as I walk into the place--I am there about every other day!) and told the owner that he probably wouldn't see me for at least a month because I am trying a diet challenge and he said they always notice a steep drop in customers around the beginning of the year for the same reason.  Originally I had changed to Baskin Robbins because I loved the Starbucks frappuccino and was having one every day but the price (over $5 at the Strip Starbucks) and the daily dose of caffeine, wasn't good for me.  So I found a Baskin Robbins close by the library I go to on an almost daily basis, found that the Blast which is similar to the Frappuccino was less than $4, and made it a habit to stop by every other day or every two days instead of daily.  Either way, this is an expensive and quite unhealthful habit so I hope with the Whole 30 challenge I won't see an ice creamy/caffeine-e drink for the next month or more!I may be getting a nice consulting gig.  During my money challenge back in November I told you about a friend who wanted me to do some work for her but I talked her out of it (and me out of the money) because I didn't think it was something they needed to do.  Anyway, she called me today and said her organization is moving forward with an even bigger project and she wants to fly down here to talk to me about it.  I would be doing some consulting work for her from afar and making more with this project than I would have with the last project.  I'm loving karma about now.Speaking of the money challenge, the funds continue to trickle in from things that I did that month (a common thing for freelance writers who don't get paid until their stuff is published).  Here is my most recently published article.I have a bunch of stuff to do tomorrow, the last day of the year, namely clean our place thoroughly (an old Jewish tradition, even though I am not Jewish), get the food prepped for the first week of my Whole 30 Challenge, and put some cash in my wallet (this is a Filipino tradition which states that if you start the year with money in your wallet you will increase it over the year but if you don't have any money in your wallet at the beginning of the year you will not have any over the course of the year either.  I'm not superstitious but still...makes sense to me.  Then tomorrow night we will venture onto the Strip (with hundreds of thousands of other people) to ring in the New Year.I am still not sure what I want to do on New Year's Day.  I like to do something interesting (previously I did a Volksmarch on New Year's Eve in Seattle, a \"Run for the Heroes\" 10k race in Gig Harbor on New Year's Day, and the Polar Bear Plunge in Olalla but it doesn't look like they have anything interesting to do here in Las Vegas on New Year's Day.  Maybe they anticipate most people to be hung over and sleeping after partying it up on New Year's Eve??).  So I may just try to walk the Strip or something.I think that's about all.  Hope your New Year's Eve is festive and your New Year is lucrative!"},
{"title": "A Couple of Challenges for January", "date": "Wednesday, December 28, 2011", "text": "Along with making some general resolutions for 2012, there are two challenges that I will be doing in January:The first is a no-spend challenge over at Carla's blog.  For the month of January, which, crossing my fingers, should be really quiet with not a lot going on, I will try to spend NO money for the month (except for food, see second challenge below).  Other than a few bills (cells, tithe, electricity, savings, grandson's school) I don't foresee anything coming up that I would NEED to spend money on (unlike this past month where there were all kinds of things popping up that required money).  If I can possibly get by without purchasing anything but food and paying my meager bills I will.  Even if something comes up (like I have been wanting a new pair of tennis shoes) I will try to put it off until February.  NO SPEND JANUARY!The second is a Whole 30 Challenge.  I have been wanting to \"go paleo\" for a while but with traveling and holidays and friends bearing yummy food and checking out restaurants in Las Vegas, I have failed miserably at past trials for this.  Anyway, I came across a Whole 30 challenge which is a strict paleo type of diet and for ONE MONTH, I am really going to buckle down and try my best to stay with this eating program.  I really want to see if it is as beneficial as they say and see how one month of concentrated effort and eating right impacts my body.  This is going to be way harder than not spending money because, well I LOVE food.  Ayayay   There is some more information on this challenge here and here.Do any of you have interesting challenges you will be trying in the new year?"},
{"title": "2011: The Year in Review", "date": "Monday, December 26, 2011", "text": "Since today is kind of a quiet day, I thought I would take a little trip down memory lane and see how things went for us over the past year.  Here's the round up:We sold our house at a good price.  The market was on the downward slide at the beginning of the year but since we had bought so long ago, we were still able to sell for more than what was owed on it and pocket some equity.With the proceeds from our home sale we were able to finally pay off all of our debts. Yeah!We spent the last year basically homeless (by choice) traveling which had been one of our goals for ages.  We always thought that if we wanted to travel we would have to be millionaires but learned that without a huge house payment and other bills/debts that go along with owning a home we could actually have the money to travel. What a light bulb moment!We traveled around for the past year and so many great things happened while on the road that I was in a state of near constant amazement.  We visited Atlanta and the SIL who we were staying with needed some help with her grand kids (basically taking them to pre school every day) so we ended up staying there for three months with free room and board and car and all kinds of other nice extras.  We stopped by Las Vegas so hubby could do the World Series of Poker tournament and found that house prices were super low so we immediately made an offer to buy a house there, determining that it didn't matter where we lived in the world but that having a really low house payment would go a long way towards letting us continue to travel.  We spent a couple of months in Seattle enjoying the nice summer weather, then we spent nearly a month in the Philippines visiting friends and relatives and I got to hop over to Japan for a week to visit friends I hadn't seen in ages (all expenses paid...I love serendipity!).  We came back to Seattle after our foray into Asia and found that our offer on the house in Las Vegas had fallen though so we packed up our stuff which had been in storage in Seattle and carted it down to Las Vegas since we knew that eventually we would be moving there.  We made six more offers on homes in Las Vegas and all fell through (FYI--short sales are a horrible way to buy a house quickly and when you are buying the lowest priced homes in the area, the competition with cash buyers who are looking for rental property investments is fierce!).  We stayed with a cousin in Las Vegas for a couple of months while we got our bearings then decided to rent another cousin's condo for a couple months before looking to buy a house (and it's a good thing we did--we had made offers to buy a couple of condos but after living in one for a couple of months we have definitely decided to buy a house!).I haven't worked for an entire year (a first since I was 16!) and we have found that we can both live pretty well on the hubby's retirement income!  Prior to this we had always assumed that it took two fairly large incomes to live happily but that isn't true.  With no debt and watching our spending we are actually living much better than we had in previous years!We've taken frugality to new heights.  With our year of living out of our backpacks, we found that we really don't need too much stuff to actually survive--laptops, cell phones, and a few changes of clothes and that's all we need!  Previous to this we thought we needed closets full of clothes and huge purchases of Costco food \"just in case\".  Now we buy only what we need for the immediate future, only what we will wear in the immediate future, and only what we will eat within a few days; this works out really well and saves us a ton of money.Because we have such a limited income, we scrutinize every single purchase no matter how small.  First, we try not to buy things that we don't absolutely need (mostly because at the beginning of the year we sold nearly everything we owned via garage sales and Craigslist and found that everything that we had paid top dollar for had a resale value of literally pennies on the dollar--a sobering reminder of the REAL price of the things we buy).  Also, since we have downsized our living space considerably (another thing we learned from traveling is that we can live quite comfortably in about 500 square feet!) we don't have the need to buy stuff just to fill up our living space--this also saves a lot of money.  Finally, and again due to our limited income, shopping is no longer a hobby.  If we don't have a burning need for something--and the cold, hard cash to purchase it--we simple don't go shopping.  I haven't seen a mall in months!Finally, we have learned to look at things that people assume you \"have to have\" in a new light.  Since we hadn't really watched much TV over the past year, we didn't really miss cable, so when it came time to decide on TV service for our condo, we bought a $20 antenna from Walmart and now can watch TV for free over the air.  We have always owned cars--sometimes up to six for two drivers!--but now we have one car for the both of us and with neither of us working, there isn't a need for more than one car since all of our driving trips can be easily coordinated (before with both of us working, having two cars was basically a necessity).  Fortunately we have both aged past the \"ego\" part of owning new, shiny, \"cool\" cars and have one paid-for family van that we will probably drive until it literally dies (alas it has no \"image\" to speak of at all).Overall, our entire year has centered around our new relationship to money.  Just a few years ago we were living paycheck to paycheck and deeply in debt and actually thought that was how we were supposed to be living because all 'normal' people lived that way.  Then we ran across the Dave Ramsey show on TV, caught the \"debt free\" bug, continued to watch Dave EVERY SINGLE DAY until his messages about money were burned into our memory, eventually got out of debt by shedding stuff we didn't need (cars, house, material goods), put our earnings toward paying off debt and living cash-only (which saved us a lot in spending even if the initial transition was semi-torturous), revelled in the freedom that came with literally not having a single debt, followed our dreams as far as our cash would take us (not super far but far enough from the daily grind that we had a wonderful year of travel), and have now landed on our feet in a new city, looking ahead to new goals for the coming year.  Whew!  What a lot of change we have had over the past year!"},
{"title": "Merry Christmas Everyone!", "date": "Sunday, December 25, 2011", "text": "Before I keel over on the couch in a turkey coma, I just wanted to wish you all a very Merry Christmas!  We had a wonderful Christmas eve dinner with the cousins and about 20 of their relatives last night, then we were up early again this morning for a big Christmas lunch with the same group.  We get a couple hour;s break then we are off to play in the cousin's annual Christmas day bowling tournament (which should be fun because nearly none of them actually bowl but they make a big deal out of this tournament which comes complete with actual trophies and everything!).  I hope you all are having a wonderful day with your friends and family!"},
{"title": "A Little Rave About the Hubby", "date": "Thursday, December 22, 2011", "text": "I wanted to rave a little bit about the hubby today.  For the past year, I have not worked (a first, since I have always worked full time since I was 16) and we have been getting by on hubby's pensions.  I feel a bit bad about not working, like I am not contributing as I should be and as I always have during our entire marriage, but hubby seems fine with me not working and hasn't mentioned a thing about me getting a job.  Anyway, today I really needed to get my gifts bought and sent to Japan but I have very little money and I knew this was going to be an expensive proposition (and I was right, the gifts were $250 and the shipping was $100!) so I told hubby I needed $350 out of our spending money for gifts and he gave it to me, just like that.  No questions asked.  Although he knew it was for the gifts, he made no comment about how expensive this was going to be, just a \"here is the money go get it done\".  I felt so guilty taking such a big chunk of our spending money and I know we will have very little to spend until the 1st but this was really important to me (mostly because my friends were super generous to me when I was there in Japan this past fall).  So in short I am thankful for the hubby's generosity and how supportive he is of what is important to me."},
{"title": "A Pre-Christmas Update", "date": "Wednesday, December 21, 2011", "text": "It's kind of crazy around here...The cousin will have about 12-15 family members come to Las Vegas for Christmas so we volunteered to help her out by cooking a meal for them each day for the next week.  Actually hubby will cook and I will bake something each evening so tonight hubby will cook a beef stew type dish (in the Philippines it is called apritada and since everyone is Filipino they should like it) and I will bake brownies.  The cousins have helped us out a lot over the past couple months so this is a good way to give back.  Also, hubby loves to have people to cook for and I love to bake but don't want and entire giant batch of brownies or cookies just sitting on the counter where I will make a meal of them, plus this will save the cousin a considerable amount of money since in the past she would just take the whole group out for each meal(!).I am determined to get Christmas gifts sent off to my friends in Japan by tomorrow.  I feel so bad that they won't arrive until New Years but I have kept putting it off (mostly because of the cost but also because we have been busy), however I don't want them to arrive in spring so I better get busy!I was going to get hubby a smart phone for Christmas which would have cost $200 for the phone then an added $20 each month for the calling plan (his plan now is $30 but for phones that use a lot of data the plan costs $50), but he said he doesn't really want one so now I need to figure out something else to get him (but I am secretly breathing a sigh of relief that our monthly cell bill won't increase!).We seem to be chronically frugal now.  We needed a butter dish so we looked at one at Walmart and it was $4 and we both agreed that that was too expensive (!?) so we waited a couple of days and found one at the Dollar Store for, well, a dollar.  We have never been this frugal before but since we have been traveling and living on a really small income, we question each and every purchase no matter how small it is dollar-wise. Yikes.I have been listening to Dave Ramsey on the radio a lot lately, mostly because his show comes on about the time we cook dinner so it is something nice to listen to while we cook.  I can't recommend listening to his show enough for people who want to get out of debt--or even for those of us who are out of debt, so we don't go back to our old ways.That's about all that is happening today.  I hope all of you are getting ready for a wonderful Christmas!"},
{"title": "My New Year's Resolutions and My New Monthly Budget", "date": "Tuesday, December 20, 2011", "text": "I have been thinking about New Year's Resolutions lately.  Actually I was wondering if I should make any at all because I am notoriously bad at keeping them but there is something about a new, bright and shiny year that makes one want to throw themselves full force into self improvement.  So in the interest of improving myself (for however short a span it lasts), here's my new year's resolutions and my new monthly budget:Earn a black belt in karate.  I have dabbled in karate off and on over the years but I really want to focus on earning a black belt.  There is a karate school that I will check out tomorrow and while the price is around $100 per month, I noticed that their website is really old looking so maybe I can trade a few months of lessons for an updated website.Finish writing a book and get it published.  This has been on my list for ages but this is the year that I actually have time to focus on and complete this goal so I am going to give it a shot (and should it be successful, will add some funds to my meager savings).Add $100 to my emergency fund each month.  My emergency fund is currently on life support so any amount I can add each month would be helpful; hopefully with some freelance writing gigs I can deposit at least $100 a month.Go to Asia in the fall.  Last fall's trip to Japan and the Philippines was amazing and I realized that everyone we know there is getting older so it seems like it is better to go there as often as possible now while the people we know are still around.  This is going to take some major savings/work effort because we spent a boatload of money on our last trip!Work on our family genealogy, going directly back as far as possible.  Genealogy has only recently peaked my interest but it is so fascinating that I want to make time to do a complete and thorough research job so this will definitely be something I focus on during the upcoming year.Go to Europe next fall.  For some reason we always go to Asia but never to Europe.  The bit of genealogy research I have done has highlighted a couple of places in the UK where there is a heavy concentration of my ancestors so going there would have two benefits, the first, being to add some research to my family tree, and the second, to be able to enjoy traveling there while the hubby is still able to easily get around.Be fluent in Japanese.  Although I barely got to practice what Japanese I learned over last summer when I went to Japan, I still have two college textbooks on basic Japanese that I want to complete in full--mostly because I love learning new languages.Be fluent in Spanish.  Again, I would like to brush up on my Spanish language skills although I don't speak it here nearly as much as I used to when I was working in my non profit.  I would like to complete the entire \"Practice Makes Perfect\" Spanish series.Do some sort of physical challenge.  I haven't quite decided what that will be but the options I have been considering include biking from Canada to Mexico, doing the Warrior Challenge or Tough Mudder, or something to that affect.  I am stating the goal this way because I usually just put \"be healthy and fit\" on my list and that is too generic a thing to accomplish so with a specific physical fitness goal, I am hoping that it will make me concentrate on physical fitness enough to actually reach this goal.Take the family on a reunion cruise.  We used to have family reunions somewhere in the US at some family member's house but with an extended family of more than 100 people and growing, the logistics of this were just too overwhelming.  About five years ago we decided to hold the family reunion on a cruise ship and it was wonderful.  There were people to cook and clean for us, everyone was free to go do what they wanted yet we all met up for dinner each night, and most importantly, the family still talks about the cruise to this day so the memories made were pretty impressive.  The way we do this is that each \"parent\" in the family (meaning hubby and his brother and sisters) usually pays for all of their kids and grand kids to go on the trip because the kids and grand kids are at a point in their lives where they don't have the money to spare to pull this off.  This means that for just the hubby and I, we will need to pay for 17(!) people to go.  Without me working this is going to be a super difficult thing to do because we are talking about nearly $10,000(!).  So while this is on the list, it is probably the lowest priority just because it seems so out of reach yet I will still keep it on the list because for some odd reason, nearly everything I put on my \"wish list\" seem to work out some how.So with these goals in mind, my monthly budget starting January 1st is...Tithe $50 (I tithe every month to Unity)Cell phones $80 ($50 for mine and $30 for hubby's)Savings $100 (this will go into my emergency fund)Grandson's school $40 (I have paid for his school since kindergarten and want to do this through college)Electric bill $50+/- (hubby pays all of the bills but I would like to be able to help him out by paying at least one of our bills so that would be the electric bill.  In the winter the bill is low but I am a little afraid to see what the summer bills will be when we have the AC going 24/7)Karate $100 (I hope to offset this by bartering if possible)With this budget in mind, I need to some how earn around $500 a month.  It seems like such a piddly amount but as my last month's money challenge showed me, even earning this little bit takes a lot of effort!"},
{"title": "Yesterday I Gave Myself and Early Christmas Present...Oh, And Here's Some Penguins", "date": "Monday, December 19, 2011", "text": "First, the penguins.  We went to the Bellagio today because I had heard that their new Christmas display was up and this always makes a nice, free photo op.And my Christmas present....  These past few days, as I have been lamenting how far behind I am this holiday season (like I haven't even STARTED Christmas shopping yet!), I was thinking about how I can simplify my life even more so that in 2012, I will have time to work on some big projects I have been thinking about doing.  Then it hit me that at this time, when I have absolutely nothing pressing to do since I currently don't need to work (and if we can stay super frugal I can continue this way until something I just can't resist comes along), I need to stop doing \"day filler\" stuff and actually focus on things with some long term benefits (I should have these things together in list form by tomorrow).The first thing I did was make me a new website which you can find here, then I decided to stop \"blogging for dollars\" so to speak and focus more on freelance writing to bring in a bit of funds on the side.  At first, since I love to write, I thought that setting up some \"niche\" blogs would be a good way to earn some Adsense revenue but it really isn't and keeping up seven blogs takes A LOT of time.  So as you can see, down in the right corner of this page, I am signing off from all of the newer blogs I have started and will only have three to update each day--this one (which is my most personal blog), another blog which I am just putting together that I will use as a \"grab bag\" for business and tech and travel stuff (less personal; the one I direct my friends, family, and clients to), and a third blog which I ghost write (a long story).I feel more relaxed already!"},
{"title": "One Year Into Our New Lifestyle and Here's What I Have Learned", "date": "Sunday, December 18, 2011", "text": "It just dawned on me that in a couple of weeks it will be exactly one year since I quit working (actually I am still doing some freelance stuff but on December 31st of last year I \"fired\" my biggest client which basically left me jobless).  Here's what I have learned:You can drop from an income of $6000-$8000 a month to $2000 a month (for two people!) and still be extremely happy.  We are at least.The biggest change you need to make is in your attitude.  I am a bit embarrassed to say that around five years ago I was one of those snooty people who would look down on people who took the bus, drove clattering cars, and wore last season anything.  Now I take the bus, drive a car that is more than ten years old, and wear clothes from the Goodwill.  What a difference a few years (and a growth in maturity) makes!If you look at a financial challenge like a shot to your ego and try to get things back \"to the way they used to be\" then you will miss the lesson (and the adventure) that comes from massive change.  Instead, if you look at a financial challenge like a riddle or a game, you can be creative and audacious and turn the problem into a fun experiment then come out on the other end with something really amazing that in your \"old life\" would have never even been a possibility.There are only a few things that you really NEED to have a happy life (and none of these needs have a designer label on them).  Prior to our year of travel, I thought that I NEEDED a big house, a nice car, designer clothes/shoes/purses, lots of cash to give gifts to people with, shopping and lunching with the girls, etc.  During our year of travel, the only things that we really NEEDED were: a clean, dry, safe place to sleep (thanks to generous friends and relatives we got this FREE for an entire year); a few changes of clothes (we wore the same clothes--and only what would fit in our backpacks--for a year and no one even noticed that we only had about five changes of clothes each); food (yes, you can survive on $1 tacos and burgers for an extended period but I don't recommend it.  When it comes to food, the 99 cents store rocks!); and a bit of socialization (the hubby and the internet--you guys who comment on this blog--and friends on FaceBook and Twitter took care of that).  Everything else is free--sunshine, fresh air, a nice walk, the library, etc.There is always a cheaper way to do things.  Again, a few years back, I thought that having a lifestyle where we would spend nearly $8000 a month (!) on everything from big house and car payments to 150+ cable channels, the highest speed internet, restaurant meals a couple of times a day, magazine subscriptions...et al. was how everyone lived.  I've since learned that it's not.  Cell phone--$30 prepaid plan. Transportation--$50 a month bus pass.  TV--$20 for a one time purchase of a TV antenna.  Car insurance--liability only because the car is so old.  You get the idea...And the very best thing: once you set yourself on a changing path, people from your past who were part of \"that other\" lifestyle kind of disappear and new people, amazing people, people who are on the same journey as you start to appear.  Like you all who are reading this.  Again, it suddenly dawned on me that the people who filled my life a few short years ago (the ones who got together to talk about their new cars and their latest purchases) have all but disappeared.  Now most of our friends are kind of like us.  Many are retired or working only part time so they have a lot of free time to have potlucks and volunteer and meet for coffee.  When we get together we talk about how to save money on various things and where the best deals are to be found.  It doesn't matter what a persons' job title is or what kind of car they drive because they are there for you when you need them and they are genuinely nice people.Overall I wouldn't trade this experience for anything.  Now I get to sleep in as late as I want, there is absolutely no stress in my life, the is no office politics in my life (truly a welcome relief), we won't be having a fancy restaurant meal any time soon but cooking at home is so enjoyable that I don't care, finding a super bargain (like my J Jill jeans!) at the Goodwill is cause for celebration, saying hi to the regulars at the library where I do all of my online work is one of the highlights of my day, and spending a lot of time with the hubby is wonderful (because he is my best friend and who doesn't want to spend time with their best friend?).  Yes, we have to be careful with every dollar we spend and yes there are occasions when I wish we had a lot of money coming in (like now around Christmas time) but overall, having a life of freedom instead of debt payments and a job reminiscent of indentured servitude is sooooo much better."},
{"title": "Home Sweet One Bedroom Condo", "date": "Saturday, December 17, 2011", "text": "We are finally settled into our new place and EVERYTHING has been put away!  Here's a picture of the living room.  It's a small, one bedroom, one bath place but it is the perfect size for us.  In fact, we have decided to buy a two bedroom house instead of a three or four bedroom house as we had planned (actually that was our initial plan when we sold our last house--downsize and minimize so that we would save money on not only heating a cooling but also on decorating and furniture).  Like many times before, when we were making offers on houses here in Las Vegas we kind of got carried away with the \"if two bedrooms are good than three or four would be better\" thing so I am glad we put our home buying on hold for a few months so we could have a bit of time to realize that we want to spend a lot less money and time on a house so that we will have a lot more money and time to do the things we want to do like travel.  Anyway, I am really happy with this little place (except for the part about sharing a bathroom and closet with the hubby--definitely need two bathrooms and two separate closets in the new place!), the price is super reasonable, and it will be \"home\" for a few months for us!  Also, I have been cooking up a storm for the first time in nearly a year.  So far I have made pizza, banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, granola, yogurt, and curried shrimp with rice.The only thing that is missing is a Christmas tree but real trees are SO expensive here!!!  So we will hang up some Christmas cards and call it good for this year.  Now I need to get my Christmas shopping done!!!"},
{"title": "Finally All Moved In...I Love the 99 Cent Store...and My Articles...In Other Words, A Rambling Update", "date": "Thursday, December 15, 2011", "text": "Here's kind of a rambling update (mostly because of the copious amounts of caffeine I've had today thanks to a big Basking Robbins Cappuccino Blast--my favorite!)...We are finally all moved into our condo, furniture is moved, boxes are unpacked, and it really is home now (I'll post some pictures of it tomorrow, it was kind of still messy today so I didn't want to take pictures).  The exercise from moving furniture and boxes was great (after the first day or so of feeling like I had been run over by a truck).  I'm trying to think of a way to keep up that kind of walking/lifting type of exercise in the future...I've gotta say, I absolutely LOVE the 99 Cent stores here.  They are kind of like Dollar Stores but have way more stuff like food and fresh fruits and vegetables and are as big as a supermarket.  Every time we make a list of things we need for our new place (aluminum foil, bath mat, spices, etc) we hit this store first before all others and so far have mostly been able to stock our new place with the things we have found there (which saves us a LOT of money over buying these things at other places such as Walmart).A couple of my articles from last month's money challenge have been published (which...yeah!...means I can now invoice for them).  You can check them out here and here.Finally, I caught just a short segment on talk radio today which was really interesting (and scary).  There was a guy on (didn't catch his name) who was talking about the federal budget and federal deficit and simplified the numbers by knocking off six zeros from all figures because, as he said, when you talk about trillions and billions of dollars people's eyes glaze over. Any way, he noted that the government is like a person who earns $21,000 a year yet spends $36,000 a year.  Every year.  Which is why the US is in so much debt.  Can you image if you earned $21,000 a year but spent $36,000 a year by going into debt what kind of shape your finances would be in after a decade? Yep.  Scary.  That's the kind of shape the US is in financially now.Also, I am updating ChimeIn a lot now.  You can find me there at http://chime.in/user/aprilborbonAnd finally (again), while we haven't decorated at all for Christmas this year, I thought I would post a picture of our Christmas tree from a couple of years ago just because my blog seriously lacks pictures and it is the holiday season and for some reason I am so not in the holiday spirit this year--I think because it is so sunny and warm here while all of our Christmases in the past have featured gloomy, overcast Seattle skies, cold weather, and occasionally snow.  I just don't equate Christmas time with sun yet.Note to self--CUT BACK ON THE CAFFEINE!"},
{"title": "It Works!", "date": "Tuesday, December 13, 2011", "text": "That's what hubby and I both said as soon as we plugged our TV into the digital antenna.  We couldn't believe we could have TV without paying for cable but we figured out that it was actually possible...Well, first we moved our stuff in to our new rental condo.  Hubby HATES moving so I am betting that we will live in our next house until we die or something because we are too cheap to hire someone to move our stuff and too weak to easily move our stuff ourselves (but we do it anyway and it takes forever and we both feel like we have gone ten rounds with Mike Tyson...).Then we set up our TVs and debated our TV options.  Cable was expensive ($90 a month intro fee for cable TV, phone, and internet then after six months it jumps up to $150+) and even getting just cable TV and internet would set us back over $80 a month so I did a bit of research and found that if you buy a digital TV antenna, you can catch over the air HDTV signals so we bought the antenna ($20 at Walmart) and plugged it into the TV and we were able to pick up about 40 stations.  It's kind of an odd array of stations but it is TV and it covers most of what we usually watch (ABC, CBS, NBC).  Then, just as I was going to call the cable company and order internet only, the manager of the complex pointed out that there was free wifi there so needless to say hubby and I were elated.  Which makes our bills now:Rent $600Electricity $50+/- (unsure because we haven't received our first bill yet)Cell phones $80Storage $75 (the condo was furnished so we switched out our furniture and are now paying to store the cousins furniture in our storage unit)Tithe $50Medical insurance $35Car insurance $35Grandson's school and help for son's family in Philippines $100Of course we also have gas, food, clothing, misc. but we try to keep these expenses as low as possible.  I am just happy that we can now finally eat all of our meals \"at home\" now. Yeah!p.s. I officially got my Las Vegas driver's license today which was a whole experience in itself.  I have never seen a DMV as big as the one in Las Vegas with 35 service stations and a two hour wait.  People everywhere, lines everywhere, and the lady that helped me said they weren't even busy that day!!!"},
{"title": "A Quick Update: The Moving Edition!", "date": "Friday, December 9, 2011", "text": "First, I have done nothing to earn money yet this month.  I was hoping to keep my project from last month going by at least making an effort to try and make money every day or every other day but like most good intentions, life stepped in and we have been busy with other stuff...like moving...We just signed the rental agreement for the cousin's condo this morning and she will be leaving on Sunday so we will start moving in Sunday afternoon.  We got a really good deal from the cousin--cheap rent (much less than she is actually paying for the mortgage and condo fees and even less than the market value....nice cousin!), no first last and deposit so we don't have to come up with a chunk of money right now (in fact she gave us the month of December free so we don't actually start paying rent until January...like I said, very nice cousin). So now that we have the rental agreement I was so excited to go and get a Las Vegas driver's license but no one warned me that the DMV in Las Vegas looks like Disney Land on Spring Break!  A two hour wait time, hundreds of people everywhere, and lines everywhere. Yikes!  I promptly left and next week, since we were going to go up north to the military base, we will try to find a smaller DMV from which to procure our licenses.Then I called to get the electricity in our name.  I had to wait on hold for twenty minutes just to talk to someone.  I asked if there is a better time to call if I need to talk to them and she said waiting only 20 minutes was a very quick hold time (?!).Then I called the cable company to find out about internet and cable TV.  They have a deal of $90 a month for six months for phone, internet and cable TV but we don't want a phone as we both have cell phones and we really don't need a million cable channels either.  What we want is cheap and they don't seem to have cheap so it looks like we will get cable only then buy an antenna and see what over-the-air digital stations we can get on our TV since we don't really watch much TV and when we feel like a movie we can just get them for free from the library.Finally...I can't wait to start cooking meals at home.  I am so tired of eating out--which we have been doing for about the last six months--that it wouldn't bother me if I don't see another restaurant for a year!  Guess I am just craving home cooked food!"},
{"title": "Once Again Google Saved Me a Bunch of Money", "date": "Tuesday, December 6, 2011", "text": "Here's a picture of hubby's computer looking hale and hearty.  Yesterday it was doing the death rattle.His computer has had viruses a couple of times before and with Google's help I was able to fix the problem (really simple actually...just restart the computer in safe mode then restore the computer to an earlier time).  This latest virus, however, was pretty tough. It wouldn't let me do anything to the computer--no clicking on icons, no restarting in safe mode...I basically thought the computer was dead OR that I would have to take it in to a computer shop to get it fixed.Then I did what I always do when I am having a crisis--I Googled the problem.  I Googled a rambling description of the problem (windows 2012 virus screen locked blah blah blah) and it quickly gave me a list of results about the virus and how to fix it.  I tried a recommendation from the first link and it didn't work so I did a bit more research and found that you can download a windows virus scanner onto a USB drive via another computer then put the USB drive into the sick computer and make it boot from the USB drive instead of the hard drive thus bypassing the virus.  After an hour and a half of scanning the computer then coming up with the virus which it allowed me to \"kill\", the computer came back to life.  I then did a Windows update, uninstalled the old virus software, then installed new, free virus software (Avast) and now all is well and hubby is happy to get his computer back!  I'm just happy we didn't have to spend the money to have a professional fix it.tl;dr  If you have any kind of problem, Google first before you panic.  With the millions and millions and millions of people in the world it is a good bet someone has had a similar problem and posted a way to fix the problem online.  Yeah Google!"},

We spent Exactly $0 on our Trip!", "date": "Monday, December 5, 2011", "text": "The hubby and I were kind of stressing out about our recent trip to Tennessee for the SIL's wedding.  Usually any travel results in us spending a goodly amount of money.  Fortunately, after we paid for our tickets to get there (around $550) we ended up not having to spend a penny more on the trip!We got a ride to the airport from the cousin so that was free.  When we got to Tennessee, we were picked up from the airport by my husband's daughter who had arrived before us so we didn't have to rent a car.  We stayed in a huge, beautiful cabin that the SIL rented to house everyone (there were about 25 people there total and the cabin could sleep 30 people--it was huge and beautiful and perched right on top of a mountain looking out over the Smoky Mountains).  The wedding couple also brought a ton of snacks and beverages and for the evening of everyone's arrival they bought pizza for dinner.  We didn't need to buy special clothes for the wedding because it was casual (it was an outdoor wedding at a mountain top chapel--the view was AMAZING!).  After the wedding, they had a huge barbecue lunch catered and it was brought right up to the cabin.  We ended up eating this huge spread for the rest of the day (BTW the people in Tennessee can REALLY cook!).  The rest of the day everyone hung out at the cabin (the closest town was miles and miles away so there was no temptation to go hang out in town and spend money).  Then the next day we left--again a ride to the airport with the step daughter and we took some of the snacks with us to eat on the plane.  Pick up at the airport was free from the cousin, and we ended up back home having spent exactly 0 for the entire long weekend!  Color me shocked...yet happy."},

But another SIL called and basically insisted that we went so we did (hubby has a very persuasive family!).I am really glad we came.  If we hadn't, we would have missed this beautiful sunset, we would have missed a beautiful wedding, and we would have missed the opportunity to meet up with some great people! So the moral of the story is that while it is a good thing to control your spending, don't pass up once in a lifetime opportunities just because you want to hold tight to your money."},

Yeah!  Our first place in nearly a year!I was so annoyed with The Palms poker room management today.  Hubby had purposely played there enough to qualify for a \"freeroll\" tournament and the tournament was supposed to be held today.  He was nearly guaranteed a minimum of $200 and if he did well, $1000.  Without warning the tournament was postponed (they couldn't find a room to hold the tournament in.  Really? In the entire huge casino?).  There have been some other wonky issues there too which just really annoyed me (and the many other players who came in today expecting to play in the tournament).  So hubby went to play at a different casino today and apparently so did ALL of the other poker players because when we went by in the afternoon and again in the evening on our way to dinner, there wasn't a soul playing there.  Serves them right!"},

Bummer.  I did get a great price on the camera (regularly $229, on sale for $129 then because I had to wait in line so long to pick it up, the nice guy at Best Buy gave me an extra $20 discount PLUS I will get a $10 Best Buy gift card in the mail for picking the camera up instead of having it mailed).  So I got the camera (plus a free 4mg memory card and free camera bag) for about $100 and it is supposed to be a really excellent camera (the camera I got just a couple of months ago doesn't really take clear pictures so I will send it to the son in the Philippines where he can use it or sell it if he wants to make some money).  The cell phone was an OK deal...at $199 it isn't a super sale price but I didn't need to get a two year contract for it either.  It is supposed to be a very good phone, and they seem to be sold out at Amazon and most of the Walmarts I checked (the Walmart I went to had this one hiding behind other phones).  I did have to go up from my $30 a month plan to the $50 a month unlimited plan so, financially speaking this wasn't such a great move, but sometimes I get the \"I WANT IT\" mentality...and hubby just rolls his eyes (at least hubby is happy with getting my old cell phone which is much better than the phone he was using...).  See, I can justify just about anything!"},

{"title": "5 Reasons I'm Glad We Put Off Buying a House in Las Vegas...And A Bundle of Interesting Links", "date": "Saturday, November 19, 2011", "text": "I was pondering our current housing situation and getting a bit excited at the fact that we will have our own place in a couple of weeks after nearly a year of wandering.  Then it dawned on me that everything happens for a reason and the reasons for us not buying a house as quickly as we intended are starting to pop up:I am really glad the first condo we made an offer on back in July fell through.  It is in the same development as the cousin's condo that we are currently staying in.  The realtor had us sign a waiver about airport noise but at the time we really didn't hear anything so I didn't think it was a big deal.  I asked the cousin about airport noise and she said she never heard anything (note that after spending a few months with her I have noticed that she is nearly deaf! As in she hardly ever hears me talk to her!).  And now approximately every three minutes between 6am and 10pm the house-rattling noise of airplanes taking off and landing are a constant source of irritation if we happen to be home.  Yikes!The second condo we made an offer on was nice but after having driven around the city on a daily basis, we have concluded that we are glad that that offer fell through as well since it really is quite a ways away from the places we always go to and it would have cost us a lot more in gas.And speaking of condos, I had never lived in an apartment before (actually I lived in one for a couple of months when I was in college but the building was mostly empty so I missed all of the things that go along with living in a condo/apartment) but now that we are staying in a condo (um, apartment...same thing) I have decided that we are definitely going to buy a house.  I don't like loud neighbors, the smell of people smoking below us on their deck, the wafting of cooking odors coming up every evening...basically I am picky and I like my privacy so a house it will be.We were watching the news a couple of nights ago and came across this story which was kind of shocking.  Apparently if you buy a repossessed house, due to a robo-signing problem, you may not actually own the house.  Holy cow!  This will definitely be something we look into before buying anything here.I'm still not sure if we want to be tied down with a mortgage.  I feel like there is still more traveling I want to do.  We will get a \"trial run\" so to speak when we rent the cousin's condo for about six months then decide from there what to do.So you see, things work out well after all even if you don't get what you originally thought you wanted.And here's a bunch of links from my favorites file:7 Habits of Highly Frugal People (that's me...at least I try to be!)10 Insanely Awesome Inspirational Manifestos (this site has been crashing all day but the manifestos are a great read so check back later if you can't get through now) Are you responsible for bailing out your financially irresponsible parents? (some food for thought)What I Learned from My Vision Board (I love vision boards!!)Family Search (I came across this site earlier and have been there all day--when I should be doing something for my money challenge!)"},
{"title": "Day 18 of My Money Challenge", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2011", "text": "Today I gambled!  It was on my list of ways to try to earn money and when hubby won a small poker tournament he gave me 10% ($20).  We were in the casino and although I hate gambling with my money since really, gambling is pretty much a losing game, I thought I would try a few hands of pai gow poker and see what would happen.  I started with $20, went up to $45 then dropped down to $30 at which point I quit before I lost everything.  So today I got $20 from the hubby and $10 from my gambling winnings.  I think this will be the one and only time I try gambling to win money because I am well aware that the odds are stacked in the casino's favor (except for poker which I don't play because it takes too long).As I'm sitting here in my new (to me) Levis that I got at the Goodwill yesterday, it hit me that there are quite a few things you can do with clothes to save money (food and clothing being the biggest controllable expenses in our budget).  Here's some ideas:I buy all identical sox.  I used to have a whole collection of sox. Short sox, long sox, pink sox, blue sox (sounds like the beginning of a children's book doesn't it...).  Now I buy all black, short sox of the same type and brand.  This way if I lose one sock, all of the rest will still match so I don't have to throw out the mate to the lost sock.I shop thrift stores for certain items: jeans, t shirts, and hoodies being staple items that I love to buy already warn (saves me from washing them 25 times to get the desired comfort level).I splurge on shoes, kind of.  I don't like cheap shoes--they are generally made of plastic instead of leather and don't wear very well.  I don't, however, pay full retail for them.  Usually I can find some great deals on Ecco, Privo, Keens, and other good brands at Ross and TJ Maxx.  Then I wear them forever.I don't have many clothes.  Pareto's Principal states that you wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time.  So I try to pare out the 80% and only keep the clothes that I find myself always wearing.  Which is much better than having a closet stuffed full of things you hardly ever wear.I mend and dye my clothes when necessary.  I have some friends who throw out clothes as soon as a seam starts to ravel.  It's easy enough to make small repairs to your favorite clothes so that you can keep on wearing them.  Ditto for redying clothes that are starting to look faded out (usually I throw all of my black clothes into the wash with a dye packet and they all come out looking like new), and using a bit of shoe polish on scuffed shoes.I buy simple clothes.  Unfortunately I won't (ever) be the trendy person but that's OK.  I generally only buy--and wear--basic staples such as jeans, slacks, t shirt, and sweaters.I tend to \"dress up\" with accessories.  On those (now rare) occasions when I need to dress up, I can change a plain black dress or slacks and a sweater to something more interesting with a nice scarf, cute earrings, nice heels, chunky bracelets, etc.I like hand-me-downs.  Years ago I wouldn't have been caught dead in a thrift store or, horrors, accepting hand-me-down clothing.  Now I let people know that if they are cleaning out their closets I would be happy to take their cast offs (generally I take what I like then donate the rest to the local thrift shop).You can get some pretty good basics at Walmart.  Again, back in the day, I would have NEVER shopped at Walmart or KMart but I have found some great basics (t shirts, tank tops, etc) at these stores.I ALWAYS shop the clearance racks.  I can't remember the last time I paid full retail for an item of clothing.  These days I head straight for the clearance racks of any store I go into.  Even better are the days when the store has 50% off clearance sales.  Heaven!When I shop for clothes I always pay with cash.  Even though I don't use credit cards, using debt cards is similar enough that I can be tempted to buy a little more than I want to spend, but handing over cold, hard cash for clothes makes me really stop and evaluate whether or not I need the extra items or not.Although I don't sew very well, I don't hesitate to buy deeply discounted clothes then add a few special touches to them myself (I've made capris out of trousers, make a long sleeved shirt into a short sleeved shirt, etc).  If it turns out badly, at least the clothes were so cheap to begin with that it won't bother me to toss them out.A good tailor can be your best friend.  Fortunately hubby is a pro at hemming pants (I am short so the pants I buy usually always need to be hemmed).  Also, as suit styles change over the years, hubby has had his suits altered at a local tailor to keep them looking at the height of style.I always check the tags on clothes that I buy and if it says linen or dry clean only I put it back on the rack immediately.  I never buy clothes that won't survive the washer/dryer test so that I won't have to pay each time I want them cleaned and have to take them to the dry cleaner.I try to always buy pieces that go together so I don't end up with a closet that looks like a rainbow.  Again, you won't find me at the height of fashion and I am sure my clothes look pretty bland (nearly everything is in black, brown, sage, and cream) but my clothes always look well put together because I am not trying to match a half dozen different colors.Sometimes I will even ask for discounts on discounted clothes.  If I find a clearance item that has a stain on it or a raveling seam, I always ask for an additional discount since I will have to fix the item myself before it is wearable.The judicious use of a stain lifter and iron will do wonders for your clothes.  Even if your clothes aren't the most fashionable, they will still look a lot better if they are clean, don't have holes, don't have stains, and are ironed (yes, I do iron every piece of clothing that I wear...every day.  People find this odd).I extend the seasonable-ness of my clothes.  For example, I wear my tank tops under sweaters in the fall and winter and my form-fitting capri jeans now fit well into my knee-high boots (people will never guess that these were the same capris I wore all summer as they look like regular-length jeans when stuffed into my boots).I shop maybe once or twice a month for clothes.  In years past, it was quite common that the girls and I would hit the mall on our lunch break (multiple times a week) in order to shop.  Needless to say you can spend A LOT of money when you shop nearly every day.Trade or borrow clothes if necessary.  Back when I had formal events to go to, I had a couple of nice formal gowns.  The secret to hitting a lot of formal events with only a couple of gowns is to borrow and lend your gowns to your friends so everyone always shows up in something \"new\" to them.Splurge on a couple of nice items.  Since I don't want to feel totally destitute and I do really love name brand items, I tend to splurge on a few name-brand items, namely Coach purses and North Face jackets (of course I buy these items on sale and at the outlet mall).I sign up for store promos when possible (ie: I gave Victoria Secret my email address and at least once a year I get a coupon for a free pair of undies).  I also use store coupons and rebates occasionally (but only if I can use the coupons or rebates on items that are already on sale).I don't buy cheap quality clothing.  I think most polyester and acrylic clothing should be banned but that is just me.  There is a lot of clothes you will run across at discount stores that will be cheaply made and made of cheap material.  I will happily spend a bit more to buy a cotton or wool sweater instead of an acrylic sweater.I avoid \"specialized\" clothes no matter how popular.  Unless you are a logger, you really don't need Carhartt clothing.  Unless you are a marathon runner, you really don't need a $100 running jacket that has everything but mechanical air conditioning.  Unless you are ascending Mt Everest, you really don't need a parka rated at -45 degrees.Some other ways to save money on clothes that I haven't tried: shopping online, shopping at garage sales, sewing my own clothes, shopping at consignment shops, buying clothes at military surplus stores, etc."},

And I love the Goodwill:I need some pants so yesterday I went to Ross but couldn't find anything.  There were a couple of pairs of pants that I liked but at more than $20 each, that was way too much.  So today the hubby and I went to the Goodwill and for a grand total of $20 I got two pairs of jeans (a pair of Levis and a pair of JJill jeans which are like $90 in their boutique stores!), two t shirts, a sweater and a zip up hoodie.  Hubby said I should shop there more often--first because it saves us a ton of money and second because he knows that whenever I buy new clothes I like to wash them a few times before I wear them (I don't like the feel of \"new\" clothes)."},

{"title": "10 Financial Moves to Make by the End of the Year", "date": "Sunday, November 13, 2011", "text": "I'm on a \"10 things\" kick this week so bear with me.  Here are ten financial moves you should make by the end of the year:Make any tax deductible donations that you can so you can claim this on your upcoming taxes (be sure to get receipts!).Organize all of the stuff that you will need to do your taxes in a couple of months (while I keep my business income and expenses on a spreadsheet on my computer, I put a big envelope on my desk to collect W2 forms and 1099 forms that will be sent to me over the next couple of months).Fully fund your IRA, Roth IRA, employer-match retirement plan, etc. by the end of the year.Make sure your emergency fund is fully funded as well.If you have any \"use or lose\" vacation time or HSA (health savings account) funds, etc., be sure to take full advantage and use up these things by the end of the year.Buy in advance.  After Thanksgiving there is usually a lot of holiday food on clearance which I stock up on the use for Christmas.  Ditto for after Christmas sales of clothes and other items which I stock up on to use for birthdays and other occasions that will be coming up after the beginning of the year.Make it a goal to pay off a small debt by the end of the year.  It may be difficult, what with Christmas coming up, but it will be great to start the new year off with one less debt.Look back at any major changes that have occurred over the past year and update accordingly (if you had a baby consider starting a college saving plan; if you got divorced, change your insurance beneficiary; if you got married, update your Will, etc).Review everything: your financial goals for the upcoming year, your credit reports (http://www.annualcreditreport.com/), your insurance coverages, your monthly bills (try to reduce or eliminate them if possible), your Will and Power of Attorney, etc.Set financial goals for next year.  Which debts do you want to pay off?  Do you want to start a side business?  Do you want to switch jobs or ask for a raise?  Ten solid financial goals that will help you increase your income or eliminate debt will go a long way towards making you debt free in the future.I was going to be lazy today and not do anything for my money challenge since it is Sunday but...I checked my email and Freelance Switch bought the article I just emailed them a couple of days ago.  That will be $50 when I invoice them after the article is published (it could take a few weeks for the article to be published; I will link to it here when it is published)I am updating all of my blogs and websites today (I've seen a slight overall bump in AdSense revenue since I have been posting more frequently, but I think that most of the increase is due to putting more ads on a couple of my websites)I will write another article for Freelance Switch today because I am so psyched from the email :)"},
{"title": "Day 12 of My Cash Only Challenge", "date": "Saturday, November 12, 2011", "text": "I didn't do much for my challenge today...I signed up to do surveys at Opinion Outpost which was rated well on this website.  I want to wait and do a couple of these surveys to see how they go before signing up for a bunch of other survey companies.  I should get my first survey within 24 to 48 hours.I am very list-y person.  When I used to work, I always had a \"to do\" list on hand and quite often, I would make \"to do\" lists for my clients as well.  It has always been my habit to write down not only the things I needed to do but also the things that I wanted as well.  I started doing this about the time I learned how to write and I fully believe that these lists helped propel me out of trailer-court poverty and into a pretty good life.Now, I look back at some of these lists and can't believe that basically everything I wrote down has actually come to pass (my business, my non profit, and our year of travel being some of the \"biggies\").  So I continue to write lists.  On these lists are the things I want and need regardless of the price; oddly enough, these lists are still being fulfilled even though I basically have no income!  Imagine that.  Even the big box of books and school supplies that we just sent to the Philippines was on my list, never mind the fact that I had no money to make it happen but--surprise--it got done anyway!  I don't know how it works, I only know that it does work.  Here is my most recent list:November tithe $50 (I tithe every month to Unity; it's a habit that I keep whether or not I am working)December tithe $50 (ditto)December cell phones $60 (I pay for both of our pre-paid cell phone plans each month)Web host bill $150 (once a year I get billed for hosting for my websites, this is coming up in December)House for hubby's son in PI $1000 (we are helping the hubby's son build a house in the Philippines piece by piece; this is for the roof and supports)Camera $200 (I need a new camera, my cheap new camera is terrible)Laptop $750 (I want a new, smaller laptop; I think a 14\" laptop would be optimal)NV PO Box $50 (right now I pay $170 a year for a remail service which is great when we travel as they send our mail to wherever we are, but now that we are going to be stationary in Las Vegas a regular PO box will work)NV driver's license $50 (as soon as we move next month and get our own address I will get a license here, I want to establish residency here so I can take some classes at the university at the in-state tuition rate eventually)Japan Christmas gifts $800 (everyone in Japan was so wonderful to me that I want to send the entire family some very nice gifts)Next year's school for the grandson in PI $480 (I pay for the grandson's school in the Philippines and it costs $40 per month; I like to put the entire year's fees aside at the beginning of the year so I won't have to think about it until next year)Clothes and shoes for me $200 (my clothes and shoes have been dragging around with me for a year, they are old and hideous and I want some new stuff!)That's the list so far.  I have absolutely no idea how all of these things will get paid for but I also have no doubt that they will...somehow."},

{"title": "Day 10 of My Money Challenge", "date": "Thursday, November 10, 2011", "text": "It is DAY TEN of my money challenge and I haven't made a SINGLE PENNY! Ayayay  But I keep chugging away anyway.  Here's what I did today:I updated my eLance profile with samples of my work.I got an email from Kickstarter saying they approved my project (yeah!) so now all I have to do is put the project together and post it on the site and the donations will roll in (um...at least I will keep my fingers crossed that they will!)A guy called about buying my netbook and said he will meet me tomorrow so hopefully that will bring in some cashI have been good about updating all of my blogs.  The hubby's cooking blog has got quite a few hits (I think due to my SIL who told all of her friends about it--they love it when hubby cooks so maybe they will try the recipes).  BTW, today's recipe is Sauteed Ginger and Curry Pork.  Hubby is amused that the first time in...ever...I am paying attention to his cooking, dutifully taking notes, and taking pictures too!Yesterday I posted about the need for each person to have their own emergency fund.  At the time I was thinking about each adult person in the family in case something happened to their SO and they needed some cash to get through the first few days or weeks after a crisis.  I'm beginning to think that everyone in the family should have an emergency fund because of what happened yesterday.Last night I was perusing reddit and came across this post.  When the kid first posted I was thinking that's odd, maybe it is a sick joke (there seem to be a lot of teenage boys on the site and sometimes they just like to get attention). Then I thought that maybe it could be true. Then when I read the follow up, I nearly fell off my chair! How horrible for a teenager to be watching the news and see their dad's car in a fatality accident. Then if you read further through the comments you see that not only did his dad really die on the way home from work yesterday but his mom had died a few years earlier. And his concern, among other things I'm sure, is what the family will do for money because they were broke and his dad was the only wage earner. That kind of tragedy makes me think of what kind of precautions should be taken in the event that something happens to both parents and there are kids in the house. Obviously putting $1000 in a savings account and giving access to it to a teenager is a bad idea but some sort of emergency fund should probably be established for your kids that they could somehow access in the event of an emergency. Just an idea..."},
{"title": "Day 9 of My Money Challenge", "date": "Wednesday, November 9, 2011", "text": "I've been typing away like a maniac today (remember, I want to be a writer when I grow up!) so here is what I have done towards my money challenge:I wrote and submitted an article to the Dollar Stretcher (which pays by the word, usually around $70, if the article is accepted)I wrote and submitted an article to Freelance Switch (which pays a flat $50 if the article is accepted)I updated all of my blogs (I also broke out my blogs from my regular blog list so now you will find my updated blog posts at the bottom of the right sidebar)Also today we made a raid on the library and the 99 cent store to put together a \"balikbayan box\" to send to a school in the Philippines.  When we were in the Philippines we stopped by our grandson's school to visit and I was shocked to see that there were 50 kids in each classroom and very few resources for the kids (like no crayons, no books, etc).  The teachers asked if I could help so I told them I would send some books and school supplies.  Fortunately there is a shipping program in which you fill up a big box and for a flat rate of $70 they will deliver the box to any address in the Philippines.  I'm glad for the flat rate because I went to a bunch of libraries and bought a ton--at least it feels like a ton, I can't lift up the box now--of books for twenty-five and fifty cents then went to the dollar store and bought a bunch of school supplies.  We will mail the box tomorrow and it should arrive in about 45 days. Whew! The picture above is of our grandson's third grade class.I was reading Judy's blog yesterday when I saw this post and then it struck me....not only do you need a family emergency fund, but each person should have their own individual emergency fund as well.  For the hubby and I, our money has always been separate.  We each have our own separate bank accounts and we each have small emergency funds (around $1000 each) as well as another account where the bulk of our savings goes which we use for travel and larger purchases.I have seen it happen far too often where life is going along swimmingly and suddenly one spouse is blindsided by the other and then not only is that person tossed into the throes of crisis, but they are often left without money to boot.  This happened to one friend when out of the the blue her husband called and said he was moving out and they would be getting a divorce.  I mean, they had been married for almost 25 years and she had no clue that he was even thinking of such a thing.  Another friend had been married for many years and everything was going well, she and her husband even had a cruise booked, and then he died suddenly.  Yet another friend had been living with a guy for nearly a year, he was even paying most of the household bills, and then one day he called her from jail saying he had been arrested for outstanding warrants he had from another state.  There went her boyfriend AND the income he was providing towards their household expenses.  Those are all horrible scenarios yet they happen in real life all the time.Mostly it seems like these things happen to women, but they can happen to men as well so everyone needs to keep their own private stash of cash to use in an emergency.  When you are in the middle of an immediate crisis that you had no idea was about to happen, the last thing you want to do is to have to scrounge under the couch cushions to try to gather enough money to feed your kids that evening.Here's some guidelines:I don't think your personal emergency fund should be a secret from your SO.  In fact you should encourage them to put together their own personal emergency fund as well.  Hopefully you will never have to use it because your SO called to say they want a divorce or their girlfriend just showed up on your door step, but there are many other life-altering events that could happen such as your SO suddenly dying or being in a major car wreck which leaves them in the ICU for days or weeks on end.  By having your own emergency fund and knowing that your SO has theirs, both of you will still have the money to function in the midst of a crisis.I don't think your SO should be able to access these funds and vice versa.  Too many times, whether because of greed or just because one partner was pissed off, I have seen people who thought they had an emergency fund go to the bank and find out that their SO had cleaned out their entire account and left them penniless.  Obviously, in the event of one spouse's death, the other spouse would be able to access these funds eventually but while you are both alive and kicking, the money in your private emergency fund should be all yours so that you can rely on it being there in an emergency.I don't think the fund should be huge.  One or two thousand dollars in each person's fund should be fine.  Ideally you would only need to use these funds for the first week or so of a major crisis at which point you will have had time to come to some sort of terms with your SO or have the power of attorney invoked so that you will be able to access/use your joint funds. I think that if one spouse feels that they need $10,000 in their own fund, then there are probably some pretty big issues in the marriage and maybe that money should go for a marriage counselor or something.So that is my take on the whole emergency fund thing.  I really don't think of separate emergency funds as \"I'm getting ready to leave you or for you to leave me\" funds but rather a cushion that both spouses have to protect them during a crisis.  I am confident knowing that my private fund is waiting for me if I need it and I am equally confident that should the hubby have a crisis (maybe I become the one who is incapacitated or something), he will have the cash on hand to respond to an emergency with or without me."},
{"title": "Day 8 of My Money Challenge", "date": "Tuesday, November 8, 2011", "text": "I'm feeling very non-productive.  But at least with this challenge I need to so something each day in my efforts to make some money.  This is what I did:I reposted the ads for my laptop and netbook on CraigsList and lowered the prices on each so hopefully they will sell.I submitted a proposal for a Kickstarter project for the non-fiction book I want to write.  I could just write it and try to sell it to a publisher but I think if I know that the funding is there to self-publish, I will be more motivated to write it and get it to market ASAP.I have been making a concerted effort since the beginning of the month to keep up the blog posts on all of my blogs (seven blogs in all!) as well as linking the posts through FaceBook and Twitter so that more people will read the posts and thus generate more ad revenue (ie: more micro-fractions of a cent for each page view but oh well....).That's all for today.  If I have time tonight I will finish up another article for Dollar Stretcher so I can submit it tomorrow.  I've decided that I want to be a writer when I grow up.First, some links you might find useful (I found most of these when looking for ways to make some extra money this month):12 Ways to Earn Extra Money Online9 Great Alternatives to Google AdSenseA List of 'Get Paid to Take Surveys' SitesMoola Days 'Make Money' Posts40+ Passive and Extra Income Ideas to Help You Earn More MoneyAnd some non-money-making-related links:Dave Ramsey The Truth About Car Payments20+ Awesome Travel Jobs and How to Get ThemAnd an update:I have made exactly zero dollars with my money challenge to date.  That's the problem with writing-you will (probably) get paid, just not any time soon.We decided not to go to the SIL's wedding.  Although hubby would really like to be there, the cost of around $1000 for a three day event (airfare, car rental, etc) is just too much for us to spend right now.  He actually pointed out that $1000 would pay all of our bills for an entire month and asked if we want to blow it on three days of fun.  We both decided that the answer to that was 'no'.We did decide to take the cousin up on her offer and rent her condo in Las Vegas until we buy and move into a house here.  She is very generously offering us her condo for $600 a month (about $150 under the regular rental price).  We would only need to pay for electricity, as water, garbage, and sewer is included in the rent.  We would also need to pay for cable TV and internet if we want that (still up in the air if we can live without it).  Even though the other cousin that we are currently staying with said we can stay with her (for the next SEVEN months or so) we decided against that.  It would save us money but she only has a two bedroom condo and we feel like we are \"in her space\" so to speak.  It will be nice having our own place once again!I didn't call the mortgage company and try to get our late payment issue resolved as one commenter suggested.  If I was in a hurry to buy here I may have done that but, oddly enough, I am all of the sudden not in so much of a hurry to buy in Las Vegas.  After being here for a month there are some things I definitely don't like about the city so I think the forced wait will give us more time to evaluate if this is really the place we want to stay.I just added my Twitter feed over there...>>>>>   I am as bad as the kids...everything I do these days I feel the need to tweet about it.  Plus I have Twitter linked to my FaceBook page so they both get updated at the same time which saves some extra typing."},
{"title": "How the Public Library Can Save You $200 Per Month", "date": "Monday, November 7, 2011", "text": "So I don't bore you to death with only daily money challenge updates for the entire month, here is an article that I sent to the Dollar Stretcher--as part of my money challenge--but unfortunately they had already run similar articles so didn't need this one.  I am fortunate to live in an area with a pretty good library system. In fact, I recently added up how much money using the library could save an average family each month and I was shocked to discover that in round numbers, a family could save over $200 a month simply by using the free resources that the library provides. Here’s how:• Internet service. Since the library is close to my house and I am there nearly every day, I have decided to go without cable internet and just use the free internet provided by the library. This saves me around $50 a month over the cost of signing up for internet with the cable company (a bit more actually when you count the cost of a modem and router that most people have to purchase in order to access the internet that comes into their home). It might seem odd not to have internet available 24/7 but I do have internet on my cell phone which I can use if necessary and by not having internet at home, I am not tempted to waste my time online. In fact, I have found myself reading more books and doing more hobby activities than ever before because of this change. Savings: $50 a month.• Books. Of course books are the main reason that most people go to the library but when I used to hang out at Barnes and Noble a lot, I was always tempted--and often gave in to this temptation--to buy books that I ended up reading only once after which they just gathered dust on the books shelf. Now I never buy books and instead check out books from the library so that I always have more than enough to read. Savings: $25 a month on average plus the savings of the book store membership fee which is $25 a year.• Magazines and newspapers. Although I am sad to see that the paper form of the newspaper is slowly going the way of the dinosaur, it is just way more convenient for me to peruse the local newspaper either online at the library, or in paper form at the library, both of which are free. Also, the pile of magazines that I used to subscribe to can be read for free at the library which saves me a lot of money in annual subscriptions each year. Savings: about $20 a month (based on a newspaper subscription fee of $10 a month and $10 per month for nearly a dozen magazines which we used to subscribe to).• DVD rental. No longer do I need cable TV in order to watch movies or a Netflix membership. Our library has so many DVD movies which are free to check out that it may take years to get through them all. Savings: $50 for cable TV service or $14 for a monthly Netflix membership.• Music. Again, the library is a great resource for checking out music and they have recently instituted a free music sharing service which allows people to use their library card to download three free songs each week. Savings: at least the cost of one CD a month so about $10.• Child care. Although the library doesn’t officially offer child care, they offer a wide range of activities for pre-teen and teen kids on a weekly basis. If you drop your kids off for a couple of hours of classes each week, that could save money that you would otherwise be paying the babysitter. Savings: an estimated $20 for four hours of supervised activities for two kids.• Tutors and classes. Fortunately our library has a great online system to help kids of all ages with their school homework—for free. All you have to do is log on and ask your questions. For those who are just learning English, the library provides free English as a Second Language classes and free English tutors a couple of times each week. And, for seniors who are a bit leery of all of the new technology out there, the library offers free computer classes for seniors each week. Savings: at minimum $10 a week (it would be way more if you had to actually pay for a one-on-one English teacher or private tutor at home).• Family entertainment. There is plenty of entertainment options out there, unfortunately most of it comes with a pretty stiff price tag (have you taken a family of four to a first run movie lately???). At our library there is a wide range of activities—everything from knitting club to free movie nights to Wii bowling to a recent Comic Book Festival—all of which are provided free of charge to the public. Needless to say, all of these options provide lots of entertainment for the entire family. Savings: an estimated $20 a month.While there are a lot of fancier—read, more expensive--options available for learning and entertaining yourself, if you want to save money and still reap the benefits of movies, books, classes, and all sorts of free entertainment, check out your local community library.We were busy running around today so I didn't do much with my money challenge.  Currently, besides the money challenge, I am getting a big box of books and school supplies together to send to a very poor school in the Philippines.  It is also my friend in Japan's birthday coming up so today I got her a present and mailed it to her (a Coach purse from the outlet store which I got an additional 30% off on but still... I am shopping like I actually have money and I don't!.  But she was so generous with me when I was in Japan it seems like the least I can do--she really does like Coach).  Here's what I did today:I submitted a bid for a job on eLance (it was for writing a 400 word article so I bid $40).  I need to do my profile since I just set up my account yesterday then got on and bid for the job this morning.  If they look at my profile they will see nothing! Yikes.I checked my AdSense revenue and it looks like I am making much more (about double) than I was before.  I think it was from the extra ads I put on my other website.I am blogging like a manic.  I added a recipe to the Filipino Cook blog and I am also doing the 30 Days of Indie Travel challenge over at my Travel Blog.I still want to sell bottled water on the Las Vegas Strip as I think that would be a quick way to earn some money but it has been freezing cold here for the past couple of days (and no one told me it got so cold in Vegas!! eekkk).  So this idea will have to wait.And a few other things:  I think I \"just\" want to be a writer.  That is what I love to do.  Hubby said I could get a job waitressing--they seem to make $30 to $50 an hour in the busier casinos.  And I don't mind waitressing, in fact that is how I put myself through college, it's just that they wear the skimpiest uniforms and to stuff my body into what amounts to a negligee would be truly frightening (for me and the customers!)."},

Whew.  It's hard asking for money sometimes!I signed up for EJury.  This is similar to the online mock jury service I signed up with yesterday and it doesn't pay as much but both services sound like a really interesting way to make some money.I wrote an article and submitted it to Dollar Stretcher.  I have sold articles to them in the past so hopefully they will buy this one as well (it usually takes a few months for them to publish it and pay however)."},
{"title": "Day 2 of My Money Challenge", "date": "Wednesday, November 2, 2011", "text": "Here's what I did today for my money challenge:I totally remade one of my websites that gets the most visitors (1000+ per day).  Now instead of each page having one small Adsense ad on it, each of the pages has two Adsense blocks, one PayPal \"donate\" button, and an Amazon box where people can order right from the site and I will get a percentage of their purchases via the AdSense affiliates program.  I came across this link with ideas for adding additional ad services to my site but haven't tried any of them yet.I signed up for Trial Juries which is an online \"mock trial\" system that provides real lawyers with online \"jurors\" who will review their cases.  If they choose you for a case, it says it will take about an hour to review the case and after you provide feedback you will get paid $30.  Sounds like fun! I hope they choose me!Overall not much for the day but remaking the website took hours.  I'm glad it is finished!"},
{"title": "Day 1 of My Money Challenge", "date": "Tuesday, November 1, 2011", "text": "My challenge this month is to do something every day to try to earn a total of $1000 during the month of November.  Here's what I did today:We stopped and paid for our monthly rent at the storage shed place today and I talked to the lady at the desk and told her that I live really close by and if she has any customers who need help loading or unloading their storage shed to give me a call.  I left her my name and number and hope people will call. Not only is it good exercise but I can make some money too!I applied online to work at the Thomas and Mack Center.  This is the stadium at UNLV and it is an on-call/part-time job working in the ticket or concession stands.  Again, another simple way to make money yet I am not tied down to a 9-5 job.Also at the storage shed I dug my old laptop and old netbook out and posted them both on Craigslist.  I hope they sell!!!Today NaNoWRiMo begins.  While I probably won't complete my novel this month, I plan to work on it a bit each evening.Today I am working on one of my most visited websites.  It makes OK money from Adsense but I am redoing the entire site so it will look better and I will also put a better array of ads on it so hopefully it will make even more money!And some free stuff:One of hubby's cousins took us to Famous Dave's for lunch--her treat--which was a nice surprise. An even better surprise was that after lunch the manager of the restaurant gave us scratch off tickets and both hubby and I won two free entrees next time we go there.  I love barbecue (I just don't like to pay high restaurant prices to have it!).Hubby's sister in Atlanta told us to come to her place and stay as long as we want--free of charge.  Nice sister!  But hubby really likes it in Las Vegas so we will probably stay here.  It was a really nice offer, however. We decided we want to find an apartment in Las Vegas until we move into a house so we looked at some senior apartment options then at lunch, hubby's cousin offered us her condo for as long as we want it since she will be going back to her regular house in San Francisco next month.  We would have to pay $600 a month which is a good price (and it is less than she actually pays for this condo each month as she bought it when prices in Las Vegas were sky high).  We told her that we want her to rent it out so she could get a better price for it to at least cover her expenses but she said it would be fine because she may want to come back later in the summer and didn't want the hassle of a regular tenant with a lease.  This may be the way we go until we get our house situation straightened out.  Plus just today she is getting all of the floors redone in a nice tile which is supposed to keep the place cooler in summer. Nice! So the running total of money earned this month is a big, fat 0...but hopefully the things I did today will lead to some earnings."},
{"title": "The House Hunting Saga Continues...And It Isn't Good News", "date": "Monday, October 31, 2011", "text": "This morning we met with our realtor to make an offer on house #6.  The fact that we had needed to make offers on six houses should have been a sign that we probably weren't supposed to buy a house right now.  Anyway, because she couldn't get a hold of our lender and get a pre-approval letter which needed to be submitted with the offer, our realtor suggested that we talk to their in-house lender and see if he could give us a pre-approval letter.After wading through our documents and crunching numbers and running a credit check he said he had good news and bad news.  The good news is that we are pre-qualified for \"however much we want\" according to him (around $250,000 based on our income) but the bad news is that we had a late payment on our mortgage in February and won't be able to get a mortgage loan until twelve months after that late payment.  That means we can't even make an offer on a house until MARCH!  Hubby is not happy. I'm not happy with the previous lender who should have known this.We figured out that the mortgage payment on our previous house showed up as late because it was due on February 1st but we thought that since the house was sold then and would close on the 9th, we didn't need to send the payment as the loan would be paid in full just a week later.  Wrong thinking however, as this showed up on our credit report as a late payment. AyayaySo hubby is irked as he is really tired of traveling and wants to buy a place and settle down immediately and I just feel sorry for our realtor who has shown us dozens of houses all for naught.  Surprisingly I am not angry or disappointed about having to wait.  Although I am not religious, I am pretty spiritual and figure that God puts us where we are supposed to be so if we aren't supposed to be in our own house until early summer then that's that.Now our options are wide open for four months.  We may choose to rent a place in Las Vegas or hubby's cousin said we can continue to stay with her as long as we want (free of charge which is a good price but I would feel like we are imposing if we end up staying there for seven months!) or we can go back to Atlanta for a few months or we can visit the family in Connecticut (that idea got a big fat NO from hubby who is decidedly averse to snow and cold) or we can go back to the Philippines for a few months (technically a cheap place to live however with a huge extended family there it can get downright expensive)...or? I guess we will need to decide something soon.  Ideally hubby would win a big poker tournament and we would be able to pay cash for a place but I'm not holding my breath on that one...I am also a bit relieved, however, that we are in a holding pattern.  With each house that we had made an offer on, the price kept rising as we were coming under the \"bigger is better\" and \"gotta have it now\" spell.  You may have experienced this as well...if a two bedroom, 1000 square foot home is good, then a three bedroom, 1400 square foot is better and it is \"just five thousand dollars more.\"  Unfortunately I have done this with cars a number of times (your basic $15,000 new car is nice but for $20,000 I can get this much better car) so before we know it we have exceeded our budget and bought something much bigger and more expensive than we wanted when we started out.  In fact, we had started our house buying journey with a $50,000 offer on a condo and were up to $90,000 on the last house. Yikes.  And even though we would qualify for a much bigger home loan, our goal when we started this process was to have a tiny house (so we wouldn't have to go back and buy all of the stuff we had sold at the beginning of the year to furnish it) and a tiny house payment (we are aiming for around $500 a month total, less than 20% of our income).  We have done the \"house payment takes nearly 60% of our income\" thing and that was stressful, stupid, and irresponsible...but I can see how people can easily fall into that trap if they keep seeing bigger and better houses.So now...we wait.Sorry about the long rant, I do feel much better now after writing all of this.Also, Happy Halloween!!!!  Be safe out there with your kids.Also (to prove that my luck isn't horrible horrible) just before I got to the library where I am writing this post there was a huge head on accident two cars ahead of me on the road.  This has happened to me a couple of times before and it is totally freaky.  I hope the people in the wreck are OK.  Life is very unpredictable."},
{"title": "I'm Psyched for My Money Challenge!", "date": "Saturday, October 29, 2011", "text": "Starting on Tuesday (November 1st) I have challenged myself to earn $1000 during the month of November.  This is what I have done as a way to get a jump start on my challenge:When I sent the monthly invoice to one of my clients for keeping her website updated, I mentioned that it was starting to look a little dated and for $200 I could update the layout so it would look more modern.  I haven't heard back yet but hopefully she will take me up on the offer.I browsed Kickstarter yesterday.  They let you do fundraising campaigns for all kinds of arts projects as well as for writing. I am amazed at how much money other people have been able to raise for their projects this way!  I may do a campaign for the non fiction book I want to write.I am trying to build up the courage to sell bottled water on the Las Vegas Strip next week.  The weather should be pretty warm and it seems fairly simple--we have a cooler and I can buy some ice and bottled water then make about $20 per case that I sell.  Hubby thinks I might get arrested.  I think I may die of embarrassment (I'm kind of shy and not the outgoing type of sales personality that would make someone successful at such an endeavour).I'm starting my money challenge with $40.  Hubby won about $800 at poker the other day and gave me $100 (which I think is more than fair as he has been paying all of the bills for nearly a year now).  I used $60 to pay for our cell phones for November (that is the only bill I pay each month) and now I have $40 left.  I think I will use this for the bottled water project then use the money I get from that project to buy pizzas to sell at the university.On a side note, also during the month of November, I am going to try to go all Paleo for a month.  My eating habits are now pretty atrocious and I can really feel the way all of the junk I have been eating is affecting my body so I need to try something else...like not having In N Out burger every other day. Yikes.That's all of now, I hope you all have a wonderful Halloween!!"},
{"title": "Eating Cheap in Las Vegas", "date": "Thursday, October 27, 2011", "text": "We've been coming to Las Vegas for more than 20 years.  I sorely miss the days when there was super cheap food on every corner.  These days Las Vegas food seems to have gone \"upscale\" with prices to match!  While I try to eat breakfast everyday at the cousin's house and hubby will occasionally cook dinner for all of the cousins so he will also have something to eat, I'm not much of a fan of Filipino food so we end up eating out for most of our lunch and dinner meals.  Here's what we have been eating:Del Taco has a three tacos for $1.09 on Tuesdays.  Their tacos are pretty good.Tacos Mexico is a local place which has amazingly good tacos, just like the kind you would find on a street corner in Mexico, for only $1.09 (see picture above).  They also have a condiment bar where you can get free radishes, cucumbers, and carrots so I make a little free salad out of these items to go with my meal.Popeye's Chicken has a two pieces of chicken for 99 cents special on Tuesday so we usually eat chicken on Tuesdays.El Pollo Loco has tacos similar to the Tacos Mexico tacos only in the chicken variety for $1.19 each so we eat there pretty often as well (good thing I like Mexican food!).My favorite fast food place is Wendy's where I get a salad, baked potato, and chili (and pour the chili over the baked potato) for about $3.50.Hubby loves the choices of Filipino restaurants here in Las Vegas.  His favorite is Ito'y Sariling Atin which offers a complete breakfast for $2.99 (rice, soup, egg, meat choice, and coffee).  I eat this too occasionally.Hubby and I will sometimes go to Subway for a $5 foot long which we split because a whole sandwich is too much for either of us.  I pile it up with every salad type item there is and we end up with a pretty balanced meal.We ALWAYS have water to drink with our meals no matter which restaurant we go to (it's free and healthier for us than soda).I love dim sum so occasionally we will go to the Cathay House at the Palms or Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast casino for dim sum (about $10 for three or four orders of dim sum).We found a wonderful $7.99 steak dinner at the Ellis Island Casino and Brewery.  For only $7.99 you get a soup or salad, rolls, a GOOD steak, steamed vegies, baked potato, and a glass or beer or root beer.  Definitely one of the best deals we have found so far for nights when we feel like splurging. Occasionally when we are tired of eating out we will go to the Super Walmart and put together a picnic as we walk through the grocery aisles and deli.Also occasionally we will feel like a burger so either hit up the dollar menu at Burger King or Jack in the Box or go to In and Out Burger which makes amazingly good (and cheap!) burgers.On a side note, I can't wait until I have my own kitchen to cook and bake in!!  Eating out is fine but it gets old after a while!"},
{"title": "50 Ways to Earn Extra Cash", "date": "Monday, October 24, 2011", "text": "Yesterday I was all fired up about my November \"Earn $1000\" challenge.  So I got right to work thinking of ways I could bring in that extra cash.  There are some things I can't do (sell my blood or eggs) and some things I won't do (anything illegal or immoral) but that still leaves lots of good ideas for bringing in a little extra money.  Here's my list:1. Write ten articles for Freelance Switch (I have written for them before; they pay $50 per article)2. Write ten articles for Dollar Stretcher (I have written for them before and made around $70 per article)3. Charge for nails site (I made a simple website for a business but haven't charged them since; I should at least charge them for the hosting fee)4. Put independent ads on one of my websites (I have a website that gets 1000+ visitors a day but I have yet to monetize it other than Adsense)5. Create a better web design and put more ads on one of my websites (Ditto)6. Do a kickstarter campaign (I still need to look into this to see if it would work)7. Monetize all blogs (I haven't done a very good job of this)8. Swap meet stall x 12 days (This would be expensive to get started and I don't know what my product would be)9. Help people at storage unit (I noticed when we were moving our stuff into the storage unit other people looked like they would need help moving stuff in and out; I may give my name and number to the lady that runs the facility and for $15 or $20 an hour I could help people that needed it there)10. Redesign NWR site (I may propose a website redesign to one of my clients and charge them, of course)11. Get percentage of donations for IAC (I could do some fundraising work for my former non profit and make a deal to keep a small percent of the money raised)12. Flyers to do immigration paperwork (I have done a lot of immigration paperwork in the past and thought about putting up flyers to help people apply for citizenship for a small charge)  (*I just found out that this is now illegal on the federal level as well as the state level.  Although I haven't done immigration forms since we started traveling last winter, it is too bad that people will now hove to pay exorbitant prices for attorneys to fill out simple USCIS forms for them!  http://blog.uscis.gov/2011/06/uscis-initiative-to-combat-unauthorized.html )13. Write novel and get it published or publish myself (I have a novel that is about 75% finished, if I get busy on it maybe I could get it published and make some money from it)14. Write ebook and sell online (I have considered writing an ebook to sell on the website that has 1000+ visitors a day as a way to help monetize the site)15. Sell bottled water (I read this idea somewhere and thought what better place to fill a cooler with bottled water and ice then walk down The Strip and sell it--it's hot out there and water is expensive on The Strip!)16. Do some craigslist gigs (I like doing short time gigs but I looked at the Vegas CraigsList gigs and most of it looked like porn stuff :0   )17. Be a Las Vegas tour guide (I could definitely pick people up from the airport and give them a quick tour of the area for a fee)18. Hold a sign on the corner and dance (I see these people holding signs for stores on the corner all the time and figured I could do that as well...but it is still kind of hot outside).19. Sell ad space on our car (I'm not sure if this is done here but in other places businesses pay people to put their advertising on their cars)20. Perform on the street (There are a lot of street performers in the Freemont area...and they seem to make money doing this...hmmm)21. Do online surveys (I have read numerous posts about doing this, I believe it isn't much per survey but you can make like $50 a day doing this)22. Online: elance, mechanical turk, demand studios, associated content (all of these places have simple freelance work that they may a minimal amount for)23. Niche blog on Filipino cooking (hubby is an excellent Filipino food cook; I may start a blog with videos posted on YouTube which could be monetized)24. 1000 places WA book/blog (A friend and I talked about doing a book/blog about Washington; we may still do this)25. Set up remail office/co-work space (I am fascinated with the co-work idea but it would cost a lot of money to get this going)26. Sell baked goods (I love to bake but I would need to find a commercial kitchen and a place to sell the items)27. Gamble (we are in Las Vegas after all and I am a pretty good pai gow player but of course income from this isn't guaranteed)28. Day trading (people do make money day trading but I'm not sure how well I would do with this)29. Make vanity websites30. Teach a class (on what I'm not sure)31. Computer set up (I am always the one people call to set up their new computers and/or fix their computer problems so I could probably do this for money)32. Las Vegas day trips (hubby and I like to go find new experiences around Las Vegas each day, maybe we can include paying customers on our adventures)33. Buy stuff to resell on etsy or ebay or craigslist (some people--hi blogger friends!--are great at doing this and it looks interesting but I'm not sure how I would do at this)34. Wear a sign and walk the strip (again, instead of using the car to show off advertising for a business, I could wear a sandwich board and walk The Strip)35. Sell one of my websites (the one that gets 1000+ visitors a day)36. Youtube videos of hubby cooking (some people make money from just their YouTube videos and don't even need a blog with it; I want to find out how this is done and make hubby a cooking star!)37. Resumes in 10 minutes (another idea for my booth at the swap meet; now I write resumes for free for anyone who asks)38. Sell pizza at UNLV or Nellis barracks (college students and guys in the military are usually hungry, when I was in college I would buy a bunch of $5 pizzas then sell them at the university for $10)39. Work concessions at National Finals Rodeo (there are so many concessionaires at UNLV and the convention center during big events that this might be an interesting part time job)40. Do extreme couponing then sell stuff at the swap meet (if I can buy stuff really cheap I could resell it at the swap meet for a profit)41. Save frap money (hubby gives me $5 a day for Starbucks, I could save this money and end up with$150!)42. Sell laptop and netbook (I have these two items in our storage shed that I don't need any more, I may try selling them even though they probably won't bring in much money)43. Ask people to give me money (every day I pass people on the street begging for money, I guess I could do this as well)44. Set up a social media campaign for a business (some businesses want to get into social media but don't know how. I could help them)45. Be about.com guide (I saw where about.com hires people to write for certain sections and they get paid about $700 a month for part time work)46. 101 things to do in Vegas tumblr with seo (some websites on a narrowly focused topic draw lots of hits, and therefore more ad money, so I may do this)47. Run errands for seniors (there are A LOT of seniors in Las Vegas so I thought about setting up an errand service for them)48. Holiday work at the mall (stores at the malls are hiring for holiday help so I may apply)49. Be an online juror for e-juries or trialjuries.com (I just learned about this last night and I love court cases plus you get paid to do this. Fun!)50. Shop for people (there may be a market for people to do other people's Christmas shopping for them)That was all I could come up with.  I may do one, some, or all of these idea during the course of next month in order to make my $1000."},
{"title": "My November 'Make $1000 Challenge'", "date": "Sunday, October 23, 2011", "text": "I was going to do the NaNoWriMo challenge in November (I still may, I haven't decided yet).  Then I was going to challenge myself to have 30 new experiences in Las Vegas during the month of November (can you tell I like challenges?).  And then I decided that I need some money because hopefully by early December we will be moving into our new place and will need to furnish it.  I am also dying for a new laptop, camera, and android phone.  Plus Christmas is coming up (yikes!).  So some extra money would come in handy right about now.I haven't earned much money since somewhere around January and it is a disconcerting feeling when I can't even buy a $100 item because I have no idea where that $100 will come from (in my previous life as a money-earning person, a $100 purchase was nothing now it is a Very. Big. Deal.).  So my challenge to myself (and you if you are so inclined to join me) is to make $1000 during the month of November.Currently I have no idea how I will do this as selling things is out (I have nothing left to sell), earning it via overtime at a job is out (I have no job), and stripping or something equally nefarious--we are in Las Vegas after all--is out (they would pay me to get OFF the stage...).  But some how I am going to earn me $1000 by the end of November...I just don't know how yet.  Of course I will post on this blog each day my success (or lack thereof) and hopefully give you some ideas that you can use to make some extra money as well."},

{"title": "An Update...Houses, Writing, and Oprah...Oh My!", "date": "Thursday, October 20, 2011", "text": "I'm going to have to start labeling these posts Monday Update, Tuesday Update, etc because it seems I don't write much content of substance lately, just quick updates whenever I have the opportunity.  Here's what I've been up to lately...We will make an offer on home #5 today.  I swear we have looked at dozens and dozens of properties but it is like swimming with the sharks--we make an offer and an investor (and there are LOTS of investors looking at cheap Vegas property these days) swoops in and makes a slightly higher but all cash offer and \"poof\" our deal is off the table.  The property we have settled on is one that we looked at three times so hubby figures that is the one we were probably meant to have.  There's an equal number of positives (big bedrooms, really clean, high ceilings, great parking, granite counter tops) and negatives (further from the Strip, weirdly shaped living room, near a busy road) but I think we can live with the negatives because we don't plan to live there very long, maybe a few years until prices rise then we can sell it for a profit and move to something better if we decide to stay in Las Vegas.  If nothing else it is super cheap ($70k) so we could always use it for a rental.  We'll see what happens. I won't believe we have actually got a house here until the moving van pulls up and we unload all of our stuff!I am loving all there is to do in Las Vegas.  Yesterday I went to a Ron Paul Rally (I love Ron Paul!) which was exciting.  This weekend we are going to the national police K-9 trials (which is free) and we may spring for the $20 tickets to the national Pro Bull Rider finals which will be here next weekend.  We have found an awesome $7.99 complete steak dinner special, have enjoyed lots of free buffets compliments of hubby's poker playing, and relatives come and go from this city like it is next door to where they live instead of across the country so we have been seeing lots of people we haven't seen in ages which has been fun.I still need to make some money.  I haven't really needed money since we have been traveling and there is nothing to buy that we can take with us but now there are a few material items I would like but simply don't have the money for so unless I get some sort of income coming in, I will be relegated to enjoying all of the old stuff I have been carting around in my backpack for almost a year.  I have an idea for a business which I may start here.  A job would be a last resort.Speaking of money, I have started working on my book again.  I was going full force on it last year but got lazy and didn't look at it for months.  Then I thought about the whole process of getting it published and again, got kind of demoralized.  Then I read about this girl and it looks like there may be a light at the end of the tunnel.  Plus it seems like every time I turn on the TV Oprah is on there saying \"find your calling!\" and I know that writing is my calling but I just wish it was something else.Speaking of money and writing...the internet hasn't been very agreeable with my computer at the place we are staying so each day when hubby goes to play poker I usually go to a nearby library (or a closed Starbucks in the back of the Rio where I can sit and use their wi fi for free) and get all of my online stuff done.  It's kind of odd because I have had internet at my home for years as well as in most of the places we have been staying since we started traveling but by doing it this way, not only am I getting free internet and a nice place to concentrate to do my webs and blogs, but when we get home in the evening I am more or less forced to work on my book because I don't have internet accessable to kill time with.  I am seriously thinking about not having internet at our new house (or cable TV for that matter, I just want to get a digital TV converter box for the basic stations).  Not only will this save us money but I will get a lot more work done this way!"},
{"title": "5 Things That Save Us the Most Money While Traveling", "date": "Sunday, October 16, 2011", "text": "I got to thinking about how much money we have saved while traveling over the past year and there are a handful of ways that consistently seem to save us money (both while traveling and while staying put for a while in one place):Cheap food.  We often seek out the cheapest places to eat, from hole in the wall taco shops to the Dollar Menu at fast food places (my favorite is a baked potato covered with a small bowl of chili at Wendys).  We also tend to cook cheap food at the places we are staying (soups, stews, beans and rice Mexican dishes, etc).  If we do go fancy and eat prime rib, you can bet it is from a free comp at the casino.Traveling light.  We each travel with one suitcase that we can carry on to airplanes.  Not only does this save us the checked baggage fee each time we fly but it really limits the amount of clothes we have (this means we hardly ever shop for clothes--why didn't I learn this thousands of dollars ago when I had to have nearly a whole new wardrobe each season??).Free and cheap entertainment.  The good thing about traveling is that everything is new to us when we get to different cities so we don't run out of \"new\" places to see.  Since we are holding tight to our money, however, the entertainment options that we find have to be both interesting AND cheap (preferably free).Finding the lowest prices on...everything.  I used to be pretty set in my ways. I HAD to have high speed internet at home, I HAD to go to a certain hair salon, I HAD to shop at the department stores my friends went to...  These days, especially when we are in an unfamiliar area, we are happy to just find things that we need.  So far we have found free internet (at lots of places), cheap hair salons (I paid around $2 for a haircut in the Philippines), and have currently rigged up our clothes on cheap-o racks we found at a thrift store (since the set up is temporary and we just wanted to get our clothes out of our suitcases, we got some cheap-o book racks out of our storage unit and organized our clothes on these...no need buying new racks they may or may not be workable in our new house).Using coupons.  Whenever possible we try to use coupons and discounts at the places we go.  We have found these everywhere including: the local newspaper, online, advertised in the window of the business, through Living Social and Groupon, via word of mouth from friends and relatives who live in the area, on the back of receipts from local businesses, etc."},

Here's what's been happening:The house situation.  As soon as we got the moving van unpacked and our stuff put into storage (literally...like a half hour later) we started looking for a place to buy.  We looked at about ten places and we found a condo that hubby totally loved so we made an offer on it.  The next day the seller came back with a counter offer which we agreed to.  Then the next day the seller gave us another counter offer (?) basically asking for a quick appraisal that we would pay for (the place was priced kind of high and I didn't even think it would appraise out at that price so I asked that if the seller was so confident in his price that HE pay for the appraisal and we would reimburse him when financing was complete OR he could agree to come down to the appraised price if it came in lower than the asking price).  Seller didn't like that so we rejected the deal.  We looked some more places and found a house that I totally loved so we made an offer.  It is a short sale which should strike fear into the heart of a buyer but since this is the first short sale we have made an offer on we are just in limbo for up to a month until the bank decides whether they want to sell it to us (we offered the asking price but then I heard that banks will offer short sales at super low prices then come back with a higher sale price once they know that someone is interested in the property).  tl;dr: buying a house in Las Vegas is a nightmare.The travel situation.  We were scheduled to have made a firm offer on a house then go to Connecticut on Tuesday evening.  We are still in Las Vegas.  We figured that with the housing situation up in the air, the last thing we should do is go 3,000 miles away.  That's what we did last time when we went back to Seattle then the deal fell through and we were too far away to look for another property until we came back to Las Vegas.  So that was $325 down the drain (the cost to change the tickets would have been over $300 just for the change fee). tl;dr: Airline costs are a nightmare too!Living in Las Vegas.  We are enjoying Las Vegas although we are still in a tenuous position here.  We are staying with a cousin who said we are welcome as long as we want to stay but we would still be happier with our own place.  We are enjoying finding all of the free and cheap things to do in Las Vegas, enjoying the weather (high 80s today!!), enjoying the food, and hubby is a happy camper at the poker tables.  Las Vegas is overall awesome!I need money.  Although we are getting by fine on hubby's income, I still feel like I need to make some money.  When we get the house I am sure I will want to decorate it (and probably do some home improvement projects too) and we have also been talking about going back to the Philippines next fall which will be a huge expense (everyone there is getting old and we don't want to wait too long to see them again).  Of course we will need cash for all of these things since we don't use credit so I need to get me some cash.  I have looked at the job ads and it is my usual response to job ads (ick! blah!) since I am not one to like a 9-5 job (which is why I have been self employed most of my life).  So I need to get busy setting up a business.  And I would really like to write a book.  Maybe a business around a book?  That's about all that is happening so far.  My fingers are crossed that we get the beautiful house that I love!p.s. Each day we try to explore something new--a restaurant, a place, a casino, an event, etc.  Today we went to check out the (free) conservatory at the Bellagio Casino. The photo above is of a grass horse which is part of their fall display."},
{"title": "10 Ways We Are Saving Money in Las Vegas", "date": "Monday, October 10, 2011", "text": "We have been in Las Vegas for almost a week, and of course my miserly tendencies are taking over.  Here's ten ways we have been saving money in Las Vegas:We are staying with a relative here while we are waiting to buy our new home.  We often do this when we are traveling--stay with friends and family--because it saves a boatload of money over paying for a hotel!We go out in the late morning and don't come back until early evening.  In other words, we plan our day and then go around and do the things we want to do (eat, hubby plays poker, shop, meet with the realtor, etc) instead of making many trips back and forth to home.  When we schedule a circuit of all of our tasks for the day we are able to save gas (oddly enough we haven't had to fill up the gas tank since we got here even though we are out every day, unlike in Seattle where we fill up twice a week sometimes.  Hubby says it's because the terrain is flat here instead of very hilly and the city is actually pretty small, size-wise, so we don't drive as far to get to places as in Seattle.  So maybe the money tip here is to move to a flat place in order to save gas?!).We are eagerly seeking out the best--and cheapest!--places to eat out when we don't cook at home.  So far we only eat breakfast at home then lunch and dinner out.  We have found a wonderful Filipino restaurant which serves a huge lunch for $3.99 (both of us share this) and a taco place with amazingly good Mexican-style tacos for $1.09 each (two is plenty for each of us).  Hubby is a poker player (fortunately when he loses it isn't too much and also fortunately, he usually wins or comes out even) and one of the things with playing poker is that the casinos \"comp\" people who play any of the games there.  In the last five days hubby has received free: two dinner buffets, two seafood buffets, and $20 for use in the casino's (amazing) Chinese restaurant. So besides utilizing comps, we have been checking to see what casinos comp the best.I bought an aluminum water bottle and some green tea today and my goal is to make my own beverage at home before we leave and drink it throughout the day.  While I am pretty much a Starbucks addict, the casino's Starbucks charge over $5 per drink!  That's way too much so I am hoping to break my Starbucks habit ASAP.I have been researching free and cheap things to do for entertainment in Las Vegas (and there are PLENTY of things to do here).  Last night we went and watched the Freemont Experience (a video/music presentation on the cover between the buildings downtown) which was free.  Later this week we will do the Ethel M candy factory and cactus garden tour which is free (and includes free samples!!!).  There is supposed to be a beautiful botanical garden at the Bellagio which is free which we will visit sometime.  Also, while I watched one matinee movie while hubby was playing (it was still $8 which is expensive for a movie) we found a theater that shows all movies for $1.50 which we will definitely check out.Exercise is free here.  We have been doing so much walking that I can't see why anyone would need to go to a gym.  There is plenty to see, the weather is perfect for walking (plus you can walk miles in the casinos), and when you get bored walking one place, there is always somewhere else to go.There are about a million places to shop here.  Every store you have ever heard of, not one but two premium outlet malls, each large casino has a shopping plaza...yikes.  So I am staying away from shopping as much as possible and have only hit Walmart for necessities and the LeSportsac outlet because I couldn't resist getting a new (but 65% off!) discount bag.As soon as we get an address here we will get local ID (Las Vegas driver's licenses).  We found out that locals get lots of cheap deals on attractions and meals that tourists have to pay much more for.  Hubby's cousins have this down to a science and can tell you every discount for locals in the entire Las Vegas Valley.Since we haven't moved yet, we have been doing some window shopping (instead of real shopping which saves lots of money and besides, we don't have any more space to store any new purchases).  Today we made an offer on a two bed, two bath condo (we were looking at bigger houses but want to refrain from buying big again which requires bigger energy bills) and we both decided that sparse furnishings are the way to go.  Finally...we agree on something!  We will furnish the new place with what we have and fill in the holes as we go with sale/discount/thrift store items.  We don't want to end up like last time with a house full of stuff that, should we want to sell it, won't bring more than 10 cents on the dollar.Of course I will make it my goal to find more and more cheap ways to live here (unless I want to go back to work which mostly I don't want to do unless I find something interesting to do).  Also, on the way here I dropped my $200+ Canon digital camera and something inside broke because every photo after that had a big glob right in the middle of the picture so instead of getting something similar I went for the cheapest camera I could find (a $99 Casio Exilim) which I am happy to report still takes good pictures (like the one at the top of this post).p.s. I have started (yet another) blog to record all of my \"living in Las Vegas\" stuff so my travel blog doesn't become a Las Vegas blog.  You can find it here."},
{"title": "Seven Things", "date": "Sunday, October 9, 2011", "text": "Obviously I am way way behind on my reading but I came across this blog post at Making Sense of Cents and thought I would add to the collection of posts on this topic.The idea is to list seven things you can't give up, seven things you could give up, and seven things you have already given up.  Here's my list:Seven Things I Can't Give UpInternet access (the internet provides my income, social life, education, etc).Starbucks (I've tried!  I can't!).Tithing (this is something I am compelled to do every month).Reading (I am a voracious reader...at least I get free books at the library and online).The hubby (we are like Siamese twins, always together and we like it that way).My cell phone (it, like the internet, is my only connection to the outside world).Helping people (it's just what I do).Seven Things I Could Give UpEating out (we don't eat out as much as we used to and now only eat out for convenience but I can certainly do without it).The dryer (now that we are in Las Vegas, I really should try hanging clothes outside to save money. I'm lazy though).Facebook (I use it to keep up with what family is doing but it is inane and a waste of time).Nail polish (it's a hassle keeping my nails looking nice now that I do it myself...maybe I will just go with the natural look).Traveling so much (hopefully we will get a place and settle down soon; I am looking for a happy medium between staying home and traveling).The need to feel responsible for everyone and everything (it's a bad habit).Wheat and dairy and chocolate (I waver back and forth between a good diet and a not so good diet; I have given these items up in the past but keep going back to them).Seven Things I Have Already Given UpMy car (we are now a one car family and it saves us a TON of money).Credit cards (ditto).A home (we have been \"homeless\" since February and traveling.  I never thought it would be possible to give up the security of a home but we did and it isn't so bad).Designer everything.  I used to have to have a new (designer) outfit every time we went to the club.  I loved designer purses, designer shoes, designer home decor...basically if there was something to boost my ego and spend a lot of money on at the same time I was there.  I'm not there any more and it isn't as traumatic a change as I thought it would be.A job.  At the beginning of this year things kind of culminated in me not having a job for the first time since I was 16.  For some reason I seem to have more money now than those days when I would panic nearly every day about how much my check would be, what would happen if I lost my job, how I could stand one more day with a hideous co worker, etc.Friends.  It's odd but when you don't have a home and job, you don't have a lot of \"built in\" friends.  I have a handful of very good friends and that's it, not dozens and dozens of work and neighborhood-related friends who were more friends out of convenience than anything else.Spending money I didn't have (including credit cards, loans from friends, overdrawing my bank account, etc)."},
{"title": "Past Good Deeds Can Really Pay Off!", "date": "Saturday, October 8, 2011", "text": "Since the house finding in Las Vegas is taking longer than expected--it would go faster if people would quit beating us to putting in their bids on the houses WE want--we may end up cancelling our trip to Connecticut and just stay here in Las Vegas until we end up with an actual house to move in to. Yesterday the hubby asked his cousin if she would mind if we stayed with her for another week or so until we find an apartment to rent for a few months and she said she wouldn't hear of it--until we move into our house we are staying with her.  He of course thanked her and apologized for the inconvenience but she said \"you remember those years ago when April helped me out?  This won't even come close to paying her back.\"  Wow.  I didn't even remember being much help to her but I did help her out during her divorce (some 20 years ago...which I had totally forgot about) and she stayed at our house for a couple of months while she was getting back on her feet (something else I had totally forgot about).And then it dawned on me that everyone we have stayed with this past year had mentioned something similar to us.  Hubby's sister commented on how he had helped put her through college (40 years ago! Hubby can barely remember last month so he didn't even remember this), his cousin that we stayed with in Seattle mentioned how he and his family had stayed with us for a couple of months (again, many years ago) while their house was being built, and my friend in Japan mentioned the time she and a friend stayed at my house during her travels to the US and the time I met her in San Diego and took her around California to see the sites.The odd thing is that I barely remembered these things and we certainly didn't expect to be \"paid back\" for doing any of these things.  Doing favors for people or helping people out when needed is something I learned as a kid from my mother and grandparents who were all very giving (even though they had very little to give).  Back then it was called 'being neighborly'.  So I guess the moral of this post is that while helping people out should be done willingly and without regard for any payback, the universe/karma is quite good about bringing the payback back around...even if it is many years later.  Wow.  Amazing."},
{"title": "Moving to Vegas...Here's How Much It Has Cost So Far", "date": "Thursday, October 6, 2011", "text": "We are a week into our move to Las Vegas.  (Don't get me started on the fact that it has been raining since we got here...I'm from Seattle and expected much better weather!).  We have been looking at houses for two days and they are all becoming a blur but hopefully we will find something to make an offer on before we leave for Connecticut next week.  Here's how much our move cost:First, and pretty importantly, hubby has a bunch of cousins here so we have a place to stay for free while we are shopping for a house.We rented a 15' Budget rental truck and car carrier for the move.  Doing it ourselves was much cheaper than hiring a moving company.  I also checked the rates for U Haul and PODS but both were more expensive (note: PODS would have cost about the same but we would have still had to drive our car down so the cost for gas would have put the price higher than doing it the way we did).  Cost for the truck: $972.02.  Cost for the gas: $599.26.  Cost for the hotel (we drove the whole distance in two days, stopping overnight at Motel 6 after 14 HOURS of driving on the first day): $44.70.We loaded all of our stuff from our storage shed into the truck ourselves with the help of a couple of (very nice) friends.  We had some unused restaurant gift certificates for some nice restaurants in Seattle so we gave them these as payment.When we got to Las Vegas, a cousin referred us to the storage company she uses so we got our first month free.  The cost of the storage shed (10x10) is $75 a month which is $20 more than we were paying in our old location but it is bigger and it is air conditioned so I guess that's why it cost more.  Hopefully we will be able to close the house sale within two months so that would be $75 for two months!Hubby and I unpacked the moving truck ourselves and loaded the stuff into the storage shed (it took A LOT of work!).  Hubby keeps reminding me he is 62 and shouldn't be doing this but we were too cheap to go find some day laborers to do the job for us so slowly but surely we eventually got the truck unloaded.  We have been cooking at home so this is saving some money but it is hard to eat all three meals at home while we are guests.  I think when we move to our new place I will eat at home for a solid month since this is something I miss because of traveling so much.So that's the cost of our move so far.  A cheaper way to move would have been to sell everything and drive down with people found on CraigsList to share the cost of gas but the stuff we had in storage would cost much more than the $1700 that we have spent so far to replace once we get moved.tl;dr  Moving is hard work and not cheap."},
{"title": "Checking In...And We Are Off to Vegas", "date": "Saturday, October 1, 2011", "text": "It's been a whole week since I last posted!  Sorry, it's been a zoo around here so here's a quick update:We leave for Las Vegas tomorrow.  We will be picking up a truck from Budget Truck Rental (a lot cheaper than U Haul and way way cheaper than using PODS--which I would have preferred because it is a simple way to move--but we are saving money in every way possible so a semi-expensive rental truck and towing the car behind us is what we will do).  I am NOT looking forward to the 20 hour drive to Las Vegas, but then again, we are doing this as cheaply as possible...  Money lesson: expensive=comfortable. Cheap=uncomfortable.When we get to Las Vegas we will put our stuff in storage until we find a house to buy and the sale closes.  Fortunately the cousin we will be staying with in Las Vegas while we are looking for a house gave me the number to the storage unit place she uses so we will get our first month free and she will also get a free month for referring us.  That turned out well financially for everyone.  Money lesson: let people know if you need help with something and they may surprise you will what they come up with!As soon as we get the truck unloaded and returned we will be meeting up with the realtor and we will find a place to buy within a week (I hope, our tickets to Connecticut have us leaving Las Vegas a week after we arrive!).  The realtor has already sent us some great-looking listings so we are hopeful that we will find something.  Although we originally wanted a small condo, I think we will end up with a bigger house but that may work out OK because it sounds like we will have a lot of guests after we get settled.  Money lesson: thank goodness the houses in Las Vegas are super cheap and there are plenty to choose from!A week after we arrive in Las Vegas we will be heading to Connecticut to visit family and friends.  We were supposed to go there last spring but got side tracked with a longer-than-expected stay in Atlanta.  We don't have a return ticket because we don't know how fast the house will close so after a month or so in Connecticut, we may end up going to Atlanta until the house closes if it takes longer than expected.  I want to get out of Connecticut before it snows!  Money lesson: not really a lesson, but I hope we can find cheap tickets to get us to Atlanta and/or back to Las Vegas!Hubby just learned how to use FaceBook.  It is good because he can keep up with the kids and grandkids, it isn't so good because he asks me a million questions about it (usually while I am in the middle of proofreading documents or designing a website). Eeekkk  Money lesson: just like I try to be patient with money things, I need to be more patient with hubby!I really miss baking. I'm not sure why it just hit me but all of the sudden I want to bake.  I want to bake pizza and cookies and a cake and bread...  It isn't really convenient to bake where we are staying so I will just dream about my new kitchen and wait a couple of more months.  Money lesson: it is hard to cook for yourself while you are on the road.Finally, I kind of can't wait to move to Las Vegas and try some of the money saving things I learned in Japan.  For example, my friend always hangs her laundry outside to dry and never uses her dryer, she has an on-demand water heater which I want to find out about getting installed because it seems a much better (and cheaper) option than having a big tank of water that is kept continually hot.  Also, I want to look into solar power.  Las Vegas has a lot of sun so it just makes sense to use it to power our house if at all possible.  Money lesson: I'm going to try to be super frugal once we get settled.I hope you are all doing well and will get back to reading your blogs as soon as possible!"},

{"title": "Oh The Places You'll Go (And the People You'll Meet!)", "date": "Wednesday, September 21, 2011", "text": "One of my favorite things about traveling is the people I meet along the way. In fact, the main impetus for our Asia trip was to meet up with a few people we haven’t seen in quite a long time. Here’s my people stories (money stories included!):Ms Tamura is the lady I went to see in Japan. No matter what, I decided that this was my year to visit her. You see, I have never met her before but we have been writing to each other for over twenty years and after a number of times of intending to go to Japan (but never making it) and after realizing that she is in her mid 80s I figured it was now or quite possibly never. It’s kind of a weird story how we started writing to each other. When I was an exchange student in Japan more than 25 years ago, I went with my host father to his night job of teaching English at a nurse’s school. I met the director of the school who was a very nice lady and we started writing to each other when I came back to the states. A few years later I got a letter from Ms Tamura, the new director of the school, stating that Ms Sasaki had passed away. We have been writing back and forth ever since. I appreciate that she has put up with my lousy (and impolite!) Japanese for so many years and that she always has interesting things to tell me in her letters. On this trip I was so happy to meet her finally. We got together with my old host family, who acted as interpreters since my spoken Japanese is worse than my written Japanese, and went to meet her twice during my stay. She is just as amazing in person as I thought she would be. Apparently she is/was quite the rebel as she used to drive a Harley and now drives a “big car” (I didn’t find out the exact make of the car but big cars aren’t all that common in Japan). She was going to be a nun but changed her mind, has traveled extensively, and really reminds me of my grandmother. I wanted to take her home with me! Money story: when I was leaving, we exchanged gifts. I gave her a few simple things and she gave me what I assume was a very expensive pearl and diamond necklace judging by the sudden intake of breath by my group and their shocked expression. They kept exclaiming that it was a treasure. I was shocked too. Lesson: you never know when you will be given an amazing gift (but it seems to be much more likely to happen when you travel).When I first planned my trip to Japan, I figured I would meet up with my host sister Kiyo from way back when and then I would be on my way to visit other people. I was astounded that not only did she meet me at the airport when I arrived but she never left my side for the entire time I was in Japan! We have kept in touch over the years and write back and forth quite often but her dedication to making my trip a success was above and beyond anything I expected. Not only was she my guide and translator, but she would not let me pay for a single thing during my stay (I literally mean not a SINGLE thing!) I withdrew a couple of hundred dollars when I arrived at the airport thinking I would hit the bank the next day when I got a better idea of my expenses and that money was still in my wallet the day I left (I subsequently gave it to her kids when I left as a gift). She literally paid for everything—meals, water, multiple—expensive—bus, train, and airline tickets, and when we went to southern Japan to meet up with her parents and Ms Tamura, her parents then paid for a resort we spent the night at and food for every meal! They all insisted that since I was their guest, I couldn’t pay for anything. Again, I was super shocked at the generosity and hospitality that I received there. I felt kind of bad that the costs were so many and from my calculations, so high (I am guessing it totaled around $1500) but apparently her husband is a well-paid engineer at the largest cell company in Japan (it says he has a doctorate in engineering on his business card and they own a big, brand new house in the middle of Tokyo). Even her two kids were generous to a fault. Holy cow. Again I was stunned. Money lesson: same as above, sometimes the financial blessings just rain down on you when you least expect it. She also mentioned how much I did for her and her friends the couple of times they came to the states but I really can’t remember doing that much for them so the corollary may be to treat your guests amazingly well and your good deeds will come back to you at a later date.I met up with my sister in law unexpectedly in the Philippines. We didn’t even know she was there as she lives in New York and hadn’t mentioned traveling anywhere this fall. She knows I don’t eat much Filipino food and asked what I had been eating during my stay. I told her Shakeys and fried chicken and rice then I asked her if there were any Indian restaurants in the area because I had noticed quite a few Indians walking by on the street. She said she didn’t know of any but would ask around. A couple of days later a lady called me and said she was a friend of my sister in law and said she would like to bring me some Indian food. I said fine, thinking my SIL had picked it up at a restaurant and was having it delivered to me which would have been very nice in and of itself. So the lady arrived with a homemade, six course Indian meal and I nearly fell off my chair! Not only that but she stayed and ate with me and explained that the meal was a special vegetarian meal made by her sister in law in honor of the death day of the lady’s husband (apparently in her religion, on the anniversary of someone’s death, the family makes food and gives it away to other family members and friends to honor the person who had died). Not only that but it turned out the lady is a fairly well-known artist from India who was now living in the Philippines. We talked about art and religion and spirituality and family and travel and spent a very enjoyable couple of hours together. Money lesson: same as the other two…you never know when people will go out of their way to do amazing things for you.

{"title": "Back in the US...And a Financial Wrap Up for Our Trip", "date": "Tuesday, September 20, 2011", "text": "We got back yesterday from our Asia trip and besides being jet lagged, I am happy to get back to blogging.  Here's a post about the Philippines from my other blog.  And now the part you have all been waiting for...the final tally for our 19 day trip to Asia:Round-trip airfare Seattle to Manila  $1,814.20Hotel in Manila for nine days $429.77Hotel in Davao for nine days $422.77Round-trip airfare Manila to Davao $229.53Round-trip airfare Manila to Tokyo  $568.40Spending money $5,500.00For a grand total of $8,964.67And now some explanation...We could have got our round trip airfare to Japan for about $30 total through the military but that is a very hit or miss proposition and the possibility of being stranded in Japan for literally weeks until there was space to fly was very possible so we opted for regular airline tickets.  We stayed in hotels in Manila and Davao because although we could have stayed for free with family and friends, we feel like it would be too much of an imposition (we use a lot of air conditioning, hot water, toilet paper, etc which is relatively expensive there plus we like our privacy--and I'm really picky about the cleanliness and modernness of my surroundings...).  I did stay for free with my friends in Japan (and got all of my other expenses in Japan for free there as well but that will be tomorrow's post!). We used a low cost local airline for our trip to Davao and got what I felt was a good price on the tickets (although they get you on the baggage fees so it is best to pack light!) but I opted for the higher priced ticket to go to Japan (I could have flown the cheaper airline to Japan but it landed late at night in a city I didn't need to go to so this was more expensive but more convenient).  Our biggest expense was spending money.  Although the Philippines can be pretty cheap for budget travelers, when you are returning \"home\" as my husband did since he is from the Philippines, going there can be fairly expensive.  It is expected that he will pay for food, transportation and spending money for all of the friends and family members he sees in the Philippines (that's just the way it is done) and it is also a given that he will give money to all of his friends and relatives as well (another cultural thing).  So we ended up buying meals for more than a dozen people each day and giving massive amounts of cash as gifts to nearly everyone.  The last time we went there we spent way more so this was better as far as money goes but overall still pretty expensive!We did have a wonderful time and everything worked out well.  We were fortunate in that we currently don't have any bills or house payments so we could easily pay for the trip and we also felt it was important to go at this time because some of the people we went there to see are getting up to their 90s and you never know how long they will be around.We have saddled ourselves with a few financial obligations related to our trip after coming home.  At the grandsons's school, we found that they have hardly any school supplies for about a dozen classes with 50 plus students in each class so I will put together a box of school supplies to send there (hopefully friends will help me by donating supplies to go in the box too).  My husband's son lives in what it literally a hut made of bamboo and palm fronds so we have committed to providing the funds to build him a better house (around $10,000 spread out over a few years), and I will be sending gifts to my friend and her extended family in Japan (about 13 people) because they literally paid for every single thing during my stay there (to the tune of over $1500!).Overall we had an amazing time and look forward to going again (probably in two or three years).  Of course we will need to start saving for that trip now.  Our next adventure entails moving all of our household goods to Las Vegas in a couple of weeks, finding and making an offer on a house there, then going to Connecticut for a month or two in mid October.p.s. I am going to be happy when we get settled into a new place and stop traveling so much!"},

Hope you all are doing well--sorry I haven't read anyone's blogs since we left the states so I will have a lot of reading to do when I get home!"},
{"title": "We Made it to the Philippines!", "date": "Friday, September 2, 2011", "text": "We landed last night in the Philippines and now the fun begins!  Actually now I need a nap...the flight was 16 torturous hours long (the worst part about Asian travel is actually getting here because it takes so long!) but I am happy to report that the weather is beautiful--humid and warm but not too hot.  The food so far is great (we like to eat at a small Chinese restaurant in Makati Manila) and the hotel is pretty nice but relatively cheap for being in a major city (about $45 a night).  Hubby's cousin picked us up at the airport last night and took us to our hotel and it just so happened that they had karaoke going in the hotel's night club so the cousin jumped up and sang and he is awesome (he is the lead singer in a famous band in the Philippines so people were pretty shocked to see him singing there).  The worst thing about Manila? Trying to cross the street without getting run over.  It isn't for the faint of heart and since the traffic never actually stops you just need to step off the curb and walk and hope people stop for you!  I'm trying to keep track of all of our expense for the trip so I will be able to give you a complete financial run down at the end (note that as soon as you step off the plane, hubby starts tipping people so that part may be hard to quantify).  So far he has tipped: the guy that opens the door for us at the hotel, the three people who waited on us at the hotel night club, the guy that brought up extra towels, the guy that brought our luggage to the room, the waiter in the restaurant, an old woman that was begging in the street...I guess this is all part of big city life but for the past few months we have been, more or less, small town people where you don't have to tip everyone you see!."},

{"title": "Gah! Back to Square One", "date": "Friday, August 26, 2011", "text": "So our lender called yesterday and our condo is a no go.  (If you are a new reader, I'll give you the Reader's Digest version on our condo story: currently we are homeless.  We sold our house and nearly everything in it at the beginning of the year and have been traveling and staying with friends and family along the way.  When we ended up in Las Vegas a couple of months ago, a cousin said 'you HAVE to buy here now because prices are SO low'.  And they are.  We decided to make Las Vegas our home base and within a couple of days of arriving we found the perfect condo and promptly made an offer.  Since it is a bank-owned property, we weren't too distressed that the process to buy the condo was stretching out for months; as we are currently in Seattle and will be heading to Asia next week, it isn't like we need to move in any time soon.)So fast forward to yesterday.  After signing a massive amount of documents over the past couple of months, getting the financing in line, and having the inspection done, the very nice lender lady called and told us that the selling agent was an idiot (not in so many words but I know that's what she meant).  The selling agent had put down that the condo was FHA and VA approved (meaning the buyer--us--can get one of these standard loans for the condo--some condos are not FHA or VA approved because they have a too high vacancy rate or too many of the units are renter instead of owner occupied).  Everyone--our realtor, our lender, and us--went on the selling agent's assumption and proceeded to move forward with the sale.Turns out this development is not FHA/VA approved so the lender said that if we want the condo, we will need to make a cash offer (being the nice lender that she is, she also warned us that if we do buy with cash, we would have a difficult time in the future selling the unit because, again, the new buyer would not be able to get a loan for it).I don't happen to have $64,000 in cash laying around and while I am super tempted to borrow the cash from a couple of people that I am sure would loan it to us, no questions asked, it goes against my number one rule of never borrowing or loaning money to family or friends as this is the surest way to end up with people hating you (ie: if you get sick or lose your job and can't pay the loan, the banks have a built in cushion whereas friends or family who do such a thing don't so you have not only sunk your own self financially but someone else as well. Not a good idea).So the personal loan idea is out the window and we are back at square one.  Since hubby really, really wants to live in Las Vegas, our new plan is to come back from Asia, get a rental truck, drive our meager belongings down there and put them in a storage unit (currently they are in a storage unit in the Seattle area), find another place to make an offer on, then head to the east coast for a couple of months until the home closes then fly back to Vegas and move in. Whew. If only it is that easy!"},

{"title": "25 Ways to Send Your Kids Back to School on the Cheap", "date": "Wednesday, August 17, 2011", "text": "The mall was a madhouse last weekend and it only took a few minutes to dawn on me that it was already time for kids to get ready to go back to school.  Where did the summer go? It went by so quickly!  Here's a bunch of ways to get your kids off to school this fall without breaking the bank:Buy school supplies now while they are on sale.  In fact, get enough school supplies to last them for the entire year instead of paying top dollar to replenish their supplies later in the school year.\rStart school shopping for clothes at garage sales and thrift stores then work your way up to discounters (Ross, Marshalls, Walmart, and TJ Maxx) then hit the mall.  Hopefully by the time you get to the mall, most of your shopping will be completed.\rSign up for free or reduced school breakfasts and lunches if you qualify.\rAlways make your kids a simple, healthy breakfast before they leave for school in the morning if they don't eat breakfast at school--they will be more likely to pay attention in class.\rReview cell phone plans.  My sister pays $100 per kid for their cell phone plan which is shockingly high IMHO.  My prepaid plan costs only $30 per month.  Look at all of your options and find the cheapest plan based on current use (ie: some kids text only so look for a plan with fewer calling minutes and more texting minutes).\rIf you are having a rough time financially, look around at community programs to see if you can get free backpacks/haircuts/school supplies/vaccinations/etc for your kids.  There are a half dozen programs in our area that are offering these things to get kids ready to go back to school.\rIf your kids don't qualify for free or reduced school lunch (or you question how healthy these lunches are) get your kids in the habit of taking their lunch from home.\rWhen our boys were in school, we would go to Walmart and buy 24 pair of the exact same socks (black, boy's athletic socks) this way we never spent time hunting for matches for their socks in the morning because they all matched!\rGet your kids into a routine and stick with it.  When kids automatically (kind of) do homework every day after school, automatically (kind of) go to sleep at the same time each evening, and wake up automatically (kind of) each morning, the routine eventually becomes a habit.\rStart reading with your kids before they go back to school--it gets them into the rhythm of learning before the school doors even open (get free books from the library of course).\rHave your kids walk to school (in a group, of course) if at all possible.  I know many parents who will drive their kids two or three blocks to school when it is cheaper (and healthier!) for their kids to walk.\rBetter yet, walk with them if you can.  It will improve your health as well.\rConsider a babysitting co-op if you and your neighbors have kids roughly the same age.  If each parent takes a day to watch the kids before and after school and you have five parents willing to do this, you will end up with free before and after school care for your kids.\rMake sure you have after school snacks ready for your kids when they get home.  Preferably something healthy and simple to make (this saves going through the drive-thru on the way home because everyone is starving).  Things like popcorn, vegetables and hummus, cheese and crackers, etc are inexpensive and easy to serve.\rEncourage your kids to participate in sports and extra-curricular activities.  Yes, there is some added expense, but busy kids are kids that don't have time to get into trouble (definitely a more expensive proposition).  It also develops life-long skills and looks good on college applications.\rLook for hand-me-downs.  Whether it is clothes or sports equipment or expensive school supplies such as graphing calculators, ask around to see if friends or relatives with older kids could provide these to you at little or no cost.  Of course you will want to return the favor by sending things your kids no longer need to those who could use the items.\rDon't forget Freecycle, eBay, and CraigsList where you can find cheaper-than-retail versions of everything from cell phones to sports equipment to clothes.\rWhen clothes shopping, look at summer clearance items that can be used into the fall.  Flip flops, tank tops, and shorts are often on sale now but these items seem to be year-round apparel for teens in our area.\rEncourage your kids to work and split the cost with you for items they want but don't need (iPad, etc).  Obviously you don't want them to work so much it interferes with school but small jobs on the weekends can bring in some cash.  I'm absolutely shocked at the huge number of kids who graduate from college then complain that they can't get a job because they have absolutely zero work experience!  There's no reason kids can't learn how to make a bit of their own money.\rBuy for next year.  When the kids were young and growing I would often shop for super duper clearance items that were too big for them; I would buy the item then bring it out at a later date and surprise them with new clothes throughout the year.\rSeek (free) help with homework.  The kids surpassed my math skills around middle school.  For those homework problems that you can't figure out, find free home work help online here.  Also, our local library has a free homework help section on their website.  Plus you can Google just about anything these days.\rAvoid high legal fees (and the whole legal process!) by keeping your kids occupied and supervised.  Many of the kids I saw come through the juvenile justice system were there (aside from having lousy parents) because they were left bored and unsupervised and then one of their other bored and unsupervised friends would say \"hey let's go do (fill in the blank with something illegal).\"\rApply for scholarships NOW.  Apply for every one that your kid would even remotely qualify for.  A free higher education is a very good thing.\rParticipate in your kid's school life as much as possible.  Kids with parents who are involved in their school life (by volunteering, helping to coach a sports team, helping to chaperon a dance, etc) often have kids who are more successful.  You don't want to be your kid's BFF but you do want to be connected.\rAnother reason to keep your kids busy with activities--when you limit their exposure to TV and other advertising, you will be able to save money.  I was shocked at the amount of advertising kids see in only one cartoon program when I watched TV with my nieces a few months ago.  Of course after they saw this they immediately NEEDED the item.  Eekkk."},
{"title": "Giving", "date": "Sunday, August 14, 2011", "text": "While the majority of my blog is dedicated to saving money and being very frugal with the money I spend, today's post will be about parting with some of your money via giving.  I have always been very helpful by nature.  If someone is hungry, I will buy them a meal, if someone is cold, I will buy them a coat.  And then some years ago, I learned about tithing.  Even though I am not religious and don't go to church (I tend to go randomly if I come across a church that interests me but I think God can be found everywhere so adhering to strict religious doctrine tends to make me want to run the other way), I learned about tithing and have been tithing a part of my income ever since (it's probably been about ten years so far).  The weird thing is that it really does seem that what you give away tends to come back to you multiplied.  So while it is not right to determine how much to give based on a particular financial calculation of how much you intend get back, giving and tithing seems to open the flow of money both coming from and going to you.  This is how I give away some of my money:I tithe monthly to the Unity/Daily Word organization.  This is about as close as I come to a regular church. I love the positive message of this religion and I read Daily Word quite often to find inspiration.\rI give randomly to organizations, churches, non profits, and events that need funding.  This was much easier to do when I actually had a good income coming in.  These days I mostly give my time and effort instead of money since I have much more of the former than the latter.\rI give my money, time, and effort to the non profit I started some years ago.  After volunteering and working with various groups (kids--not my thing, the homeless--definitely not my thing) I started working with refugees and immigrants and then it hit me that working with this group is exactly my thing.  So as much as I can, I still work with this group and tend to automatically run into many situations when traveling where I can help other refugees and immigrants too.\rI rarely donate to political causes because I think most politicians are....well there is no polite way to say what I think of most politicians.  However I am a big fan of Ron Paul so during the last election when he was having an online fundraiser that raised over $4.2 million in one day, I donated and was a part of that which was a very amazing feeling.\rSometimes I come across causes that I just feel pulled to donate to like these ladies that I saw on a television program and thought they should be supported.  They help so many people that I felt like I should help them.\rFinally, there are emotional pulls that I sometimes can't resist.  When I saw this girl's story tragic story, especially since her death happened so close to where we are, I felt compelled to donate and amazingly, what started out as a girl trying to raise $300 for charity has now grown to over $1 million in donations.  Being part of that gives me the chills!\rThe bottom line is that while being frugal with your money, especially if you are still trying to get out of debt, is obviously the most logical thing to do, don't forget to give away a little of what you earn.  Carefully spending your money is one thing, but hoarding your money is totally different.  Share and give when it is needed and you will be amazed at how your generosity is repaid!"},
{"title": "Yikes! I'm So Stressed!", "date": "Thursday, August 11, 2011", "text": "Sorry for the lack of posts lately, it's been a zoo around here!  So before I go off and have a meltdown from all of the stress I have been under, I'll give you a quick update:We will be leaving for Japan and the Philippines in a few weeks.  It looks like the trip will be way more expensive than we had planned.  The price for air tickets within Asia has increased a lot since the last time we were there, ditto for hotels in the Philippines.  This may be our last big trip before we regroup, earn some more money, and put more money back in savings.\rSomeone from my husbands family started a FaceBook \"clan\" group page and there are currently 296 people in the group (!).  I posted on there that we should have a meet up when we get to the Philippines since that is where most of the family lives.  I assumed that \"meet up\" was the same term as here in the states--you set a date, time, and place and people show up, buy a beer, chat, and whatever.  Hubby reminded me that if I arrange to meet with anyone there they will expect me to pay since I am the \"rich\" American and I did send the invite. Ayayay.  I can barely pay for myself let alone 200+ people!\rIt is taking forever to close the condo.  I knew that because it was a repo it would probably be more complicated than a standard home purchase but the unprofessionalism and apparent incompetency of some of the people involved is astounding.  They send a bunch of documents, say sign these, the documents aren't complete or accurate, I call, they call back, I am stubborn about not signing any legal document that isn't both complete and/or accurate, they relent, I am grouchy...ayayay.  You would think that if the place is vacant, bank-owned, and the mortgage company is just waiting to pay for the property things would move along faster but apparently that isn't so.  I am hopeful that it will eventually close.  Sometime.\rMy non-profit, the one that I founded almost a decade ago, is on rough financial footing like most non profits these days.  I went to the Board meeting and our treasurer said :\"raise $5000 by the end of this month or we will have to close\". Yikes!  I haven't done much with the organization over the past year but it is like someone saying pay up or we will get rid of your kid!  So I have been writing grants like a maniac and we have been asking everyone we know if they can donate.  There has got to be a better way to fund a non profit besides writing grants and crossing your fingers...\rWe figured out that we will need to rent a moving van, fill it with our stuff, and tow our car behind it when we move to Las Vegas (if and when the condo closes!).  It looks like we may not move until the first week of October.  Just thinking about all of the work makes me cringe.\rI am trying to study up on my Japanese since I hardly remember any of it and most of the people I know in Japan don't speak English.  I was going full speed ahead then kind of hit a wall and haven't picked up the book in a week.  I don't know what's wrong with me but I have to get back to studying!\rThere hasn't been much sun here since we got back which probably isn't helping with my mood (it hasn't even reached 85 degrees yet this year in Seattle!).\rFor the life of me I can't stick to a healthy eating plan (and it is showing!).  Oh to be young, super active, and be able to eat anything without gaining an ounce.  Starbucks is going to be the death of me!\rMoney, money, money.  I guess most of my stress is money stress.  There are so many things I want to do (buy a whole new wardrobe since I have been wearing my current clothes for almost a year, buy lots of nice--read, expensive--gifts for my friends in Japan, easily pay all of our travel costs and then moving costs) but we simply don't have the money to do this.  It was easy in the beginning to be frugal and not spend money because we weren't doing much but staying with family and hanging out.  Now so many expenses are cropping up that I need to win the lottery or something (except that I don't play the lottery so this would be difficult). \rI think that is all so far.  Sorry for the downer.  I hope the rest of you are having an amazing summer!"},

Yummy!).Gave away a bunch of clothes and shoes I no longer need when I met up with my sister (I love to give stuff away, it's a habit, and it makes other people happy).Took a walk with the hubby along the waterfront (sun, great views, awesome hubby...what more can I ask for?).Got a free drink from Starbucks.  They made a mistake with my drink so gave me a free drink coupon to use later.Made plans with my friends in Japan (via email so that too was free which is way cheaper than a letter or phone call).Found a free car seat for a lady who came into our Center and couldn't afford one (some agencies in our area provide free child safety seats so we just connected her with them).Got enough apples to choke a horse (a friend went to Eastern Washington and brought back a huge bag of apples and gave me a big sack of them.  Yummy...and free).Played racquetball (also free at the navy base).Reinforced my Japanese skills for free (at this website).  I'm still studying away with my books but I like the online quizzes better.Got free white strips (they were sitting in the cabinet at the cousin's house where we are staying and they looked dusty so I told her if she didn't need them I would be happy to use them and she said go ahead.  Now my teeth are getting whiter.  Happy).I've taken a ton of photographs.  I am not a great photographer by any stretch of the imagination but I do like to take pictures and with a digital camera, this is pretty much a free hobby).Got an extra 25% off a purse I was buying.  The sales clerk knew me and asked why I didn't use the coupon that came in the mail (I told her our mail goes to a remailing center and they toss all of the junk mail before sending the rest to us) so she gave me the coupon that went out in the mailer.  So while the purse wasn't free, I did get a free coupon that usually is only mailed to customers and I did save 25%.Found some old clothes I hadn't seen in a while.  I was complaining to hubby that my clothes were old and I was tired of wearing the same thing all the time so before we went to the mall (smart hubby) we stopped by the storage shed and he hauled out a tub of my old clothes.  There was stuff in there I had forgotten all about! So no need to go to the mall, I just picked out some clothes to take back to the house and it was almost like shopping, only free."},

Unfortunately, my nephew is the determined sort and he really wanted the truck.  I had this same sort of  \"I'm going to get this brand new car and I don't care how much logic and reasoning you throw at me\" determination and repeatedly bought cars I couldn't afford simply because I wanted it and the car dealers/lenders didn't seem to care that I was spending 50% of my income on a car that would depreciate like a rock as soon as I drove it off the lot.  So now I am a reformed idiot hoping to use my hard won lessons to teach others.  Unfortunately my nephew was as deaf to my reasoning as I was to anyone who tried to dissuade me from stupid purchases years ago.Now my nephew is the owner of a brand new truck (which gets like 10 miles to the gallon!) and seven YEARS of $600 car payments. Ugh.  I am so disappointed!"},

{"title": "If You Don't Work...What Do You Do?", "date": "Tuesday, July 19, 2011", "text": "First, someone asked me this very question today.  \"If you aren't working, what do you do with all of your time?\" she asked.  Then I ran across this blog post which mentioned the same thing, basically, one of the three requirements for retiring is that you must be able to enjoy living without working.  Since I haven't worked in nearly eight months, I think I have pretty much got the hang of not working.  Surprisingly, it does take some getting used to!  Who would have thought that not working can take some effort as, for many people, being able to retire is that idealized state that many people aim for thinking that it would be so easy to live a life of leisure and do nothing at all.  Now, however, I am so busy I don't know how I would actually fit eight hours of work into my hectic day, but it is probably quite different than what most people assume you do when you retire (hint: you won't find me playing golf or lunching with the ladies, I can't afford it!).  Here's how I fill a typical day:Wake up about 8am or 9am (without an alarm clock which is the best part of all).Clean up the house, or in our case as we are traveling, our room.  Do laundry occasionally.Drink my tea while I check email and the other dozen or so websites that I frequent.Shower and get ready to go.Drop hubby off at the casino for his morning poker game.  While he is playing, I will do errands, pick up some groceries, check the mail, etc.Volunteer at my old non profit for a couple of hours on Mondays and Tuesdays.Study Japanese for at least an hour each day, sometimes two, usually in the coffee shop of the casino while he plays (and where I get free beverages. Now if I could just convince them to provide free wi-fi and better lighting I would be set!).Eat lunch with hubby at the casino (they provide a free lunch for poker players so we split his lunch which is plenty for both of us).Go home in the afternoon.  During this time, hubby cooks dinner for the family we are staying with and I update my blogs and websites.In the early evening hubby might play another poker game with his friends or we may go to the movie at the military base ($3 each), watch a concert on the Boardwalk (free), or take a walk on the beach or local trail (also free).If hubby is playing poker with his friends in the early evening, I might meet up with my friends, go to Barnes and Noble and read, stop by the library to get some books, take my friend's kids somewhere (playground, swimming, etc), or work on a project (I'm working on a book v....e...r...y slowly). On the weekend, we tend to look for free activities that are going on in the community.  Last weekend, I did some baking and we went to a potluck birthday party for a niece.  Next weekend there is a community fair which should provide some nice, free entertainment.And this is what I have learned about being job-free:You can't pick up shopping as a hobby or do any other type of expensive hobby since you no longer have the income coming in to support such things.  In our case, our choice is to either live frugally with lots of free entertainment or go back to work in order to afford expensive entertainment.  I choose frugal!By not having a job to go to every day, I save a LOT of money.  No more work wardrobe, no more filling up the gas tank every few days to drive to far away meetings, no more morning (and afternoon!) Starbucks runs, no more designer everything to show off to my co-workers, no more business lunches out at fancy restaurants.Since we have a super flexible schedule, we can do lots of interesting things at the drop of a hat.  In Atlanta, we ended up staying a few extra months when the opportunity presented itself.  When my sister-in-law asked if we wanted to go to Las Vegas if she provided free transportation and lodging we quickly jumped at the opportunity.  We didn't hear about the party last weekend until the last minute but with no real schedule, we could drop what we were doing and go.I still do like working however, and eventually I may open another business.  I am also looking forward to the possibility of working some short-term jobs in Las Vegas (there are a lot of conventions such as the Consumer Electronics Show and World Series of Poker that hire vendors for short-term jobs for the duration of the event--I think it would be super interesting to work with such diverse groups of people), but I have come to the conclusion, however, that the American Dream isn't all it is cracked up to be.  By downsizing our lives considerably, getting rid of the 9-5 job, getting rid of the big house and yard and 2.6 cars in the driveway, we have been able to enjoy so many more interesting opportunities.  I would highly recommend \"retirement\" to everyone."},
{"title": "Free Weekend Activities", "date": "Friday, July 15, 2011", "text": "One of the great things about the Pacific Northwest is that most weekends during the summer, there are lots of things going on, many of them free.  I guess since it tends to rain most of the year here, everyone makes a mad scramble to get things done on the few weekends when it is technically supposed to be sunny (although this weekend looks like it will be decidedly cloudy).   Here's what I plan to do:Take a 10k walk with the local Volksmarch club.  While I can pay $3 to get \"credit\" towards awards with the club, you can also walk for free with them if you like.  Right now I am not aiming for an award so this will be free.There will be a community Gay Pride festival that, whether or not you happen to be gay, is always fun, free, and entertaining.  We will probably stop by in the afternoon and see what's going on there.By checking the local newspaper, I found out that the local utility company will offer a 'bring ten incandescent light bulbs in and trade them for ten free fluorescent bulbs' event.  I told the family we are staying with about this and we will probably stop by there as we make our rounds tomorrow.There are a couple of farmers markets in the area and an art festival this weekend which are always fun to browse through.The local military base is offering a free first run movie which we may or may not decide to watch (these free movies are usually packed with people so I usually just opt to wait until it comes out on DVD).The Bite of Seattle is this weekend and while it is not free, it is pretty entertaining not to mention there is so much great food! (unfortunately there are also hundreds of thousands of people and I am nit much for crowds so this plan is up in the air as well).J A Jance will be at our local Barnes and Noble signing her books (I am guessing there will be a big crowd for this as well) but again, it is another free event.  What are you doing this weekend?  With a bit of research you may be able to find all kinds of fun, free stuff to do too!"},

{"title": "Preparing for Disaster Series (Part 7 of 10): Extended Illness", "date": "Sunday, July 10, 2011", "text": "Unfortunately, one of the disasters that we are most likely to experience, whether for us or a loved one, is an extended illness.  I've run out of fingers and toes needed to count how many people I know who have been diagnosed with cancer, been in a major car wreck which takes months and months to recuperate from, or been struck with some other type of chronic disease (hepatitis, MS, etc).  At least with many other types of disasters, you are in prime physical shape to deal with the fall out (job loss, lack of money, for example). BUT, when you are the one who is struck down with some terrible physical condition, not only do you have to deal with the challenges of daily life (keeping a paycheck coming in and keeping the kids fed) but you also have to deal with treatment/recovery which is a full time job in itself!  Here's some ways to prepare for the possibility of an extended illness:You need health insurance, disability insurance, and life insurance.  Just the cost of these various types of insurances is enough to scare most healthy people away but when you become ill and can't work for a period of time, or worse, you suffer a lengthy illness then die leaving your family to pick up the pieces, having comprehensive insurance coverage will be worth it's weight in gold.You need an emergency fund.  Unfortunately these days, many people barely have a job. Forget about a job that will pay them lengthy sick leave benefits at their full rate.  An emergency fund (the bigger the better) can help keep the bills paid and food in the cupboards in the event that you are out of work for months.A giant stockpile of food is helpful in many types of disasters...and this is one of them.  If you suddenly find yourself unable to work (or worse--unable to leave the hospital) at least having a couple month's worth of food in the pantry to keep the kids fed is a great idea.  This is where \"extreme couponing\" comes in handy.It's a good idea to build a solid social support network now, before you need it.  In the \"olden days\" your social network was kind of built in with lots of local family, neighbors, and friends.  Now that people are so transient, family may be thousands of miles away and unable to help out much if you become home-bound.  With family, neighbors, friends, and co-workers that you can count on (and they know that they can count on you) suffering a lenghty illness or recuperation means you won't be suffering alone.If you are the only one in the family who cooks, cleans, does laundry, or takes care of the other minute of every day life, start spreading the work around.  A friend of mine was suddenly hospitalized with a serious illness which took months to recuperate from.  We, her friends, were kind of astonished that neither her husband nor teenage kids had the slightest idea how to cook (they ended up eating out a lot), do laundry (we gave them a few lessons), deal with the banking, set dental appointments, or do any of the other hundreds of tasks that she had always done for them but was suddenly unable to do.  It was a learning experience for everyone.Have a bag of emergency supplies (an overnight bag with toiletries and a change of clothes) ready to grab at a moment's notice.  This has been mentioned in other posts in this series but it works for an extended illness as well.  What usually happens is that someone is in a serious accident or they are at the hospital when they find themself suddenly admitted and the rest of the family is called and hurries over.  It is much easier to grab the pre-prepared bag then try to figure out what to pack in the midst of anguish and grief.Have your papers in order.  This is another pre-planning step that you need to do before you suddenly are unable to do it.  Having things like an updated Will, Living Will, and medical power of attorney prepared ahead of time will greatly help whoever is there to take care of you.Take care of your health starting today!  Many extended illnesses (heart disease, stroke, etc) are the result of years of bad living.  By doing what you can--such as exercising daily, eating a healthy diet, and being proactive in your health care--you can lessen the possibility of suffering from many of the extended/chronic illnesses that have become so common in our society.Make a \"how to\" book.  This is a good idea but many people feel overwhelmed even beginning such a task.  This book should give complete instructions for how someone else can step into your life and basically take over where you left off.  Everything should be covered here from instructions about your children (the name of their school and teacher, their Social Security number and birthdate, allergies, etc) to your information (banking info, investments, personal info, etc) to list of assets (type of car and VIN number) to usernames and passwords to your online accounts.  Here's a good form to get you started.Make your home relatively user-friendly.  One thing I've noticed most often when someone is seriously ill or injured is the difficulty they have with actually coming home from the hospital or rehab.  Usually their home is so cluttered that it takes a major cleaning effort to get enough stuff out of the way to make room for their hospital bed/wheelchair/supplies.  What once was a perfectly functioning home suddenly becomes loaded with obstacles--from stairs to door widths to overflowing rooms to uneven terrain between the parking area and front door to the many other things that can make a home not so wheel-chair friendly.  While you don't want to live in a sparse home based on the remote possibility of your future disability, decluttering occasionally is still a good idea.While none of us really wants to contemplate being disabled and dependant on others, there is still a statistical probability that such a thing could happen in your lifetime so take this opportunity to get prepared now."},

Eeekk.  If you know what I am doing wrong, please let me know.A quick tip: it is a good idea to scan every document you may ever need into your computer.  I have the basics scanned into my computer and I keep a copy of my documents on a USB drive so I can easily access a copy of my passport, driver's license, etc.  But now that the mortgage company needs other documents (hubby's military retirement forms, tax forms, closing documents from our last house, copies of W2s, etc) I had a heck of a time finding these documents (they are stuffed into our storage shed).  Needless to say, after unburying them from the shed, I have now scanned them into my computer in case I ever need them again.Thank goodness for relatives who live all over the place and graciously take us in for indeterminate amounts of time!  We are currently staying with another of hubby's cousins (he literally has HUNDREDS) in Seattle where we will wait until we find out if our offer on the condo has been accepted and/or go on our next trip.  Our general M.O. is to settle into our room, run to the local Dollar Store or Walmart to buy the things we can't bring on an airline (shampoo, toothpaste, lotion, etc), then commence cooking (hubby) and cleaning (me) for whoever is hosting us.  It's a win-win situation for all of us!The picture above is one of the first things I saw when we arrived in Seattle.  Not sure how I can stand to move away from such a beautiful place...and then I think of the cold, rainy weather during the winter..."},
{"title": "And This is a Picture of My New Condo...", "date": "Sunday, July 3, 2011", "text": "Well it isn't actually ours yet but yesterday after seeing about a dozen houses and condos for sale in Las Vegas, we made an offer on this two bedroom, two bathroom, 1000 square foot condo which is in a gated community only 15 minutes from The Strip!  We had kind of planned to buy a place eventually but this deal fell in our laps and the timing was actually pretty good too because being permanent house guests is getting old.  We always thought we would find a small house or condo in Seattle, but, as it turned out, we were having a great time in Las Vegas and hubby's cousins (four of them) had bought condos in this development for rentals and one of them mentioned that the condo next to hers was for sale for only $60,000 (sadly they all bought condos here when the price of the exact same units were going for $191,000(!). I took one look at it, thought it was perfect, quickly calculated that the price of the mortgage plus fees would run about $500 PER MONTH and we quickly made an offer.  Hopefully we will hear later this week whether the offer was accepted.  It's kind of a surprising turn of events but I think this will make the perfect \"home base\" for us for a variety of reasons... the monthly cost is super low (lower than anything we could have found in Seattle), relatives live near by so when we are traveling, they can always check in on it for us, it is much smaller than our old house which is exactly what we wanted, and if we decide to live permanently somewhere else, I think it will be a great investment property since our price is $500 per month but it could be rented out monthly for $750+, or weekly to tourists for even more.  Plus, there is always so much going on in Vegas, there are numerous airlines flying to and from the city, often at very low rates, and the cost of living there is pretty low (the cousins were showing me all of their tips of finding discounts and getting the best deals at many places around the city so I figure when we move there I will have plenty to blog about!).  I'll let you know what happens.  Now we are back in Seattle staying with another set of cousins until we figure out what to do next (either go to Japan first or wait until the condo closes, move the stuff out of our storage unit to Las Vegas, then go to Japan),  Just thinking about all of that makes me tired!And of course, Happy 4th of July to you all!!"},
{"title": "We're in Las Vegas!", "date": "Thursday, June 30, 2011", "text": "We made it to Las Vegas!  Here's a picture of the hubby with a couple of famous, multi-millionaire poker players (sorry, I don't follow poker so don't know these people but hubby said they are Jennifer Harmon on the left and Tom Dwan on the right, hubby is in the middle).  Hubby is in seventh heaven and the other many thousands of people in the convention center at the Rio Hotel also look pretty happy to be there.  I wish I could have taken a picture in the convention center because there are literally thousands and thousands of people playing poker simultaneously which is an amazing sight.  They have games going 24 hours a day and the tournament will run from May 31st to July 7th.  We are only staying for a week for hubby to try to win enough money for a seat in the finals (he plays $125 tournaments in hopes of winning $1000 so he can play in even bigger tournaments in hopes of winning $10,000 for the main event. He would probably have to pry the $10,000 entry fee out of my hands, however, because that is A LOT of money to put down for a one shot chance of winning against thousands of other people!).  Here's some financials:We are staying in my sister in law's condo so our lodging is free.We did end up renting a car because they are using their car.  Note: in the past we always declined rental car insurance because our full coverage car insurance covered rental cars however a while back we dropped down to just liability because our car was getting older. Now it is costing us an extra $20 a day just for car insurance through the rental company--if I would have known that I would have reinstated full coverage insurance on our car so we wouldn't have to pay such exorbitant fees!!For food we eat breakfast in the condo (bought at the grocery store) to save money.  Lunch so far has been at cheap, off-strip Asian restaurants, and dinners have been two-for-one coupon deals so we haven't spent much on food.I have lost $20 so far which is about my limit.  Hubby is down $80 in the last three days and my brother in law is down around $4000 (yikes!).  Hubby has a limit of about $60 a day for live game so he really tries to make it last.My friend is taking me to look at houses today.  We have tossed around the idea of having a permanent home base somewhere and the houses here are super cheap so I want to check them out and see what's available.The condo place charges $40 a week for internet access and with that, only one person can be online at a time so I have been getting free internet access at McDonalds and Starbucks (note you can sit in the parking lot and still get the free wi-fi signal!).Other free stuff we have enjoyed: free dancing at the casinos, a free photo at Binions, free slot spins, free handouts for signing up for free casino players club cards.Also, it's been around 105 degrees each day since we got here--that's hot!!That's all for now!"},

I booked our flight for this evening which, if I would have thought about it, I would have done differently.  Evenings in tropical climates often bring thunderstorms which often delay flights and I (duh) forgot all about that.Just as I thought, I somehow had less to pack when leaving than when we first arrived.  This is due to sending a couple of flat rate boxes of stuff I didn't want to my niece, having my sister in law take a suitcase of our stuff to Seattle when she worked there last week, and mailing one last flat rate box of stuff we didn't need to our mailing address today where we will pick it up week after next (we figured the $10 flat rate box was less than the $50 it would cost to check a suitcase through to our final destination).  We're going to miss the beautiful weather, the free rent (!), and the great food here!  It will be wonderful to meet up with friends in Las Vegas that I haven't seen in a while.Friends back in Seattle already have plans for me when I get there as well.  And my oddest realization...You know how people think that if they had a few months of having absolutely nothing to do and no responsibilities, they could do all kinds of great things (write a novel, exercise every day, learn a new language, etc)? I used to think that but I found that during our last four months here with absolutely nothing to do and no responsibilities I really didn't accomplish much of anything.  I guess for me, I get much more done when I am already busy (that whole 'objects in motion tend to stay in motion, objects at rest tend to stay at rest' thing I guess)."},

{"title": "A Few Words About Cremation", "date": "Thursday, June 23, 2011", "text": "Yep, you read that right. I like to write about things that are happening right now so today's subject is cremation. The topic came about because nine years ago when my mother-in-law died, her body was cremated and half of her ashes went to the hubby and half to the sister we are staying with now. When the SIL was in Seattle last week she was able to pick up a Chinese-style altar that we left for her at her son's house (it's the first picture, above, and came from our house when we moved everything out). Anyway, the altar is now here and hubby was going to set it up for her then he noticed that his sister's part of his mom's ashes were still in the box they came in from the crematorium. So off we went yesterday in search of something to put the ashes in. What we found (which is similar to what we found for our half of the ashes) was a pretty box from TJ Maxx that you can see in the second picture. Which brings us to the few things I wanted to say about cremation:Most of the people in both of our families feel that cremation is a good thing. It is much less expensive than burial and much less hassle for all involved.The couple of down sides is that first, you have to decide who keeps the ashes (and then what happens after they pass?), and the second is that there is no actual place for loved ones to go a visit like a cemetery (although you can inter ashes in special places set up just for this at some cemeteries).You don't need to spend an arm and a leg on an urn. Obviously some people will feel differently about this and think that only an \"official\" urn is sacred enough for ashes but for us, finding a pretty box for the ashes and placing them on an altar (I learned about altars when traveling in Asia and thought it was a very cool idea) is reverent enough."},
{"title": "Preparing for Disaster Series (Part 6 of 10): Divorce", "date": "Wednesday, June 22, 2011", "text": "A common disaster which many people don't prepare for is divorce. It's interesting that 50% of US marriages end in divorce yet this is one type of disaster that no one prepares for (I guess if you did go into marriage preparing for divorce, it would kind of take the fun out of the whole thing!). So, while hopefully you stay married for a good long time (hubby and I have made it 25 year so far!), there are some things that everyone should be aware of in the event of a divorce.Be debt free. Much like if a spouse dies, being debt free takes a lot of financial pressure off of both parties in the event of divorce. The last thing you want to do is be reduced to one (or no!) income and be awarded half of the debts.Have a pre-nup. If you both start out with nothing, obviously a pre-nup isn't necessary. However, combining a couple with one or two giant incomes and/or lots of inherited money and property, pretty much dictates that some sort of agreement gets put in place before the wedding in order to protect both parties financially as well as their heirs. Unromantic? Totally. Financially savvy? Totally.Do the whole pre-marriage counseling thing before you get married. Since money problems account for nearly half of all divorces, you would think people would want to have some pretty clear discussions about finances before they get married. This usually isn't true, however, because talking about money is uncomfortable and can be contentious and when you are blissed out in love, the last thing you want to do is upset the apple cart. It really does pay to discuss financial goals, rules about spending and saving, and future money issues (what happens when kids arrive, how will you help your family financially, etc) before the wedding.Both the husband and wife should be 100% involved in the family finances. Both should know how much money is coming in and from what sources, how much money is going out and to whom, and how much is being saved and where the savings are kept. Each spouse should have their own mini emergency fund (around $1000) as well as their own \"no strings\" spending money each month. Secrets about any of these things can lead to divorce (ever try to keep a mistress when they wife knows here every penny goes?) and can lead to problems divvying up the estate after a divorce (a friend of mine had no clue about any of these things even after being married almost 20 years which made it that much more difficult--and expensive--for her attorney).When marriage problems crop up, and they always do, fix them immediately either with some knock-down, drag-out conversations or a marriage counselor. Many times people know there is a problem in their marriage but it is just easier to act out than to fix the problem. Note that acting out usually has financial repercussions for the family--like the wife continually running up her credit cards to improve her self esteem and/or get back at her husband, and the husband going out and buying a boat without even consulting his wife.Consider divorce seriously before acting. Divorce is never easy (you couldn't pay me enough to work in the drama that is family court!) but many people think it is a simple answer to their marriage problems. Obviously you shouldn't stay miserable for your entire life but if a marriage can be fixed it should. Getting divorced will cut your household income dramatically and up your household bills exponentially (you never have to put a price tag on raising kids until you start paying child support). Divorce can also impact health insurance benefits, life insurance benefits, Social Security income, and income tax breaks among other things.Both spouses should always #1--have their own emergency fund, #2--be able to earn their own income, #3--have friends they can turn to for support, #4--know their rights concerning separation and divorce.When it comes down to getting divorced, remember: never use the kids for leverage or to bring messages to the other person because you don't want to talk to them, a lawyer will be expensive and a good lawyer will be even more expensive, a heavily contested divorce will make you poor and your lawyer rich so try to play fair and work out as many details of the divorce as possible, don't obsess over your soon to be ex to the point of stalking/violence/other bad behavior...it isn't worth it.No matter who instigates the divorce, you will both be emotional disasters for a while...some longer than others. There is no quick way to get over a divorce except for time. You need to give yourself enough time, coupled with enough distraction (like work, exercising, caring for your kids, etc) to grieve the death of your marriage.Some technical after divorce stuff: changing titles on your car and house, refinancing the house into one or the other's name, changing beneficiaries on life insurance, changing coverages on health insurance, closing joint bank accounts and opening individual bank accounts, ditto for credit cards/investment accounts, updating your will and Power of Attorney, separating out business things if you jointly owned a business,"},

Since we have been here in Atlanta for a little over four months, hubby has acquired quite a few things (he is the pack rat in the family) but I think I actually have less than what I arrived with (I am the minimalist...plus I have sent three boxes of clothes and shoes to my niece in the time we have been here). So I thought I would list everything I have with me. Here's everything I am packing up:A carry on-sized suitcase and a backpackFour pairs of shoes (tennis shoes, flip flops, sandals, high heels)Clothes: seven pairs of pants, 24 tops (not really as much as it seems since most are tank tops and others are small, gauzy tops that don't take up much space), three pairs shorts and three old t shirts to sleep in, bathing suit, North Face jacket, warm up jacket, scarf, seven bras, twelve undies, six pair sox\"Officey\" stuff: passport, tiny notebook, playing cards, sewing kit, three ziploc bags, mini Sharpie marker, small whistle, couple of rubber banks, couple of safety pins, tiny flashlight, key chain with car key on it, five blank checks (haven't used a single check since we left as I pay everything online), one stampFirst aid kit: bandaids, aspirin packets, Thera Flu, alcohol wipes, antibiotic cream, moleskinToiletry kit: nail clippers, nail file, hair pins, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant, razor, lotion, suntan lotion, noxzema, tampons, tissue packet, tweezers, mirror, flossTech stuff: Canon Powershot camera, camera charger, spare memory card, two spare USB drives, cell phone and charger cord, Sansa MP3 player and earbuds, 15\" Toshiba laptop and cord, mouse, Flip camcorder Other stuff: jewelry (one pair earrings, five bracelets), tiny fold-up tote bag, purse-ish totebag, sunglasses, wallet with ID and debit cards, pen, small notebook, change purse with lots of change, small calendar book, Japanese language textbook, notebook, small make up bag (comb, eyeliner, brow liner, lipstick, powder, concealer)And that's all. Besides the few things we are using here (towels, washcloths, TV, bedding, a place to do laundry and a place to cook and eat) that is literally all I need to survive...not much once you really look at the list. Obviously in your own home you won't have such a minimal number of possessions but if you really need to cut back (ie: stop shopping and/or sell a lot of the stuff that you own) it is good to know that to actually live on a day to day basis, you really don't need much stuff."},

In other words, our expenses have been nearly nil for four whole months and now we are going to be on our own! Yikes!I finally got all of my blogs and websites in some semblance of order.

I have been following the Family on Bikes since they first hit the road almost four years ago to ride their bicycles from northern Alaska to the southern-most point of South America. Their blog was great and when you read about people nearly daily for so long, you kind of feel like you know them. So this weekend when they were giving a presentation near where we are staying Georgia, I showed up just to meet them. It's kind of weird to have never met someone but know all about them (\"hi, I'm your blog stalker...you've never met me but I know all about your son's toe problems and the new house you are buying...\" weird huh?). But Nancy was sooo nice! In fact the whole family was so nice! After the presentation Nancy and I went for coffee and it was like we had known each other for ages. This was actually the first time I had ever met someone from \"online\" so it was a pretty amazing experience.Finally, a belated Father's Day to all of you dads out there!!!"},

{"title": "Preparing for Disaster Series (Part 5 or 10): Natural Disaster", "date": "Tuesday, June 14, 2011", "text": "When people talk about preparing for disaster, this is usually the topic they are thinking about--natural and man-made disasters such as an earthquake, tornado, hurricane, major winter storm, flooding, etc. Fortunately, these things don't happen often but when they do, you need to be prepared ahead of time. Here's how:Always keep enough food, bottled water, and other important items stored in your home for use in an emergency. If you can't get out or all of the stores in the area are closed for an extended period, this is what you will have to live on until things get back to normal. (Note: be sure to include items such as medications, baby formula, baby diapers, adult diapers, pet food, and any other specialized items that you can't live without).Review your insurance coverages. Many people are surprised to find that their home and auto insurance won't cover things like floods, hurricane damage, earthquake damage, etc. Be sure that your insurance covers these things and/or get specialized riders for natural disasters that are common to your area such as hurricanes and earthquakes.Have a selection of emergency items in your home for use before, during, and after a disaster. These would include but aren't limited to: NOAA radio, wrench to turn off the gas, a flashlight for each family member, extra batteries, matches, camping gear, a first aid kit, etc.During certain disasters, you may have to evacuate so each member of the family should have their own bag of emergency gear that they can grab and go with only a few moment's notice. This bag should include a change of clothes, shoes, food, water, toiletry kit, etc.Know what the most likely disasters are in your area and in the areas you are visiting. Right after we arrived in Atlanta, there were tornado warnings blasting across the TV screen. We had no idea where we were in relation to the warnings and we had no idea what to do if a tornado was coming our way since these are virtually unheard of in Seattle. A little bit of Googling will give you pages and pages of information on how to prepare for disasters that are likely to hit your area and what to do during and after such disasters.Get in the disaster knowledge loop so you will receive warnings of possible disasters that are heading your way. This can be done in a number of ways. Our local Department of Emergency Management has a place on their website where people in the area can sign up for email/text/phone call warnings that are sent out when a disaster is imminent. You can also sign up here for alerts and warnings. You may also want to bookmark websites that would be useful during disasters that are likely in your area such as this and this.Hold regular practices with your family. These should include fire drills, lockdown drills, communication planning and drills, earthquake drills, tornado drills, etc. Plans and ideas for holding these drills can be found by Googling these topics.Plan for a disaster. Do you have a plan for who would stay with your kids if you can't get home? A plan for helping out elderly neighbors and relatives after a disaster? A plan for sheltering outside if your home becomes unlivable? A plan for your pets if you need to evacuate? Think of a variety of disaster scenarios then think of how you would react in those situations.Learn skills that would be useful during a disaster. Many communities have first aid classes for the public, HAM radio clubs offer lots of info and classes on using these radios during a disaster, your local Search and Rescue generally needs volunteers and provides excellent training for how to respond after a disaster, and even simple skills such as fishing, hunting, foraging for wild food, and growing your own garden can be very useful in the event of a major disaster.Learn about your community. It is a good idea to find out ahead of time: where your community disaster shelters are, where the evacuation routes out of your city are, where there are alternative sources of water that you could use after a disaster (be sure to know how to purify it!), where local sources of food are (ie: parks that have fruit or nut trees), what tsunami or tornado warnings sound like if these are available in your community, etc. Resources:FEMA72 HoursReady.govThe Epicenter"},
{"title": "More Links and Other Useful Information", "date": "Monday, June 13, 2011", "text": "Hmm..two links posts in a row. Oh well...this is what I have been doing today:I'm a big fan or reddit. Here's two threads that you might find useful, one a giant list of great free software (was included in yesterday's post), and the second, lots of info on how to live on $11 an hour.I'm trying to figure out the MAC flight system so we can book our flight to Asia in August or September. MAC/SpaceA flights are free flights that people who are active duty or retired military can take advantage of. The disadvantage is that you need to be really flexible because you never know when or if you will get on a flight since active duty people with orders and military equipment takes precedence over lower category people like us retired folks. Basically you go to the airport or air base and wait and see if they can fit you in, if they can't you go back home and try again at a later time. On the positive side, this system can save you literally thousands and thousands of dollars if you like to travel overseas. Here's where to sign up.I was going to buy some white strips and whiten my teeth up a bit before we leave here but they cost over $20! So I went to Google where I found this information on how to use hydrogen peroxide to white teeth (and save about $19.50 in the process!).Now that I am carrying around a big bag (this purse) my change tends to rattle around in the bottom of it. At the store I found a cute change purse but it cost $15 (!). The hubby and I then walked next door to the Dollar Store and found a travel toothbrush/toothpaste kit for $1. I gave hubby the toothbrush and toothpaste and kept the bag it came in for my change purse! See photo above.Finally, I started yet another blog, mainly to keep things better organized. In addition to this blog and my travel blog, I now have a tech blog which you can find here."},

{"title": "Wish Listing", "date": "Saturday, June 11, 2011", "text": "I am trying to get everything ready to go since we will only be in Atlanta for another couple of weeks. Even though I didn't bring much, it seems like my stuff has multiplied--where it all came from I have no idea! So I am sending a bag of stuff back to Seattle with my sister-in-law who will be working there next week and I am also sending a box of clothes to a niece. Now I have to replenish my stuff and make it \"Vegas appropriate\" (most of the stuff I brought here was for lounging not for going out dancing!). Of course my dilemma is the rather small amount of money I have for doing this. If I had a lot of money, it would be really easy to just hit the mall and start shopping but I have a super tight budget. Since I only use cash, there is no charging things and paying for it later. Since I want to save as much cash as possible, I need to stretch my meager funds as much as possible. In order to do this, I do what I call \"wish listing\".I am a \"listy\" person anyway. If I don't write things down I will immediately forget it so it is just a habit to write down stuff I want, stuff I need to do, stuff I need to get at the grocery store, etc. With wish listing, I write down everything I want and need in my notebook. I add as much detail as possible to each item so I can have a clear picture in my mind of what I want. Then I prioritize my list by how much/how soon I need the item.This is what my wish list looked like yesterday:Tennis shoes. Asics. (I like this brand but they are usually on the expensive side--$60-$100 a pair).A cute tote bag for carrying my netbook, small purse, and jacket. Coach. (I have a vision of a big Coach carry-all type of bag. I also have a vision of it being very expensive).I have other things on the list like a book for my brother in law and a new battery for my netbook but these things can wait a week or so, and I have had some things on my wish list for ages but when it comes to prioritizing the items, they always end up at the bottom (for example, I would like a new North Face rain coat but I already have two perfectly good NF jackets so this isn't a priority). I also need some cute clothes but I figure I will pick these up as I see them come on sale. Plus, I want to check the Goodwill and Value Village for pants and shirts because while I like new, name brand shoes and bags, I don't mind buying used clothes (I even think they feel more comfortable than new clothes!).So I headed to Ross and TJ Maxx yesterday hoping to find the purse and tennis shoes that I wanted but had no luck. Then I went to the mall not expecting to find much because it is usually way more expensive at the mall than Ross and TJ Maxx. At the last store that I checked at the mall, I found the perfect pair of pink Asics tennis shoes. They were on sale for $39.95 but when I went to the register they rang up for $34 so that was an extra little bonus.I still didn't know what to do about the Coach bag. Did I really really want a new bag? Yes, of course. Did I think there was absolutely no way I could find the bag for under $200? Unfortunately, yes. So, even while I may have a specific bag on my wish list, sometimes reality takes over and then I have to consider a compromise. If I was to get the bag, that would leave me with much less money for the other things I need to get. Fortunately, I came across a cute bag at H&M just as the hubby came to meet me at the mall (note: it saves me quite a bit of money shopping with the hubby trailing along behind me saying \"you don't need that! Annoying, but money saving). He pointed out a lot of reasons why I should get this bag instead of spending a lot of money on the Coach bag that I wanted, namely, it only cost $25, I go through bags--name brand or not--with amazing speed (and then I either give them away or Ebay them), that if he wins in Vegas he will give me the cash to buy a new bag, that this way I would still have money left over for clothes instead of taking my old clothes with me to Vegas, and that this bag was the perfect size for what I needed it for and stylish too (the hubby knows more about designer purses and stylish clothes than I do!). So I bought the bag (above) and am happy with it.The moral of the story is that my wish list worked just as it always does. I found the things I wanted, on sale no less, and with a little compromise, I am really happy with how this shopping trip turned out!"},
{"title": "Update...Or What We Are Doing Now", "date": "Wednesday, June 8, 2011", "text": "Here's what we are up to now...We will be in Atlanta for another couple of weeks and are really enjoying our time here. Last weekend we drove through the Smoky Mountains which were beautiful and I tried boiled peanuts for the first time which were yummy!Our next stop--for sure since we already have our tickets--will be Las Vegas for the last week of June. Hubby and the brother-in-law will be doing the World Series of Poker tournament. Depending on how well they do we could leave when our tickets say or we could end up staying for three or four weeks until the end of the tournament (if we need up staying until the end of the tournament that's a good thing--it means he will place in the money. First place is around $8 MILLION dollars!)We are scheduled to be back in Seattle for the 4th of July! I will be happy to catch up with my friends. We talk on the phone and keep in touch via FaceBook but I feel so \"out of the loop\" so I am really looking forward to seeing them!Our future plans (subject to change...usually about every other day) include: going to Japan in August instead of September as planned. House sitting for a cousin in Seattle for the month of September. Going to Connecticut for the month of October (for another poker tournament, the World Poker Tour). And going to the Philippines in November. Of course our plans keep changing so who knows. We were going to spend the rest of the summer in Seattle (the most beautiful time of year there) but a cousin wanted us to house sit so we decided to move up our Japan travel plans which may or may not work out (we get free flights to Asia via the military but as retirees, we are in the very lowest category which means we get on the plane if and when all of the active duty, active duty dependants, baggage, and military gear gets on and there is still enough room to squeeze us in...it's kind of a hit or miss thing but it is FREE which is great).I'm really feeling like I want a home again. I have been looking at home prices and now seems like a great time to buy...we just don't know where. Seattle is nice but prices are a bit higher and the gloomy weather for six months of the year is a bummer. Atlanta is nice (I love the hot, humid weather) but they have had so many tornado watches while we have been here I'm not sure if I want to live in tornado alley (but home prices are super low here). We are going to look at houses in Las Vegas while we are there because prices are so low and with hubby being a poker player, he will be right in the middle of the action. I am not, however, a fan of hot, dry, deserty places. Finally, family keeps telling us to move to Connecticut where most of the family lives but there are quite a few downsides including higher home prices, cold, snowy winters (two days of snow like Seattle gets on occasion is OK, two weeks or two months of snow is not OK), and higher taxes.On the business side, I am bored silly. After six months of not working, all I can think about is starting a business and making some money. Again, where we settle will have an impact on this as well. In Seattle, I have a lot of business contacts which could really help with new projects. In Las Vegas I have heard the business climate is not so good (rumor only so I will need to check this out), Atlanta seems to have a pretty good business climate but I will have to literally start from the ground up since I know exactly two people in this entire city, and Connecticut would be a happy medium between Seattle and Atlanta because many of our family members are business owners so at least I would know some people there to help me get started.Finally, the siren call of materialism has been trying to catch my attention lately. Or maybe I am tired of wearing the same four pairs of pants and same four pairs of shoes that I brought with me when we started traveling in February. I want some beautiful clothes, some beautiful shoes, and a couple of nice designer handbags (I just don't have room to carry all of this stuff around the country with us!). Then I was in TJ Maxx a few days ago and all of their home and kitchen decor looked so beautiful, but then I have a flashback to selling everything in our home for pennies on the dollar and decide that I need to find a happy--and inexpensive--medium between having nice things and the money that it costs to buy these things.That's about it for now.

{"title": "Preparing for Disaster Series (Part 4 of 10): People Problems", "date": "Monday, June 6, 2011", "text": "One type of disaster that can sneak up on you when you least expect it is problems caused by other people. You can be living your life, happy as a clam, financially stable, and secure in your preparedness then \"BAM!\" someone calls you with a problem that while it isn't your problem, they may want to make it so. Here are our ten rules for dealing with people problems:We never co-sign for anything for any one. This includes but is not limited to: cell phone contracts, cars, mortgages, loans, credit cards, student loans, etc.We do keep a separate emergency fund to help others if needed. There isn't a lot in this fund but with a giant family, it is pretty much a given that someone will need help and if we are so inclined, then at least we will have the money on hand.We don't loan money to anyone for anything. If we have the money to offer and we feel it is a worthy cause we will gladly offer it as a gift but we never loan money then expect to get it back because past experience has shown that this only leads to disappointment and relationship drama.We don't bail people out of jail. This rule was instituted when the boys became teenagers. Our feeling was that if you got arrested you were most likely at fault no matter what the Miranda warning says and if you choose to do something illegal you can sit in jail until you can work the problem out with the judge.We won't buy from your MLM business, go to a presentation that is trying to sell us something, become one of your MLM \"downlinks\", or otherwise enter into a \"great business opportunity\" with anyone.I won't enter into a business partnership with anyone. I have seen way too many business partnerships crash and burn to think this is a good idea. I will, however, provide you information, moral support, consulting if it is within the realm of my business expertise, and otherwise support you into your new business if you would like.The hubby and I freely provide: someone to vent to/talk to, a free meal if you stop by the house, a place to sleep in an emergency, a free ride if you have been drinking, moral support, useful information, help with a wide variety of problems/projects if we have the time, and provide other non-financial assistance whenever possible.We won't sell you anything on credit. Mostly this involves the sale of cars and other larger items that people may not have the money for. Trying to collect the money a year down the line on more than one occasion in one of these deals has turned us off of this permanently.We don't take sides and we don't like drama. Having a big family and lots of friends, there is bound to be drama between people and families from time to time. We like to stay \"above it all\" as firstly, we don't like drama, gossip, or rumors; secondly, unless a person has earned our wrath personally, there are always multiple sides to an issue; thirdly, we live far enough away from the bulk of the family to be able to stay out of local dramas; and fourthly, these things usually work themselves out eventually so we will just wait. And stay neutral. Like Switzerland.We treat people how we would like to be treated, namely, with honor, respect, patience, humor, and firm parameters so as to avoid miscommunications and other inter-personal issues. We expect the same in return."},

{"title": "Preparing for Disaster Series (Part 3 of 10): Job Loss", "date": "Thursday, June 2, 2011", "text": "Continuing on in our series about ways to prepare financially for the most common types of disasters that you may face in your lifetime, today we will look at how you can prepare ahead for job loss.A decade ago, losing a job was a big deal but, for many people, all you had to do was dust yourself off and go get another job. These days that has changed quite a bit as over the past few years people have lost their jobs and there are literally no comparable (paying) jobs to be had. Scary. Here's ten ways to prepare yourself now for the possibility of losing your job.Have an emergency fund. Notice how this is the common denominator of ALL of the preparedness plans? With an emergency fund of six to twelve months worth of expenses in savings you will be able to give yourself quite a financial cushion if you should suddenly lose your job.Have six months to a year's worth of food in storage. It seems like a lot but there are a few reasons for this. First, if you find yourself the host of an impromptu family gathering, you can easily pull out enough food to feed everyone, often without even having to run to the store. Second, in the event of a major natural disaster when the stores shut down, you will be fine holed up with your stash of food. Finally, if you find yourself in the middle of an extended job layoff and you only have to pick up perishables once a week instead of ALL of the groceries your family needs, you will be able to save a lot of money (and stress!). Consider watching 'Extreme Couponing' then begin your stock up plan.Be amazing at your current job. I have hired people away from other jobs simply because I saw them working and they were AMAZING. Great work, great attitude, great people skills...think of how you currently conduct yourself at you job as a never ending job interview. People who do a great job tend to be noticed (and sought after!).Be aware of what is happening in your job and in your industry. Often job loss shouldn't come as a surprise because there are a number of clues in the months leading up to termination that should scream \"there won't be a job here much longer!\" Clues can range from the internal--your boss is bouncing checks like a mad man, to the external--the housing market is circling the drain so if you are even remotely in this industry it may be time to jump ship.Know what benefits you are entitled to. When termination is imminent, figure out what you can get on your way out. A 'golden parachute'? That would be nice. Severance pay? Back pay for unused sick time and vacation time? Unemployment? Re-employment training? Take whatever you can get as the time between jobs can be lengthy.Get out of debt and stay out of debt! It is much easier to cover your bills with unemployment or side jobs if the bills are small. If you are drowning in debt, a job layoff will probably push you over the edge to bankruptcy. Ditto with keeping any other debts you have as small as possible. Your house payment should be no more than 25% of the family's income (this way even on one spouse's income the mortgage can get paid), car payments should be as low as possible (actually you should pay cash for cars so you will have NO payment), and sundry items (gas, clothing, cell bills, etc.) should be able to be immediately ratcheted back if necessary.Always be prepared to change jobs at the spur of the moment. Always have your resume updated, network to \"stay in the loop\" in your industry, continue to refine and add to your current job skills, etc. This way, whether you become unemployed or you just run across an amazing job opportunity, you will be ready to bounce.Always have multiple streams of income. I have done this for most of my life and it just makes me feel comfortable. Having side businesses or side jobs is a great way to always have money coming in no matter what your current job status. For example, I know quite a few guys who started in construction trades, became white-collar office workers, yet still keep doing construction-type side jobs (roofing, flooring) both for the extra money it brings in and for the added exercise it provides.Look at other options when the hatchet falls on your job. This is what I did at the end of last year when my biggest business client went toes up. Instead of sticking with the status quo (find another client or another job to replace the income I was losing) we decided to make a radical change (sell the house and sell almost everything else we owned) in order to try something new (traveling and living on one income). Granted not everyone can easily do this but many people have made very radical lifestyle changes (one family decided to live in an RV and travel, another family decided to bike from the North Pole to the South Pole) in order to enjoy opportunities that having a regular job wouldn't have allowed them to do.Don't be afraid to seek help. A job loss is a pretty scary, disorienting thing. If needed, don't be afraid to ask for and seek out what you need whether it is food from the local food pantry, psychological counseling to get you through a rough patch, financial assistance from family and friends, support from your church, or just a hug from your SO. Everyone goes through hard times and everyone deserves a little help now and then just as you help others when you are able to."},
{"title": "Preparing for Disaster Series (Part 2 of 10): Death", "date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2011", "text": "Back in my social service days, death was another disaster my clients had to deal with. Since most of my clients were youngish people, usually with small children, their spouse dying was a HUGE crisis. I mean, when you are young, there are a lot of things to worry about--your finances, getting and keeping a job, taking care of your kids--however someone dying young usually isn't even on the person's radar. But it does happen and the scramble afterwards to take care of funeral arrangements, pay bills, and help people through the grieving process really made me aware of the fact that you can die at any time so this is another area where it pays to be prepared ahead of time. Here's ten things to prepare for right now in case the worst happens:If anyone depends on your income (spouse, kids) be sure to get life insurance (term life insurance is best). I have seen a 55 year old woman who never worked a day in her life have to pick up menial jobs to make ends meet because her husband let his life insurance lapse and then he died, leaving his wife too young to collect social security which basically left her penniless. Fortunately, for young people, life insurance is very inexpensive.Have a Will, Living Will, durable power of attorney, and medical power of attorney. These documents (properly written and notarized of course) make the death and dying process much less complicated. Unless any of these documents could be contested, many states will let you draw up your own documents as long as they are officially notarized. For a bit more protection, you can draw up your own documents to save money then pay an attorney to give them a quick read through to ensure everything is correct.Have an emergency fund! Right after someone dies, there are all kinds of expenses that need to be taken care of, unfortunately it usually takes life insurance a while to pay out so the money in an emergency fund (kept in an account where both spouses can access it) can really help a person through the first few weeks after a death whether to pay bills or pay for funeral arrangements.Discuss your final wishes with your SO. It's kind of an odd conversation to have, especially when you are still strong and healthy, but many people can end up in the poor house when a loved one dies because they guilt themselves into spending way more than necessary on a fancy funeral and burial plot when, if the loved one would have been asked, wouldn't have cared what kind of casket/burial plot location/flowers/etc they got. FWIW, I would rather the hubby keep his money and enjoy it rather than spending it on me when I am dead and can't enjoy it. I told him that if I am practically dead to pull the plug (I'm a fan of compressed morbidity), have me cremated (it's way cheaper than a burial), and to skip the funeral service and have a party to remember me at home (again, as long as he has friends to support him when he is grieving, I'm happy with that...besides, funerals make me sad).Get out of debt ASAP. One of the main reasons I became so focused on getting out of debt was because a lady came to my office one day four months after her husband had died. She had literally never handled the finances and didn't know what to do with the four month's worth of mail she brought me in a giant bag. After sifting through the mail I asked her if she knew they were nearly $100,000 in debt not counting the mortgage. Of course, she didn't know. Her husband always juggled the bills (looking at his mess of bills the stress from juggling these debts probably speeded up his demise!) and she thought everything was fine. Everything wasn't fine and in the midst of her grief she ended up having to file bankruptcy too. That situation really hit me hard and I realized that there was NO WAY I was going to leave my husband with that kind of mess (or vice versa, end up with myself in that kind of mess if he were to die first) which pretty much made me super focused on paying off all of our debt.Know what death benefits you are entitled to. In my case, my husband is a veteran so there are a number of death benefits he is entitled to from the VA. If you have minor children, they are also entitled to death benefits if a parent dies. Searching out all of the benefits you are entitled to can save you a lot of money so it pays to find out what you are entitled to.Have all of your important documents in a single place where both spouses can access them. After someone dies, there is a mountain of paperwork to do. To streamline this process it helps to have all of the family's important documents together in one place (I keep these in a safe as well as keep scanned copies of each document in my computer). Among the documents you need: birth certificates, Wills, powers of attorney, medical power of attorney, adoption records, insurance policies, financial records, list of creditors, marriage records, divorce records, military records, etc. Give stuff to people when you are still living, enjoy people too while you still can. Suffice it to say that seemingly normal people can act like rabid hyenas after the person who held the family together dies. From experience I have learned that it is best to give stuff to people when you are still alive (this ensures things go to who you want them to go to and you get to see them enjoying the things you give them) and I have also learned that it is way more important to spend time with people NOW while you can enjoy them instead of showing up at the funeral wishing you had called/visited your loved one more often.Prepare an \"if I die\" letter. This is probably the last thing people want to think about, especially if you are young and healthy, but I have seen way more than my share of people die in the prime of life so I know that putting such a thing off until later can often be too late. This letter should include things you want to say to your loved ones, advice about what they should do after your passing (ie: how to arrange home matters and business matters), user names and passwords to all of your online accounts (some people even write a final blog post to be published after their death), plus anything else they need to know.Don't forget anything. Before and after death, there can literally be a hundred things that you need to do. In addition to this checklist, here is a bunch of other good lists of things to remember to do both before and after a loved one dies."},
{"title": "We Fixed the Dryer Today Using Google!", "date": "Monday, May 30, 2011", "text": "The SIL's clothes dryer has been acting up a bit since we got here. Lately it has been getting worse so when I mentioned it to the SIL, she said she would call a repairman to fix it. I told her to wait while I Googled the problem to see what it could be (always a good idea, especially when dealing with repairmen because you want to be able to give a good description AND know that they are on the right track when fixing your broken item). I Googled the problem as accurately as possible \"Kenmore Elite HE3 error message E1 stops drying\" and came up with this page. The forum question seemed to describe the problem exactly so I ordered the part online and it came within a few days. With the diagram on the page, it looked easy enough to change out so this morning with replacement part and small toolbox in hand, hubby and I went to work on the dryer. Amazingly it took only a few minutes to change out the part (instead of taking off the duct assembly I was able to reach around behind it and get to the thermistor part to remove and replace it because my hand was small enough to fix back there). Now the dryer is humming along and not shutting off every 10 minutes like it was before. Problem fixed!Moral(s) of this story: Google has an answer for practically everything because someone out in the world has probably needed to fix what you need to fix. Doing things yourself can save a ton of money (the cost for the part was $35 with shipping as opposed to the $100+ a repairman would have charged). Be careful when doing your own work (ie: unplug things so you don't get electrocuted). Also, it's nice to invite a friend over to help if you have no clue what you are doing (we built a house from the ground up with friends years ago, hubby was an electrician years ago, and I used to repair my car often because #1 it was a piece of junk and #2 I couldn't afford to pay anyone to fix it, so this wasn't an overwhelming experience for us. For people who have never done anything mechanical, it would have been kind of intimidating so help from someone who knows what they are doing is nice)."},
{"title": "A Few Things About Goal Setting", "date": "Thursday, May 26, 2011", "text": "It may be serendipity or maybe since I was thinking about my future goals, goal-related things are just on my radar, but all of these things came together today...I stayed up until 2am watching Oprah Winfrey's Master Class last night. If you get the opportunity to watch this two-part series about Oprah's life and her success, please take it. Here words are sooo inspiring and the things she says are sooo insightful it makes you want to go out, be awesome, and conquer the world!I was reading through the blog posts I wrote when I first began this blog in 2009. It is amazing how far I have come since then and it is also amazing that many of the goals that I had written down way back then actually have actually come true. At the time, I wanted to quit work and travel but there was no way in Hell that was going to happen. I was so far in debt that the idea of me quitting work was laughable. Fast forward to today when not only have I quit working, but our biggest problem now is deciding where to travel to next. Lesson: write down your goals and the universe will amaze you by helping you make them come true.I just found out today that I will get to meet one of my favorite bloggers in a couple of weeks. I had the goal \"meet a favorite blogger\" on my list of things to accomplish this year but had no idea where I would find a blogger to meet. Today the Family on Bikes posted on FaceBook that they will be in Atlanta in a couple of weeks and they asked who wanted to meet up with them. I quickly answered back \"ME!\" Yet another example of how writing your goals down somehow opens the door to making them come true!Do you have goals? Do you have them written down? If not, you should. I don't know how it works, but for me, writing my goals down has made amazing things happen that I really believe otherwise would never have come true."},
{"title": "Preparing for Disaster Series (Part 1 of 10): Domestic Violence", "date": "Wednesday, May 25, 2011", "text": "For the next couple of weeks I want to focus on ten scenarios that can have disastrous affects on you as well as your finances. While there is never one sure fire plan to take care of every possible thing that could happen to you, there are a number of things to think of ahead of time that will help you out in the event that a particular disaster happens.For the first part of this series, we will focus on domestic violence. Not only is it a problem that is currently affecting my family (see previous post), but as a former social service provider, this is one of the most common problems people would come to me for help with. In fact, is one of the problems that would bring the widest spectrum of clients to my door--all races, both genders, all ages, those who were rich, poor, or middle income, the well educated and the uneducated...basically no one was immune from this. Here are ten (financial) things to consider if you find yourself in a domestic violence situation:Get help from the experts, preferably for free. The National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-SAFE) is a good resource for general information. You can also call 211 to find local resources for domestic violence help in your community (ie: a DV shelter, DV court advocates, DV counselors, etc).Have an emergency fund. Unlike most people who keep an emergency fund with their spouse, this one you want to keep without your spouse's knowledge. Financial control is one of the most common ways that abusers control their victims. You may want to keep cash hidden in your house (may be difficult to access if you need to leave in a hurry), leave cash with a trusted friend or relative (make sure they won't spend it!), or open your own bank account (choose a different bank than you and your SO usually use, don't accept an ATM card for the account, and make sure the statements are only provided to you electronically or sent to a friend's house). You want to bulk up this fund up as much as possible, even if that means you can only put $10 a month in taken out of the grocery fund. Also, since without at ATM card you can't access your bank account on weekends, be sure to keep a little cash on hand to use until you can get to the bank.Keep all of your important documents on hand or, as abusers also use holding your documents as a method of control, scan them into your computer and keep copies of them on a hidden thumb drive. You want to scan the entire family's documents (yours, hubby's, kids) and want to include birth certificates, driver's licenses, passports, military records, list of financial assets, etc. This will help you sign up for emergency social services (food stamps, welfare) as well as provide necessary information for your attorney.Develop a circle of friends. Often abuse victims are isolated by their abuser to the point that they will have no one to turn to for help. If possible, let a few people know about your situation and find out if you can count on them if necessary. These people may include trusted co-workers, family members, people from church, or neighbors. Friends will be able to help with a range of things including hiding you until you can get help, taking care of your kids, giving you money, giving you a place to leave important items, etc.Keep a bag of emergency escape supplies in an easy to access place. You want a bag that includes a change of clothes, basic toiletries, a list of emergency phone numbers in case the abuser takes your phone, some cash, spare car and house keys, a thumb drive with your important documents on it, etc. You may not be able to keep this bag in your house so consider other places to keep it such as at work, at a friend's house, in a bus station locker, etc.Have an escape plan. In scenario-based planning, people consider all of the \"what ifs\" and make a plan for each possibility. What if things blow up and you need to get your kids from school but don't have a car? Idea: a friend can be added to the list of people who can pick up your kids and they can go get them. What if your abuser is flipping out and trying to kill you? Idea: teach your kids how to call 911. What if you only have a short period of time to escape? Idea: have a plan to exit the house, get to a safe location, get your emergency bag, and get assistance from a local DV agency. The bottom line is to think of every possibility and think of ideas to work around these possibilities so that you can escape and get help.Document, document, document. Often people who are in abusive relationships don't want to call the police, don't want to press charges, and don't want to go to the hospital if they are injured because they don't want the abuser to get arrested. While I always say call the police! press charges! I know that this doesn't often happen. What needs to be done however, whether you are ready to press charges or not, is to document the abuse as much as possible. Going to the hospital is one way to do this, taking photographs is another, keeping a diary at work of each incident, even having a co-worker keep this information for you, is a way to collect enough evidence that in the event that you eventually want to get a restraining order or press charges it will make it much clearer to the judge that there is cause to issue these orders.Once you escape, you will need to cover your tracks (often abusers have access to your cell phone and bank records so can track you this way). Buy a cheap, prepaid phone and turn off/take out the battery from your regular cell phone so it can't be tracked. Withdraw cash from your emergency bank account and pay cash for everything. You may need to apply for a new job so your abuser can't find you and enroll your children in another school depending on how likely it is that the abuser will hunt you down at these places. As a side note, don't use your home computer to plan your escape, look up resources, or otherwise find information that could be useful to your abuser--your internet history will provide this information to your abuser and you never know if key logger or other software to track you has been installed. Ditto, if the possibility that your car may have a GPS tracker on it (usually the police will be able to check your car for this if requested).Set up your defenses. Once you escape, keeping yourself and your kids safe becomes imperative. Staying at a DV shelter at first is a good, safe place since they are very security conscious and used to these types of situations. Take a self defense course (it will give you some confidence but shouldn't be depended on to save your life). Carry a weapon with you that you are trained to use (again, you don't want to confront your abuser and this is a last, LAST resort, but even something like pepper spray can give you a few minutes to escape if they track you down). Let people at work know about your situation and ask if certain safety precautions can be taken for your safety (change the location of your office, put a coded lock on the door so only employees can come in, transfer you to a different location, etc).Recovery. After you escape, you will need to start getting your life back in order. There are a number of legal things that need to be done (protection order, separation or divorce started, temporary child custody/support order) which DV agencies can often help with for free or at little charge. You will also want to see, if you are short on cash, what other sources of aid are available to you in your community such as temporary housing, food stamps, other welfare programs, etc. Many of these things can be found through the DV agency or by calling 211.And a few resources:Call 211 (for assistance and information about social service/legal/medical resources in your community).National Domestic Violence HotlineAARDVARKAn escape plan template"},

{"title": "My Emergency Fund is Having an Emergency", "date": "Monday, May 23, 2011", "text": "My little $1000 emergency fund which has been sitting in a savings account for more than a year just took a $600 hit. I am not happy. It caused near physical pain when I had to withdraw the money from that account today. Bummer. Right now we are living on a pretty tight budget since I am not working. A month ago, I noticed that our cell phone bill with TMobile was averaging $100 a month for not a lot of service (two lines sharing 1000 minutes a month, plus we had to pay extra for text messaging and internet). Then I noticed that TMobile now has a $30 per month pre-paid plan which includes 1500 talk and text minutes plus internet. For two phones that is only $60 per month, a much better deal than we had. I did a quick calculation and found that by discontinuing our contract cell plan we would save $40 per month. Due to the hefty $200 per line cancellation fee, it was a big $400 payment at once but the contract still had many months left and after ten months of using the prepaid plan we would then be ahead. So I went ahead and cancelled the contract and switched to the pre-paid plan. I got the final bill today with the two cancellation fees and the last month's phone bill plus tax which ended up to be about $540. I am happy with our pre-paid plan but paying that big bill all at once made me run to my emergency fund because the income I make (about $200 a month from AdSense and website updates I do for a couple of clients) only covers my monthly bills (cells at $100, tithe at $50, and $50 spending money). Hubby also had to reach into his emergency fund today to send his daughter $500 so both of our little emergency funds are now even smaller. We didn't want to take the money out of our travel/resettlement fund since we will be having some big airfare bills coming up in a few months as well as the possibility of first/last/deposit for an apartment at the end of the year. Hubby's monthly income (about $2000) is used for our monthly spending (food, gas occasionally, entertainment, lunch out occasionally, sundries, etc) and the rest is put aside for our annual and semi-annual bills (storage unit, car insurance, grandson's education, etc).As it stands now...I am a bit freaked out that $500, an amount I would pay for a purse or pair of shoes in my previous life, is such a big deal.We need to put $600 back in my emergency fund ASAP.We need to put $500 back into hubby's emergency fund ASAP.I need to see how creative I can be. At this point we have nothing to sell on CraigsList or EBay for some quick cash and working at a regular job is a bit out of the question since we will be leaving in about a month. So now I am pondering my options to make some quick cash (which should make an interesting blog post). I'll let you know what happens."},

Here's what's going on:Plans. We finally bought our tickets to our next destination which will be Las Vegas. Hubby and the BIL will be taking part in the World Series of Poker tournament there (fingers crossed that they win the multi-million dollar prize!) and I will get to catch up with some friends I haven't seen for a few years. We will be there the last week of June and the first week of July and after that? Well, we haven't decided yet.Health. As soon as we decided to go to Vegas, I decided I better get serious about my health. While my days of having a \"boomin\" bod and hanging out at the pool all day and nightclub all night are long gone, I still don't want to look like a beached whale (which is exactly what I feel like after basically lounging around and doing not much of anything for three months)! My goal is to lose 25 pounds in 40 days and in order to do so I have been working out at least two hours each day as well as eating better than I ever have. I went with a \"Paleo-ish\" diet of only natural, nutritious foods including meat, fish, lots of fruit and vegetables as well as non-paleo foods such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, bananas, and very occasionally rice. In fact, a few days after I started eating this way I was reading Carla's blog over at My 1/2 Dozen Daily and found that what I eat basically follows along with this post (although she rendered the explanation much better--and prettier!--than I could). Basically you skip the grains, dairy, and processed foods and eat only natural food. After just a week, I actually do feel much better, although I very much miss my favorite food groups--wheat, dairy, and Starbucks.Mini Disaster #1. About a week or so ago, I was ready to throw in the towel, move back home, buy another house, and get back into the rat race. I was bored silly (I have always worked at least one, usually two, jobs since I was sixteen but for the past four months I haven't worked at all and was going stir crazy). I missed my friends (I talk to them often and they always ask when I am coming home and I felt like I was missing out on so much with them...I was homesick!). And, since I read the online version of our local paper each day, there have been no less than six front page articles that, had I still been \"in the mix\" so to speak, I would have known about before the things hit the paper. I would have been a part of what was going on instead of reading about things from afar. I felt like my life, or at least my previous life, was passing me by. Then I had a moment of feeling sorry for the idle rich. It is all of these things--working, having a social group, being part of things in a community--that creates the fabric of life. Just traveling around and having no ties takes this important part of living away from you. I was ready to hop on the next plane and go home but hubby told me to stick it out, at least until after Las Vegas, and see where we feel like going from there. So I am waiting and in the past week I haven't felt so bad.Mini Disaster #2. A couple of days ago my step daughter (who is wonderful and the only \"daughter\" I have), sent me a text message. It said \"I'm leaving my husband, can you help me?\" I was ready to do the happy dance as I thoroughly dislike her husband and find him to be borderline abusive and getting worse but we have kept out of their relationship and told her we support whatever she wants to do. After four kids and trying to work it out, seems like she finally wised up and is kicking the idiot to the curb. But I digress. Like most women with four kids, a lousy husband, and a bad relationship, leaving him means that she will basically be out on her own, have to find a new place to live, and have to support her family by herself (we are hoping the guy will pay child support but that remains to be seen). So I know that the help we will provide will be mostly from our emergency fund. Ouch. Fortunately the kids (there's five of them) have learned to not ask us for money (we don't co sign loans, pay their massive cell phone bills, dig them out of credit card debt, or pay bail) but on occasion we do help out with unforeseen emergencies. This is one of them. It remains to be seen how much and what kind of help she will need. And finally, some links. Here's some interesting links you might like: Your Debt Free Checklist (exactly the process we used to get out of debt). Daily Habits that Keep Me Out of Debt (I have most of these same habits). Your Ideal Life Strategy (we basically did these things to get to the point we are at now).Finally, since my blog always looks a little blah due to the lack of pictures, I decided to throw up a picture of my favorite flower to photograph, a dahlia. Have a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Splurge!", "date": "Sunday, May 15, 2011", "text": "For the first time in months, I actually splurged on something I wanted. My weakness is notebooks. Getting a new notebook with crisp, clean pages is so exciting I can barely contain myself! A new notebook means inspiration and new beginnings and...well I guess unless you feel the same, listening to someone wax poetic about paper is probably a bit odd. For others with this same affliction, there is even a website for us...check it out here.So I was at the mall and I needed some inspiration. I have exactly 40 days to get in shape before we go to Las Vegas. After our first month in Atlanta during which I exercised every day, I have really slacked off. Add to that the mountains of yummy food hubby cooks daily and more snacks in the pantry than you would find in a convenience store and, well, let's just say that even my \"fat clothes\" are getting tight. I was at my favorite store (Barnes and Noble) and I was lost in their huge notebook section and I figured that if I got a new notebook I could track my efforts to get in shape and lose weight during the next 40 days. There were plenty to choose from ranging from expensive (about $10 each) to super expensive (around $20 each). I saw the notebook pictured above and just had to have it. It is a Moleskein notebook designed specifically to log your health and fitness and food and goals and...basically everything I wanted to do. I was sold. I did have a coupon for B&N which came in my email box but it was only for 13% off. Eighteen dollars and ninety five cents later I left the store with my new notebook in hand, properly motivated (I hope) to make some significant changes to my health in the next six weeks.Of course I could justify my splurge...I figure that if I don't have anything from Starbucks (another unfortunate weekly habit) for the next 40 days I will have more than saved the cost of the notebook...too bad I can't justify the $189 Marc Jacobs bag I saw at Nordstroms!"},

{"title": "How to Get the Best Prices on the Things You Need", "date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2011", "text": "Being die-hard frugal people, the hubby and I always try to get the best price on everything we buy. Being fairly wealthy, the SIL doesn't really care about price tags. Every time the SIL goes shopping, hubby tells her \"you can get that cheaper at...\" She just rolls her eyes. Now these people are in their 60s so it's kind of cute to see them acting like older teenage brother/younger sister instead of the seniors they are.Anyway, hubby's latest comment was on soda. The SIL went to Costco and bought a case of soda in the can for around $6.99. We were at the local Kroger store and found the same soda in the two litre bottle for 85 cents each. When we got home, the hubby pointed out the great price to his sister. She rolled her eyes...again.We have a few methods for getting the lowest prices on the things we buy...For material goods (clothes, TVs, etc), we look at our cheapest options in the community (Dollar Store, Discount Store, Walmart, on sale at a big box store, etc) then go online to compare prices. I'm not much for buying used things but plenty of people I know shun all of these options in favor of finding the items they want at garage sales and on CraigsList (which is a super cheap way to get stuff as prices are usually 10 cents on the dollar this way). Another way to stretch your money while buying material goods is to look for substitutions. I may be looking for a 50\" name brand television but can I live with a 50\" TV of another brand that costs $400 less or a slightly smaller TV which will also save hundreds of dollars? In most cases, the answer is yes. What we also ask is can we do without? Obviously this saves the most money and reduces the clutter/stuff we will eventually get rid of considerably. Finally, an option which is kind of between buying and doing without is borrowing or renting an item. This has become more popular as people realize that they don't need to buy a fancy lawnmower/edger/weedwhacker/etc when the items will just sit idle in the garage 95% of the time. A better option is for each neighbor to buy an item and share it with everyone else in the neighborhood saving both money and the time/upkeep/storage space to keep it.For food, our options are similar. The first thing we do is look at store advertising circulars and find the lowest prices offered for the things we want (generally we build our menus around what is on sale instead of building menus then trying to find low prices on the items needed). Next we look at all of our shopping options: grocery store, Walmart with food center, military commissaries, Dollar Stores, discount grocery stores, even the local quick stop market sometimes have great prices on staples (like a gallon of milk for $2 or 10 pounds of potatoes for $1). Again, like with material goods, we also look for substitutions (sometimes when we get to the store and look for a sale item that is on our list, we may find the same item in another brand cheaper than the name brand sale item), and we look for substitute items as well (ie: if mozzarella cheese has a cheaper price than the swiss cheese we planned on buying, we determine if this different product will work for what we are making and usually go with the cheaper option). Occasionally we go to our last option which is doing without. I haven't had salmon since we have been in Atlanta simply because the price here ($9 a pound) is astronomical compared to the price we pay for salmon in Seattle (about $5 a pound). Finally, sharing is possible with food too. At home we often have \"potluck\" type meals with friends and relatives and if someone finds an awesome price on an item, such as a case of bananas for very little money, we tend to share these as well.I am a little freaked out by how quickly and astronomically prices are rising on many of the items we use everyday however with the methods above, we are still able to get the things we want and need at a reasonable price."},
{"title": "Happy Mother's Day!", "date": "Sunday, May 8, 2011", "text": "Happy Mother's Day to all of you awesome mothers, grandmothers, aunts, God mothers, step moms, foster moms, and all of you other ladies out there who take an active role in helping to shape the future of our kids. Moms have a super tough job to do (you don't realize this until your own kids are making you crazy and then it hits you...yes this is what my mom had to go through with me. eekkk) so setting aside just one day to spoil mom doesn't seem like enough but, at least for today, here's hoping you indulge your mom like crazy today.Financial lesson: this is one area where I don't mind splurging. My mom died young so I never got to fully appreciate everything she did for her kids and I didn't get to spoil her on her special day like I wish I could do now."},
{"title": "Stay Home, Save Money. Here's How", "date": "Wednesday, May 4, 2011", "text": "One of our biggest challenges when we were first getting serious about saving money and paying off debt was what to do with ourselves. At that time, our habits were pretty bad and almost everything we did included spending money. Instead of staying home, where we couldn't spend money, it was our habit, if we were bored, to go out. Go out to eat. Go out to the mall. Go out and wander around Costco. Go further afield and run to Vancouver, BC or Portland, OR for the weekend. It seemed like every time we left our house, it included parting with our hard earned cash whether for gas to get us around, food because we weren't home to eat, or to buy more and more material items at the mall because they looked new and much nicer than the stuff we had at home. What we really had was a problem with keeping ourselves occupied when we were bored.Now that we have been at my sister-in-law's house for a couple of months where there is pretty much nothing to do that doesn't involve spending money if we leave the house (and since we are trying to save every penny for our trip to Asia this fall) we have become experts at keeping ourselves entertained for free. Here's some ways to keep yourself and the family entertained at home instead of spending money to beat boredom:Cook. We have been cooking up a storm, using whatever we can find in the pantry. Actually hubby usually cooks and I usually bake. This tends to take up a lot of time and it is fun too.Read. There is a library down the street so occasionally I will go there and read books but mostly I have found quite a few books to read online for free. All you have to do is Google for free books to read online and/or download the free Kindle e-reader at Amazon then check out the huge list of e-books offered for free at Amazon.Study. I have been brushing up on both Spanish and Japanese during the past couple of months. This involved an initial outlay of cash for the books that I am using (the Practice Makes Perfect series is awesome!) but now I use the books to study every day for free. If there are other subjects you have been wanting to brush up on, MIT offers an excellent (free!) list of online courses here.Communicate. I still keep in touch with many of my friends back home and around the world. Thanks to the internet, I can do this for free! I use FaceBook, email, Chikka, and instant messages to communicate with my friends.Exercise. Some of the best exercise in the world can be had just by walking out your door and around your neighborhood. All you need is a pair of shoes and you can walk as far (or near) as you like, as fast (or slow) as you like. You can also do calisthenics at home, follow along with free exercise programs online or on TV, and life weights (even if you only have canned food to use as \"weights\") all at no charge.Enjoy a hobby. I am sorely challenged when it comes to being crafty but I admire my friends who can sew, quilt, knit, crochet, or do any of the other craft hobbies that can take up hours of time and effort with just a small initial outlay of cash for supplies. Other hobbies I occasionally enjoy include fishing, taking photos with my digital camera, doing origami, and playing chess with the hubby.Volunteer. Unfortunately there is no where nearby for me to volunteer right now, but at home I often volunteer ten to twenty hours per week with various organizations. Fortunately, the internet allows me to still provide some services for organizations that I love so I have been able to update websites for a couple of non profits that I work with and write grants for a few others. I know another lady who is mostly home-bound but was recently recognized as a volunteer of the year for all of the hours she gives to various homeless organizations just via her computer and telephone from home.Watch TV shows, videos, and movies either online or on cable. We haven't been watching much cable TV lately but we have both been enjoying a wide range of shows online in the evenings. Hubby enjoys his free online TV shows broadcast from the Philippines and I have been watching a Korean soap opera every evening (also free, also online).Playing with the kids. We like to play with the kids after dinner each evening, mostly to keep them out of grandma's hair but also because they are so darn fun to watch. I've never seen kids more enamoured with simple things (boxes, plastic bowls, the neighbor's cat, chasing the ducks) in my life. We toss the ball back and forth, make \"forts\" out of blankets when it is too cold to go outside, color, etc. All of this is free and it is great for the kids (and us too!).It really is a major lifestyle change when you go from paying for your entertainment each day to entertaining yourself for free but it is also a wonderful way to explore new things and save a boatload of money in the process!"},
{"title": "Link Round-up and More", "date": "Tuesday, May 3, 2011", "text": "One of these days I will write a real blog post. Until then, here's some interesting links...80 Ways to Be Frugal and Save MoneyStolen Camera Finder (this looks interesting although I haven't had a camera stolen so can't vouch for it's usefulness)20 Things Life is Too Short to Tolerate (can I get an amen!)reddit Frugal (this is my favorite webpage to visit when I am pondering yet more ways to be frugal and save money)And more...After I wrote my last post on our \"up in the air\" life plans, I received a nice message from a blogger I have never met (yet I often read her blog) inviting my husband and I to stay at her place for a couple of weeks this summer. I was pretty blown away because, wow, we are strangers, but the blogging community is soooo amazing and people are soooo nice. How cool is that?Also after I wrote my last post, my sister in law, who has been living with her boyfriend for a couple of years, said \"I think I want to get married...let's go\". Her boyfriend has been wanting to get married but when she called him up at work and told him he was getting married ASAP, he was surprised as us. So now we are all working on wedding plans for a wedding that will take place some time within the next month or so, somewhere in the US. As I have stated before, our plans tend to change daily!I have often heard of \"Tiger Moms\", especially after this article from Amy Chua came out. I never thought I would actually be living with one. After spending a lot of time over the past couple of weeks with my SIL and her grandkids, I realized she IS a Tiger Mom, Yikes. It seems to work, as both of her kids are quite successful, but now it appears she is working on her grandkids. Her methods are both appalling and interesting at the same time. HmmmFor the past few months we have been almost blissfully unaware of rising gas and food prices. The SIL provides us with a car and insists that we use her gas card to fill up the tank when needed as we mostly use it to run errands and cart the nieces from activity to activity. Likewise we do some shopping (eeking out super cheap deals on meat and produce at a wonderful local Asian store) yet she makes huge shopping hauls from Costco which provides a lot of food for us and everyone else (ie: here's 15 pounds of prime rib...do something with it!). Our \"re-entry\" into living on our own in a few months should be quite shocking."},
{"title": "An Update...Or, What We Are Doing Now", "date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2011", "text": "Here's what we are doing now...We met Dan Morehead this weekend. He is a friend of a friend and he is a professional fisherman. I was pretty incredulous when my friend told me this. \"You mean he gets PAID to fish??\" Yep, in fact he does. I'm sure there are plenty of people who would love to quit their job and get paid to fish. This is one man (among many, apparently) who have done just that. I love it when I see people living their dreams. Amazing!I saw this article in the paper yesterday (actually the online version of the paper because it's free) and thought back to when we were in that position. As we learned and they learned, in order to get out of debt you have to: radically change your lifestyle and spending habits, pay cash for everything, and realize that if you can't afford to pay cash for something, you can't buy it. Simple, boring tips but they absolutely work!I have been working on my new goal list for this year. To date, I have been able to achieve a few of the goals absolutely free. One of my goals was to go to the Medieval Times restaurant which we have never been to. At this point, I really didn't want to spend $50 per person on dinner, but it just so happens that they were having a two for one special and when I told the hubby that I wanted to go there for my birthday, my SIL overheard me and said she would pay for it. A fun, interesting goal completed for free! Another goal was to watch ten TED talks which I did for free online (they have some truly amazing speakers!) here. I also want to read a classic novel each month so I downloaded the free Kindle e-reader to my computer then downloaded Jane Eyre (also free since many classics are offered at no charge) which I just finished--the book is WAY better than the movie! Finally, I have been watching a Korean soap opera that I only caught a few episodes of a some years back. I thought I would have to rent the entire 35-episode set but fortunately (after looking at many websites that either didn't play the videos or weren't complete) I was able to find it here where I can watch the whole series for free (complete with great video quality and very good translation).I know a couple of soon to be high school graduates who are still scrambling for college money so I sent them this interesting list of scholarships to apply for.Finally, we are debating what to do/where to go next. We are still in Atlanta for another six weeks or so. Our plan was to go to Connecticut next to visit family for a month or two then head back to Seattle before we go to Asia this fall. Unfortunately we are getting a bit tired of being professional \"couch surfers\" and I really miss having my own place (although getting free rent for four months really can't be beat!). It kind of takes all of the fun out of going on vacation when you are permanently on vacation... So we are trying to weight the pluses and minuses of our decision. If we go to CT we will again get free rent for a month or two which saves a lot of money, on the other hand, we will have to drive to all of the places we want to go there as there is no public transportation where our family lives and the cost of gas in the area is more than $4 a gallon! Plus, since the hubby is the oldest of the clan, it often falls on him to pay for a lot of activities that the family does (I know we can opt out but culturally that is just the way things are) so these would be added expenses. If we go back to Seattle we can get a small apartment until we decided if/when/where to buy another house. The good thing is that this way we will have our own place and get to use a very good public transportation system as well as have more control over our expenses (with the big clan in CT there is always places people want to go so we often find ourselves going to the casinos, nightclubs, shopping, restaurants, heading over to Boston or New York for shopping etc. Hubby is thinking of all of these expenses and cringing).So that's where we stand now. Plans seem to change on a daily basis around here so who knows where we will end up!"},
{"title": "How Other People Spend and Save Money", "date": "Thursday, April 21, 2011", "text": "Here's some wonderful links that show how other people spend (and save!) their hard-earned money:Over at Get Rich Slowly, JD Roth outlines how he spends and saves money in this post. When I read the post, I was thinking I could have written it! Everything from conscious spending to reducing our exposure to advertising to walking more to save gas and improve health are things that we currently do to save money.Trent over at The Simple Dollar posted this question from a reader along with his answer and, again, it just goes to show that people who are really focused on getting out of debt pretty much come to the same conclusions. In fact, the day before I read this post, I was thinking the exact same thing that he wrote in the first line of his answer \"the biggest switch in getting away from materialism was to start focusing on what I had instead of what I didn't have.\" It just so happened that my birthday was a few days ago. Hubby asked me what I wanted for my birthday, I gave it some thought, and I honestly couldn't think of a single thing I wanted. I have a wonderful place to stay, plenty of delicious food, every need taken care of, enough money for my meager bills, and most important, I have the hubby with me. Thinking of everything I do have (along with staying out of the malls, not being around friends/co-workers who make materialism a daily contest, and, most importantly, not having any place to store any new things that I buy) makes me very content.My favorite traveling family, The Family on Bikes, recently posted this insightful article How to Afford Long Term Family Travel, on their blog. Like we have found out, when you do something so far from the norm of: work, buy a house, buy a car, work some more, collect even more material goods, pay your credit cards, and go back and work some more, the first question people have is \"how can you afford it???\". We get that question all the time. For us, we are two adults with very few needs, but when you are talking about a family of four complete with two growing teenagers, it becomes an even more incredible feat to afford such a grand adventure. This post outlines one creative way a family can make such a thing happen.Then I came across this article on How to Prepare if You Think You Might Lose Your Job. This is yet another article that really hit home with me. Late last fall, I could see the writing on the wall. With very little warning, my main client more or less went belly up. We basically did half of what we recommended in this article, namely, we assessed our situation, looked at our monthly outflow of cash, started cutting back on every single expense, and instead of positioning myself for another job, came to the conclusion that we could hop off this hamster wheel and hop right back on another one or we could make a drastic change. We chose the drastic change option.Finally, I thought this was a useful post to share: 100 Best Money Moves from CNN. Many of the things they suggest are good ideas. There are a few, however, that were downright dumb. You don't NEED a smartphone or an iPad, plus you know my stance on credit cards so it just makes sense to use the money moves that work best for your situation.Happy reading!"},
{"title": "Save $1000 This Month", "date": "Tuesday, April 19, 2011", "text": "It wasn't until we got super serious about paying off our debt and then, preparing to sell everything and travel, that my attitude about spending money did a 180. Before, I kept spending and spending and wondered why my goal of getting out of debt never happened. Soon I found Dave Ramsey and began watching his show religiously. Only then did I decided to change my attitude and start cutting cost relentlessly because, as Dave says, \"if you want to live like no one else, first you have to live like no one else.\" Did you know that statement is completely true? For most of our lives we were living like everyone else which meant we were spending like maniacs and we were broke. After a couple of years of living like no one else (mostly because no one would actually want to live like we were living, we were so miserly) we are now living like no one else that we know (and now they are asking how we can live like we do...I have to remind them about all of the times we were doing the things listed below...).So if you want to get seriously radical, here's how you can literally save $1000 this month (big change of attitude and ability to ignore those who think you are crazy is required):Save $100 and cut out cable TV completely. About 97% of the stuff on cable is junk anyway. Even though the SIL has cable at her house, we still only watch what would be available on regular TV with a set-top digital converter box (free after initial purchase of the box). We have also started watching many more of the TV shows and movies we like online.Get your grocery money for the month, take $100 of the money and put it in the bank, then spend the rest on food. Depending on your grocery budget, you may literally be eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for a month or you may only have to cut out restaurant meals. Will it be difficult? Yes. Will you be able to get super creative and make it work anyway? Yes. For tips on saving money on food, check here.Sell, sell, sell. The average American can sell some of the stuff they own, take in $200, and still not miss what they got rid of. Consider a garage sale, selling unwanted gold and jewelry, selling stuff on CraigsList, and/or selling stuff on eBay.Look at all of your insurance coverages (life, health, auto, home) and see where you can make cuts in order to save $100. We were able to save more than $100 every six months by dropping the full coverage insurance on our car. The value of our 2001 van had dropped below $3000 and we have more than $3000 in our emergency fund so if we did have to buy another car because of a wreck, we would be able to \"self insure\" so to speak (and save money each month we don't have to pay for full coverage insurance which would have given us no more than the current value of the car anyway in the event of a wreck). Obviously you never want to drop auto liability insurance, which would be illegal, or drop medical coverage that you need. Save $100 on your utilities this month by becoming a radical power/water/sewer/gas/garbage saver. Every once in a while we would experiment to see just how much we could save on our utilities and we would go all out to do this. We were able to cut our garbage pick up to every other week for the last few years we were in our house to save money (lots less shopping will give you lots less garbage BTW), we would set the heat lower/air conditioning higher (depending on the time of year), and become super careful about saving every penny possible on electricity, gas, and water. All of these little efforts can really save you a lot of money when added together!Save $100 on the gas for your car this month. This may take a lot of creativity and compromise, especially seeing as how every time I look at gas prices they have jumped up even higher, but it can be done. Can you take public transportation for a couple of weeks? If it costs you $100 to fill up your tank each week, and only $20 for public transportation, you can save $100 in less than two weeks! You may also consider riding your bike to work, car pooling with friends, asking to work from home, etc.Don't shop at ALL this month and save $200. For us, each time we go to the store, we spend a minimum of $50. If we don't shop AT ALL for the month, we can save around $200. Yes, this is super boring and feels like total deprivation but it is possible to do this if it is only for a month. You have clothes and shoes so you can squeak by for a month without buying any more of these things. You still have your food budget so you can shop for necessary food, but all other shopping (clothes, toys, books, shampoo, makeup, etc) is out for a month. Save $100 on services that you usually pay for: mow your yard all month instead of paying for it to be done, clean your own house instead of paying for it to be done, save $100 on daycare by having a friend/grandma babysit for free (it takes courage to ask when otherwise you would never do such a thing but you can always trade services--you babysit for a friend, they babysit for you--if you don't want to flat out ask for a freebie).It takes quite a bit of effort and \"chutzpah\" to save so much money in such a short amount of time, but just tell yourself that it is only for one month and you will survive it. You may end up, like me, finding that many of the \"radical\" changes you make to save money for just this one month actually stick and become a part of things you do on a regular basis!"},

{"title": "The Yearly Goal Wrap Up", "date": "Friday, April 15, 2011", "text": "I'm going to be 44 in a couple of days which reminded me that I needed to wrap up my annual goal list which I posted here about 365 days ago. The list is pretty self explanatory; unfortunately I completed less than half of the items, but on the other hand, there were so many changes during the past year, that I am still really satisfied with what has happened during my 43rd year of life. At the time I wrote the list, I had no inkling that our lives would change so dramatically. I wanted to travel more but we didn't know at the time that the universe would converge and a bundle of serendipitous events would result in us now traveling full time. What started as a dream--being able to sell everything and have the funds to travel for at least a year--became a reality when my main client went belly up in late fall (without basically being forced out of a job, I probably would have never had the guts to leave a \"good job\". That would be crazy right?), and I was faced with the decision of finding more work for my business or (horrors) finding an actual job to pay our bills and support our lifestyle. Also, home values were declining and our house was way too big for us and we wanted to get out while we still had equity in the house so we put it up for sale and it sold rather quickly. Then, seeing as how my work days were numbered, we got laser intense on getting out of debt (selling gold, selling nearly everything we owned, CraigsListing like a maniac, no shopping at all, etc). By the time our house was getting ready to close, we determined that since we were nearly debt free, had enough income coming in to meet what would be a minuscule amount of living expenses without the house, and didn't actually need a new home right away since we would be traveling, we decided to put the small amount of things we kept in storage and have been traveling since February. Miracles really do happen! Since I am still really into lists, I have created a new goal list for my 44th year of life. I posted it here on my other blog and have hopes that I will get a lot more completed this year. Many items were taken from last year's list because they are things I still really want to do, while other items are travel-related. Overall, I am looking forward to an amazing, adventurous, year!"},
{"title": "10 Things About Little Kids (Money Saving Tips Included!)", "date": "Thursday, April 14, 2011", "text": "We are a month into our adventure in babysitting for the hubby's sister's grandkids. They are two and four year old little girls who are generally pretty good--as good as two and four year olds can be--but it has been quite the re-learning experience. Here's what I have learned so far: It doesn't take much to entertain them and certainly doesn't require a room full of toys to do so. We have made tents out of blankets, played cook with real pots and pans, been to the local park numerous times, read numerous books (from the library), and the older one has helped me make cookies (she likes to stir stuff) and clean (I put dry rags on her feet and she \"skates\" behind me to dry the floor as I mop).Grandma has a strict no TV policy. They never watch TV but do watch little kid videos from the library. Occasionally I'll let them watch 'Arthur' which is a really good cartoon on PBS (no violence, lots of information on good values, etc). That's probably why I haven't heard them ask for a single kiddie consumer item yet--because they don't get to see the commercials for these things so aren't brainwashed into begging for them.They aren't picky eaters. Both mom and grandma tell them that if they don't eat what's on the table, they can go hungry. As a result, they are really good eaters. This saves money, time, and aggravation (another kid I know will eat exactly three items total--chicken nuggets, Gogurt, and cheese pizza--if these things aren't in the house, the mom will literally run out to the store to get it). This makes for an annoying, picky kid who gets to control the parents. Not good.I have to control myself at the Dollar Store. It would be so easy to fill my basket with things they would like--there's so much cute stuff and it's ONLY A DOLLAR! However, I would eventually be broke and end up with a house full of junk. So I try to restrain myself and buy them each one small thing every other week.I have to control them at the Dollar Store. Note to self, leave kids home when going shopping. Eventually they will need to learn how to shop but taking kids by rack after rack of toys is enough to make anyone (me and them) crazy. With four adults in the house, there is usually someone around to watch them when someone else goes shopping.Some things are worth their weight in gold. The little one is usually pretty good (except for the fearlessness part where she will fling herself off of anything--slide, sofa, pool--whether or not someone is there to catch her) but the other day she was a total maniac, like call-the-exorcist kind of maniac. I went through the usual list--not hungry, not thirsty, not tired, and then figured out she had a couple of new teeth coming in. While I usually look for cheaper alternatives to whatever I need to buy, I had no qualms about buying teething gel at the local grocery store. It was something that couldn't wait and made both of us happy.A potty trained kid is a good thing. The little one has been potty trained since she was about a year and a half old. This is kind of a luck of the draw thing as some kids potty train very young and others make you wonder if they will ever get out of diapers, but the sooner the better (it saves the cost of diapers and the ick factor of changing them).Enrichment activities are also a good thing. I usually hesitate to buy toys, figuring they will be discarded and forgotten pretty quickly, however I don't have any qualms about paying for enrichment activities for kids. The older girl takes gymnastic and karate when she is home with her parents and has been enrolled in a local karate school since she came here. Lessons give kids things they can't just discard, namely, skills, the ability to set and reach goals, the opportunity to work with others, and many other things that they will carry with them into adulthood.If you give something to one, you need an identical item to give to the other. I know they need to learn how to share but at this age, they want exactly what the other has. If one gets something the other doesn't get, lots of crying and hitting ensues. Eek.Everyone gets to be on a schedule. For the hubby and I, who have basically thrown our schedules to the wind, this took a bit of adjustment, but it works much better when there is a clear schedule each day and everyone knows what comes next. They get their naps on time which means they don't get cranky, everyone knows when to come home for dinner which makes for a fun way to share a meal and encourages good eating habits, and we know exactly when to take them to the park for optimal burning of energy (and optimal response to nap time!).Over all it's been a wonderful experience. All of our grandkids live far away from us so it is nice to have little ones around for a change. It is also our first foray into doing something so totally out of the ordinary for us--namely trading work for room and board which makes it even more adventurous."},
{"title": "The Joy of Paying Bills", "date": "Tuesday, April 12, 2011", "text": "I never thought I would be happy to pay bills but these days I am pretty happy because, #1, there is so few of them, and #2, they aren't expensive bills. Thinking back to when our bills totalled somewhere around $8000-$10,000 per month, I am positively giddy when I look at our short bill list! Here's what we pay now: Annually: private mail box (around $150), grandson's school ($480), car registration ($40) Semi annually: car insurance ($200 every six months) Monthly: cell phone ($85 per month), tithe ($50), have mail sent from PMB ($10), storage unit ($55 per month), health insurance ($35 per month) Notes: A private mail box is way more expensive than a postal box but well worth the money when you travel because they will hold your mail for an unlimited amount of time and also send you all of your collected mail to where ever you happen to be (for a small fee; we usually have mail sent once a month for about $10).We have committed to sending our grandson to school in the Philippines so this expense will be around for another decade or so. Currently he attends a public school but we told him that if he does well we will send him to a private school for high school and college so this cost will most likely increase. Since they don't have such things as Social Security or welfare in the Philippines, we feel his education will be the only thing that will help support his family in the future so it is well worth the cost.Even though our car has been parked since early February, we still pay liability-only car insurance so we will be insured when we drive other people's cars. We also get to pay the annual registration to keep it street legal so the guy who is watching it can drive it around occassionally to keep it running.Our cell contract will expire in December at which time we will go to no-contract cell phones since we don't use them much any more.I used to tithe 10% of my income but since I am not working and don't have much income, I still feel it is necessary to tithe monthly so I have settled on $50 a month until I earn more.Our storage unit is holding about $15,000 worth of stuff so the small monthly fee we pay for this service is well worth it. When we decide where/when to resettle this fee will go away.We have an amazing health insurance plan for such a little bit of money; hubby has this automatically deducted from his retirement pay each month.I really like paying bills on an annual basis so you can pay once then forget about it until the next year however some bills won't allow this (cell phone, car insurance). Since we are unsure of how long we will store our stuff, we have opted to pay for the storage unit monthly although we will pay some months in advance if we are out of the country.Online bill paying and online banking are awesome! This makes it so very easy to keep track of your money and move it around to pay bills. Unfortunately my bank doesn't have a way to scan checks in order to deposit them so when we get checks in the mail (a nice after affect from the sale of our house--we still have small checks coming in for various things) I have to mail them to our branch in Washington, however it only takes a few days for them to post.Money that comes in monthly (hubby's pension and Social Security, my small earnings from online stuff) is put in savings or used to pay for our daily needs (food mostly, make up and toiletries, and other small random things we need). Fortunately we don't have room to cart stuff with us around the country so we don't shop for many material items.So far we have been able to trade services for room and board and the use of a car so that in itself has cut what would be regular monthly expenses to nearly nil for the time being.I came across this blog post from Married With Luggage which outlines how much another set of travelers spend each month. Interesting!We have talked about the possibility of buying another house and settling down again but neither one of us feels compelled to do so yet. We plan to keep traveling for another year or so, but, as we have learned with this lifestyle, you never know what will happen. Our plans have already changed significantly about six times in the last two months so we really don't know where we will end up next or what new adventures await us. As Betsy said in the blog post above, when you get into the traveling (free!) lifestyle, you don't have many constraints and can be open to many more possibilities. We may look for house sitting opportunities, we may look into volunteer opportunities that provide room and board, we might camp for a month (a distinct possibility when I bike from Canada to Mexico later this summer)...you just never know. What I do know at this point is that I never want to be saddled with many thousands of dollars of monthly bills ever again!"},
{"title": "Allergy Season...Ugh", "date": "Friday, April 8, 2011", "text": "I thought it was odd that my cold was hanging on for so long. The stuffy nose, sneezing, can't go anywhere without a Kleenex thing was getting old. Then I walked into Walmart yesterday and the first thing we came to was a wall of allergy medicine. Ohhhhh So I hopped online and went to weatherbug.com and saw that the pollen forecast was a 10.2 out of 12 (in other words, high) and then it dawned on me that maybe my cold was mingling in with allergies. Ick. Fortunately I don't have allergies year round but early spring seems to be a killer and early spring in Atlanta where everything is starting to bloom is really playing havoc with my sinuses. Here's what I do to try to lessen the impact: I try to lay off the milk, dairy products, and wheat. These items seem to make my allergies even worst.I use a \"nettie pot\" type device (actually one of those bulb \"snot removers\" that got left by one of the grandkids) to clean out my nose once or twice a day.If it gets really bad, I close all of the windows and turn on the AC if it gets too hot. I really love fresh air but early in the spring, when the windows are open all day, you can literally see a layer of pollen on the hard surfaces near the windows.I dust and mop and vacuum more often.I try to walk early in the evening while it is still late but after the pollen has died down.It is already a decades old habit (I learned this in Japan) but we never wear shoes in the house and we usually change into \"house clothes\" when we get home to avoid tracking in the dust and pollen we pick up outside."},
{"title": "What I'm Doing Now", "date": "Wednesday, April 6, 2011", "text": "Here's a quick update... I'm currently recuperating from being sick. It wasn't as severe as the flu but I did feel pretty crappy for the past few days. I am sure I picked it up from the nieces we are taking care of. I love carrying around cute little toddlers. I forgot, however, that whenever I am in the same zip code as a toddler I get sick. Guess my immune system isn't up to par. A cheap, quick cure for this: lots of water/tea/soup, lots of vitamin C, and a bit of Thera Flu.Right this very minute I am watching the new show \"Extreme Couponing\" on TLC. I am super inspired by the people's stories (most note that they are debt free too!)--they are literally getting hundreds of dollars of food and toiletries for a few dollars...AMAZING! I use coupons occasionally but not like they do on this show. On the one hand, it does seem to take a lot of time and preparation to do what these extreme couponers do and since we are living so minimally, we don't have the need/storage space for all of the stuff that they can buy for literally pennies. On the other hand, if I can spend a few dollars and get lots and lots of stuff, maybe I should and just give it away to people who need it. Stay tuned for a post on couponing!I am using my free time to brush up on both my Japanese and Spanish language skills with my new books. I am also using a site called Quizlet to test myself on these languages for free (check this site out for all sorts of free study help with everything from languages and math to history and the MCAT/LSAT/GRE).We have been getting creative in the food department. The hubby and I do all of the cooking for everyone and while my SIL provides a lot of food (her hobby is shopping at Costco) we like to contribute as well. We have found a huge Asian grocery store where prices are pretty good. At most grocery stores I am absolutely stunned by how high prices have gone on many basic food items. So mainly our meals consist of soups, stews, casseroles, lots of stuff baked from scratch, and lots of ethnic meals (Mexican, Indian, Asian) which really helps to stretch our food dollars while at the same time adding lots of variety to our meals. Note: the SIL and her SO have repeatedly said they have never eaten so much at home and they have also repeatedly said they actually like eating at home now.A real time update....a guy on the Extreme Couponing show just bought $5743 worth of groceries and sundries for around $250 and an armload of coupons. Holy Cow! The good part is he is giving away most of the stuff he got to the food bank. Very cool! I predict that tomorrow the grocery stores will see a decided uptick in people using coupons!We may be starting a trend. The SIL and her SO (sister in law and her significant other) have asked us quite a few questions about how we got to the point we are at now (no home, no need to work, very few bills and expenses, and unlimited time to travel and do what we want to do). They would both like to retire soon but said that they need to bring in a minimum of $10,000 a month in retirement income in order to do so. I was flabbergasted. For most people, if your lifestyle is costing you $10,000 a month, you will NEVER be able to retire. So over many dinners we have discussed how we decided that freedom was much more important to us than material goods, how we paid off our debts, how we sold nearly everything we owned, and how we are experimenting with a mobile lifestyle, at least for the time being. We also told them that the two of us can easily live on $2000 per month (currently we are only spending about $1000 per month since we are getting free room and board). Hearing those numbers, they were flabbergasted! Now they are seriously talking about selling their huge house, talking about ways to decrease their debt, and they now think that retirement may actually be possible. It takes four adults to take care of two small children (and we are still tired at the end of the day!). How women in their 40s have babies is beyond me--the energy required to keep up with the (extremely energetic) kids we are taking care of now is beyond what I could ever do by myself. But it is fun, the kids are very nice and sweet, as well mannered as can be expected for a two and four year old, and we feel like we are positively impacting both the SIL (she has built in babysitters any time she needs them) and the kids (they get to have fun with their aunt and uncle plus we like to spoil them a bit).I should get back to regular blogging soon, now that I am not coughing like a maniac. I will now go finish watching the couponing show!"},
{"title": "A Book Shopping Revelation", "date": "Friday, April 1, 2011", "text": "For the past few weeks I have been looking at a couple of books each time I go to Barnes and Noble. Since I really hate to pay retail for anything, I have been waiting to get a coupon which B & N regularly sends to my email inbox so I could at least save a little off the price of the books. Yesterday I finally got a coupon in my email which would have taken 10% off the retail price of the books. That was OK, but since one of the books was $60 (a college-level Japanese language text which I want to use to refresh my language skills before we go to Japan in the fall), that would still only save me $6 which is about the cost of tax. However, I really wanted the book, so I was ready to splurge but alas I was pretty lazy yesterday and didn't feel like driving to the mall so I went online to B&N thinking I would purchase the book there. To my surprise, the book that cost $60 in the store only cost $45 online! Maybe everyone else knows about this pricing thing--go to the store, pay much more? But it was a surprise to me. Then it got me to thinking that maybe I could find the book for even less somewhere else online so I Googled the title and was even more surprised when the book came up for $40 at Amazon. With free shipping! I thought I would push my luck even more and Googled 'Amazon promo codes and coupons' but none of the coupons I found would work for the books I wanted. Oh well...I ended up getting both books for a total of $46 with free shipping and they should be here in a couple of days. Now I'm a happy camper with an extra $30 in my pocket. The moral of this post is that if you are willing to spend your hard-earned money on something, it pays to shop around instead of just going to the logical source, especially now that the internet has put a range of shopping possibilities at our fingertips."},
{"title": "Can I Trade You for That?", "date": "Wednesday, March 30, 2011", "text": "It's been almost three months since my income was reduced by about 90%. Fortunately we are debt free and fortunately we are traveling now and don't have the giant overhead that we used to have when we owned a house and had all of the related expenses. However, when you don't have a lot of cash on hand, you really become aware of just how much everything costs. A couple of years ago I would think nothing of spending hundreds of dollars on random, and completely unnecessary, items. A new computer? Check. A new Coach purse? Check. A giant shopping spree at a Macy's clearance sale? Yep, that happened too. These days, however, pulling money out of my bank account is like pulling teeth...with no novacaine! So I have resorted to that age-old method for getting the things I want, bartering. Here's what I've done in the last couple of months: The hubby and I are getting free room and board and car from the SIL by trading our services as a babysitter and cook (BTW, hubby is the cook, otherwise we would all starve). Hubby cooks all of the meals for everyone (dinner at night and lots of leftovers for lunches) and we both take care of her two grandchildren on the days that she works (which is actually pretty easy because all we need to do is get them ready and drive them to daycare, pick them up from daycare and take them to karate, then bring them home in the evening). So we still have lots of free time but are providing a valuable service for the SIL who would otherwise have a lot more work to do (now that I have been reminded how much work--and patience--are required to take care of two little girls, I feel like I want to give an award to each harried mother I pass each day!). I've also helped her out by writing a couple of policies for her for her job (something I used to do quite often so it was really simple) and teaching her boyfriend how to sell things on CraigsList.When I took the kids to the karate school, I noticed that the school didn't have a website. I offered to design a site for the school's owner in exchange for two months of karate lessons (we will be here until early June and I could definitely use some more exercise!). He agreed.When I went to a local salon to get my hair cut, the lady that was cutting my hair was talking about how she is looking for a job in another industry (she cuts hair on the side and was recently laid off from her finance job). She said that her resume needed to be updated so I told her I would make a trade with her--my next haircut free in exchange for looking at her resume and making some changes to make it look more up to date.I have also traded some work (mostly website design and grant writing) for software, Starbucks cards, and some cash over the past couple of months.Of course I always like earning actual money but bartering is fun! You never know what you will end up with and it is a good way to help people out who may not have cash but certainly have something of value to trade."},
{"title": "Should You Buy a House?", "date": "Saturday, March 26, 2011", "text": "I came across this article about a guy who said he will never, ever, buy a house again.  It seems like a pretty extreme stance to take, kind of like having your heart broken and swearing off ever falling in love again! The situation in the housing market has hit people pretty hard.  For those of us with long enough memories, this sort of thing seems to happen every once in a while like the plunge in the housing market in the 1970's, the blip in the mid 1980's, and this most recent downturn in the market which, perhaps, impacted more people than in previous episodes because more people were lured into buying houses they couldn't afford with loan products that were downright (financially-speaking) stupid.Even in light of this and even considering that we recently sold our house and willingly become homeless for at least a year or so while we travel, I would not rule out purchasing a house again.  In fact, with house prices so low, now is an excellent time to buy a house if you are ready for one.  How do you know if you are ready?  Here's how:You can pay cash for a house (ideal).You can buy a house with a 15 year mortgage, a low interest rate, a good-sized down payment, and payments that will be no more than 25% of your net monthly income.You intend to stay in your house for at least ten years or longer.The house is located in a good area (good location, good schools, fairly stable housing base meaning not every other home on the block is a foreclosure).You have a houseful of kids you are providing for (living in an apartment with a houseful of kids is less than optimal.  It's nice not to have to worry about them stomping on the floor, yelling like maniacs, or doing all of the other things that kids do that tend to annoy apartment neighbors).You have the means to take care of the upkeep on the home (this means the money to hire projects done or the skill/time/energy to do it yourself).You are buying a reasonably-sized home that will suit your current and future needs.  I am hoping that the McMansions of the 1990s will become a thing of distant memory.  No family consisting of mom, dad, and 2.3 kids needs a 5,000 square foot house!  If you buy a house that will fit the kids now but still not be too big for you after the kids move out, you will be set.  Also, smaller houses are cheaper to heat, air condition, clean, decorate, and take care of.You are buying a house because you really, really want one, not because you are tempted by low payments/low interest rates or someone else tells you it is a good idea.You have faith that the market will rebound.  No one can tell you what the market will do but historically, the housing market always rebounds although it can take years for that to happen.  I tend to have faith that the housing market--and housing prices--will eventually make a turnaround.You realize that renting can save you money but you also realize that renting leaves you nothing in the end.  Historically the investment potential of buying a house has been a big impetus for people to buy houses and keep them in good condition so that when you retire or want to sell, you will be able to pull a little nest egg from the sale price which will fund your future.  Note that that hasn't happened in the last few years since house prices took a nose dive so, again, the buy and hold strategy seems to work best here.You aren't buying a house to \"flip\", you aren't timing the market (no one's crystal ball is that clear!), and you aren't investing and expecting a quick payday.  A house can be a good investment but like any investment, there are no guarantees!Hubby and I have tossed around the idea of buying a new home when we decide where we want to settle down again.  I have been a home owner since I was 19 and while it is more work and more expense than renting, I feel that it is, for the most part, well worth the effort and extra money.  I also like the feeling of being rooted and the idea that I don't have to answer to anyone about what color I paint the walls or how loud I play my music.  We will, of course, take all of the tings above into consideration when we do decide to buy."},

{"title": "A HUGE Congrats: The Family on Bikes Just Completed Their Epic Journey!", "date": "Tuesday, March 22, 2011", "text": "I'm sooo excited!  My favorite bicycling family just completed their epic journey from northern Alaska to the southern most tip of South America!!  I don't know about you, but when I was ten, our annual family vacation consisted of a week of camping in the mountains.  This family, however, decided to bicycle with their ten year old twins from practically the north pole to the south pole on a journey that took over three years to complete!  The boys will receive Guinness Book records for being the youngest people to complete such a feat and the entire family has kept me and many other readers entertained with their stories of life on the road via their blog and FaceBook page.As usual, I can't help but throw a few money tips in, so here is what I have learned from this amazing family:There is no goal too big if you just set your mind to it and keep putting one foot in front of the other...you will eventually reach your goal!This is yet another example of what you can do if you are debt free.The parents pulled some funds from their retirement plans to help pay for the trip.  Definitely a wise use of their money if you ask me.Their living expenses have been actually very low since they mainly buy food and some replacement gear/clothing.  What they don't buy are the typical consumer items that keep the average American family on the debt treadmill (ie: cars, a massive amount of clothes, a massive amount of toys for the kids, and all of the other typical junk that ends up cluttering our homes).This is the way to raise kids.  I'm not saying you need to pedal behind your kid for 17,300 miles, but all of the things they have done with their kids (setting a big goal, reaching a big goal, the physical challenge, relying on their kids to be an integral part of their team, etc) is the priceless stuff that builds kid's self esteem, keeps them out of trouble, teaches them how to be leaders in their family and with their peers, and sets them on the path for a lifetime of success.  If I could send every kid I have ever worked with in the juvenile justice system on this sort of adventure, we would have LOTS LESS troubled kids to take care of as a society.When the going gets tough, the tough get going.  They have had plenty of difficult times, plenty of challenges, and a couple times I thought they might quit but they just kept going and now they are celebrating in Ushuaia.  This is the same type of stuff that happens when you are trying to get out of debt.  I can't count the times that something broke or a big unexpected bill came up that wiped out our emergency fund and made me feel like all of the hard work just wasn't worth it.  Like this family, however, we persevered through the hard times and eventually all of our (and their) hard work paid off.Moral support, in all of its forms, is a good thing.  This family probably hasn't met most of the people who have been cheering them on throughout their journey.  Most probably stumbled across their blog or FaceBook page and joined in on the fun by offering comments and moral support as they traveled on their journey.  It's the same thing with many of the bloggers and others you \"meet\" online via the comments section or friends who have heard about whatever particular goal you have set for yourself, financial or otherwise.  Some will think you are insane when you declare such a big or life-changing goal, but the people who are the most important are the ones who will cheer you on to reach the goals that are important for you no matter how impossible seems."},
{"title": "How I Shop Now", "date": "Sunday, March 20, 2011", "text": "I've noticed that since we began the process of selling our house and nearly everything we owned then hitting the road, my shopping habits have changed drastically.  I used to make a list of stuff I needed then go to whatever store I happened to pass by and pick up everything on the list. I would look for sale items and maybe pull a manufacturer's coupon off the shelf but that was about as far as I went to save money on the things I bought.  I also tended to buy lots more things in addition to the stuff I had on my list.Now, not only do we buy a lot less stuff (living on the road and not having room to store stuff will do that for you) but the way I shop for the things we need has changed as well.  Now I make a list of things I need (soap, shampoo, makeup, etc) and then I start my shopping at the dollar store.  The dollar store is usually (not always) the cheapest place to buy stuff so everything that I can buy on my list at this store will save money over buying it at other stores.  For the things that I absolutely can't find at the dollar store, I then move on to Walmart (fortunately all of the stores I shop at are in the same general area).   If I can't find the things I need here, I will then usually head to Ross or TJ Maxx.  I will also shop at thrift stores depending on what items I am looking for.  A department store is the last place I will go to shop now.The reason I shop like this now is so that I can stretch my money as far as it will possibly go.  For example, I needed a mouse for my computer the other day.  I had checked the price of the mouse at Staples a couple of weeks ago but the price was around $25!  So, as is now my habit, I started at the dollar store.  They didn't have any mouses (mice?) at all so then I headed to Walmart.  Their prices were comparable to Staples which I thought was too high.  Next I went to Ross but they only had a cheap mouse that wasn't wireless so I walked next door to TJ Maxx and found the perfect wireless mouse for $7.99 in their small electronic section.  Score!We do basically the same thing for groceries.  We only buy loss leaders at regular grocery stores, we will occasionally buy food (usually snack type stuff) at the dollar store, and then we do the bulk of our shopping at a huge Asian store that we found which has excellent prices on most of the fruit, vegetables, and meat that we buy.Along with only buying what we can use in a short period of time instead of stockpiling stuff and only buying the items on the list and no extra stuff, this method of shopping has saved us a great deal of money over just buying everything at one store."},
{"title": "Hubby's Back Pain Cured...For Free!", "date": "Thursday, March 17, 2011", "text": "Hubby has had a bad back for ages.  Years ago he was in an industrial accident followed a year later by a pretty bad car wreck so in the words of his doctor, he now has the spine of a 90 year old.  Poor hubby.A couple of months ago as we were getting ready to sell the house, his on again, off again pain was suddenly on all the time.  I assumed it was because of the cold weather in Seattle along with all of the moving and lifting he was doing to get things ready to sell or store.  We figured that once we got to Atlanta, the warm weather and lack of lifting/moving things would help his back considerably.  Unfortunately this didn't happen and over the last month or so that we have been here, his back became even worse to the point he was in continual pain and taking Aleve daily.  We figured the next step would be to buy him a back brace to support his back, find him a local doctor to go to, get a referral to a physical therapist, and I even considered hunting him down an acupuncturist to work on him as well, his pain seemed that bad.Fast forward to a few nights ago when we were getting ready to go to bed and hubby commented that the mattress on our bed was much softer than our mattress at home (our mattress at home is a couple of steps down from a slab of wood!).  We wondered if the bed had anything to do with his increasing back pain so on a whim, we threw the bedding on the floor and decided to try sleeping on the carpeted floor for a night or two to see what would happen.Amazingly, the next morning after our first night of sleeping on the floor, hubby's back was MUCH better and by today he is walking around in near perfect condition.  He said he always has some sort of pain but since we have been sleeping on the floor he said his back feels much much better.  Yeah hubby.So I thought that since this worked so well for hubby I would throw it out there for others to try who are in the same situation (of course, best of all, it's a free fix!)."},
{"title": "Update: From the 'What Was I Thinking' File", "date": "Tuesday, March 15, 2011", "text": "We are a little more than one month into our travel adventure. So far it has been great! Relaxing. Little to no email. Haven't had to check my daily calendar in nearly a month. Things look to get a bit interesting however. Here's what's happening:We decided to extend our stay in Atlanta for a couple of more months to help out the hubby's sister who will be watching her two grandkids while her daughter is away at a two-month training. Even though the kids (age 2 and 4) will be going to daycare the few days a week that the SIL is at work, we will still be more or less watching them, taking them to daycare and activities, cooking for everyone, etc. On the plus side, we will be getting free room and board so this will save us three extra months worth of nearly all of our expenses besides what we would have been paying for an apartment. On the not so plus side, we haven't had to take care of little kids in decades! I think I forgot how! What was I thinking??I have also posted my goal to bike from Canada to Mexico this summer online and have a couple of people who are interested in going with me so I guess I really am going! Never mind that I haven't rode a bike more than a couple of miles in, again, decades. But I was so inspired by the Family on Bikes, that I though doing such a ride would be an epic adventure. What was I thinking?? p.s. This evening I will be attending a free bike repair class at the local REI so that is one small step in the direction of this goal.I also learned that when our schedule is so fluid and likely to change on nearly a daily basis like it is these day, buying NONREFUNDABLE airline tickets way ahead of time is a bad idea. Although the SIL will buy us new airline tickets to get us to our next destination after our time here is finished, the airline tickets we had previously bought (which we were supposed to use today) ended up going in the garbage because the $150 change fee plus the difference in the cost between the old ticket price and the new ticket price was way more than what new tickets would cost. It still seems like a huge waste of money to me, though. What was I thinking??We have also agreed to attend a family reunion in the Philippines in December. It should be a lot of fun. Our goal, however, is to save enough money to get all five kids, their spouses, and ten grandkids to the Philippines. All of hubby's brothers and sisters are doing the same. Talk about expensive! We usually do family reunions every four or five years in order to get ALL of hubby's family together (his mom started this years ago with her six kids. Since then the reunions have gown to include spouses, their kids and now grandkids). We used to meet at someone's house but since the family has grown so much we switched to going on cruises for the reunions because it really cuts down of the cooking and cleaning duty and this way everyone can hang out, or not, bond, etc. The last reunion in the Philippines was over 25 years ago and for good reason--it is super expensive to get there--however the cost of staying there (food and condo rental) are much cheaper than you pay in the US. So the plan is in place, I just need to win the lottery or something! What was I thinking?? So that's all that has been happening so far.  One of the best things about our travel adventure is that I am learning to be more flexible and open to whatever experiences come up (usually I am very Type A and need to have everything organized on my Outlook calendar).  So far, so good!"},
{"title": "10 Free/Cheap Ways to Prepare for the Next Disaster", "date": "Saturday, March 12, 2011", "text": "The pictures coming in from the huge disaster in Japan are just horrendous. I have a few friends in Tokyo whom I immediately texted right after I heard the initial reports of the earthquake yesterday and they were all able to text back to let me know they were OK. Talk about scary! The other scary thing is that a disaster like that can happen right here on our own soil as there are a number of earthquake faults running under the US (not to mention hurricanes, terrorist events, tornadoes, etc). Here's 10 free and cheap ways to prepare right now for a future disaster:FREE: hold regular earthquake drills, fire drills, evacuation drills, and communication drills with your family. This way, when a disaster actually happens, everyone will know exactly how to react because they have practiced so many times before.CHEAP: Each time you go to the store, buy an extra case of bottled/jugged water, especially if they are on sale. The first thing many people need after a disaster is drinkable water (and naturally, it is usually in short supply or not available at all in the affected disaster areas).CHEAP: Also when you are in the grocery store, pick up some sale food and put it aside for use during an emergency. Canned and packaged items that require little or no cooking are great to have on hand during a disaster. Note that emergencies can be of the natural disaster type (earthquake, tornado) or of the personal disaster type (job loss, extended illness).FREE: Make a family disaster plan so everyone will know what to do during an emergency.  Here's an example.CHEAP: Acquire the stuff you need to put together \"evacuation\" bags for each family member.  Each family member should have a bag that includes a change of clothes, a toiletry kit, a bit of cash, a bottle of water, some packaged food, a flashlight, a radio, and other items that would be useful if they needed to evacuate at a moments notice (see the list in #7).FREE:  Take advantage of free classes offered in your community that would teach you skills that would be useful during a disaster.  For example, our fire department offers free CPR classes, our Department of Emergency Management office offers free family disaster preparedness classes, and our local Red Cross offers free basic first aid classes. FREE:  Learn about what kinds of disasters could occur in your area and how to prepare for them.  Here's a good place to start.CHEAP:  Evaluate your home so that it can better withstand a disaster.  Something as simple as tying flat panel TVs and tall bookcases to the wall can go a long way towards mitigating damage during an earthquake.  Of course you can go even further and bolt your home to its foundation and do other more money and labor intensive projects.  Here's some more ideas.CHEAP:  Having a solid emergency fund isn't exactly cheap but during a disaster, you can always use cold, hard cash.  Everything from buying extra food, putting gas in the car, or evacuating to a hotel will be much easier if you have the cash on hand to do so.  Even putting $10 a week into your emergency savings can add up to quite a bit of money in a year.FREE: Watch these disaster preparedness videos.  They all offer excellent advice on how to survive a number of different disasters.Of course I am praying for everyone in Japan right now and this incident has only reinforced the idea that EVERYONE, no matter where they are or what their financial circumstances, can and must make the effort to prepare themselves in case the next disaster occurs in their neighborhood."},
{"title": "50 Tips: What to Do When You are Hungry and Have No Food", "date": "Thursday, March 10, 2011", "text": "Note: This post was updated in 2014.  Find the new post with updated information here.The number of people who are hungry these days seems to have grown exponentially. When it comes down to putting gas in the car or buying food, people often decide that gas to get to work is more important. However, you can't perform very well at work if your stomach is grumbling. Here's 50 tips for securing food when you are hungry:Skip restaurants. The $20 you pay for one meal at a restaurant could pay for a week's worth of food to eat at home. Yes, I know the $1 menu is popular but if you eat this kind of food every day for months on end you will die (not right away but it isn't good for your overall health).Dumpster dive. The bigger the city, apparently the better the pickings. There is a weekly free meal program in San Francisco made up entirely of dumpster-dived food. Cool.Sign up for food stamps if you qualify.Hit up your local food pantry for food you can take home and cook.Visit your local Salvation Army; they often provide free meals as well as food stuff to take home with you.Get a list of the free meal sites in your area and go. These are usually sponsored by churches and other social service organizations; all you have to do is show up and eat.Visit local churches, sometimes they can give you food or food vouchers.Forage for your own food. Depending on the season you can find nuts and berries, tree fruit, and mushrooms growing wild. You can also hunt for your own fish and small game.Check out the loss leaders for your local grocery stores. Many people base their entire meals on these highly discounted food items which are meant to lure into the store so you will buy other stuff. Just buy the cheap loss leaders and skip everything else.Shop in ethnic stores. Many ethnic grocery stores have super cheap prices on stapes, fruit, vegetables, and fish.Shop the day-old bakery rack in your grocery store and/or check out bakery outlet stores in your area for bargain basement bakery items.Check out how these people were able to feed themselves on a dollar a day: Example #1 Example #2 Example #3Make soup. Soup with whatever you have on hand can make a bigger, heartier meal than just cooking up the few items that you are putting into it. Ditto with stir-frys and casseroles.Call 211. This is a national number you can call and ask for help with any social service need that you have. They can direct you to places to get free food and free meals as well as many other services you may need.If you have an old Costco or Sams Club card, simply go into the stores and wander around the food aisles picking up food samples. Some days you can get a complete meal this way.Go to the mall or other community gathering place. Sometimes but not always you can score free food samples in the food court, free samples at events, and free items/coupons for new products that are being promoted.Crash events where there will be food: church socials, funerals, community meetings, community events, weddings, parties, etc.Trade work for food. If you walk by a restaurant that has dirty windows, for example, offer to clean the windows in trade for a meal.Go to the Assistance section of Reddit and ask for help--many, many people have been helped by generous redditors.If you live in a farming area, ask the farmer if you can glean his fields after the harvest.Choose a full time or part time job that offers free food as a benefit (many restaurants, coffee shops, and bars give their employees a free meal each day they work).Go an a date! My friend finds all of her dates through online dating sites. They often take her out for dinner and pick up the tab (not sure how well this would work for guys though).Check out Freecycle and the free section of CraigsList, pick up some items for free, then resell them at your own garage sale (people have been known to do this, fix the item up a bit, then relist it for sale on CraigsList too). Use the money earned for food.Shop in the bulk bin section of the grocery store. Here you can pick up a pound of rice and a pound of beans for a dollar and have food for a week!Cook from scratch. Skip the expensive processed foods and make your own breads, soups, casseroles, etc. It is generally much cheaper to make things from scratch than to buy pre-made items.Have people you can fall back on for food. When I was a starving college student, I knew that every time I went to grandma's house she would have a hot meal waiting for me (of course I would have visited her meal or no but this was definitely a bonus!).Panhandle on a street corner. Most people would say \"no way\" to this but if you and your kids are actually starving, this may be the most expedient way to get some cash together to buy food.If you have ever served in the military, check out your local military service center, DAV, or VFW hall and see what resources are available to you.If you are a senior citizen, see what services you qualify for (there are many senior-only meal sites in our area as well as a free meal delivery program specifically for seniors).If you are a tribal member, check with your tribe's social service office to see what services (food as well as others) that you qualify for.Shop at the Dollar Store. You need to know your prices, of course, as some items can be had for less than a dollar at other stores, however Dollar Stores can have some great prices on food.Sign your kids up for the free meal program at school if you qualify. This will reduce the amount of food you will need at home to feed them. Note that schools often have free meal programs during the summer when school isn't in session to ensure that kids get a good meal or two each day (breakfast and lunch).Google for ideas. People are always coming up with new and interesting ways to save money of food costs. By Googling the topic, you will find many ways to cut food costs (try terms such as 'save money on food', 'cut food costs', 'eating for cheap or free', etc).Pay attention to unit prices. When you are spending your hard-earned money on food, you want to make sure you are getting the best deal possible. Compare prices by unit (cost of ounce by ounce or pound by pound which is usually located on the shelf tag) to get the best deal possible.Use coupons. You can find coupons in newspaper ad sections, online, and even at the grocery store itself. It takes a while to create a coupon \"system\" but you could end up like this lady. Be sure to use store loyalty cards as well to get sale prices on the food you buy.Buy in bulk. With some items, you can pay much less by buying in bulk. My favorite item to buy in bulk is a giant box of oatmeal for around $7 at Costco. This could last me for months!Make a price book. It takes a bit of work to put together a food price book but some people swear by this method of keeping track of prices on the food their family most commonly uses. This way you will be able to know for sure what a \"good price\" is on the food items you buy.Grow your own food. Obviously this isn't a quick fix to your hunger problems but if you have a patch of land and a bit of know how, the cost of buying a packet of seeds (around $1 on sale) can pay off handsomely at the end of the growing season (just make sure you have a way to store the excess!).Write to food manufacturers. When I find a product I like, I have, in the past, written to the food company to rave about their product. Often they send me coupons, product samples, and the like just because I took the time to shot them off a quick letter or email.On the other hand, be sure to rant about a food product if you have just cause (this works when corresponding with food companies as well as at restaurants). Usually the company wants to make it right and will reward your efforts with free products, coupons, etc. Know where you can get the most \"bang for your buck\" in the food aisle. Eggs, rice, beans, peanut butter, bananas...you want to spend your limited supply of cash on items that are reasonably healthy, reasonably cheap, and reasonably filling.Go generic or store brand. Many people who have been used to just tossing (highly advertised) food in their cart may feel like generics and store brands are some how beneath them. Not true. Most items are exactly like the highly advertised products, only much cheaper.Shop local. Try Farmer's Markets, especially at the end of the day, to get great prices on nutritious food.Take advantage of freebies. This site lists every restaurant that will give you a free meal/menu item on your birthday. Other places give out freebies on certain days (ie: Ben and Jerry's has a \"free cone\" day).\"Potluck\" with others. If each person brings one dish, you will all eat like kings.Scour the internet or library for ethnic food recipes (Asian, Indian, Mexican, etc). In most countries they don't eat like we do in America (ie: the notion that you need a slab of meat on your plate at every meal and a big hunk of carbs). Ethnic cooking tends to focus on meals you can feed a large family for cheap (ie: rice, beans, soups, etc). Take a multi-vitamin. A bottle of vitamins will cost around $10 for a month. This will help make up for any nutritional deficiencies you may have when eating so cheaply.Think attitude and presentation. My Depression-era grandmother could feed the family a simple plate of beans and rice and we would think we were feasting. Mostly it was her positive attitude (\"look at the wonderful meal I cooked just for you\") and the presentation (beautiful plates, multiple \"courses\" like we were eating in a fancy restaurant when we were actually eating bean soup, beans and tortillas, beans and hocks, etc).Look for cheaper alternatives. If you were used to eating T Bones steaks, find a much cheaper cut of beef and roast it for hours until it is tender. If you were used to getting skinless, boneless chicken breasts for dinner, buy a whole chicken on sale and use every part of it.Learn to barter. You can trade just about anything (ie: friend shoots a deer, you offer to butcher it for him and keep part of the animal) and with enough practice as well as contacts with other barterers, you could very well end up with much more than you started with.That's about all I can think of off the top of my head. Any more ideas I missed?"},
{"title": "The New Computer (Of Course, Money Saving Tips Included)", "date": "Wednesday, March 9, 2011", "text": "Since we have decided to extend our stay with the SIL for a few more months, I was feeling pretty sorry for hubby who had left his bigger laptop behind in the storage unit in favor of bringing his easy-to-carry netbook with him. Granted the netbook is great for traveling because it is so small, but on the other hand, hubby streams his TV shows from Asia every day and he could barely see the people's faces on his tiny netbook. So off we went to Staples and bought him a basic yet fully functional Toshiba computer for a grand total of $399. The SIL went shopping with us and was properly mortified that we would buy a super cheap computer. She even carted us over to the Apple store to try to convince us that a MacBook Pro was the way to go. Now, a few years ago we would have clamoured for the coveted Apple computer and quickly swiped the credit card to the tune of $1500 plus then worried about how to pay the bill for the next dozen months or so but these days we are working on a cash-only basis and we have learned that if we spend all of our cash, we won't have any more to spend on other things that may come up. Here's what we did:We checked the ads for Staples, Best Buy, Office Max, Office Depot, and Newegg to get an idea of the prices and types of computers that were available on sale. I also clicked on the customer reviews for the sale computers to see what other people had to say about them.  Staples seemed to have the best prices so we went to the store to get a look at what they were offering.We looked at a variety of computers with prices from $379 to $899. After determining what he actually needed the computer for (turns out not much, as he only uses his computer for watching television shows online, playing free online poker, and checking email once in a blue moon), we decided that the basic 4 gb/320 gb hard drive, 15\" laptop would be perfect). Of course saving money was also at the top of our requirements along with getting a good basic computer, not an old or poorly rated computer). He chose the Toshiba which met all of his specs. It was a well reviewed computer that was on sale for $399 which kind of sealed the deal. Would he have liked the nice Apple computer? Of course, however we didn't think that it would be five times better than the Toshiba so it wasn't worth it to us to pay five times more money for it.We got the laptop home and I proceeded to set it up. This included firing it up, registering it, then going into the add/remove program control panel and deleting all of the \"crapware\" off of it.Next I clicked on 'windows update' and loaded the 50+ updates onto the computer (a long process with a low strength wireless connection!).I then loaded Open Office onto the computer. The hubby may type a document once a year so doesn't need much in the way of an office suite. I have found the free Open Office program to be perfect for his needs.I then went to Download.com and loaded the following FREE programs: AVG (anti virus), Ad Aware (internet security program), and VLC (a good media player).Next I added other free programs that he uses: Chikka (for texting friends in Asia), Absolute Poker (free online poker), and Full Tilt Poker (hubby likes poker).That's it! Now hubby has been happily watching his shows today while not having to squint at them. The computer works great, and at such a low price, we won't feel bad if we end up giving it to a grandkid sometime during our travels.The moral of the story is that while it is nice to go top of the line, it isn't necessary. If he was a hard-core gamer/programmer/coder then we may have chosen differently but when you look at what you are buying, what you actually need the item for, and the price for what you are getting, you can be perfectly happy with a basic item that gets the job done.And some side notes: If you have a non profit, Tech Soup rocks!  It provides very good software at super low prices (like MS Office Pro for $30!!!).Other programs that I add to my computers: Skype, Yahoo Messenger, Firefox, Omni Format/PDF 995, drivers for my digital camera/printer/mini camcorder, and iTunes.And a great solution to viruses: Occasionally I get a virus on my computer no matter how careful I am so here is how I fix it: turn off the computer, turn it back on and hit the F8 button repeatedly until you see a DOS screen.  Arrow down to 'start computer in safe mode with networking'.  The computer will start but the screen will look a little funny.  Click on start, all programs, system tools, system restore.  Click on restore computer to a date before you started having problems with your computer.  Follow the steps and your computer will be restored.  It will turn off then come back on to its original condition and you will have gotten rid of the virus.  Also, any documents you have downloaded or changed will stay the same and won't be deleted.  Works like a charm!For everything computer-related that I want to know, I first Google my query (this is how I learned about the virus fix above).  If that doesn't get me the answers I need, I go to reddit and type in my question there (someone in their many hundred thousand hive mind will know the answer)."},
{"title": "Money Saving Habits", "date": "Monday, March 7, 2011", "text": "I think it is not until you live with other people that you realize the habits that you subconsciously perform day in and day out without even thinking about them can be a bit...odd. Apparently I have a lot of odd habits because they have been commented on. Often. Here's my list of odd (but money saving!) habits:When I do laundry, I use about a quarter of the recommended soap. My clothes aren't really dirty plus the water here is soft which means it takes more effort to rinse the soap out of the clothes so less soap is a good thing.I always cut dryer sheets in half. I like the anti-cling part of the sheets but I'm not a fan of overly perfumed things so cutting the sheets in half seems to be ideal.I use leftovers religiously. Many people will save leftover food then end up tossing it out eventually. I tend to base the next day's meals on whatever was leftover from the night before.I use one tea bag for two cups of tea each morning for the hubby and I instead of a tea bag for each cup. It seems to work just fine.When shopping I love the day-old bread rack, the discounted items bin, the loss leaders, and other sale items. Also, I tend to buy generic/store brands for many items (there are some store branded items I don't care for but most store brands are impossible to tell from highly advertised national brands).I often like to make my own food items from scratch (ie: we were at the grocery store with my sister in law and she was going to spend $5 on a small tub of hummus, I told her I could make a great hummus for less than a dollar from scratch). I do this for many products which seem horribly expensive compared to the \"from scratch\" price.Whenever shampoo, conditioner, or laundry soap gets nearly empty, I always add some water and shake. I like being able to use every last drop of a product.Whenever soap gets to be too thin to use, I get the next bar of soap lathery then smoosh the older sliver of soap on top, then let it dry; that way I can use every last scrap of the soap.When we go out to eat, hubby and I always split a meal. We don't do this so much because of the money, although this does save a lot of money, but because when we realized that we were never able to eat the trough-sized portions of food that was served to us, we decided it just made sense to split the meal. Also, we only drink water at restaurants, in fact we only drink water at all meals...it's a long-time habit.We don't drink alcohol of any sort (no wine, no beer, no hard alcohol) just because neither one of us likes the taste of alcohol. Between the two of us, this is just normal behaviour but it seems like ALL of our friends have the habit of wine with dinner or a beer after work. I love to use coupons, always send in rebates, and always ask for discounts (ie: senior discount for hubby, military discount when I know it is offered, etc). It's like free money and I seriously hate to pay full retail prices!When the door squeaked, I sprayed a dab of Pam cooking spray on it. It works!When I bake, I tend to bake a lot of different things at the same time. I figure it saves money on heating and reheating the oven.Well, that all of the odd habits I have been made aware of recently. I think I picked up many of these things from my depression-era grandmother who used to do these things and more to save money."},

{"title": "5 Critical Financial Moves That Put Us on the Road to Solvency", "date": "Tuesday, March 1, 2011", "text": "Just a few short years ago we were mired in debt and it looked like I would be working until I was 90.  Obviously we were doing everything wrong financially that you could think of but we were so comfortable in our rut that we didn't know, or didn't want to know, what to do to get out of it.Then I found Dave Ramsey, listened to his show religiously, made some (many) changes, and now today we have our debts paid off and I was recently able to quit working and travel for a while until we decide what to do next. These are the five critical changes we made that, without which, we would still be up to our eyeballs in debt:Pay cash for a car and drive it until it dies.  For many years we leased cars, had insanely high car payments, and just thought that was the way that everyone did it.  Today we have one car, it is paid off, and we will drive it until it dies and not a moment sooner.  I think car debt is the number one change that people could make in their financial lives that would immediately put them on the road to solvency.Don't use credit cards.  Aside from car debt, we also had the habit of running up our credit cards (there were many) as high as the banks would allow (and when that didn't work we would call the banks and grovel for a credit limit increase which they would often grant).  The amount of unsecured debt we had on credit cards was ridiculously stupid but we had no one to blame but ourselves.  Today we pay cash for everything and have paid off our credit cards.  Hubby has one credit card that we don't use (he feels more secure with it for some reason) and I have no credit cards (and no desire to ever have one again).  There is absolutely no reason you, or anyone else, should be guaranteeing your future income to buy something you want today, at 20%+ interest no less.Don't eat out.  Again, we had the high-flying lifestyle with the cool cars, the crazy credit card debt, and the major shopping sprees.  With all of this debt, we were also working like maniacs just to tread water with these debts which meant we weren't often home which meant we both--along with the kids--ate out literally every day.  Often we would eat all three meals out.  Needless to say this was an expensive habit that only served to rack up credit card debt even faster (and it certainly wasn't healthy either).  Now I see that eating at home can save SO MUCH money.  For example, feeding a family of four dinner out at a restaurant can easily run $50 to $80, for one meal.  For that much money, you can feed the same family of four at home for an entire week!Have an emergency fund.  When you have a huge amount of debt, everything is a financial crisis.  Until I heard about Dave Ramsey, I had never heard of the concept of having an emergency fund.  When Dave said that you need an emergency fund so that if an emergency arises you don't have to use your credit card to cover it, it was like a light bulb went on in my head.  Duh.  Since I put together my emergency fund, as Dave had predicted, we have never had to put a financial crisis on our credit cards because we had the cash to cover it.  This allowed us to pay off our credit cards once and for all.  If you don't have a \"starter emergency fund\" of $1,000, you need to do this today.No. More. Shopping.  I used to shop recreationally.  My friends and I would run to the mall during lunch, I would see someone with a new purse, think I needed one, and cruise by the mall after work to pick one up.  The hubby and I would spend our weekends walking around Costco, the mall, and other big box stores being subtly convinced that we needed more and more stuff to be happy.  Needless to say, that kind of hobby can bury you in debt faster than just about anything else.  Today we shop only when we absolutely need something and there is no more aimlessly wondering around a store just because we are bored.  I also don't feel compelled to shop just because I see someone else with a new purse or new shoes and I don't equate my self esteem and \"status\" with what I own.With those simple steps, we were able to dig ourselves out of the mound of debt we had buried ourselves under for years.  It really is that simple.  Yes, your ego may take a hit when you drive up in a car that is older than your kids, when your purse is so many seasons old it can't be identified, or when you have to opt out of the expensive restaurant meal with friends because \"that's the place you have always gone to\" but it no longer fits in your budget, however the feeling of freedom that comes with being debt free more than makes up for any temporary ego problems you may have."},
{"title": "10 Kitchen Items I Love/10 I Don't Want or Need", "date": "Monday, February 28, 2011", "text": "One of the fun things about cooking at my sister-in-law's house is that she owns nearly every kitchen item that is/has been sold at Macy's and, she has an amazing collection of spices and unusual foods. That makes cooking extra interesting. For me, however, there are plenty of popular kitchen items that I simply don't want or need.Here's my list of cooking implements that I can't live without:My grandmother's cast iron pan and cast iron dutch oven. I LOVE cooking in these pans! The bonus is that they have been seasoned for over sixty years.A blender. I use a blender nearly everyday for making smoothies, sauces, soups, and other tasty items.A good set of heavy bottom pans. When I was in college, I bought the cheapest set of pans I could find. I then promptly burned nearly everything I cooked in them. A good set of pans is priceless.A toaster-convection oven. Hubby had to convince me that we needed this small counter-top oven but once I started using it, I didn't want to part with it. It heats up much quicker than our regular oven, cooks much faster (since it is convection), saves energy over the cost of using the regular oven, and is the perfect size to cook for two (ie: bake a half chicken, heat up bread for two, etc).A small but useful set of cooking utensils. For some reason, we stick some utensils in the drawer and they tend to multiply. And multiply. All I really need are a few good knives (paring, chopping, cleaver), my grandmother's wooden spoon, a good vegetable peeler, a basic rolling pin, a good spatula (there is a difference between a \"good\" and a \"bad\" spatula), a sturdy whisk, and a couple of large spoons. That's all I need. A small rice cooker. Since rice is a must in our house every day, we must have a rice cooker. Just a small, basic rice cooker works fine for us.A toaster. Even though we have a toaster oven, nothing toasts better than a good toaster. An all purpose mixing bowl. I have a favorite mixing bowl that went into storage with the other few items I didn't want to part with. There are plenty of bowls out there but when you find the 'perfect' one, you want to hang onto it.A set of baking pans. I tend to bake quite a bit and I have a small collection of baking pans (bread pans, cookie sheets, oblong pans) that I just love.A great cutting board. For some reasons I am pretty picky about cutting boards.Some are too rough and some are too slippery. I had a really nice cutting board that hubby ran the Skillsaw through (he was cutting ox tails, yes, with a Skillsaw, and forgot the cutting bard was underneath and cut the thing in half!). So I will need to find another 'perfect' cutting board when we decide where to settle.And then there are the things that \"everyone\" says I should have but which I don't even want in my kitchen. Among the items:A dishwasher. I much prefer to wash dishes by hand as I find they get cleaner that way. Every dishwasher I have owned has ended up being an expensive drying rack.An expensive coffee maker which uses even ore expensive \"cuplets\". You probably know what I am talking about. We had a small, cheap, $10 coffee maker from Walmart for years and it worked fine for hubby's morning coffee.A Kitchen Aid mixer. Everyone I know has one of these, mostly because they come in cute colors and matches their kitchens. Hubby wanted to buy me one of these many times since I do a lot of baking but each time I would refuse because I much prefer using a cheap mixer or even a whisk for mixing thing and I much prefer using my hands when I am mixing bread dough (how else to know when it is perfectly kneaded?). Then when you take into account how long it takes to take it apart and clean it after use...A slow cooker. Some people swear by their slow cookers. I have only used one a couple of times and decided I didn't much care for it so this is one item I don't need.A bread machine. This item was super popular a few years back. I guess I am old fashioned in that, if I am going to bake bread, I want to make it completely by hand.A Seal a Meal. I think these are clever machines, but I feel that they take much more effort than a simple ziploc bag.Gadgets. Walk through any kitchen store and you will find an armload of gadgets for every little purpose. Most of these items are for a single use and are really unnecessary. 50 different pans, 50 different bowl, 50 different utensils. In looking at many people's kitchen, it seems like they think if one item is good, then ten must be better. Since I'm a minimalist, I disagree.A popcorn popper, a waffle iron, a juicer, a food dehydrator, a deep fryer...there are plenty of items that seem useful when you first look at them. I know I have bought my share of \"wow that will be really useful\" items only to find that I rarely, if ever, used them. Now if I want to dehydrate a batch of apples, I use the oven. If I want to make egg rolls, I fry them in my cast iron pan. You get the idea... Plug-in appliances. There are so many specific \"plug in\" appliances that one can buy. A plug-in wok, a plug-in pan, a plug-in specially oven. These appliances seem very redundant to what most basic appliances (ie: an oven or a stove with a pan on it) can do."},
{"title": "What Can You Do With a Gallon of Milk?", "date": "Sunday, February 27, 2011", "text": "That was the question I was wondering last week when I went to the store for a half gallon of milk for some cooking I was doing. When I checked the prices, however, I noticed that a half gallon of milk cost $1.97 and a gallon of milk cost $2. Hmmm I figured for an extra three cents, I would figure out what to do with all of that milk because it seemed like a waste of money not to buy the gallon. This is what I did:Saved half a gallon of milk for cooking, baking, and drinking for everyone in the household (none are big milk drinkers but there were quite a few recipes I was trying out that required milk).Made yogurt out of the other half gallon of milk. Making yogurt is so simple! I thought you had to have some kind of magical cooking ability but my friend always told me how cheap and simple it was for her to make yogurt for her family so one day I decided to give it a try and now I am a convert too. To make yogurt simply put together a double boiler (one pan that fits inside another pan with enough room for water between the two pans). Heat the milk to near boiling. Cool the milk to about 95 degrees. Mix in a couple of tablespoons of yogurt from your last batch (you can do this about five or six times before you need to go to the store and get a small container of plain yogurt for the starter). Pour the milk into containers and set it somewhere warm for about eight to ten hours (sometimes I set it on a heating pad covered with a towel, other times I set it in the windowsill on a warm day, sometimes I will put it in the oven and turn the oven on occasionally to keep it toasty warm in there--note if you don't pay attention you can forget to turn off the oven after a few minutes and melt the containers all over the oven--this is why I prefer the heating pad!).With the yogurt made, I put half of the yogurt in the fridge and took the other half of the batch of yogurt and strained it (line a sieve with coffee filters and put the yogurt on top of the filters). After five hours of draining over a bowl in the fridge, you get \"yogurt cheese\" which is kind of like cream cheese and can be used accordingly.Recipes: with either the yogurt or yogurt cheese, you can mix in garlic powder or finely chopped garlic and a bit of dried dill and have a tasty \"tzatziki\" like dressing. You can also mix mashed strawberries with the yogurt cheese and have a wonderful spread for bagels."},
{"title": "How to Beat the High Cost of Driving", "date": "Thursday, February 24, 2011", "text": "Well this article certainly got my attention. Even though we are traveling now and many of our expenses are paid for, we still get to put gas in whatever cars we use so when I saw that gas prices could climb to $5 this summer, it got me a little freaked out. For someone who still clearly remembers when gas cost less than $1 per gallon, $5 per gallon (or a whopping $100+ per fill up) seems super high. Yikes.The last time that gas prices went through the roof (about 2008), I mostly swore off driving. I bought a bus pass, rearranged my schedule, and also started walking and riding my bike more. Looks like those days will soon be back. The unfortunate affect of this increase in gas prices is that it will also affect nearly every other part of our lives as well--the cost to transport groceries will increase, the price for building materials will increase, the cost of toys--and everything else made out of plastic--will increase, getting to and from work will cost more, flying will cost more, even the cost of a styrofoam container for your take out food will cost more because oil impacts just about every manufacturing process there is. Here's how we, even now, try to reduce our fuel costs:We ride the bus whenever possible (a monthly bus pass is much cheaper than filling your car up every week).We walk or ride our bikes to do local errands.We try to buy locally-produced food (this saves the cost of all things related to food from the cost of fertilizer to the cost of transporting the food to the grocery store. Plus it is usually more nutritious as well!).We car pool whenever possible. Now the hubby and I are pretty much together most of the time but before, when I was working, we could sometimes get four or five people who were going to the same meetings to car pool together--that saved a lot of gas!We simply stay home. Depending on your situation, this may or may not be an option, but for many people, especially on weekends, their first inclination is to get up and get out of the house, driving somewhere to shop, eat, or otherwise entertain themselves. If you stay home, you don't use gas. Simple.Our vacations will be much closer to home in order to beat the high cost of fuel (I think the term 'staycation' was coined during the last gas price increase).We throw on an extra sweater instead of jacking up the thermostat when it is cold (our house was heated with natural gas).We try to use all resources minimally because almost everything we do uses power generated by fuel (ie: shorter showers, heating the room we are in instead of the whole house, using a small counter-top oven for baking instead of the large oven, etc).I think that as prices continue to rise, everyone will start looking at ways to conserve fuel which really isn't a bad thing. In fact it is something that we should have been doing a long time ago. Most countries have already learned this. In Japan, a country where natural resources are scarce, it is second nature to the people there to not be wasteful of anything--water, fuel, food, etc. This is how we all should be."},
{"title": "A Health Update and My 10 Health Rules", "date": "Wednesday, February 23, 2011", "text": "I was planning on writing this post as soon as I got the results back from some medical tests.The bad news: the week before we were getting ready to move, the results of my \"girly parts\" test (Pap) came back abnormal for a second time. My doctor and everyone in the clinic knew we were getting ready to leave for a minimum of six months of travel and fortunately they are awesome. So two days before we moved out of our house, I had a consultation with my doctor about the further tests I would need. One day before we moved, I met with another doctor who would do the biopsy and other tests. The day of our move I had some biopsies done (then quickly went home and finished packing and cleaning up just as the new homeowners were on their way to our house). Talk about stress!The good news: today my doctor called and said the biopsies and other tests came back fine so I would just need to come back for another exam in six months. Yeah! Happy!Needless to say, during the ensuing couple of weeks I have been a bit stressed, worrying about all of the horrible results that the doctor could call me with. Also, however, during the past two weeks, I have become a health zealot. The idea that I have been treating my body like a garbage can pretty much resonated through my brain on a daily basis for the past couple of weeks. So I have turned over a new leaf and am ultra aware of the responsibility I need to take for my health. Here's the ten health rules I now abide by:Get regular health exams. Getting a physical on an annual basis will allow your doctor to catch any problems when they are small, not at a later--and more difficult to treat--stage. Fortunately I have great health insurance but the cost for health exams for people who don't have insurance can be a real barrier to staying on top of health issues. For women (or at least their \"girly parts\"), many local and state health departments offer free Pap and mammogram tests for women over 40 (call your local or state health department or Google for the information). I have volunteered to help out at these events for many years and thought it was a good service, I didn't realize how, when you get scary test results back, these free services aren't just a nice idea but critical for a woman's future health.Exercise daily. When all of this happened, I decided I needed to take better care of my health starting ASAP. Since that day, I have launched myself out of bed every morning and walked three miles, every day, seven days a week. Walking is free and it isn't hard to do but I used to be so busy/lazy that I would make excuses not to exercise or even walk around the block. Now I walk three miles each day rain or shine (outside or on the treadmill or at the mall when it is rainy). Best of all, this is FREE!Take vitamins every day. This is another thing I was usually too lazy to do, but how hard is it to take one multi vitamin a day? Now I put the vitamin jar (and a couple of other supplements that I need) right next to the water I will drink when I get back from walking.Food, part 1. Don't drink your calories. I had heard this phrase somewhere but--as I was sipping on my Starbucks--disregarded it. I figured that I drank maybe 500-800 calories a day what with my daily Frapuccino and other beverages. Now it is water and the occasional green tea. Only. I am happy to report that since I initially got the results of my abnormal test back, I stopped Starbucks cold turkey (and probably saved about $200 a month by doing so).Food, part 2. Eat as close to natural food as possible. Now when I look at the food I eat, I think \"is this the healthiest food I can eat or is it available in a more natural format?\" This has resulted in me eating lots more fresh fruit and vegetables (raw, sometimes steamed, never fried, but I'll make an exception when I come across fried green tomatoes), no refined sugar/flour/other refined products if at all possible, and better quality food.Food, part 3. I stay away from food that I know doesn't work well with my body. This includes gluten (most flour products are out), dairy (I love dairy but I was having way too much of it, now it is a treat and not a daily staple), chocolate (in my case, this creates instant zits...ick), and caffeine (I had such mood swings when I used to eat coffee ice cream for example, that it was clearly not good for my body). Note: not eating junk food gives you much more energy and saves a lot of money too!Get all the sleep you need. Fortunately all of this occurred during a down time. Since I am not working right now, I have all of the time in the world to sleep and getting eight hours is much easier now than when I had early morning meetings, project deadlines that caused me to work late hours, or stress that would interrupt my sleep.And then there is stress. Since my email dropped from more than a hundred messages a day to about five, I haven't had to look at my calendar in over a month, and (other than this health scare), literally nothing is happening these days, my stress level has dropped considerably. For my health, this is a good thing.Positive people can have a positive impact on your health. Most books on health include a chapter on having a social support network as this has been shown to improve health, reduce stress, and make you happier overall. Quitting work has allowed me to drop all of the office drama and people problems and now I am surrounded by a few fun, happy people so I couldn't ask for more in this department. The hubby is also an amazingly positive, happy person who keeps me positive and happy as well.All the other good-for-health stuff: on a daily basis I get plenty of fresh air, sunshine, and fun new experiences. I read Daily Word and pray each day (spiritual health is important too), and try to keep a positive attitude.Here's to your health!"},
{"title": "I Complain, Therefore I Am", "date": "Monday, February 21, 2011", "text": "I wouldn't say I complain ALL the time but my pet peeve is poor customer service so yes, I guess I can get a bit ranty when I am unhappy.  A couple of days ago I was unhappy, thus this post. I was looking for a great barbecue place which I heard Georgia has plenty of so I immediately went to Yelp because if hundreds of people say a place is good, it usually is.  We found Jim and Nicks Barbecue which was highly rated by everyone who chimed in on Yelp (it is a chain but all of their ratings were four stars or higher so we decided to try it out).The food was good but in the reviews everyone raved about the cheese corn muffins that they continuously bring to your table.  We received two small muffins each, none when we asked for more, and the waitress, as my husband put it, \"was friendly to everyone...except us\".  Eek.At the end of the meal a lady who said she was the maitre'd in training came to see how our meal was so as tactfully as possible I told her I was a little disappointed that it didn't live up to the wonderful reviews it had received.  I also told her I had looked forward to the famous corn muffins but the tiny sample we received were all we got even when we asked for more.  Immediately the lady was apologetic (southern people have such a friendly tone of voice, it pretty much makes you not want to argue as opposed to, say New York...but I digress...). Within a couple of minutes we had a big batch of muffins in a to go container (she saw that we were finished with our meal) and she gave us a piece of lemon meringue pie for dessert at no charge.Needless to say, I was super impressed with how she responded to my complaint and we will definitely eat there again.Overall, I think that businesses want to do a good job.  Sometimes an employee is having a bad day, sometimes the business gets overwhelmed and understaffed, sometimes things just don't work out well but it is always a win-win situation when, if the customer is unhappy, they give the business a chance to rectify the situation, and if the management hears of a problem, they get the chance to fix it instead of having disgruntled customers leave with a bad opinion of a place.So now I am back to happy and looking forward to my next plate of barbecue!"},

{"title": "The (Economical) Sabbatical", "date": "Thursday, February 17, 2011", "text": "While the hubby often tells people that I am now retired, I figure that at 43 I still have a few working years left. So I am looking at this break as more of a sabbatical than as a permanent retirement. Sabbaticals are common in the education profession, but I saw this wonderful TED presentation about a business owner who takes a year off, even closing his business while he is gone, every seven years for the purpose of rejuvenation and becoming re-inspired which not only is great for him personally but also for his business. So I am officially on sabbatical and have established the following goals:It can't cost a lot. Obviously for the sabbatical to work you need to be able to fund the time off. This can be done by #1, not having debt payments to make while you are on sabbatical, and #2, carefully spending your money during your time off so you don't end up with more time off than money.I want to focus on my health. When I am working I can put together dozens of excuses to not exercise mainly because my schedule was so crazy I couldn't get into a rhythm for exercising. I may exercise four days in a row but then have two days crammed full of meetings and immediately fall off the exercise wagon. Now I have NOTHING to do which means that as soon as I wake up each morning I head out the door and walk three miles. This is perfect because it is free, I have a beautiful place to walk, and there is sunshine which is inspirational in itself.Also as part of improving my health (as well as being a good house guest) I am cooking everyday. This saves money (eating out costs a lot!), it is much more healthful (I know exactly what ingredients I am using and opt for the healthiest ingredients possible), and I am learning how to cook Southern food (my sister-in-law's fiance is a Southern boy born and bred so he gets to test all of my cooking to see if it measures up...he even gave me his granddad's secret cornbread recipe!).I get to sleep! This is also free and again, with no meetings/appointment/projects on deadline, I can actually sleep eight plus hours per night! That in itself is super rejuvenating.I am enjoying time to just slow down and be. Compared to my previously insane schedule, this gives me plenty of time to become inspired. Learning and inspiration can be found anywhere and be found relatively cheaply or even free. On my list of things to do: go to Sunday service at a traditional African American church, see the Georgia Guidestones, and maybe take a side trip to Memphis for some blues and ribs. Basically what I do is research things that are tourist attractions/happening in the area as well as stay open to any opportunities that come up (for example, my SIL invited me to a tour of the CDC today which was interesting**). I really think that I will come back from this experience more relaxed, refreshed, and hopefully with some wonderful new business ideas!A sabbatical should be de rigour for everyone. Most people never take any time off for themselves and instead go straight from high school to college to the world of work with hardly more than a week or two of vacation each year. By taking an honest-to-goodness sabbatical even if you need to pinch pennies when you do so and enjoy more free stuff than expensive, scheduled events, the time spent on rejuvenating yourself can be priceless!**I moved my other blog from Tumblr (again) back to Blogger (again) so if you want to find out about our travels, you can find my travel blog at http://mosttraveledme.blogspot.com/."},
{"title": "In the Land of Excess", "date": "Wednesday, February 16, 2011", "text": "We are spending a wonderful month with my sister-in-law north of Atlanta. The weather here is perfect, the food is awesome, did I mention how nice the weather is? That's the Seattleite in me--very unused to nice weather especially at this time of year!After getting rid of nearly all of our worldly possessions, however, this place seems to magnify the difference between the spartan lifestyle we have adopted and the magnificent excess of most everyone else.It may be the area she lives in (wealthy), or it may be the sudden realization that I used to be exactly like these people (shopping til I dropped...repeatedly), or maybe I am just more aware of things that I need as opposed to things that I want. Whatever it is, I am supremely grateful for her generosity (free room and more food than we can ever eat) as we stick a toe into this new vagabonding lifestyle. Here's the things that \"everyone\" seems to have here (and the things that I am pretty happy I no longer have):A massive shoe collection (I hope she doesn't see this picture but I saw her shoes lining the entire garage--because one of her walk-in closets is already overflowing with shoes--and I had to take a picture). Currently I own five pairs of shoes.  The shoes cover everything I need--from exercising to dancing to dressing \"smart casual\"--but I do love shoes and if I had more room I probably would have kept a few more pairs.  Not this many pairs though.A continual outflow of money: for the yard guy, the pool guy, the bug guy, the housekeeper, not to mention house payments, credit card payments, a daily run to Costco. Yikes. Granted she can easily afford this but I am glad that our lifestyle has been drastically scaled back and I don't have to worry about the yard, cleaning the house, etc. Driveways full of cars. We used to have more than a half dozen cars...they seemed to multiply after the kids started driving. Now we have one paid-for car and a couple of bus passes. Note that there is absolutely NO public transportation system here so a car is more or less a necessity.  I didn't realize how much money and effort it took to have a car until I got rid of mine.  I figured that I saved about $800 a month on the car and at least five or six hours of effort each month (cleaning it, oil changes, etc).There is SO MUCH shopping here.  Nearly every store you can think of is here either in the Mall of Georgia, as a stand-alone big box store, or in one of the many strip malls that have popped up everywhere.  Fortunately for our finances, we haven't bought anything besides things to cook because we have no room to put any more stuff in our pretty small carry-on backpacks.  Being a vagabond and carrying your stuff with you everywhere you go is the limiting factor that will stop shopping--and spending--in its tracks.More more more!  This seems to be the siren call of American consumerism.  Have a house?  Why not get a bigger one?  The houses here are literally 5,000 square-feet plus which is an insane amount of space for mom, dad, and two point three kids.  Have two deck chairs?  Why not have six?  It seems to be an inborn need--having some stuff is good but having more is even better so we work and shop and work more to pay for the shopping then shop some more to make us happy after a hard day of work.  I am happy we are off the consumer treadmill.The bottom line: to each his own, of course.  This is a free country and people can do what makes them happy but I just hope that people actually think about what would make them happy instead of buying into a consumer lifestyle of excess that really isn't necessary."},
{"title": "How I Saved $1200 On My Taxes", "date": "Saturday, February 12, 2011", "text": "In the mad rush to get everything done during the week of our move, I also wanted to get our taxes completed so I wasn’t carrying our tax paperwork all over the country and could leave the papers in our storage shed. I first did our taxes manually which meant downloading the forms, breaking out my calculator, and using a pencil with a good eraser plus taking a couple hours out of my busy schedule. In the past I have usually had my taxes professionally done, especially during complicated years (buying or selling property, cashing out investments, complicated business years, etc). However that costs around $300 and I really didn’t want to spend my travel money on an accountant (not that accountants aren’t great but this past year wasn’t very complicated tax-wise).In other past years when the tax year was pretty uneventful, I would use prior year tax returns as a template and then enter my current info on a new tax form and do the calculations with a calculator. Needless to say, doing the math took quite a while because it seems like every calculation was made as convoluted as possible!So last week, I did our taxes using a previous year’s return as a template and was shocked to see that I would owe about $9,500. Ouch! Turns out I wasn’t following my income during the year very well and made much more than I thought and therefore owed much more in taxes than I thought, as well as other small things (like paying less in mortgage interest because we were getting down to about ten years owed on the house and that means more of our money at this point went to principal than interest. Property tax was also lower, and sometime around the beginning of the year, I found a much cheaper house insurance policy so all of these things meant I had less deductions than usual.While I was still reeling from the huge payment I would get to send to the IRS, I saw a post on a forum about people doing their taxes online. I did a bit of research, found this highly rated site, and learned that you can do your tax return online through a simple process of answering questions. At the end, you know how much you owe/will be receiving back, then you pay a small fee ($24.95 in my case), and you can either e-file or print and mail your return. I figured there was nothing to lose because at the end, if it showed that I owed as much as I had calculated, I would figure I was on the right track and not pay for or use the tax return I had just completed online.When I got finished, however, there were a few new deductions and credits that I was unaware of which meant that, according to this tax return, I would only owe $8,300! Still a lot, but less than my calculations had shown. So I happily paid for the return to be completed, downloaded the 1040 as well as the other attachments (schedule A, Schedule Cs, etc) and not only finished my taxes in record time (the whole process online took less than an hour and was super easy to complete), but was able to pack up all of my tax records for the year before we left the state.The bottom line is that if you usually do your own taxes and you aren’t super keen on every single new tax rule change, doing your taxes online can be a cost-effective, and in my case cost-enhancing was to take the drudgery out of tax filing!"},
{"title": "Update: The We Are Homeless Edition", "date": "Thursday, February 10, 2011", "text": "It's been a busy week.  Here's what happened:We finally got everything sold, stored, and packed for our trip.  The house closed (without a single hitch!) and we got the check from the proceeds of the sale which will pay off a debt and fund our travel for the next year.  We have an amazing realtor!We had a last minute scramble to clean out the house before the new owners arrived (I finished sweeping the entryway as they were driving up!).The cable company shut off our internet on the 6th instead of the 9th which meant no internet and no blog posts.We became officially homeless yesterday (scary!).I had a last minute medical situation which took up the better part of two days right as we were packing out our final things (more on this in a future post).I did our taxes in the middle of the fray because I didn't want to drag our tax paperwork all over the country with us and saved $1200! (more on this in a future post)We are heading to Atlanta tomorrow.  I picked Atlanta for the first month because usually the weather is much better there in February than dreary Seattle.  However Seattle is super sunny today and Atlanta has reports that they are expecting snow tomorrow :(I started some sort of hubbub with the state because I went to change the address on my driver's license to our mailing address (it is a law in Washington that you need to change your address within ten days of moving or you could get a fine).  They insisted on an actual location where I live and I insisted that I am technically homeless.  They said that the homeless don't drive.  I said they should check out all of the homeless living in their cars.  Anyway, they wouldn't help me so I took this problem to some very outspoken homeless advocates I know and they are now talking to legislators and making a very big deal about this--as they should.  While I have the option of buying another house, the actual homeless do not and they shouldn't get a fine just because they don't have an actual place to live.That's pretty much all that has happened over the past week.  As soon as we get situated my posting schedule will get back on track!"},
{"title": "10 Concrete Tips for Being a One Income Family", "date": "Wednesday, February 2, 2011", "text": "I came across this article about how to become a one income family. In the comments, many people asked for specific tips about living on one income. Since the hubby and I have been a one income family for exactly one month and two days, I can provide a few tips about how we got to this point:Before you cut back to being a one income family, you need to be out of debt. Leaving the sole wage-earner with the responsibility of rent/mortgage and regular living expenses plus tens of thousands of debt is simply not fair. So before cutting down to one income, if you have debt, both people need to work four jobs if necessary to pay off debt as quickly as possible.You need an emergency fund. Everyone needs an emergency fund but it is extra important if there is only one wage-earner in the family. What if the wage-earner gets injured and can't work? What if the family is socked with a huge one-time expense? Besides these problems, should the family decide that the second adult needs to go back to work because finances aren't working out as expected, at least with an emergency fund, the family will have a little cushion while the non wage-earner gets back into the world of work.You will need to stop spending money. Since we have become a one-income family, my spending has come to a screeching halt. I have money that I could spend but now when I go to the store or when I feel too lazy to cook, I really ask myself if my limited amount of money should go to that fast food burger, that pair of shoes, or that cute gift for a friend. Usually the answer is no.You need to look at all of your expenses and see how they can be lowered/eliminated based on your new lifestyle. We have been able to cut back on our cell phone contract (since I'm not working I don't use my cell phone nearly as much as I used to). A couple of months ago we cut our cable bill in half since we knew that soon our income would be reduced. We got rid of our second car quite a while ago and I am happy to ride the bus/carpool with the hubby if I am going somewhere--this simple move alone has saved us many thousands of dollars.For expenses that are not set, such as costs for food and clothing, you can really make some big cuts. Since becoming a one income family I have forced myself to shop at the Goodwill (and loved it, surprisingly), cooked at home nearly every day (to where eating out is a treat and not a daily occurrence), and cut way back on Starbucks (when I was working it was a daily habit; I have been able to kick this habit since it isn't part of my \"work day\" any more).Things I used to spend money on have been replaced by creativity. I simply don't have lots of money to throw around any more. The money we do have is pretty limited so I can't justify spending on many things like I used to and I can't reasonably spend money and expect to \"make it up\" with my next paycheck since I am no longer receiving any paychecks. This has resulted in me baking treats for parties instead of running to the store and buying them. I have declined a couple of invites to expensive restaurants with friends and with other friends I have had to suggest much cheaper options for going out.I have re-read the Tightwad Gazette. I was a fan of this book about how a large family survived on one income some years ago when it first came out and I recently reread it in order to get some ideas for ways to further reduce spending and save money. With the internet, there is no end to the information you can find on the topic. It is much better to learn from others than to learn from your own mistakes.Entertainment is now free. We haven't been to a movie theater in ages. We don't go out dancing every weekend anymore. When your income is reduced, you need to change your entertainment options to correlate with your income. Fortunately there are lots of free and cheap things to do to keep yourself entertained (see previous posts on this topic).We are changing our entire lifestyle to accommodate this change and to get more in line with our income. Big house? Gone. While we will be traveling for a while, should we decide to become stationary again we will definitely end up with a smaller home which is cheaper to buy, furnish, heat, air condition, decorate, etc. Our traveling will also be done as cheaply as possible (staying with friends and family instead of at hotels, being flexible with our flights to get the best rates, etc.).And some things that don't apply to us...hubby is retired and we live on his retirement income so there are some things that are different for us than for a young family with kids. Remembering back to when we were a young family with kids, if we had been a one-income family, I would have: made his life as easy as possible if he was the wage earner (ie: clean the house so we wouldn't need a housekeeper, make his lunch so he didn't need to eat out, etc). Cook as much as possible from scratch (this is healthier too). Use more creativity than money on the kid's birthday parties. You get the idea...The bottom line is that a family simply can't live on one income of $40,000 like they did when the family had two incomes that totalled $80,000. Something (or many somethings) need to change in order to ratchet the cost of living down to half of what it used to be. That doesn't mean that your life will only be half as fun, you can only eat half as much, or you will be destined to be destitute. Plenty of families are actually thriving with less of everything (less money, less stuff, less Starbucks) but it takes both a shift in spending and a shift in attitude to accomplish this."},
{"title": "Update: The We're Nearly Homeless Edition", "date": "Tuesday, February 1, 2011", "text": "With five days to go before the big move (actually the big leave because we aren't actually moving anywhere since we will be traveling), here's what we've been up to:After three garage sales, we were able to get rid of most of our stuff.  On Sunday I called some friends and family over to the house and said \"help yourself, it's all free\".  The stuff included everything that was left over from the garage sales, the food in our cabinets, knick nacks, and everything else except for things that we are keeping which were put aside in another room.  Everyone had a funny reaction to this.  First everyone kind of stood around looking at stuff, unsure if they should actually go start picking up things they wanted.  With some encouragement, people started picking up a few things, often asking if someone else wanted something they were looking at.  After a while it turned into a free for all and with amazing speed, pretty much everything was snapped up.  The things that were left over will be taken to a local thrift store.  It was great to see people hauling stuff away because I know they will enjoy the items.  It also made me realize that giving really is better than hoarding because the stuff will be in use instead of gathering dust in a closet. (My sister did say that it felt weird because people don't just open their house up and say \"please take everything in here\")It was hard to have such a little bit of food left after the big give-away.  We emptied out all of our cabinets and pantry which included nearly all of our food.  Almost all of the food was snapped up quickly as well (even the salt and pepper shakers went!).  It is great that the food will go to people who will eat it (again, as opposed to gathering dust in the back of the pantry) but it was a bit disconcerting to see that we have literally only a day's worth of food left.  For my entire adult life, having a fully stocked pantry made me feel secure and now, the opposite, having no food on hand, is making me feel insecure.  So today I went to the store and picked up a bag of healthy food that we will eat before we leave (cheese, baby carrots to nibble on, a couple of apples, etc).We're still discussing our future.  Hubby was a little freaked out about just heading off overseas next week so we decided to spend a month in Atlanta, a month in Connecticut, then a couple of months in Asia.  Our thinking is that this will kind of ease us into travel mode (besides, Tokyo in April is way better than Tokyo in February!).  We bought our plane tickets, and next week we will be on our way to the East Coast (which based on the weather report today makes me...um...worried.  It is a beautiful sunny day in the Pacific Northwest today and we will be heading into the so-called 'storm of the century'.) Yikes.We are storing some of the basics (bed, couple of TVs, personal papers and pictures, and other things we don't want to part with such as my favorite cast iron pan and a couple of antiques) at a local storage unit until we decide whether we even like the continuous travel lifestyle.  Everything we own will fit in the smallest unit--a 5'x10'--but we were pleasantly surprised that when we went to rent the unit today, they gave us the next bigger size--5'x15'--for the same price as the smallest size because they didn't have any of the smaller units available.  They also gave us one month free.  Kaching!Our final plans are still a work in progress.  Hubby very much likes to be rooted in one place but I really feel like we need to get out and explore the world so we will travel for six months and then re-evaluate.  We may end up renting a small apartment as our home base or buying a much smaller house as our home base (as opposed to the very generous offer by my sister in law to \"home base\" from her house at very, very little cost) and then travel more often but not continuously.  I guess we will figure it out when the time comes.We're busy.  For the past couple of months we have been \"getting ready\" to leave but it was kind of a slow process.  Now that we are getting down to the wire, our \"to do\" lists are growing exponentially!Overall it is kind of a surreal experience.  I have owned a house since I was 19 years old and to not have a house is just odd.  I don't think it will totally sink in until after we move out.  It's a little scary.Everyone we have told about our adventure has been super supportive.  Word travels fast and we were even stopped in the parking lot at Walmart today by a lady we know who had heard from another friend about our plans.  The overwhelming consensus is \"I wish I can do/could have done something like that, it will be a great adventure.\"  At least by us doing this, we won't have to wonder about what we \"could have done\".  Come to think of it, there hasn't been a single naysayer that I have heard of. No one saying it is a crazy idea.  No one saying we will fail and literally end up homeless.  I guess that is something.  I hope they are right."},

Our final garage sale will be tomorrow and after that we will be ready to move out.  Here's how we have been able to get rid of nearly everything we own:CraigsList is awesome! We used postings on CraigsList to get rid of most of the \"big stuff\" like furniture, appliances, and most other things of value. Best of all, the ads are free and there is no limit to the number of ads you can post.Garage sales. Tomorrow will be our third garage sale in three weeks. We have had a really good turn out of people even though it is mid winter. Again, a posting on CraigsList and a few signs posted around the neighborhood as well as a notice sent out to my FaceBook friends has brought in lots of people to buy our stuff.Hubby has been pretty creative with making sales to his friends. He knows quite a few people at our local casino so he packed up his van with lots of stuff he wanted to sell (clothes, etc) and basically tells everyone he has stuff to sell and they come out to the van to take a look (see picture above) and to buy!Giving stuff away. After our final garage sale tomorrow, we will invite friends and family to come over and take anything they want at no charge. I have also put stuff aside for people who I know want certain things and will distribute these bags next week. Donating stuff. The final thing we will do before we move out will be to box up any leftovers and donate the items to our local thrift store.  I will donate any leftover food to a meal program that feeds the homeless, and we will also bring some things (leftover paper towels, toiletries, some food stuff) with us to the cousins house we will be staying at for a few days.And \"wa la\" everything is gone!"},

The list included 43 things I wanted to complete during my 43rd year of life. I have been so busy lately that I kind of put these goals on the back burner but today everything worked out and I got to complete one of my goals!I had to run to the east side today and decided to browse the website of one of the universities in Seattle (Bastyr, my favorite) and saw that they had a public lecture today so I went. I love this university. It's focus is on naturapathic health, the campus is beautiful and relaxing, the students are wonderful to listen to, and they tend to have a lot of classes and events that the general public can attend. Today I learned about nutrition and it was really interesting. Best of all, it was free. So here's yet another way to enjoy free entertainment in your city--just check the websites of local universities and see what's scheduled. It's a great way to get some free, educational entertainment.p.s. Tom Ballard, ND was the guest speaker. He was talking about his latest book, Nutrition 1, 2, 3. Here's his blog.p.s.s. After the lecture I went around to the back of the school, took off my shoes and sox, and walked the rock path (see picture above). It hurts your feet but it's supposed to be great for your health.

{"title": "Super Cheap Meals", "date": "Tuesday, January 25, 2011", "text": "With about a week and a half before we move out, we have been working diligently on \"eating down\" our food supply so we can both save some money and limit the amount of stuff we have to give away before we move.  Needless to say, the meals are getting a bit boring but I have also noticed that eating this kind of simple, cheap food, we can basically eat for less than a dollar per meal. Here's what we have been eating lately:Breakfast:--two eggs (hard boiled or fried), two pieces of toast, an apple or banana  (about 70 cents total!)--breakfast burrito (tortilla, refried beans, scrambled egg, tomato, onion) (about 60 cents total!)--2 pancakes, 2 eggs (about 40 cents total!)--oatmeal with milk and cinnamon, apple or banana (about 70 cents total!)Lunch:--tuna sandwich, carrot sticks, oatmeal cookies  (about $1)--grilled cheese sandwich, tomato soup, pear  (about $1)--homemade vegetable soup, salad (about $1)--homemade chili, rice, raw vegies (about $1)Dinner:--salmon, cous cous, salad--baked chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy, frozen vegies--sweet and sour meatballs, rice, tomato and cucumber salad--spaghetti, salad, garlic breadMost of the stuff we have been eating is from the freezer and pantry augmented with fresh eggs, fruit, and vegetables.  This has been a great way to save money since we aren't running to the grocery store and making a haul each week and we have been able to eat quite a few things that had been previously pushed to the back of the pantry.p.s.

{"title": "Bummer Day", "date": "Monday, January 24, 2011", "text": "I am generally about 98% positive but some days I wish I had just stayed in bed.  It hasn't been a very good day and a half:We had a shooting at a Walmart a few towns over yesterday.  Two deputies were shot, fortunately they weren't killed.  A deputy shot and killed the man who had started the whole incident, and a 13 year old girl who was with the guy was killed in the cross fire.  This was a pretty rural Walmart where people never think about having to dodge bullets.  I guess these things can happen anywhere.  Sad.Jack LaLanne died yesterday which is also sad.  I am happy that he had a long, healthy, happy life but it seems like the end of an era with his passing.(TMI) I had an appointment for a pelvic exam this morning and apparently I didn't pay attention when I was making the appointment because I have my period today so I had to cancel my appointment at the last minute.  I'm sure my doctor isn't happy.I did my taxes today and was stunned to find out that I owe about double what I expected to owe for my 2010 taxes.  Even with hubby not working last year, somehow I earned a lot more money last year than I thought I had.  It didn't help that my deductions went way down too (since we refinanced our house to a 15 year term a few years ago and a low 4.3% interest rate, we simply don't have the big mortgage interest rate deduction that we used to).  Bummer.Our house is so empty and depressing.  I am still happy that we are leaving it's just that looking at the few remnants of our life that are left, it kind of feels like we have sold off many of our memories.I'm still stressing over where we will go first after our house closes.  It will either be Japan, Philippines, Connecticut, Atlanta in the first few months or Atlanta, Connecticut, Japan, Philippines.  The only stressful parts are our free flights with the military to Asia.  With no guarantee that we will get on any particular flight, it makes it hard to buy tickets to the other locations and I really don't want to be stranded in Japan waiting for flights because it is super expensive there.My computer is acting up and I want to throw it out the window.  It keeps freezing up.  I think it is something with the IE browser but even changing it to Firefox doesn't help.  So I have had to do the system restore thing...about three times.  Ugh.  But I don't want to buy a new computer now because I am waiting for the Sandy Bridge processor from Intel but have no idea when it will be out.  And I don't know if I should buy a new computer because I have a boatload of taxes to pay...I log into FaceBook and see one friend who said she is having a lousy birthday, a niece who said it has been the worst day ever, and news from another niece that her baby is at the ER with a severe headache. AyayayI'll quit whining now and hope that the planets align better tomorrow..."},
{"title": "Want to Achieve Your Goals?  Write Them Down", "date": "Sunday, January 23, 2011", "text": "As part of clearing out nearly everything we own from our house before the sale is final and we head out to travel the world, I came across several boxes of papers that I had stored away over the years. Since I am a paper aficionado--I can't pass up cute stationary or notebooks--and since I have had a habit of writing down \"to do\" lists and goals since way before GTD was popular in productivity circles, you can imagine how much paper I had to wade through.Fortunately most of the paper is now filling up the recycle bin instead of being dragged along with us but the most interesting thing I noticed about many of the pages of notes and goals I had written was that most of what I wrote has actually come true!There were pages of notes on how I would start a business and even a note from my mother with a clipping from a letter to the editor of New Woman magazine that I had written years ago about being inspired to start a business because of a contest they had run (I didn't win the contest). Everything I had written in the contest entry about the business I wanted to start actually happened. The odd part was after I entered the contest I tossed the application in a file and never looked at it again until more than a decade later yet my business turned out almost exactly like I had imagined it.Then there were notebooks filled with my dreams of selling everything and traveling the world. Of course at the time there was no freaking way that would be possible. On my \"to do\" lists for this goal, which I had written maybe five to six years ago, was pay off debts--followed by a very LONG list of creditors and debts--and convince hubby to go with me. Also listed was \"quit job\", \"have the biggest garage sale our neighborhood has ever seen\", and \"sell house for a profit to fund our travel.\" At the time I wrote this it seemed like an amazing dream, something I really wanted to do but never really thought would happen because of a thousand other things that were standing in my way including a great business that would be hard to leave, a hubby that likes stability, more debts than most people ever have to deal with, and just the overall difficulty that anyone would have with totally changing their life.Until now. When I read those pages I nearly fell out of my chair! Again, almost everything that I had imagined and written down has come true. By hammering away at our debts we were able to pay them off. The universe brought me the difficulty of a sudden end-point to my business that I now think was a blessing in disguise. With my lack of income and the current economy hubby started listening to my idea to sell everything and travel which will actually save us money when compared to the amount of money we need for our current lifestyle (big house payments, the yard guy since hubby hates yard work, increasing taxes and utilities, etc). There were other goals that I wrote down that have come true as well.I don't think all of this was coincidence. I think that by writing down my goals, it somehow gets the universe into alignment (and/or makes me more aware of certain things that correlate to what I want) which actually moves me towards achieving my goals. For example, I wrote down \"get out of debt\". Now anyone can write down such a thing but by focusing my attention on getting out of debt, Dave Ramsey was brought to my attention. By following Dave Ramsey's plan, I was able to get out of debt. I think if this wouldn't have been one of my goals and I had just given up and decided that I would always be in debt, I would have been less likely to pay attention when I heard about Dave Ramsey. I wouldn't have tuned into his show each night on Fox Business and listened to him hammering away on the travesties of debt for hours and hours each week, and then I wouldn't have followed his plan.The moral of this story is WRITE DOWN YOUR GOALS! Even if it is something small, like \"get a tattoo\", write it down. If there is something you have always wanted no matter how far-fetched, no matter how crazy, no matter how impossible, write it down. Meditate on it. Envision it. Write down a step-by-step plan on how to reach your goal (even if that plan sounds crazy as well), then take action!Everything may not go exactly as you hope (when I wrote down \"quit job\" I certainly didn't envision the office I work for totally imploding, a federal investigation, and an overthrow of the Board!). Everything may not happen quickly (when I wrote those goals down I wanted them to happen IMMEDIATELY...it actually took years). And, your goals may change. You may find that your youthful desire to jump out of an airplane with a package of nylon strapped to your back gives way to, um, the realization that you hate heights and you hate being terrified.No matter. With a list of written goals, you will be well on your way to achieving them."},
{"title": "Liquidating Our Life", "date": "Saturday, January 22, 2011", "text": "With a week and a half to go before we move out and our second of three garage sales wrapped up today, almost everything we own has been liquidated. It's kind of sad, seeing things we have had for decades being sold for pennies. Also, it's kind of telling that Americans spend so much of their money on crap that has very little actual value (and worse, like me, many buy this stuff of little actual value on credit so technically they are working for months and months to pay off stuff that loses about 90% of it's value as soon as you take it out of the store!).On a happy note, I am really glad I don't have to pack up and move all of this stuff! My years of hauling boxes and furniture are over! On an even better note, I just realized that when we pay off the house and hubby's credit card we will have a higher net worth than we have ever had in our life! I would often drive by homeless people when I was buried under credit card and tax debt and think, that guy may have nothing but he has a higher net worth than I did since my net worth was in the minus six figures. I expect the relief from paying off these final debts will be quite liberating.So far, even though we are still living in our house, being nearly house-less has the following advantages:No bills! We will have a few final bills for our house but when we leave we will have a total of one bill, for our cell phones.No shopping! Since all we are taking with us is what we can carry in our backpacks, we can't shop which saves a ton of money.We actually have money! When you don't shop and you are super busy getting ready to move, selling stuff like a maniac on CraigsList, and packing up the few things you will keep in storage, you don't spend money, and it just keeps adding up. This is something that has actually never happened to me before because I used to spend every dime I had, and then some, because my daily \"entertainment\" was shopping. These days it always surprises me that when I check my bank accounts, not only is there money in there but there is more money in the accounts than I had the last time I checked. Amazing how that works! Packing up our meager belongings, we realize how much stuff we actually NEED to survive. And it isn't that much. Some clothes, some toiletries, a laptop, a cell phones. That's it. Sometimes I think I just woke up from a dream. In my dream I am working furiously to acquire all of these consumer things that I thought I MUST HAVE in order to have a happy life but I wake up and after the fog has cleared, I realize that all that I need I already have (and it all fits in one backpack). Wow.And when I start to freak out about this whole 'sell everything and travel the world with only what you can carry' thing, I look back on a bunch of Betsy's blog posts (her and her husband did a similar thing last year) here (mostly the posts from August and September 2010 before they left). Apparently a bit of panic before you chuck everything you have ever known and head out into the unknown is quite common..."},

She is going to ask her attorney about this as we think she will get part of these pensions and that it will be spelled out in the final settlement decree.Change her online passwords (her ex-husband knows some of her passwords)Get her own safe deposit box since she used to use her husband's boxApply for her own credit cards.  Even though I am pretty anti-credit card she wants her own cards as she has always been an authorized user on her husband's cardsRe-key the locks in her home (her ex still has keys to the house)Update information at her kid's schools (dad's new address, etc)Get her own cell plan (her husband has been paying for her cell on his plan)Separate her other accounts (airline mile accounts, Costco membership, etc)That's all we could think of.

{"title": "The Big Garage Sale", "date": "Saturday, January 15, 2011", "text": "We are in the home stretch of clearing out our house before we move.  With only a couple of weeks to go, we still have a ton of stuff to get rid of so we decided to have a garage sale today.  We've never had a garage sale in the dead of winter since most people equate going to garage sales with spreading your stuff out across your drive way on a sunny day but with no time to spare we decided to give it a shot anyway.  Here's what happened:We usually have our garage sales run from 7am to 3pm.  It's a good thing we decided to start at 8am this morning because at 7am it was still pitch dark outside, something we hadn't even considered! The only advertisement we did for the sale was on CraigsList and that one small, free, advertisement brought in a whole lot of people.There was a swarm of \"professional\" garage salers who showed up bright and early and seem to know each other by name.  While they were looking at our stuff I overheard them talking about other sales they were going to and about their resale businesses.One guy told me that he used to sell boat parts as a full time business but since the economy tanked, he decided to resell household items which is a good business to be in during a down market.It's a bit sad to see all of our stuff which we spent our hard-earned money on be sold for pennies on the dollar.  That's a lesson for my shopping future as now when I buy something, I also consider what I can resell it for (usually about 10% of retail).We did sell quite a bit of stuff (earning about $1,500.00 but that included a couple of big items).  But we still need to have a sale next Saturday and probably the Saturday after that (we told each customer that came today to come back next Saturday to check out the stuff we didn't have room to put out today).We find that one-day garage sales work best.  If we have a Saturday and Sunday sale, Sunday is usually pretty dead (not many customers) and we are usually tired from all of the work on Saturday.It was a bit difficult inviting friends to our sale. They wanted a super low price on stuff and we felt like we had to give them the price they asked for but if we would have sold some of these things to strangers we would have got a little higher price (ie: yes we want to get rid of everything but we still want to make money on it otherwise we would have just carted it to the thrift store!).We also live in a very multi-cultural area and you can tell the people who are from countries where bargaining over every little thing is the rule instead of the exception.  They drive pretty hard bargains.  I let hubby deal with them.It is much better to do these sales in the summer because it is SO COLD in our garage (where we held the sale).Unlike past garage sales where we either spent the money we earned from the sale by running to the mall right after we closed up shop or spent the money on paying off a bill (final debts will be paid when our house closes) we decided to put the proceeds from our sale into our emergency fund and not spend any of it.Overall, when you need to liquidate your stuff quickly, having a garage sale (as well as selling stuff on CraigsList) is the fastest way to make it happen."},

{"title": "A Quick Update...in 20 Sentences", "date": "Thursday, January 13, 2011", "text": "Another update...here goes...Just got a call from our realtor, our house is closing two weeks early which means around February 1st.  I need to get busy selling everything!I suck at New Years Resolutions.  The only things I wanted to do were exercise daily and avoid Starbucks.  I failed at both by day 10.  :(I have been officially unemployed for 13 days and I am bored silly.  I'm already trolling for a new business to start.We will get to Asia sooner than expected.  We hope to be in Japan the first week of February.February 1st will be the first month I don't have a big paycheck coming in.  I am getting a bit worried since I have been earning a paycheck non-stop for nearly 30 years.  Eekk.I like updating my Tumblr blog because it is so easy and I don't have to actually write bog posts.  Pictures and links suffice.I'm getting bored with our food.  We are trying to eat everything in the pantry and not eat out at all/buy more food.  Blah.I am a huge fan of Reddit and AskMetaFilter and have been spending way too much time on both sites.Now that we are getting closer to being houseless (homeless?) hubby and I are both in an Oh-My-God-What-Are-We-Doing panic.We had snow yesterday but it all melted by today (unlike the family in New England that are still wading through more than a foot of snow.  Even family in Atlanta got more snow than we did!).I will miss my friends when I am gone.  It was nice getting together with a couple of friends today who are both amazing people.I need to force myself to exercise everyday.  The way I have decided to do this is to ride my bike from Canada to Mexico in June.  I figure that will be 30 straight days of six to eight hours of exercise every day.  Perfect.  Hubby doesn't know yet.My favorite ice cream is now Umpqua Espresso Madness.  I'd never heard of the brand before but hubby brought some home and it was amazing.We got a bill for our house insurance and it increased by 105%.  Just because I called about making a claim.  We didn't even make a claim and the company didn't even pay any money out but still the price shot up.  I don't really care because we are moving but thought I would warn others about such a thing because it was a total surprise to me.I want a Mac Book Pro.  I don't need one but I want one.  I don't even know if I really want one but every person I see with one looks so happy when they are using it.  Oh the power of suggestion.The shooting in Arizona was totally sad.  It wasn't a gun control issue, it was a \"we have a really lousy mental illness safety net system\" issue.I need to eat healthier or I'm going to die.  Seriously.  I eat well for a few days then fall into my eat something quick no matter how unhealthy it is habit.As soon as we get the check from our house sale, we will pay off the mortgage and hubby's credit card and be completely debt free.  I. Can't. Wait.I am proof reading the book that I wrote during the summer.  I hope to shop it to a publisher in the spring.I appreciate all of the comments on this blog.  It is nice to know there are people out there that think like me!"},
{"title": "10 Things I Like to Splurge On", "date": "Tuesday, January 11, 2011", "text": "While I am usually pretty careful with how I spend my money, I occasionally like to splurge.  Here are ten things I don't mind paying more for:Real maple syrup.Purses (Coach and LeSportsac mostly)Notebooks (I have a paper fetish and love beautiful notepads and notebooks)Baskin Robbins Blast (more expensive than a comparable Starbucks drink but sooo tasty!)Higher end candy (especially quality dark chocolate and imported black licorice)Quality shoes (Born, Keen, Ryka, etc)Pilot ink pens (the only kind of pens I use)High quality sheets and comforters (I'm super picky about this and require 600 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets along with a down comforter with cotton comforter cover...no polyester!)Travel (we tend to be bargain basement travelers but travel more often than most people)Occasional experiences with other people (it makes more sense to take all of the kids on a cruise than give gifts they won't use/will get rid of soon, I would rather treat friends to lunch and the museum than give them a gift card...I like to give memories!)Well that's my list of splurges.  These are the things that mean the most to me.  What do you splurge on?"},
{"title": "How We're Staying Warm This Winter", "date": "Monday, January 10, 2011", "text": "It's been a pretty cold winter around here. Tonight the temps are supposed to be in the low 20s and tomorrow we may end up with five inches of snow or more. Brrrrr. Here's how we have been staying warm this winter AND saving money at the same time:We have an adjustable/automatic thermostat which we set at 55 degrees from 10pm to 7am (the time we are sleeping) and 65 degrees from 7am to 10pm.When we do leave the house during the day, we always remember to set the heat back to 60 degrees. No use keeping the house toasty warm when no one is home to enjoy it! (note: we have a note on the door that says 'TURN DOWN HEAT' so we won't forget to do this). We wear sweaters or sweatshirts when we are home (otherwise I would want the heat set to 70 because I am usually cold all winter). I wear heavy socks as well.I don't mind having the heat set so low at night because we have a couple extra blankets on the bed which keep us snugly warm.When we are home we usually hibernate in our bedroom. Our bedroom is fairly big so besides the bed we have a sofa as well as a TV and our computer tables in there so it is kind of like a living room anyway. The benefit to this is that we can (again) set the heat back to 60 or even 55 and use a small, $7 space heater from Walmart which heats the room up almost instantly. It's better, and cheaper, than heating the whole house when we aren't even using the rest of the house.We are often out during the day. This allows us to set the heat down to 60 degrees (I hate coming home to a freezing cold house which takes an hour to warm up so 60 is a good compromise temperature). We then enjoy \"free\" heat at whatever place we happen to be at.When we are home we generally hang out in the kitchen. During this time we are usually cooking a meal such as lunch or dinner and at the same time I like to use the oven to bake which also helps heat up the kitchen.And some more things about keeping warm:Choose your house carefully. Our house is a big tri-level and it didn't dawn on me when we were buying the house that this design lets all of the heat immediately head up to the ceiling thus the lower areas of the house always seem cold and the heat tends to run continuously because the temperature control is on the mid level so it never senses that it is warm enough to shut off.I remember that when I lived in an apartment during college that I hardly ever had to turn on the heat as the heat that came from all of the units below and next to me seemed to keep my apartment warm.Be sure you insulate and weatherstrip! Our first house was nearly 100 years old and you could practically watch the heat head straight up the stairs and out the roof because it had literally NO insulation. Eventually we added insulation in the attic, walls, and between the floor joists which, along with installing new insulated windows made a huge difference in our heat/energy consumption.A small house is cheaper to heat!My friend has a small house with a wood stove in the middle of his home as well as a nice wood lot out back and heats his home for free each winter. Of course he has to go chop down and dry the wood himself, but his wood stove keeps the entire house cozy warm all winter.Never use combustion appliances to heat your home! Things like barbecue grills and other appliances that give off heat yet are designed to be used OUTSIDE should never be used inside because you can die from carbon monoxide poisoning.If you can't pay your heating bill, call 211 and see if there are any local agencies that can pay this bill for you. A community service agency in our area coordinates a program which pays one utility bill per year for families in need which can really come in handy during the dead of winter.If you have no heat in your home at all (ie: the gas has been shut off, etc) consider going to a warming shelter when it is bitterly cold. Our city opens shelters for the homeless and anyone else who doesn't have/can't afford heat in their home. People can stay over night and even get a free meal at these places (call 211 for shelters in your area).Stay safe and keep warm!FYI...Here's another contest entitled \"The Dangers of Being in Debt\"  Click here for details."},

{"title": "10 Ways to Spend Absolutely No Money", "date": "Sunday, January 9, 2011", "text": "I have been unemployed for a little over a week so far and my main emphasis has been to hold on to my money as long as possible which basically means spending nothing at all if I can help it. Here are ten things I have done to do just that:Stay home. Inevitably if I go out--shopping, mall walking, to visit friends--I end up spending money. On the days that I stay home I don't spend any money. Simple!Kill your habits. My habit is (was) a daily Starbucks Green Tea Frapuccino. Since the first of the year I have not bought a single frapuccino and I figure I have saved around $40 so far. Obviously if my habit was smoking or drinking I would have saved considerably more money by not indulging these habits.Hang out in free places. My usual MO was to go to a coffee shop nearly every day either to meet friends or break out the netbook and get some work done. I know from #2 above, that if I go into a coffee shop, I'm going to buy something which I don't want to do. So now in the mornings I go with hubby to the local casino where he plays his morning poker game, I set up my netbook in their coffee shop, and enjoy the free beverages they offer (coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and pop is offered self-serve for free there). The library is another good option. Appreciate what you have. I have been drooling over a new MacBook Pro, however my laptop and netbook work fine. Ditto with clothes, shoes, jewelry, etc. Whenever I think I want to go out and buy something new I remind myself that I have plenty of things that, while not new, are just perfect for me so I don't need to go out and buy anything new.Make substitutions. I had a giant bag of oats and wanted to make a big pan of granola cereal for breakfast however I was out of maple syrup which I always use in my granola recipe. When we went to the store hubby saw that syrup cost $8 for a small bottle and said \"geez that's a lot, why don't you just use the jar of honey we have at home to make granola.\" Duh, what a good idea! So I did use the honey and the cereal came out great!Eat at home. One of the simplest temptations for many people is to go out to eat. There are so many restaurants, the food seems to taste \"better\" there, it is quicker, you may be out of ingredients you need to cook at home, etc. Eating at home, however, will cost you zero dollars, and when you are trying to save every penny, this is an obvious option. We are also trying to \"eat down\" our stock of food before we move so eating at home is even more of a necessity. We have come up with some pretty interesting recipes trying to mix and match all of the food that has been stuffed in the back of the cupboards for years and turn it into edible meals.Enjoy freebies. I am always on the look out for freebies. This week I have enjoyed food samples at Costco for free, had a free sample of red velvet cake at another store, learned how to put ads on my Tumblr page just by Googling, got a free pen from a friend's office, and had a free dinner compliments of another friend. I like free stuff!Do your own work instead of paying others to do it. When out house inspection came back with a few things that needed to be done prior to the appraisal including cleaning the gutters and replacing some plastic in the crawl space, we decided to do these jobs ourselves instead of hiring others to do it for us. Money spent on these jobs: $0 (we happened to have a roll of 6 mil plastic in the garden shed).Utilize free services. I could have put a (paid for) ad in our local newspaper to sell some of the stuff in our house that we need to get rid of before we move but I decided to put free ads on CraigsList instead. There was also a free vaccination clinic at our local health department recently that, should I have needed vaccines, would have been happy to participate in and get a valuable service for free.Make it yourself. When I was mall walking, I was tempted by the cookie store, Cinnabon, and a place that makes great smoothies. Instead of spending money, I went home and made cookies and a smoothie at home. I'm considering making cinnamon rolls at home today. I have also made handbags, quilts, and a garden shed at home instead of buying these things already made.We live in one of the richest countries on the planet and Americans typically have more \"stuff\" than just about anyone else on the planet so there are more than enough ways to get by with spending very little, if any, money on many of the things we want."},
{"title": "I May Never Shop Retail Again!", "date": "Saturday, January 8, 2011", "text": "I started out with the idea of going to the Goodwill, putting an outfit together, then writing a blog post about it. I should also tell you I wasn't very thrilled about the idea because while I have shopped at thrift stores a couple of times, usually for books and plant stands, I have never bought clothes there before. I would look at the racks and racks of used clothes and think \"ick\". Maybe it was because the only clothes I had to wear as a kid was hand-me-downs or maybe it is just the thought of wearing clothes that a stranger had worn, either way, the though of buying clothes to actually wear from a thrift shop kind of gave me the heebie jeebies. Can you tell I'm a clothes snob?So anyway, yesterday I forced myself to go to the Goodwill. I know a girl who worked there so I was going to say \"hi\" to her and have her model an outfit, get the details, take a picture, and leave. It didn't quite work out that way.I went into the store and headed for the clothing racks. I found a couple of cute shirts which pulled me in even more. Two and a half hours later, hubby called to see if I was at the mall and I told him no, I had been shopping at the Goodwill for the last two plus hours. You could have heard a pin drop. He knows I'm a clothes snob so the thought of me shopping at a thrift store was as foreign an idea to him as it was initially to me.I found literally hundreds of pieces of clothing that I instantly loved! And they were sooo cheap!! I ended up leaving with the clothes you see in the picture above--a total of ten pieces of clothes including a pair of jeans, a jacket, a dress, and seven shirts, for a grand total of $34.10! You would have thought I hit the lottery or something I was so happy when I was shopping. Other people noticed my glee at finding Ann Taylor pants, Hollister shirts, Jones New York blouses, etc. and most commented on it. One lady said that shopping there was addicting. Another lady told me to come back Monday when all of the pink and red tagged clothes would be half off. Another lady smiled knowingly.So now I am an official fan of the Goodwill! I don't think I will ever buy retail clothes again. Here's what I love about buying clothes at a thrift store:You don't have to worry about if the clothes will shrink when you get them home and wash them as they have already been washed and have shrunk all they will shrink.You don't have to wonder if the color will fade, because again, they have been washed multiple times.I like how the clothes are arranged by color. For each type of clothing (t shirts, jeans, skirts, etc) they are arranged by color instead of by designer or style like they do in department stores. This makes it much easier to skip over the colors I don't wear. The prices can't be beat! Like-new Ann Taylor Loft pants for $12.95!!! Hollister t shirts for $1.95! A $60 Columbia jacket for $15!!  Holy Cow!I never wear new new clothes anyway. I always buy clothes then wash them a couple of times to get the manufacturing 'chemically' smell out of them before I wear them.Being unemployed and having, yikes, zero income coming in now, I need to stretch my dollars. I still want to look good however so this is an excellent way to do both.I thought shopping at a thrift store would be depressing because only poor, desperate people would be shopping there but I was wrong.  The parking lot was full of mini vans and SUVs and the random Mercedes.  The people inside the store looked like they came from all walks of life as well, from the poor, to the elderly, to teenagers who were dressed really stylishly, to business women on their lunch break who looked like they bought their clothes at Macy's (but now I know their secret!)If you are like me and kind of squeamish at the thought of shopping at thrift stores, you definitely should give it a try.  I went to the Goodwill in an upscale neighborhood simply because the one downtown always looks so dark and depressing when I drive by and at the time I was already depressed enough about the thought of shopping there.  Now I am so psyched I'm going to go to ALL of the thrift stores I can find just to see what kind of treasures they hold."},

{"title": "Exercising...For Free", "date": "Monday, January 3, 2011", "text": "Today was day three of my resolution to exercise at least two hours every day.  I mean, I am not working and have nothing else to do so I have absolutely no excuse not to make time in my un-busy schedule to do this.  Here's how my exercise program has been working out so far:Day 1--walked three miles on our old treadmill which we have owned for ages.  I then followed along with an hour long yoga class that is offered on TV through our cable company which was also free.  Hubby gave me an hour long deep tissue massage on this day too which was awesome (and free!).  I also did 20 push ups and 20 sit ups (free...just need floor space) and 5x10 reps with 3 pound hand weights which I have had for ages (also free but if I didn't own these I probably would have used heavy cans of food from the pantry).Day 2--felt HIDEOUS.  I think it was from overexercising my way-out-of-shape body plus the screeching halt to sugar, wheat, other grains, chocolate, Frapuccinos, and other unhealthy food as of December 31st.  With all of the exercise and the massage I think all of the toxins in my body were screaming and running for cover causing me to feel like I had been run over by a truck.  Ick.  I couldn't, however, give up my goal on the second day, that would be really wimpy, so I took an aspirin...or five...and exercised anyway.  I walked three miles on the treadmill, 5x10 hand weights, 20 push ups, 20 sit ups, and followed along with another exercise show on TV, this time it was dancing.  I'm so out of shape it is pitiful and I am so disappointed with myself because I let myself get this way.  Remembering way (WAY!) back, I used to be able to work out for three or four hours at a time sometimes twice a day and could control every muscle in my body, now my muscles are screaming for mercy because they probably haven't been used for...oh...30 years.  Yikes.Day 3--felt better but my muscles are still telling me that I am totally out of shape.  I walked three miles this morning at the mall (I love mall walking!) which was free.  In the afternoon I came home and did 20 push ups, 20 sit ups, 5x10 hand weights, and then followed along with two 30-minute kickboxing exercise shows.  Hubby watched for a while laughing hilariously so you can count this as free entertainment for the family as well!To date, all of my exercising has been free.  Even if you don't have cable TV that offers free follow along exercise classes, you can always get free exercise DVDs from the library or find them online too.   Here's some other free/cheap exercise options:Swimming (some days at our local pool swimming is $1 for the session and occasionally they have free days).Walking stairs either at a tall building in the city or at the stadium at our local high school is free.Jumping rope.  We have plenty of rope in the garage.Walking outside (I prefer this to walking inside but it has been too icy lately to do this).Ice skating (one day a week out local ice rink offers \"rent skates\" and skate for free day).Roller skating (our local roller rink charges only $1 to skate on Wednesdays, however the big, fast teenagers scare me when I am skating so I usually opt to pay more and skate with the seniors on Saturday mornings--they are fast but not insane unlike the teens).Bowling (some of the local bowling alleys offer $1 per game, however this is usually during the summer).I sold my bike at our last garage sale but if I still had it, I would definitely go for a ride.We have access to our local military bases which offers a range of free gym services--basketball, racquetball, weights, treadclimber, tennis, stationary bike, yoga classes, kickboxing classes, etc.If you have the equipment (or buy it at the local thrift store or Walmart) you can borrow a community/school facility and play basketball, baseball, tennis, soccer, etc.Playgrounds are free so even if you are a few decades older than everyone else playing there, you can still play on the playground equipment (it helps to borrow a kid and do this so you don't look so odd!).On Saturdays I like to Volksmarch with our local group--they are awesome!The bottom line is that you don't need to spend a cent to exercise.  Walking is free, calisthenics are free, exercise shows on TV or video are free.  There's no excuse!  Get out there and get healthy!"},
{"title": "Starting the New Year off on an Economical Foot", "date": "Saturday, January 1, 2011", "text": "We skipped the New Year's parties and exciting events that were scheduled at many places around Seattle in favor of a quiet (and free) evening at home. Between New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, here's how we kicked off a wonderful, cash-free New Year:On New Year's Eve we stayed home and watched a free On-Demand movie through our cable provider. The movie, Caroline, which I had never heard of, turned out to be quirky, cute, and entertaining. We finished up the evening at midnight watching the fireworks in Seattle on TV then promptly went to sleep.Also yesterday evening, while watching the movie, one of the characters was reading Lady Chatterley's Lover, a book I hadn't read in decades. So I went online and found it for free and read a few chapters. I love free books!It was kind of surreal to wake up and realize I had exactly nothing to do.  I am no longer working (I have worked since I was 14 so this is truly a weird feeling), I am no longer part of any community organizations.  I no longer have any responsibilities.  Surreal.This morning I started my new year off with basically the only thing I want to accomplish this year and that is to exercise daily. I have no excuse not to exercise now considering I don't have a job any more so I hopped on the treadmill for an hour (free), then followed along with an On-Demand yoga class on cable (also free). Unfortunately, I now feel like I have been run over by truck (I am soooo out of shape!).My \"adventure\" for the day, which is the second goal I have for each day this year, was to have hubby give me an awesome massage. He used to massage boxers at his dad's gym and he provides, by far, the best massages I have ever received. Best of all, the price was free!I did my B&O tax worksheet for the past year and found that I earned $50,000 last year which was a surprise considering I worked practically part time the whole year. Unfortunately, I can't account for hardly any of it which just goes to show that while spending cash only keeps you out of debt, there still should be some kind of accounting or else the money will vanish and you will wonder where it went. For this year I will try to tally ALL of the money I spend each day in order to better control it. Unfortunately I won't be working so I won't have much to account for :(  On a happy note, they must have changed the tax laws because when I did the B&O tax worksheet I found that my small business credit was the same amount as what I owed so I ended up owing zero which was a huge surprise!Hubby, besides providing an awesome massage also cooked an awesome dinner which consisted of noodle soup (you need to eat noodles on New Years Day for a long life) with vegetables and shrimp. We figured the entire dinner cost about $2.50 for both of us!Well that's how I started my new year.  I am thinking this will be normal for us now that more than half of our income is gone and we will both be living on hubby's retirement and Social Security.  This looks to be a challenging, yet interesting new year!"},
{"title": "My New Year Resolution", "date": "Thursday, December 30, 2010", "text": "My new year's resolution this year is to have no resolutions! That's right. While other people are writing their lists and checking them twice, I decided to have nothing to do with this time-honored tradition.A few days ago, I dutifully wrote my list of 100 goals for the year. I am a rather list-y person and have, until the last few days, always had a list of things to do. Actually I am known for my lists of things to do and occasionally I write lists of things for other people to do (this is what hastened my departure from my business's main client--seems the new Chairman of the Board was not used to me and when I wrote him a list of things he needed to do he literally flipped out. He was raving about me working for him not the other way around and he was actually turning purple as he was telling me this. That was when I figured out we wouldn't be compatible working together. That was also the impetus for me to close up shop, sell the house, move, and now embark on a year of travel). But I digress.Anyway, I looked at my list of 100 goals. I thought about them. I dreamed about them. Then I wondered why, when at the very moment that my calendar has exactly zero appointments on it for the entire upcoming year, I would jump back into my compulsive need to structure all of my time. So I deleted the list from my computer and gave myself the give of having nothing to do for the foreseeable future.I do have one resolution this year, however. And that is to let each day unfold and see where it leads me. There will be a few parameters, of course. Mostly I will be limited by my finances, or the lack there of. So I anticipate some interesting but relatively cheap/free experiences. I also intend to exercise daily (we'll see how long that vow lasts), and I want to write. Everyday. I have about 75,000 words of a book written that needs to be polished than shopped to a publisher. Also, I want some sort of adventure or new experience every day. That's about it. So my one resolution for the year is to do nothing and let life show me where I am supposed to go. Happy New Year!"},
{"title": "The Great Tampon Shortage", "date": "Monday, December 27, 2010", "text": "Yes, you read that right and no, I never thought I would write such a thing but I was surfing the net a couple days ago and ran across this story which lead me to this story and this story. In a nutshell, ob tampons which many women (including myself) swear by are suddenly unavailable. Then I hopped over to eBay and Amazon. Surely if there is a shortage these pillars of the free market system would know and according to the prices that are now listed on these sites--from $20 to $90 a box for what usually costs $7 a box--there must be some kind of problem.So out I went the next morning in a hunt to bulk up my stocks (actually I was running pretty low and knowing that I was nearly to my monthly PMS freak out, I thought I would be proactive--although I was freaking out a bit nonetheless). I went to Walmart first, no luck. Then Target, no luck. Then Fred Meyers which is a large chain store in our area and their shelves were bare too. Finally I stopped by a small pharmacy which I rarely see anyone shopping at and I raided their shelves. Imagine the surprised look on the cashier's face when I stepped up to the counter with literally an armload of tampons. She didn't ask and I didn't say anything. I then stopped by Safeway, a grocery store, and got their last two boxes so I am set for a while (after spending nearly $100! ouch).When emotion gets wrapped up with your purchases, sometimes common sense goes out the window. And you can't really tell a girl being held hostage by PMS not to be emotional. Sure there are other tampons out there but I don't much care for them as I thought ob was perfect. There are even better, more logical options out there, namely the DivaCup and similar products which are reusable silicon cups that...well suffice it to say that hubby NEVER wants to hear another explanation of what a DivaCup is. But I did do some thorough research and when I get over the ick factor and possibly more desperate, I may give it a try. FYI, for more than you ever wanted to know about \"alternative\" feminine hygiene products, click here. And yes, these alternatives are way cheaper than mainstream products (a one time purchase of $25), way greener (you aren't throwing away wrappers and disposable products because you reuse the product forever), and better in other ways as well (I didn't know you weren't supposed to flush tampons until one day our mainline drain got clogged and the young plumber guy went to work on it and asked if anyone had flushed a mop down the toilet...yikes). So hopefully the powers that be will get the situation figured out and my favorite product will soon be restocked but until then, I am hoarding my supply (hubby did kind of look at my pile of product then look at the prices on Amazon and got dollar signs in his eyes but I told him not to even think about it...)."},

It is a free service that is allowing me to sell all of our possessions before we move.Grocery stores with fully stocked shelves (this is not always the case in many of the places we travel to).Planning and looking forward to exciting travel.Being a minimalist...and realizing that I don't need much \"stuff\" to make me happy.God. I don't really go to church except for as a tourist, however I believe that God puts me where I am supposed to be and makes amazing things possible.Being able to help others (financially, by providing needed things, or just by being able to provide good advice that turns out well for them).The ability to read and write. These two skills have, by far, provided the most joy and inspiration in my life.Having a very good and relatively easy life. When I see they way that others live and some of the tragic/horrible/traumatic things people have gone through, often through no fault of their own both here and abroad, I am truly thankful for the life I have.Having so many possibilities. There are really no limits to the things we can accomplish!Technology. Yep, I am a pretty big tech geek.p.s. Here is a cool picture that one of my wonderful friends gave me.

{"title": "Pretty Soon I Won't Own a House Anymore...", "date": "Thursday, December 23, 2010", "text": "The good news--we got an offer on our house today for our full asking price!The OK news--an offer doesn't mean a sale until I get the signed deed of sale papers in my hot little hands (ie: there are so many things that *could* go wrong and stop a sale that I won't be too excited until the sale is actually final).The bad news--I have owned a house since I was 19 years old and I was looking at my key chain today and have exactly two keys on it, one to my PO Box and one to hubby's car, which technically means that I don't own ANYTHING (legally I still own a house but probably not for long and my house key is in the lock box for the realtor and my key ring is very, very empty!).Surprisingly, I feel very light and not at all unhappy about not owning anything, although it just seems an odd circumstance to find myself in. Some back story: I have been working full time since I was 16 years old.  I bought my first car at 16 (with payments of course...nice intro into consumer debt...) and I bought a house (granted it was nearly 100 years old and something was ALWAYS breaking in it) when I was 19 years old because I wanted the type of security that I thought owning a house conveyed (I had previously lived in about a dozen places and I wanted to feel rooted).Sooo...I have always equated owning a home with being responsible and rooted in the community and that somehow home ownership was a \"better\" choice than being an apartment dweller or worse, living in a trailer (fyi I grew up in a trailer so I'm not slandering those who do, it's just that in our area owning a house was considered much better than any other living option).Owning a house is good for a number of reasons.  When you have a house full of kids, you don't have to worry about being too noisy for the neighbors and you don't have to worry about the kids messing up the apartment to the tune of losing your security deposit.  You can paint the walls, pound all the nails you want into the walls, and put in chartreuse carpet if you like.  A house is a place for family to gather, there is nearly a guarantee that you will build equity in your house which can be looked at like a savings account or retirement fund (definitely not the case over the past couple of years), you have a \"permanent\" address, and you become part of a neighborhood.But there is also a down side to owning a house which I never really looked at before (or maybe I didn't want to acknowledge before).  Houses aren't cheap even if you have a stellar interest rate and low payments.  If something goes wrong in the house YOU get to pay for it (we've replaced carpet, linoleum, hot water tanks, appliances, a furnace, siding, a roof, etc).  If you own a house for years, it's nearly a guarantee that ALL of those things will break at one time or another...a house is a huge financial responsibility!  You can't pick up and travel at the drop of a hat since you need to care for and maintain your home or find someone to do it for you.  You can't quickly move away from mean neighbors, harsh climates, natural disaster areas, and other things that you can do easily if you are a renter.  You, of course, NEED to work so you can pay your house payment, and a house can also be a psychological burden.  I have known quite a few elderly relatives (mostly women because they tend to outlive the men) who held on to their houses way longer than they should have because they felt like it was their duty even if the house was falling down around them and even if they would have actually been much happier in a retirement community in Florida.  But no, they struggled with maintaining the house as best they could, maintained the yard as best they could, paid bills to heat, air condition, and decorate houses than once housed large families but which they were now the sole occupant of.  Which isn't to say that retirees shouldn't live out their life in their own home, just that is shouldn't be a socially or psychologically imposed requirement.Now, my views on home ownership are not nearly as rigid as they used to be.  I have learned that a \"home\" is more important than a house and that financially sacrificing yourself for a house which society deems as \"necessary\" doesn't make much sense at all.  In fact, some of the blogs I follow are from people who are technically \"homeless\" but have truly amazing lives.  Like these people, these people, and this lady.  I have found more of a feeling of \"home\" in the run down apartments of illegal immigrants than in grand mansions.  I have also seen people much less stressed and enjoying more time with their families and hobbies when they didn't have a huge mortgage hanging over their heads.I am hoping our foray into joining the ranks of the \"homeless\" will provide even more lessons on actually living instead of just acquiring.  Can I get an amen?"},
{"title": "The Art of Compromise", "date": "Wednesday, December 22, 2010", "text": "As we were rolling full steam ahead on our plan to clear out our house (it's nearly half empty now!) and get ready to travel, I noticed that hubby was looking sadder and sadder.  Although he is pretty much on board with our plan, he seriously hates change.  He is firmly stuck in his rut and happy to be there, however, if there is something I want to do he will dutifully follow along.  So along he is going with this half crazy plan to sell everything and travel the world before deciding when and where to settle down again.We (I) had originally intended to sell literally everything before we left but hubby said that he really didn't want to be 62 years old and only have the items he could fit in a backpack to his name.  Did I mention he likes security and stability?  Also, he is from a very class-oriented culture so he feels like people judge him by the stuff he has and if he doesn't have anything he would be nothing.  Well that made me take a step back.  I really feel like my plan is sound and that he will appreciate the things we will be able to do without the huge overhead of a house and possessions to weigh us down, but when you are married you do need to take the other person's feelings into consideration.Over the years we have learned to compromise on quite a few things--he is a hoarder and I am a minimalist, having lots of stuff makes him feel happy and comfortable yet for me, having lots of stuff makes me feel like the weight of responsibility is piled up on my shoulders.  So we have worked around our various conundrums quite well.  I just think that the sudden rush of all of his possessions being sold and carried away really got to him.So here is the compromise...I checked with a local storage place and for $50 a month we can store some basic stuff that he really wants to keep (a bed, a futon sofa he loves, and a dozen crates of personal possessions).  Hubby seems a bit happier to have some stuff rather than to have no stuff.  The second thing I did was go to check out some senior apartments in our area.  The apartments are small but so is the price, the locations is great, the building is new, and they have tons of amenities.  I presented this option to hubby so that if we got tired of traveling or hanging out with relatives (our original plan was to \"homebase\" out of his sister's home however hubby said he would prefer his \"own\" place), there is always the option to rent an apartment that would meet all of our needs.  Again, he seemed relieved to have another option besides \"grab your backpack and we'll land somewhere\".And therein lies the art of compromise.  When you are making plans for anyone other than yourself, jarring changes may be a bit overwhelming to them and of course they may push back rather than go along, so it is always a good idea to provide a variety of options so that they can feel like they can have some sort of control over the situation. ...Gee all of that and I don't even have a psychology degree!"},
{"title": "Our Annual Bill Paying Plan", "date": "Saturday, December 18, 2010", "text": "For most of my financial life, I have got by just paying the \"minimum payment due\".  Obviously not a good thing, especially when paying credit card, car, and other debt because you can justify any loan amount if you are only looking at \"small monthly payments\" as opposed to the total amount owed.Fortunately, our debt is just about paid off so there won't be any minimum monthly credit card or car payments, however, now I am looking at the monthly payments on our regular bills and have come up with a new annual bill paying plan.  Here's how it will work:Our current debts include a mortgage payment (which includes property tax and house insurance), health insurance, car insurance, water, garbage, sewer, electric, gas, cable, cell phones, tithe, school for a grandchild, and taxes.As soon as we move (our house is in the process of being sold) and we become nomadic, our bills will drop to health insurance, car insurance, cell phones, tithe, school for the grandchild, and taxes.  We plan to pay these remaining six bills on an annual basis.  We are doing this for a couple of reasons--one, while we are traveling, we won't have to worry about paying monthly bills, and two, often when you pay annually instead of monthly, you get a discount.  In January we will pay $600 for a year of health insurance and $200 for six months of car insurance, putting $200 in savings for the second half of the year's car insurance since this can only be paid bi-annually.  I have already put aside $500 for our grandson's school (in the Philippines, you have to actually pay to go to school, even elementary school), and we also have money in savings to pay our 2010 taxes which will be due in April (since I am self employed we always end up paying something to the IRS).  The only things that we aren't paying annually are the cell phones (they are still on a contract so we will be paying this bill monthly), and tithe (since I tithe 10% of my income and have no idea how much income I will have in the coming year).I hope to reduce these bills even further in a few ways: obviously health insurance will be a constant bill and at this low price I am more than happy to pay it however it will drop in half in a couple of years when hubby goes on Medicare.  We think that eventually we may sell the car and be totally car free so that would preclude the need for car insurance.  Our cell phones will eventually be of the pre-paid variety and I think our taxes will be reduced significantly beginning in January because I won't be working (my goal is to live so minimally and need so little that we end up paying zero taxes).  Tithing will continue as usual at 10%, and while we are in the Philippines next month, I will talk to the grandson's family about setting them up a small business of some sort with some seed money so that they can pay for his school out of the proceeds of the business thus ending our commitment to pay his school fees for the next decade or so.Obviously there will be other variable costs we will pay just for living like food, clothes, sundries, and \"rent\" of sorts to whoever we are staying with but these will be reduced as much as possible (and will be some good topics for future blog posts!)."},
{"title": "I Love Free Stuff!", "date": "Monday, December 13, 2010", "text": "I am holding onto my money so tight these days that ole Ben Franklin is practically screaming.  So how do I keep my money instead of letting it run through my fingers like it usually does?  Easy, I go in search of free stuff, including:Hubby's computer got a virus.  His first thought was to haul it over to the Geek Squad but I used Google to figure out the problem (indeed it was a virus) and how to fix it (reboot the computer in safe mode then restore it to an earlier restore time point).  I was so surprised I was actually able to fix the computer and hubby was amazed too!And to prevent the virus from happening again, I went to www.download.com and downloaded some free (but good!) anti virus software (AVG).  They also have all kinds of other software to download on the site at no charge.Instead of hunting for the perfect calendar for my purse and paying for it (I may be the last person on the planet to eschew the calendar on my smart phone for a calendar booklet), I simply had hubby stop by his bank and pick up free calendar booklets that they hand out this time of year.  I actually really love these small calendars which are the perfect size to fit in my purse but still have big enough spaces each day to write down the stuff I have to do.  Best of all, they're free!Walking through the mall a few days ago, I came away with free samples from See's Candies and Hickory Farms.  Yum!  Also, although the membership isn't free (actually it is for me as a client gives me a free membership card each year) you can also fill up at no charge by walking through the food section at Costco a couple of times...we sometimes do this on Sunday's when we are bored (and hungry).My library is growing thinner as we get rid of nearly everything we own.  But I was bored the other night and looking for a good book to read and seeing as how all I have now are a bunch of non fiction books and not a single trashy romance brain candy novel at my disposal, I went online to www.amazon.com and downloaded their free Kindl e-reader for my computer then went to town downloading free books from the site.  I got some great reads absolutely free!I went to our community library today and checked out some books.  I almost always hang out at Barnes and Noble and just read books from the shelves but when I go there it is my habit to always buy a drink in their cafe which now runs about $4 a beverage.  Instead of depleting my money and increasing my waist size, I decided to give the library a shot and found a whole stack of great books.  For free!CraigsList is awesome...and free!  Since we are in the middle of getting rid of nearly everything we own so we can travel for the next year or so, I can't rave enough about the free ads I can place on CraigsList.  CraigsList is hands-down the best way to advertise the stuff I have for sale and we have been able to get rid of plenty of things at reasonable prices this way.Filling out a simple form got me a $50 Visa gift card which just came in the mail today.  Actually I did have to buy a smart phone through my wireless carrier but I got a great deal on it because I renewed my contract with them.  When I got the phone, they gave me everything I needed to fill out to get the rebate which I quickly mailed in and ta-da, the gift card came in the mail today.  I know some people who think it is too much hassle to fill out rebate forms but it is usually super simple and definitely worth the small amount of time it takes to do this.And then there is my penchant for whining and throwing a fit, especially when I have a consumer problem.  Actually I probably am not that bad but when I had numerous problems with said smart phone above, I went to the retail store and called their customer service line to complain (a lot).  The result after having about five issues with the new phone was a replacement for the phone and they are even sending me another phone absolutely free so I will end up with two brand new phones, one of which I will eBay and get the cash from it.  Complaining works!Leftovers are free too, relatively speaking.  I mean you have already paid for the groceries or restaurant meal so why let the leftovers go to waste?  Americans throw out literally tons and tons of food each year.  I used to be one of those people but now we make a conscious effort to eat as many leftovers as possible and therefore waste very little food.That's all I can think of now.  Besides, my leftover turkey is warming up in some gravy and is just about ready to pour over some leftover rice for dinner tonight."},
{"title": "Financial Transparency", "date": "Thursday, December 9, 2010", "text": "I was trying to think of a catchy title for this article but thought that the title \"If you don't pay attention to your money it could lead to embezzlement, various forms of addiction (gambling and drugs for example), and affairs\" seemed a bit long and off-putting.  It is however, the truth.  As I have seen a few times with businesses and more than enough times in families, when there is only one person watching the money, there is a lot more temptation to do stuff with the money that you shouldn't do.  These are the things you should do with your money, whether it is money in your business or money in your home (obviously if you are single and have no one to answer to this may not be as applicable):You should have a written budget at the beginning of each month which lists what money is coming in and where it is going.  When everyone knows how much is coming in and how much is going out (as well as where the money is going to) there is less of a chance that the money could be diverted and used for illicit purposes (ie: used to fund a shopping or drug addiction).There should be a clear separation of powers when it comes to your money, meaning that one person is not in charge of everything when it comes to banking, writing checks, paying the bills, etc.  Although I would like to give you the gristly details of a business that is still under investigation for financial mismanagement, I can't.  Suffice it to say that one person was in charge of the money for years and no one else in the business knows exactly where the money went because there was only one set of eyes on the entire financial process...it will probably turn out to be a lengthy and litigious situation.Everyone who has access to the money should account for both income and expenses in writing and this tally should be balanced against the bank statement each month.  Unfortunately, this is how my friend found out that her husband was having an affair.  He would take money out of their account, not write down what it was used for, put money back into the account to cover the purchases, and he never thought that she would know that he had bought various things for his new girlfriend because they weren't in the habit of balancing their bank registers against their bank statements and she rarely even saw a bank statement come in.  Until one day she did look at the statement and that was pretty much the end of their marriage.Each person should have a small \"slush fund\" of sorts.  In business, of course, you want clear accounting and receipts for everything, however money represents power in a relationship and each person in the family should have a small (notice I didn't say large) amount of money that they can use as they please and not have to account to anyone for it.The bottom line rule is that there should be no lying and complete financial transparency with your money.  If you or your spouse or your employee needs to lie about money then there is a big problem.  It might be a communications problem (like I said before, a power \"you can't tell me what to do\" issue) or it could signify something bigger (like hiding money to use for a gambling problem)."},
{"title": "10 Things About Your Emergency Fund", "date": "Wednesday, December 8, 2010", "text": "My emergency fund has saved me on more than a few occasions.  Everything from late checks to car problems to house problems have been quickly remedied because I had the cash on hand to cover the \"emergency\".  Here's ten things I have learned about having an emergency fund:$1,000 is a good amount to start with for an emergency fund.  Although some people say you need six month's worth of living expenses in your emergency fund, when you are digging out of debt, a smaller emergency fund is fine.  Let the bulk of your extra money pay down 18% debt instead of parking it in an account earning a paltry 1%.You can put $1,000 in an emergency fund in fairly short order.  When I first heard (from Dave Ramsey) that I needed an emergency fund, I was so deep in debt I thought there was no way I would be able to put that much money aside and not use it.  After all, nearly every day I was having a financial emergency (usually of my own making).  However, it is amazing what you can do when you are 110% focused on a goal.  I CraigsListed stuff, I eBayed stuff, I sold my jewelry, I forced myself to put money into the emergency fund first before paying anything else.  In less than a month I had my small emergency fund set.  And you can too.The stars will conspire against you as soon as you get your emergency fund set up.  I don't know what the deal is but I have heard this from many people.  As soon as they had an emergency fund, emergencies started happening on a regular basis.  I remember our furnace went out in the dead of winter ($985), the car's engine started sucking air (I'm not sure what the problem was but it cost over $800 to fix), another car problem cost $900+ to fix, someone threw a rock through our window (I think they had the wrong house but the damage cost $500 to fix)...you get the idea.  The good part was that we had the money in our emergency fund to fix these problems where as before we would have just added it to the credit cards, paid the minimum monthly payments, and ended up even further in debt.When Murphy's Law starts hitting you from all sides, you need to refocus your efforts, and any time your emergency fund drops below $1,000 you need to immediately work to build it up again.  Eventually another cosmic law takes over and the emergencies seem to taper off leaving your emergency fund in tact for longer and longer periods of time.Your emergency fund can be used only for emergencies.  Your emergencies.  It is tempting when you have money \"just sitting there\" to qualify all kinds of things as an emergency.  Your retail therapy sessions, your friend's latest crisis, a much needed vacation, etc.  Don't do it.  Unless there is a possibility you could DIE unless you use the money (no furnace in January certainly qualified) then don't touch your emergency fund.You want your emergency fund in a safe, yet liquid, place.  This generally means a bank savings account.  Leaving that much cash at home can be too tempting to you (and burglars!).  Putting the money is a CD or IRA means you can't get at it when you need it without penalties.  You can use your emergency fund for inspiration.  When I first put my emergency fund together and got the bank statement showing that I had a little over $1,000 in my savings account, I posted the bank statement right next to my computer where I would see it every morning.  This inspired me to keep working at paying off my debt.  After all, if I could have $1,000 on a bank statement with my name on it, I could do anything!Don't tell anyone about your emergency fund.  I don't know about you, but most of my family is flat broke.  If they had heard I had $1,000 in cash, they would have come up with all sorts of very convincing reasons that they needed to \"borrow\" money from me.  And from experience I know that they are generally never able to pay me back.  It is just easier all around if you keep your emergency fund to yourself.Make your emergency fund work for you.  Now that you have some money, you might as well make it earn its keep.  Unfortunately, interest rates are super low at this point, however make sure you are at least earning something on your money by putting it in an interest-bearing account.Your emergency fund should grow just as soon as you pay off your debts.  This is another Dave Ramsey rule and it makes absolute sense.  When you are debt free, you will have lots of extra cash to put towards growing your emergency fund to what is normally considered adequate--about six to nine month's worth of living expenses.  The good news is that this number will now be lower than when you began your journey because your living expenses will be minus all of the debts (and therefore monthly payments) that you just paid off.Do you have an emergency fund?  If the answer is no, I can't recommend highly enough that you make putting together a small, $1000 emergency fund your most important task.  Start now!"},
{"title": "Bad Habits", "date": "Tuesday, December 7, 2010", "text": "I would probably be wealthy, or at least have more money, if it weren't for my bad habits.My worst habit is Starbucks and assorted other coffee shops.  Oddly enough, I can't stand the taste of coffee but going to a coffee shop nearly every day is a habit that is #1 making me fat, and #2 making me broke.  For the record, I will often have a hot chocolate or a green tea frapuccino instead of coffee.  Anyway, it is hard to change this habit because, at least in our area, going to coffee shops whether with friends or alone is just something many people do each day.  Coffee shops are a great place to socialize and also a great place to relax (my favorite Starbucks is located in Barnes and Noble where I can both relax and read which are my two all-time favorite things to do).  But when you do this every day it becomes a habit and when you have a habit that includes parting with your hard-earned cash each day it becomes a black hole for your money.  Not good.My second worst habit is buying stuff for people.  I guess I am a people pleaser and I also have the habit of seeing things that people \"need\" and wanting to get it for them.  Case in point, I went to the Coach outlet store this weekend and I found the perfect bag that I have been looking for (it was even 50% off retail plus an additional 30% off so it was a super bargain).  But that wasn't the problem.  I had planned to buy the bag and I had the cash to buy it, however my sister was shopping with me and on the spur of the moment I decided to buy her something as well.  Even though I had the cash to buy her a purse, it wasn't something I had planned.  She was looking at the bag wistfully and I knew she couldn't afford it and it only took about thirty seconds to justify my purchasing the bag for her--she has five kids, she is a great, hard-working mom, she never treats herself, she has never had a Coach purse and has always really wanted on, Christmas is coming up...  I tend to do this all the time.  If I can make someone happy by getting them something, I can instantly justify the purchase.  At least now I am limited by the cash I have to spend.  It was much worst when I had a wallet full of credit cards...So with my looming unemployment coming up, I am now more aware than ever that I need to reign in my bad habits.  How to accomplish this is another question."},

{"title": "\"How Can You Do That?\"", "date": "Thursday, December 2, 2010", "text": "I was at the bank today, doing one of the myriad tasks that I need to get done before we leave next month, and the banker I was talking to about switching around a couple of accounts asked why I was doing this so I gave him a quick \"we are planning to travel for the next year or so\" which kind of brought everyone in the office to a stand still.  His manager came over and sat down and started chatting and the ladies in the few desks that were near his seemed to be inordinately interested in our conversation.Both of the bankers wanted to know how we could possibly do such a thing (btw, as they were asking if they could sign me up for a credit card because they saw in my account that I didn't have one of their bank credit cards...go figure).So I gave them my quick recap of how we really could do such a thing, using their question about the credit card as a segue.  I simply told them that we are able to do such a thing because:We don't use credit cards or carry debt.We drive one old, paid off car.We are selling our house so we won't have house payments to make.Our kids are grown so we don't need to worry about #1 supporting them or #2 all of the extra stuff that is involved when you travel with kids. I have (a currently very small) income from my online businesses.We have some, but not a lot, of savings.Hubby is retired with both a pension and social security (it is an adequate amount to live on in the US yet it some foreign countries such an income would allow us to live very, very well).We have minimal stuff and in fact, we are selling off almost everything we have.That was probably way more information than they expected but they certainly paid attention.  The bottom line, is that you can pretty much have anything you want--a nice house, a brand new car, travel, a closet full of designer bags, the latest and greatest tech stuff--it just depends on what your priorities are.  It may be difficult to have all of those things at the same time due to financial constraints but if you want one of those things, it is entirely possible to dedicate your work and your income to having said item."},

Now for some businesses, that might not be a big deal, after all, you can get other clients, but for me, this was definitely a big deal.  Firstly, they are my main client, the one which provides the income to pay my mortgage, and I have been with them for over eight years.  Secondly, as many will tell you, because the economy is so crappy, now is hardly a good time to make oneself purposely unemployed.  Thirdly, I have never actually quit a job without having something better lined up and in this case, I have exactly nothing lined up. Yikes.But, after all of the drama at the organization over the past few months, doing this just felt like the right thing to do.  It seemed like the natural time to let this situation dissolve into the past and move forward with new projects (what projects, I have no idea).So here I sit, pondering my future, wired up on caffeine, and feeling unusually free for the first time in decades.A possible omen of better things to come...I ran across a book at Barnes and Noble today (I think the title was How to Stop Worrying and Start Living) which had a great quote to live by.  The way to awesomeness (I'm paraphrasing) is to stop worrying about yesterday, don't worry about tomorrow, but focus on today and be awesome (again, paraphrasing).  Definitely words to live by.  I can hardly wait to see what awesome things I will do tomorrow."},
{"title": "10 Great Money-Saving Reasons to Radically Downsize Your Life", "date": "Monday, November 29, 2010", "text": "We are in the middle of a radical downsizing of our life (see previous posts). We are moving from the typical American lifestyle (big house, lots of expensive junk that we never use, horrible consumer habits, etc) to something quite different (renting a room for a home base and traveling with just what we can carry in our suitcases). This experience has been hands-down, one of the best ways to save money that I have ever found. Here's why:We don't/can't shop for stuff any more. Since we are in the process of getting rid of stuff, it doesn't make sense to bring any more stuff into our house so shopping trips have been reduced and when I do find something I want, I realize that soon I won't have anywhere to put it so I don't buy it.Knowing that we have a deadline looming, it really brings into focus what is important--namely bulking up our savings as much as possible.We aren't spending much on food these days. Our goal is to skip going out to eat (we haven't done this much lately anyway) so that we can eat up the food we have in our cabinets instead of packing it up and giving it away.Instead of being consumers, we are now on the other side of the equation--I am selling stuff like a maniac on EBay and Craigslist.While we still have one car, we are looking at the possibility of eventually being totally car free. If we do end up traveling mostly overseas like we have planned, we will have no need of a car. I didn't realize how much a car actually costs until I got rid of my car. I had had a car since I was 16 and didn't think twice about paying all of the expenses that went along with it (car payment, insurance, maintenance, parking, etc) until I got rid of my car and found that I had an extra $800 to $1000 PER MONTH!The purchases we do make are now analyzed, scrutinized, and evaluated for overall usefulness and cost. Now instead of needing a half dozen fleece jackets, I need one. When determining what kind of camera to get, I decided on a nice (and inexpensive) small point and shoot type instead of the multi-lens (and much bigger and expensive) SLR camera. Ditto for the one good pair of walking shoes, the couple of pairs of pants and t shirts (instead of multitudes), etc.When I review our bill list each month, I literally can not wait to sell the house and move. Our monthly bills will radically drop because we will be paying a small, flat fee for a room instead of huge heating bills in the winter, cable TV/internet/phone, utilities, a big house payment, etc.I'm not stockpiling stuff like I used to. I used to be the coupon queen. If I could buy a dozen bottles of dish soap because they were on sale and I had coupons, I would be in heaven. Now I look around and the cabinets are almost bare and I feel surprisingly much better, like the great weight of being responsible for so much stuff has been lifted off of me (this has also saved me a lot of money!).I don't have any credit cards, hubby has one more to pay off, and when we do this, we will be saving money that would have otherwise went to interest. Oddly enough, I used to feel so secure with a wallet full of credit cards. These days I look in my wallet that contains my ID and a couple of debit cards and I feel indescribably light and free.I think my health will improve the more we downsize. No car means more walking. Less work means more time for yoga and walking. More freedom means less stress. All of these things will probably save money on health costs.I'm sure we will realize even more financial benefits as we continue on with our journey"},
{"title": "35 Days Til the Big Move", "date": "Friday, November 26, 2010", "text": "Our goal: to have our house sold/in the process of being sold, to have my portable business set up and generating income, to get rid of basically everything we own except what we can fit in our suitcases, and be on a plane to Japan by December 31, 2010 (the end of next month!).Some back story: we have been toying with the idea of selling everything and traveling for more than a year. We have been inching towards such a goal since the idea first came to me, but now things are in motion and it looks like our \"drop dead\" date for the goal will be the end of next month (yikes). It's interesting how when you set your mind to something the universe starts arranging things to help you reach your goal. And it's scary. In theory, the goal seems wonderful but the closer we come to making it a reality, the crazier the idea seems. What if what I am doing is a big mistake? What if this isn't what we should be doing after all? What if we (namely I) fail miserably? The hubby thinks the idea is insane but he would literally follow me to the ends of the earth so he is willing to go along with whatever I want to do (and I think he is secretly excited about the whole idea too). It's so easy to stay in the rut of everyday life--it is so comfortable there! So I re-read this article and this article and while I am still wondering what the heck I have got us into, I also realize that change, and the fear that comes with it, is normal.So here's the overall plan:Sell the house and everything in it.Rent a room from a cousin who lives near us to store a few boxes of personal possessions that we will pick up and bring with us when we get back from Asia. We will also be storing our car at his place too.Go to Japan for a week or so then head to the Philippines. Stay in the Philippines until March.At the end of March come back to our Seattle-area town and stay in our rented room at the cousin's house for the month of April while I prep for a bike ride.Bike from Canada to Mexico during the month of May (hubby will follow along in the van which will also carry our few personal possessions to our new home base in Atlanta).Arrive at the US-Mexico border on April 30th, drive to Las Vegas for a few days, then on to Colorado to visit our sons and their families.Take a leisurely drive from Colorado to Atlanta where we will be renting the guest suite at my sister in law's home. We figure we will be arriving around June 1st and we will be making this our \"home base\". Drop off our stuff.Head to Connecticut where we will visit family for the summer (June, July, and August) since it is hot as Hell in Atlanta in the summer.Head back to Atlanta in the fall. We plan to go on a couple of cruises out of Florida and possibly go to Europe during the early and late fall.What we've done so far:Listed the house for sale.Set up a private mail box that will hold our mail then forward it to where ever we are (we want to maintain our residency in our current state).Updated some of my tech stuff (I bought a new camera, some memory cards and USB drives) and decided not to upgrade other stuff (my laptop and netbook still work well and although I would like the latest computers with all the bells and whistles, I think it is more important to save my money for other stuff...like travel expenses). What we need to do:CraigsList the bigger furniture items.EBay some smaller electronics items.Have an \"estate\" sale to sell everything else in the house.Sell the house, of course.Decide what stuff we will keep (likely pictures, important files, and some small stuff but everything else has to go including some antiques that I will miss).Give my \"final, final\" notice to the place that I work for (I gave notice a month ago, they asked me to stay, I agreed, and it has been dismal since then so I really think it is time to go. I will, however, try to work out some contracting with them that I can do long distance).Resign from a couple of community Boards that I am on. I volunteer just about everywhere but I am particularly active with a couple of non-profits so I will be giving them my notice as well.Pay off hubby's last remaining credit card with the proceeds from the sale of our stuff.Put all other money we generate into our emergency and travel funds.Forward all of our mail to our new mailing addressGet some business cards made with our new info on it (I like Moo cards).Make a few repairs on the house (like fixing the fence, part of which blew down during last week's storm).Sign up for the military \"Space A\" flight which will take us to Japan for the sum total of $10 (it's a perk of the hubby being retired from the military and will save us an armload of cash on our overseas flights).Once the house sells we will:Bank all of the proceeds from the sale.Pay off the final utility bills (we will leave money with the cousin to do this as we will likely be out of the country when it sells and sending mail from the Philippines is pretty unreliable).And after the first of the year we will need to:Do our 2010 taxes as well as B & O taxes.And our expenses will roughly be:$500 to send one grandkid to school in the Philippines (a lump sum for all of next year)Cell phones ($80 a month since we are still under contract for another year)Tithe (I do this monthly based on my income. I am guessing this will go down since I won't have a regular, steady income)Taxes (another lump sum to be submitted with my 2010 tax return).Car insurance ($45 a month which we will pay in lump sums twice a year. We had considered dropping car insurance for the months we are gone but then we won't be insured if we drive anyone else's car so decided to keep it).Health insurance ($35 a month. A bargain, which gets withheld from the hubby's retirement pay each month)Basic living expenses (rent, food, clothing, toiletries, entertainment, etc). In the Philippines these costs will be much less than what we have been paying for our household in the US and, when we get back, renting a room will also be much less than what we have been paying to maintain our own house (I figure it will be a savings of about $2,000 a month over the cost of a mortgage, utilities, home repair, house insurance, property tax, et al).So that's it so far. And the most important lesson from this....without living the cash-only life style and being debt free, none of this would have happened. We would still be stuck on the hamster wheel of charge up the credit cards, work more to pay debt, get depressed about our debt and being forced to work to bring in an income to pay the debts, charge more stuff to make us feel happier temporarily, ad nauseum. Being debt free, having money in savings, and cutting expenses to the bare minimum really does allow us to do basically anything we want to do."},
{"title": "When a Weather Disaster Happens, You Need This Stuff", "date": "Tuesday, November 23, 2010", "text": "The last few days have been a whirlwind of snow, icy roads, sub-freezing days and nights, a power outage, and a shuffling of relatives who came for the holidays and were surprised by the treacherous weather. Even though I would much rather hang onto my cash these days, when a winter storm hits, these items can be priceless:Flashlights and extra batteries.A battery-operated radio.A car cell phone charger.A cell phone that allows internet access.A shovel.A windshield scraper.Candles and matches.A fireplace with lots of seasoned firewood.Extra blankets.Winter clothing (heavy jacket, hat, gloves) and winter boots.Food that is simple to prepare and eat and which doesn't require cooking.Tire chains.A chain or rope (to pull or be pulled from a ditch).Bottled water.Pipe and faucet insulation.An alternate heat source (like a kerosene heater).An alternate cooking source (like a camp stove).A full tank of gas.Other stuff you can't do without and can't easily access if roads are impassible (prescription medicines, diapers, extra oxygen canisters, etc).A generator and fuel.A chainsaw and fuel.Obviously it would be pretty expensive to run out and buy all of these things at once, however it is a good idea to start with the things that are most important to you (in my case, flashlights, a radio, and bottled water) and put aside a little money each month to stock your emergency supply kit. Also, many of these items can be bought cheaper than retail by purchasing the items at the dollar store, the thrift store, and at garage sales. Finally, you may not need all of these items. Apartment dwellers probably won't need a chainsaw or generator. If you don't have a car, you can skip the tank of gas, tow rope, and window scraper."},
{"title": "Another Quick Update", "date": "Friday, November 19, 2010", "text": "It seems like all I have been posting lately is updates but things seem to be moving rather quickly around here...We listed our house for sale (again) this morning and had a potential buyer look at it this afternoon.  Tomorrow I will take my friend's advice and toss a small piece of our house (a small piece of wood from one of the beams in the garage) and throw it into the canal by our house.  She said fast moving water so I hope that counts.  She said that when she did that, thus releasing her house to new buyers, her house sold in three days!A while back I reported that hubby had agreed to cut out his expensive Philippine stations from our cable plan (saving about $70 a month!).  He recently found that he could watch shows from all of the stations in the Philippines for free online.  So now he is a happy camper, he has told many of his family members about this (they too are talking about cancelling cable now), and we are now considering cancelling cable all together.I met up with a friend today who I haven't seen in a couple of months.  Her husband passed away last week and we had a long chat about everything that had happened while I was away on vacation.  This kind of reinforced a bunch of things for me, namely that you never know when someone will die (he had some medical issues but they were scheduled to leave on a cruise today) so I want to spend as much time as possible with the hubby now before it is too late (he is 20 years older than me and not getting any younger!).  She also wondered out loud about what she would do with all of her stuff (they were both well employed, had a huge house, and owned nearly every material item known to man); ironically she said they bought so much stuff so that the other would be happy but he couldn't take it with him and she doesn't care about the stuff, her only thought now is that he is gone and she is miserable.  Kind of realigns one's priorities in a hurry.Hubby is now on board with selling everything in the house before we move.  Before he was pretty tied to his stuff but today he was making plans for an \"estate sale\".  The realtor said it is better to list it as such instead of as a garage sale because #1 we are selling everything in the house (thus 'estate') and #2 people like to go to garage sales in the summer and estate sales year round.  Makes sense to me!FYI--Tomorrow is National Survivors of Suicide Day.  Events will be held all over the country and a webcast will be available online.  We're throwing a \"farewell party/big Thanksgiving day blow out\" at our house next week.  Since we don't have much family around where we live, we usually meet up with another couple and go out for dinner for the holiday, however it honor of pretty soon not having a house, we figured that this may be one of the last times we will be able to throw such a big party.  I have been hunting down loss leaders at local stores for the past two weeks and I think we have everything we need for dinner.  We have invited lots of friends and acquaintances, I got a huge turkey for 27 cents a pound, and we are semi cleaning out our cabinets (so we won't have lots of food left when we move) and will probably be cooking up some interesting dishes along with the usual fare (don't know what I will do with 20 cans of pinto beans but I am guessing they will end up on the menu  somehow).  As usual, I am using cash to purchase everything."},
{"title": "10 Steps to Get a Grip When You're Overwhelmed", "date": "Tuesday, November 16, 2010", "text": "Stepping back into my life after a long vacation was a bit overwhelming.  All of the work, responsibilities, and basic \"stuff\" was just waiting for my return.  How to get a handle on it?  Here's what I did:Get a good night's sleep and forget about everything until the morning.  I work much better in the morning after a good night's sleep.  I am practically useless by evening time.  Some people are just the opposite but for me, mornings are when I do my best work.Clean the house and do laundry.  I can't function well when my \"inner circle\" area, namely my home, is a mess.  It clouds my thinking and adds to the weight of stuff that I feel is overwhelming me.Gather and organize all of the \"incoming\" stuff.  This includes going through all of the mail, email, phone messages, etc.  Tossing out the junk and sorting stuff into \"respond now\" and \"later\" piles.Make my office \"grand central\".  Depending on the amount of stuff I have to do, my desk and sometimes the entire floor may be covered with piles of stuff to do.Organize piles and lists.  List #1 is a list of stuff to buy (laundry soap, for example, which I noticed we were almost out of when I did laundry.  The list gets longer as I go through my piles), list #2 is a list of errands to do (pick up birthday cake for friend, drop off outgoing mail, etc), list #3 is phone calls to make, pile #1 may be things that can be done quickly (write letter for X), pile #2 may be longer term things (write report on X), and pile #3 are things that will take a half day or more of concerted effort to complete.Start to work on each list then pile.  List #1 is on the desk ready to go with me when I leave, I review list #2 to see if there is anything that I need to get ready when I leave to do errands (ie: if it says pay bills, I need to get the bill, write the check, and make sure the envelope has a stamp on it), I then sit down and call everyone on list #3, and depending on the time, do everything that needs to be done in pile #1.  I usually save pile #2 for the next morning when I can focus on working specifically on whittling down the pile, then schedule blocks of time to do things in pile #3.The next day, after I get a lot of things done, I can usually merge all of the lists into one to include leftover errands, messages to return, and things to buy.The next day, I also try to block out time to finish up everything in pile #1 and pile #2.By the following day, I usually have the bigger projects left so I try to set aside a day or even a half day to hammer away on these projects.Reward myself for my diligent effort with a frapuccino from Starbucks!"},
{"title": "I'm Back--An Update", "date": "Sunday, November 14, 2010", "text": "Our six week vacation came to an end and now we are back home.  Here's an update:Our house is going back on the market on Wednesday.  I can't wait to be \"home free\" (note I didn't say \"homeless\"!).I had a \"come to Jesus\" meeting with the Executive Board of the organization I contract with.   Instead of accepting my letter terminating my contract with them, they overwhelmingly wanted me to stay.  I thought I was in the Twilight Zone!  But at least a significant part of my income will remain in tact for now.Oddly enough, when the Board went into Executive session to discuss me, I got a phone call with a job offer from a friend, completely out of the blue.  Serendipity?  Or the universe applauding my bravery?I had the opportunity while we were on vacation to barter a couple of jobs.  I did some web design work for a couple of businesses and ended up with a handful of spa passes and a dozen Christmas trees.  I love bartering!We are building up our savings and hope to go to Asia in December.When we got back from vacation, I came back to a full slate of meetings and a huge amount of responsibilities that I had got used to now worrying about when I was gone.  I can't wait to move to a more location independent lifestyle a la this article.Finally, now that I have time to kick back and surf the 'net (at least more so than when I was on vacation), I have time to find great articles like this, which reminded me of many of the frugal lessons that my grandmother taught me."},
{"title": "10 Things that \"Everyone\" Does But Most of Us Shouldn't", "date": "Sunday, November 7, 2010", "text": "It is so easy to go along with the crowd. I think we learn this in junior high school. In elementary school, kids pretty much do what they want to do, not knowing or caring what others think. Then as kids approach their 'tweens, everyone else's opinion suddenly becomes so important that they forget about what they actually want to do and just follow the crowd. Advertisers learned this lesson early and have put it to good use...show people what \"everyone else\" is doing then make us feel like we will be less acceptable if they don't follow along in kind. Here's ten things that almost everyone else does but that I am slowly learning to rebel against:1) You need a car. Every adult needs a car. I haven't owned a car in maybe five years. I finally couldn't justify paying nearly $1000 a month just for a car when I was supremely happy taking public transportation anytime we traveled. I figured that if I could take a bus in a third world country sitting next to a chicken on one side of me and a drooly baby on the other, and still be amused by life, then I could probably take public transportation in my own home town. And so far this has worked out very well. Now hubby and I share his car or I ride the bus and it has literally saved me thousands and thousands of dollars.2) You need a house to be a rooted, responsible person. I am moving more towards the thought that you need a clean, warm, safe place to live. It need not be a house with a mortgage. In fact, the lower the maintenance on your home (ie: no mowing the grass, re roofing at regular intervals, finding a new pool man, redecorating every season, etc) the more time, and probably money, you will have to actually enjoy your life. I am dispensing with my house as soon as I get home next week. I am set on making my sister-in-law's guest house in Atlanta my new digs as soon as possible.3) You need a college degree. I have always wanted a college degree just for the status of having one. I dropped out of college after three years because it just didn't make sense to pay tens of thousands of dollars to get a degree in order to get a job that would have actually paid me less than the job I had that supported me while I was in college. I guess getting a degree is a math equation that people don't often ask themselves.4) You need a lot of expenses that you can use for tax deductions. These may include the interest on your home, business expenses, etc. My new thought on this is that it would make more sense to buy less stuff and work less in order to pay less taxes than to earn more and buy lots of stuff in order to get a fraction of the costs that you expend back in tax deductions.5) You need a lot of stuff to have a fulfilling life. My in laws are amazing, wonderful people but it has been like I am trapped in an unending commercial while we have been with them. Granted, in their culture, status is of extreme importance. Where you live, what you buy, which credit cards you have, what kind of purse you carry, where you go on vacation...basically everything they do is dictated by what people in general will think of them. In their culture, people are judged mostly by these outward signs of wealth and prosperity. Fortunately in our culture, especially with the recent uptick in the popularity of minimalism, there are many more people who understand that material goods do not equate to happiness or fulfillment. I know many people who seemingly have everything yet they can't get through a day with a couple of drinks or a Xanax while others I know who would be considered below the poverty level are very happy and content with their lives.6) You need a good job. Actually that has been the mantra for at least the last four generations of my family (before that people were self employed as farmers or small business owners). Since the industrial age began, people have moved towards the career job/stable salary tract and have forgot that it is perfectly acceptable to be your own boss. I have been my own boss for the last ten years and love it. I do, however, need to focus more on diversifying my client base. It is easy to get lazy when you have one client that pays really well and a couple of related clients which you just kind of fall in with. Starting next week, this diversification will be my main task as I work to rebuild/remake my business into something that works better for me.7) You need to be responsible and do the right thing. This usually entails following the crowd and doing what everyone else is doing. I have been responsible and \"doing the right thing\" for ages and all it has done for me was get me into a rut and make me bored silly. I am going to start doing what I want to do and screw what everyone else thinks. If I want to paint my new bedroom purple with pink polka dots I will, and I won't even care that it isn't something an adult would do. I am also going to finish my novel, enter off the wall contests, maybe even sing on a street corner for kicks....anything to make life more interesting and exciting.8) You need to be part of a community. I have been a bit overwhelmed with social/community organization responsibilities for the past decade. If something interests me, I tend to say yes and volunteer for things to the point that these sidelines become more like a secondary job. Part of the attraction to moving and settling somewhere totally new is that I won't have a half dozen board meetings to go to each week, I won't be responsible for moving organizations forward (ie: doing fund raisers, volunteering for projects, etc), and people won't be calling me for every crisis. It is great to volunteer and help out in the community but by trying to help everyone you actually do yourself a dis-service.9) You need great credit. I will be perfectly happy when, like Dave Ramsey, my credit report becomes unavailable because I will have no credit track record. His credit score is zero because he never uses credit and one day, I would like mine to be zero as well. But, like Dave Ramsey, I will of course have lots of money in the bank so that I can pay cash for anything I need (he pointed out at his recent event in Atlanta that while he would be unable to rent an apartment that required a credit check because he has no credit score, he could easily write a check and buy the entire building. I think that's cool!).10) There are lots of things that we have in mind to do during our lifetime but we often put them off in order to tend to our responsibilities. As a recant event showed me, you can be perfectly healthy one minute then drop dead the next so we should never put off doing anything. If you have always wanted to visit Washington DC, you should go now, even if it means CaigsListing a ride and CouchSurfing in order to do it...there may be no tomorrow."},
{"title": "As Our Vacation Winds Down: An Update", "date": "Tuesday, November 2, 2010", "text": "We have less than a week to go before the end of our vacation and we end up back in cold, rainy Washington. Here's what's happening of late (some money lessons included):I have been pondering the idea of what I will do with my job (or what it will do with me) when I get back next week. I have decided that I will terminate my contract with the business that I work for, therefore ending my eight year term with them. I love the work but with all kinds of upheaval going on and with the person I used to report to being replaced with two people that I literally can't stand being in the same room with, I think this is best for all. My business mentor/really good friend agrees whole heartedly with me, saying that the environment is so toxic there she can't believe I would even consider staying. Hubby was less enthusiastic but supportive nonetheless, and my conscience seems to think this is the best course of action for me even though it seems pretty crazy to leave a job, any job, during one of the worst times for unemployment in recent history. I am hoping that the universe will consider my actions brave and present me with some wonderful opportunities. Real life intervened in our pretty much idyllic vacation a couple of days ago when my SIL's receptionist had a severe aneurysm and nearly died. She is still in a coma in the hospital and while I didn't know her very well, she seemed very nice (and very young and healthy at about 45 years old!) so it was really a shock for everyone. Lots of money lessons came to mind including how her family will be able to make due without her income, how her family has so many additional expenses (hotel by the hospital, gas to get back and forth from home to the hospital a couple hours away, food, etc) that they weren't expecting, who will take care of her four children, whether or not she has health/disability insurance, etc. You never really think about these things until a big, tragic event suddenly happens and people are left to sort out the details. I guess I should really start planning what I/the hubby would do if such a thing happened to one of us. Our expenses have gone up. The first part of our vacation was spent vegging out at one SIL's home. We didn't do much and we had few expenses as the SIL treated us to nearly everything (dinners out, shopping, etc). The next part of our vacation took place on a cruise ship so all expenses (lodging, food, entertainment, etc) were paid in advance with the cost of the cruise. During the actual cruise we may have spent $75 total. Now that we are in New England with more than 50 family members and friends, our costs have risen because people take turn treating each other to meals out, we pay for gas to get around the city and go to other states to do tourist stuff, we have lots of nieces and nephews around so we tend to treat them (like skating a few days ago), we are doing some cooking at home but buying food, especially meat, in bulk can get spendy...you get the idea. We've had an interesting insight into how \"the rich\" live. We, like most of the family, do OK but some of the family that have come in from LA, Manila, and Hong Kong are decided wealthy. And it is interesting to watch how they do things. One cousin was talking to a friend and told him that he should come over for dinner with the family. So the guy did. He showed up about five hours later, after having hopped on a plane and flown in from Chicago. Now when I make dinner reservations, they usually include a short drive to the nearest city, not a plane ride half way across the country at a moment's notice. Another cousin literally doesn't know how to use a vacuum cleaner or wash dishes. She has a full staff that does every thing for her--her maids even wrapped a huge suitcase of gifts that she doled out to everyone and packed her suitcases! She is very nice but a bit odd. She avoids light in general, especially the sun but even direct light from light fixtures lest her porcelain skin get any sort of tan. She is very charming and we find her eccentric and amusing. I have decided that this is how I want to live. Much more travel, much less worry about mundane stuff like home repairs, who's doing what at work, what TV shows are going to be on, etc. Some people crave stability and a home. I have had that and it seems like I get so caught up in \"normal\" stuff that I miss life. I like a life that includes meeting new and interesting people, living on the spur of the moment (the family saying is that if you don't like the day's plans, just wait a few minutes because they will change), and enjoying new experiences (we've had so many over the last month that I've lost count!). Now, the challenges are many. How do we disconnect from the life we have had for 20 years? How do I cut loose from a job that provides a good income (I guess I will see in a week or so) as well as from my many community obligations? How do we generate an income and where will we live? Will we miss having a stable but boring existence? Can we travel yet settle down for a few months at a time so we can have the best of both worlds? I guess these things remain to be seen."},

Here's some things I have learned about minimalism during our travels:It is perfectly easy, and probably much cheaper, to buy stuff as you go along instead of \"stockpiling\" a garage full of \"good deals\". I always thought that I had to stockpile the stuff we use so that we would never run out and so that we could save money on the overall price of the items we buy. I much prefer just buying minimal quantities of items that we use as we have been doing throughout our travels. If the bar of soap is getting small, we buy one more bar of soap. It may cost a few pennies more than buying it on sale but there is less stuff to drag around with you, store, keep track of, etc. Here's an article that explains this theory in detail. I don't need five fleece jackets. Actually I bought one fleece jacket in Atlanta because I knew it would be cold by the time we got to Connecticut. But when I got to Connecticut, I didn't like the way the jacket fit so when I was shopping, I found another fleece jacket that I liked more. Instead of just adding the first jacket to the pile of stuff that I bought, wore once, then didn't wear again but can't seem to part with because I spent my hard earned cash on it, I gave jacket number one to my sister in law. Usually at home, I will buy multiples of one item (a dozen pair of jeans that are the same color but slightly different in design, a shirt that I like so I will by it in multiple colors, etc) but during our travels I have learned that I only need one really good version of each item I own. I need one pair of tennis shoes not eight, I need one super cool scarf, not a whole drawer full of them. And then when I want something new, I need to get rid of the item I already have to make room for the new item. I think this will be my goal from now on.I can shop at Walmart. Actually I do shop at Walmart for household items but never for clothes or shoes. A family member had a birthday party with a '50s theme and since I didn't want to spend much cash on my costume, I decided to go to Walmart, get something cheap to wear once, then give it away. Instead, I picked up a pair of Converse-looking tennis shoes and I have been wearing them every since I bought them! So I guess the moral of this story is that when you are a minimalist, a whole bunch of new learning opportunities can open for you.I don't need much stuff to survive. I need a clean, warm, safe place to stay. It needn't be big, expensive, or fancy. I need a couple of changes of clothes. I need basic toiletries. I need laundry facilities, my computer, and my cell phone. That's about it. I have been living with this small list of items for the last month and have been very happy with such a minimal amount of stuff. I saw this blog post from Evan and couldn't agree more. P.S. Our house is going back on the market the minute we get home!People seem to be happier to have us around than to get the random phone call or gift from us on occasion. People seem to give stuff because they are so busy working to earn money that they don't have time to give of themselves to others. I want to change our lifestyle so that I have more time to give to people rather than working my ass off to earn money to pay for stuff to give them.Perhaps the main thing that changed me from a consumerist to a minimalist was being stuck on the ship for twelve days with only the E! channel on TV. I'd really never watched the E! channel before and I can safely say I would never want to watch it again. Apparently the E! stands for excess. It also seems to promote envy, jealousy, drama, pride, and all of those other items enumerated as \"must not do's\" in the Bible. It was probably the most horrible array of consumerist behaviours I had ever witnessed and I would never want to be like any of the people who whose every stupid thought was fodder for TV viewers. There is nothing wrong with wanting to look good but the way in which these people express themselves, treat others, speak to others, and crown themselves as the Most Important Person in the Universe worthy of adulation for really no reason at all is just disgusting. Ick.So from now on I'm a minimalist and proud of it."},
{"title": "A Bundle of Home Remedies", "date": "Tuesday, October 26, 2010", "text": "I am firmly of the mind that you should exhaust all home remedies before seeing a doctor (disclaimer: I am not a doctor and if you are having serious symptoms, by all means call 911!). p.s.  I learned many of these tricks from my grandmother who didn't see a doctor for 50+years (the time between having her last baby and breaking her arm when she was around 75 years old).For digestion problems, take an acidophilous pill (found in the vitamin aisle, it replenishes the bacteria in your stomach that helps you digest food; these little bugs can be wiped out by antibiotics, stress, foreign bugs, etc).For constipation, drink a lot of water, eat rolled oats (the long cooking ones, not the instant ones), and exercise vigorously (like take a brisk walk for an hour).  Repeat.If you are cold at night (grandma didn't have central heating in her home, just a wood stove in the living room and kitchen), put a pillow over your feet while you sleep.If you are tired, take a nap instead of jolting yourself with caffeine.Take vitamin B12 for a couple of days in advance of heading out comping, it will help ward off mosquitoes.If you get sunburned, cover the burned area with Noxzema.  Grand dad used to put vinegar on sunburns but I think Noxzema works better.Take a multi vitamin every day.If you feel a cold coming on, double up on the vitamin C until it passes.If you are sick, stay in bed in a cool room with a bunch of blankets over you until you feel better (this works well for me and I usually kick any kind of malady in a day or two).Tea tree oil works great to disinfect scrapes, abrasions, and other potential infection sites.If you feel a urinary tract infection coming on, drink quantities of cranberry juice mixed with water.Don't take antibiotics unless you have a BACTERIAL infection that hasn't resolved after a bit of time.Your basic germs are actually good for you, they help boost your immune system.Make sure your vaccinations are up to date.Don't eat heavy meals except on Thanksgiving and Christmas.Do a headstand/handstand each day.  For some reason, the body likes to be inverted.Remind yourself to stand up straight (I heard this about a million times from grandma), it makes you look better and it is better for your skeleton and internal organs.Congestion or sore throat?  Drink tea and/or soup broth.Blood problems?  Boil beef bones and drink the broth.Fast for a day every once in a while.Don't lay down/sit down after eating.  Take a walk first.  If you must lay down (ie: you are ill), lay on your left side.If you are constantly chewing on ice, it may be a sign that you have low blood iron levels; a doctor can diagnose this definitively."},
{"title": "10 Ways to Give Back to Others When You are a Minimalist", "date": "Monday, October 25, 2010", "text": "We are still traveling for a couple of more weeks so at this point, I consider us extreme minimalists since all we have is what fits into our one carry-on bag each.  I like giving to others as much as possible but when you have hardly anything (including no extra stuff to give away since we are traveling so light, and no money to give since it looks like I won't have a job when we get back in a couple of weeks), it may seem impossible to be a giver.  Here's ten ways I have found to \"give back\" even though I don't really have anything material to give:Give what has been given to you.  In our travels we have acquired stuff--everything from apples each day from the ship's buffet to a nice, but too big, Coach purse from my sister in law, to two packets of Chicklets gum as change in a store in Cozumel, to gift cards for a couple of restaurants from a friend we met up with.  The thing is, we had no need of these things so I was able to pass these items on to others.  We would take the apples into the port cites each day and give them to kids and others who thought they were a huge treat (apples don't grow in the tropics and are therefore pretty expensive), I took the purse from the SIL which was too big to fit into my bag and gave it to a friend who absolutely loved it, gave the packets of gum to two men who were standing on a street corner, and gave the restaurant gift cards to another friend because after twelve days on the cruise, the last thing I wanted to do was see more food!Give assistance with projects.  When we get to Connecticut each year, the family always has a list of projects for us to do.  In fact, this afternoon, we are putting together another sister in law's new TV/surround system for her.  The great thing about this is that all it requires is a bit of physical effort.  We have also helped friends/family members with cleaning projects, yard projects, work projects, and moving projects.Cook for others.  We certainly don't have enough money to take the entire clan out for dinner at an expensive restaurant but the hubby is an excellent cook (and I am his excellent assistant).  Everyone seems to appreciate a good home cooked meal or homemade baked goods and all we had to pay for were the basic components of the meal which is much cheaper than going to a restaurant.Give of your expertise.  Another sister in law is a dentist so I have made my appointment with her to get my teeth cleaned at no charge (thanks sis!).  Hubby has a huge family and each person has certain areas of expertise--one person is a landscaper, one is a karate school teacher, one likes to do long distance driving, one works at an appliance store where he can get the family excellent discounts, one is a stay at home mom who will always babysit on a moment's notice--you get the idea--and I always help out with website design and my business expertise.  When we share our expertise with each other at no charge, we are giving back in a way that doesn't cost us out of our own pocket but provides a great benefit to others.Give your time.  Sometimes we do stuff that saves other people time.  Since we are on vacation and don't have a pressing schedule, we are the designated drivers to pick up others from the airport, we have taken cars for their appointments at the shop, picked up balloons and decorations for a party, dropped off dry cleaning, picked a kid up from school, and did other errands that saved other people time and effort and which didn't cost us anything besides our time. Being personable is another way to give to others.  Sometimes all someone wants is for another person to keep them company, be cheerful to be around, take an interest in them, and be kind to them.  All of these things don't cost you a penny but can make a positive difference in others' lives.  Note that this is especially true if you have grand kids who would love your attention or elderly friends and relatives who would similarly be happy to just have your presence.Look for opportunities to help others.  If you know of a friend who is looking for a particular kind of job and you happen to see an ad for just such a job, pass it along to them.  If your mother simply adores cats and you come across a funny cat picture, you can email it to her and brighten her day.  Passing along useful or entertaining information is a great (free) way to help others.Create something for others.  If you can turn a skein of yarn into a beautiful sweater for someone, you can give someone a gift that costs very little but is worth much more.  If you can whittle a piece of wood into a beautiful ornament for someone, that too is a gift that requires very little outlay of cash but creates a beautiful keepsake for someone who will appreciate both your efforts and skill.Notice when others need help and lend a hand.  This can be anything from holding open a door for someone who has their hands full to saving the life of a person who is drowning.  Often people won't specifically ask for help but if you see an opportunity to help out, why not do it without being asked?Teach someone something they don't know.  Whether you are volunteering to teach English to new immigrants or you bring a friend to an India Festival so they can have their first taste of curry, expanding others' horizons can go far in providing a useful way to give at little or no cost.I have a handful of friends who are basically vagabonds.  Most of them travel often and have very little in the way of money or material possessions but all of them are well loved by their friends and family because they do many of the things listed above.  It doesn't take money or stuff to actually give to others when you can give of your awesome self!"},
{"title": "Why We Are the  Cheapest Cruisers on the High Seas", "date": "Sunday, October 24, 2010", "text": "The hubby and I like to take cruises and usually go at least once a year. The price for cruises used to be all inclusive but these days, they seem to be in a \"race to the bottom\" much like airlines. They tend to charge as little as possible for the cruise itself and then offer an array of add-ons that would make an infomercial pale in comparison.Last week, we were surprised to see mini bars have been added to the cabins, just like they have in hotel rooms. The odd thing is that alcohol (for a price of course) is available at a dozen places on the ship and you can even have room service deliver it to your cabin so I guess they are going for the impulse purchase? Other things we have noticed over the years include the addition of \"premium\" restaurants where you need to pay a price to eat there. Before, all food service on the ship was included in the price you pay for the cruise, but now more than half of the restaurants require an extra fee. Drinks are hustled in every possible venue (and they are super expensive), a half dozen stations on the TV in our cabin were devoted to trying to sell us something, they lean heavily on daily (for pay) bingo games and raffles and continually hawk shore excursions, the ship's stores are open 24 hours a day for your shopping pleasure, and kiosk vendors are all over the ship selling everything from bathing suits to gold to watches. Photographers are also everywhere taking your picture in the hopes you will buy them. The sauna, steam room, and indoor hot tub used to be free, now there is a \"premium price\" charged to enter the \"spa\". Even activities on the ship now often carry a price tag. Want a tour of the ship? Pay up! It's definitely getting more dreary to cruise, however a ship is the only way to easily reach many of the islands we want to visit so we continue to cruise. Here's how we do it cheaply:I like an ocean view room. An inside cabin is like being inside a coffin so I found that at least with a view of the ocean or port outside my window I feel less claustrophobic. When I book, however, I choose the \"obstructed view\" for a lower price. I don't care if there is a lifeboat hanging outside my window as long as I can see daylight and a bit of ocean.Hubby and I don't drink so that saves us a ton of money on alcohol. It is always rather amusing to see the faces of people who have been drinking excessively all week get their final bill the night before the cruise is finished--some look like they are going to faint!We also rarely drink soda. Cruise ships charge a weekly fee for unlimited soda pop which can be $50 or more! What we do is buy a couple small bottles of soda when we go into port and bring it back to the ship with us.I love having an internet connection but the usual shipboard cost of $100 for 250 minutes is ridiculous. What I do instead is wait to get online when we go into ports. There are always internet cafes around and they usually charge about a dollar an hour.We also skip the ship stores for anything we need/have forgotten and instead purchase the items when we get into port at local stores and for much lower prices. We travel with one carry on bag each. Even for our recent 12 day cruise, we were able to bring enough clothes (think layers and multi-purpose items) to last the entire cruise. This saves us the added fee of checking bags when we fly to and from our departure port.I was shocked to find that the ship now charges for cappuccinos which have always been free. Hubby likes a cappuccino at least once a day so we figured out how to make our own. Coffee is free and half and half is free so I get a glass of ice, pour in half a cup of cooled coffee and fill the rest up with half and half and he ends up with a free, tasty, iced cappuccino.I have always thought that the price for laundry service on the ship is ridiculous at $25 for a small bag. Instead, about mid cruise, we pack up our dirty laundry and head out into the port town in search of a laundromat where we wash our own clothes for a fraction of the ship's laundry price with the added bonus that we get to interact with the locals which has always been a great experience.We also don't do tours and excursions offered by the cruise company. We have to laugh each time we see the \"explore the port city\" tour group from the ship. Each person has paid about $50 for the tour, but we are doing the exact same thing for free. Just get off the ship and walk into the city and explore it on your own! If there is something we want to see/do, we go just like the locals would. This may include taking a taxi or hiring a driver or paying an entrance fee but these costs are minimal in comparison to what the excursion companies charge. There are plenty of local companies that offer snorkeling gear rental, cave tours, etc, all you have to do is look or ask the locals.We don't eat in the premium restaurants. The food is great in the (free) dining rooms and buffets and it is the exact same food and exact same cooks as in the premium places. We get lots of information from the crew. We tend to quickly make friends with the room staff and the dining room staff so when we want to know how to do something cheaply, we ask them as they don't have much money but they still like to go shopping, get manicures, go to restaurants on shore, etc. On the last cruise, our waiter gave us lots of good info. He recommended buying food in the market then going to the kitchens behind the market where they will cook your food for next to nothing. He also recommended a place that charged $5 for manicures as opposed to the $15 nail shops in the tourist areas were charging.We tend to take free transportation in ports (which means walking) to explore the towns and cities we go to. If we want to go somewhere further or just want to go somewhere and it doesn't matter where, we will hop on a city bus, just like the locals. We don't need a private motor coach or even a taxi to go most places.We don't buy souvenirs. Our refrigerator is about ready to tip over with the weight of the many magnets we have collected from our travels over the years. We have found that traveling with one bag helps with this as we don't actually have room to collect stuff that we really don't need.Buying photographs on the ship is also expensive. When we want photos, we go to our local Walmart and get a package of 36 photos for around $10 which is a huge savings over the cost of photos sold on the ship.Finally, hubby likes his poker but their casino charges an arm and a leg for the privilege of gambling. Usually, casinos get a \"rake\" or fee of about a dollar or two per hand of poker but on the ship they charge a rake of 10%--the casino can make over $50 on one hand of poker! Again, ridiculous. So he simply doesn't gamble on cruise ships.There are still lots of ways to have fun on a cruise without spending a lot of money, or, as we did on the last cruise, without spending any extra money at all. Aside from an added fee of $12 per day to tip the staff which is billed the last day of our cruise, we actually didn't spend anything extra on the last cruise. Of course, this fee is negotiable and you can adjust it up or down but we have always found that the crew is great and well deserves this money so we don't quibble about it. What we did enjoy was free stuff which is listed in the daily newsletters like movies in the cinema, dancing each night, nightly Broadway-type shows, sitting on the deck and getting some sun, watching some great music acts, attending a couple of free educational classes, and of course going into each port stop. Cruises can be as cheap or expensive as you want to make them. We chose to make them as cheap as possible!"},
{"title": "Goal #4 Completed--Go to Connecticut", "date": "Saturday, October 23, 2010", "text": "After our cruise we flew up to Connecticut to visit family (three birthday parties are planned for this week alone here!). This completes goal #4 on my goal list.We wanted to work in a trip to Connecticut sometime this year which is why I put it on my goal list and it just so happened that it worked out that we could come here after our cruise so here we are. And, as part of the goal, hubby is playing a satellite tournament for the World Poker Tour at Foxwoods Casino in Ledyard, CT as I type this (I have a favorite spot between Foxwoods and MGM where I can plug in my netbook, get free wi fi, and eat Dunkin Donuts so I'm all set here while he plays).I love Connecticut in the fall. The trees are beautiful (we're going to Vermont in a few days so I can get some good leaf pictures), the weather is cool but still sunny, and the Italian food is to die for (ravioli and lots of tasty bread at Illiano's in New London this evening).I'm back and I missed my blogging friends!We just got back from a 12 day cruise to the Southern Caribbean on the NCL Dawn. This completes goal #5 on my goal list.We left New York and visited the Dominican Republic, Aruba, Curacao, Roatan, and Cozumel. Here's the highlights/comments from our trip:The average age of the cruisers was about 65. I think this is common on longer trips and trips during the off season when retires are more likely to travel.The cruisers also appeared to be about 20% gay. Which is fine except for a couple of them kept hitting on the hubby and I thought I would have to get in a girl fight a time or two. Also if I never hear the songs 'YMCA', 'It's Raining Men', 'Dancing Queen', and 'I Will Survive' again, I will be happy.And don't even get me started on men in Speedos. Ick.The best entertainment on the cruise was a duo called Fire and Ice. Usually cruise ship entertainment is OK at best but this lady does Tina Turner BETTER than Tina Turner. They put her in a small venue that was always standing room only and I have no idea why she isn't playing Vegas because she was sooo amazing. Here is a video I found of her on YouTube since I haven't uploaded my videos yet but the video doesn't even do her justice.The mostly Filipino crew were as always friendly and great. They are the most overworked, underpaid, and under appreciated people on the planet but I think they are wonderful!We visited: Dominican Republic (super poor but super nice people), Curacao (cute city), Aruba (the huge iguanas made me squeal and run), Roatan (poor but the kids there are so amazing), and Cozumel (way too commercial). Plus it was a beautiful 80+ degrees each day--love it!The \"all inclusive\" cruise of yesteryear is now anything but. It's kind of like a floating infomercial which is disappointing. My next post will detail how we are the cheapest cruisers the cruise lines have probably ever seen.Overall we had a good time, I got another 15,000 words written for my book, I got a tan, and I'm sure I gained a few pounds (it's the tasty, unlimited food that did me in), and it was great to be able to practice my Spanish in all of the countries we visited."},
{"title": "Leaving Atlanta", "date": "Saturday, October 9, 2010", "text": "Well, we're off to accomplish some more goals on the list, namely, a 12-day Caribbean cruise so you won't see any posts here for a couple of weeks.  As I get ready to leave Atlanta, here's some thoughts:I found out that we actually aren't in Atlanta.  We are north of Atlanta in one of the many yuppie suburbs in the area.I've never seen so many McMansions in my life as I have in this part of the world.They have a lot of golf courses here.And a lot of shopping.  I don't think this part of the country got the memo that we are in a recession because it seems like EVERYONE is out shopping and eating in expensive restaurants.They seem to have an equal number of bars and churches here (and lots of both!). HmmmThe earth here is red which I find really cool, our dirt is a boring brown.The food here is excellent.  I can totally see why this part of the country is the most overweight--the food is too good to resist.The weather is excellent here as well.  Back home it is a gloomy, rainy, 50 degrees, here it is a bright, sunny 80 degrees.  In October. Wow.I did absolutely nothing for the past ten days.  We are lodging in the guest wing of my sister in law's house.  We have this huge, beautiful space and no itinerary to do anything so we just enjoyed the time relaxing and doing very little of anything.  We did eat.  A lot.  Fitting into a bathing suit for the cruise just isn't going to happen...maybe a muu muu.I did do something, however.  I am 20,000 words into a novel I am writing.  I have always wanted to write a book and have it published so I figured why not now?  So I have been writing every day which has been cool and fun.I may have committed Business Suicide; RIP Me.  Actually the email I sent to the imploding organization that I do a ton of work for was meant to be helpful, however I don't know if it will be taken as such.  I wrote up the email, hit send, then put on my vacation email responder so I won't have to worry about answering any emails for two weeks.I think subconsciously starting the book was a reaction to the fact that I probably won't have a job when I get back home.Television is a huge time suck.  I realized this because I don't have much interest in the oddly arranged channels of the cable service provider here so I barely watched TV.  The result?  I had lots of time to write, and I realized how much time I waste watching TV.The people here are beautiful to look at.  I don't know why but they are.I got to see Dave Ramsey in person!Finally, I read this article and thought that this guy's life sounds like it totally rocks--I'm going to be a minimalist when I grow up.And finally, finally, I was looking around the internet and found that one of my favorite Korean dramas (subtitled in English) has finally been posted in it's entirety.  I will have a couple of weeks in New England after the cruise and plan to watch the entire thing then."},
{"title": "50 Resources If You are Flat Broke, Jobless, Homeless, Etc.", "date": "Thursday, October 7, 2010", "text": "This post has been updated in 2014 to include many more (and more updated) resources.  Find it here.I was thinking about writing this post, thinking about all of the many resources that are available for those in need, then thought maybe I would write about something else. Then, just as I was signing onto Blogger, I came across this article in my feed reader which inspired me to write about my original topic. Obviously I don't write as well as this guy or have his experience but these 50 resources may help (and note that the article was written in the 1970s but many of the resources are just as viable today...interesting!).If you or your spouse have served any time at all in the Armed Forces, check with your local VA service center to see what benefits you are entitled to.Our city has free meal sites all over town, each day of the week. Most places that help the homeless will have an updated list of these meal sites.The Salvation Army is great. They offer two meals each day (breakfast and lunch) and provide food to go, toiletries, and other things for those in need.Call 211--this is a national number which provides information on all of the social service resources available in your community.Sign up for food stamps if you qualify. Many do, even if they are working part time. It doesn't hurt to ask.Sign up for public housing or emergency housing if you qualify. Unfortunately, there is such a huge need for this service that many housing programs have years-long waiting lists.Sign up for welfare if you qualify. Generally this is for parents with children but there may be medical programs and other services that anyone with low/no income can qualify for.If you are a senior citizen, check out what services you qualify for (ie: Social Security, Medicare, etc).Take advantage of other senior deals (discounted national parks passes, discounted bus passes, discounted airline tickets, restaurant discounts, etc).Ditch the car and get a transit pass. These are often discounted for those with low/no income.Check out your local Goodwill--they have everything from free job training programs to low income assistance programs and good discount shopping in their stores as well.Dollar Stores are a great place to shop for everything from food to toiletries--just choose nutritious food instead of the super low-priced junk food.Thrift stores are another great place to shop. They usually have low prices but on certain days, they have sales and their low prices may be cut in half!Our local library is like Grand Central for the homeless. Not only does it provide shelter on cold, rainy days, but with a free library card, you get free books to read, free use of computers and internet, free music, free newspapers, free videos, etc.Dumpster diving is a tried and true way to find stuff you need. It pays to go with an experienced diver the first few times because they will know where the good dumpsters are, where to find the best food, which ones to stay away from, etc.College students should definitely check and see if their school has a homeless services office. Many schools are now aware that some of their students are homeless and they try to provide as many extra services as possible for these students, usually through a designated office or club.Check with your local health department. They generally offer everything from free vaccinations and basic medical tests to other services.Check with your local mental health services office. This is another organization that deals with a lot of homeless/low income people as mental health issues can often go hand in hand with reasons that people become homeless.If you are a member of a federally enrolled tribe, your tribal health clinic or tribal liaison office can help you sign up for the benefits you are entitled to.Free community events are a great place to score some free entertainment as well as get free stuff (vendors usually provide samples and free advertising stuff like t shirts at these events).Free food samples are always good. If you have a Costco or Sam's Club card, running around the food aisles a couple of times can practically provide a free meals just from the food samples.Many communities have programs that help you pay for your heat and utilities during the winter. Check with your local social services office about these programs or with your local utility office.Medical care can be super expensive. Free community medical clinics are a good first place to go. If you don't have one of those, a sliding scale clinic is the next step, and then maybe an urgent care. Emergency rooms of hospitals are required to provide you service in the event of an emergency (but be prepared for the huge bill you get in the mail afterwards...should this happen, ask about the hospital's charity care program).Look for opportunities. Like the guy in the article, he saw a need then filled it (selling cigarettes, selling photos). If you see a need, think about what you can do to fill the need and make a little money in the process.Crash weddings, parties, and meetings. The food at these events can range from minimal to awesome.Malls are another location to pick up free stuff on occasion. Our mall hosts various events throughout the year that feature free entertainment and free vendor samples. Additionally, our mall has a marketing research company which pays people for their opinions on consumer products. For about 10 minutes of my time I have often received $7--enough to pay for my frap at Starbucks.When it comes to getting a minimum wage job, find one with benefits, even if it is just at a restaurant where you get free meals (I lived off of free meals at restaurant jobs all through college).You could try dating. This probably only works well for women but a friend of mine has met so many dates online and they almost always meet her for coffee or take her out for dinner. I don't think she has paid for dinner in like a year.Look online for free stuff. Freecycle and CraigsList are great places to look for free stuff.Consider a trade. Trade your handyman or manager services for free apartment rent, or trade some work at a restaurant or venue when they have a big event for free meals. Living in as a babysitter or senior care taker is also a great way to secure housing by trading work.Get a monthly pass for the local gym or YMCA/YWCA if you are homeless, this is a great way to get a free shower every day.If you are involved in a domestic violence situation, call your local YWCA or DV shelter and find out about their free shelter programs and other services available to domestic violence victims.Do a good deed. Sometimes, doing something as simple as helping a stranger can result in an amazing payback.Get a PO Box. For a minimal annual fee, you will at least have a place to get your mail. For some things you need a street address, in this case you may want to check into getting a private mailbox.A prepaid cell phone (like Virgin Mobile's $25 per month plan) will at least keep you in touch with people and possible job prospects. Note that some phone companies offer highly discounted home and cell phones for low income people.Check with your local fire department for everything from free smoke detectors to free car seats for your kids, to free CPR classes, to free grab bars for the elderly. Not all fire departments offer these things but many in our area do.If you are homeless, find out where your severe weather shelters are; many of these places offer free overnight lodging for the homeless when he weather is severely cold.If you have been made homeless due to a declared disaster, FEMA's disaster assistance programs have a range of services that you can partake in.Homeless shelters are available in most cities; this is one option for shelter that some people take advantage of (others don't seem to like shelters so you would have to see for yourself if this is a good option for you).Many cities have specialized homeless youth service centers; this is an excellent option for those under 21 who are homeless.You could join the military. Once you are in, they literally take care of everything for you--housing, shelter, food, training, clothing, dental, etc.If you are facing eviction, some community service agencies can help with this. They can alert your to your rights in this situation, sometimes provide emergency cash assistance to pay back rent, and other times file for stays of eviction until further help can be provided.If you are in legal trouble, there are a number of free and low cost legal services available. Everything from free legal advice 1-800 numbers to free legal clinics, to \"do it yourself\" legal forms and classes, to community service programs to pay off tickets can be had by asking at your local courthouse.If drug and alcohol issues are the reason your find yourself in need, many communities offer in-patient and out-patient drug and alcohol treatment services.If you are recently jobless, check to see if you qualify for unemployment payments, job retraining program, or any other programs related to your being unemployed.College can be another great idea. Depending on your income, test scores, or grades, qualifying for grants and scholarships can give you a college education and housing. Beware student loans, however, which can saddle you with debt for decades.Consider an easy to set up online business to take in some cash. With so many free platforms for selling your stuff online, the possibilities are endless. One girl was reported to have sold her used underwear online and this raked in enough to pay for her entire college education (sounds icky but I guess there is a big market for this).Some cities have drop in centers which provide all kinds of services for the homeless from showers to a place to do their laundry to meals and assistance with securing other services.Consider hunting down your own food. Depending on the season, you can fish, hunt, forage for wild berries and fruit, find wild mushrooms, etc.Stand by the side of the road and hold a sign asking for money. Sounds tacky but this has nearly become a cottage industry in our area and I've heard that some people can take in more per hour doing this than getting a job (I wouldn't suggest this as a life-long career but if you are flat broke and desperate this may be an option)."},

{"title": "50 Ways to Get Free Stuff", "date": "Monday, October 4, 2010", "text": "We have had the opportunity in just a short few days to get many free things while we have been here in a new city which got me thinking about how many free things people can get on a regular basis if you just look around.  Here's some ideas:Dumpster dive.  You can come up with everything from food (I haven't tried this) to furniture and other items (I got a great desk this way).Free food samples at Costco (membership card sometimes required--or just walk in with another member).Many times people will leave stuff by the side of the road with a \"free\" sign on it.  Hubby found a mountain bike with just such a sign, cleaned it up, and sold it on CraigsList.  Yesterday, we saw people moving all of their stuff out of their house and when we went by in the evening, the leftover stuff was sitting by the curb with a big FREE sign on it.Community meetings often provide free snacks as an enticement for people to show up.Churches usually have free food of some sort after the service.Museums often have free entry nights.Community festivals often have free entry and free entertainment.  We were walking down the road in Dacula, GA yesterday and came upon a tiny community event which featured free entertainment (those young pageant girls could really sing!) and free demonstrations of old time farm life.Community transit systems, usually in larger cities, often have \"free ride\" areas.A glass of water is often free at restaurants (which will save you $2 to $4 off the cost of ordering a beverage).Coupons found in your local newspaper or online often get you free products.Complaining can get you a free product.  I have done this everywhere from Starbucks (my frap was practically melted before they gave it to me) to restaurants (my order was wrong or not cooked properly) to hotels (we were upgraded to a suite at the Palms in Vegas because we were disappointed with our room) and received wonderful free things (a great way for companies to keep their customers happy and coming back).If friends or family know you like hand-me-downs, you are more than likely to get lots of free clothing and other stuff from them.Vaccinations are given away free a couple of times a year through our local Health District office.Community events such as fairs, health fairs, and parades often have plenty of vendors who give away product samples (we have collected everything from condoms to T shirts to beverages to pens to Frisbees to mouse pads to bracelets to key chains and much more at these kinds of events).Free fire wood can be yours for the taking if you clean up downed trees (depending on the regulations of your area).Natural things to use for crafts can be found laying around on the ground (leaves, shells, sticks, etc).Some people enjoy wedding crashing, mainly for the free food and entertainment.Free software is available online (among my favorites: AVG, Open Office, and Onmi Format 995).Free personal websites can be had online at Blogger, FaceBook, etc.Free communication programs can also be found online at Skype and Chikka.Scholarships can provide free education for you--these can pay for everything from one class to an entire four-year degree.We've received a number of free items from utility companies (low flow shower heads, low flow faucets, etc).Our local fire department offers free CPR classes and free smoke detectors.Libraries offer a plethora of free stuff--everything from books, music, and movies to free internet and story time for the kids.I love free internet access.  More and more places are offering this valuable service for free.Free help from your friends.  We have friends who have provided us all kinds of free services (of course we return the favor), including fixing our car, towing a dead car, dental work, helping with building projects, etc.Free gambling.  Hubby likes to play poker but doesn't like spending much money on this so he plays for free online and, yesterday, he played some sort of a tournament at a bar with the guys and won a $30 voucher for food, yet he didn't have to spend anything to enter the game.Casinos often offer free beverages.Nightclubs sometimes offer free dance lessons and free entry before a certain time at night.Banks offer free checking and savings accounts.Send in a rave.  There has been more than a few times I have mailed a letter to a company telling them how great I thought their product was and received coupons for free items from them in the mail.Reality shows with great grand prizes are often free to enter, such as Amazing Race and Survivor.If you don't need the degree, you can \"attend\" free university classes online.Check your favorite restaurant for free promotions.  Famous Daves offers a free lunch to people named Dave once a year.  Baskin Robbins provides free ice cream cones once a year.  Other restaurants offer free food on a random basis.AM/FM radio is still free!Many community health events provide free medical testing for things such as diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol.  Some even offer free mammograms and PAP tests for women.Community parks and playgrounds are a great way to entertain the kids.Walking is a great free way to exercise.Some farmers open their fields free to gleaners after the main harvest is finished.Our county fair has a couple of free entry days and free activities for the kids.Window shopping is free, and so is trying on beautiful new clothes.  Just don't buy anything!Our local home improvement store has free lessons on Saturdays for adults and kids which teach you a variety of \"do it yourself\" skills.College campuses often have free activities going on.  Check the online student newspaper or the bulletin board for info.Our local military bases also have lots of free things going on, some just for those with base access but other events are open to the general public.Our local mall has a few annual events where there are lots of community vendors, food samples, and handouts, all free.Our community hosts \"music on the pier\" events each summer which provide a nice evening of entertainment that is totally free.If you like the outdoors, the US National Park Service offers free admission to the national parks a couple of times a year.Our county and state also offers \"free fishing\" days where you can go fishing without having to purchase a license which is usually required.Depending on where you live, camping can be a great free way to travel.  Just pull over to the side of the road and set up camp.Our county garbage dump has one free day a year when you can dump big things that usually cost a lot to get rid of, like refrigerators, couches, etc.I'm sure there is lots more free stuff to be had, depending on where you live.  As we are trying to contain costs as much as possible during this vacation, you can bet that anything with a \"free\" sign on it is going to get our attention!"},
{"title": "Be a Great House Guest, Reap the Benefit of Free Lodging", "date": "Sunday, October 3, 2010", "text": "The majority of our vacation will be spent as house guests of family and friends.  This is one of the best ways of saving a ton of money on lodging while at the same time, getting to spend time with people you haven't seen in a while and getting lots of insider info on the local area.  Here's some tips on how to be an awesome house guest:Pick people you are reasonably compatible with.  While we tend to get along with everyone, there are some families we simply wouldn't stay with.  Chaotic or messy houses, friends who have pets in the house (hubby is allergic), a certain cousin who tends to have one psychotic boyfriend after another (complete with creepy friends who come and go at all hours) are just not compatible with us so in those cases we will stay at a hotel.Clean up after yourself.  If you cook, clean up immediately, make your bed as soon as you wake up, if you use the clothes washer or dryer, remove your clothes as soon as they are finished...the basic rules that work for living well with roommates work for being a good house guest.Be \"low maintenance\" guests.  This is the type of guests we are and this is the type of guests we prefer to stay at our house.  People are super busy these days so you shouldn't expect them to take care of your every need or be at your disposal 24/7.  We generally meet up with our hosts for dinner but other than that, we are out and about exploring the city/shopping/taking part in other activities on our own.  We generally use public transportation or rent a car unless the host has an extra car that they don't use.Give back to your hosts.  Even though you are not paying for a room, it is a good idea to be as valuable as possible to your hosts.  When we travel, I tend to do \"businessy\" stuff for our hosts (everything from fixing computers to doing their taxes to helping them with their businesses, etc) while hubby will cook wonderful meals and do simple handyman projects around the house.  I actually think it is hubby's great cooking that keeps getting us invited back!Don't stay too long.  If you will be in a place for more than a week or so, try to line up a couple of places to stay.  If you've been in one place so long that you are more like a room mate than a house guest, you've been there too long.Replace anything you have used.  Our hosts will often leave shampoo or toothpaste out for us, but before we leave, we are sure to go to the local Walmart to replace these items.Offer to tag along if you won't be in the way.  This is an especially interesting way to get to know a new country.  I have went along with our hosts to: school, work, a hospital, a post office, a ritzy Polo Club (a friend was performing in a band at an event there), the grocery store, and numerous other places in foreign countries where I was introduced to the culture in ways that would have never happened for a regular tourist.When you leave, send your host a nice thank you note and mail/leave them a small gift.  This makes a nice final impression and they will remember you favorably the next time you come to town.Being a great house guest is pretty simple--being considerate, tidy, and helpful are qualities that not only help you in life, but can help you secure a free place to stay.  Just be sure to return the favor when your friends show up in your city."},
{"title": "Goal #21 Completed--Went to the Dave Ramsey Live Event", "date": "Saturday, October 2, 2010", "text": "And the goals keep getting checked off! Today I went to the Dave Ramsey Live event in Atlanta. This, by the way, was #21 on my goal list.I love Dave Ramsey! He is an amazing speaker and just as good in person as he is on the radio and TV. There were thousands of people there at the arena and I am happy to report that many of them were younger people--a hopeful thing to think that many young people, if they follow Dave's advice, won't have to go through years of financial drama like many of the boomers and post-boomers did because we were exposed to massive amounts of credit debt without the knowledge of how to deal responsibly with such things.Anyway, I had two tickets to the event and hubby decided at the last minute to go to the weekend poker game with the guys (he doesn't actually hate Dave, he just says he is tired of listening to him, yet when I overhear him talking to the kids, he practically quotes Dave verbatim on all things financial...go figure). So my sister in law decided to go with me even though she had never heard of Dave Ramsey. Some four hours later, I can't say she was exactly impressed with the show--she is fairly beyond needing financial advice because she has plenty of money and seems to manage it well--but at least she was paying attention and taking notes in the workbook. Her only comment after the show was that he was excessively loud. The crowd didn't seem to mind as it was practically a cheer-fest every time he said something. I just love Dave-isms such as \"your FICO score is your I love debt score.\" It seemed like most of the audience were already Dave fans as they cheered on cue and knew everything he was alluding to without requiring explanation.Overall this was a great event and I am even more determined to complete our debt snowball as quickly as possible so I can start to pay off the house ASAP!"},
{"title": "Goal #3 Completed--Visit Atlanta", "date": "Friday, October 1, 2010", "text": "Well, we're off on our big vacation.  Our first stop is Atlanta to visit my sister-in-law and to go to the Dave Ramsey Live Event which will take place tomorrow.  Fortunately, this stop allows me to get back to checking things off my goal list as well.Officially, goal #3, visit Atlanta, is completed even though the only thing we have seen so far is a restaurant, an amazing Asian grocery store, and Costco.  So far we have spent literally NOTHING on this trip.  The ride to the airport was free, we brought food with us to eat on the flight, beverages were free on the plane, the SIL treated us to a nice restaurant meal for dinner, and we are staying free of charge for ten days at the SIL's huge, beautiful home. The only \"culture shock\" so far has been shopping with hubby's sister who is fairly wealthy.  She wanted to pick up \"some\" food at Costco since she lives by herself and always eats out so didn't have any food at home (hubby likes to cook and she loves his cooking).  She literally NEVER looks at prices when she shops which is quite unusual for us.  We compare prices on EVERYTHING we buy, and if something is too expensive we just don't buy it.  She was throwing stuff in the cart left and right and didn't even notice that the steak was $10 a pound.  Hubby had this weird expression on his face both at the meat counter and at the checkout stand, since what she spent on one cart of groceries was more than we spend in two weeks.  Anyway, we are on vacation so we decided to just enjoy her generosity and try not to comment too much.Meanwhile, when she is at work in the city, we have a long list of free things to do in Atlanta garnered from the internet which should keep us more than busy during our stay, and even though we have a car at our disposal, we will probably just get public transit passes as this is the easiest way we have found to navigate cities when we travel (plus we don't have to worry about getting lost, parking, etc)."},
{"title": "My First Attempt at Living Poor...Err...Frugally", "date": "Saturday, September 25, 2010", "text": "My job is still in limbo, so with the looming possibility of my very nice income becoming a teeny tiny income, it suddenly hit me that while I have been pretty careful with my money in the past in order to pay off debt, I really haven't been as frugal as I could or should have been. I could end up (hopefully temporarily) \"poor\" in which case I really will need to change my lifestyle. So I thought I would start today--both for practice and for the eventual possibility that these change I make really will be necessary.With everything I did today, I asked myself, \"if I was flat-broke poor, what would I do in this situation?\" And here's what I did:--Got up this morning and made tea at home as well as breakfast (an apple and fried eggs). Sometimes I eat breakfast at home but often I skip it which makes me hungry when I'm out and about which causes me to buy stuff, either at a restaurant or store, because I'm hungry.--Took all of my vitamins. I have been slacking off on this but I really need to keep myself as healthy as possible.--Went to my favorite place, Barnes and Noble, and hung out for a while. If I really would have had no money I would have had to skip the Starbucks there all together but for today I settled for a $2 Italian Soda instead of my regular $4 frap. Reading there was free.--Took the bus to Barnes and Noble then hopped on another bus ($2 total for both bus trips) to meet hubby at the casino where we had lunch (free) and where he won (he left with $10 more than he started with). I also had a hot chocolate while I waited for him (beverages are free at the casino). Note that hubby has a \"casino allowance\" of $100 per month and while I basically think that gambling is a huge waste of money, it's his hobby and his social life and he never spends more than his budgeted $100 and he often is able to pay his bills with his winning each month.--Went to Les Schwab to get the tires on the car rotated (free, I love Les Schwab!) and grabbed a bag of popcorn while we were waiting (free).--Stood outside for a bit and enjoyed the wonderful warm, breezy fall weather (free...and quite enjoyable).--Stopped by the store to get a bit of fruit to tide me over until we leave next week on vacation ($1.24 for two bananas and three apples). We have spent very little on food these past couple of weeks because we are trying to eat everything perishable before we leave so we don't have to throw it away.--Mowed the yard. Not my favorite thing to do but it saves the cost of the gardener and gets me some exercise and sunshine as well. I think this will be the last time we will have to mow this year (I hope!).--Made dinner at home (we're down to making tuna macaroni and cheese because we have hardly anything left in the fridge). This was an oddly satisfying meal as we rarely eat such simple food and it tasted pretty good.--Baked oatmeal raisin cookies. While I was at the grocery store today, the snack aisle was calling to me but I resisted. From now on, I'm making my own snacks at home.--Flossed my teeth. Again this is something I often slack on but I really do need to pay more attention to my overall health.--Hubby \"practiced\" packing for our trip and was able to squish everything into one carry-on bag. Hooray for hubby! I always travel with one carry on but he has a hard time not taking a ton of clothes and shoes with him when we travel. He thought it would be impossible to travel for a month and a half with only what he can bring in a carry on bag but it looks like this might just work out (and save us $100!).Overall a pretty simple day but these were important lessons nonetheless. I think whether by choice or circumstance, more and more people are having to live like this. It's all in the attitude, however, which my grandmother taught me so many years ago. They never had a lot of money but my grandparents always had cash on hand simply because they didn't spend unless it was absolutly necessary--certainly not daily like I spend--and they did most everything for themselves. I remember one time my grandmother told me that if she was able to pick up a pair of socks at the dime store, she was happy; she didn't need to buy a whole shopping bag of clothes in order to feel good about herself. Grandma was eternally optimistic and was always happy no matter what her situation. I need to be more like that. I will never be poor but, rather, frugal by choice."},
{"title": "I Think I'm Losing My Job...Shouldn't I Be In a Panic By Now?", "date": "Tuesday, September 21, 2010", "text": "Even though I am self employed, my biggest client (you know, the one that pays my mortgage and all of my other bills) looks like it will be going toes up within the next week.  I do have a handful of other clients that I make small amounts from each month and a few others that call me up occasionally for random projects, but this particular client has given me a ton of work over nearly the past decade so this is where I have focused most of my time and energy.  (Note to self, don't put all of your financial eggs in one basket!).So anyway, I was at a meeting yesterday with said client when she got a call and then left in a hurry.  Fast forward a couple of hours when she called to say that her Board of Directors had put her on administrative leave and it didn't look like she would have a job by next week.  Since my contracts go through this particular lady, there is a slight possibility that the company will continue with my contract but a really big possibility that they won't.  I feel like I should be panicking right now but for some reason I am not.  Here's my take on the situation:We have our vacation already planned and paid for.  We will be leaving next week and won't be back until mid November.  It seems insane to leave when everything is up in the air but on the other hand, everything is paid for (airline tickets and cruise) and when we aren't on the cruise, we will be staying with family so our expenses will be minimal.  We also incur zero expenses while we are on cruises since we don't drink, go to the fancy restaurants, go to the spa, etc.  We decided to just go on vacation no matter what happens because everything is paid for, because a month plus of no work will give me lots of time to focus on other projects that could turn into new business for me, and because a change of scenery may provide for more/different opportunities for us.I still have a mortgage payment to pay and some tax debt but fortunately, the huge list of debts I had just a year ago have been mostly paid off.  If not for that, I really would be panicking about how to pay my bills should I end up without this lucrative contract job.Unfortunately since I am self employed, I won't be entitled to unemployment.  Bummer.  However, since I have worked as a contractor with this company for nearly a decade, I will certainly wrangle with the Board for a significant bonus of some sort if I do leave.I have been doing this sort of work for nearly 15 years.  I like it, I am good at it, but I certainly don't love it.  This may be just the shove from the universe that I need to follow my bliss and find work that I absolutely love to do.If we needed to, we could sell our house and move to a smaller/cheaper place.  We would have to sell for less than the amount we want due to the current home values in our area, but at least we would make a profit because we have a good amount of equity in our home.I have a good husband that will support me no matter what I do.  Although he is retired and has a set pension/income which pays our household bills so there isn't extra to pay ALL of the bills, moral support from him is a super good thing to have.I am, in an odd way, kind of looking forward to living minimally.  We've had our big house, and our nice lifestyle for years and years but now that the kids have all grown up and moved out, I have often thought, \"what's the use of supporting this lifestyle?\"  I think I would be much happier with a smaller home, a smaller income, and lots more time to enjoy simple things like going to the library, hanging out with friends, doing yoga each morning instead of running out of the house to meetings, and having time to cook really simple, yet really good meals.We may be \"forced\" to move overseas.  We have toyed with this idea for a few years but it has always come down to what would we do with the house and how could I leave such a good job.  This may be another push from the universe to try something new and we could easily live on just hubby's pension in his home country in southeast Asia.So I guess, oddly enough, I am looking at this drastic situation as more of an opportunity for an exciting change than as a threat to our current lifestyle.  I hope it pans out as such."},

{"title": "65 Ways to Simplify Your Life", "date": "Thursday, September 16, 2010", "text": "Time and again, I notice that when I simplify my life, it has the side affect of also saving me money (and usually stress too!). Here's 65 ways to do just that:Start your morning off my making coffee or tea at home...no parking/waiting at the drive through, no waiting to order, no finding change in your purse, no getting the wrong order...you get the idea.Make your breakfast choices simple: fruit, yogurt, eggs, oatmeal...nothing fancy, just a nourishing start to your day.If you can't list your day's meetings/activities in a small calendar book, you are too busy! Cut back on your obligations.Simplify your wardrobe...both the number of pieces you own and the color assortment of your clothing, it will make getting dressed in the morning faster and easier.Pay your bills online. Once you have done this a few times, it becomes quite quick and easy.Pick one or two hobbies/volunteer positions/activities and do them really well instead of spreading yourself too thin and trying to do a dozen different things.Clear your desk and only put back the things that you absolutely need...clear workspace, clear mind!Write down a \"to do\" list of the five things you absolutely must do the next day...no writing down 50 things that will stress you out and that you won't be able to complete anyway.De-clutter your home. Make it as spartan and a third world orphanage. No clutter, no knick knacks, no junk, etc.Make your bedroom an oasis of tranquility--a bed and maybe a plant and that's it (no computer, no desk, no TV!).Go for quality--in your spartan bedroom, have 500 thread count sheets on the bed along with a down comforter that makes you feel like you are sleeping in a cloud.Clear out your bathtub. A friend has no less than 20 hair/body products lining her bathtub. It makes me stressed just looking at it! Pick a couple of quality shampoos and an olive oil soap and maybe a nice conditioner and that's it.Clean out your fridge every week and minimize there as well. If a food is just lingering there and not being eaten, toss it out rather than looking at it every time you open the door.Recycle as much as possible.Move closer to your job so you can walk or bike to work.Take the bus! You can't do 25 energy-draining and time-wasting errands when you are at the mercy of the bus schedule so cut down the number of places you need to go, hop on the bus, and relax.Instead of printing out everything on your computer printer that you think you may need in the future, save the info on your computer and keep a digital copy instead of a paper copy.Scan all of your important documents into your computer. When you need this info, it is easier to search you computer instead of running to the safe deposit box.Back up your files weekly (the stress-saving value of this simple thing alone will save you when your computer goes toes up).Consolidate! If you have eight email address, shift down to two. If you have six social networking sites, determine to only update one or two.Be \"in the moment\". If you are exercising, focus on your body and your exercise, not on your \"to do\" list or the big presentation at work.Read a book instead of being tethered to your computer or Kindle.Build family unity by working together: wash the car together instead of running it through the car wash, do yard work together instead of hiring it done, etc.Make up a fairly comprehensive first aid kit so you don't have to run to the store for provisions every time someone gets a sniffle.Make templates for things you need to do often (ie: a grocery shopping list, meeting agenda templates, etc).Don't use shopping for entertainment...it is expensive and it doesn't provide any educational/inspirational experience.Put your cell phone away when you get home. Unless you are waiting for a kidney, you don't need to be available 24/7.Have a garage sale, and sell more stuff than you usually would. When we were preparing to move we sold lots of stuff including furniture. We didn't end up moving and we didn't want to buy furniture to replace the stuff we sold, so we ended up with a more open, less cluttered home. Now we can throw a dance in the family room because we have no furniture in there, only rugs and huge pillows...simple.Make meal time a relaxing experience at home instead of a sprint through the drive through.Set aside work time, where you actually work. This is easier to do if you are self employed. I find that I can hammer away at work in four hour blocks and get lots more done than if I set an eight hour block of time to work where I get distracted with internet surfing, TV watching, calling friends, etc.Become a one car family. You pay less in insurance, you only take one car for service instead of two or three, you only wash one car instead of two or three, etc.Exercise simply. Walking, biking, and playing with the kids at the playground are free ways to exercise and much less stressful than waiting for a piece of equipment to become available at the gym.Wear sensible shoes. They are better for your feet, better for your posture, and better for taking the unexpected hike through the woods.Live in a smaller place. The time to clean a smaller place alone will save you untold hours of your life. Decorating and maintenance costs go down exponentially as well.Take simple vacations. Visit the family or go camping instead of going to Disneyland or Vegas...these places are much more stressful and cost lots more too.Focus on one thing at a time. When you are playing with your kids, don't be answering your phone, when you are working on a project, don't be tempted to surf the net or update your FaceBook status.Figure out how to use diet and exercise to cure \"lifestyle diseases\" such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol instead of taking a handful of pills each day.Make annual dental and physical exams a must. This simplifies the process of fixing problem that can become major issues if they are allowed to fester.Eat simple food. If you need a snack, eat a peach instead of a bag full of chips or cookies.Be your own therapist. Journal, talk to your dog, talk to your friends, get in some hard physical exercise or yard work, focus on others...Use only cash and cancel your credit cards.Pay off your debts. It's simpler to pay a few bills instead of a dozen or more.Spend time building relationships instead of surrounding yourself with stuff. $500 shoes will be so out next season but the time spent with your grandmother will be priceless.Realize that anything you buy will have initial costs, maintenance costs, cleaning costs, updating costs, time costs, etc. Buy accordingly.Have a date nite with your hubby and with each of your kids regularly. You don't have to do anything fancy, even baking cookies with your daughter will create nice memories of quality time spent together.Spend time on activities that have a payoff. Watching TV only results in a larger ass and a dent in the couch cushion. Knitting, baking, working in your garden, reading a \"how to\" book, and other such activities result in something tangible at the end of your efforts.Pray or meditate. This is free, it clears your mind, it focuses your thoughts, and it's relaxing.Buy clothes that don't need special care. If clothes won't pass the washer/dryer test, I don't buy them.Walk until something interesting happens. I have often heard travelers say this and it's true. If you just walk, something interesting is bound to happen whether you run across a patch of wild blackberries, stop and chat with a homeless person walking down the street by you, or you find something interesting to photograph.Focus on being a happier/nicer/better person. Good manners and a good attitude are free and make everyone around you happier.Eat your main meal at lunch. Breakfast should be super simple and dinner should be super small so lunch is where you can really shine with your cooking.Find free stuff to do in your community--you'll have fun, meet like-minded people, and enjoy some new experiences.Travel with only one bag. It's easier to keep track of your stuff, cheaper since you don't pay additional baggage fees, and easier to carry.Breathe. Go outside, inhale deeply, exhale deeply...this is an instant relaxer, it's free, and it's good for your health.Use simple (and natural!) cleaning products in your home. Marketers have people thinking that they need dozens and dozens of cleaning products for their home when you really only need a few things like rags, bleach, baking soda, vinegar, etc.Donate your books to the library. If you have stacks and stacks of books that you will probably never read again why not donate them then borrow them back again if you really need to read them (which you probably won't do because you have already read them!).Spend time at the library--read, take your kids to story time, borrow a video, use the internet--all free, enjoyable, simple things to do.If something bothers you, fix it or replace it. A squeaky door? Instead of listening to it squeak, put some oil on the hinges. A super slow, nearly dead computer? Replace it instead of babying it along.Make memories for people. Bring flowers from your garden to a neighbor, bake cookies for a busy single mom, take pictures at an event and give copies to friends who were there, etc.Disengage from people who make you angry, tense, stressed, or feel bad. Some people just won't be happy no matter what you do. Keep them as far away from you as possible.Have one inbox--for mail, kids school forms, work, etc--and clear it out regularly.Enjoy the holidays...simply. I have a few friends whose holiday preparations would put Martha Stuart to shame. You don't need to change your entire decor according to the season, you don't need a 20 foot Christmas tree that bulges under the weight of the decorations, doing simple things like carving pumpkins or putting a string of lights in your window will show just as much holiday cheer as something elaborate. Understated is good.How many phones do you need? Some people have an office phone, home phone, and cell phone when they could really get by with just one cell phone.Throw potluck get togethers instead of footing the bill at a fancy restaurant.Limit your online time--it can complicate, rather than help simplify, your life."},
{"title": "I Want You to Be Rich", "date": "Sunday, September 5, 2010", "text": "And no, that isn't the title of some cheesy book or money-sucking infomercial.  I actually want you to get out of debt and start accumulating wealth because:It will give you options.  When you have cash, have absolutely no debt, have an emergency fund, and your bank account is nice and plump, you have options.  Lots of them.  Want to start a new business?  Want to take the hubby on a surprise vacation or give him an amazing present for his birthday?  Want to support your child's dream of becoming an Olympic gymnast?  You can do basically anything when you have the financial resources that wealth gives you.It will cut down your stress considerably.  When you have wealth, the number one cause of stress (and divorce!), namely financial problems, go away.  The daily stresses of worrying about your job/bills/debt is replaced with relaxation and enjoyment of the day.  Your health will probably improve as well.You will be a role model to others.  How many people do you know who are debt free, have plenty of money for all of their needs and many of their wants, and are very content with their financial life?  If you answered \"no one\" or \"not many\", you are like most average Americans.  We simply have so few good financial role models that we don't have anyone to teach us how to be good stewards of our financial life.  Once you are debt free and building wealth, you will be an inspirational role model to others.You will be able to buy what you want.  You will also not want much.  When you go from broke to rich, you learn the value of money and you also get to learn what is important, namely that the steps to getting rich--paying off debt, paying cash for what you want, and saving and investing your money for the future--teaches you that no material item feels as good as being debt free feels.  So that while you may have the money when you are rich, to buy anything you want, the general materialist temptations that affect most people in our society will cease to tempt you.You will be able to give to others.  It's hard to give to others when you don't have much.  Financial entanglements and drama often occur because while you want to help someone out financially, you also need your money for your own debts, so if you give a loan you NEED the money back at some point in time.  When the money doesn't come back, you end up with all sorts of drama.  How much better would it be to have money that you can simply give away as a gift to a friend, a donation to your church, or a new car to your mother, without the problems that giving a loan incur?You will be able to \"live like no one else\".  I love that quote from Dave Ramsey because it is true.  I would hazard to guess that 99% of the people I know simply can't live exactly the way they want to live because they are in debt and have no wealth.  They are tied to jobs that stress them out, huge mortgages that keep them working like a hamster on a wheel, and an ever present fear of total financial meltdown.  How much more creative and happy would people be if they could live like no one else?Anyway, my wish for you is that you become debt free, then become financially free.  Free to do what you want, when you want, and live exactly as you want.  I bet that once you pay off your debt, and have plenty of cash in the bank, Labor Day will have a whole new meaning to you.  Happy Labor Day!"},
{"title": "10 Happenings this Weekend (Along with Money Lessons)", "date": "Saturday, September 4, 2010", "text": "It's starting off to be an interesting weekend...A friend had breast cancer surgery yesterday and it looks like she will be fine.  The lesson: catching medical problems early will save you money and could possibly save your life.  Also, having health insurance is a very good thing, especially when major problems come up--it could save you from ending up bankrupt.Another friend's daughter ended up in jail a couple days ago.  Stupid teenager.  When my friend called me in a panic, we took care of the basics and eventually the kid got bailed out.  The lesson: you never know when your emergency fund will come in handy and in this case, if my friend hadn't had a good sized emergency fund, her daughter would still be in jail.I heard about this local story and was horrified.  Vancouver, WA is not a big city and the people there are pretty laid back.  I would expect this hideous crime in a big city, not a smaller town where such things \"never happen\".  The lesson: this young girl was going to Starbucks like many of us do every day.  She had no idea that her entire world would be turned upside down and that she would not be able to go back to work the following day and that she would incur medical expenses and...you get the idea.  Another example of why having an emergency fund could come in handy when you least expect it.There are blackberries and apples growing wild all over the place so this morning on my walk I picked some of both.  The lesson: foraging for wild food can be fun (and can save you a lot of money over paying for the store-bought stuff).As I was walking this morning I had kind of an epiphany.  I was really happy for the opportunity to get out in nature and walk.  It also dawned on me that I am perfectly happy without a car.  The lesson: a two person household can easily get by with one car if you arrange things well.  Hubby and I have been sharing one car for more than two years and it has saved us LOTS of money and also makes us work together more to efficiently coordinate the use of said car which I think is good for the marriage.I'm getting ready to go on a month and a half long vacation.  Right now I am trying to cram 45 days worth of clothes into one carry on.  Yikes.  The lesson: layering clothing is a good idea.  A more important lesson:  when I first started shopping for the clothes I would take, I was so hung up on brands and having lots of clothes to take that I didn't buy anything because the cost was so overwhelming.  Fast forward to this week when I decided I better get busy on this project.  For some reason I came to my senses and realized that the most important thing that I am looking forward to about the trip is exploring new places, being with the hubby, and meeting up with family and friends along the way.  No one will care, five years from now, if I was wearing a North Face Jacket.  So I went to Ross and the Eddie Bauer outlet and for less than the cost of the NF jacket I really wanted, I was able to get a cute purse (instead of the Coach purse I wanted), a huge carry on (instead of the Timbuk2 one I had been eyeing), a pair of pants, three tank tops, a nice Eddie Bauer rain jacket that will pack away real small, six pairs of sox, a cute tee shirt, a comfy long sleeve shirt, leggings, and a dress.  Wow.A friend called from out of the blue saying she had just got into town and asked if I wanted to meet her for lunch.  The lesson: I realized as I was waiting for my friend at the restaurant that if I hadn't scaled back my lifestyle and changed my spending habits that #1 I would probably have been working this weekend instead of having a flexible job that allows me to work when I want.  And #2, before I would have made up an excuse and declined because--back then--I often didn't even have $5 to my name and what if I needed to pay for lunch and didn't have the money?  Now, with cash on hand and an emergency fund, this is not a worry and I am often happy to treat friends to lunch or Starbucks simply because I can.  Today my friend paid which was a nice surprise and a nice way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  We are \"eating down\" our food supply.  The idea is to have no food left in the refrigerator and minimal stuff in the cabinets when we leave so we won't have to throw away any food.  The lesson: if you will be gone for a period of time, instead of continuing to shop for groceries like you usually do, get creative with the stuff you have and clean out your fridge/cabinets.  This will both save you money on grocery shopping before your trip AND it will keep you from throwing out all of the perishables before you leave so you don't come back to a whole bunch of green, fuzzy stuff in your fridge.I'm going to end up with a free Christmas tree this holiday season and a clean, de-mossed roof.  I do some freelance web design as a side business and a friend of a client called to see if I could make him a website.  He has some money to spend but not a lot and as we got to talking, I learned about some of his skills (namely he repairs roofs and has a Christmas tree farm).  The lesson: don't hesitate to barter!  After chatting for a bit and getting an idea about the amount of the work I would put into his project, I made him a great deal (which he accepted).  He would pay a lower than usual fee for the work I would provide AND he would give me a free Christmas tree this winter and clean up our roof this fall.  Cool.I got a nice deposit of AdSense revenue into my bank account from the handful of blogs I run (it's free to set up blogs and add AdSense ads), I connected with a bunch of friends and family via Twitter and FaceBook these past couple days, texting allowed me to send out messages to a few friends who I know are looking for jobs when I came across \"help wanted\" signs at some local businesses, and because of a notice on a travel blog I follow, I will be attending a free \"Meet, Plan, Go\" event week after next.  The lesson: technology--especially free technology--rocks!I can hardly wait to see what tomorrow brings!"},

Karin made a comment about #34 on the list so I thought I would expand on the idea a bit...Here's some ideas for making your millions on the internet:You can literally take a good idea, do some work on your computer, and end up a millionaire like this girl.Don't have a good idea but have an unusual, strange, or bizarre idea?  Those can make you a millionaire as well.  Check out this blog for inspiration.Here's some more interesting ideas for making lots of money online from people who have actually done it.And did you know you can make six figures just by posting YouTube videos?

{"title": "43 Things I've Learned About Money in 43 Years", "date": "Sunday, August 29, 2010", "text": "This seems to be a theme around the internet...listing a number of things you have learned about a particular topic during your life.  Here's my list:Never co-sign for anyone. Never, Never, Never.Don't use credit cards, they will just bury you in debt.If your man/woman requires continuous infusions of cash because they can't seem to be able to get their life together, kick them to the curb.Always have an emergency fund because you are guaranteed to have an emergency (or two, or three) during your life.There will always be \"great deals\" so you can be OK about not snatching up every great deal you run across.The fewer things you have, the less time, money, and effort you spend maintaining them.Paying for experiences is better than paying for material goods.It's a great feeling to give money to people occasionally (even better if you give the money anonymously or give to a stranger).Tithing is NECESSARY.If your habits are making you fat, broke, and depressed, change your habits.If a salesman ever says \"this deal is only good now, if you don't buy THIS MINUTE you won't get the deal\", walk away.  Quickly.ALWAYS start a business with as little money as possible, no more than $1000 at most.You don't need a completely new outfit (complete with shoes and a purse) for every social occasion.  Most people have a hard enough time remembering what they had for breakfast yesterday, remembering what you wear to every event is really not important to them.You can live quite happily in a smaller home than you think.Families raised in small houses tend to get along better.You can't fix other people's problems.  Especially their money problems.People should only work 20 or 30 hours a week.  There is too many interesting things to enjoy instead of working.When you die, you aren't taking ANY of your stuff with you so why strive so hard to collect as many material goods as possible?Travel to third world countries; not only will you spend less on vacation, but you will see how little most people on the planet need to actually survive.Always think positive, prosperous thoughts.Appreciate the stuff you have.There's something you can do right now to make money if you put a little effort into it.Help others more than you ask others to help you.Experiment with your life (ie: no spend weeks, no junk food weeks, walk a marathon, etc), it makes life more interesting.Never buy the first generation of ANY technology, let the early adaptors work the bugs out first.If you are feeling guilty about things you are doing with money (embezzling from the company, spending the electric bill money on shoes, etc) don't do it.  That feeling is your common sense trying to keep you out of trouble.Stay home as much as possible...you'll save money this way.Be debt free, there is no better feeling.Vices (smoking, drinking, gambling, drugs) are expensive and addictive.Never buy a new car on credit, you will be paying 100% of the retail value for a car that just lost 20% of its value when you drove it off the lot.  Does. Not. Compute.Never lease or rent to own anything.Avoid: payday lenders, time shares, marketing schemes, pyramid schemes, \"too good to be true\" emails, etc.Great people skills along with being able to learn quickly and having a unique, necessary, skill set will nearly guarantee you a job.The internet has put the possibility of becoming a millionaire right at your fingertips.The library is one of the greatest boons ever to mankind.If you absolutely must take out loans for higher education, the total should be less than half of the average starting salary for the job you are studying for.If your job is making you so stressed that you become ill at the thought of going to work on Monday mornings, quit.Retail therapy (within reason) can be a good quick fix for a number of ailments.Whatever the masses are doing, consider doing the opposite (the masses are usually wrong as they are often manipulated by the media, peer pressure, etc).You are only as good as the people you hang around with (this applies to all areas of your life).When you are ready to give up, turn your problems over to God and relax.There is no better investment in your (physical and financial) future than preventive maintenance for your health.Look for ways, no matter how small, to enjoy life every day."},
{"title": "11 Ways to Avoid (Legal Problem-Inspired) Debt", "date": "Thursday, August 26, 2010", "text": "Every time I am in court for Monday morning arraignment (for work!), I start counting heads and end up with a ballpark figure of how much the group of people slated for arraignment that morning will eventually dump into the county coffers.  It is usually a five or six figure amount.  Wow.  If you want to avoid supporting your local county court system (and bankrupting yourself in the process), here's some ways to stay out of financial (and legal) trouble:Don't drive without a license.  I am amazed at the number of people who are already in legal trouble, have their license suspended, then continue to drive anyway.  They just end up burying themselves in more legal trouble, and more legal fees when they get caught driving without a license!Don't drive without insurance.  Most states now require that drivers have liability insurance at minimum.  The fine in our state for driving without insurance is $550, but should the driver get in a wreck, or worse, kill someone, the legal and restitution costs go up exponentially.Drive safely.  Since many people have driven unsafely in the past, our state now has laws (and fines) for a variety of unsafe activities such as not wearing a seat belt, texting or talking on your cell phone while driving, not having your child in a car seat, etc.  Be a safe driver and avoid these kinds of fines.Don't drive drunk.  Ever.  The minimum cost for a first time DUI can range from $3000 to $5000.  Side affects of this usually include a steep rise in insurance costs, loss of driving privileges, and occasionally the loss of a job if your job requires that you have a clean driving record.  Then there is the tragic loss of life thing that often happens when someone drives drunk which you can't put a price on.Plan for the kids you are going to produce.  A quick roll in the sack with a one night stand can lead to eighteen YEARS of child support.  Plan accordingly.Try to work out marital problems.  A divorce is a horribly messy affair that costs everyone big time.  When you consider the cost of lawyers, alimony/child support, and maintaining two separate households, the much smaller fee for marriage counseling can be a real bargain.Have insurance.  You never know when you will get in a car wreck or have someone fall off of your deck.  By having comprehensive insurance coverage (life, health, auto, home) you will be covered for events that could result in financial and legal liability.Just say no...to drugs, fighting, gangs, etc.  A sure path to legal problems and legal-related debt is to participate in things that will land you in legal trouble.  If you know that something you are considering doing is illegal, don't do it.  Everything from fighting and dealing drugs to gang activity and corporate embezzlement can lead to lawyer fees, court fines, and even incarceration.  Yikes. Never, never, never co-sign for someone.  Whether you are co-signing a loan, co-signing a cell phone contract, or putting up your house to bail someone out of jail, you are just asking for a trip through the court system to try to get your money back (which even then probably won't happen because the person you are signing for has no money, no credit, and no sense of responsibility).  Small claims courts are just brimming over with these types of cases.Pay your taxes.  It is illegal not to do so and the IRS is better than most any other debt collector at getting the money that is owed to them.  If you don't pay, you will be subject to fines, interest, penalties, and in really bad cases, lawyer fees and court fees.Realize that you are legally and financially liable for your children's activities and prepare accordingly.  Parents who supervise their kids, set limits, and keep their kids too busy to get into trouble, are better off than parents whose children are unsupervised, bored, and get into all kinds of trouble with their friends which can then cause the parents to have to pay fines, court costs, lawyer fees, etc.Those are the most common types of ways that people find themselves in trouble with the legal system then dinged with all kinds of legal fees.  By avoiding these problems, you will have a nice clean legal record and lots more money in your pocket!"},

There's lots of great tips as well as a different challenge each day to help you see how your activities impact the earth, other people, and even yourself.On a side note, because we have already cut back on our shopping, we have been able to switch our garbage pick up to every other week which saves us money (and creates lots less trash to go to a landfill).  I am hoping that this experiment will teach me even more ways to not only be \"greener\" but save money as well.Starting on the 29th, I will blog each daily challenge.

{"title": "My Annual Bill Update", "date": "Saturday, August 21, 2010", "text": "Each year I take a bit of time to update my bill list.  I do this for a number of reasons--first, I can check each bill and see if there are ways that I can lower the bill or maybe even get rid of it all together.  The second reason I do this is to make sure I have all of the most current information about the bill on a list I keep in my computer; this includes the account number, the mailing address, and the contact number in case I need to discuss the bill with the creditor/company.  There's been more than a few times when I was out of town or just didn't have the most recent bill with me and needed to contact the company--it's is a major hassle if you don't have the contact info and your account number to do this. Here is my bill list and things I have done to try to reduce these bills:Mortgage payment.  Since our interest rate is at 4.25% and we are on a 15 year fixed rate loan, there is not much more I can do to make this payment lower without stretching out the term which I don't want to do.  I want to get this bill paid off AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!  We did change our house insurance to bundle it with our car insurance so that saved us about $200 per year off of this bill.Cell phone bill.  We have a very old plan from TMobile which gives us two lines, text messaging, and internet for around $70 per month.  There are cheaper plans (like the $25 per month Virgin Mobile pre paid plan) but then we would have to cancel both lines and pay a $400 early termination fee.  I think we will just wait until the contract ends to switch to a prepaid plan.Tithe.  I tithe every month to the Unity Church since I do not go to a local church.  Oddly enough, it seems like the more money you tithe, the more money you get and if you stop tithing, the money stops coming in too.  Tithing is a good thing.School bill.  We pay $40 every month to send one of hubby's grandchildren to school in the Philippines.  We think this is a solid investment in the family's future and will make a big difference in the child's life so we are happy to pay this bill each month.IRS.  Being self employed, I need to pay my own taxes.  A few years back my accountant made a mistake which put me a year behind paying my taxes which I am still trying to catch up on.  I recently made a deal to get these back taxes paid off by next spring.  Unfortunately, taxes are one bill you can't lower unless you quit earning money!Health insurance.  We pay $38 a month for very comprehensive health insurance for the hubby and I.  This is an extreme bargain considering what other people pay for health insurance so I am happy to pay this bill.Car insurance.  We changed our car insurance about six months ago to liability only because the car was getting older.  Since we only have one car, we pay $53 a month for insurance.  I could try calling around and getting quotes from other insurance agencies but I think this is a good price plus we get a discount on our mortgage insurance because it is through the same company.Cable TV/internet/phone.  If you read some earlier posts, you know that our bill for these services shot up to almost $180 per month.  I called the company and took off a bunch of TV stations so our next bill should be around $110.  I would love to cancel all of these but hubby loves his TV and we both love our internet and the price would have been the same with or without phone service.Electricity.  Electricity is about $55 a month.  It goes up about $20 more than this in the winter because we tend to use space heaters instead of heating the entire house.  We could probably make a bit more effort to lower this bill such as unplugging and even selling appliances (a big freezer, a second refrigerator in the garage) that we don't use.Garbage.  Garbage is $42 every three months.  We already switched to having our garbage picked up every other week as opposed to every week because we really don't generate much garbage and this cut our bill down from what we paid for weekly service.  The only way to get rid of this completely would be to haul our own garbage to the dump and that seems yucky so I will keep this service.Sewer.  Since we aren't on a septic tank, we pay our sewer bill of approximately $104 every other month.  This is the base residential rate and won't go down no matter what we do.Water bill.  We pay $50 every other month for water and again, this is a base residential rate so we can't lower this bill either.Gas bill.  Because we have gas heat and hot water, our gas bill ranges from $20 in the summer to $100 in the winter.The only other bills we have are a couple of hubby's credit cards that we are working diligently to pay off, and annual bills for my business (PO box rental, licensing, website hosting).  I would LOVE to sell the house and sell everything and see almost all of these bills disappear but we are waiting until (hopefully) the economy improves and home prices rise before selling."},
{"title": "My Four Savings Accounts", "date": "Thursday, August 19, 2010", "text": "For most people it is hard enough to keep up with one savings account. For me it is easier to have multiple separate savings accounts so I don't accidentally use money that should have gone to something else. Here's why I have four savings accounts:Emergency fund. This savings account will (eventually) have six months of living expenses saved in it. In the event that I lose my job or some other calamity strikes, having at least six month's worth of living expenses in an account that is easy to access can be a life saver. Note that I don't use a credit card for this. I've seen quite a few people who have a crisis or lose their job then use a credit card to pay for everything--food, gas, bill payments--which only puts them even deeper in debt at a time that they can least afford it. Everyone should have an emergency fund.The \"my friend is having a crisis\" fund. I usually keep about $200 in this account. I have a lot of friends and at some point it is a given that one or more of them will have a crisis so I use this money for everything from taking them for a coffee at Starbucks to giving them cash when I feel it is warranted (which isn't a loan but just a small amount of cash that I can give as a gift and not expect back). The good part about having this account is that I don't have to worry about taking money out of my everyday expense budget if I need to run to the store and buy someone who is in the hospital flowers or if someone NEEDS cash (and with only $200 available there is a built in limit to how much cash I have to give someone so there is no temptation to give more than I can afford).My travel fund. This savings account is where I save money to use for travel which is one of my main goals in life. We love to travel but since we pay cash for everything these days, having this account automatically tells me when we can travel and how much we can spend. Little bit of cash in the account? We need to save more or CraigsList some stuff. Lots of cash in the account? We can plan a longer/more elaborate vacation.My retirement fund. I do save a small percent of my income and put it in this account. This is money that I NEVER, EVER want to touch until I am around 70 years old. When I get more money in this account I will diversify it into other, higher yield investments but for now, there isn't much in this account but it is a start. I find that having this account and keeping it separate helps me see that I am saving for my future while not making me feel like all of my savings is being held until I am old--I want to enjoy some of my money now which is what the other savings accounts are for.It is fairly simple to set up separate savings accounts. These accounts that I have are fee free and earn a teeny tiny bit of interest. Most are attached to checking accounts which has the added bonus of being able to be used by the bank to cover any accidental overdrafts at no charge. I highly recommend that people have actual savings accounts so that they can see the money building up and, unlike keeping their extra money in a cookie jar, can be safely held at a bank until you need it."},
{"title": "Sacrifice Beauty for Cold Hard Cash?", "date": "Tuesday, August 17, 2010", "text": "This is the story of how I ended up with a super short new haircut...I have had the same hairdresser and have gone to the same salon for over 15 years.  The cost is reasonable for a haircut (considering my sister pays about $180 each month to get her hair done and it looks like it was attacked by a weedwacker, I consider the $40 I pay to be a great price) and I have since switched to coloring my hair at home to save money (it was $150 at the salon, only $10 at home) so I figured with a good cut I could sacrifice the salon color part because it really does look the same if I do it at home (I taught hubby how to do foils so now I get the layered color look at home!).Anyway, hubby always goes to the local chain (cheap) haircutting place in town and until today I have flatly refused to go.  I mean I can sacrifice a lot of things to save money but when it comes to my hair...um...no.  With my kinky mass of hair I have had more than my share of horrible haircuts so when I found someone who could do my hair, I clung to her like she was my hair savior.Back to the story...Today in the bundle of advertising flyers that comes in the mail each week was a coupon for the haircutting place that hubby likes to go to.  Again, he said \"why don't you just try the place...it will save you money!\"  I guess I was feeling a bit wild and rebellious because I picked up the coupon and while I really had no intention of going to the place, it just so happened that I ended up driving by after I went to the mall.  The place was nearly empty so I threw caution to the wind and went in.  It isn't a salon.  They don't even wash your hair first, just spray it with water to wet it down.  The first girl that came up to me looked like she was tweaking on meth.  No kidding.  So I pointed to the other girl and said I wanted her to cut my hair.  It then dawned on me that I haven't had to find someone to cut my hair in 15 years and I had no idea of how to go about doing so.  Can you just look at someone and know if they can cut hair?  I crossed my fingers and sat down in her chair.  If nothing else, since she had kinky hair like mine, I figured she could sympathise with my hair, something that people with straight hair can't do.She asked what I wanted.  Feeling wild (again) I told her to surprise me.  She spun me around so I couldn't see what she was doing but by the long clumps of hair that were dropping to the floor, I figured something major was going on.  Amazingly (for a quick cut chain place) she took an inordinate amount of time on my hair.  When she got done I was certainly surprised, it was much shorter than I had ever had my hair before, but it also felt very freeing, both because I was able to let go of my preconceived notions about not being able to live without the person who always cuts my hair and it was literally freeing--my head was actually lighter without all of the hair on it!  The final bill was $15 including tip!  Amazing.Overall I am happy with the new look.  It was pretty surprising to hubby and his friends when I came back and it may take him a while to get used to it but I really do like it. I must have been on some kick today because I also changed the color of my hair.  Hubby was surprised...again.  I guess I could come home with another tattoo if I really wanted to push him over the edge but the change in my hair will suffice for today.The moral of the story is that it really can pay to challenge the things that you think you could NEVER change.  Sometimes the things that we cling to could actually be holding us back (or at least costing us more money than we need to spend).   ~The End~"},

What better way to enjoy a late summer weekend than at a national park?  Check here for future fee free days thanks to the NPS.Tomorrow, August 15th, the new overdraft legislation goes into affect.  If you want to have your bank cover your bounced checks, you will need to officially \"opt in\" in order to be covered.  This may be a great deal, depending on if you tend to bounce checks.I'm filling out my form today to get a $75 \"cash for appliance clunkers\" program.  You need to Google 'cash for appliances' and then your state as each state is administering this program separately.  I checked out the Washington state site and found that while the refrigerator rebate wasn't so great (only $75, however we had already sold our old fridge for $400 on CraigsList), we haven't yet been able to sell the old dishwasher so getting a $75 rebate for it will be great!One of my favorite outdoor stores, REI, is having a 20% off one item at their online outlet store sale.  I am looking at getting a bike (to complete my goal of biking from Canada to Mexico in the spring) and with the already discounted outlet price along with an extra 20% off, the $500 bike will cost around $300!

{"title": "A Goal Update and a Cool Link", "date": "Saturday, August 7, 2010", "text": "First, a quick goal update:Goal #8, sing on Wowowee, is now impossible since the show was cancelled. Wowowee was a really popular TV show in the Philippines which featured singers, dancers, game show segments, the opportunity for \"regular people\" to win lots of money, audience interaction, and the opportunity to showcase your talent to the world. Last time we were in the Philippines we were in the audience of the show and a friend said that I should sing (in Tagalog, the Filipino language) on the show since I had sung the night before at a nightclub in Manila with a couple of famous Filipino singers; the idea of singing on TV at the time was pretty terrifying so I declined. Then I thought that I should have done it because it would have been something unique to do so I added it to my list of this year's goals since we planned to be in PI anyway. Unfortunately, even though the show was super popular, the TV station and the host of the show had some kind of falling out and the show was cancelled with about a week's notice. Bummer. Anyway, the idea isn't totally gone, when we go to the Philippines in the fall, I may still \"showcase my talent\" on TV somehow. Goal #13 is completed. I just received my renewed passport in the mail and I am ready to visit the world!And here's a cool link...A visual height/weight chart.p.s. I am going back to my \"health month\" habits. For the last week, after I finished my health month, I went back to my daily Starbucks drinks and eating junk food and I am feeling awful. I need to jump back on the health bandwagon!"},
{"title": "20 Signs You're Dating a Loser", "date": "Thursday, August 5, 2010", "text": "My friend just called with her latest boyfriend drama.  It may have been interesting if this wasn't like the hundredth time I've heard the same story, only the guy's name had changed.  I think her man picker is broken since she chooses the EXACT SAME kind of guy each time and ~~surprise~~ they all end up being about the same...charming her, taking her money, then there is some horrible break up at the end.  Don't get me wrong, she is a nice person and a great mother, she just has a soft spot for anyone who is needy (which is fine when you are talking about children, not so fine when you are talking about a grown man that can't take care of himself).  So, instead of me ranting to her (I try to be tactful but my tact skills aren't that great) I will point out here how to determine if you are dating a loser (note that the loser could be a man OR a woman):They ask if you can pay their cell phone bill because they want you to be able to reach them but they can't afford to pay this month (or the next, or the next).They call (collect, of course) from jail and ask you to post bail for them (run fast, run far away from them if this happens!).They have any kind of substance abuse problem.  No ifs, ands, or buts, substance abuse will always be the most important thing in their life if the problem isn't fixed.  They have a police record (especially if it is long, especially if it is recent).  This means they are lacking good judgement and impulse control.  Yikes.They can't hold a job and of course this is everyone else's fault but theirs.They ask you to put their bills (credit cards, cell phone contracts, etc) in your name because they have lousy credit.You find yourself always buying stuff for them...clothes, jewelry, cars (!).They are always on the verge of homelessness and even their family won't take them in.You have reason to believe they are cheating on you (they are probably conning a number of people at the same time).They have no friends (they have probably burnt all of their bridges and you are just the most recent target).They seem so sincere even though all they while they are working on extracting even more money from you.They steal.  Anything.  At all.They get caught lying/stealing/doing something else they aren't supposed to be doing and apologize profusely (sometimes even with tears!) but as soon as the dust settles, they go right back to doing the same old thing and never change.They lie.  Often.  About everything.They are abusive to you or others (verbal abuse, physical abuse, etc).  Note that people who are abusive don't change without significant intervention. I hope you are long gone by then.They are manipulative and play on your weaknesses.They have a bad temper which makes you want to placate them so they won't be unhappy.  Usually this involves your subservience and your money.They make you feel guilty, ashamed, sad, depressed, etc.  You want to be with someone because they make you feel better than if you were alone.  If they make you feel worse, you are better off being by yourself.They seem to live in a constant state of drama.They make you crazy.  You used to be happy and normal, now you are paranoid, jittery, and have no self esteem.  Whatever you give them (money, attention, etc) is never enough and so you try even more to please them.  This type of behaviour is a vicious cycle to which there is no end but by escaping.  So escape.  Now!Wow.  All of that venting made me feel better.  It probably won't do a whole lot for my friend because I am pretty sure her next guy is going to be SO GREAT in the beginning but by the end he (and she) will have left a long trail of drama and debt.

{"title": "Quick Goal Update", "date": "Tuesday, August 3, 2010", "text": "Wow...A lot has happened over the past couple of days...I got our tickets for Atlanta (one of the goals on my list)I got tickets to see Dave Ramsey in Atlanta!!!! (another goal on the list.  I'm psyched.  Plus I think it's cool that when you order tickets for his events online you can only use a debit card, not a credit card.  Hubby is paying down his credit card at a rate of $1000 per month.  Before he would just make the minimum payment because he though he would always have debt.  Now he sees a light at the end of the tunnel.  By March of next year we should be totally debt free except for the house.Also got our tickets for Connecticut (another goal on the list.  Coincidentally they have a World Poker Tour tournament while we will be there.  I thought we would have to go back in March to reach that part of the goal but I'm glad we can knock off both of these goals at the same time.  Note that hubby doesn't pay the thousands of dollars to play in the WPT, he does the qualifier tournaments at $50 a couple of times to try to earn his $10,000 entry).I cut down our cable bill today.  Another kudos to hubby because we cut his Filipino channel package which was something big for him to give up because he really likes those shows but cutting our cable bill in half was more important.  So now we pay $90 for phone, cable TV, and internet.  Which can still be considered a lot but it is much better than what we were paying.I'm trying to figure out how to cram travel to Vancouver BC, Victoria BC, Portland, OR, and Stehekin into my tiny budget.  We want to go to these places before the weather gets rainy.My big project for the next month is to monetize my blogs and websites.  I have a half dozen hobby sites that really need to earn me some money!Our travels in the fall will keep us out of town for a month and eight days.  I need to organize my work life.  Yikes.I'm going to try and not eat out for the next two months because once we start traveling, we will be eating out a lot.  By not eating out at all in August and September, we should save some money that could go towards our trip.Go parasailing is on the goal list.  Yesterday in downtown Seattle, I saw that a company actually does parasailing there.  I'm wondering if it is better to go parasailing here rather than in a foreign country where the safety laws may not be as stringent.  Hubby looked worried when I said that parasailing is on the list.  He doesn't like heights.All of our airline tickets were paid for with cash (debit card).  This is a first.  Before we used to use credit then have to pay back the bills long after we got back from vacation.  I love having cash on hand to spend on our goals!  Also, I booked through Orbitz.  Although I thought the prices were good, apparently if the prices for the tickets we bought go down even further, we get a refund for the price difference.  Cool."},
{"title": "Goal #2 Completed--Go to Tillicum Village", "date": "Monday, August 2, 2010", "text": "When I made my goal list, I added some local things to do because while we often travel across the country to do \"touristy things\", we have plenty of great tourist attractions in our own back yard that we have never visited before (in over 25 years!!). One of the local attractions we have often thought about visiting but just never got around to is the cruise, salmon dinner, and Indian dance show at Tillicum Village on Blake Island. I purchased the tickets a month in advance because they had a special going where if you booked a month in advance, you got $40 off the price (I want to achieve all of my goals but I need to do so as cheaply as possible!). It was a beautiful sunny day for the cruise, the dancing was nice, and the dinner was pretty good--I even ate bison for the first time. Goal #2, visit Tillicum Village--completed :)"},

I tend to go on \"food kicks\" and can literally eat the exact same foods every day for a month.  I need to change this.I love fruit but seriously need to eat more vegetables.It is HARD to lose weight!  Now I know why people are so fat...it's easier and much more enjoyable to eat what you want.I didn't eat any wheat and I think this improved my digestion.Overall, an interesting experiment, I've never logged my food before.I wish I would have lost more weight!"},
{"title": "10 Ways to Medically Self Insure", "date": "Thursday, July 29, 2010", "text": "Self insurance can be a spendy proposition.  Usually the only people who even consider self insuring (ie: covering all of their own expenses in lieu of getting regular insurance coverage) are the very rich or the very poor.  Here's ten ways to take care of yourself so that your need for medical insurance will be less (I still highly suggest having all of the insurance coverages you need--life, health, auto, home, etc).Get annual physical check-ups.  Finding and taking care of medical problems early is a very cost effective way of keeping yourself healthy and medical costs low.  Getting medical screenings every decade instead of annually is one way to nearly guarantee that you will face bigger, and more costly medical problems.Ditto for dental.  You should get a bi-annual teeth cleaning and annual dental exam for the same reason noted above.If you do have a medical problem, get the correct care.  Running to the emergency room when waiting for an appointment with your regular physician or visiting the urgent care would have worked just as well increases medical care costs and doesn't do a whole lot more for you medically speaking.  Caveat: you need to know when a medical problem is life threatening, urgent, or can wait...you don't want to die because you made the wrong call.Keep your vaccinations up to date.  Let's see...tetanus and lock jaw because you stepped on a rusty nail or getting a once a decade tetanus shot?  I would vote for the shot.Exercise and eat right.  This advice has been repeated ad nauseum but people still don't do it (I still don't do it either!).  The payoff can be years of strength, stamina, and good health and minimal medical expenses.Don't do things that put you in harms way.  Most people can stay relatively safe and healthy just by using common sense.  Don't smoke or drink.  Don't drive drunk.  Don't hang out in known gang areas or with known gang members.  Don't drive like a maniac.  Don't do any crazy stunts that you see on YouTube.  Etc.Prevent accidental injuries, or if you are accidentally injured, take steps before hand to mitigate your injuries (ie: wear a bike or motorcycle helmet, wear your seat belt, learn how to swim and swim only in marked swimming areas, etc).Make your home safe.  Many problems that require medical attention occur in the home.  From seniors tripping over throw rugs, to people falling off ladders, to babies ingesting poisons, to fires...many of these things can be prevented if you keep your home as safe as possible.Don't be so frugal it makes you ill or injured.  Eating every last leftover is a good way to save money but if the leftover in question smells funny, better to throw it out than risk food poisoning.  If you know that your deck is rotting but the cost to fix it is going to be a lot, bite the bullet and fix the deck...it's cheaper than a run to the emergency room.Take care of yourself as much as possible.  That was grandma's motto.  She didn't see the inside of a doctor's office or hospital for nearly 40 years because she took care of herself.  If she was sick, she would take vitamin C and sleep until it went away.  She took her vitamins.  She treated sunburns with vinegar.  In fact she had a whole repertoire of home remedies for anything that ailed us.The bottom line is that medical care is astronomically priced and insuring your way out of every possible problem is likewise, very expensive.  The better way to handle this?  Do what you can so that you won't need to cough up the big bucks for medical care."},
{"title": "10 Things I Wish I Had Done as a High School Grad", "date": "Wednesday, July 28, 2010", "text": "Teens that have just graduated from high school have been recently turned loose on the world.  Below are ten things that if I would have known (and/or adhered to) as a recent high school grad, would have set me up financially for life.I should have paid my way through college with cash and scholarships, even if it was a slower way to go, instead of taking out massive student loans that went for tuition, my apartment, food, and the occasional party.  Student loans will haunt you FOR LIFE until you pay them off and there is no worse way to start your life as a college graduate than by getting a bill for a whopping $60,000 (!) in the mail.I should have gotten into the habit of saving at least 10% of everything I earned instead of spending every last penny I made.I should have never got credit cards.  Credit cards equal debt.  Some people say you HAVE TO HAVE credit cards to build up your credit so you can take out a loan.  How about a novel idea...save your money and pay cash for the things you want and skip loans all together?I should have skipped getting a car and taken public transportation instead.  Of course as a teenager I wanted the best car I could possibly get (which meant a huge car loan) because I wanted to be \"cool\".  Now I look back and see that I would have been much \"cooler\" if I had a huge stash of cash instead of a huge car payment.I should have got an apartment with a dozen other kids and lived as lean as possible.  Being a teenager in the '80s and being unduly influenced by Dynasty and Miami Vice, I wanted the flashy lifestyle which meant my own beautiful apartment, eating out every day, and working more than full time in order to afford my extravagant life.I should have worked part time and enjoyed life more.  I started working full time at 16 and haven't stopped.  While I like working, your teenage years should be spent exploring your options and the world as opposed to worrying about getting \"your hours\" and trading your life for a tiny paycheck.I should have traveled around the world.  In many countries, world travel after high school is a rite of passage.  In my case, I went to Japan for a month after I graduated but had to rush back home so I could work and pay my bills.  Dumb move.  Really.I should have been lots less serious with my boyfriends.  I was engaged at 16, engaged at 18, then married someone else at 19 (who is my current wonderful hubby but I digress...).  When you are a young adult you should spend more time focusing on yourself instead of trying to be \"all grown up\" with \"all grown up relationships\" to match.  You don't need to rush to be an adult, you will have plenty of years to enjoy adult responsibilities.Plus one for me--I didn't have a baby as a teenager like many of my friends.  Of all of the teens I knew who had babies before their mid 20's, probably 90% or more ended up divorced, broke, many on welfare, and old before their time.  Now they are grandparent in their late 30s and early 40s!  Again, you will have plenty of years to be a parent.  Rushing to have a baby as a teenager for whatever reason isn't fair to you or the kid.I would have been open to more options.  Many people get on one track and stay there, mostly because they are afraid of change.  They stick with one so-so man because they are afraid they won't find anyone else (note, you usually find someone better), they stick with one so-so job because they are afraid they won't find anything better (note, you usually end up with an even better job when you switch), and stick with one so-so town because they are afraid of moving to a new place that seems interesting but scary (note, people move all the time and often become even more happy and successful when they find their 'right place').Anyway, that's what I would have/should have done.  Hopefully someone, somewhere will take some or all of this advice and enjoy tremendous success."},
{"title": "Just Say 'No' to Credit", "date": "Tuesday, July 27, 2010", "text": "Which is exactly what I did today. Way back at the beginning of this blog, I posted my overarching financial goals. I am happy to say that I paid off hubby's Target card today, then I called and cancelled the card. Having cancelled all of my credit cards a while back, I don't even flinch now when the person in the cardholder retention office grovels and tries to get us to keep our credit cards. A simple \"no, please close the account\" said about five or six times does the trick. Now we have only a few more big debts before we are debt free except for the house. I made a deal a while back with the IRS to pay $1000 a month towards my taxes so both the 2008 and 2009 taxes will be paid off by February, I have called the car repo creditor to make an offer in compromise but haven't heard back from them yet, and I now have hubby paying $1000 towards one of his credit cards each month (which he previously never thought was even possible).  Oddly enough, I feel richer now than when I had a handful of credit cards even though I have only about $1500 in savings as opposed to the tens of thousands I used to have in available credit on my credit cards.  Being debt free rocks!"},
{"title": "Technology Angst", "date": "Monday, July 26, 2010", "text": "This has been an angst ridden few days.  My cable/internet/phone bill shot up $28 from its already expensive $150 so I went on a mission to see what my options are and quite frankly, trying to figure out the whole TV/internet option thing is mind boggling.   Direct TV looked like it had a good price although a big reduction in the channels we are used to, plus I didn't like the part in the contract where it says \"you are locked into a two year contract yet we can raise our prices at any time and there is nothing you can do about it.\"  Lovely.  Dish Network appears to be similar.  Plus, if we switch to these TV service providers we still have to have internet with the cable company as it is the only option for high speed internet since I don't want the slower DSL option.  This whole thing seems like a huge racket.  I wish we could just drop cable all together but then we would have few if any stations where we live.  Other people I know have dropped cable and just watch Netflix but I am not really into movies as I like my CNN and weekly sitcoms (NCIS, Bones, etc).  So I ended up calling the cable company and telling them that I would be switching to a different provider because their prices were insane.  The customer retention lady said she could give me back our old price for six months so I decided to stay with our $150 a month cable for another six months.  Hopefully by then we will have all of our debts paid off and the value of homes will rise in our area and then we can sell our house and travel the world and not have to worry about a TV bill at all.

{"title": "25 Things About Me", "date": "Saturday, July 24, 2010", "text": "Taking a cue from one of Betsy's recent posts, I thought I would share a bit about myself.  A couple of times over the past few years, a blogger will start a \"25 things about me\" post then pretty soon everyone would do it and it actually ends up to be a pretty cool set of lists, kind of like a \"carnival about me\" in which you find out that your favorite bloggers really are the interesting, quirky people they appear to be.  I'm not sure how interesting or quirky I am but here goes...I have Asperger's Syndrome.  I am not horribly afflicted but it is there.I am also Face Blind to a degree.  A nice researcher at Harvard is trying to help me recognize faces.I can eat the same food every day for a month and it won't bother me.I can sing in a half dozen languages even though I don't often know what I am saying since if I hear a song, I can easily learn it phonetically (see #1).People think I am some sort of tech guru when in actuality, I just Google a lot.My husband is 20 years older than I am.  We are also an inter-racial couple (we didn't know we were an inter-racial couple until about eight years into our marriage when we saw a couple that looked like us on Oprah talking about their inter-racial relationship.  Me: \"hubby, did you know we are an inter-racial couple?\"  Hubby: \"no, who said\"  Me: \"Oprah\"  Hubby: \"wow...I didn't know that\"  Me: \"me neither.  Shocking.\").I love coffee drinks like a coffee frapuccino or Baskin Robbins cappuccino blast but have never drank a cup of coffee--the taste is overwhelmingly strong.I am child free by choice.  I admire wonderful moms and find kids to be interesting to observe but just never had the desire to have my own children.I hate drama in my life, I don't see the need for it.  Either your life is generally good and happy or you change it to make it so.  I don't understand people who need a constant flurry of drama to keep their lives interesting.I don't drink, smoke, or use drugs.  Ick.The shortest job I ever had was three days.  I had to sit at a desk and enter data into a computer.  My co-workers told me not to work so fast or it would make them look bad.  I thought if I had to work like that for the rest of my life I would want to slit my wrists eventually so I quit instead.I feel more comfortable around people from different cultures than around whites--odd since I was born and raised in a very rural, all white place.I can hear electricity.  Usually if I am standing near a wall or any other place that there is an electrical current, I can hear it.My purpose in life is to help people, I have known this nearly all my life.  I didn't finish college.  I made more money with my own business than I would have made being a teacher which is what I wanted to be when I went to college.I admire people who are successful in a variety of areas when being successful in any one area would have been a lifetime achievement for others.  John Nance is a good example, he is an airline pilot, colonel, famous writer, sought after speaker, etc.I love to read.  All throughout school, instead of going to the cafeteria for lunch, I would hang out in the library and read.  You can still find me at Barnes and Noble reading quite often.I need to be at sea level, near the ocean, most of the time.  It makes me happy.I can be very social and outgoing if it is part of my job, but I generally like to be by myself or hang out with the hubby.I have always worked, starting with working in the school cafeteria to get free lunches.  I bought my first car at 16 and my first house at 19.  I have always felt like an adult with adult responsibilities even when I was 12.I wish I was artistic.  I can barely draw stick figures.People think I can do a lot of things (rock climb, speak a foreign language, ballroom dance, design a website, etc) but I am really not that talented.  I am just always interested in learning new things and will try everything that comes along whether I am good at it or not.I need to figure out how to be comfortable having money.  My tendency is to spend it and I think this relates to when I was a kid.  Any time I got money someone (a parade of adults who were way irresponsible with money) would borrow the money I had saved and never pay it back.  I guess I feel like if I don't use my money right away, someone will take it away from me.I have five step kids.  Some I helped raise.  Others that I continue to help today.  Also 11 step grand kids and two step great grand kids (yikes!).I can bake amazing things but can't cook to save my life.So that's all I can think of about me.  I hope others who read this will write their own lists and link back to their list in the comments because I find this kind of info fascinating."},

{"title": "The Magic of Bartering", "date": "Tuesday, July 20, 2010", "text": "I just got back from my first Chinese lesson and I can now read, write, and say \"hi\", \"how are you\", and \"thank you\".  Not bad for my first lesson.  The best part?  My Chinese lessons won't be costing me anything except a bit of time because I found a lady from China who wants to improve her English so I offered to tutor her in English if she would give me two Chinese lessons a week.  Bartering rocks!I think many people are afraid to try bartering because you have to first, figure out what you have to offer in the trade, then go out and find someone who has the item/skill you need, then sell them on the idea of bartering.  It can be kind of intimidating when you first start out, especially if you have been raised up in the US economy where everything has a price tag and everyone just assumes that if you want or need something that you don't have, you will have to exchange US currency for it.Over the years we have bartered quite a few things--bowling lessons, bowling equipment, and bowling ball drilling when the hubby owned a pro shop; construction work for furniture and appliances; and internet work/website design for dental work.  Back when I worked in a fast food restaurant as a teen, we would even arrange weekly food swaps with other fast food restaurants because we got tired of eating our own food (and couldn't afford to buy anything else).  I also once arranged a barter when a friend's mom needed false teeth--he was able to trade his flooring installation services to a dentist to have his mom's remaining teeth removed, then trade his flooring installation services to a denture maker who wanted to get all of the flooring done in his son's house.  It was a \"win\" all the way around and everyone ended up happy with the services/items they received and it didn't cost anyone a cent.I highly recommend that you try bartering, if only just to see that you can do it.  Something as simple as swapping a night of child care with a friend can make you realize that in many situations, you don't need to part with your hard-earned cash if you don't mind giving a bit of your time or skills in order to get what you want."},
{"title": "Goal 19 Completed...Kind Of", "date": "Sunday, July 18, 2010", "text": "If you check out my list of goals for this year, you will see that \"Attend Tribal Journey\" is goal #19. This goal didn't quite work out the way I wanted it to, but I will consider it completed. Tribal Journey is a huge event where all of the tribes in our region send canoes for an annual gathering to a host tribe each summer. The tribal members literally paddle for days (weeks even depending on how far they are coming from) to participate in the event. I have often seen local tribes practicing for the event out in the bay but I have never attended the actual week-long event which is why it landed on my list this year.Anyway, the event is being hosted by the Makah Tribe at Neah Bay this year so while I really would love to be there and watch the event, logistically it just isn't going to happen. I had to work out in that area last Friday so I drove from my home to Neah Bay hoping that at least some of the canoes had come in a bit early (the official event starts Monday). After a nearly four hour drive, mostly along beautiful windswept but super narrow and windy roads, I made it. I stopped by and talked to some friends I know who live on the reservation and got the grand tour of the places on the reservation where all of next week's events will be happening at, got a run down on the preparations the organizers have been making (like how they will be cooking and serving food for about 10,000! people and plans for medical and other emergencies), and got to catch up with friends I hadn't seen in ages.  They did ask if I was coming back on Monday to volunteer but with no hotels available within a hundred mile radius, an eight-hour round-trip drive from my home, an expected 12,000 extra people who will be coming into a reservation that holds maybe 3,000 members, a tiny two lane road that I would have to be driving along with many thousands of others, and very limited facilities, I figured I would be more hindrance than help.  I suspect it will be a zoo out there and I am really not a fan of overwhelming crowds.  I have no doubt that it will come off well as the people who are putting the event together are really amazing, but I just decided that it would be better for all if I stay home and be one less logistic to manage.  I was, however, able to watch some of the inland tribe canoes as they stopped in Pt Angeles on their way to the event so that (kind of) counts."},
{"title": "The $10.86 Deck Refinishing Project", "date": "Saturday, July 17, 2010", "text": "Our deck was looking pretty shabby. Whoever owned the house before us decided to paint it instead of stain it (a bad idea I think), so after years of use and weathering, the paint was peeling and it was looking pretty awful. Fixing up the deck was on our \"to do\" list since we decided to take the house off the market, but hiring someone to do the job would have been an expensive proposition. So we decided to do it ourselves....did I mention we aren't really \"do it yourselfers\"?Here's the simple steps we took to redo our deck:#1  Ask around to find someone who had a pressure washer.  We were going to rent one of these machines to blast the loose paint off the deck but that too is spendy and we didn't know how long it would actually take to do the work and thus how long we would need to rent it for.  Turns out our cousin had just bought a pressure washer for his deck so we borrowed it.#2  Hubby pressure washed the deck which got rid of all of the peeling paint, dirt, and other nasty stuff.#3  Let the deck dry (easy to do because we have had an entire week of hot days)#4  Go to the store and look for some paint to buy.  Note that all exterior paint is kind of expensive (about $25-$30 per gallon).#5  Ask the counter guy at the store if they have any mis-tinted paint at which time he shows me a whole rack of paint mixing mistakes.#6  Pick up the only two gallons of mis-mixed exterior paint and do the happy dance to the register because it only costs $5 per gallon!#7  Go home and show hubby the paint to which he exclaims \"our deck is going to be bright green and off yellow???\"#8  Proceed to paint the top rail bright green, then the (many) spindles off yellow, followed by painting the deck itself bright green.  This takes about five hours and I got sunburned :(#9  Let the deck dry and then do some touch-ups of places I missed.#10  Took a picture to add to this blog post.Overall it was a pretty simple thing to do even though it seemed a bit overwhelming at first.  The colors actually came out well--they look like complementary colors and kind of actually blend into the overall color theme of the neighborhood.  I'm sure I missed some steps (like sanding the deck after it was pressure washed), but for a quick, efficient way to get the deck done without spending and arm and a leg, this worked!"},
{"title": "Days 1-10 of My Health Month", "date": "Sunday, July 11, 2010", "text": "One of my goals this year is to be as healthy as possible for a period of one month...no junk food, exercising every day, watching what I eat, etc.  A second goal is to make a doctor's appointment for my annual physical which I have skipped for the past few years.  These two seemed to be quite compatible so I decided to schedule my doctor's appointment 45 days out from July 1st and do my \"health month\" right up until my doctor's appointment.  Ideally this will mean I end up with good results from my medical exam and it gives me a really good reason to stick to my goal of being healthy for a month.

I haven't exercised as much as I wanted to but I have stuck to the dieting part pretty well.  Day 9 was a bit challenging because I went with my friend and another friend to her divorce hearing and after that she wanted to EAT.  Usually this is what we do...we go to a coffee shop and have dessert, then a frap...and it is hard to change habits in the middle of a crisis.  I think something as simple as not eating wheat (and all of the junk food that has wheat in it that I love--cookies, crackers, etc) along with not having a Frap/ice cream everyday has really made a difference.  The last ten days of my challenge I may try to take all fried foods off the list of food I eat as well."},
{"title": "25 Free Ways to Beat the Heat", "date": "Saturday, July 10, 2010", "text": "It's been a super hot few days here. Fortunately we haven't had the extensive heat the East Coast has had but my melting point seems to be about 80 degrees and it has been in the mid 90's for the last three day. With no central air, our house is hot, going outside is like stepping into an oven, and exercising outside has become nearly impossible. Here's some free ways we have found to \"beat the heat\":Go to the library, mall, or other public air conditioned place.Go to the free public beaches or fountains and play in the water.Take a cold shower.Open all of the doors and windows in the morning to let the cool air in; close them when it starts to heat up.Set a tray of ice in front of the fan for extra coolness.Spend most of your time in the one room that has an air conditioner.Have a picnic outside under a shady tree and eat dinner.If you must exercise or do other outdoor work, do it early in the morning before it starts to get warm.Do any house work that will heat up your home (cooking, baking, laundry, etc) early in the morning then air out your house before the temps heat up.Keep the drapes closed on the sunny side of the house to keep temps lower in your home.Wear loose fitting, light colored clothing--it will make you feel cooler.Take this opportunity to wash heavy blankets and rugs and hang them outside to dry--this will save lots of money over the cost of drying them in the dryer.Drink lots of cold water to both cool down your core and keep hydrated (skip the pop, coffee, and alcoholic beverages which actually can make you dehydrated).Eat light meals (salads, fruits, etc) and skip the heavy greasy meals that usually don't set well in high heat.Hang out in the coolest part of your home (in our case the basement is about 20 degrees cooler than the top floor of our home).Take it easy the first few days of hot weather.  It takes our bodies a bit of time to become acclimated to hotter weather so forcing yourself to keep up your usual frantic pace could be exhausting.  This is why \"siestas\" were invented.If your regular job includes working outside during the heat of the day, ask your employer if you and your co-workers can start earlier and leave earlier for the duration of the heat wave.Keep kids, pets, and the elderly cool.  They have a more difficult time regulating their body temperature when it comes to periods of high heat.Use your electricity reasonably.  During heat waves, cities and towns are more likely to suffer power outages due to the increased used of power (fans and air conditioners being used in each room of everyone's house) and the increased likelihood of overheated transformers.Entertain yourself and the kids.  Make a big pitcher of \"sun tea\" to enjoy and, if it is hot enough outside, let the kids experiment with frying an egg on the sidewalk.Take precautions to avoid being sunburned if you must be outside--cover up, wear a hat, and use plenty of high-SPF sunscreen.If your home is absolutely sweltering and you have no other options, call your local 211 and find out where your nearest community cooling shelter is.Keep an eye on those around you.  Exertion (even minor exertion if the person is elderly or ill) can result in heat exhaustion or heat stroke which requires immediate medical attention.During a prolonged heatwave, you will have other things to worry about as well: clearing your yard to prevent the spread of wildfire, being aware of areas that can suffer from flash flood, storing water for later use in the event your well dries up or city water becomes rationed, etc.Take special precautions with your car: fuel up during the cooler part of the day, pay attention to your gauges to prevent overheating, and never leave kids or pets (or anyone for that matter) in your car when the temperatures are even moderately hot as the interior can reach triple digits in a matter of minutes without the air conditioning on.Fortunately heatwaves don't usually last long, however each day during the hot weather can be miserable without taking some of the simple (free) precautions above.  With a bit of ingenuity and common sense, you will weather the heatwave just fine."},
{"title": "10 Things I Learned In the Last Few Days (Money-Saving Lessons Included)", "date": "Thursday, July 8, 2010", "text": "It's been a busy week.  Here's some stuff I have learned:I am not much of a kayaker.  I put \"go kayaking\" on my goal list for this year because I had never tried it and it looked like fun.  I ran across a flyer at our local military base that said they had weekly evening kayak trips for the bargain price of $30 which covered the equipment, guide, and transportation so I signed up.  Lesson #1, always write down your goals this makes your goals kind of come to you somehow!  Lesson #2, when you are checking off the stuff on your goal list, look for bargain-basement ways to accomplish them.  So we launched our kayaks and it was fun but a lot of work!  I saw all kinds of seals and sea lions and even watched a seal give birth (!).  We passed the seal and her pup on the way back and the momma had her pup on her back swimming around.  How cool!  I didn't bring my camera because I figured there was a good possibility that I and my camera could end up in the water.  Kayaking was OK but I don't like being completely attached to a boat.  If I tip over, I want to be able to swim away not be fighting to get loose from my boat.  Overall, a good experience but I like my boats with an engine, a captain, and a Lido Deck :) Another kayaking lesson learned...if you want to try out a new sport, rent the equipment first.  I can't count how many sports/activities I have been interested in so I proceeded to buy all of the gear and equipment FIRST (a big expense) and then found out I don't have much interest in it.  Save money, rent first.Our appliances are in!  And we were able to save the installation fee for the dishwasher by doing it ourselves.  Anything plumbing/electrical-related seems kind of daunting to me but between the hubby and I, we read the instructions and figured it out (and saved money in the process).When you are doing any renovation/construction project you need two things: extra money and a runner.  There were quite a few times I ended up running to the local Walmart/Home Depot for a part or pieces to complete a project.  Having extra cash on hand to purchases needed items is, of course, a good idea, and having a spare person (me in this case) to run to the store to get the items is also a good idea so the work doesn't come to a screeching halt if you are doing all of the work AND being the runner too.Treat your delivery people well.  The appliance delivery guys could have dropped off all of the appliances in our garage or just inside our house but as soon as they got to our house, the hubby offered them some ice-cold Cokes which made them happy.  They proceeded to bring the appliances in and set them up (except for the dishwasher which would have taken too much time), took all of the packing stuff off, plugged them in...basically all of the stuff I thought we would have to do, they did.  I then talked to their boss and told him how pleased I was with the service provided by the two delivery guys.  Lesson: treat people well and they treat you well.I'm glad we were prepared for the mini heat wave that happened in the middle of our project.  While other people were running to the local Walmart or home store to buy fans and air conditioners, we had bought these items at the end of last season at bargain prices.  All we had to do was unpack them and set them up and we stayed pretty cool even though the temps reached 98 today.You need to make a written list of goals.  None of this stuff (kayaking, a renovated kitchen) would have happened without my first having written down what I wanted.  Having written goals gives you a clear path to follow to accomplish your goals and gives you an incentive to get them done (like posting your successfully achieved goals in a public forum like this blog).  At the time I made the list, I had no money and had no idea how any of these things would get accomplished, I just knew that these were the things I wanted.  I was getting my hair cut a few days ago and I asked my stylist when she was going back to Italy since she had raved about her wonderful honeymoon there a few years ago.  Her response was \"some day.\"  To me that is kind of depressing.  If you really want something you need to write it down first, with a \"do by\" date, and then let the universe figure out how to get it to you.  Otherwise \"someday\" may end up to be \"never\".I am thankful for my wonderful hubby and I tell him so daily. A good marriage/partnership can save you money (hubby is the chief decorator in our house and can do a pretty good job at plumbing too!).  Having the resources of two people (their incomes, their skills, their natural talents) is also a boon for a family.  Meanwhile my friend's horribly contentious divorce is moving forward (another court appearance tomorrow) and she was even hospitalized recently due to the overwhelming stress of the situation.  Lesson learned: the work it takes for a good marriage is worth it (obviously both people need to have the same desire to make a marriage work though).Small things can make a big difference to people.  Another friend is a widow with four little kids.  She has no money but is such a great mom.  Her kids are pretty amazing too.  A few years ago when the oldest child was maybe five, I took a birthday cake to their house to celebrate the girl's birthday (birthday parties were new to this family which had recently immigrated from the Middle East).  So after the first birthday party, the next child's birthday came around and the entire extended family showed up when I brought a cake over.  There were about 18 people who had heard about the birthday party and wanted to see it for themselves.  Now it has become a routine, when one of her kid's birthdays come around, I bring over a big Costco cake and the whole family comes over for a party.  It is really a simple and inexpensive thing to do but it makes a huge impact on so many other people (especially the birthday kid!).  If everyone did simple things like this to make others happy, our world would be a better place!My health goal is working out well.  Since I made my doctor's appointment, I have been a model \"healthy person\".  No Starbucks, no junk food, no wheat, exercising....I don't know if it will last after I have my doctor's appointment, but I know that so far, eating healthier has saved me lots of money.  I used to go to Starbucks daily and haven't done so since June!  Ditto with the junk food purchases, ice cream stops, etc.  Hopefully this develops into a habit.That's all that has happened over the past few days...it's been busy but interesting."},
{"title": "How to Renovate Your House For Very Little Money", "date": "Monday, July 5, 2010", "text": "I haven't posted in a few days because we have been doing a bit of renovating around the house.  Since we didn't sell our house and now plan to stay here until the market improves (this could be a few years according to our realtor!), we decided to make some improvements.  As usual, I want to do this with as much of a bare-bones budget as possible.  This project is also on my goal list for the year, so while the motivation to do this project is there, we don't have a lot of money to actually do everything we want to do.  Here's what we have done/are doing:I started by having a friend who is a flooring installer measure our entire house for carpet and linoleum in the kitchen (all of the bathrooms have new floors which were installed a few months ago).  The verdict?  The linoleum is a go and it will actually be installed tomorrow.  The cost is $250 for the linoleum and glue and $200 for my friend to install it.  Tile was way beyond our budget, and the carpet for the entire house will cost considerably more--about $2000 even with a discount on the installation--so this is a project that will wait until next year.I was bored with my home office so instead of buying stuff to make it more interesting, I decided to move in to one of the guest rooms (we had already sold the bed and furniture in there in anticipation of moving).  The decor had an Indian theme so all I really needed to do was move my desk and office stuff and now it looks like a totally new office with exactly zero cost.The \"office\" I moved out of was actually the formal dining room which we never use, so it has been my office for the last few years.  With this room now empty room, I went \"shopping\" around the house and decided to move a futon/sofa in there, add a variety of decor taken from other rooms (a book case, framed art, a big plant, etc) and now my friend calls it \"the meditation room.\"  Two rooms completed without having spent a dime.Our bedroom was the next room we tackled.  I bought a new comforter with bed skirt and pillow shams for $25 at Ross.  I was shocked to find this set because a similar set I wanted cost $175 at Macy's (I am super picky about how the comforter feels--no polyester fabric that \"sparks\" when you move it, no rough fabric, etc).  We also decided to find a sofa for the sitting portion of our bedroom because we literally live in this room about 75% of the time, especially in the winter when it just makes financial sense to keep our bedroom heated and turn the furnace down to 55 for the rest of the house.  There were lots of choices but all of them were at the $599 price range and up.  At the last store we went to, we found the perfect love seat which was big enough but not too big.  It was originally priced a $599, it was then clearance priced at half off ($298) and that day, it just so happened that the store was having a 50% off clearance sale which brought the price down to about $150.  Score.  All of the wall decor and drapes were found/traded with other rooms in the house.We wanted to focus on updating the kitchen the most because this is where people look when buying a house (we still hope to sell in the future).  Since our kitchen looks \"dated\" (nothing has changed since the house was built 20 years ago), we decided to spend most of our money on this room.  With the floor taken care of, we decided to get all new appliances.  We ordered a new refrigerator, range, dishwasher, and range hood.  We went bargain shopping on these purchases as well.  Besides buying at the lower end (we need to fill the dishwasher space with a dishwasher yet we rarely ever use it so basically it is an expensive dish drainer), the hood was of the $150 variety which looks pretty much like the $500 model, the range/oven was a range I really liked at $399 instead of the higher priced models, and the refrigerator was a basic side by side that will work fine for us--it has the water/crushed ice, etc--that we like.  We decided to go with white appliances instead of stainless which everyone told us to get for two reasons--my friend who sells appliances said you need to use special cleaner to keep the stainless looking good and he said I would have to get all of the appliances in the same brand because the color of the stainless varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.  Since stainless costs considerably more and because the appliances I chose were of different brands, that wouldn't have worked.  Finally, I was able to buy the appliances when they were on sale at 20% off, and add my friend's employee discount (10% more off), and use my friend's credit card (another 5% off...of course I gave him the cash for the purchase).  We were able to spend less than $1400 on all of the appliances not counting the money we will make by selling our old appliances on CraigsList AND the additional rebates we will get from our local electric utility which currently has rebates for the refrigerator and dishwasher.  The only other things we need to do is power wash the concrete (basketball court, driveway, and walk ways) with a borrowed power washer from a friend.  Power wash and repaint the deck (it seriously needs it!) which I will do so the only cost will be the paint, and do some landscaping (I would love to hire this done but will probably be out of money by then so I plan to do one section of the yard at a time myself...I guess it will be good exercise but I am not much of a gardener).The bottom line, financially speaking, is that if you want to do your own renovations, try \"shopping\" from what you already have.  Simply moving items from room to room will give your home a whole new look for no outlay of cash.  If you really must buy stuff, be sure to shop sales (preferably of the 50% off clearance type).  Obviously we could have saved money by buying used items either from the local thrift store or from CraigsList but I wanted new appliances that will last for quite a while and the love seat was a semi-extravagant purchase but I figured that it would hold enough value to be able to be sold on CraigsList for half of the purchase price while the more expensive sofas would have dropped from a $600 purchase price to a \"used\" price of about $100-$150 immediatly.I'll end this post now because I have to get up early tomorrow morning and get everything out of the kitchen before the flooring guys get here which includes removing the dishwasher.  Since I didn't want to pay $149 to have the \"professionals\" do this, I Googled \"how to remove a dishwasher\" and plan to do it myself...this should be interesting..."},
{"title": "July 1st--Today is the Start of a Few New Things", "date": "Thursday, July 1, 2010", "text": "There's a few new things happening today, July 1st, including:A new banking regulation goes into affect beginning today where you need to opt in or out of overdraft protection.  On a side note, a reader pointed out that banks are now looking at ending free checking in order to generate more revenue.If you were born in Puerto Rico, a new law goes into affect today where you need to apply for a new tamper-proof birth certificate.While I am not much of a Suze Orman fan, I saw this article where she tells everyone to start paying cash for everything and wanted to give her a high five!Finally, I choose today as the start for my new diet/exercise program.  I am slowly chipping away at my goal list and decided to make a doctor's appointment for my complete physical which I haven't done in about three years.  The reason I haven't done this?  I am chubby :(  For most of my life I have been a size 2 or 4 but since I switched from working out three to four hours a day first as a gymnast then as a dancer, to a pretty non-active career of sitting in meetings and hacking away at my computer for hours on end, the weight has been slowly creeping up on me.  Now my size 8 pants are tight and while most people wouldn't think that's a problem, I do.  And the reason for all of this is my lack of exercise and crappy diet.  So my doctor's appointment is 47 days away and my challenge is to exercise two hours a day and eat only healthy food for 47 days.  In the past I have tried to change my diet and the amount of exercise I get but always became side-tracked either by a crazy schedule or the fact that the changes were going to be forever.  Forever is a long time!  So this time I figured with a set deadline, I can certainly keep up with these two changes for 47 days (and hopefully by then a new habit of healthiness will have set in).  I will record my progress then post it as one complete blog post at the end of my challenge so as not to bore all of you with daily postings of what I ate and how many minutes I did on the treadmill."},
{"title": "Community Events--Great FREE Entertainment", "date": "Monday, June 28, 2010", "text": "Yesterday the hubby and I went to the Seattle Pride Parade. This was a really fun event that also happened to be free! One of the best ways to save money on entertainment is to go to free community events which are generally hosted throughout the summer where we live. Besides getting lots of pictures at the parade, we also netted lots of handouts that the parade participants were giving to the crowd including: a Macy's scarf, a half dozen strings of beads, a handful of stickers, a bottle of Vitamin water, candy, a bunch of condoms (it was the Gay Pride Parade...safe sex and stuff you know...), a T shirt, and coupons.  Overall a good haul and amusing entertainment!"},
{"title": "Money Saving Tips I Gave a Friend (Which May Help You Too)", "date": "Saturday, June 26, 2010", "text": "I met up with a friend yesterday and in the process of our conversation I gave him some tips to help him save money which I then figured could probably help others as well.  My friend is a great guy, unfortunately he has had a pretty messed up life (drugs, alcohol, in a biker gang...yikes).  Fortunately over the past five or six years, he has really pulled himself together.  Now he is sober, sincere, employed in a legitimate job, bought a house...just an amazing succession of events that a decade ago, no one, least of all him, would have thought possible.  To say I am so proud of him is an understatement.  He did this literally one step at a time...join AA, get sober, ditch the old \"friends\", get new friends, start out at a pretty lousy job but do your best anyway, get a better job, bank his income, save for a down payment...basically all of the things that one is supposed to do to succeed but which people, especially those with drug and alcohol problems, don't do which leads them to a life of chaos and usually jail.  So anyway, while everything is coming along pretty good for him, he does still have some minor financial issues and like everyone else, could use some extra money in his pocket at the end of the week.  These were my suggestions:His house is financed at 6%+ with more than 25 years left to pay.  I suggested he refinance his house (interest rates are around 4.5% now) and chop the term down to 20 or even 15 years.  Even though he shortens up the term of the loan, the payments shouldn't be too much more than he is paying now because of the drop in interest rate and because he would be cutting off years of interest payments.His employer will pay for a metro transit pass for him each month.  Currently he drives to work, and pays for insurance, parking, and gas.  Since he lives on the bus line, I explained that taking the bus can be a much better option than driving.  The pass would be free, he could save parking fees, possibly lower his insurance, and could possibly even get rid of one of the family cars.  Even though he would have to get up a bit earlier to ride the bus, this would give him a bit of exercise when walking to the bus stop, he read or play with his smart phone on the way to work, and the bus would drop him off practically at the doorstep of his office.He added that he was waiting for his girlfriend to get off of work so they could go out to dinner since it was her payday.  I can totally understand wanting to reward yourself for a couple of weeks of hard work, but the restaurant they were going to go to is expensive!  I suggested that they keep up their every other week date night but that they choose a cheaper alternative.  The hubby and I used to eat out every day, for nearly every meal.  Now we eat out maybe once every two weeks or so and we usually end up splitting a $5 subway or going to Wendy's for a baked potato and chili ($4 for the two of us).  I know from experience that cutting back on eating out has saved us a ton of money.He still has debt.  IRS debt, legal debt, and some old credit debt.  Currently he is paying the minimum on these debts and feeling overwhelmed.  Making the minimum payments on debt can make you feel overwhelmed and make your efforts feel futile because often the minimum payment barely covers the interest charge.  I told him we have been able to pay off quite a bit of debt over the last couple of years by picking the smallest debt and hammering away at it.  We have had garage sales, sold gold, sold furniture...basically anything we could do to get extra money to throw at our debts (smallest to largest).  This has helped us pay off debts much faster than we ever thought possible.Since he has turned his life around, he has been free of the legal system for more than five years.  I can't begin to figure out how much money this has saved him.  Even minor legal problems usually end up with court costs, attorney fees, fines, etc.  He told me how one year, when he first started getting his life back together, he didn't have any way to pay his fines so the judge let him work off all of his court fees...to the tune of over 900 hours in community service.  Wow.  For quite a few months his full time job was community service and his part time job paid his minimal living expenses.  Avoiding legal problems all together is a much better option and saves quite a bit of money.My friend has goals.  When I first met him, he had a low wage job that barely paid his bills.  At the time, he had a goal to get a job with a major employer in our area.  I didn't even think it was possible because of his comprehensive and lengthy police record but he kept his goal in mind while he worked towards the things he needed...good references in the community, a couple of years of good work history, no police problems, etc...and before you know it he had an entry level job with this company.  Now after about three years he has got raises and better jobs within the company at a startling pace.  Amazing.Overall my friend is doing really well and I am really proud of him.  With a few more tweeks to his already pretty good life, he should find his way out of debt and he should end up with more money than he ever dreamed possible."},
{"title": "10 Tips for Saving Money on Tech Stuff", "date": "Friday, June 25, 2010", "text": "Since I am squeezing every last penny out of my dollars these days, and since I love technology--the newer the better--I have had to come up with a bunch of ways to get my tech fix on the cheap. Here's some tips...Software can be expensive. Fortunately, there is a lot of good (cheap/free) software available online. For good deals on software, check out OpenOffice (a free and pretty good alternative to MS Office) and Download (all kinds of software; check out their top 25 downloads list first. This is where I get my AdAware pop-up blocker and AVG anti virus software for free).  Of course, scoring free apps from the iTunes store is also a good thing (I love the free Soduko app I recently downloaded).The new Apple iPhone 4 is all the rage now. Unfortunately, my tight budget won't cover a new iPhone ($300+) and the monthly service contract that goes with it ($100+). So my cheaper alternative is to have a T Mobile phone (with an old contract, it is $49 for two lines each month) and an iTouch which I can use online where ever there is free wi-fi. My cell phone does allow me to access the internet in a pinch but it is really slow and doesn't have very much of a web browser but for the cost savings, my two-piece system will need to work until I get out of debt. Depending on what we do in the future, we may switch to a pre-paid plan like the $25 per month plan from Virgin Mobile which gives you a few hundred minutes plus unlimited text and internet.Phone service options have really exploded in the past decade. You used to have a hard wired phone in your home and that was your only option. These days you can cancel the home phone all together and just use your cell phone and/or use a VoIP service like Skype to make free or really cheap calls to anywhere in the world. I have phone service bundled with my internet for a really low price and since I use this for my business phone I am pretty happy with it but if I didn't call much (and lived in a place where my cell phone got better reception) I would just use a cell phone for all of my calls.International communication options. I have a lot of friends spread all over the world but paying for phone cards to call them can get spendy. What I do now is use Chikka to text message my friends in Asia (for free) to their cell phones. Email is a given, of course, and I also use email to text to my friend's international cell phones as well. Yahoo chat is a great (free) option and, of course Skype works great for calling overseas and is cheap too.Do you need a website? I do need a handful of websites which I pay for each month (Webhero is my choice and although it isn't super cheap, their tech help is super awesome). The best news in websites these days is that there are so many free platforms for setting up your own sites (which by the way, you can usually add Google Adsense to and make some money from your efforts!). My favorites are Blogger and Tumblr, however FaceBook and MySpace are popular options too.Tech hardware like computers and big screen TVs are nice to have but can be real budget breakers. We generally opt to go with the cheapest item that will meet our needs. Because technology changes so fast, it just doesn't make sense to pay top dollar for an item that will be obsolete within a few years. That's why my laptop cost $499 (I don't do heavy-duty gaming or number crunching so this average system works great for me) and my 46\" TV cost under $400 (on sale of course). Yes, some people want high end tech because it is supposed to be so much better but in a couple of years you could still be paying off your expensive TV and it won't even be worth what the cheapest TV in the store is worth.I always look for bargains. I was thrilled to learn my non profit could get excellent software (MS Office, a full Photoshop suite) for pennies on the dollar through TechSoup. I never buy stuff like computers, TVs, or my most recent prize, an iTouch unless it is on sale. A really good sale. In the case of the iTouch, I know they never come on sale but a local store had a 10% off any item in the store coupon which I used to get the iTouch.  Finding online bargains for tech items at places such as CraigsList, eBay, or just Googling the item and getting a list of prices are other ways to get great deals on your tech stuff.We have a GPS device for our car...but it hasn't been updated in a few years.  We originally got a GPS device when it was on a close out table (about $75).  Since it was already a year out of date, we got a good price on it.  The catch with these things, however, is that the company usually offers a yearly update which includes new maps...for a price of about $89.  Needless to say, we will just buy another close out GPS when the maps get so out of date that the device becomes unusable; fortunately roads pretty much remain the same from year to year unless you are trying to find a new housing development.  This has happened a couple of times, but not so often that we feel the need to upgrade.  Plus, this has saved us the cost of our annual AAA membership which we used to have mostly for their wonderful maps when we drove long distances.We always wait for technology to come down to a price we want to pay.  Hubby did once pay nearly $1000(!) for a VCR when they first came on the market, but since then, we don't need anything that bad that we can't wait for the price to drop.  As camcorders got smaller, the prices didn't automatically get cheaper.  On a few vacations, we had the bigger, clunkier camcorder when our friends had the super streamlined (yet still $500+) camcorders.  Now that the little \"Webbie\" camcorders can be had for around $100 on sale, I am happy to report that our camcorder can now be hauled around in a pocket.We have moved past the point of keeping up with everyone else.  Right now, for example, nearly everyone I work with raves about the Kindle.  I just can't see paying that much for an item that can only do one thing (plus you have to pay for the books too).   I have, however, been able to download some free ebooks onto my iTouch and I just found Project Gutenberg which should allow me to download even more free books.  The same goes for stereo equipment, new appliances, new cars...basically anything the Joneses have, I am going to think twice about getting (and if I do decide to get it, it will be for a rock bottom price).The bottom line is that there are always alternatives for the things you want and need.  A little research and a little creativity can stretch your budget further than you thought possible.p.s.  My \"blogger butt\" was getting out of control so that picture you see above is my new solution to this problem.  I heard that standing burns more calories than sitting all day so I put the chair away and raised up my computer (on a stack of books from my bookshelf...a nice free option).  I'll let you know how this works out..."},

{"title": "The True Cost of Material Goods", "date": "Saturday, June 19, 2010", "text": "I have been so focused on paying off debt over the past few months that I haven't really bought anything but necessities such as food and gas.  Fast forward to yesterday when I got a new iTouch.  A client usually gives me a nice bonus each year of my choosing.  Past items have included laptops, netbooks, and other cool stuff (thank you client!).  So this year the boss lady is all happy about getting an iPhone and suggested I would like one too.  In fact, she said this would be my bonus for this year if I wanted one.  After some deliberation, I asked for an iTouch instead due to the fact that I didn't want to be stuck paying the monthly phone service fee.  An iTouch is a \"buy it one time and you don't have monthly fees\" item so I was really happy with my decision.  Today, while I am super pleased with my new toy (I was surfing the web at Barnes and Noble this afternoon at lightening speed!), I also realized that most material goods, even free ones, aren't really free.  Here's why:After I got my iTouch, I bought one for hubby.  I figured we could both use these, especially when we travel, and like most of our stuff, we each use the same items at the same time so we tend to have duplicates of everything (laptops, netbooks, cameras, etc).  This also happens in families where you buy one kid an item and then you end up buying the same item for all of the kids.  This can get expensive.There's so much packaging.  Since we haven't bought much lately, I have noticed that we have lots less garbage.  We even dropped down to garbage service every other week instead of weekly.  Buying stuff means you have to throw out a lot of packaging, wrapping, etc.There are related items that you often end up buying to support/care for/add to said item.  In this case, I needed to get us cases for the iTouches and new headphones for me (I hate things stuffed in my ears).  The costs are starting to add up...Then there are the additional \"subscription-type\" things that go with many of today's electronics.  In this case, it is the iTunes app store.  Even though I have only loaded free apps, you can't even sign into the app store without giving them your credit card number or buying an iTunes gift card.  I bought us each a $15 gift card because that was the lowest domination they had so that is another big expense.Then there is upkeep.  While I declined the extended warranty, I am guessing that others pay this fee.Then there is the need to protect your new item.  I certainly don't want to drop this fragile-looking $300 toy.  There is also the risk of having it stolen too.Finally, each new item you get can take up something just as important as your money and that is your time.  So far I have spent hours programming, syncing, and checking out apps for the iTouch.  Then I needed to teach hubby how everything works since he is less than technologically savvy.  So I guess time also needs to be a consideration when adding new material good to my life.I can totally understand why people \"go minimalist.\"  It is a lot less work, a lot less expense, and a lot less stuff to worry about.  Even though I am a huge fan of technology and before I used to shop like I was practicing for an Olympic event, these days I am pretty content to have less.  Less stuff to pay for, less stuff to clean/program/upgrade/maintain, and less stuff that takes up my time."},

{"title": "10 Things to Do Now...In Case Your Husband Leaves You", "date": "Saturday, June 12, 2010", "text": "It's been a sad few months for a couple of friends who are in the middle of getting divorced. Besides being emotionally devastated, they are basically financially devastated as well. Here's some stuff I learned from them as well as from a handful of women I know whose husbands died suddenly, ended up in a coma/in the trauma center for months, lost their jobs (when the husband was the sole breadwinner), and otherwise went off the rails leaving the women to basically fend for themselves.p.s. Obviously these tips work just as much for men as for women, I just thought the title was catchy.Have your own emergency fund with a minimum of $2000 in it. Not your family emergency fund, not the \"my husband has plenty of money\" emergency fund, not the \"I have plenty of credit cards\" emergency fund. You want $2000 CASH in a secure bank account that you can easily access.Have all of your important documents in a secure place where you can easily access them. These documents include drivers license, passport, birth certificate, marriage certificate, divorce decree, death certificate, mortgage deed of trust, car titles...basically all of the official documents available for your immediate family.Have an education. There are quite a few women that will get a high school diploma and stop their education. They will ensure their husbands get through college, they will focus all of their attention on their children's education, but they put off completing their own education and then when they end up on their own and could really use these credentials, they don't have them. Get at least a bachelor's degree even if it means you take one class per quarter for ten year. Of course, you will want to cash-flow your education and not take out student loans.Have some money-earning skills. Whether you dabble in website design or resell stuff on Craigslist, having the ability to earn money is vital to your continued well being whether or not your income is needed to support the family.Have a network of friends. Many times women get so focused on their husbands and kids that they let their friendships lapse because they don't have the time or energy to sustain them. When all Hell breaks loose, you will be thankful for the support of your good friends.Be debt free. If you end up on your own, you don't want to also be bogged down by a pile of debts that need to be paid each month. Your monthly bills should be minimal (cell phone, utilities, etc) and your consumer debt should be zero.Insist that your spouse if debt free as well. If something happens to your spouse, you could be left with all of his debts (this happened to one of my friends. When her husband died suddenly, instead of having time to grieve his death, she was immediately barraged by debt collectors). This is also important if you get divorced--your spouse can be given the debts by the court but that doesn't mean he will pay them and the debt collectors will come after YOU.Live in a reasonably-sized house. You don't need a McMansion to have a nice home. Having a house that one income can easily support is really important in the event that YOUR income ends up being the one paying for your home and utilities.Know how much your spouse makes, how much the monthly bills are, how the family money is invested, the information for all bank accounts, what kinds of insurance policies your family has, know what each line of your last tax return means, what pensions/retirement plans your husband has, what kind of health insurance you have, and, most importantly, have all of this information written down somewhere in case you end up paying the bills if a spouse suddenly dies or your divorce attorney needs a place to start looking for assets.Learn how to do everything your husband does even if it seems confusing, boring, or icky. Your husband may not always be around to fix the plumbing, mow the yard, do your annual taxes, or DVR your favorite shows. The more you know how to do, the better off you will be in the end.Hopefully your marriage lasts forever and you are able to grow old with a loving spouse but that doesn't always happen. More often than not, when a marriage ends either by divorce of death, the spouse that is left behind ends up grieving the end of the relationship while at the same time trying to deal with creditors, messed up plumbing, paying bills, raising the kids, and the multitude of other things that before took two people to accomplish."},
{"title": "10 Financial Tips for New High School Grads", "date": "Wednesday, June 9, 2010", "text": "Although I don't know anyone who is graduating from high school this year (a few people I know graduated last year and a couple of friend's kids will be graduating next year), I nonetheless want to share these ten financial tips that I wish someone would have shared with me when I was graduating from high school.Do not get a credit card! If you need to use plastic, put money into your bank account and use your bank-issued ATM card which has a Visa or Mastercard logo on it in order to swipe your purchases. This tip alone would have saved me many thousands of dollars over the years. Do not go to college unless you can pay for it without loans. Most people think this is impossible but it isn't and if you graduate with a degree and zero debt you will be one happy grad. Apply for every scholarship possible, go to your local community college for your first two years and work to pay for college as you go, then switch to a state school or online degree program with a reputable university and PAY AS YOU GO.If you want a car, save the money and pay cash for it. Better yet, use public transportation or ride your bike and save the expense and hassle of owning a car.Stay as far away from any debt, especially contract debt, as possible. A pre-paid cell plan will keep you from getting a huge surprise bill some day. Renting a room from a friend is better than tying yourself down to an expensive apartment lease. Payday lender loans are just stupid. The only time you should acquire debt is to buy a house (and only then with a 25% down payment).Save 10% of every dime you earn for your old age. This is in addition to other money you are saving for different things like cars, houses, etc.Work through high school, save your money, and travel the world after you graduate. There is no better time to travel and expand your horizons than right after high school. You become independent, your open mind is opened even wider by world travel, and you will not be tied down by a spouse/kids/mortgage/serious job/etc. that you will have when you are older.Stay away from financial entanglements. This includes but is not limited to: co-signing loans for anyone, loaning people money, gambling, \"get rich quick schemes\", etc.Stay away from social entanglements that could land you in financial (and other) trouble. This includes but is not limited to: having babies (18 is too young!), getting married (if you are really in love, why not wait a couple of years?), DUIs (plain stupid and really expensive), other illegal stuff (like drug use, assaults, etc).About work...everyone has crappy jobs when they are young. You don't want to take your job SO seriously but you do want to have a good attitude and work ethic and use each job as an opportunity to learn new skills and work on new projects. However, don't let your job stop you from exploring other places, traveling, taking another job that may be more interesting, etc.About boyfriends/girlfriends...when you are young (and to us old people, 18 is young), people tend to think their boyfriend/girlfriend is the be all and end all. Because of their relationships they will do all kinds of stuff that can negatively impact them both financially and otherwise. Never let your relationship stop you from achieving your goals. At this point in your life, YOU are the most important person in your life (which will change when you have kids). This means that you do take opportunities that come along (a great full ride scholarship at a school across the country), and you don't make yourself responsible for the other person (if I had a quarter for every girl I knew who supported their boyfriend, gave their boyfriend a cell phone/clothes/money, didn't take an opportunity because of their boyfriend, co-signed for their boyfriends loan and got stuck with it, bailed their boyfriend out of jail...you get the idea...I would be RICH!).How do I know all of this stuff? Simple, I made ALL of these mistakes. By the time I graduated from high school I had a wallet full of credit cards (most on their way to being maxed out), student loans, and an expensive car (with payments of course), other debts (apartment lease). I would spend every penny I made and save nothing, took my first jobs way too seriously, was engaged to my boyfriend, loaned people money/bailed them out of jail/co-signed for people...basically if there was a stupid money mistake to be made, I made it. Needless to say, starting out in sinkhole of debt (and the continued money mistakes) took years to fix (I'm still fixing my mistakes but making good progress). Graduating from high school is literally the beginning of the whole rest of your life. Take this opportunity to make good choices, start off on a good financial footing, and give yourself the gift of a solid foundation for your later years. And congrats for graduating high school!"},

Yikes.I can count the number of clothing items I bought in the last couple of months on one hand. I used to think I needed a new outfit nearly every day of the week (and I have the massive amount of credit card receipts to prove it!).We haven't been to the movies in...I can't remember how long. Ditto with video rentals. With hundreds of stations on TV, I can be patient until movies come out on cable.No more subscriptions! I used to subscribe to magazines, newspapers, the gym...having a steady amount of money being pulled out of my account monthly for things I may or may not even use was a waste of money.I don't own a car! This simple change in my life made the biggest positive financial impact on my life ever. I wish I would have known about this 25 years ago--I would probably be a millionaire by now!I don't have/use credit cards any more. Again, if I would have known how much money I could have saved over the years by spending cash only I would have been a millionaire (again!).I don't take all of the travel opportunities that come along, unfortunately. I love to travel but since I am using cash only and we are paying down debts, I have to control myself and decline all of the great vacations that family and friends invite us to (Las Vegas and Hawaii this month). Unfortunately I will be sitting at home paying off our debts...No more designer purses and shoes. This is sad and I love designer purses and shoes but I just can't see spending $500 on ONE ITEM that I will use for a while then sell on eBay for a fraction of the price I paid for it.No smart phone. I am also sad about this because EVERYONE has a smart phone that provides internet, music, games, and lots of fun stuff at their fingertips but I just can not justify spending twice the rate for a smart phone plan compared to the basic plan for my regular cell phone (not to mention the cost of the new smart phone itself).We haven't been dancing in ages. From the age of 21 (actually 16 if I could get in without being carded) until about 38, we were in nightclubs nearly five days a WEEK! I love to dance but the cost of clothes, food, drinks (soda for the hubby and I since we don't drink so this wasn't a major cost for us) gas to get to the club, etc. was just huge when I look back and calculate how much we spent on this expensive hobby over the years.Random shopping. Many of my friends still shop a lot. Every time we go to a store, gift shop, or anywhere else that has a retail section, they feel like they need to buy something...anything. I am now just the opposite. I simply don't buy stuff on the spur of the moment anymore. If the item I am looking to buy hasn't been on my \"need to buy\" list for a while, I don't buy it. Trinkets are never on my \"need to buy\" list.We look at every bill and figure ways to cut it down. Cable=number of stations reduced. Garbage=reduced to twice a month collection. Auto insurance=reduced to liability only. You get the idea.No daily Starbucks runs. Actually I haven't had caffeine in quite a while but I do occasionally treat myself to a green tea frap but this isn't the daily/twice daily occurrence that it used to be.I take public transportation. It is much cheaper and pretty convenient and allows me to get a bit of exercise walking to/from the bus.I don't give people money any more. Friends and family used to hit me up for cash for everything from covering a cell bill to making a car payment just before their car gets repoed. The thing I learned, however, is that giving people money (or \"loaning\" it to them and never getting paid back) didn't actually help them. Two months later, they would be asking for money again for the very same thing!No more services for our home. We used to have a housekeeper and a gardener which I felt we \"deserved\" because we worked so hard (plus all of our friends had housekeepers and gardeners and we didn't want to be \"different\"). These days hubby and I share the house cleaning and lawn mowing chores.Gifts have been ratcheted WAY back. I used to buy gifts for all occasions for all friends and family (like a hundred people--we have a big family). Not only was this a big expense, but sometimes people wouldn't even say \"thank you\". Technology is nice but we don't need/want \"the best\". During the high-rolling '90s, I had to have every new technological item nearly the day it came on the market. These days I will wait and let both the bugs be worked out and the price to drop low enough that I can justify buying it.We don't fall for things designed to separate us from our money. Multi-level marketing programs, time shares, boats, etc. If something has a price attached, we almost always decline because we are so much more aware of our money and simply won't let one dollar get out of our grasp because we realize there may be no opportunity to \"pay for it later\" and the social pressure to buy to \"be like...and be liked...by everyone else\" is now non existent. If people don't like me the way I am...I DON'T CARE. I care about my financial stability and financial future.Overall our concept of money has changed drastically. We no longer spend like maniacs, charge stuff we can't afford, or think that budget is a bad word. Now, like Dave says, each dollar we earn has a name and a purpose before we even get our paychecks.I can't wait until the day I can \"live like everyone else\". Of course I will blog about it here too!"},
{"title": "The Magic of the Debt Snowball", "date": "Friday, June 4, 2010", "text": "When I first started paying off my debts, I did as Dave Ramsey suggested and figured I would attack them with the debt snowball.  I listed my debts smallest to largest then proceeded to pay off the smallest debt with any extra money I could get ahold of.  Meanwhile, I was making the payments on all of my other debts too.  At first I thought this method would take FOREVER.  I mean, it took months of adding an extra $100 to my smallest $500 balance credit card--five months just to be able to pay off one credit card--which seemed at the time to be the slow and depressing way to pay off debt.Fast forward to today when we only have a couple of hubby's credit cards to pay off before becoming completely debt free except for the house.  Since all of the smaller debts have been paid off using the debt snowball, ALL extra money can be put towards one of his two remaining credit credit cards while we continue to make the minimum payment on the last card.  Because we don't have a dozen debts to pay on each month like we had in the beginning we can literally make monthly payments of $1,500 to $2,000, and sometimes even more, on the second to last card while still paying the minimum on the last credit card.  I walked into the bank a week ago to make a payment on the second to last card, handing the teller a check for $2000.  She asked if it was a deposit into our checking account and I said no, it was for the credit card.  She did a double take at the amount but didn't say anything else.  Guess they know now we are serious about getting out of debt!So the message to everyone just starting out with the debt snowball is that yes, when you first start with this process, it will seem slow, but as you knock out each debt and add the money you would have used to pay on the last credit card to the next one on your list, you will be able to make larger and larger payments.  Pretty soon, instead of adding an extra $50 or $100 to your debt payment, you will be about to add an extra $500 to $1000 or more and get yourself out of debt forever (just remember to cancel each card as you pay it off)!"},

{"title": "Chicago Challenge: Part 2", "date": "Saturday, May 29, 2010", "text": "Here's a run down on the rest of our trip to Chicago...and a picture of a bear at the Lincoln Park Zoo.Day 4 (Thursday): $29.46 spentI did have to do some work during the trip, so most of today was spent in conference sessions. Generally at these events, they load us up with food. Breakfast was free!A plate lunch was offered which would have been free but I wanted to eat lunch with hubby so we went across the river from our hotel to what looked like a hole in the wall restaurant and found what was actually a huge food court. I had some luscious Mediterranean food at the Olive Mediterranean Grill and hubby had Popeye's chicken. Cost for both of us was $11.45.I grabbed a bag of donut holes at Dunkin Donuts on the way back to the conference at a cost of $1.10 (the guy at the counter remembered me and he actually gave me double the amount that I was supposed to receive!).Our CTA pass was going to expire this afternoon so we hopped on the L and took a run over to the Chicago Public Library. This is a beautiful, huge library with interesting architecture and, of course, lots to read at a cost of FREE.Dinner was some amazingly heart-attack-on-a-plate delicious soul food at Ronny's Original Chicago Steak House which was a few blocks from our hotel. I had kind of given up getting any sort of soul food because I thought we would have to go to the South side of Chicago and we just didn't have time. Fortunately we looked into this cafeteria-style restaurant, saw that it was packed with people, and, following our cardinal rule of restaurant finding, decided to go in. The food was great! Cost for two was a mere $10.24 (including a T bone steak dinner for hubby!).After a very big meal, we decided to get some exercise by walking around the downtown area. They have just about every type of store you could ever want to find here! We did a lot of window shopping and I had to gush over the Jimmy Choo shoes and some beautiful Louboutin heels (Nordstrons has the most AMAZING shoe section) but at nearly $900 per pair...well I didn't actually buy anything because paying off our debt is way more important than a pair of shoes (the opposite of what I would have though just a few short years ago).We picked up some more steamed buns at WowBao for a late night snack for $6.67.Day 5 (Friday): $38.20 spentOn our final day in Chicago I had breakfast free at the conference then cut out early to make our flight back home.We picked up a six-pack of WowBaos to take with us to eat on the plane later at a cost of $9.65.Since our metro pass was expired, we paid the one way fare to O'Hare which cost $4.50 for both of us. We got to the airport and found that not only was the flight later than I thought (um, remind me to actually check the tickets instead of trying to remember a reservation I made months ago), and that the flight was out of a DIFFERENT AIRPORT! As panic set in I considered our options...changing our tickets to fly out of O'Hare instead of Midway would cost $500(!)...um, no. A taxi would cost about $45. We decided to race across town...well race as fast as the \"L\" would go...in order to get to the Midway Airport.So we paid another fare of $5 for both of us to ride the \"L\" back into the city then transfer to another train to take us Midway. Fortunately we arrived with time to spare.Our plane was delayed for over an hour and a half so we missed our connecting flight. Fortunately we were able to catch a flight that left a couple hours later.Hubby had a hot dog at the airport for $5...which seems like a lot for a hot dog. Which is why we almost always pack food with us when we travel on airplanes. But we didn't plan to be traveling for nearly 10 hours.We made it back home and I am happy to report that the total we spent for the entire five day trip was $195.84!! Over one hundred dollars less than we planned to spend!! Actually holding to a tight budget for a vacation was something I had never really considered (we usually just spend then sort out the bills later). Thanks to the idea inspired by Young Mogul, hubby said this was one of the best vacations he had been on because we were continually challenging ourselves to find interesting free things to do, decent food at rock bottom prices, and we were more open to random inspirations (like giving our leftovers that we might otherwise have thrown away to the homeless guy that sits on the Dearborn Street bridge every morning...like following groups of school kids around the zoo and being more amused by them than the animals...like looking at contemporary art when we don't even like contemporary art but it was free entertainment). We saved lots of money (hmm...the $355 per diem check will way more than cover our expenses), spent cash only, and were entertained in ways that were heavy on the \"fun and adventure\" and light on the spending. Most of the people that I knew at the conference must have spent well over $2000 each...they went shopping daily, went to a game at Wrigley Field, did a dinner cruise, and and hit all of the hot bars in the city. Hubby asked if I missed that sort of thing which is something we would have joined in with a few years ago, but I really didn't. Either did he."},
{"title": "Chicago Travel Challenge: Part 1", "date": "Wednesday, May 26, 2010", "text": "I was reading the Mogul in Training blog and she had done a challenge to spend only a certain amount on her last vacation.  I have never really had a budget for a vacation before so I thought I would give it a try.This week the hubby and I are in Chicago because I am attending a conference for work.  A couple of days before we left, I sold a desk which I had on CraigsList (part of my $1500 challenge) however I had already reached the $1500 so didn't need the funds for that challenge so I thought I would take the $300 and see if we could keep our spending for five days to $300 or less for both of us.  A few things are working in our favor, namely the five star hotel we are staying in is paid for by a client (rant about these kinds of hotels below), airfare was also paid, we long ago got over buying souvenir trinkets, and, since we only travel with one carry on bag each, it is really hard to buy much because we would have no way to get the excess stuff back home.  I did a bit of research before we left to find out what (really cheap, preferably free) things there are to do in Chicago and was able to develop quite a list.  Here's how our money has been spent so far:Day 1 (Monday):  $56 spentTwo three-day CTA (bus/subway) passes $28 for both.  This is one of THE BEST investments we made for our trip.  With this pass, you can use any bus or subway for an unlimited amount of trips for 72 hours.  We have been literally all over Chicago using these passes so this already saved us a bunch of money (and hassle) over using a rental car.Dunkin Donuts, $2.  This is my favorite donut place and we don't have this on the West Coast so a necessary splurge.$4 for a two litres of pop and bottled water for the hotel room.  Using the mini-bar is insane because the prices are so high so we go to the local corner store and buy beverages for the room at a fraction of the price.KenKee Restaurant, $22 for both of us.  We went to Chinatown and looked into the windows of restaurants until we found one packed with local Chinese people.  This is a sure-fire way to find a good restaurant because if all of the locals eat there, it is pretty much guaranteed that they have good food and good prices.  We weren't disappointed--the food was excellent!Day 2 (Tuesday):  $25.55 spentWe headed to REI because they had a big sale and this could have been a budget buster but I couldn't find anything I really needed so we just looked but didn't buy.  Free.Next we hopped on the subway to Greektown and went to Mr Greek Gyros for lunch (another place packed to the gills with people during lunch).  $14 bought us a huge helping of rib tips and rice and a huge gyro and fries.  Excellent food, huge portions, and great prices!I gave $1 to a guy who was singing and playing his guitar in the subway.  A good price to pay for 10 minutes of good entertainment.We then hopped on the subway again and went to window shop at the Magnificent Mile--Macy's, Saks, and dozens of other stores that are incredibly expensive.  Bought nothing so this cost 0.The Museum of Contemporary Art was right down the street from the Magnificent Mile and it was FREE today.  We wandered around in a nice air conditioned gallery and checked out the (decidedly odd in my opinion) artwork.  Across the street was the Northwestern School of Law.  I wanted a sweatshirt from the school but we didn't feel like walking to the other end of the campus in the heat so this stop cost nothing.A Starbucks stop cost $5.35 for both of us.We discovered WowBao which produces great Asian buns in this same area.  $3 for two buns.We finished up with a lite dinner at The Dog Joint in Lincoln Park (we had headed over to the zoo but it was closed), so dinner cost $5.20 for both of us (a hot dog for hubby and a hot dog with all the fixins, hold the hot dog, for me).Leftovers from earlier today was the perfect late night snack for hubby, cost, free.A beautiful fireworks show provided evening entertainment for about 30 minutes and it was right outside out hotel window in the middle of the river so we didn't even have to leave our room to watch it!  Free!Day 3 (Wednesday):  $46.63 spentWe hit the subway early this morning so we could be at the Lincoln Park Zoo when it opened.  Apparently every other school kid in Chicago did the same--I have never seen so many kids in one place at one time!  The zoo was great--clean and lots of animals to look at and photograph.  Best of all, this attraction was FREE!Lunch was in Chinatown where we broke our cardinal rule of restaurant finding and went to a restaurant that had no people in it.  The food wasn't all that great unfortunately. $15 for two lunches that were only so-so.$1 went to a lady who was singing in the subway--she had a beautiful voice!  Here name is Miss Flow she has a website.$4 for a Starbucks during a break at the conference I was attending (bad habit, I know).After looking over the entirety of Greektown for a place for dinner, the only restaurant that was packed was Mr Greek's so we went here again--a spanokopita dinner complete with rice, salad, and bread and a pork chop dinner for hubby cost $15.10 for both of us.$1.10 for Dunkin Donuts (again) to bring back to the room for dessert.$10.43 for a six pack of bao from WowBao which will be a late night snack.And a short rant:  I pretty much detest 5-star hotels, even when someone else is paying for it.  Give me a nice Comfort Inn type hotel any day.  At least with a mid-range hotels like a Comfort Inn or Quality Inn, they include free wi-fi, free exercise room, free parking, free pool, and even free breakfast!  Most 5-star hotels, like the one we are staying in, nickel and dime you to death!  Room, $250+, parking $15, internet $10 (per computer per day!!), health club $15, breakfast $10+.  Ayayay..."},

{"title": "The Financial Ramifications of Divorce", "date": "Saturday, May 22, 2010", "text": "Two of my good friends are getting divorced.  One just finished the process, however the financial disaster that was her marriage is now following her into her newly divorced life, and another just began the process--her husband filed for divorce nearly out of the blue (he gave her a couple weeks notice that he had found a new girlfriend) and now she is in panic mode because for the entirety of her 20+ year marriage she has not had to work.  Here's some things I have learned about divorce by following along with my friends as they have gone through this gut-wrenching process:During your divorce, the judge can award the debts to your spouse but that is no guarantee that your ex will pay the debts, and, since your name was probably on the debts as well, the debt collectors can come after YOU to collect.  From what I understand, if this should happen you can take the ex back to court because they are in contempt of the judge's order but that will take (a lot) of time AND your credit will already be ruined due to late payments/no payments of the debts.  My friend can't even qualify for a store credit card with a $100 limit because her ex decided to stop paying the debts and has told her he has no intention of paying them even if it is killing both of their credit scores.  What we can learn from this: ALWAYS be debt free in your marriage, this way there will be no debts to argue over in the divorce.If one spouse is awarded the house in the divorce, do not quit claim the house over to the ex until they refinance it.  There are have been quite a few instances where one spouse agrees that the other can have the house in the divorce so they just sign a quit claim deed and think they are done with the house.  Not true.  As long as both names are on the mortgage, both people will be responsible for the loan no matter who officially owns the house.  What we can learn from this: there are two ways to handle the house in a divorce, sell it and split the profit or have one person refinance the loan into their name.My friend has never had to work.  Her husband always had a very high paying job and they both agreed that she would stay home with the kids.  While she has done amazing things as a volunteer with community organizations, she has never earned money herself.  While she has always had a wallet full of credit cards at her disposal, she has never had to pay any bills as her husband always handled this.  Hopefully she will get a reasonable financial settlement (no guarantee of this in our state), but she is literally starting from square one when it comes to her financial life.  What we can learn from this: money is everyone's business in a marriage, the earning of it, the budgeting of it, and the spending of it.I can think of few things more terrifying then getting a sudden, \"I'm out of here\" from the spouse.  Obviously there is the emotional trauma from the sudden screeching halt to your marriage, but the other part of the equation, as happened to one of the friends I mentioned above, is that the husband walked out and she didn't even have enough money in her bank account to buy diapers for her baby.  What we can learn from this: EVERYONE needs their own emergency fund.  It is a simple process to open a bank account in your own name, put money into it little by little, and eventually build up a substantial amount of savings that would come in mighty handy in an emergency like a spouse leaving (or a killer vacation to celebrate your 50th wedding anniversary!). There are a whole bunch of details that need to be dealt with when a marriage ends, some of which can have drastic consequences on one or both parties.  Both friends lost their health insurance because their husband's policies provided their coverage.  One friend had to move to a tiny apartment because that is all she could afford, another divorced friend not mentioned above is struggling with paying for her kids soccer/braces/prom dresses/etc because her ex sends exactly the court ordered amount of child support and no more, and yet another friend divorced less than six months got involved with a new guy who basically took her for thousands of dollars (he was handsome, charming, manipulative, and chronically broke).  What we can learn from this: your lifestyle may take a nosedive so be prepared for that, take advantage of any community/social service that you qualify for based on your new financial status, plan ahead for future costs such as your kids braces and get this in the divorce agreement, and stay away from anyone who wants to part you from your money, you need it more than they do!Get everything in writing.  Both friends were promised many things from their (lying, cheating, guilt-ridden-at-the-time) husbands.  Unfortunately, as soon as they left and got with other women, both were suddenly overcome with amnesia to the point where neither remembered the promises they had made.  What we can learn from this: if there are agreements made verbally, they need to be written down and included in the divorce agreement.  Spoken agreements are basically worthless and a guilty person may promise a whole lot of things that they won't follow through with.It is often said that divorce turns a romantic relationship into a business proposition; a business proposition between two adversaries no less.  Everyone, no matter how loving and stable their relationship is, should take steps now to protect themselves financially in the event of divorce."},
{"title": "An Update...Or Rather Three Updates", "date": "Thursday, May 20, 2010", "text": "Feeling much better and now ready to rock my financials.  Here's the update:$1500 challenge.  I made it!  In addition to the $1000 I had collected in the previous update, I sold a gold bracelet that I never wore for $300 (not at a \"Cash for Gold\" place but to a local jeweler who pays much higher rates for salvage gold), and hubby won $200 at his weekly poker game so I did complete the challenge (and made my house payment) but I wouldn't recommend doing this with something as important as a house payment because it is TOO stressful.  Fortunately I didn't have to tap into the emergency fund to make the payment!  The best part is that hubby's credit card is half paid off and as soon as I get my bonus I will pay off the other half which was the whole catalyst for this challenge.The house sale.  Not so much good new here.  We have only had a few people look at the house since the end of the tax credit in April.  The house may also be priced a bit high for the market so we may end up just keeping it until the market values raise around here.  We aren't pressed to sell and we want to be able to make a reasonable profit so we will decide in June whether to pull it off the market for a while.  Once we do decide to keep it, we will begin doing some renovations including a new kitchen floor and new appliances and counter tops in the kitchen., which should make it both nice for us to enjoy while we live here and add some value for the next time we put it on the market.Travel.  I am heading to Chicago next week for a business trip (of course the hubby is tagging along as we always travel together).  We always have a budget, sort of, in mind for our travel but it is usually pretty flexible.  I read this post over at the Young Mogul blog and it gave me the idea to set a really tight budget for the trip and see if we can actually meet it.  So next week's posts will revolve around how to squeeze every penny out of our travel dollars.  I have already done a bit of research (Googling 'free things to do in Chicago') and found that there will be a Turkish Community Festival when we are there complete with free entertainment, a free day at the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, and free entrance to the National Museum of Surgical Science which should be interesting as well."},
{"title": "Under the Weather...And Some Frugal Tips for When You're Sick", "date": "Sunday, May 16, 2010", "text": "I've been feeling way under the weather this weekend which has both thrown off my $1500 challenge for a couple of days and relegated me to bed until I can get up without my head spinning.  Fortunately by this evening the fog is starting to clear.  Here's a bunch of tips I learned from my grandmother about how to take care of yourself when you are sick or have other maladies:If you have a cold or flu, sleep it off.  Sleep in a cool, dark room with the window open to let in fresh air while you are covered by a stack of blankets.  Come out when you feel better.For a headache, take a Tylenol or Ibuprofin.For diarrhea take acidophilous (it will repopulate the good bacteria in your stomach).For sunburn, cover the burned areas with Noxzema a couple of times a day; the burn will be gone in a couple of days.For cooking-type burns, run the burned area under cold water for a few minutes then break off the tip of your Aloe Vera plant and rub it on the wound.When you have the flu or a cold, lay off the dairy, sugar, flour, etc and eat clear soup (with vegies and a little meat).When you have the flu or a cold, drink lots of water and some ginger tea.If you feel illness coming on, double up on the Vitamin C.To keep mosquitoes at bay when out in the woods, take Vitamin B 12.If you are lacking energy, take Vitamin B complex.Do some kind of exercise or yard work every day to keep up your general health."},

{"title": "25 Free Things to Do When You are Bored", "date": "Thursday, May 13, 2010", "text": "Over the past few weeks, I have been holding onto my money so tightly it is practically screaming.  There have been no shopping trips to the mall, no meals out, no stops at Starbucks...basically every penny I have has a name and a purpose and frivolous spending is not happening (and won't happen until maybe sometime next month).  Although I don't have much time to be bored, chopping out all spending does open up some time in my day when I would otherwise be out shopping or hanging out at the mall.  Here's 25 (free) things I do when I'm bored:Go for a walk around the neighborhood.Go to the library.Hang out at Barnes and Noble reading books and magazines.Bake cookies at home.Take digital pictures (flowers are my favorite photography subject).Give myself a manicure, pedicure, and facial at home.Write (freelance articles, blog posts, emails to friends, etc).Call a friend just to chat.Volunteer at a local non profit.Follow along with an exercise on demand program on cable (usually yoga).Post something on Craigslist to sell.Surf the internet.Write in my journal (usually making plans for my future).Do a small project at home (wash the car, mow the yard, clean out a closet, etc).Try out new web apps (I'm kind of geeky that way).Attend a free community event (our local paper lists these things online each day).Watch a movie at home (usually on cable or from the library).Cook a gourmet dinner for my hubby.Watch TV (Judge Judy and the Dave Ramsey shows are my favorites).Practice Spanish (my Spanish verbs are still a jumbled mess!).Sit outside and look at the clouds (daytime) or stars (night time).Sing karaoke (we have a fairly comprehensive system at home).Walk along the beach and collect shells.Play Sudoku online.Cook something special that takes a lot of time (usually tamales, sometimes lumpia)."},

So we are kind of living in limbo--no renovating our house because it may sell soon, no travel plans set yet because what if the house doesn't sell?

Today I came to the startling revelation that my crap isn't worth nearly as much as I thought it was!To date, I have raised $560 (garage sale), $100 (sold couch on Craigslist), and $40 (sold two Sportsac purses on eBay). I have a half dozen other things on Craigslist and I may also sell one of my handguns this week too. Selling all of these things to raise money sure sure has been an enlightening experience.I think many people over value the things that they have and assume that if they need to raise some quick cash by selling their stuff, they will be able to get around half of what they originally paid for the item. Not true. Most stuff actually ends up selling for around 10% to 20% of the item's original price. Bummer. This will certainly make me pay more attention to both the stuff that I buy from now on and the price that I pay for said items.From now on, instead of thinking \"wow, that guy is making bank from his garage sale\" or \"wow, that lady sells a lot of things on CraigsList\", I will now think \"wow...those people are losing money because when you pay $10 for something and then only recoup $1 or $2 when you go to resell the item, it's like you are throwing the other $8 or $9 out the window\".This really drives home the point that for each item you buy, you at least want to buy it on sale. Hopefully you will get the item at a clearance sale where the price is 75% off the last marked clearance price. Ideally, you will buy the item in very good condition at a garage sale or thrift store for pennies on the dollar."},

{"title": "1/3 of The Way to My Goal...and Some Garage Sale Tips", "date": "Saturday, May 8, 2010", "text": "We had a garage sale today and raked in $560! I am one third of the way to my goal! Yeah!Here's how we run our garage sales:A few years ago we made up some fairly big, neon green signs that simply say \"Yard Sale' with an arrow. We put ten of these signs around our neighborhood to drive traffic from the main roads and many people who show up comment on the nice bright signs that they followed to our house.I put an advertisement on CraigsList yesterday evening so it would show up high enough on the list that people who are looking last night would see the ad and people who check the site in the morning will also see it.We start early. Our usual time to open up our sale is 7am and surprisingly there are usually people waiting earlier than that for us to set up. Amazing. We also close early (around 3pm) because we know from prior sales that traffic drops off dramatically later in the day.We only hold the sale on Saturday only. Again, from past experience, the biggest crowd of shoppers shows up early on Saturday morning. Sundays are usually really slow and not worth our time.We don't do a lot of pre-pricing but rather set up tables with signs \"all items on this table $1\", etc. There is nothing more tedious than pricing every little item. Of course the bigger and more expensive things get their own big tag (usually made out of neon index cards).We put the \"big draw\" items in the center of the driveway then place tables around it. This helps people who are \"drive by shoppers\" see things that may catch their eye and make them stop.We are always open to making a deal. Yes I want to make some money from our sale but the other main reason we have garage sales is to get rid of stuff. It's not a bad thing to knock off a dollar or so and/or give a discount when people buy a handful of things. We will happily haggle with buyers but draw the line at super low ball offers.One person is in charge of the money...it's less confusing that way.We try to make the things we set out for the sale look as nice as possible, even if it means just dusting the item off.We have a \"free\" box. Some stuff I just want to get rid of but don't think anyone will buy so we give some stuff away free.Overall we had a pretty successful sale and cleared out a big part of our garage. The most surprising thing that happened was when a big bus pulled up and let off a bunch of people to shop--turns out the local senior home makes a regular Saturday \"garage sale\" run for its residents. Wow."},
{"title": "My Latest Challenge...I Need $1500", "date": "Thursday, May 6, 2010", "text": "Quite a while ago I posted my list of financial goals.  Seems I completed two goals then kind of slacked off (stuff like travel got in the way).  So when I got hubby's latest Target bill, I was so annoyed with it (high interest plus it is a credit card and I hate credit cards), I decided to throw my entire check ($3000) and bonus check that I will be getting in a couple of weeks ($2000) at it.  Which leads me to my latest challenge...I need to earn $1500 within the next two weeks to pay our house payment.  I know most people would think 'pay house payment first' then pay debts but for some reason this debt has been hanging around forever and the only way I can see to kill it completely is with big chunks of money in order to pay it off all at once.  If I can't make my goal of $1500 I am willing to use my emergency fund to cover the house payment (I can hear Dave Ramsey groaning now), but I have a number of ways planned that I think will help me reach my $1500 goal.  These include:Since we are planning to downsize (unfortunately no takers on the house yet) I am selling the newish queen-sized bed from our guest room on Craigslist (our smaller place won't have room for a guest room).I am also selling a bunch of other stuff on Craigslist that is currently stored in the garage (mountain bike, TV, Ikea closet system, roll top desk, etc).I am eBaying purses like a mad woman.  I have a number of designer purses (mostly Coach and Le Sportsac) which seem to eBay well.We will be having a garage sale this weekend.I will even sell more gold if I need to.Also, since my no spend week, I have only spent less than $25 total on groceries.  No makeup (yet), no nothing else that was on my shop list.  I may need to take frugal to the extreme for a month or so but paying off this debt will be so worth it!Anyway, like I said before, hubby doesn't like change and he hates to part with ANYTHING but he has been a good sport about this because he knows that I am so focused on getting out of debt that he probably figures he better get out of my way or I will eBay him next.  Actually, since I always include all of the positive things about how getting out of debt will help us (ie: we can travel more, I can work less, he can keep his entire pension and spend it however he likes instead of on bills) he has really come around.  For someone who didn't want to part with the house, he is the one who \"stages\" it every morning before we leave just in case prospective buyers stop by.  He even mowed the yard a couple of days ago and mowed a nice pattern into the lawn to catch people's eye.I've read quite a few blogs where people have described how desperate they were to get out of debt that some even sold literally everything they had in order to become debt free.  That is about the point I am at.  The peace of mind that comes with being debt free is worth way more than a closet full of designer duds or the latest electronics!"},

For some reason I have done no spend weeks before but I never felt so stressed about not spending.  I think it may be because I didn't really prepare for this no spend week because the prior week was so crazy.  Anyway, I am down to eating frozen fruit (because I didn't prepare ahead of time and buy enough fruit), I have one onion and one tomato left (ditto), my eye liner is a stubby stick and my face powder is scraping bottom, my hair is a frizzy mess because I put off my haircut by two weeks (too busy to get my hair cut the previous week and no money to pay for it last week), and my bus pass has $1 on it (again, I didn't recharge it prior to challenge) so I couldn't go anywhere on the bus yesterday.The good things: I am sure I saved a lot of money this week.  Today hubby and I spent an hour at Costco this afternoon eating free food samples.  And, we are actually eating some of the food that has been stuffed into the back of cupboards and the fridge because we didn't go out and eat at all this week (other than food provided at work).  I am also even more thankful that I actually have a job and money to spend and this challenge just reinforced how much we take for granted having the ability to run out to the store and buy anything we need (people in many poor countries don't have this luxury).Overall the challenge went well and I may even try doing a no spend week once a month (we seriously have enough stuff to tide us over for a week of no spending, it's just that I want NEW stuff, not OLD stuff when it comes to food, clothing, etc).p.s. Thanks to all who made comments that kept my spirits up through the challenge!!!"},
{"title": "No Spend Week--Day 6 Update", "date": "Saturday, May 1, 2010", "text": "Today I spent $0!  Six days, I can't believe it!I actually stayed home all day recuperating from my very busy week.  A friend rented a huge bus to take people from our city to downtown Seattle to participate in the immigration march but I was really wiped out so I didn't go, however that would have been a free thing to do today.What I wanted to buy: everything!  I am feeling really constrained by not being able to spend.  Actually I wanted to do a Volksmarch today but the cost is $3 and I am not spending today so I couldn't go.  Also, I was suddenly in desperate need of new clothes but again, I didn't go to the mall so I wouldn't be tempted to spend.  This evening hubby wanted \"something good\" for dinner but I told him I had two days left of no spending so we ended up eating leftovers.  It wasn't bad (free prime rib leftover dinners from yesterday's conference) but it is hard not to treat ourselves even at the local Wendy's (dollar menu of course).Today (again, this was for yesterday because when I got home from a 12 hour work day I was exhausted) I spent $0.This is a unique week in that almost every day I have been at day-long, work-related events including training sessions, conferences, and day long meetings.  Fortunately most of these events included lots of free food so I didn't have to plan to bring food with me from home or, for that matter, cook much at home either.  Today was a day long conference hosted by one of my clients which meant I got to work for about 12 hours straight.  Fortunately this conference includes lots of food being served all day long so I didn't go hungry.What I wanted to spend: not much.  I was so tired that I went straight home from work and went to sleep.  I was thinking, however, that it had been a long time since I bought a Frapuccino at Starbucks.  It is also weird not to spend ANY MONEY for five days.  Without a conscious effort, I am sure I would have found some stuff to buy or at least went to the mall or dropped by Walmart.  But when I am trying not to spend money, I just naturally avoid these places so I won't be tempted to spend."},
{"title": "No Spend Week--Day 4 Update", "date": "Thursday, April 29, 2010", "text": "Another LONG day of meetings.  Unfortunately, no breakfast/snack items were provided and during the break while everyone ran to the local deli to grab a snack, I stayed in the meeting room and drank (free) water.  Lunch was paid for by the client, and I had a late dinner at home.  I thought today would be the end of the challenge because my friend called to tell me her mom was having surgery at the university hospital so I hopped on a bus after the meeting and rode from Kent to the University of Washington.  Fortunately, my prepaid transit card had just enough to get me from my meeting (which I carpooled to) to the University hospital to the ferry and back home.  Now I have about $1 left on my transit card until I can spend money and recharge it. What I wanted to buy: a mid morning snack/breakfast since I forgot to bring something with me, something from the University Bookstore (they have such cool office supplies there and I love office supplies) and some Indian food on the way home.  But I held onto my money and didn't buy anything...wow four days and I haven't spent ANY money  :)Today (yesterday if you are looking at the date) I spent $0.I had a morning breakfast meeting with a client who (yeah) bought me breakfast.  I was then able to be home for lunch, went to another meeting, and got back in time to eat dinner at home.What I wanted to buy: a haircut (I usually get my hair cut at the end of each month but since this is a no spend week, I will have to put this off until next week), a watermelon (the first of the season...it was only 39 cents a pound but I can't spend so no watermelon this week :(  ), and makeup (I am scraping the bottom of my powder and eyeliner but these items too will need to wait).  Eating at home is definitely cheaper than eating out and, since this is a no spend week, I need to plan for each day.  If I won't be home, I need to bring food and/or a beverage with me or else I will be out of luck (and hungry)...fortunately, food has been included in nearly every meeting I have had this week."},

A late evening meeting right after the conference left me with no time to go anywhere or do anything that would require money. What I wanted to spend: actually nothing today because I didn't have time to do anything but work although my friends at the conference all went to the student store (the conference was at a university) and bought cute pens.  I didn't because #1 I didn't bring any money with me which kept me from buying, #2 I seriously didn't need to buy a pen (they were giving them away--not as cute mind you--by the handfuls at the conference), and #3 this is a no spend week and I didn't want to mess that up.On a down note, a month or so ago we paid around $1000 to fix something important in hubby's car (like the engine) and today hubby took the car to the shop because it was making a weird noise when you turn the wheel and he got an estimate to fix the problem--for about $1400 :("},

{"title": "The Finances of Goal Achievement (And My Goal List)", "date": "Sunday, April 25, 2010", "text": "Last week, when I turned 43, I made up a list of 43 goals I wanted to achieve during my 43rd year of life. Previously I had tried various lists of goals--100 goals in 1001 day (boring), 400 goals in 400 days (too many!)--so this year, I figured I would focus on 43 difficult yet achievable goals. Yesterday I achieved one of the goals on my list--to walk a marathon--and today...well, let's just say that my feet have never hurt this bad in my life. For one thing, I am not as young as I used to be, and for another, I probably should have practiced more before I attempted this goal (since previously the longest I had ever walked was 13 miles). Oh well, live and learn. I did, however, achieve my goal of walking 26 miles. And it only took me eight hours (I am not a fast walker). The financial part: With so many expenses this month--a very expensive car repair, getting the house ready to sell--I was nearly flat broke and actually had no idea how I was going to achieve this goal. Fortunately, as what usually happens when you focus on a goal and put it out to the universe, the money part of it just kind of fell into place. I had registered for the marathon on a whim nearly six months ago so the entry fee was already paid. Since it was my birthday last week, a friend had given me a $50 Visa gift card which we used for gas, I was able to find a really nice hotel on Hotwire for $60 (this was a $150/night hotel and I am really picky about my surroundings so I simply don't do crappy hotels), and, also for my birthday, I got a couple of Starbucks gift cards from other friends so all of our meals for the overnight trip and throughout the day while I was walking was provided for free via Starbucks. Plus another friend met us when we got into town and took us out to dinner so we had a great meal at no charge to us. Financially the trip cost me a total of $60 which was a lot less than I thought it would. For a look at my other upcoming goals, here's what I will achieve during the next year: Note: green=completed, blue=not completed, red=impossible to complete, purple=situation changed enough to make this mute Walk a marathon just to see if I can do it (completed 4/24/2010)Go to Tillicum Village since I have never been there before and it is so close to my home (completed 8/2/2010)Visit my sister in law in Atlanta since we haven't been there in years (completed 10/1/2010)Go to Connecticut where hubby will compete in the WPT Tournament, let's hope he makes it to the final table (completed 10/23/2010)Go on a cruise since we haven't been on one in quite a while (completed 10/22/2010)Go to Japan and visit a very old woman I have been corresponding with for over 20 yearsGo to the Philippines for a month or twoSing on Wowowee because this is my favorite Filipino TV show (not completed, the show was cancelled on 7/31/2010)Dance with Ellen (yep, Ellen from the Ellen Show...I have no idea how to accomplish this one)Go kayaking because while I have canoed often I have never tried kayaking (completed 7/7/2010)Bike from Canada to Mexico because it would be a huge accomplishmentGo to Vancouver BC and Victoria BC because I haven't been to either of these places in years (Victoria BC completed 8/20/2010)Renew my passport because it will expire at the end of the year (completed 8/6/2010)Go to Las Vegas for a mini family reunionFinish my college degree.

{"title": "How Far Can You Get on $10?", "date": "Wednesday, April 21, 2010", "text": "This is how far... Today I took my $10 and headed out (on foot so there was no transportation expense) to see how much I could buy. Here's what I got:Birthday card for a friend in Japan $0.54 Overseas stamp for said birthday card $0.98 My favorite Trail mix $1 One pound of pasta $1 One can of pasta sauce $1 Box of Special K Cereal $2 One banana $0.26One candy bar $0.34 Five hours of ice skating $2.50For a grand total of $9.62. The remaining change will go into my change jar.I needed to get the card because my friend's birthday is next week (so technically I am late doing this because it will take at least a week to get to her). And the stamp is important to actually get the card to Japan. While I was at the Dollar Store getting the card, I picked up the pasta and sauce so that I can make a pasta bake tonight for dinner. I also get my trail mix from the Dollar Store because it is both cheap and has all of the stuff I like in it (dates, soy nuts, etc) and since I will do the marathon this weekend, the trail mix is necessary as this is what I usually eat when I am walking. Hubby asked me to pick up dessert for him so he gets cereal, something he actually likes to have for dessert in the evenings. The cereal was on sale with an in-store coupon. The candy bar was also on sale with an in-store coupon and even though I rarely ever buy candy, it looked good (and like a cheap treat because at the time I was craving a Starbucks which would have taken nearly half of my $10). I was also hungry this morning and the banana looked good (and cheap as well; I looked at the strawberries but one pound was $2.50 so bananas were a better value). Finally, I was looking at our local newspaper online this morning to find out what was happening in the community and saw that every Wednesday at the local ice skating rink, you can pay for skate rental and skate for free. For FIVE hours from noon to 5pm.  Wow.  While I only skated for about 45 minutes--I didn't want to get blisters because of the marathon--I still think that is an exceptional value. The rink was full of parents of kids who got out of school early today and had the same idea. So this challenge shows that you can actually get pretty far on $10 in an average American city. I would have liked to buy a pound of frozen vegetables to add to the pasta but I didn't have the extra dollar to do so. It made me think about people who really only have $10 to buy food for themselves and/or their family and how they would have to make choices between the kind of food they buy whereas many people just toss whatever they want in their cart without needing to make hard choices. I also thought about the lady over at Less Is Enough who did a $1 a day for food for a month challenge. When you are just starting off on a challenge you have to make choices but as she showed during her project, you can use your money to buy more than enough for one meal, thus having leftovers (which we will definitely have with the pasta) so some of this money from today's project will actually feed us lunch for the next couple of days.Overall this was an excellent lesson in stretching my money AND in making choices that would give me the best bang for my buck."},

The news, some blogs, and a comment are my sources of inspiration for some challenges I will hold myself to in the coming weeks.I was perusing CNN and came across this interesting challenge, How Far Can You Get on $10?  Well I aim to find out.  Tomorrow I don't have much work (only one short meeting), so I will take my $10 bill and see how far I can stretch it and how many interesting things I can do.A personal goal is to walk a marathon and it just so happens that a walking marathon is coming up this Saturday in Vancouver, WA.  This should be quite the challenge and it is on my goal list (note the '400 Goals in 400 Days' that I posted about a while back has been downsized to 43 goals that I intend to achieve this year starting last Saturday which was my 43rd birthday..more on this in a later post) so I am hauling my carcass down to Vancouver and will hopefully complete an entire 26 mile walk in one day!I received a comment from Young Mogul who pointed out that my no spend week some months ago was really not much of a challenge because I stayed home most of the time and of course, unless you are a dedicated online shopper, you really can get by without spending money if you stay home because there is both no temptation and no place to spend your money.  Of course she was right.  So...my challenge for the last week of the month (April 25-May 1) is to do a no spend week.  This should be a lot more challenging because I have out of town meetings/training sessions four out of seven days that week.  And of course the very first place our car pool group stops on the way to these meetings is Starbucks, and of course I have a Starbucks addiction...and so you can imagine how challenging this may be.  Then I came across some other interesting challenges: a $40 weekly spending/entertainment plan, a one week on $20 challenge, and a post by Betsy at Married With Luggage about a number of people who have challenged themselves to live with just 100 things.  The month of May looks like it may encompass all of these things--we should have an offer on our house soon (so says our realtor) which would mean next month will pose a number of challenges: we need to downsize our stuff considerably to fit it into our new place (the 100 thing challenge or thereabouts), and I also intend to keep my spending to between the $20 and $40 per week because I told our lender we would have hubby's credit card paid off before the house closes which means every single penny I can round up will go to that debt.So stay tuned...this should be an interesting month and a half..."},
{"title": "10 Free Ways to Improve Your Health", "date": "Monday, April 19, 2010", "text": "Good health can be practically free if you take the time (and the self control) to do these simple, free things:Drink only water. Water is one of the few free things you can get in a restaurant. You can carry a water bottle around with you and not look uncool. Generally anywhere you go you can ask for free water (or a free water bottle fill up).Walk. People really don't walk much anymore even though it is a great (free!) way to exercise. Try walking to do your errands this week, even if it means driving downtown and parking in a central location then walking to the bank/post office/library/etc.Go to the park. Parks (city parks anyway) are also still free. Go to the park, get some sunshine, breathe deeply, walk, watch the birds, and basically chill out from your stressful day.Test your blood pressure. There are many places--malls, grocery stores, fire departments--where you can get your blood pressure checked for free. Most places have the little machine you stick your arm in, hit the button, and get a read out. At our local fire department, you can walk in and ask to have your blood pressure checked for free.Meditate. People are generally stressed out these days. Find a quiet place (even if it is the broom closet at your office) to take ten minutes, close your eyes, breathe in and out, and clear your mind. It will put you in your happy place.Check out some books on health, nutrition, and fitness from the library. Free education, especially when it is paired with a useful topic such as health, is a win-win proposition.Hug someone, or better yet, trade massages. Human touch is good for your health.Exercise with the (free) things in your environment. If you don't have hand weights, lift cans of soup. If you don't have a Stairmaster, go up and down the stairs in your area's tallest building. You can make a jump rope out of an...um...rope. Play tag with the kids. Do some sit ups and push ups.Choose nutritious food. If you go to a party, choose the vegie tray instead of the more unhealthy offerings. If you are at a morning meeting, choose the fruit instead of the calorie laden donuts. If you are cooking at home, bring out the vegies from the back of the fridge and the whole grains from the back of the cupboard and create something nutritious for dinner. You are paying for food anyway (or in some cases, receiving it for free at events) so choose what to eat based on what food is most nutritious.Sleep. Besides being stressed, most people don't get enough sleep. Turn off the TV early and get an extra hour of sleep. Take a rejuvenating mid day nap."},

The plan is that we will be selling our home then buying a new place, all of which should be completed within the next couple of months.  That means we need to reduce all of our stuff that currently fits into a big house to an amount that will comfortably fit into a small condo.  Needless to say, I have been eBaying and Craiglisting religiously over the past couple of weeks.  A big garage sale (or two or three) is also in the works.We have taken a look at the PODS system and may consider this as an option to transition us through the move.  I'm still a little fuzzy about how all of this works because the last time we moved, we kept our older house as a rental so we simply moved into our new house at our leisure then rented the old house after we were completely moved.  This time around it looks like our house sale will close before out new condo sale will close so we will have a week or so during which we need to be out of our current house but not yet moved into our new place.  In addition, I plan to do major work on the new place (painting, flooring, new appliances and cabinets, etc) which may take a few weeks to complete.  A friend of mine had good luck with renting a \"POD\".  She simply packed up all of her stuff into the POD which was delivered to her home, had the company move it to her new city, then store it for the few months until her new house was finished, then they drop the POD off at her new place and she unpacked it.  Simple."},
{"title": "20 Safety Items That Are Worth Their Weight in Gold", "date": "Friday, April 16, 2010", "text": "If you are a consumer (I think most all of us are) then you have probably had lots of practice justifying your purchases. Everything from I NEED X to I don't NEED X but it would be really useful for Y so I really should buy it. In my pre-cash-only days, I could justify a Coach purse and matching sunglasses if I needed to! While I am much more careful with my money these days, there are a number of items, mostly related to safety and well being, that are definitely worth the cash it costs to buy them. These items include:Child safety seats and booster seats. Many, if not all, states require these and when you look at the minimal cost versus the life it could save, there really is no question about the value of these important items.Smoke detectors. Again, these items can and do save lives. Each home, and each bedroom within the home, should have smoke detectors. It's a small price to pay for a life.Flashlights. Whether these are used to find your way to the bathroom at night and prevent tripping or necessary to illuminate your way during a power outage, having flashlights with fresh batteries on hand are, again, a cheap price to pay for safety and security.Glasses. We can't all be born with perfect vision. Glasses can improve not only your sight but lessen headaches caused by vision problems and make you safer on the road. Obviously, a good use of your money.A phone of some sort (landline or cell). Years ago, not everyone had a phone. Sometimes you had to walk down to the phone booth, other times you needed to use the neighbor's phone, but these days, having a phone is nearly as necessary as having water and food. Phones can keep you in contact with friends and loved ones, allow you to call 911 for help, and help you reach out to vital services if necessary.Medication. There are critical medications that some people need in order to live. There are also critical medications that some people often stretch due to the cost (ie: they take their pills every other day instead of every day) because they can't afford their prescriptions. While I am a huge advocate of doing what you can to alleviate the need for medications (like exercising and eating nutritious food), I am also a huge advocate of taking medications, exactly as prescribed, even if it means spending a bit more money, if it means it will help save your life.A gun safe. Many people choose to keep firearms in their home. I am one of these people. I am also an evangelist for safety and feel that if you can afford a firearm, you also need to have the cash to purchase a gun safe to store it in. Trigger locks are mostly a joke, and \"hiding\" a gun in a closet is plain irresponsible. Spend the money it takes to buy a good gun safe and this way everyone in your home will be safer.Safety tie-downs. When you have things that are taller than they are wide, you have an item that could easily tip over during and earthquake or be pulled over by an inquisitive child. Save yourself the replacement cost (not to mention damage to people and pets) by purchasing inexpensive tie-downs that will keep your flat panel TVs upright, your bookcases stationary, and your hot water tank immobile.Sports safety equipment. Do the math...a bicycle helmet costs around $15. A motorcycle helmet costs around $100. A traumatic brain injury from falling off a bicycle or crashing on a motorcycle without a helmet costs upwards of a million dollars. Yikes. These figures also pertain to football pads and helmets, life jackets, mouth guards, and other items meant to improve safety for athletes.Insurance. Another math equation. Life insurance costs about $30 a month. Life without you could cost your family millions. House insurance costs about $50 per month. The cost to your home and property in the event of a fire can be in the hundreds of thousands if you don't have this important insurance coverage. Health insurance, while expensive at maybe $200-$700 per month, can actually save you hundreds of thousands of dollars should you have a medical emergency. Cab fare or a designated driver. The cost for a safe ride home after a night of partying is between $20 to $40. The cost for a first time DUI is about $5000 (provided you didn't kill anyone in which case you need to factor in prison time and restitution...).A safe car. Hubby is a fan of 'classic' cars. Classic means old. Old cars don't have things like air bags, seat belts, etc. The cost a of newer (this doesn't mean brand new), safe car is something that can be worth your family's life and you can't put a price on your life or the life of a loved one.A GPS device. This one is debatable. If you only travel in areas that you are very familiar with, this may not be needed but if you regularly drive to places that you are unfamiliar with (ie: realtors, pizza delivery drivers, etc) a GPS device that will get you safely to your destination may be a very worthwhile purchase.Items that impact your long term health. Things such as stop smoking products can significantly lengthen your lifespan while at the same time, significantly shrink your expense line item for cigarettes; this is a very good investment. Suntan lotion as opposed to getting sunburned is another inexpensive item that will pay you back later in life.Kid costs...as in, the cost of preventing an unwanted pregnancy. Condoms? About $5 a package. Cost to raise a child until adulthood, about $221,000. Birth control is another inexpensive option that will save you a couple hundred thousand dollars over the price of having a kid. Of course this isn't to say that people shouldn't have babies, but using an inexpensive method to prevent pregnancy until a family is ready to have a child can significantly impact your financial life.Illuminated clothing. Some people may debate this, but more than once a week, I drive down the street and see someone who could become an accident fatality/hospitalization statistic simply because they are walking down a dimly lit street at dusk or at night, almost always wearing black clothing, and drivers simply cannot see them until they are practically on top of them. Really dangerous. If you do walk or bike, an inexpensive investment in clothing or bands that are neon green or made of reflective material can save you (and the driver of the car) lots of money and heartache.Nutritious food. When it comes down to buying food, some families think they can only afford the inexpensive stuff (ie: processed food instead of fresh fruit and vegetables). The savings when making this decision is immediate but the long term consequences can be very expensive (ie: diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure). It is much more cost effective to spend a bit more on good, healthy food. Your body will thank you.Assistive devices. As we age, there are a number of things that we become less and less able to do. Things like hearing well, twisting around to look as you are backing down the street, bending over to pick things up...you get the idea. Assistive devices such as hearing aids, more mirrors or even a back up camera, or grippy picker-upper-devices that will help grandma pick up dropped items instead of running the risk of toppling over on her head are worth the price to purchase simply for safety's sake.Baby safety devices. Babies can get into all kinds of trouble in a home that looks perfectly safe to adults. To save the cost of running to the hospital or calling an ambulance, a number of devices have been created to make your home safer for your babies and small children such as window guards, electrical outlet covers, safety latches and locks, safety gates, and door knobs covers and door locks. These are simple, inexpensive fixes that will improve a child's safety in your home and possibly save you money and anguish in the long run.Education. Education has been called one of the best investments you can make in yourself. Paying for things such as CPR classes at the community center, taking some self defense classes at the local college, volunteering with the local ambulance crew and learning valuable life saving skills are all excellent ways to spend your time and money.Often times when we see something we want, we justify the purchase based on how they will make others perceive us (\"wow that girl is hot because she has a nice sports car\", \"hey check out that guy with a Rolex, he must be important\"). When you take control of your spending habits and your money, you will find another way to justify your purchases and that is by determining how much of a positive, indeed life saving impact, the item may have on you and your family."},
{"title": "A Few Notes About Your Credit Report", "date": "Thursday, April 15, 2010", "text": "As you know from previous posts, we are in the middle of a home sale and possible home purchase.  In the interest of being ahead of the game, we went to our local lender today to get pre-qualified for a home loan so that when we submit an offer on a new home, the pre-qual letter will be part of the package.  For those of you who have done this a time or two, you will know that lending (not just for houses but for most anything these days) revolves around your credit report.  Here's some things we learned today:First of all, I should have checked our credit reports prior to going in for a loan.  You can do this at no charge once a year at www.annualcreditreport.com.  I do this annually but it has been about a year since I checked our reports.  There were some surprises on the report that I should have known about.I had an \"outstanding debt\" of $1 for a credit card I cancelled two years ago.  I am not sure how I can pay the bill in full and not get any more bills from the company and still owe $1 but I will call the credit company tomorrow and get this straightened out.The hubby's sister put him on her credit card as an authorized user because a couple of her kids live in our area and sometimes she needs to get cash to them and she is wise enough not to put THEM on her card because they aren't the most financially responsible people in the world.  We didn't know that even though hubby was just added as a user on this account, and isn't the account holder, the credit card and its ensuing information shows up on his credit report.  Good thing she is responsible with her credit.  We will, however, be getting hubby's name off of that account.The report shows that about three years ago, I was late on my house payment ten months in a row (!).  Because of the way I was getting paid at the time, I was paying a week late for this time period.  Bad move on my part.  ALWAYS pay your debts on time because it will show up on your credit report if you are sloppy or late with your payments.Fortunately the local bank we use does manual underwriting so we are able to explain these situations and have the information taken into account when they decide on whether to give us a loan or not.If you are self employed (like I am) it is soooo important to keep good records and file your taxes honestly.  Some years ago when we got the loan for our current home, all I had to do was tell the lender that I was self employed--no stringent paper trail, very little documentation--and we got the loan.  They have tightened up their requirements quite a bit since then.  Fortunately, I report honestly and don't try to under report my income (which would lead the bank to think that I wouldn't be able to afford the home loan).That's all, nothing major was found that will preclude us from getting a mortgage on a new place, but it just reemphasized the fact that when our lives are impacted by credit reports (whether we choose to use credit or not) it is a good idea to keep your credit as pristine as possible.p.s.  When the banker asked why I had paid off all of my credit cards and closed the accounts, I said \"have you heard of Dave Ramsey?\"  She just smiled and said yes :)"},
{"title": "The Cash You Need", "date": "Tuesday, April 13, 2010", "text": "Cash is important. Some people think that if they at least have a credit card with some semblance of available credit on it, they have money that they can use. Not true. Nothing beats having actual cash on hand to use in situations where other forms of currency just won't work. Here's the cash you need:Cash in your wallet. I always keep $100 in my wallet for use in an emergency. And emergencies do come up--everything from restaurants that don't take debit cards (which you find out after you have already chowed down on your meal) to cash for a cab if you get stranded in a bad part of town to bail money (which is a whole other story).Cash at home. Some people have exactly zero cash at home, thinking that in an emergency, they can always use their debit card. There are times, however, when a debit card won't work. Like when you have a power outage and need to evacuate and don't have any gas in your car and the gas station down the street is only accepting cash. Like when you are heading out of town early in the morning and all of the ATMs in your neighborhood are down due to a computer problem. You get the idea. I keep $500 to $1000 securely stashed at home just in case.Cash in your emergency fund. Everyone needs an emergency fund. Credit cards, unlike what many people think, are not good fall backs in case of emergency as people learned when they went to use their credit cards about mid recession and found that their available credit went from like $1000 to $0 overnight because of a change in their card issuer's policy. Your best bet? Have a minimum of $1000 in your bank which is set aside for true emergencies only. Eventually you will want to build your emergency fund up to be able to cover six to eight months of living expenses.Cash in your retirement fund. If you want to look forward to your golden years instead of worry about them at night because you have absolutely nothing saved for retirement, be sure to start funding your 401k/403b/Roth IRA/etc. on a regular basis. With cash in your retirement account, you will have yet another source of emergency cash at your disposal (well not really at your disposal due to the huge penalties and fees that are levied if you do withdraw from these accounts if you are not of retirement age but still...it is another source of cash security).Cash alternatives. There are a number of things you can have on hand that can be used as cash alternatives if you are in dire straits. Things that can be easily sold/bartered/eBayed/Craigslisted/garage saled/etc in order to generate some fast cash include gold, firearms, electronic gadgets, name brand items, tools. etc.Cash in coin form. Many people overlook coins because, after all, what can you do with a few dimes? It is a good idea, however, to always carry some quarters with you in case of emergency (you need to hop a bus to get across town, you need to make a phone call, etc). I also keep a coin jar where I drop all of my coins each time I clean out my purse and use the money in the jar for various purposes: to wash big blankets at the laundromat, to give to the grandkids when they come to visit (they like to roll the coins then buy a treat with their rolled coins), to use at the car wash, etc.The security of having cash on hand cannot be over estimated. You never know when having some cash at your immediate disposal can save your life, or maybe just make it a bit safer or more comfortable."},
{"title": "21 Reasons Why We are Selling Our House", "date": "Saturday, April 10, 2010", "text": "This morning the sale ad for our house hit the internet and within an hour we had a realtor who wanted to bring his clients over to check out our home.  That was fast! Fortunately, hubby is warming up to the idea of selling our home and aside from a few (hourly) wisecracks about ending up homeless, he seems to see some of the possibilities that will result from the sale of our house.  As I was trying to encourage myself to go through with actually selling this house that I love, I came up with a list of why it is a good idea to sell now:The people who buy our house will get an $8000 tax credit which is one of the many reasons that so many people are out and about looking at homes this month (the credit ends April 30th).If we find a place we like and sign a contract on it by the end of the month, we will get a tax credit as well.No more yard work.  We aren't yard and garden people and we have a big yard.  Obviously this creates a problem.  I am either resenting the extra money I spend to have someone else do the yard work or doing it myself and resenting the time spent doing yard work when I would rather be doing something else.We will be debt free.  With the proceeds from the sale of the house, we will be able to pay off our remaining debts and become totally debt free.  Yipeee!We will have money left after paying off our debts that will allow us to travel, put a big down payment on a smaller house, or both.Our house it too big.  We literally don't use half of the house (the formal living room, one of the bathrooms, the guest bedroom, the bonus room) and it just seems so wasteful to take up so much space on the planet and not actually use it.We will have an excellent reason to downsize/minimize all of the junk we have collected over the course of 20+ years.  The average person does not need so much stuff to live a happy life and I aim to prove it (with a couple of the biggest garage sales our neighborhood has ever seen!).We will be able to afford higher quality decor/carpet/tile/etc. which we are planning to put in our new place because there will be less space to decorate (ie: carpeting 2500 square feet is a HUGE expense as opposed to carpeting less than 1000 square feet).It will be much cheaper to heat/air condition a small home than a larger home.It will take MUCH less time to clean a smaller place.We will also have the option travel for a year or two before settling down again, something we have always wanted to do.We are preparing for getting older.  I have seen way too many people hold on to farms/huge houses/houses with expensive upkeep way into their old age and it seems like nothing but a burden to them.  Big houses and big land is great when you have a big family to help you out but after the kids have grown up and moved away (which ours have), you are left with only one or two people doing the work that you used to have a whole family doing.  It is tiring and expensive and it keeps you from doing stuff you want to do like traveling or just hanging out at the library and reading on a quiet weekend because there is always so much work to be done.We want super manageable payments (which means that we may even be able to make double payments on the mortgage and pay it off super fast).  Now our payments are pretty big so it really curtails the things we can do.  Vacations need to be planned way in advance and making double payments are out of the question.  With a tiny mortgage and the corresponding tiny payments, we will easily be able to travel for an extended period of time while still paying the mortgage or stay home and hammer away at the mortgage until it is gone.  Of course, when we buy a new place we will get a 15 year fixed rate mortgage which is what we have on our current house.We are looking for a newer house which should need much fewer repairs.  Our current house is 20+ years old so if we stay here, we are eventually looking at a new roof, new siding, and some other repairs (such as replacing our 20+ year old hot water tank, 20+ year old appliances, etc.)  Those are expensive things!We are looking to the future and the possibility of living on one income.  Currently it takes two incomes to support our lifestyle.  Hubby has his retirement and soon will receive social security as well.  I have a business which provides us a good amount of money, however we want to minimize our bills to the point where we can easily pay our monthly bills on just hubby's income.  A couple year sabbatical from my business/community/social responsibilities/etc is looking really nice right now.We want lifestyle options.  Literally ALL of the people we know have no lifestyle options to speak of.  They (we) are like hamsters in a wheel when it comes to our lifestyle because, due to being typical Americans, we work, we buy stuff, we work more, we buy bigger stuff, we run up debt, we have big mortgage payments, we can't leave our jobs for fear of going bankrupt... So you end up with one lifestyle option (working and spending).  Bummer.  We want the option of working because we want to not because we have to, being able to take off at a moment's notice to go to Europe for a month, being able to set aside large chunks of time to work on big projects (for me, writing a book), spending time with the grand kids, etc.I occasionally worry about natural disasters.  In our area, it is not IF an earthquake will happen, but WHEN.  If we put all of our money and soul into our house (which BTW doesn't have earthquake insurance) and a major earthquake hits, we really will be homeless.  If we have a tiny home and a lot of money in savings and a lot of options for vagabonding around the world, such an event will have much less impact on us.I am kind of looking forward to it being like when the hubby and I first met.  We had absolutely nothing (me because I was a college student at the time and hubby because he had just been divorced and his wife got literally everything) but we were very happy when we made a cool thrift shop find, when we had to slide the ironing board out of the way to get to the washing machine, and when we had exactly four plates, four forks, and four cups in our entire tiny apartment.  Don't get me wrong, we are very happy now, and we certainly aren't planning to live as minimally as we did years ago, but I think that by downsizing significantly we may just end up even happier if that is possible.I'm looking forward to a wonderful new adventure.  We have had the same house for over a decade.  Same neighbors for over a decade.  Same scenery for over a decade.  I am looking forward to a whole new life!I have no idea what the economy will do but I suspect it may tank even more in the upcoming months then take a decade to recover.  I would rather not have a significant amount of money invested in real estate at this time.I don't want to be normal.  Normal is keeping up with the Joneses, working like a maniac, and being in debt.  So you can see why I don't want to be normal.  Selling our home at a point when most people would think we are crazy since \"everyone\" needs a nice house is maybe the first step in being abnormal.  Hooray for us!  So that's it...the reasons that keep me moving forward with selling our home and getting out of debt when most everyone else will think we have lost our minds."},
{"title": "What to Do With Debt", "date": "Friday, April 9, 2010", "text": "When it comes to your debt, you have a lot of options.  Here's some ways to deal with your debt:Pay it off, in full, as soon as possible.  This can be done although many times people think it is such an overwhelming thing to do that they want to give up before they even give it a try.  If you have debt, paying it off should be your first option.  You made the debt, you should pay it off.  Not only will this up your credit score, but the actual work of paying your debt off (which is usually quite a slog) will change your attitude about incurring debt in the future.  If you feel like this would be impossible, check out Dave Ramsey who will give you hope that it is, in fact, quite possible, and probably at a quicker rate than you ever thought possible.File bankruptcy.  This should be your absolute last option.  There are some cases, like when a person is overwhelmed with medical debt due to a horrible accident which has left them unable to ever work again, where this may be their only option.  But if, as in most cases, you spent like a maniac and are now faced with a massive pile of credit card debt, just pawning off your debt with a bankruptcy filing is both irresponsible AND it doesn't teach you the valuable lessons that will keep you from incurring future debt.Debt consolidation.  I rather hate this option for a couple of reasons.  First of all, there are a lot of debt consolidation companies that are just plain rip-offs.  So not only are you in debt, you will soon find out that the debt consolidation company that was supposed to help you out, actually took advantage of your desperation, and took what little money you had left.  Bummer.  The second and third and fourth reasons why I hate this option is that one, if you do find a reputable company, they will set you up on a repayment plan that will take forever; two, you will be mingling small, short term debts with high interest large debts which doesn't make financial sense; and three, by turning over your responsibility for paying off the debts that you incurred, you don't get the full learning experience like you would get if you paid off your debts, in full, all by yourself.Challenging your debt.  Another popular debt \"rip off\" encourages people with debt to \"challenge the enforceability of their debts.\"  This may make your debt go away but if it is indeed your debt, it is highly unethical and karma will get you eventually (IMHO).  Obviously if you find debts on your credit report that definitely aren't yours, you should take every action to have them removed but if you incurred debt, using devious means to try to make the debt go away is not something I would recommend.Making a settlement.  In some cases you may have such huge amounts of debt that it could literally take forever to pay it off yourself.  You may have foreclosures, repossessions, big IRS debt, etc. and feel that you have no choice but to file for bankruptcy, however there is another option you may want to consider first and this is making a settlement offer.  Generally this works, not when you are paying your bills up to date each month, but rather when you are way behind in your payments or haven't made payments towards the debt for quite a while.  Simply call up the collection agency or whichever company holds your debt and ask to make a settlement.  In some cases you can offer pennies on the dollar, and if accepted--be SURE to get it in writing before you send your check--you send the check for the full payment that you had negotiated and you will have paid the debt in full which will be reflected on your credit report.Some things not to do:Never give a creditor access to your bank account.  Pay them via check or money order but never give them electronic access to your account or they may, and often will, clean it out for you.Use debt to pay debt.  Some people take out pay day loans or use a credit card in order to make payments on their debt.  You will never get out of debt this way and your debt will multiply exponentially.Hide from your creditors.  They will catch up with you eventually, even if they have to go to court and garnish your wages.  Better to talk to them and work out a deal to pay the debt.Put your debt in other people's names.  Aside from the usual identity theft issues (like prison), or using a friend/roommate/brother's info to incur debt (because like YOU can't get credit--here's your sign) which leads to arguments, lawsuits, and the occasional appearance on Judge Judy, or worse, putting your debt in your kids name which is the lowest of the low, you never want to use someone else's name to incur debt.  This NEVER works out well.The bottom line is that if you have debt, you should endeavour to get rid of it as soon, and as responsibly, as possible.  If you are overwhelmed, listening to or watching Dave Ramsey on a regular basis will show you that being debt-free no matter where you are starting at is, in fact, quite possible."},
{"title": "Use Half.  Save Money.", "date": "Thursday, April 8, 2010", "text": "Do you realize how much stuff has a \"suggested amount\" that you should use which, in reality, is often way more than you actually need? This means you could be saving a whole lot of product, and thus money, and still get the needed benefit out of the stuff that you buy. Consider:Toothpaste. Commercials show that you need a huge glob of toothpaste on your brush in order to get your teeth clean. You don't. A little dab on your toothbrush will provide the same effect--getting your teeth clean.Shampoo. The bottle says to lather, rinse, and repeat. You only need to lather and rinse and you will still end up with clean hair.Laundry soap. The bottle with the measuring cap makes it look like you need a lot of detergent to get your laundry clean. In reality, detergents are much more concentrated than they used to be, washing machines are much more efficient at cleaning, and most people aren't working on farms like they did in decades past so your clothes aren't all that dirty to start with. Use half the amount of soap that is recommended and see if your clothes don't get just as clean, If you want to do a little test, put some towels that you just washed and dried back into the washer, set it on the wash cycle without the soap, and when it gets to the agitate cycle check out the water. If you see soap bubbles you will know that there is still soap in your clothing that you thought had been rinsed out. Use less soap, get less soap residue in your laundry (and save money too).Dryer sheets. I don't know where I picked up the habit but for as long as I can remember, when I open a new box of dryer sheets, I cut them all in half. Then for each load of laundry I throw in the dryer, I just toss in half a dryer sheet and still get the fresh smelling, anti-static-y results that I am after.Heat. If you usually have your heat on 24/7, consider running it only the few hours a day that you are actually at home and awake. Otherwise set the thermostat to 55, throw some extra blankets on the bed, and/or in the evening run a small space heater in your room before bed instead of heating the whole house, and enjoy lots of savings on your heating bills.Hand soap. The average pump on your hand soap will spit a huge glob out onto your hands. Just push the dispenser down half way, get a half serving of soap, scrub your hands vigorously for about thirty seconds, and you will end up with clean hands.Hot water. Keeping a huge tank of water hot 24/7 is a mostly American custom. In most countries, water is heated only when it is needed in order to save money. So, to save money on your hot water bill, do these things: set your thermostat to 120 degrees, put water saver shower heads on all of your showers, conserve water by using less of it, and put a timer on your hot water tank in order to turn in on only when you will need it (usually in the morning and evening).Denture adhesive. If you watch the commercials, you will see the announcer plaster a huge line of denture adhesive from one side of the denture plate to the other. Not only is this messy and causes a copious amount to \"squish out\" when you put the dentures in your mouth, it is a waste of good product. A better way to do this, from those in the know, is to put small dabs of the paste on each side and at the front-when you insert the dentures, this will squeeze out a bit and provide a good bond between your dentures and gums.Water for plants. Some people plant flowers, fruit trees, or vegetables, then proceed to water them deeply everyday. This is usually not necessary and can actually hurt the plants because it encourages shallow root growth instead of forcing the roots of the plants to grow deeper in search of water. Cut back to watering deeply every dew days and watch your water bill shrink (and your plants grow better).Band aids. This is getting down to the nitty gritty, but we have, on occasion, cut big band aids in half (length-wise of course) for use on little kids with little \"boo boos\".Paper towels. Another of the things I do automatically is to use half of a paper towel for almost all uses. I simply rip the paper towel in half length-wise and leave the other half hanging on the role for the next use (it doesn't look pretty but it does double the life of a roll of paper towels). Anti freeze. If you live in a mild climate, you may want to use half anti freeze and half water instead of full strength antifreeze.These are just a few of the ways that you can use less of a product, save money, and still get the use out of the product that you need. From now on, when you are using a product, ask yourself how you could use less of said product and still meet your needs.p.s. A couple of caveats: there are some products that you don't want to use less of in order to save money. These include prescription medicine (use as directed) and measured components in baking and cooking (unless you know it won't impact the edibility of the item you are creating)."},
{"title": "The Downsizing Plan Has Begun...Excuse Me While I Have a Panic Attack", "date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2010", "text": "Quite a while ago I wrote about some downsizing plan ideas I had.  For months the ideas never really went anywhere however since we came back from vacation a few weeks ago, I was more motivated than ever to a) downsize our living accommodations (our house is way too big for us and the payments are pretty big as well), b) pay off our debts, c) minimize our possessions, and d) travel the world.The main problem with moving forward with this plan is that hubby hates change, doesn't want to be involved in change, and practically breaks out in hives when major change happens.  Although he agrees in theory with my plan--he thinks our house is too big, would really like to be out of debt, and loves to travel--he just doesn't want to do the changes required to get from point a to point d.While I was trying to move along slowly to reach these goals, I realized that slow change equals no change.  Without some drastic changes we are going to be stuck in the same place, next year and the year after, that we are at now.So this morning I called our favorite real estate agent, briefed hubby that we were going to sell the house, and this afternoon we formally listed our house for sale.  Commence panic attack.Hopefully this is how the plan will work:We sell the house at the full listing price (since we are not forced to sell, I told the realtor that we want our listing price and that we aren't interested in bargaining down the price because we have a target amount of money we want to make from the sale of the house).We use part of the proceeds of the sale to pay off our debts and become totally debt free.We are then left with about $40,000 to fund a couple of years of travel or use as a down payment on a much smaller house, or do both--travel for a year then buy a smaller house with a smaller down payment.Among my concerns:How are we going to get rid of all of our stuff?  I don't want to put everything in storage for a year or two so it looks like we are going to have the mother of all garage sales--or three--in order to purge ourselves of nearly everything we own.  Did I mention hubby likes his possessions?  He owns nearly 75 hoodie jackets and that is just the beginning of his clothes-horse tendencies.  This part should get interesting in a month or so...Where are we going to go after our house sells?  We have tentative plans to travel to Asia for three or four months after the house sells then spend a month or so with each of a half dozen family members who live in various places around the US.  There will be some in between time right after the sale in which we may see if we can stay with a cousin for a month or two while we get ready to travel.  Hubby's other problem is that he doesn't want to end up \"homeless\" and after the sale, he will technically be \"homeless\".How is hubby going to handle this?  He has been very quiet today but not totally opposed to the plan--I think his disdain for change is being rivaled with his desire to be debt free and do some traveling.  In fact my main impetus for this project is that hubby is now over 60 and I want to ensure that we have plenty of time to spend traveling before age and infirmity keeps us more home-bound, and, more importantly, that we are totally debt free because, knock on wood, should one of us die, I don't want the other of us to be saddled with debt.Am I doing the right thing?  I am sure that as soon as people find out what we are doing they are going to think I have lost my damn mind.  We are in an enviable position with having a nice house in a wonderful location, hubby is retired and I have a great business (which also will go on the sales block ASAP), we can still afford to travel and enjoy some of the finer things in life (because we are so frugal, which is what most people don't see) and so people will wonder why we want to give up all of that \"security\" and \"status\" to be as hubby says, homeless vagabonds (it didn't help much when I told him that there is a burgeoning vagabond industry, just read the blogs...).  The older I get, however, I don't see having any item with a debt attached to it as \"security\".  It is the dead weight of debt that, with one small misfortune like a job loss or illness, will sink us and literally make us homeless (and broke) and opposed to homeless (with a sizable amount of cash in savings).I am crossing my fingers that all of this works out well however it is sooo stressful!  Fortunately many people have gone before me and right now I am grabbing onto their blogs with both hands for inspiration and assurance that I, indeed, haven't lost my mind.p.s.  The blogs that have motivated such goals for me include Family on Bikes, Married with Luggage, Vagablogging, Female Nomad, and Man vs Debt. p.s.s. Thanks for letting me vent!"},
{"title": "Get Your Finances in Order...In Case You Die", "date": "Tuesday, April 6, 2010", "text": "Some people think I am rather blunt and reading that headline I am inclined to agree with them, but, and this is a big BUT, when you are talking about a topic people would rather ignore, like death, sometimes you have to shock people to get their attention.Now that I have your attention...Everyone is going to die. Hopefully for you, me, and everyone else, death will come later rather than sooner, however, everyday I get to review reports of people who have died--everyone from the elderly who die of natural causes to the teenagers who were full of life just prior to the car accident/drug overdose/freak unexpected medical incident that rapidly took their life. In most cases death is sad and traumatic for surviving loved ones, and it for this specific reason that it is extremely important for everyone, no matter how old or young you are, to get your financial house in order now, before it is too late. I have seen more than enough cases of family members fighting like hyenas over an estate because there was no Will and only vaguely remembered promises made by the deceased loved one, more than enough cases of the primary wage earner thinking they would save money by not buying life insurance only to die unexpectedly and leave the family destitute, and more than enough cases of people who have waged more-than-long-enough battles with incurable diseases left on life support because there were no advanced medical directives.The way to protect your family when you die, is to start with the basics. Here's nine things you need to get organized straight away so that if the worst should happen, your loved ones will be taken care of:Have a Will which has been legally created, notarized, and is in compliance with state laws. We update our wills about every five years or so as things change (ie: the kids moved out, we buy or sell a business, we buy or sell a property, etc).Have a Living Will to make your wishes known in the event that you are unable to do this (in my case, I made it very specific that if I am on life support, I want the plug PULLED as quickly as possible. I did this knowing that my hubby, loving as he is, would never even consider making such a decision).Have a Medical Power of Attorney that will give someone you trust the ability to make medical decisions on your behalf in the event you are unable to.Keep a list of financial information in a safe location that your attorney/executor/trusted friend or relative will be able to access in the event of your death. This list should include information on your investments, bank accounts, property, debts, etc. so that the people you left behind will be able to sort out your financial situation if you are not there to help them. Be sure to include with this list other important documents such as birth certificates, marriage certificates, property deeds, military DD214, etc.Have life insurance. The amount you need depends on what kind of financial responsibilities you have. For example, if you are a single person with no dependants, you may only want enough insurance to cover your death expenses (funeral, burial, etc) and clear up your debts, whereas if you are the sole wage earner with a wife and five kids, you will need a significantly larger amount of insurance to cover the family's expenses for a number of years into the future.Have information in writing in regards to what you want to happen to you after death. Do you want to be buried? Cremated? Do you want a wake? Last rites? What are your religious preferences? The most organized lady I know was an elderly neighbor who had everything planned, and paid for, before she died. She had already set up the funeral and burial and all that her friends and few remaining relatives had to do was show up to the memorial service.Be debt free. One of the best ways to help your family after you die is to not leave them a pile of debt. It is hard enough dealing with creditors on a good day but when you are dealing with creditors and grieving at the same time it can be completely overwhelming. If you are debt free (hopefully including the house) that is one less problem you leave your loved ones.Leave a letter to be delivered to your loved one(s) after your death. Your attorney can hold on to this for you or you can keep it in your safe deposit box. The letter should include what you would personally like to say to them as well as other private information you want to share such as internet passwords, information about your online accounts (what do you want to happen to your websites and FaceBook account?), and anything else you don't want to leave unsaid.Get rid of stuff now (or securely hide it in a way that it will disappear when you die) that you don't want your family members to see after you die. Pictures of your new girlfriend? Not a good thing for a grieving wife to find. Evidence of other things you wouldn't be proud of sharing with the world? Do you really need to keep mementos?Preparing for death is never easy or fun, but it can be such a better experience if you do this while you are still alive and healthy as opposed to leaving it to your grieving family members after you die."},
{"title": "The Very Best Place to Shop for Food Is...", "date": "Monday, April 5, 2010", "text": "Ethnic grocery stores in large cities.I went downtown to Seattle today for an appointment and stopped by some of my favorite grocery stores in Chinatown on the way home. Note that ethnic grocery stores in tiny towns don't usually get the traffic and/or competition to have fresh food at low prices, however when you head to an ethnic section of a large city--Chinatown, Little India, etc--the huge amount of competition, the huge number of people who regularly shop at the stores, and the low rent areas that these places usually inhabit mean low prices, super fresh fruits, vegies, meat, and fish, and a lot of healthier food options because many cultures cook from scratch so you will see very few \"processed\" food products.My bag was full today as I got back on the bus to head home. I had fresh shrimp ($2.99 lb), apples (49 cents/lb), beautiful strawberries ($1.19/lb), a huge bag of bean sprouts (49 cents!), cucumbers (39 cents each), bay leaves (89 cents for a good sized bag), fresh green beans (99 cents/lb), dried noodles for soup (89 cents)...you get the idea.There are plenty of places to shop for food in downtown Seattle. Pikes Place Market is famous for having a wide selection of fresh fruits and vegetables, fish (that get thrown for the benefit of the tourists), and artisan cheese and breads (yum), but the exact same fruit and vegetables (without the touristy shops, beautiful displays, and glitzy signs) can be had for a fraction of the cost just by heading to a less trendy part of town where average people shops every day.In these stores you will see some unusual things--people standing literally shoulder to shoulder at the meat counter (no lines here!), most people speaking a language that isn't English, perishables and other food products stacked in boxes like it just came off the truck (which it probably did, so there won't be any fancy displays and most signs will be in a language other than English however you will still be able to decipher the prices, fish being killed and gutted in front of you, and the pervasive smell of fish/durian/etc which can be a shock to people who have never ventured outside of the local Safeway, Stop N Shop, or Piggly Wiggly.A few more things I noticed that is particularly common in immigrant communities: people shop for food every day (it is often their social outlet as well) which means they cook fresh food from scratch every day, they walk from shop to shop (which means they get exercise), they are frugal (many are first generation immigrants), and they are picky (they don't just take a bag of whatever is offered but rather inspect each item they pick up to ensure they are getting the best possible apply or zucchini).The next time you are in a large city, head to the ethnic part of town and check out this wonderful way to shop cheap and healthy."},

{"title": "10 Things That Granddad Taught Me About Money (That I Should Have Paid Attention To)", "date": "Friday, April 2, 2010", "text": "My granddad was a great guy. He always seemed to know a lot about a lot of things. He was a welder by trade but also a horse trainer, a farmer, a show promoter (everything from music concerts to rodeos and fairs), he ran a dance hall in the 40s, and he did any other job that he could pick up to make some money for the family (he lived through the Great Depression which probably shaped his outlook on money for the rest of his life).He taught us plenty as we grew up but perhaps his most important lessons were about money (unfortunately we--his grandkids--grew up during the 70s and though we knew everything and were financial train wrecks...we should have paid attention to granddad). Here are his top ten lessons about money:Pay cash for everything. Period. Of course this was before credit cards were readily available but he never took out bank credit for anything. If he wanted a truck or a house or a piece of land, he saved up for it and paid cash.Save some money out of everything you earn. He never got a paycheck and went out spending like a wild man. In fact, he didn't spend much at all but that is another lesson. He always had a wallet full of cash and cash in a savings account at the bank (he opened savings accounts for us before we could even understand what a bank was).Be frugal. He taught us this in a number of ways. Each Sunday he would take all of the grandkids to the grocery store, each with their own batch of coupons in hand, to do the grocery shopping. I think he was the original Coupon Queen, er, King. If something worked he never replaced it (which explains why their refrigerator dated from the mid 1940s--and grandma used this fridge into the 1990s--and their black and white TV was used until it died in the 1980s).Don't talk about your money. I'm not sure about the origin of this but he never talked about money to anyone. He kept his finances to himself, would never dream of giving out his Social Security number, and would be the last one to show off as a \"big spender\".Want less. He never had lots of material possessions other than the random stuff that is required on a farm. He wouldn't run out and buy the latest appliances, the newest TVs, or any other material goods unless they were necessary. He was supremely content with his home, his land, and his family.If you do buy something, buy it used. Other than going to the store to buy food, I can't ever remember him going to the store to buy new things. He would trade, he would barter, and he would buy used, but he would never buy new. All of his trucks were second hand, his firearms were bought from people who were selling them instead of stores, and even his fishing gear was a hodgepodge of stuff found everywhere but at a store.If you do buy something, buy an asset that will hold its value. He would buy/trade for guitars, knives, firearms, tractors, etc. but he would never buy junk stuff that many people would purchase for $10 then sell at the next yard sale for $1.Have a skill. His theory was that if you were good at a skill (welding, plumbing, construction, etc) you would never go hungry because there would always be people who would need what you could do as opposed to just being a paper pusher who would be expendable.Treat people right. While granddad was tight with is money, he did treat people right. He would take grandma out on a very rare occasion for a hamburger and milkshake. He would see a family in need come to his farm to purchase fruit or vegetables and either give them stuff for free or toss in a few extra pounds at no charge. As a result of this, he had many friends.You can still have vices. Granddad wasn't a saint. He smoked like most men of his generation, he had a fifth of Jack Daniels under the seat of his truck (this was before DUIs were considered a bad thing), and he had a giant Hershey chocolate bar in the cupboard that he would eat one square at a time.I think a lot of us could learn much about money from old timers if we only listened to them. Yes, there are many more options these days than there used to be--DRIPs, ARMs, Roth IRAs, etc--but common sense never goes out of style (although we seemed to have completely forgot this in the 90s). Living beyond your means, investing in things that don't make financial sense, and taking out loans from Payday Lenders are not things that made sense decades ago and they don't make sense today."},

She made the national news, and her blog held everyone's attention as she recorded everything she bought, each meal she was able to create, and each challenge she faced as she worked to prove her point that such a feat was possible.Now there is this lady who was inspired by the previous blogger (and by her lack of money) to see if it would be possible to take the $1 a day challenge to the next level and eat on $1 a day for an entire year. It should be an interesting blog...and an interesting year for the blogger.And here is one more guy who also did a similar experiment."},

Enter the comedy of the absurd (although I am still hoping it will make people pay off their credit card debt faster instead of throwing up their hands in despair). According to this statement...If he only pays the minimum payment each month (about $150, one dollar a month more that what is charged for interest) it will take him 2126 years to pay off the debt and he will have paid a total of $1,718,807.00. Um, yeah...if that doesn't make you want to never touch another credit card I don't know what will.If he pays $377 per month it will only take him three years to pay off this debt with a total payment of $13,573.00 which, the bill helpfully points out, will save him $1,705,235.00 over just paying the minimum amount...ayayay.Which is why we are throwing every available cent at this debt and we hope to have it paid off by the end of the year. I hate credit cards!!!!"},
{"title": "Death By A Thousand Payments", "date": "Saturday, March 27, 2010", "text": "Hubby has a credit card that just won't die.  He doesn't use it any more but with a high interest rate and low payments and a relatively high balance, it seems like we keep paying and paying on it but it never goes away.  Enter my theory based on the \"death by a thousand cuts\" idea.  So instead of the thousand cuts, I figure we will kill this credit card with a thousand payments.  After making the usual payment at the beginning of the month, I was able to make four more payments on the bill this month simply because any time I had extra money (a $50 rebate check, a surprise payment for a freelance article, etc.) I would go online and make additional payments.  I understand that some creditors have a limit on the number of payments they will accept each month, but I figure that by paying extra each week I will #1, not reach the limit on the number of payments I can make, and #2, pay off this bill a whole lot faster by throwing any and all additional money at it."},

{"title": "Bill Reduction 101", "date": "Thursday, March 25, 2010", "text": "One way to have more cash to spend as you like is to have less bills to pay.  This means both a lesser number of bills that you need to pay each month and a lesser amount per bill that you need to pay.  Each year, usually around January, I review our bill list and see what bills I can reduce and what bills I can get rid of all together.  Here's how this looks:Mortgage payment.  At the end of last year we refinanced our mortgage and knocked off both the number of years of payments (from 18 years left on a 20 year contract to 15) and knocked down the interest rate (to 4.5%!).  This resulted in our mortgage payments, even with the reduced number of years, being about $100 less per month than we were paying before.  Also, just this month, I called my car insurance company and asked about their rates for house insurance; turns out that by switching our mortgage insurance to bundle it with our car insurance, we are now saving over $200 per year.Car payments.  This was a biggie--the lease payments for my car were huge so at the end of the lease a couple of years ago, I turned the car in, got a bus pass, decided to share our one paid off car with the hubby...and ended up saving nearly $1000 per month!Credit card bills.  Since we do not use credit cards anymore, we simply pay the minimum on all of the credit card bills then choose the one credit card bill with the lowest balance and hammer away at it until it is gone.  This has reduced the number of credit card bills from eight to three over the past couple of years.  Soon the remaining three should be paid off.  On a side note, if you are still paying off credit card debt, be sure to call the card companies and ask for a reduction in the interest rate you are paying, this can save you a significant amount of money each month.Utilities.  You need electricity, water, sewer, garbage, and natural gas but you can still reduce your rates on these bills by conserving.  We have put low flow shower heads on all of our showers, we turn off lights and other electrical appliances when they are not needed, and we take other steps to conserve both water and electricity.  We also did a bit of research and found that we could switch from weekly garbage pick up to every other week service and save money that way as well.Cable TV.  While cable TV isn't a requirement, most people can't imagine living without it.  Each year we look at this bill and then call the cable company and see if they have a better deal.  Often times this works--they will give us a promotional rate, say a $10 discount on the package that we have, for a year, at which time we call again and see what deals they have available.Phone.  We have done various things over the years to cut the cost of phone service.  In some locations we have had great cell reception so we cut out home phone service all together.  More recently we found that we do need a home phone (mostly for business purposes) so we researched the cost for regular phone company phone service vs. internet phone service and found that by bundling phone service with our internet we save about $20 per month.  Other people have decided to use Skype in lieu of phone service, or switched to using cell phones only.  Cell phones.  It always pays to review the various cell phone service plans frequently as they change often.  You need to be aware of any pre-term cancellation fees you may be under before switching over, but it does pay to keep an eye on both the cell service packages that are available and also check to make sure that you are paying for the most cost-efficient service level (ie: if you only use 500 minutes a month, why would you want to be in a 1500 minute per month plan?).Car insurance.  We try to make sure that our car insurance plan meets our needs, both in terms of the rate we are paying as compared to the rates offered by other companies, and in the type of insurance we are paying for (ie: when the value of the car drops below a certain amount, we will take off comprehensive insurance and just go with liability).Variable expenses.  This category, which includes food, gas, clothing, entertainment, etc., has the most room in which to make a dent in the amount that you spend.  In these areas, we tend to spend like misers (in a good sort of way).  Food is bought on sale, we conserve gas by organizing our trips in the most efficient manner, clothing is bought at 50% off or more clearance sales, and entertainment is often a movie at home or a walk around the park.  We realize that by living frugally in these easy-to-be-frugal categories, we have more cash on hand to spend on the things that are most important to us (like traveling to visit the family).Extraneous expenses.  We have cut out many expenses over the last few years that simply lopped these categories right out of our budget (and resulted in fewer bills to pay each month).  These include cancelling the yard guy, the housekeeper, the gym membership, subscriptions to newspapers and magazines, etc. By simply reviewing your bill list each year and considering your options, you can literally save hundreds of dollars per month (which can be better spent to pay down debt, bulk up your emergency fund, or pay for your CASH ONLY vacation)."},
{"title": "20 Things Completed This Weekend (That Were Free And/Or Made Us Money)", "date": "Sunday, March 21, 2010", "text": "It is a beautiful sunny weekend here. Warmth and sun make me want to get active. Unlike a few years back, when a warm sunny day would send me on a recreational shopping binge, I now do things differently. Usually these things are both productive and cost little money. Here's what we did this weekend:Went for a walk around the neighborhood. Actually it's the first time this year I have seen many of our neighbors out in their yards. Usually people around here hibernate from November to March and you rarely ever see them unless they are running to their cars.Took some photos and listed some of the bigger stuff that is taking up space in the garage on Craigslist.Semi-organized the garage so that all of the excess stuff we have collected over the winter will be easy to set out at the garage sale we plan to have next month.Caught up on cooking and baking. Among the simple home-made items I usually make every couple of weeks: yogurt (super simple), granola (ditto), cookies (chocolate chip), chili, soup from the leftover chicken which we ate for dinner on Sunday (now in the freezer), and fried rice (for dinner and the leftovers are packaged for lunch for the next couple of days).Cleaned out the junk drawer. I thought we were out of batteries but hubby cleaned out the junk drawer and found an extra package in there...saves us money to not have to run out and buy a package of batteries that we didn't need.Cleaned out our closets. Clothes and shoes that we no longer wear were separated for the garage sale and donation to a local charity.Mowed the yard. Myself. Even though the temptation to hire it done was there, I figured I could use the exercise and the extra money I would save by doing it myself.Washed the car. Hubby did this. Usually we spend the $10 it takes to run it through the local car wash, but again, we NEED the exercise, we have the time, it is a nice sunny day, and we have all of the stuff to wash the car so we figured we might as well do it ourself.Watched the news. The health care thing is all that is on the news this weekend. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.Shopped virtually. I do this each Sunday when the store ads come out. I used to go to the store, pick up the advertisement, then shop. Unfortunately, by doing this, I usually ended up buying stuff--much of which I didn't need but couldn't pass up because it was \"on sale.\" Now on Sunday mornings, I sit down at my computer and check out each local store's advertisement. This is a great way to curb impulse shopping and there has to be something that I both really need, and at a really good price, to make me leave my home and go buy it.Watched a movie on my computer. We do have basic cable but we haven't rented movies or actually gone out to the movies in ages. I was Googling a movie I heard about (the movie is Tim from the 1970s with a very young--and quite hot--Mel Gibson). I saw that someone had posted the movie, in its entirety, on YouTube so I watched it online for free. How cool!Passed up the opportunity to go to the symphony. A friend called with an extra set of tickets for the symphony--for free. I was so tired from the past week that I thanked her but declined. Now I am kicking myself--what a great, FREE, opportunity. Note to self, always say YES to opportunities.Cleaned out the fridge. I do this every couple of weeks and it occurred to me that one of my future challenges will be to see how long we can go with eating only what food we have at home and not eating out or restocking at the grocery store. Judging by the amount of stuff I saw in the fridge and the cabinets, we could be eating at home for months!Pondered the new \"cash for clunker appliances\" offer. Our state recently started offering a $100 rebate for buying new appliances (refrigerators and washing machines). While buying these items in on our \"to do\" list, we are putting this off until after we have the garage sale and thus, the cash to pay for the appliances we want. Did our taxes. Actually I did my taxes, my nephews taxes, and my sister in law's taxes. The more you make, the more you pay. Bummer.Hosted friends for dinner. Some friends came into town on Friday and invited us out to dinner (cost to them $100+). On Saturday, we invited them IN for dinner. A few years ago we would have felt that their invitation required that we take them out at an even more expensive restaurant than they took us to. No more keeping up with the Joneses. Hubby is a wonderful cook and everyone had some great food (cost to us about $25), some great conversation, and some great memories (from the after dinner poker game we set up).Researched some vacation packages online. Some family members are holding a mini-reunion in Las Vegas in June. We told them we would be there, with a couple of caveats. First, we need to have the cash to pay for the airline tickets, hotel, and spending money. Second, we have to get a \"good deal\" on these items. Round trip airline tickets from our location to Vegas were at $255 each as of this weekend which is more than I want to pay. Either the price will come down or we won't go. We like to vacation but only when the price is right.Got some work done. This is more for psychological peace than financial peace. I have a lot of leeway when it comes to completing work. Often times I put off work that I don't want to do until the last minute which causes undue stress. This morning was quiet with nothing pressing to do so I sat down at my desk and forced myself to write two big reports I was putting off (and surprisingly it went much more easily than I though it would). Now my upcoming week will be very quiet and relaxing.Arranged to car pool. A few years back it was nothing to hop in my car and go to meetings which were hours away. I put a massive amount of miles on my (leased) car. Dumb. On Friday afternoon, I asked around to see who was going to a meeting on Monday and another on Thursday, and was able to get rides with other people to both meetings. Found out my sister got engaged. Actually she sent me a picture of her finger. It was a blurry picture and from a phone number I didn't know so I figured someone accidentally sent me a picture of their finger. Odd. But after we chatted and I found out she was getting married--thus the picture of a ring on her finger--and I started rattling off all of the ways we could give her a great wedding at really minimal cost (unlike her huge and expensive first wedding which she was still paying off after the divorce decree had been issued). Surprisingly she was very agreeable and it looks like I will have a great topic for a blog post ('Wonderful weddings for next to nothing') in about eight months.Overall a wonderful weekend, very productive, and, happily, very inexpensive."},
{"title": "A \"Know Your Prices\" Reminder", "date": "Sunday, March 14, 2010", "text": "A few weeks ago, a major store in our area announced that it was closing.  I went in the next day and they seemed to have some pretty good prices (their ads for that week were still in affect plus they had a 20% off \"store closing\" discount).  I bought a few things then figured I would go back in a couple of weeks when we got back from vacation to see if anything was left and to see if even deeper discounts were being offered. Yesterday I went back to the store and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  There were big \"STORE CLOSING 30%-50% OFF\" signs all over the place but when I looked at some of the toiletries that I was interested in buying, I noted that someone had taken a price gun and marked every single bottle of shampoo, package of soap, tubes of toothpaste, etc. with new HIGHER prices.  Of course I didn't buy anything--even with the \"discount\", the higher prices meant I would be paying about the same as I would pay for the items at other stores in the area.This was an excellent reminder of how important it is to have a price book, or similar way to remember what the average prices are that you pay for the most common items that you buy.  People who don't pay attention to prices may come into this store and look at the signs and think they are getting a good deal when in reality they are getting ripped off!"},
{"title": "A Rave: Reaching Your Goals, Step By Step", "date": "Thursday, March 11, 2010", "text": "Last week I ranted about some friends that we visited when we were on vacation. Today I want to rave about another couple of friends that we also visited while we were on vacation.This couple seems to be doing everything right, financially speaking. Not only do they both work and earn good incomes, they live below their means, bank some (which has allowed them to go on some amazing vacations at the drop of a hat, because they had the cash to do it), and spend the rest, step by step, to reach their goals.One of their main goals is to have a beautiful home and share it with friends and family. The way they have accomplished this is by taking small steps, which over the course of 25+ years, has resulted in an amazing home, a wonderful family, and friends that tend to \"just show up\" from all over the world to enjoy (even temporarily) a part of their dream. Here's how this came about:They bought a small ranch house that was built in the '50s about 25 years ago. The house was not much to look at but it was in a good location, on a nice piece of land, and they could easily afford the payments. Since that day so long ago, they have set about turning their humble, little house into a showplace. As their kids will attest, the \"family project\" has been an ongoing renovation of this home that is still going on 25 years later (at the dinner party they invited us to, the topic of conversation was getting everyone's input on wallpaper for the downstairs office which opened up a spirited and lively discussion). Their house is, hands down, the most amazing place I have ever seen. I wanted to take pictures but there was people everywhere so I couldn't get any photos of the home without people in them. They have literally redone every part of their house. A once hand-dug basement is now completely finished with beautiful wood floors, a family game room, an office, and walk-out guest quarters. The back yard has been turned into a beautiful Japanese garden complete with rock gardens, waterfalls, an amazing deck, and quaint foot bridges. The kitchen is a work of art with marble counter tops, top of the line appliances, and cabinets that are to-die-for. Then there is the huge master bedroom that is an oasis of tranquility with a huge master bath (the stone shower rocks!), and a walk in closet that you could get lost in.As impressed as I am with the \"wow\" factor of their home, I am even more impressed with the way they accomplished this goal. They made a plan (to renovate the house) then approached the plan with a cash-only outlook. As they had the cash, they would buy the paint for a room, the stones for the floor, the lumber for the deck. They didn't take out loans to speed up the project and they didn't spend more money than they had. If they wanted a higher quality product (imported marble) they would work on a more labor intensive project (the garden) while they saved up for the purchase of the marble. The result is that they have created a wonderful, welcoming home that is always filled with family and friends, and best of all, they are able to thoroughly enjoy themselves with the people they want to fill their life with because they are not stressed out about money, they aren't in debt or living beyond their means, they take genuine pride in their hard work and accomplishments, and people can actually feel the positive energy of this family as they, step by step, reach their goals. This is an excellent example of how anyone can take their goal, break it down, then move forward with little steps (and with cash only) to create amazing things in their life."},
{"title": "10 Ways to Learn from Dave Ramsey", "date": "Tuesday, March 9, 2010", "text": "Dave Ramsey is my favorite financial guru, bar none. Lots of financial writers can fill up a book with a whole bunch of words and lots of financial writers have carved out niches which get them a lot of publicity via books, TV, and the internet. Not so many writers, actually none except Dave, give you simple, step by step instructions on how to get out of debt an become rich.While other financial gurus are preaching about 401ks and flipping houses, Dave starts at the very beginning for those of us who are slow (or those of us who don't really want to hear the truth because it my be painful)...step 1, get a $1000 emergency fund NOW!, step 2, cut up ALL of your credit cards, get a second or third job, stop spending, and pay off all of your debt. See--painful. But effective. I can honestly say that Dave is the only person in MY ENTIRE LIFE who said \"you are an idiot because you are spending yourself into massive debt. Don't be stupid.\" And for some of us, that's what we need to hear because we can come up with all kinds of excuses to justify how bad we are with money. But after you get with the program, much like running a marathon, you hit the wall of pain and pass it because you become so blissed out with your progress that your whole mindset changes. Now I (and apparently millions of others) are no longer victims of our poor choices and of the media/financial/Joneses that we are keeping up with, and we are making significant progress in our financial lives (and overall in our personal lives too) so now I want to evangelize Dave to the world! Here are ten ways to learn how to get out of debt and become wealthy from Dave Ramsey:Check out his website.Listen to his radio program online.Listen to his radio program in your car or at home.Catch him on TV.Download a podcast.Attend a live event.Read his books.Follow him on Twitter.Attend Financial Peace University.Join the Dave community."},
{"title": "A Rant...Just Me Being Judgemental", "date": "Sunday, March 7, 2010", "text": "In the interest of politeness, I thought I would rant here instead of, like, to the people I am ranting about.  With the disclaimer that I am a born-again frugalista who has probably done everything on the list that I am about to rant about...That being said, we are on vacation this week visiting friends and family.  One family we visited spends like maniacs and all I can do is sit in awe of their financial stupidity.  Other than that, they are wonderfully nice, super intelligent people, but when you look at the financial mess they are in, you seriously wonder how well educated (one is a PhD) people with a stellar income (around $250,000 annually) could make so many financial mistakes.  They are hiding from bill collector calls, are in massive debt, and buy stuff continually.  As Dave Ramsey says, you can't out earn stupid and he is definitely right.  Here's what I have observed during my stay here:They eat out nearly every day, often breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the whole family.  Yes they are busy but they could rearrange their schedule to fit in simple meal making.They bribe their kids with stuff.  The kids have a ton of stuff...every Wii game made, racks of DVD movies, expensive electronics, a massive amount of toys that they don't even have time to play with, etc.They use credit for paying for everything from gas to food to clothes to...everything else.There is only two drivers in the family yet they have three expensive cars (with loans) sitting in the drive way.They have debt collectors calling them EVERY day to the point that they are afraid to answer the phone.They have a couple of great vacations planned.They rave about how great their time share is.They classify one of their businesses as a real business yet it never breaks even or makes a profit and is a constant financial drain (in other words, it is a very expensive hobby).They feel justified buying anything they want because they work hard for their \"great\" income.  Actually they are working themselves to death to buy a whole lot of junk.They don't know how much money they have.  Literally when you ask about certain expenses they will say it is \"about\" x amount, or that they don't know because they have someone else take care of that stuff that they don't understand, etc.They keep up appearances by having the things that other people in their profession/social class have...big house, nice pool, very expensive cars, etc.Anyway, those are the most annoying things.  Like I said, I have probably done all of the above at one time or another in my life but after changing my financial life, looking at other people making these sort of mistakes is practically painful.  You can't really lecture adults who don't want to hear what you are saying and trying to lead by example seems to fall on deaf ears (I mentioned that I got rid of ALL of my credit cards and now pay cash for purchases large and small and they both said \"we can't do that because...\" followed by a half dozen excuses that, yes, I myself had given in the past).If I could help them, here's what I would do:Sell everything in their house.  Then sell the house and put them into a small house with a small house payment.Get rid of the cars and have them each buy a $5000 car with cash.Insist that they eat every meal at home (or taken from home), even if it means picking one day a month and doing some production cooking for the freezer.Take away all of their credit cards/checks/debit cards and give them a daily allowance.  This is the fastest way to learn to live on cash only.Pay off their debts so fast it would make their heads spin.  Unlike many Americans who would need to take on second and third jobs in order to pay their debts, these people have a huge income.  They could ratchet back to living on $50,000 per year and throw $200,000 per year at their debts!Ditch the time share, the vacations, the expensive cable packet which gives them every cable channel offered, etc.Put an end to bribing kids (or spouses for that matter) with money or things.  If you want the kids to do something, you explain what you want and give them consequences if they don't do it instead of pleading with them to do something then giving them a reward every time they make a half-assed effort to do it.  Ditto for spouses (sometimes it is easier to give a spouse something to make them happy or compliant instead of creating an environment of good communication).I think that's all.  I'll hop off my soapbox now, stop being so bitchy, and enjoy the rest of my (cash only) vacation."},
{"title": "101 Free Activities", "date": "Friday, March 5, 2010", "text": "When you are in debt or trying desperately to get out of debt, you simply don't want to/can't spend money on \"frivolous\" things, like activities to keep yourself and the family amused and entertained.  Unfortunately, without some sort of regular diversion, you may go stir crazy or get depressed because life looks like a big, bleak slog instead of a fun, interesting adventure.  Here's 101 free activities to consider that are free (just be sure to bring a lunch and beverages from home) and entertaining:Rent free DVD and VCR movies from the library.Borrow books from the library.Take the family to story time and other community activities at the library or local book store.Go on a nature walk/hike close to home.Walk with the Volksmarchers (free if you aren't a member; non-members are welcome to participate).Check online to see when your local museum/zoo/other attraction offers free entrance (often the first Tuesday or Thursday of the month).Volunteer to help out at an event (fair, community event, play) in exchange for a free entrance pass for you and the family.Bake cookies or create other dishes at home.Make a fort inside or outside with the kids (only requires blankets and a way to hang them up).Take photos around your community with your digital camera.Check out local activities at your local school (elementary, junior high, high school, or college).

Popcorn and pranks optional.Check out the community events section of your city's newspaper (free outdoor movies, concerts in the park, and other free events are a great source of entertainment).Google for coupons for local vendors (occasionally you will be able to find free passes for the local skating rink, etc).Make a snowman, or if you are more industrious, an igloo, after a heavy snowfall.Make your own toys (like kites, boats, cars) with items you have laying around and see if your work will fly, float, or go. Do craft projects with items you can find for free (everything from toilet paper rolls to rocks and leaves).Set up a scavenger hunt for the kids by hiding clues and trinkets then making a map for them to follow.Have a garage sale, not only will you make money but the kids can set up a lemonade or hot dog stand and make their own cash.Volunteer (everything from the soup kitchen to the zoo to the local hospital love to have volunteers help out).Go dumpster diving (radical but fun!).Learn and practice some outdoor skills (as kids we spent hours building forts, sleeping outside, creating snares to catch rabbits, making bows and arrows, etc).Have a small bonfire and roast marshmallows.Watch a scary movie on TV then tell ghost stories afterwards (not for the faint of heart).People watch then make up stories about them (ie: the lady in blue is really a princess from a foreign country and she is hiding out in our town, etc).Enter a contest.

Put together a neighborhood soccer/baseball/stick ball game.Glean free food (pick wild mushrooms if you know which ones are safe, pick berries that grow along the roadside, pick apples from trees--legally of course, etc).Go fishing (many counties/states offer a free day of fishing when you don't need a license) even if you have to make your own pole.Barter.

{"title": "Buying to Meet Your Needs", "date": "Wednesday, March 3, 2010", "text": "One way to save a whole bunch of money is to buy in a way that meets your needs instead of buying the \"absolute best\" that is available.  Here's some examples:When I buy a computer, I buy my favorite brand (HP) but I never buy a top of the line computer.  Because I don't do any gaming on my computer or crunch PhD level numbers, I get by just fine with what equates to a bargain basement computer which has everything I need to do the (mostly writing) stuff that I do.  I know \"tech envy\" can drive people to think they need every possible bell and whistle on their computer, thus leaving them with a $2,000 machine that will be obsolete practically before they get the thing unwrapped.  Don't let this happen to you.  Know what you need before you shop for an expensive item and stay true to your list instead of having your head turned by a convincing salesperson and the shiny new models that are on display.Vacations can cost as much or as little as you want to spend.  I know very wise people who spend like maniacs on and for their vacation.  One friend has to have an entire new wardrobe when she goes on vacation.  She totally doesn't get that the people who see her on vacation have never seen her before and will never see her again and therefore they wouldn't even know that the clothes she was wearing were worn for a month instead of bought the day before she got on the airplane.  If she were buying to meet her needs--to have fashionable clothes to wear on vacation--she would actually end up buying nothing because all of her regular clothes are just fine for vacation.  Ditto for places to stay (a multi-thousand dollar time share is most often overkill when compared to the cost of a basic hotel), places to eat (most cities have great ethnic areas where food is awesome and cheap; the five star restaurant is definitely a \"want\" and not a need). and modes of transportation (first class and coach passengers tend to arrive at their destination at the same time, even though one set of passengers has spent a whole lot more money for their seat).Food is a huge area where money can be spent to meet your actual needs and not the fictitious needs generated by the advertising companies, thus saving you $$$.  For example, you need to feed your kids breakfast.  An egg and toast or oatmeal are wonderfully nutritious and cheap breakfasts.  Frosty-fruity-look at the toy in the box cereals are not only hugely expensive compared to oatmeal or eggs but they are much less nutritious.  Ditto for the steak you can buy on sale compared to the steak you spend and arm and leg for at a five-star restaurant.  Consumer items are infinitely flexible when it comes to price vs. needs.  The last season jeans which are cheaper, and look just like, this season's jeans are a bargain.  Finding them barely used at the thrift store is an even better bargain.  And the two year old Mercedes as opposed to the brand new Mercedes that drops a quarter of its value as soon as you drive it off the lot can be a bargain if you absolutely need a Mercedes (otherwise go for the highly rated, used generic car that will serve the purpose of getting you where you need to go).The bottom line is that if you spend your money to meet your actual needs as opposed to the needs you see expressed on TV that are meant to separate you from your hard earned cash, you will not only have met your needs but also have some money left over."},
{"title": "10 Cheap Disaster Preps", "date": "Friday, February 26, 2010", "text": "Being prepared isn't something that you can \"buy\" and be done with it and then you will be all ready for any disaster that may strike your area.  Rather preparedness is a series of ongoing tasks which will allow you to be more knowledgeable and more ready when a crisis occurs.  Instead of thinking money when you think about disaster preparedness, think of the basics--things that you can do/use/have in the event of any type of disaster that may occur.To get started, here are ten simple, and cheap, ways you can prepare for a disaster:Make sure you have working smoke detectors with fresh batteries.  People are much more likely to die in a fire than in a tsunami, earthquake, or hurricane.  Something as simple and cheap as a smoke detector can save the lives of you and your family.  Note that some fire departments provide these free of charge.Learn CPR and first aid.  Another way someone is more likely to die (considering that  cardiac disease is THE leading cause of death in the US) is due to heart attack.  The way to be prepared for this, and be able to save a life, is to know CPR, AED use, and basic first aid.  The best part is that these classes are often offered free of charge at local fire departments, hospitals, and the Red Cross.Do you have enough food stored to eat for a week during a disaster? You don't need fancy MREs and high tech freeze-dried foods which cost a whole lot.  Rather, you can take $21 down to your local grocery store, buy 21 cans of soup, and there you have your food for a week.  Simple.Another critical item you need to be prepared for a disaster is water.  You can live quite a long time without food but everyone needs water within a couple of days or they will die.  Putting aside one gallon of water per person per day for a week is simple and cheap.  Five gallon water containers can be purchased at Walmart for a couple of dollars each and there you have your emergency water supply.  Just be sure to rotate the water regularly.One of people's first needs after a disaster is information.  After many disasters, power is out, thus no TV, no internet, and no charging your iPhone.  The remedy?  A cheap AM/FM radio can be your connection to the outside world after a disaster and what is even better is the fact that a simple radio is actually very inexpensive.A first aid kit can be bought as one big kit or you can make your own.  This is another low cost item that can offer big dividends after a disaster (or even during a particularly bad cold and flu season).Flashlights (and batteries) are a must have during a disaster.  Even a simple power outage can be a disaster if your house is pitch black and you have no source of light.  Flashlights are simple, cheap items that you can buy for a couple of dollars each.  Just make sure you buy one for each family member--having five people share one flashlight would be a disaster in itself.Ten items from the dollar store that will help you out during a disaster: a whistle, a pair of work gloves, a breaker bar, a dust mask, a manual can opener, a bottle of bleach for water purification, a box of matches, a packet of moist towelettes, duct tape, big plastic garbage bags.  An emergency evacuation bag is important.  Many times people need to evacuate with only the clothes on their backs (think wild fires, chemical spills, etc).  A $10 backpack from Walmart into which you put a change of clothes and toiletries can make a simple evacuation bag that you can keep at the ready in a downstairs closet in case you must leave at a moment's notice.Your spare time is a valuable (and free) commodity for emergency planning.  If you take the time to make an emergency communications plan, practice regular fire drills with the family, practice stop, drop, and hold earthquake drills with the kids, make back up copies of your computer files and important papers, and do a bit of research (like finding out what your community's emergency sirens sound like, where the closest evacuation shelter is, or what your children's school emergency plan is) you will be much more prepared than the average person in the event of an emergency.Disaster preparedness doesn't have to be an expensive, overwhelming task.  Simple steps, done regularly, can get you and your family prepared in no time and at very low cost."},
{"title": "What If This Happened to You?", "date": "Tuesday, February 23, 2010", "text": "By \"this\" I mean this guys situation.  I was browsing through reddit just now and saw this guy's post.  He is an independent contractor who just found out his client is bankrupt and he has about $12 in his bank account.  And since he is a contractor, he probably isn't entitled to unemployment and all of those other neat little perks that employees get.  Bummer.This is a situation that anyone could find themselves in at some point in their life.  There have been quite a few news articles of people going to work one morning only to find the doors padlocked and no more job.  Like many things, we think that sort of thing only happens to 'other' people but the truth is, it could happen to you or me.  Which means everyone should start today, immediately, to get themselves into a better position so that if such a scenario happens in your life, you will have something better to fall back on than the $12 in your checking account.  Here's what to do:Have an emergency fund of at least $1000 NOW.  Sell things if you have to, even your blood if you have to, in order to accomplish this goal as quickly as possible.Get out of debt.  A crisis is much easier to handle if you don't have creditors calling your house twenty times a day because you are late on your debt payment.Have multiple streams of income.  Actually, the more sources of income you have coming into your life each month, the less the loss of one client will affect you both financially and psychologically.  If your entire life is wrapped around one employer or one client, you literally have all of your eggs in one basket.  Consider a part time job, a side business, selling products online, watching the neighbors kids after school if this fits in with your life style, taking random temporary jobs such as being a census worker, etc.Have people in your life that you can rely on.  The better your support network, the better you will be able to get through tough times (ie: a friend who would let you live on their couch for a while, a mom who will do your laundry, a friend who will bring you dinner, etc).Never stop networking and developing connections in your field and in your social life.  The fact is that rumors about businesses heading downhill often are heard around the water cooler prior to something major happening like the doors being locked.  Another fact is that should you need another job, most of the best job referrals come through friends and business acquaintances who know you and know your work and will give you a lead on a great job AND put in a good word for you.Should you do the above and still find yourself in the unenviable position as the guy in the reddit post, here are some things to do immediately:Take advantage of resources that are available to you.  This can be everything from an employee severance package or unemployment to the local food bank or community job re-training program.Give yourself about five minutes of panic and a half hour pity party then move forward.  Sometimes this sort of setback can lead people into a lengthy downward spiral.  Don't let a temporary setback create an extended problem in your life.  Look forward, move forward, and keep doing so until you get back on better footing. Ratchet back your lifestyle immediately.  Cut the cable and the home phone, stop eating out AT ALL, trade in the weekly movie night at the theater for a cozy movie night at home with a free movie from the library, etc.Look for a great full time job but don't overlook some cool part time jobs that could provide you the flexibility to work while also having time to build job skills, develop a business, or go back to school.An unexpected job loss is never a good thing, but if you are prepared, it won't be a catastrophe and may actually open the doors to bigger and better things."},
{"title": "Is It Possible to Diet on the Cheap?", "date": "Thursday, February 18, 2010", "text": "I am not in the obese category but my blogger butt sure isn't getting any smaller. I waiver between the need for nutritious food and exercise and my love for junk food and surfing the net way more than I should.The exercising on the cheap part was taken care of in the last post (now all I have to do is actually get out and do it) but many people say that dieting always involves spending lots of money--from the extreme of paying for lap band surgery ($$$$) to joining Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers ($$$) to buying special (read, expensive) food ($$). I have been kicking around the idea of a modified Paleo diet and thought that I would give it a try for a week, both to determine its effectiveness and to see if it really does cost more for food.I'll update this post each day for a week with the food I ate and the estimated cost just to see what happens.THURSDAYBreakfast--Banana 20 centsLunch--Tuna salad wrapped in lettuce leaves $1Snack--Raisins and walnuts 75 centsDinner--Lentil soup, salad, chicken in Thai sauce $2Notes--yesterday my diet included cereal with milk, a burger for lunch, potato chips, almost an entire box of Girl Scout thin mints, and a blended coffee and ice cream beverage. Today's food was like a 180 change. I'm craving a Frapuccino!FRIDAYBreakfast--hard boiled egg, boiled apple with cinnamon 65 centsLunch--chicken caesar salad $0 (client paid for it)Snack--banana and strawberries $1Dinner--tiny piece of steak, corn, salad, sweet potato $1.50Dessert--two dried dates 20 centsNotes--feel crappy and rather sick, mostly head cold stuff. I hope this is just my body detoxing.SATURDAYBreakfast--hard boiled egg, boiled apple with cinnamon, sweet potatoes 95 centsTrail lunch--hard boiled egg, raisins and peanuts, grapes 95 centsDinner--lentil soup, salad, corn, couple small chunks of chicken $1.25Notes--felt super energetic early this morning so decided to walk a half marathon with our local Volksmarch group. Afterwords my horrible head cold returned and now my body feels like it has been hit by a truck because I am basically so out of shape. Can't believe I ate healthy for three days in a row, I think this is some sort of record!SUNDAYBreakfast--strawberries, raisins, peanuts 75 centsLunch--potato salad, corn chips and salsa 65 centsSnack--cashews 50 centsDinner--baked cod, asparagus $1.25Notes--still have the horrible head cold which is why I think I am not eating much (see comment from reader) since I never feel like eating if I am sick. Went to the grocery store today to get groceries and realized that (following the Paleo diet principles) you can't eat about 95% of what is in the store! According to the Paleo diet principles, you should only eat meat, fruit, vegies, and nuts/seeds, no dairy, grains of any type, legumes, or root vegetables. I'm fairly sure I couldn't do such a restrictive diet long-term (also see comment from reader), mostly because I don't really like to eat much meat and my two favorite food groups are dairy and grains! Some modifications are definitely in order but so far my body actually feels pretty good (no bloating or the highs and lows you get from caffeine). We'll see what happens in the next few days of this experiment...MONDAYBreakfast--banana, tangerine, potato salad 90 centsLunch--baked chicken, asparagus $1.50Snack--corn chips and salsa 50 centsDinner--lentil soup, salad $1.25Notes--cold is all gone and I feel great, one of the faster recoveries I have enjoyed. Finding that I seriously could not do a Paleo diet for very long--I don't eat much meat and this diet is all about meat (ick...kind of), I've eaten so many eggs this week I don't want to look at another hard boiled egg, and I love fruit and vegetables but when all you have to look forward to is fruit and vegetables and meat forever...no thanks. Obviously this isn't a true Paleo diet because I have thrown in potatoes, sweet potatoes, and corn chips just for some solid \"food\". Think I would rather die happy and well fed at 60 than miserable and skinny at 80...~~End of Experiment~~Conclusions: radical diets are just too radical for me. To answer the original question, yes it is possible to diet on the cheap. The Paleo diet is supposed to be one of the more expensive diets to do and I guess it would cost more than I have recorded to sustain the average 1800-2000 calorie a day intake of meat, fruit, and vegies because you have to eat a WHOLE LOT of these items to replace the calories you would usually get when including grains and tuberous vegetables in your diet. However, even though I wasn't thrilled about this this experiment, I realized that over the last five days I have saved a whole bunch of money on junk food, fast food, and treats like a frap at Starbucks. I think when people say they can't afford good, nutritious food, they don't stop to add up the money they spend on junk food, eating out, picking up treats as you pass by the local convenience store, or grabbing a drink each morning at your favorite coffee stand.I think I will keep some of the things I have learned--like eating three meals a day with a small snack (as opposed to grazing throughout the day which allows you can eat a lot of calories and not even realize it), cutting back on wheat and dairy because I believe I am sensitive to these items, but definitely adding back grains like rice and legumes such as beans which tend to make up most of my favorite foods.As the comment below states...lifestyle change is the name of the game not restrictive dieting."},
{"title": "Bag the Gym Membership and Exercise for Free", "date": "Monday, February 15, 2010", "text": "I know people who are still paying for a monthly membership to use the local gym, some actually use their memberships but most don't after the first rush of \"I'm gonna get in shape-itis\".  Anyway, with the economy in the toilet and people having less and less money to spare on something they may not even use, consider these free ways you can exercise and get in shape without all of the expense:Mall walking.  Simply go to your local mall and walk!  It's easy, it's free, it's indoors and out of the weather.  Best of all, many malls have actual mall walking clubs, lots of great people to walk with, and some even open extra early so you can walk before the mall stores open and shoppers arrive.TV exercise classes.  One of my favorite yoga classes actually comes to me via the television each morning.  There are also quite a few morning exercise classes on TV that you can follow along with and with cable/streaming video/free exercise videos from the library, you can actually exercise any time you want.Weight lifting...with groceries.  Yes you can go out and buy a whole collection of hand weights or you can wander over to the pantry and start lifting cans of veggies, jugs of milk, or any other item that is a bit weighty and fits your hands.Play outside, either by yourself of with your kids.  When you are a kid, you can think of all kinds of things to do outside--kick a ball down the street, play hide and seek, hang on the monkey bars at the playground--basically everything looks fun when you are a kid.  If you adopt the same attitude now, you will find all kinds of things to do outside that will give you some exercise and will actually be a lot of fun.Borrow fitness facilities.  Does your local high school have a great track or a nice set of outdoor bleachers to run?  Is there a nature trail near by?  Are there community tennis courts nearby?  Is there a lake where you can swim?  There are usually quite a few community-developed places that anyone can use to exercise.  Obviously you will want to use school facilities on weekends when the school is closed and public tennis or basketball courts assume that you have the equipment (tennis rackets, basketball) to use them.Volunteer.  One way that many people get to exercise for free is by volunteering at the place where they want to exercise.  Years ago I volunteered at a dance studio and ended up getting my dance classes for free.  Some people volunteer at the Y and in return get free passes to use the Y facilities.Participate in community groups.  Cultural dance groups, meet up groups, hiking groups, bicycling clubs...many communities have groups of people who share the same interest in various types of exercise activities so why not join one?Some more difficult stuff.  Parkour is a cool sport which requires nothing else but your bravery and what ever obstacles are naturally in your way.  You can also find the tallest building in your city and climb the steps to the top, scramble up mountain trails, or even participate in a fight club (something I highly recommend NOT to do).The bottom line is that you don't need to spend a lot of money or obligate yourself to expensive plans in order to exercise and get fit.  With a little creativity and just by getting out and actually doing stuff, you can enjoy a wide range of free exercise activities."},
{"title": "Good Things About the Bad Economy", "date": "Thursday, February 11, 2010", "text": "Yes the economy is in the pits and people are broke and jobs are being lost at an amazing rate but there are some good things about this situation that people often overlook:People aren't spending like crazy and living beyond their means anymore, mostly because they can't get the credit to live this way these days. This is a good thing. People are coming back to reality.Families are spending more time together (mostly because parents are working reduced hours or are out of work and they can't afford to send each family member off to do their own thing). This is also good. Working together as a family, especially during hard times actually raises self esteem, teaches problem solving, gets rid of the \"I'm entitled\" attitude, and forces you to learn to work together and enjoy time together...mostly because you don't have any other options.Prices are lower. People are willing to make deals because business is much slower than usual. Restaurants in my area are offering some pretty significant discounts. Houses are selling at super low prices (like 1/3 off what they were selling for only a few years ago). And, I am getting new flooring installed in my house this week (of course cash only) because the home improvement store had a great sale on the linoleum AND business is so slow for flooring installers that a guy I know offered my a \"can't beat this\" price to install the flooring.People are learning how to do things for themselves. When our kids were growing up, we had plenty of money for all kinds of things--designer coffee, meals out, shopping for whatever looked interesting at the grocery store. This wasn't so good. They missed out on lots of lessons that I learned from my Depression-era grandparents like how to shop within a budget, how to cook, how to pack a lunch for work the next day out of leftovers...basically all of the frugal living skills that practically died out during the '90s and early 2000s.People are learning what it means to live within their means. If you don't have/can't get credit then you can't buy/can't charge the new TV, laptop, or car that just a few years ago was as simple as signing on the dotted line. Now you can only buy what you can afford. Whatta concept!If you turn this current financial situation on its head, you can find all kinds of things to be thankful for while most people are only looking at the down side.  And, if you need more convincing that money won't buy happiness, check out this article where a guy gives away all of him money so that he can be happier."},
{"title": "What Would You Do for $10,000?", "date": "Tuesday, February 9, 2010", "text": "Well, I'll tell you what I would do. Today I applied, for the first time in my life, to enter a \"reality\" type contest where the prize, if you can vanish for a month, is $10,000. I saw this contest advertised a couple of days ago and thought \"I could actually do that\" as opposed to say Survivor (I don't eat insects) or Amazing Race (I don't go face first down a 25 story building no matter how many ropes are tied to me). But could I actually disappear and evade a small army of people trying to find me? Me thinks yes. So I downloaded and filled out the application, rounded up a few (not so great) photos of myself, and spent hours trying to figure out how the video camera works so that I could make a two minute video of myself as part of the application (I'm hoping they put more weight on the written application as opposed to my oh-so-unprofessional video). There is probably a one in a million chance that I would actually be selected and then, if selected, a one in a million chance I could evade some of the best techies in the US trying to hunt me down but it is so worth the opportunity to try. Plus that $10,000 would really come in handy to help me reach my 400 goals!"},
{"title": "El Cheapo Weekend", "date": "Sunday, February 7, 2010", "text": "We generally spend our weekends doing fun but inexpensive activities.  During our spending heyday, it would be nothing to spend hundreds of dollars over the course of a weekend on eating out, getting a manicure and pedicure, buying clothes and shoes, going to the movies, buying new \"toys\", etc.Now our weekends consist of free or cheap activities such as:Volksmarching.  The cost is $3 per walk if you want to get credit and patches for your accomplishments.  This is a great group of people who meet every Saturday and walk 10k routes together.  We did this yesterday and had perfect weather, a wonderful group of people to walk with, and some strenuous hills to tackle, overall a great walk!Library.  This is a wonderful free option which entails hanging out at our local library, reading, then maybe borrowing books or DVDs on my way out.Working at home.  Sometimes we do a major cleaning.  Other times we do projects such as cleaning out the garage.  In the spring we will have yard work and gardening.  Actually staying at home is the best way to both get needed tasks done AND save money.  If you aren't out and about, you don't spend money.Movie marathon.  One lazy Sunday we were nearly out of money for the month and it was the middle of winter so there wasn't much to do around the house.  We ended up watching 12 HOURS of Lifetime movies (we're paying for cable so we might as well use it).  We called it our 'movie marathon weekend' and now when there isn't much to do we occasionally consider having a similar marathon weekend.Making money.  A couple of times during the summer we hold garage sales which take up the entire weekend and instead of spending money, we end up making money.  Other times I will get busy and post ads on Craigslist for items we want to sell which is easier to do if we will actually be home in order to meet the buyers.Baking and cooking.  Another occasional activity we do is have a cooking and baking weekend.  Generally we clean out the fridge and the cupboards then get busy processing food by baking cookies, banana bread, and regular bread for the upcoming week.  We cook up a pot of stew or chili, make egg rolls, tamales, or other items that take a long time to produce, and sometimes even invite friends or neighbors to enjoy the bounty.Low cost fitness activities.  Some weekend when we are looking for something to do, we will choose low cost fitness activities such as bike riding, hiking, swimming, racquetball (free at our military base gym), kicking a soccer ball around a local field, etc.  This is a great way to get outdoors, get some sunshine, and get some exercise all at the same time.Weekends need not be money drains on your budget.  You can do relaxing, out of the ordinary things that mix up your routine a bit but still don't cost a whole lot of money."},

Or can they still use plastic, as long as the money is coming from their bank account via a debit card transaction?The argument for the papery green kind of cash: when you run out of money you will have to stop spending, when you spend actual cash you can literally feel your money leaving your pocket, you won't risk overdrafts because you don't involve the banks at all, you surprise people who hardly ever see cash transactions any more, you are more aware of how much money you have when you can actually see it in your hands, and you will never be stuck without funds on those rare occasions when you go somewhere that only accepts cash.The argument for debit cards: you still retain the consumer protection that a debit card with a Visa or MasterCard logo on it provides, it is safer than carrying around a wad of cash, you are still technically using cash because you are debiting money from your account, and you can still \"swipe\" your purchases just like \"normal\" people do.Unless you have a serious issue with overspending if you use a debit card (ie: you overdraft your account because you can't stop spending with your debit card), I would suggest a combination of the two.  For a real eye-opener, you may want to use the first month of two when you switch to the cash-only lifestyle as a cash-only living experiment.  Simply cash your paycheck and divvy up the money into each of your budget categories.  Pay your bills in person with cash or buy money orders for bills that can only be mailed, then use the rest of your cash for all of your spending throughout the month.  This is generally a real shocker, I know it was for me.  With a  debit card, when you aren't looking at the cash you have, you have a sense of having money that will come from 'somewhere'.  So you spend accordingly.  This means you spend every last dime because you just know that more money will somehow magically appear in your account any day.  When you are using only greenbacks, there is no magically appearing money and when you have $50 in your gas envelope with two weeks left of the month, you do two things--you either drive less to conserve gas or you come up with a way to make some more money to add to the envelope.  This is how real economics works--you can only spend the money you have so you either need to spend less or earn more.  No magically appearing money, no \"maybe I can spend more than I have in my account and somehow get money into the account before it overdrafts\".So after cutting up all of my credit cards, paying off and closing all of my credit card accounts, and the eye-opening experience of spending only cash for a couple of month, I settled back into using a combination of cash and debit card.  Now I'm not afraid to use debit cards like I used to be since I am always aware of the balance of my accounts.  I have three separate bank accounts which all have debit cards.  One is for my emergency fund, one is for savings (such as what we use for traveling), and one is for regular expenses.  I still like using cash for most of our spending, and I use checks to pay bills by mail.  I use debit cards for larger purchases (mostly for the consumer protection),  and to purchase things online (like airline tickets or the rare Amazon purchase).  I think a combination of cash and debit cards works best but have known many people who seem to do really great using ONLY cash.  Which ever route you choose, the bottom line is that using either cash and/or debit cards will save you money AND keep you out of credit card hell."},
{"title": "100 Ways to Lower Your Expenses", "date": "Wednesday, February 3, 2010", "text": "Thinking back on the wild spending '90s, I seriously am appalled by how much money I frivolously threw away. If I could only get that money back, I would be out of debt and probably fairly well to do right now. If you are playing catch up, like me, here are 100 ways to hold on to more of your hard earned money.Color your hair at home. It's easier than you think.Find a lower cost place to get your hair cut. You may need to try a few places until you find a great hair cutter.Do your manicures and pedicures at home.Eat at home instead of restaurants.Brown bag your lunch and snacks every day.Skip the fancy coffee and make a pot at home.Switch to lower cost makeup (ie: Maybelline or Cover Girl) instead of the pricey department store variety.Use cloth diapers instead of disposables.Clean your own home instead of having a housekeeper.Do your own yard work instead of having a gardener.Pay off your debts and stay debt free.Refinance your home to a lower interest rate (and a shorter term if possible).Buy your clothes at thrift stores.Cancel garbage service if possible, and process your own garbage (compost, recycle, etc).Walk instead of driving, if it is too far, take the city bus or carpool.Choose the minimum cable package you can live with. Better yet, cut out TV all together.Cancel your home phone and use your cell.Lower your electric, gas, and water bill by reducing the amount of these products that you use.Use coupons as much as possible (but only for things you absolutely need).Haggle for items you are going to buy, even in big box and department stores.Try renting instead of buying if this works out better financially.Share larger purchases with friends and neighbors (everything from 50 pound bags of rice to lawnmowers).Use the library instead of bookstores and movie rental places.Trade like for like items with friends and relatives (everything from clothes to videos to babysitting).Rent out a room in your house.Always ask for discounts (ie: AAA, Costco, military, senior, etc).Take advantage of free stuff (ie: free smoke detectors from the fire department, free flu shots from the health department, free lectures at the library, free entrance nights at the museum).If you have a bad habit (smoking, drinking, etc), quit.Switch to cheaper hobbies (instead of golf, try walking; instead of skating, try swimming).Annually, review all of your bills and look for ways to reduce them (ie: drop the comprehensive coverage on your old car, compare cell plans and choose the most cost efficient one).Rent movies instead of going to first run shows. Better yet, wait until they are free on TV or cable.Hang your clothes to dry instead of using the dryer.Do your own repairs instead of hiring out the work.When grocery shopping, skip the over processed stuff and buy basic food (grains, meats, veggies, fruit).Switch to being a one car family. It can be done.Instead of funding the entire family reunion, make it a BYOB and potluck.Put the kids in public school instead of private school.Repair your clothes instead of tossing them (polish shoes, sew ripped seams, etc).Play poker for free online instead of going to the casino.Shop for--and stock up on--items when they are on sale (ie: school supplies in August, summer clothing in the fall).Make the kids earn their own spending money as soon as they are able to.Plan--and do as much work as possible for--your events such as parties, weddings, etc.Reduce the number of animals you have.Research, and sign up for) all of the benefits you are entitled to (military, unemployment, social service, etc).Combine your errands and only do them once a week.Shop monthly instead of weekly or every few days.Ditch the expensive designer perfume for fragranced lotion (a la Bath and Body works).Make your own baby food.Use a Diva Cup or similar device instead of tampons or pads.Buy party items (cards, wrap, bows, etc) at the Dollar Store.Shop garage sales instead of mall sales.Reduce the number of toys you buy for your kids and encourage the use of their imagination and creativity (big cardboard boxes and \"forts\" built out of blankets can be just as much fun as expensive plastic toys).Wash your own car instead of taking it to the car wash.Make your own treats (cookies, cake, popcorn) instead of buying these items.Use rags instead of paper towels.Make your own cleaning products (vinegar and baking soda based) instead of buying expensive cleaning products.Look for ways to get the things you want free (ie: be the bowling league secretary in exchange for free bowling fees, be an usher at the symphony so you can watch the show for free).Use Freecycle!Minimize the number of items you have/use (five good shirts instead of 20 so so shirts, two hair products instead of 10).Use natural air fresheners instead of chemical air fresheners (better yet, just open all of the windows each day).Look at all of your birth control options for both effectiveness AND cost effectiveness.Pay your bills online instead of using checks and stamps.Shop ethnic stores--prices on staples, spices, and vegies are often cheaper.Exercise and eat right every day to keep your medical costs down.Switch to cost saving vacations such as camping instead of jet-setting.Send gift cards for presents instead of bulky, expensive to mail items.Pay your bills annually (insurance, etc) if you can get a discount.Process your own food--freeze, can, dry, jelly--if you can get it in bulk at a good price.Switch to lower cost pet food instead of the premium stuff.Treat your own basic illnesses with old fashioned common sense (lots of rest, soup, Vitamin C, lots of liquids).If you see a better advertised deal for new customers such as for cable or cell phones, call and ask for the same deal even if you are a current customer (stress your long history with the company, etc).Stay home as much as possible. Leaving home often equates to spending money.Sell your house and buy something smaller (McMansions are so passe).If you really want to cut your housing expenses, look for options to trade your services (caring for the elderly, yard work, etc) for room and board or even just room.Cancel subscriptions (newspapers, magazines) and read these items online.Barter for services you would otherwise pay for (plumbing work for dental work, car work for landscaping).Never drive drunk, do drugs, or anything else that will put you at the mercy of the court system. If this has already happened, pay off your court fees/fines ASAP, using community service if possible.Skip the gym membership and walk around your neighborhood/mall/park.Skip the high priced counselor (if possible) and join support groups (AA, Compassionate Friends, etc).Skip the beverages and drink water, both at home and in restaurants.Buy products that fit your needs, not the latest styles (ie: if you only need a music player and not all the bells and whistles, buy a MP3 player instead of an iTouch).Heat only the room(s) you are using. Turn the house heat on 55 when you are in your bedroom and use a small space heater to heat only your bedroom.Participate in activities at discounted times (ie: our skating rinks have $1 night and 'cheap skate' nights, if you must go to a movie go during the matinee instead of paying full price).Instead of expensive gifts, give services and experiences. Take your nephew skating, give free babysitting certificates to new parents, etc.Dress classically with a bit of flair instead of following every single trend (you'll look better in pictures 20 years from now too!).Look for free education opportunities: scholarships, grants, free community classes, colleges that offer free tuition, etc.Instead of organized tours when you go on vacation, strike out on your own by taking public transit, eating in hole-in-the-wall restaurants, and asking the locals about things to do.Have one stay at home parent to save on childcare, transportation, work-related expenses, etc.Choose where you live based on how much money you can save (near to work reduces the commute cost, in an area with good schools reduced the need for private schools, in a safe area will allow you to walk/exercise outside instead of worrying about your safety, in a safe neighborhood means you may not need bars on your windows and a security system).Decorate your home with thrift stores finds, home made items (your own artwork), and stuff on sale from Ross or TJ Maxx or Big Lots.Skip things that may have a negative effect on your body (tattoos, tanning beds, junk food, etc).Reduce stress which can induce illness. Do some stretches, yoga, deep breathing, journaling, etc.Set boundaries with people if necessary (boyfriends that are perpetually sponging off of you, siblings that take advantage of you AND take you money, friends that need everything from a place to stay to bail money, etc).Skip the enhancements: fake boobs, fake hair, fake tan, botox, face lifts, a new nose when your old nose is fine, fake nails...Re-do instead of buying new: reupholster your couch, paint a dresser to match the new decor instead of buying a new one, tune up your old bike instead of getting a new one, etc.Drop the drama--divorce, affairs, hiding financial problems, having a bunch of kids with random women--all cause you to lose money, not to mention create a massive amount of stress.Buy store brands when possible (they are often cheaper and taste the same--sometimes even better--than name brand items).Pay cash for your cars, NEVER get on a payment plan. If you can only afford a $1000 car then you can only afford a $1,000 car. You can upgrade when you save more money.Tax shelter you savings by investing in a Roth IRA, 403b, 401k, etc.Be happy, be a minimalist."},
{"title": "20 Ways to Save Cash When Traveling", "date": "Sunday, January 31, 2010", "text": "For the past week the hubby and I have been bouncing around the country, visiting family and reaching some travel goals. We are convinced that we are some of the cheapest travelers you will meet. Here's some easy ways to save money when traveling:We only travel with one carry on bag each. For the cost of bringing a checked bag each way with us ($40 to $50 per person), we could use the extra cash to buy any other item we need at our destination.Our travel dates are always flexible. Having to travel on specific dates usually locks you into higher fares. I usually check out http://www.orbitz.com/ via their flexible date search and choose a range of days to travel, thus coming up with the lowest fares.We use public transportation at our destination. There may be a rare occasion when we need to rent a car (ie: visiting family that lives in the boonies), but for most of our travel, we are in cities or suburbs that have pretty good public transportation options (ie: the $5 24-hour fare card in Las Vegas that takes you all over the strip, and the entire city for that matter or the daily Metro pass in Washington DC).We take our own food. Staying in hotels, we never use the mini bar or the snack basket ($5 for a small tube of Oreos?!?). Instead, we head out from the hotel to a grocery store and buy bottled water and snacks to take back with us to the hotel.When we are traveling, we generally eat light snacks in the room for breakfast (or better yet, many of the mid-range hotels we stay at offer a free breakfast), eat lunch out at a different restaurant every day, then dinner usually consists of picking up picnic items at the local grocery store or Super WalMart. This way we get to try wonderful restaurants at discounted lunch prices and still have plenty of food to keep us satisfied throughout the day.One of our favorite ways to travel is by cruise ship. We find discounted cruises (usually at the beginning or end of the season or during travel \"dead times\" such as the second week of December) and enjoy a week or more of cruising at less than $50 per person per day. The best part about cruises is that EVERYTHING is included--food, cabin, entertainment, recreation, etc. When we go on cruises, or travel anywhere for that matter, we don't sign up for guided tours. Our usual M.O. is to walk around a city to see what's happening then take public transportation or hire a car to take us to off the beaten track places if there is something we really don't want to miss.Using the web is an excellent way to find discounted attractions in your destination city. We have attended plays, symphonies, lectures, garden tours, and many other events simply because we checked out the local events calendar for a particular city and found free and low cost entertainment options.We do splurge on once-in-a-lifetime activities. If you are only going to have an opportunity once in your lifetime to do something, better to spend some extra cash than have regrets later.We use debit cards instead of credit cards when traveling. Actually we don't use credit cards period so that leaves only cash and debit cards as a form of payment. We carry some cash with us but not a huge amount so if it were to get stolen, it wouldn't be the end of our vacation. We have debit cards from three different banks with plenty of cash in each account. We use one for hotel and car rental because we know these places will place a significant hold on the cash in the account. We use another for cash withdrawals because it has a low fee for this, and we use the third card for expenses. The secret is to keep plenty of money in these accounts AND be sure to tell your card issuer when you are going out of town so a fraud hold doesn't get placed on the card for suspicious activity.We are good guests. Actually we are very low maintenance guests. One way we travel cheap is to stay with friends and family if possible when we travel. We try to get to their places under our own steam so as not to inconvenience them, usually cook and clean while we are there, even offering to do simple home fix up projects if we have the time, clean up after ourselves, and generally be good guests so that we will be invited back.We like mid-range hotels. Many times we have used Hotwire to find super discounted hotels in our destination cities. We have been pleasantly surprised on a couple of occasions (a suite at the Palms and a luscious room at the Pan Pacific in Vancouver BC) and unpleasantly appalled (hotels to remain nameless) a couple of times. Most of the time we have been satisfied with the surprise hotel rooms that we stay in. We tend to choose mid-range hotels when possible as they usually offer a clean room and a wealth of amenities as opposed to five star hotels which charge you for literally everything (parking, breakfast, internet, using the pool, etc). On the flip side, I simply refuse to stay in a crappy hotel even if it is cheaper--life is too short to be miserable.We seek out free wi-fi. Hopefully our hotel will provide this free amenity, if not, however, we come prepared with our own list of places that offer free internet, previously researched online before we left home. Note that purchasing internet time on a cruise ship is a huge expense for what equates to a dial-up speed network. Better to find a (much) cheaper internet cafe when you get into port.Getting to the airport can be a challenge. We live nearly two hours from our closest major airport so we have devised a few options depending on our flight times. First, we absolutely hate to impose on family or friends to cart us to and from the airport; we'll do this in an emergency but otherwise try to use other means. One option is to keep the car at home then ride public transportation to the airport which is always a good option, if the flight is not too early or too late; note this is very easy if you only carry one bag. We also know of a very cheap airport parking lot which is a little ways from the airport but has excellent shuttle service which we use for shorter duration trips. For really long trips, we park our car a a friend's house who lives near the airport and will keep an eye on our car for us while we are gone (ie: he starts it once a week to keep the battery charged, etc).We don't buy souvenirs when we travel. Most of it just gathers dust when we get back anyway. If there is something useful I can find, such as duty-free alcohol which we give as gifts, beautiful blankets or other handiwork that has an actual use, or unique gifts that I find for specific people who I know will like them, we will buy them (haggling all the way of course). Otherwise we just take pictures and are happy to save memories that way.The hubby and I tend to travel with coordinating stuff. This means everything from clothes (we travel with jeans, t shirts, fleece jackets, etc) to electronic equipment (laptops, cell phones, iPods) to other travel items are basically the same. This way, if one of us loses our cell phone charger, the other's charger will work. We carry one digital camera charger and multiples of the same type of memory cards because we both have the same kind of digital camera.We haggle. A lot. We ask for discounts on everything. Meals, event/activity entrance fees, hotels on occasion...basically if we are going to be paying, we are going to be asking for a discount based on anything we can think of (ie: a senior discount for hubby, a military discount for both of us, a Costco discount, a AAA discount, or if all else fails, a \"we only have this much money to our names\" discount).We find unique vacation experiences in the oddest places. My hobby is visiting cemeteries, the older the better. This is a free activity, by the way. One of my most memorable experiences was visiting a friend who had to visit a relative in a hospital when we were in a third world country. I've never been to a third-world hospital before so I was happy to tag along. It was an interesting and enlightening experience.We try to give back when we travel. Whether it is helping a relative fix a handrail or bringing donated books or medical supplies to third world countries, being useful at your destination, even though you are technically \"on vacation\" is a wonderful way to help others, spread good will, and make unique vacation memories. Surprisingly, this often rewards us with many unexpected perks--a great meal at a restaurant compliments of the relative we helped, unique handcrafted items from a tribe in the South Pacific that couldn't even be found in museums in gratitude for medical supplies we delivered to them, etc.We travel as often as possible. This may not be a money-saving tip but for us, traveling is worth its weight in good memories, if not gold. Other people may spend their disposable income on golf, some on shopping for brand names shoes and purses, but for us, the expense of traveling is well worth it when compared to what we receive from our travel experiences."},
{"title": "How My Giant 'To Do' List Saves Me Money", "date": "Wednesday, January 27, 2010", "text": "I am almost always busy. I run a non-profit, I own a business, I volunteer a lot, and I am active in all kinds of community events. Plus I like to travel and this year I have a little list of 400 goals to complete in 400 days. Wow...I am busy. The way that I keep on track (and keep my sanity) it to have a huge daily \"to do\" list. I recently noted that this list also saves me a lot of money. Here's how:I make up my list for the next day before I go to bed the night before (if I tried to keep all of these things in my head I would never get to sleep and the fatigue/stress would certainly cause future health problems thus costing me money).I arrange my day in logical order. Nearly every day I end up traveling from one end of the region to the other. If I arrange my day in logical order I save money on gas. I figure out the route I will take, trying not to recross my steps, while dropping off or picking up things along the way so no special trips are needed. With planning, I can often carpool to many meetings (again saving gas money) with others who I know are going to the same place. On less busy days when I have more time, I often opt for public transportation which saves money as well.When my day is laid out on paper, I can figure out how/when/where to eat for the day. Generally I start off my day with a good breakfast at home but I may be away from home for lunch and dinner. If I see that this will be the case by looking at my schedule, I bring food from home so I am not caught out without a meal which would mean an expensive stop at a restaurant(s).Having a clear schedule allows me to save time and money on errands. Instead of spending money for a stamp, I can pay many bills on my way to and from where I am going (ie: the cable company is next to the post office, the Target bill can be paid when I meet my carpool in the Target parking lot). Coupons for groceries are attached to the to do list with a paperclip so that if I happen to pass by a particular store, I have my coupons with me and then no special trips to the store are needed, thus saving gas.Bill payment due dates are included on my calendar and are put on the to do list as they come up. This way I am never late on a payment and don't incur late fees.Follow up phone calls and messages are listed on the to do list as well. While this may or may not save me money, there have been a few times where a message was for work from a new client. If I would have let these calls slide, I would have missed out on earning money.Birthdays are put on the to do list. This way, I send a simple (inexpensive) acknowledgement of the person's birthday or special occasion instead of the more expensive \"sorry I forgot your birthday\" gifts that I can sometimes feel guilted into giving.If my list is too overwhelming, I can call in reinforcements (the hubby). By letting the hubby know in the morning that I need him to cook dinner, we save money which we would otherwise spend on eating out because we were both too tired or too disorganized to cook. If the yard is getting overgrown, I can either make time in my schedule on a slow day or ask the hubby to do it so I don't have to hire a yard service.The bottom line is that being organized can save you money. I know people (and I've been the person) who are so disorganized that they end up spending a whole lot of money for things that with a little planning would have not cost them a penny."},

After paying $90 for a diagnosis, we found out that it will cost around $700 to fix the ignition control board and another part. Bummer.Our one car needs some work. It has a leak around the thermostat that is getting worse. We have been putting off getting it fixed but it looks like this problem will soon move to the top of our \"fix it\" list. In addition, the tail light went out and changing the bulb isn't fixing the problem so it looks like the shop needs to take a look at that as well before we get pulled over for having a light out. Ouch.Our house's main line drain is not working. It backed up and made a mess and two plumbers later they are still working on it (for some reason I think we picked the two worst plumbers in the phone book). I'll quit whining now.

{"title": "How to Put an Extra $1000 in Your Pocket in One Week", "date": "Thursday, January 7, 2010", "text": "Whether you need to bulk up (or start) an emergency fund, your furnace finally decided to go toes up, or you just want to comfort of having an extra $1000 in cash in your pocket, here's how to gather up an extra $1000 in only one week:Have a garage sale.  Everyone has extra stuff laying around.  Put an ad on Craigslist, hand paint some signs to hang around the neighborhood, and hold a one or two day sale.  Net: $100.Sell something on eBay.  You can sell higher value, easily shippable items on eBay and have the product sold, paid for, and shipped during the course of a three-day auction.  Items that seem to sell particularly well: cell phones and other small electronics, name brand purses, name brand shoes, new things.  Net: $100.Sell something on Craigslist.  On Craigslist you can sell bigger, bulkier items that would be too costly to ship if you sold them through eBay.  This is also a great way to sell items and get a better price than selling them at a garage sale.  Simply put a free ad on Craigslist for your unused or out grown bicycles, the punching bag that started out as a good idea but is seldom used, the basketball hoop that the kids left behind when they moved out, the treadmill you used a couple of times, or anything else that you don't need.  Net: $100.Sell your gold to a reputable local dealer.  Look through your jewelry box and find broken gold chains/rings/bracelets or gold items that you no longer wear and sell them to a local gold dealer (I don't recommend sending your gold to places that advertise on late night TV, local dealers tend to pay more).  Net: $100.Pocket $100 out of your weekly shopping money and force the family to eat the food that you already have at home.  You may find food that you haven't seen in ages at the bottom of your freezer or in the back of your cabinets.  This is an excellent way to both save money and clean out your cupboards/freezer!  Net: $100.Work overtime or an extra shift.  Depending on your job, you may be able to work an extra shift or pick up some overtime and pocket the extra cash.  If this is not possible, check out the Craigslist ads for 'gigs' which provide one-time job opportunities.  Net: $100.Advertise a service on Craigslist.  There has to be something you can do for one day that can net you some extra cash with a cleverly worded ad and some good before and after pictures.

{"title": "Eating Out vs Eating In", "date": "Tuesday, January 5, 2010", "text": "Last Saturday the hubby and I enjoyed a dinner out courtesy of a belated Christmas gift from a relative.  We went to a chain steak place and I was floored for a number of reasons.  Mostly because the dinner for two--shared appetizer, one soda for hubby, two basic steak dinners, and two desserts plus tip--cost $70 (!).  Further, the place was packed--there was nearly an hour wait for a table, the customers were mainly families with kids and they didn't look wealthy, they looked fairly average.  My first thought was how do these people AFFORD such dinners?  It didn't look like these were celebratory dinners like for a birthday or anniversary, it looked like people were just eating a regular dinner out.I think I pointed out in an earlier post that we don't eat out very often.  When we do eat out, usually when we are out of town, we always tend to choose ethnic, hole-in-the-wall restaurants that give you a big serving of yummy food for really reasonable prices.  Eating out this weekend only reinforced the reasons we usually choose to eat in:I don't wait in line to eat.  Mostly because I don't like crowds and don't think I will get a great meal if my meal order is one of hundreds.  In fact our order took over an hour to get and was marginally cold when it arrived at our table.I don't like chain restaurants.  Chain restaurants are so...chain-like.  Everything is the same.  There is no room for a chef's creativity, no way to even talk to the cooks, and no special \"the chef wants you to try this\" that often happens in small, out of the way, family run restaurants.I don't like paying $70 for a meal for two people!  Unless it is a one time \"restaurant experience\" like going to the Melting Pot or the Space Needle or the Herb Farm, spending a ton of money on a meal you can make at home for, in this case, maybe $15 total, is ludicrous.  If this was my money I was spending I would have been able to buy groceries that would last us nearly two weeks.I don't like the \"yuppie restaurant experience.\"  Cute young waitresses that answer \"I don't know\" and don't bother to find out the answers to your questions.  Food that is very generic and not at all amazing (I much prefer a sublime container of dim sum at our favorite Chinese restaurant in Seattle which costs about $3).  Food that is way over priced (one appetizer of two smallish crab cakes for $10.95!).  More or less mandatory tip even though the service wasn't that great.  The loud, rowdy-ish atmosphere.Overall it was a nice gesture on the part of our relative and the experience wasn't a total wash.  The steak leftovers made a wonderful fried rice the next day, we both agreed that the experience was a good one-time event but nothing we want to repeat in the near future, and we are secure in the fact that our choice to limit eating out is both a boon to our finances and our health."},
{"title": "10 Financial Disasters I Learned to Avoid from Judge Judy", "date": "Sunday, January 3, 2010", "text": "I like Judge Judy. If there is one TV show I try to catch each day, besides Dave Ramsey which comes on right afterwards, it is Judge Judy. Both Judy and Dave have a refreshing, no BS, take on things which is highly appreciated (and necessary!) in a world that seems to reward stupidity and bad decisions. If you watch for a while, you will notice that Judge Judy seems to handle the same cases over and over, only the people change, and most cases revolve around money. Here's 10 ways to keep you out of financial trouble (and off of the Judge Judy show):Don't sign up for a cell phone contract for anyone (ie: boyfriend, girlfriend, roommate, family member, etc). Once you sign your name to a contract, you are responsible for that contract and with cell phones, that usually means you are stuck paying for two years unless you pay the early termination fee. The problem with getting a cell phone for others is that they tend to use way more minutes than they are allotted, not pay their monthly share like they promised to, lose their job so they have no money, etc. Which means you are stuck holding the proverbial bag. If you want to help someone out with a cell phone, get them a cheap, pre-paid phone to get them started then they can pay for their future minutes.Don't get into a lease with anyone. It is better to get on your own lease, for your own place, even if it is the size of a closet, rather that expecting your current boyfriend/best friend/Craigslist buddy to pay their half of the lease payment for a year or more. Like the above, they will lose their job, decide they hate you, find a better room mate, etc. and you will be stuck for the entire cost of the lease.Don't loan money to anyone. Again, like the above, people tend to lend money to friends, family members, or even near strangers and wonder why they never get paid back. NEVER loan money to anyone. If you have money and you want to help someone, give them the money as a gift without expecting to be paid back.Don't sell something (like a car) to anyone (like friends, family, or strangers) on credit. You aren't a loan agency, you aren't the repo man, and you aren't a business that can write off a bad debt. Never sell something to anyone on credit. Like the above, they will lose their job, figure out they can't afford to pay you, or become dissatisfied with the car, and you will be left with nothing. If you want to sell a car or other item, make sure the transaction is a cash-only deal with all sales final.Don't pay someone's bail/pay someone's fines/pay someone's child support and expect to be paid back. If people are in such a lousy position that they can't even #1 stay out of trouble, and/or #2 take care of their basic responsibilities, don't be surprised if you never see your money again.Don't fight over a guy/girl. Many cases come about because people are jealous and end up fighting over a loser with someone else. A girl is mad at her \"boyfriend\" because she sees he is hanging out at another girls house so she keys one or both of their cars. A guy is mad at another guy because he sees his girl out with the other guy so he does the guy thing and beats up the other guy. Either way you could end up arrested, with a record, and paying court costs/fines/restitution. If your significant (or insignificant) other doesn't want to be with you why would you want to be with them??Do control your kids. There's usually a few cases each week in which someone didn't control their kid and said kid caused someone else a financial loss--drove a friend's parent's car when they were drunk and wrecked it, rode their bicycle into the side of a parked car and scratched it, beat up a neighbor kid and caused damage. Then you end up on TV making a weak explanation for your kid's bad behavior, you lose, and end up paying for damages.Do get every contract in writing. Even with your best friend or close family member, if you decide not to heed the warnings above and sell something to/buy something from/get into a contract with said friend or family member, get EVERYTHING in writing. Verbal contracts are not worth much and assuming things doesn't even fly in court.Do watch out for cons. Some people are just con artists. They offer something that is too good to be true, which usually includes the exchange of money, and then you end up with the short end of the stick. Don't expect something for nothing and definitely do your research before you part with your money.Do rectify problems quickly and efficiently. Some people drag out their problems for years. Some people keep hoping to get paid forever. Some people keep throwing good money after bad like when a girlfriend/boyfriend borrows money, doesn't pay it back, then they loan them MORE money. Judy Judy hates it when a person allows another person to get away with bad behavior, then goes right back and allows that bad behavior to continue.The bottom line is that you need to keep your money to yourself and allow others to sort out their own financial problems. Otherwise, I might just see you on Judy Judy!"},
{"title": "Going Cash Only? Other People Are Too", "date": "Saturday, January 2, 2010", "text": "I was happy to wake up to a new year and see these great articles about living cash only (apparently I am not the only weird person around here):Family Saves With Cash. Although this is an older article, it just showed up on Consumerist today. I read the article and knew exactly what they were talking about because the same things have happened to me. Going into the grocery store with a set amount of money means you don't throw extras into your basket. Yes getting gas with cash is a pain but you also get a little more exercise because you need to walk into the store to pay. And no, I don't go to the mall randomly any more, I will just want to shop and since I don't have credit cards and don't want to spend my cash that is budgeted for other things, I simply skip the mall all together.In Debt? Go Cash Only. I have heard this excuse many times.,,\"we only use our credit cards for emergencies and always pay them off each month.\" But what happens if you lose your job, or you use your card to buy something you don't really need and then for some reason can't pay off the entire balance? No credit cards is the best way to go. If you have an emergency you should (duh) have an emergency fund to draw from. This is why Dave Ramsey says to get your starter emergency fund together then destroy your credit cards so that you will have some cash available if you have an emergency which is much better--for any emergency--then putting yourself into credit card debt.Living on a Cash Only Diet. This article shows you that there are a number of reasons to go cash only and a number of challenges that come along with this change. The bottom line is that it can be done and lots of people are doing it.Cash Only Medical Care. Not only is the public getting in on the cash-only craze, but so, apparently, are doctors."},
{"title": "New Year's Resolutions (Or How Am I Going to Make My 400 Goals This Year?)", "date": "Thursday, December 31, 2009", "text": "The answer is...I have no idea. On Thanksgiving I was a bit bored then I calculated that there were approximately 400 days between the day after Thanksgiving and the end of 2010 then I wrote out 400 (!) goals I wanted to accomplish by December 31, 2010. So now I have approximately 370 things still left to complete, many of which take money, and I have no idea how I will accomplish this very huge project.This is an interesting project in many ways. First, its sheer size. I need to accomplish approximately one goal per day (or seven per week or 30 per month) to complete the list in the allotted time. Second, while these aren't exactly resolutions--I don't say \"get healthy\" for example--they are mostly one time tasks that will lead me in the direction of my goals like having a different physical activity to complete about every four days which (I hope) will allow me to end up healthier. Finally, I need to accomplish these goals with cash flow, definitely not with credit. I think if I were to add up the cost of completing each goal I would throw in the towel right now but surprisingly the first almost 30 goals have been easily achievable and really low cost--some things on the list I received for gifts, some trips will be paid for by work, some items I have found on really good sales. I think it is true what they say--once you have a definite direction the universe opens up and makes way for you. We'll see what the final outcome is. If you want to follow along on this adventure, or make a list of your own and would like me to link it to my 400 Goals blog, please add a comment below!"},
{"title": "My Cash Only Food Plan", "date": "Wednesday, December 30, 2009", "text": "When you pay cash for everything, you really feel your hard earned money leaving your possession. Knowing that I have much better things to spend my money on (like paying down debt), I hate the feeling of parting with money for frivolous and unnecessary things. While food is quite necessary, I see many ways that people can take this line item in their budget and blow it up into a whole bunch of frivolous spending. Here is our basic food plan which allows us (the hubby and I) to spend less than $200 per month on food for two people:We grocery shop once a week with a list of absolute necessities. These are the things we absolutely have to have (like eggs if we are running low) but it doesn't include things we would \"like to have\" like steak or caviar.We shop loss leaders religiously. Sometimes we do have steak, and lots of it, if it is bargain-basement priced. Some weeks the highly discounted items are cheese and milk, other weeks chicken is on sale and we end up eating a lot of chicken for the next couple of weeks. Our meals revolve around the sale items in each week's ads. Note that these items need to be relatively healthy items and not sale-priced junk food.Junk food is made at home. Things for dessert are so easy to make--cookies, cake, pie--that these and many other items are made at home from scratch instead of being purchased already made.We make lots of things at home out of raw ingredients. Yogurt is so simple to make and so cheap to make when you make it at home. We also make soups, chili, granola, fried rice, pizza, spaghetti, hamburgers--basically anything that is considered 'processed food' in the store can be made much cheaper, and actually healthier, at home.The bakery outlet store has amazing prices so we do shop there weekly. Different outlets have different prices but there is one outlet with day old goods in our city that has amazingly low prices like bread for 50 cents a loaf.We don't eat out. Although we love trying new restaurants when we travel and make this expense part of our travel budget, when we are not traveling we almost always eat at home.If we must eat out, like after a long day out that we didn't plan for, we will either split a $5 Subway or hit the $1 menu at Wendy's for a snack to tide us over.If we will be out most of the day (ie: at work or at events) we bring our lunch from home. Each night's meal usually includes enough leftovers for the next day's lunch which, depending on our schedule, we either eat at home or pack up and take with us.Beverages come from home to. I finally kicked my daily Starbucks addiction and now coffee, tea, and even water are brought from home in a cute Starbucks bottle.We only shop Costco a couple of times a year (on a card provided free of charge by my employer, otherwise we wouldn't purchase enough to justify the expense of the membership). Just wandering through Costco makes me want to shop but we limit our purchase here to a couple of times of year when we stock up on grains that we use year-round. 200 pounds of rice, ten boxes of oatmeal, a 25 pound sack of pinto beans...basically if the item has a good shelf life, we eat it regularly, and we can purchase it in bulk for less than we could buy it for at the regular grocery store, we buy it at Costco.We buy and eat produce in season. Produce in season is usually also a loss leader at our local grocery stores so instead of eating watermelon in the middle of winter, we eat apples which are much cheaper. Asparagus are quite tasty, and less expensive, in the spring, grapes are eaten mostly in the spring and fall, and although we use a lot of tomatoes year round, we try to eat more of them in the summer when they are in season and use fewer tomato recipes in the winter when they are out of season and cost more.Saving money on food can be very rewarding both financially and health-wise. The typical American family eats out maybe a half dozen times a week which can really blow your budget (and your waistline!). By making simple meals at home based on in-season, loss leader groceries, you can really stretch your food budget thereby allowing you to save more of your hard-earned money."},
{"title": "A No Spend Week", "date": "Tuesday, December 29, 2009", "text": "Last Saturday I wrapped up a no spend week. I like to do this occasionally as it seems to reorient my thinking about spending, or rather, mindless spending. The idea is to pick a week and don't spend a single penny for that entire week. For many people this is pretty difficult as we tend to spend money randomly throughout the week and not even think about it--candy from the vending machine at work, a latte on the way to the office, lunch out, handing money to the kids as they request it, etc.I started my no spend week on the Sunday before Christmas. Sunday was fine as I stayed home all day thus I didn't go anywhere that required an outlay of cash. Monday, the start of the holiday week was also a stay at home day as I didn't have to go to work so I basically stayed home and got caught up on work. Tuesday I stayed home by choice--the hubby asked if I wanted to go with him and walk around the mall while he got the oil changed in his car. I declined because the only thing that going to the mall was going to do was make me spend money. Wednesday was a little trickier. I had a couple of work related meetings to attend. At the first meeting I had to make a conscious effort to NOT go to Starbucks as this is a habit when I go to this particular meeting. Then I went to a second meeting. After this meeting I was waiting for the city bus to get back home but it was cold outside so I wandered into a store in a strip mall mainly to keep warm. They had sales! I couldn't buy anything! Any other day I would have bought a snack to eat while I was waiting (it had been a long day and I didn't have lunch) and if there were good sales, I probably would have bought at least one thing, but I resisted the temptation to spend and waited until I got home to eat. At the bus transfer center there were a couple of kids asking their mom for change for the candy machine; ordinarily I would have given them a couple of quarters but, again, I had to resist because it was a no spend week. Thursday was Christmas eve. All of my Christmas shopping was done so I didn't NEED anything but it is a habit to check out the sales on Christmas eve day just to see if there is any good day-before-Christmas sales. Again, I stayed home just to avoid the temptation to spend money. Friday was Christmas so it was basically a bonus--nothing was open so I actually couldn't spend money. Saturday was the most difficult. I almost always go shopping the day after Christmas and pick up heavily discounted Christmas wrap and Christmas decorations to use next year. I went for a walk instead and didn't go anywhere near the stores just so I wouldn't spend money.So that's it. A week in which I didn't spend even a penny. It does take a bit of thinking ahead if you are going to do a no spend week. Do you have enough gas to last the week? Do you have enough food? Do the kids have their week's worth of lunch money ahead of time? But the way a no spend week changes your thinking is well worth the effort. This week I am much more aware every time I pull out my cash to buy something. Do I really need it? Do I want to let go of my heard-earned money? Can I wait until next week to buy this item (something I though a few times during my no spend week)? If you want to save money, or just make yourself way more aware of how you spend your money, try a no spend week challenge yourself!"},
{"title": "A Cash Only Christmas", "date": "Monday, December 28, 2009", "text": "I was kind of amused by some stories on the news today about people's \"Christmas credit hang overs.\" My simple answer is that if you don't have credit cards, you won't go into credit debt to buy Christmas presents. Then the first weeks of January, you can actually look forward to a happy new year instead of getting that sick feeling in the pit of your stomach as soon as the credit card bills start rolling in.If you want to be able to enjoy Christmas next year instead of getting onto the nauseating \"buy gifts you can't afford, celebrate Christmas only half-heartedly because the other half of you is feeling sick over the amount you put on your credit cards, wake up in January and wonder how the heck you are going to be able to make your minimum payments\" roller coaster, here's some simple steps:Beginning with your January budget, divide the amount you want to spend on Christmas next year by 12. Put that amount of money (1/12 of the total) into your budget under a Christmas category.  When your paycheck comes in, put that money in an envelope marked \"Christmas gifts\". Put the envelope away but remember that you can use all money that ends up in this envelope throughout the year to buy Christmas gifts. Each month, as you find things on sale that may make a good Christmas gift for someone on your list (you do have a list don't you?), pick up the item, pay for it out of your Christmas gift envelope, then safely store the gift until next Christmas.This system works out well for quite a few reasons. First, you are putting aside actual cash for Christmas instead of waiting until the end of the year then charging everything on your credit cards. Second, it sets a budget for Christmas spending--no money, no buying presents. Third, it gives you the opportunity to shop throughout the year so you can pick up some really good sale items as they come available, instead of trying to cram all of your shopping into a couple of weeks before Christmas which often forces you to pay top dollar. And finally, by shopping throughout the year, you can roll into December in relative peace and serenity--no battling mall crowds in order to buy dozens of gifts--they are already waiting for Christmas in your closet!"},
{"title": "10 Dumb Ways to Separate Yourself from Your Cash", "date": "Sunday, November 22, 2009", "text": "Obviously there are lots and lots of ways to separate you from your hard-earned cash but here are the most brain-dead ways to practically give your money away to a bad cause:Rent to own places.  Ayayay.  Every time I see a rent to own place's delivery truck go by I want to follow it to some schmucks house and lecture them on topics financial.  If you can't pay cash for something, wait until you save up the money so that you can pay cash, in full, for the item.  These places are especially horrible because they charge four or five times the going rate for their wares (TVs, sofas, etc) and people actually PAY it.  Dumb.Payday lenders.  Another horrible business that takes advantage of people who can't do math.  What part of 400% interest don't they understand?  Taking out a payday loan will suck you into a never ending cycle of get loan, pay back loan out of next check, run out of money, take out another loan.  Rinse and repeat.Credit cards.  See previous post about credit cards.  High interest rates, universal default clause, over limit fees, annual fees, late fees....need I say more?Leasing anything.  Especially cars.  People take out leases because it is a lower monthly payment way to get a car they can't afford.  So you end up at the end of a five or six year lease and still owe half the cost of the car.  Bad idea.Loaning money to friends and family.  Never, never, never do this.  If you can't afford to give the money to the person as a present, don't loan it because you probably won't see your money or your relationship again.Co-signing for anything.  Again, never, never, never do this.  The person needs a co-signer because their credit is bad.  Their credit is bad because they don't pay back their debts.  If you co-sign for their debts, they won't pay and you will end up with the bill.Doing illegal stuff.  Driving without a license, having expired car tags, getting a DUI...if you do something that is against the law, expect to get caught and pay through the nose for it.Taking on more debt than you can afford.  People who end up with house payments that cost 50% of their monthly income, car loans that are nearly four figures, and other debts that are way out of line with their income will end up bankrupt AND without the item they paid so much for.Taking part in any kind of get rich quick scheme.  If it was so easy to get rich quick do you think the people who are offering the information/class/item would be doing the work to get you involved?  Wouldn't they be off enjoying their money some where?  If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.Trying to impress others.  In order to impress others we usually buy stuff they (and we) can't afford to look better/richer/more impressive.  This is a quick way to financial ruin.  Better to impress people with your wisdom than stuff you can't afford.OK.  I'm off my soapbox for today.  Remember...cash rocks!"},
{"title": "The Downsizing Plan", "date": "Tuesday, November 17, 2009", "text": "After the drama of last week, I decided to get super serious about getting out of debt and truly stabilizing our financial life.  Although we are getting by fine now--income is good, bills are paid on time each month, etc--it really hit home that one major change such as a job loss or a long term illness could spell disaster for our financial situation (and our lives in general).  So I called a friend who is a realtor and ran some ideas by her.I have been kind of in downsizing mode since I got rid of my car.  Your average American has an idea of the things they absolutely need to have for a nice life: a big house in a nice neighborhood, a nice car, a good income, et al.  I, on the other hand, having hit my \"radical years\" decades past the teenage years when you are supposed to question everything, have started wondering if what \"everyone\" thinks you need to have  for a nice life really is true.  All of these people who think that you need a huge house, an expensive car, and a good job, seem completely miserable what with their huge house payments, excessive car payments, and jobs that could be here today and gone tomorrow.So here is my downsizing plan:Sell our house which is really way too big for just two people and has a correspondingly big house payment.Find a small, 1000 square foot house that I really love and buy it, hopefully with a huge down payment out of what we make from the sale of our house.Have the mother of all garage sales to get rid of like half of our stuff which won't fit into the smaller house.Because our new house payment will be maybe half of what we are currently paying, use the extra money that we have been paying each month on our current house to pay down our debt as quickly as possible.Live totally debt free and travel the world.Seems like a simple plan.  Over the last few days we have looked at a couple of small, cute houses and had our realtor check out our house to see if it would bring in what we think it will (and she said the sales price could be just what we need for that significant down payment).The next step will be to make an offer on the house that we like contingent on the sale of our current home, get financing arranged, plant a St Joseph in our yard for a quick sale (it works!), followed by a garage sale then moving day.  Once all of the dust settles, we will be in a smaller house that is more suitable to our needs, we will have much smaller house payments, we will be able to pay all of our debts in full within a year, hubby will be able to fully retire by next year, and then we will be off traveling the world as much as possible!"},
{"title": "Things Can Change.  FAST", "date": "Friday, November 13, 2009", "text": "So I was going along with life yesterday and all was well with the world. Then we had a Board meeting and life changed pretty quickly. First there was the coup by a few Board members which completely changed the make up, and leadership of the Board of Directors for the company I work for. Then everyone in the office went into panic mode. Nothing has actually changed yet but, politically, the group was very well aligned with the former Chairman and Board. They basically let everyone have free reign as long as the work got done. Now the \"axis of evil\" group is in power.I'm guessing this is the kind of thing that happened in Regency England when Kings ruled, people curried favor with the King, and then on a nasty day, the King would be dethroned, or worse, and all of his supporters would find themselves out on their collective asses. Not good. I am so not political (or politically correct, but that's another post). I also don't play chess but I'm sure that chess skills would come in handy at moments like these as people maneuver two or three steps ahead of each other while the rest of us sit around and wonder what the the Hell happened.Which brings us to the current situation. Nothing has happened as yet and there is some legal rumbling going on. We don't know how this situation will play out. Either the axis of evil group will be removed or they will remain in power. If they remain in power, things could get dicey. This particular group has a way of railroading people they don't like out of jobs. And they don't like the majority of us. So here are my concerns/comments in no particular order:I would like to be out of debt before being dropped from a nicely lucrative job. Although I am working on the debt free thing, I figure it will take at least another year to complete this task.I am in better shape than others. One lady who is fairly high up in the organization may very well be one of the first on the chopping block. And she spends like a maniac. I don't think she learned anything from the recession, probably because she had this cushy job and could continue spending with wild abandon, and now if she loses this job I don't know what will happen to her as she appears to be in massive debt. Scary.I need to make a plan now and am kicking myself that I didn't have a plan ages ago. In fact, everyone should have an exit plan from their job because you never really know when your employment will come to a screeching halt.Some things I won't do. Specifically, I won't work at a job that I don't like and/or work for people I don't like. And after years of watching how this particular group operates, I won't work for them unless they stay the Hell out of my way.I need to simultaneously bulk up my emergency fund, pay down my debts, and broaden my sources of income.  Immediately.My task for tomorrow is to come up with a plan so that if worse comes to worse, I will be ready."},
{"title": "Credit Card Free AND Car Free...How Weird is That?", "date": "Wednesday, November 11, 2009", "text": "A few posts ago I dramatized the end of my life as a credit card owner. It was slightly traumatic as I have always had credit cards. In fact, most people in our country have credit cards.I was just looking through my financial records and saw that is has been nearly two years since I went car free. No car. Most people in our country have cars. Like credit cards, I got fed up with car ownership much like I got fed up with credit card ownership.It was getting towards the end of the lease on my car, the price of gas was continuing to rise, and it suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks that I was spending nearly $1000 each month on a car. When I added up the exorbitant lease payment, insurance, gas, upkeep, annual registration fees, maintenance, and decorations (yes, I always decorate my cars), the cost nearly reached $1000 each month! Yikes. That's insanity unless you are like a millionaire which I am not.So I turned my car in and haven't looked back since. Actually, much like getting rid of my last credit card, getting rid of my car was extremely freeing. I actually like riding the bus. I like walking. I even like riding my bike if necessary to get to where I want to go.  I actually feel more in control without a car that I did with a car.If you dare to go car free, here's some tips:Check out your local public transportation options. The city bus may actually go when and where you need it to go. And when you look at the cost of a monthly bus pass compared to a monthly car payment, you will be very happy. There are also public transportation options such as Amtrak for further distances, Zip car, and car rental if necessary for weekend trips or big grocery shopping expeditions.Consider car pooling. In my case, I go to a lot of far-flung meetings but there are almost always other people from my office or related agencies going as well. Car pooling can work very well in these instances and my employer only needs to pay one person mileage instead of two. Note that Craigslist is another option for rounding up a car pooling ride and most major companies in our area as well as the local transportation agencies have ride share lists you can get on to coordinate rides with others who are going your way.Walking is another option is you live relatively close to where you need to go such as the bank, post office, library, or grocery store. Plus it's good exercise.Many people in our area commute by bike. I'm actually rather surprised how many bike riders are out on the roads during the early morning heading to work. I have a friend who rides 20+ miles each way to work!When you are car free, consider patience and preparedness. Since you don't have the speed and safety of an automobile to get you somewhere in a hurry and to act as a shield to protect you from things like the weather/traffic/other people, you need to do a couple of things. First, give yourself plenty of time to get to where you are going. You don't want to be running for the bus in the morning like you did in elementary school so leave early enough to casually walk to the bus stop. Also, be prepared. Wear good walking shoes, make sure you dress appropriately for the weather, carry a flashlight and wear a reflective vest if you will be walking in the early morning or late evening, and be aware of your surroundings (ie: don't walk through dangerous areas of town, etc).Check out car free living blogs and websites for good information and moral support.Much like getting rid of your credit cards, getting rid of your car can save you an outrageous amount of money which you can spend on other things that are more important to you.  Also, like getting rid of all of your credit cards, society at large is going to think you have lost your mind.  Which in my mind is just fine, the average person in our society is up to their eyeballs in debt, usually because of credit card and car payments, so like Dave Ramsey says, it's great to be weird.  Enjoy it!Personal note: We have one car in our family.  Hubby has kept his paid for car but has significantly decreased his use of it, choosing like me, to get a bus pass and ride the bus more often than drive.  Not only does this save money, save the environment, and save repairs/wear and tear on your car, it is also almost like having a chauffeur; many times I am delivered practically to the door of where I am going--no parking costs, no traffic to worry about.  If and when I ever decide to buy another car, you can be sure it will be with cash and on my own terms, it won't be because of a \"great deal\", the \"small monthly payments\", or a smarmy salesperson."},
{"title": "How I Funded My Emergency Fund", "date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2009", "text": "A few months back I got totally serious about getting out of debt. I had been listening to Dave Ramsey for maybe six months by then but still felt that there was no way I could even begin to get my baby emergency fund together let alone go without using a credit card for a month. How was I supposed to put $1000 aside? The only time my bank account sees that much money is the day after payday--a couple of days later it is always back to double digits as I use the money to pay my bills. Then I got irked at a credit card company.I used their credit card but not often and had a really low balance on it but for some reason I started getting more than a dozen calls A DAY from them saying that I was behind in my payment by a week or so. I wasn't behind in my payments with them though. I thought they had made a mistake and would figure it out but after three days of continuous calls (literally dozens a day from a computer) I called them and asked what the heck was going on. The lady checked my account, said she didn't know why it was happening, and said the calls would stop. That weekend we were having a garage sale so I used some of the proceeds to pay off the bill online. I then called back on Monday and told them to cancel my credit card. When she asked why, I told her if that (meaning the onslaught of computer calls) was how they treated their customers I wanted no part of giving my business to their company. She apologized but by then I was pretty irked so I insisted that she cancel the card. The feeling of having power over a credit card company--something that had never happened IN MY LIFE--was like your first hit of crack (I'm guessing...I've never used crack but it seems fitting what with the blissful high people talk about but that's a different blog...). Anyway, after that call I was psyched. I didn't feel like I had lost anything but rather gained something indescribable...like a mix of power, pride, and control.So my next step was to fund my small emergency fund with $1,000, then as quickly as possible pay off my last remaining credit card, figuring that instead of needing my credit card for a crisis I would actually have CASH to cover the things I would usually use my credit card for. So the ways that I both paid off the last credit card and funded my emergency fund at the same time included a mix of:Garage sales. We usually had one a year but this year had two. The first garnered about $500 and the second brought in around $200. I found that huge signs on the busy roads around our house coupled with ads on our local Craigslist brought people out of the woodwork...the road in front of our house looked like downtown LA at rush hour. Craiglist. I love Craigslist. Hubby was worried that murderers stalked the Craigslist site what with all of the bad publicity that came about after some high profile assaults and murders related to the site some time ago, but we have found nothing but wonderful people who have answered our ads. And we had plenty of ads. Everything that would bring more money via Craigslist than at a garage sale was advertised--basketball hoop, patio furniture, bikes, etc. all got sold.eBay. I usually sell small, higher value items on eBay such as cell phones, digital cameras, etc. We sold a couple of things this way which added to our emergency fund.Sold gold. One day driving down the street I heard a radio ad about selling your gold. I always heard that these places were a rip off but the idea of making money from the clump of broken gold chains and bracelets that had been collecting dust for over a decade was appealing. I called a local jeweler who had been in the community for ages and had a good reputation and found out that they bought gold. I immediately collected up all of my broken and unwanted gold things and brought them to the jeweler where he cut me a check for over $700! I hadn't seen or used that jewelery for literally more than ten years so it wasn't like I missed it when it was gone. So there you have it. Almost $2,000 earned within a couple of months that went to start an emergency fund and pay off my last credit card. When you are pissed off and totally intense, miracles can actually happen. Best of all, I used to use my credit card when I ran out of money justifying that I would pay off the balance the next month. With my emergency fund, I don't have that attitude. My feeling is that the $1,000 I have in my emergency fund is ALL that I have in case of an emergency. I would no more want to spend that money, even a little of it, even if I could repay it next month, than pull my eyes out. You don't have that same emotional feeling with a credit card."},
{"title": "Dave Ramsey's Seven Steps for Getting Out of Debt and Living Like No One Else", "date": "Monday, November 9, 2009", "text": "I kind of thought that it was a given that everyone knew Dave Ramsey's Baby Steps which will help you get out of debt then go on to become wealthy. I was talking to my sister the other day and realized there was at least one person who had no idea what I was talking about so it's likely there are others as well.First, if you want to get out of debt and become wealthy, you should listen to Dave Ramsey on the radio or via podcast or catch his TV show on Fox Business Channel each weekday. This is exactly why I am so motivated to become debt free and live on cash only. With like 99.9% of society evangelizing debt and small monthly payments, the average person is going to think that being in debt is the only way to live. Until you listen to Dave Ramsey and he pounds it in to your head that there is a better way to live. He is the perfect counter to consumerism and debtism run amok. As someone who has been in debt, bankrupt, and has managed to not only become debt free but to prosper for nearly 20 years with what are simple, common sense ideas, Dave Ramsey is the only person I would turn to for financial advice. Judging by the number of callers he gets on each show and the number of people who call in to scream \"I'm Debt Free\" on Fridays, I don't think I am the only person who feels this way.So anyway, you can click on the link above to read through his Baby Steps. Here is the condensed version:Put $1,000 aside to start an emergency fund (this is what you will rely on for emergencies instead of your credit cards).Pay off your debts using the \"debt snowball\". Pay off your bills, listed from smallest to largest, with the utmost intensity (it will go faster than you think if you focus on this one activity and live on beans and rice, rice and beans until you are done). Of course cancel and cut up your credit cards with each debt that is paid off.Once your debts are paid off, put three to six months worth of expenses away to fully flesh out your emergency fund.Once your emergency fund is totally funded, invest 15% of your income in Roth IRAs and pre-tax retirement programs.At the same time invest 15% of your income in a college savings plan for your kids.At the same time, pay off your home mortgage as quickly as possible.Now you get to build wealth and give some of it away! ...And live like no one else.Sometimes it is hard to be digging yourself out of debt and living cash free.  It can be stressful.  And boring.  Buying a new car is exciting.  One minute you are in your living room pondering a new car (which, since you just started considering the purchase a few minutes ago and haven't actually saved any money towards, means you will be going into debt to buy it) and the next thing you know you are in the dealer's show room preparing to sign away your hard earned income for the next six years or so.  The upside is that you leave with a beautiful new car that your neighbors will oohh and aawww at.Then there is the cash-only, living within your means way to buy a car.  You save money each month towards the car's purchase.  Meanwhile you drive a crappy car that the neighbors giggle at.  And you scrimp and save and drive the old car for a very long, boring time.  Eventually you have enough money to purchase a car with cash.  Since you are moving up from a clunker to a car that is nicer but not new, there is not a lot of pizazz in the process.  You find a decent car, you haggle, you haggle some more, and you drive away with what you hope will be a good car that gets you around efficiently and economically.  It probably won't be a car that is going to overwhelm anyone but that's OK. The point I am trying to make is that living below your means while saving to buy the things you want is boring and a really slow process.  No wonder credit cards are such a hit.  So when I get bummed out that I don't get everything I want NOW and when I am bored to death waiting for something fun (that requires an outlay of cash) to happen, I turn to a number of really inspirational sites on the web.  These sites are common sense, often times inspirational, blogs and websites from people who are doing the same thing I am trying to do and reaching small success milestones a little bit at a time.  Then I don't feel so bad, like I am the only one crazy enough to try to change my financial future.  Here are a bunch of great sites to check out:Dave Ramsey (I love Dave!)  Dollar Stretcher (lots of good articles and they sometimes buy articles from me!)Simple Dollar (lots of good tips and insight)Consumerist (news and articles about shady practices by companies that impact consumers)Enemy of Debt (a new blog I just found with a great name and inspiring articles)Saving Advice (a compendium of blogs by people from all walks of life trying to get out of debt)Deliver Away Debt (a guy who delivers pizzas to earn extra money just like Dave says to do.  Cool!)Man vs Debt (a family that sold everything to pay down debt and is cash flowing their world travel)Get Rich Slowly (nice name...that is what I intend to do.  Good articles too.)Less is Enough (I found this blog when the writer did an experiment to feed herself for a dollar a day for a month.  I like radical experiments.  I wish she would post more.)Wise Bread (this site has a cadre of great writers and interesting financial topics)Brip Blap (I like this guy's writing style.  Good articles on money)"},
{"title": "Success Update", "date": "Friday, November 6, 2009", "text": "My recent financial successes:All of my November bills have been paid by the first week of the month.  Usually I run out of money before I run out of bills so some payments can drag out until the end of the month.  I got my check today, paid down my list of bills due in November, and had enough money to pay everything on the list.  Amazing!I paid off and cancelled the last credit card I had.  Now I am credit card free.  Whoohooo!I currently have $1,200 in my emergency fund.  This is $1,200 that I can access at any time.  I have NEVER had this much in savings!I cancelled a vacation we had scheduled which we would have ended up using credit to pay for.  I think this was a really good decision which before I would never have considered.  I used to want what I want no matter what it cost and it didn't matter how it got paid for.  Now I am much more aware of my spending and have some semblance of control over it.  Wow."},
{"title": "25 Reasons Why I Hate Credit Cards", "date": "Friday, November 6, 2009", "text": "I hate credit cards.  They are like a drug that you get addicted to.  Pretty soon the thought of making a move without one or more credit cards at your side seems virtually impossible.  After a while though, you get mad.  Anger is a good motivator and anger at the whole credit card system (along with repeated Dave Ramsey lectures on TV) pushed me to the point that I abandoned credit cards all together.  Here's why I hate credit cards:Over limit fees.Late payment fees.Annual card fees.Universal default clause.Companies that slash your credit limits randomly.Crappy customer service.Companies that jack up your interest rates to loan shark levels.The ease with which it helps you spend money.The psychological reliance on a piece of plastic.The ease with which an addiction to spending can develop.The ease with which an addiction to collecting credit cards can develop.The way that being granted credit makes you feel superior, worthy, and important.The psychologically manipulative way that the color of a card makes you feel important...red...black...gold...platinum!The impact your credit card use has on your credit rating.The paper trail that using a credit card leaves.The fact that when you most need credit, like in a crisis, they refuse to increase your limit.  When you aren't in a crisis they seem to raise your limit randomly.The fact that people will use a credit card when they are having a crisis (job loss, etc) which actually has the affect of compounding their crisis (because then they have added debt to the mix).The greedy credit card companies.  If they treated people fairly, people wouldn't hate the credit card companies.The marginally illegal collection practices they and their collection agents use.The ease with which you can spend more than you can afford.The manipulative way they use \"incentives\" to keep customers.  Air miles that are virtually impossible to use, for example.The way that you can use a card to pay for a meal and still be paying off that meal two years later.The way that by paying the minimum amount due, you can actually be paying the card off for thirty years even without adding any more purchases!The changeable interest rates (they can raise your rates any time they want to while you have no say so over this even though you entered into the contract at a set interest rate).The changeable due dates.  Some credit cards seem to change their due dates monthly without giving you any notice so if you set the payment to recur on a certain date which worked the last few months, this month paying on that same date could cause a late payment.I hate credit cards!  Blah!I'm feeling light-headed. I'm feeling faint. My heart is racing. Am I having a panic attack? I'm not sure.Today I paid off my last credit card. I had paid of this card last month but rung up a couple of purchases on it this month so had a small balance on it which I paid off today. Then I called the company and told them I wanted to cancel it.I talked to one person who couldn't believe I would want to do such a thing. \"Don't you need it for emergencies?\" \"No, I have cash for emergencies.\" \"Uh...let me send you to a supervisor.\"Me to supervisor: \"I would like to cancel my credit card.\"Supervisor: \"Don't you want to keep it for emergencies?\"Me: \"I have cash for emergencies.\"Supervisor: \"You have cash set aside for emergencies??\" She sounded surprised.Me: \"Yep. I don't want any more credit cards and this is the last one I have to cancel.\"Supervisor: \"Oh\" Then a long pause.Supervisor: \"Can I add 10,000 air miles to your account so that you will keep the card?\"Me: (tempted) \"Uh no. I am finished with credit cards, please cancel it.\"So I did get the card canceled but it seemed like a traumatic transaction for both me and the supervisor. I have never been without a credit card since the day I turned 18 years old and I am now in my 40s. I feel like I have been on crutches for so long that even though I can walk fine and don't need crutches anymore, someone yanked the crutches away from me and I am left standing there feeling like I don't know what to do. Breathing deeply would be a good start, I guess.In theory, I am literally better off without the card than I was with the credit card. Before I would say I need a credit card for emergencies however I would keep the balance near the limit so the actual money I had on the card to use for an emergency was often less than $100. Now I have $1,200 in my emergency fund IN CASH that I can rely on in an emergency. Obviously I am now much more prepared for a financial emergency than I have ever been. I just takes some getting used to though."},
{"title": "Not Going into Debt Can be Tough...Especially When the Joneses Buy a New Mercedes", "date": "Thursday, November 5, 2009", "text": "My heart is set on living debt free and cash only.  I am slowly working my way out of debt inch by inch and I look forward to next week when I cancel my last credit card.  Today I talked to my sister-in-law who informed me that my other sister in law just bought a new Mercedes.  I don't know if I feel happy about it (happy for her because she does work really hard and kind of \"deserves\" it and even more happy that it isn't me signing up for years of car debt) or sad because I would really like a new Mercedes (or a new anything...the only thing I have now is a shiny bus pass and a hubby who lets me drive his old car any time I need it).  Also, I know that this particular brother and sister in law are up to their eyeballs in debt and have been for decades so I actually feel sad for them even though they will look nice driving around in their new car.So I think I will push my sadness aside and focus my attention on getting out of debt.  I will be thankful that I have a wonderful, supportive husband, thankful that we are both employed and our incomes easily pay our bills each month, thankful that with each paycheck we are slowly becoming debt free, and thankful that indeed, one day, I will be able to \"live like no one else\" as Dave Ramsey says and actually pay cash for any car that I want.  I bet the car will even drive better than new because it won't be dragging a payment book along behind it!"},

I seriously hate credit, creditors, debt, being broke, and all of the other negative things that go along with being a lousy money manager. Here's my goals:To be completely debt free including the house.To cancel my last remaining credit card.To spend only cash, with the occasional use of checks and debit cards, to pay bills or make major purchases.To have $10,000 in an emergency fund.To have a portable source of income so that I can travel more.To pay cash for a nice car.To have enough money in savings to cover a year's worth of bills (which should be easy once I have my debts paid off and only minimal monthly bills).To develop sources of passive income.To pay my taxes in full and on time.To write a book and have it published.To make wise decisions not only about my finances but also about my health, my future, and my life.Here's why:I have literally been in debt since I was 16.I have not lived without a credit card (actually a handful of them) since I was 18.I have never had an emergency fund. I've never had more than $100 in savings, and I always end up spending even that.I've never paid cash for a car...I've always paid years of car payments or lease payments for them.I have the bad habit of juggling my debts, bouncing checks, and making bad financial decisions.I have one bankruptcy, two car repossessions, and lots of late payments on my credit record. Ugh.I cringe when I get a letter from the IRS...and I cringe often :(I'm inspired by Dave Ramsey!I hate creditors, predatory lending, over limit fees, late fees, and fees in general.I want to control my money instead of my money controlling me.I have always been held back because of my debts--can't travel more than a couple of weeks because I need to get back and work, can't buy the latest gadget with cash because I am always broke, can't whisk the hubby away for a nice vacation or surprise him with a really cool present because...you guessed it, I am always broke!So I am starting now, this minute, to get my (financial) life in order.
