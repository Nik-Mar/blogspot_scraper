{"title": "Advent catch up!", "date": "Friday 1 December 2023", "text": "Two years have passed, it seems, since I was last here....Well, I have been popping in occasionally to navigate to other blogs, but I haven't posted. What a lot of change has been going on in blogland.So, the move to the south has brought change - and a lot of it: the girls now live in East Anglia with my dear UJ, who continues to be a faithful and wonderful presence in our lives. The EFG is a baker, working at her second bakery since taking up the trade about 18 months ago. She had had enough of working at Asda, and took a leap into a new world. Commercial baking is a world apart from domestic baking, and she makes things on such scale now that I can't get my head around it. She has been nominated, and shortlisted for an industry award as a promising newcomer already - she doesn't do things by halves!The YFG is now in her second year of teaching - the first year was a steep learning curve for her as she had a large class with a lot of challenging needs, in a school in a huge Multi Academy Trust, which has made resourcing her activities difficult and she did think about leaving there at the end of the first year, but then decided to stick it out until she has passed her ECT stage. That was called NQT when I was Chair of Govs years ago, but things change and it is now a two year process, but she seems to be getting there. She has a smaller group of children this year and seems more positive. I still think she will look for another post eventually, where she can focus on outdoor learning and Forest School work more.I was ordained in the summer and released from some of the oversight processes, which has been liberating. I LOVE my role here, and am thrilled to be doing this work. It is a world away from my previous life as I look back through the posts on here and remember breeding my beloved chickens, school governing, gymnastics coaching, etc - but that was that season and this is now - and it is good in different ways.I planted a tiny vegetable garden last year and grew beans, strawberries, raspberries, courgettes and butternut squash in it, with tomatoes in hanging baskets and in big pots. The weather down here was warm but very wet this summer so I don't think it did as well as it could have done, but I shall try again in the spring. The ground is incredibly hard to work as it is heavy clay, so I had to put the garden in as a raised bed. I might get another one in 2024 and expand a bit.The Christmas cakes are made and waiting to be iced, a lot of the presents for the various family members are purchased according to their wish-lists, and I am still knitting hats whilst I watch tv now and then. Some things don't change!!It is lovely to be \"back\" and I just hope that I get back more often now - we shall see! Lots of love xx"},
{"title": "New beginnings", "date": "Sunday 23 May 2021", "text": "I've been shamefully absent from this space, and I will completely understand if there is no one out there still reading! How much has changed in the world in the last year.....and how much has changed in our lives. I am one essay result away from saying I have passed my course at the college in Birmingham, and the OH and I will be moving to my first position in ministry in August - all the way to a town close to the south coast in West Sussex! From Carlisle to the south coast couldn't be much further apart, but that is the way it works and that is where we are going.... going to be quite an upheaval. There is no job on the horizon for the OH just yet though he is working hard to make connections down there as his time here comes to a close.  I am very excited about it all and can't wait to start work - it seems (it has!) taken years to get to this point!The YFG is going to teacher training college in Cambridge so she is going to live with UJ at his house, and the EFG is going with her in the hope of looking for a job in science communication in that area - there are going to be more opportunities in that area than there have been up here. They will be just over 2 hours away from us so I think we will see them quite often.The OH's son is hoping to be at uni in the north but will travel down to see us, and his father will travel up to see him and go on to Glasgow to see his parents as often as he can. We have to find ways to make this work for the next five years anyway.The sad news is that my dad died on Christmas Eve, and since the coroner and Covid delayed the funeral, it didn't happen until the end of January. Covid made travelling difficult so we decided, with sadness, not to go down but to watch via the crematorium livestream facility. My sister arranged with the coach company that Dad worked for to take his last journey in one of their coaches, and it was a very special day.  The OH's aunt died in America shortly after that and that was very sad - we had seen her on a Zoom call with her doctors just a few days before she died, but it was not Covid related - she had cancer. We were also able to watch her service of thanksgiving on livestream, but we were grateful to receive a transcript of the service from one of the relatives a few days later as the sound was not good.Those are the headlines of our lives in the last year - there is SO much more, but not the headspace to delve into it all. I want to start another blog to move into some recording of my thoughts as we move house and start a new life in the south, with all the changes that that will bring. I will think about that some more and see how it goes!My love to you all - I have been pottering around a few of the blogs in my sidebar occasionally over the last few months and I am so pleased to know your news."},
{"title": "Lockdown living", "date": "Tuesday 14 April 2020", "text": "Coronavirus exploded into our consciousness less than threemonths ago, and we have seen the different ways that various countries aroundthe world have dealt with it. What has fascinated me more, I have to be honest,is the way that individual people have managed to live in this enforcedlockdown period, and what I have been able to reflect and understand personallyabout that.Let’s take two men: one is in his mid-eighties, a retiredmedical consultant, married, living in the north. The other is a few yearsyounger, has had some health issues of his own, never married, lives in thesouth, has had two or three jobs in his lifetime, but has worked most of hislife on a farm. Before we go further, both of these men are dearly beloved ofthis family so all that I say is said with love and respect, but also withhonesty. Both are living alone as we go into the pandemic lockdown, and yetthey are each reacting quite differently to the situation.P, our consultant, used to spend his mornings playing golf,having coffee with some other retired gentlemen or doing some shopping. Hisafternoons were largely spent visiting his wife, who now resides in a carehome. He largely eats ready-meals, or simply prepared suppers. Evenings werespent at home, perhaps reading or watching some tv, unless there was a churchevent on, and once a month, he attended the history society talk. He lives in aflat, because the couple downsized some years ago, so he has no outside spaceto worry about. A, the agricultural worker, would potter in the garden andgreenhouses whenever the weather was fine, but he would amuse himself reading,watching some tv, doing jigsaws, baking, preserving his produce and preparinghis meals from scratch, largely using fresh produce from his garden in season,or previously frozen when not. He went to the bell-ringing group once a week,attended church some Sundays, and a pensioners’ lunch group on Wednesdays. Hehas a large house and about half an acre of garden to manage: he has lived inthe house for over 50 years now.Who is facing the biggest challenges in the lockdown? Towhose life has it made the most changes?A’s life goes on, pretty much as normal. Yes, he can’t go tochurch, nor the other activities that he did on a weekly or month basis, butday to day life has always been based around the home, and so he potters on.He’s glad of the phone calls from the church members and family each week, buthe has plenty to do, as ever, and keeps himself busy. It’s spring and there is lotsto do on the garden at this time of year.P is struggling. He can’t play golf, he can’t go out forcoffee with his friends, and very sadly, he is now unable to visit his wife. Mealsdon’t take long to prepare, and nothing else is happening that he counted onfor regular connections. The neighbours are all quiet in their respective flatsand he sees few people. He goes out for a walk most days, but there are limitedopportunities around his area, and he is bored of them, even having done them inboth directions!Having married P’s son in 2018, I can actually see that ourretirement years are going to be challenging to me. I am A’s niece, and thedifferent ways in which P and A are getting through this lockdown is mirroredin our home here. Many things which my husband does to relax have been barredfrom his life now – golf, badminton, swimming, Costa/Greggs coffees, the gym,outings to NT houses, for example. Holidays have been cancelled and it is allquite sad for him. He is grieving these losses and they have hit him quitehard. A and I come from a working class background, what onecommentator has called “Northern” this week, which I find a deep honour as somany positive qualities emanate from the north, but the truth is that myhusband and his father both have greater claims to that moniker than do I.However, what I do lay claim to is to thriftiness and frugality, which A has inspades. We have no history of leisure activities that cost money – Heavenforbid – we play draughts, we play whist, we read, we bake, we create with yarnand fabric and plants and seeds, we work in the garden for exercise and we takepleasure in our rest. There is a contentment in this that is inexplicable. P and his son have had no need of such frugal ways in the past,and find it hard to adjust to them now. P is too old to want to learn to cookat his age with any great challenge, for example. They have expectations ofhaving the finances to maintain this lifestyle, and that is not now theirproblem – the lifestyle is as unavailable to them as it would be to anyone,whatever their pecuniary fortune. It is just not possible to do the things theylove because of the lockdown and the social distancing rules. If your background is one of financial challenge, as mineis, I think that we have been blessed for such a time as this, when all that weknow is a bonus, that our time can be filled with simple pleasures that costnothing and can easily be done at home, that we are content with relativelyplain joys, with no great expectations.I spoke with both P and A yesterday. I love them both, andwe will continue to ring them both regularly. For P, our phone calls are alifeline to relieve his boredom and to keep his morale at least tolerably high,because his world has been turned upside down in these past few weeks. Hisseparation from his wife just now is particularly troubling and he is veryconcerned for her. In that, he has my greatest sympathy.  For A, this different way of living is a bitof an inconvenience, but he has weathered numerous storms in his lifetime andthere is within him an admirable depth of resilience that recognises theseriousness of the pandemic but that says this too shall pass. Let’s hope he’sright!"},
{"title": "Easter Day", "date": "Sunday 12 April 2020", "text": "He Is Risen!Easter Day has come, kind of in a whisper here in the city. The churches buildings are silent, I haven't heard any bells ringing, and when the OH and I went into the back garden to sing \"Thine be the our glory,\" this morning, our audience was just two robins who flitted from tree to tree, but did stay the distance, bless them! It is, for most of us, an Easter Day like no other.  Some things have stayed the same: there is a mountain of chocolate in the sitting room - 18 Easter eggs between the 5 of us - and we have had a lovely roast chicken dinner tonight, followed by Rhonda-Jean's self-saucing chocolate pudding (from Down-to-Earth blog) and/or apple crumble. My stepson, like a lot of 17 year old boys, is a bottomless pit at the moment and seemed to eat his weight in roast potatoes and two helpings of chocolate pud, bless him. That seems to be life at the moment: some things stay the same and others are just so very very different. I thought about the disciples this morning as we did an Easter egg hunt in the garden. Mary searched the place near the tomb for someone to tell her what had happened to her Lord. Easter and gardens seem to me to be inextricably linked - Nadia Bolz Weber shared a section from one of her books today on her Facebook account where she talks of Jesus being mistaken for the gardener and wonders whether he had the dirt from the tomb still under his nails, surmising that if he was indeed mistaken for a gardener, he might have looked a bit rough around the edges, so to speak!  But this was the risen Lord and yet Mary did not recognise him until he spoke her name.I am constantly bothered by the reporting of the deaths from coronavirus at the moment and how we seem to just hear numbers, unless the person who has died was a high profile figure, like Tim Brooke-Taylor, whose death was reported today. But every single person who has died from this terrible disease was a husband, wife, sister, brother, son, daughter, cousin, or whatever - they were people who had lives, histories, families, stories, hobbies, preferences, funny habits, memorable foibles - they were individuals. They have names. Names are intimate, names are special, they identify us. And when Jesus identified Mary by her name, she knew that it was him - the one to whom she was special. The one who was special to her. As a lay pastor, I have often talked of having a ministry of presence, in which I listened to a great many stories, giving people my time, and holding space for them to talk and be heard. It has always felt to me that the greatest cry of the human heart is to be known, and that is one of the most precious gifts that we can give to another - to really take the time to get to know someone, to cherish their stories by actually listening to them, holding on to them and remembering them.  As I take my next steps on my journey into ministry, I fully intend to continue this work because I have heard Mary's joy in being recognised in this story and I have seen an old lady's eyes light up when I have recalled her story. As we go forward into the next weeks and days, and we continue to spend time with our loved ones, in person at home or via phone lines and technological wizardry, let us all take time to listen, to hear and to cherish, so that we might truly know one another well. I hope that you have had a blessed Easter Day today, however you have spent it, and that in the days ahead, however you spend them and however long this lockdown needs to last, you will be safe and well."},
{"title": "Holy Saturday", "date": "Saturday 11 April 2020", "text": "Today the weather has been lovely and we have spent some time in the garden. The sky has been a glorious blue and clouds have been sweeping along on the wind. The washing has dried and the birds have been singing their little hearts out in the trees. It has been really nice.How very different from how we imagine that day when Jesus was in the tomb: how very sad and grieving were his family and friends, his disciples and his followers. So much promise, so many hopes,  all dashed as he died on the cross yesterday. Today his body lies in the tomb, safe behind the massive rock that was placed at the entrance.Today I have read reflections which have said that yes, that rock was there to keep Jesus' body safe from grave robbers who may have wanted to take it away, but other reflections saw that rock as symbolic to the obstacles in our way during our lives, the burdens that hold us back. Perhaps you can see both sides of that? I can, but I think I prefer today to think of the rock as holding Jesus' body safe whilst the battle raged for Christ to overcome death and to be resurrected. That resonates for me with the current war we are waging against corona virus - and all our front doors are shut tight to keep us safe whilst the scientists and frontline workers do battle on our behalf, just as Christ did back then.To be shut in a tomb would be a nightmare for someone who suffers from claustrophobia, a dark place with no light, no air, no windows, and no easy way out. There are a number of films in which people get locked in mausoleums, and I have every sympathy for those characters.  I woke up one morning this week in the early hours, got up and flung open the window, muttering, \"I must have air!\" before getting back into bed. We sleep in pitch blackness with blackout blinds, and the windows are usually closed: the OH doesn't sleep well and is sensitive to every noise and possible disturbance. This isn't the way I want to sleep but one has to make sacrifices for those one loves, at least occasionally! But I can imagine that a tomb would be like that - dark and airless - and how desperately one who was alive would want to escape... And we want this experience now to be over, we want to be able to get out and live in the world again, free to see our friends and family, to be able to travel and enjoy life - this lockdown feels like incarceration to some, I am hearing, and I am so sorry for those who feel like that.Just as we are promised that Sunday is coming, that Resurrection is coming, that the resurrected Christ is coming, we can be sure that the end of this lockdown will come eventually. The question for me is one of wondering how we will be different after it? The Risen Christ is different from Jesus, and the world, for the disciples at least, is different once they know that Christ has risen - how will we find the world when we emerge again? It is going to take longer than tomorrow morning for us, but will we be ready? Can we take hold of all the lessons of community spirit, of caring for one another, of generosity and appreciation, and live differently in a post-pandemic world?"},
{"title": "Good Friday 2020", "date": "Friday 10 April 2020", "text": "Good Friday 2020Thisafternoon, as I sat in the garden with a cup of tea, taking a break from thekitchen, I heard a chainsaw somewhere in the neighbourhood. My thoughts turnedto Jesus’ cross, and who might have made it, and the irony of a carpentermaking a cross upon which another carpenter would die. I wondered how thatmight have felt. My thoughtsthen turned to how those of us who create things feel about our creations. Ihave spent much of the day in the kitchen, making brownies, lemon cake, andbanana bread, and then I helped my stepson make a steak pie for tea. The bananabread was the only disaster – I made it with every good intention but it hasunfortunately ended up beyond edible and only fit for the birds. I have a senseof disappointment about that.  Despitethat, I am happy that the other cakes turned out well and can be enjoyed. I amhappy although I know that my creations will soon disappear.Lots of usare creative, but I think there is a special kind of person who can makesomething knowing that it will be destroyed. I think back to July 2014 when myelder stepson spent hours lovingly crafting a wooden coffin for his father’sbody, knowing that within days that beautiful creation would go up flames inthe crematorium. I remember the grace and love with which he worked on thatprecious project. And so mythoughts turned to God, sending his beloved Son to be our Messiah, knowing thatthe fulfilment of scripture would be the breaking of that precious body on thecross. For me, I know that my God would have felt enormous pain in that death,although God knew that the resurrection would come. On this day,I feel sadness and pain at the way Jesus was treated, how shameful his deathbecause humanity “knew him not” and for me, it is a day of regret andpenitence; when I think about what my faith means to me and how I live [or failto live] for Christ. But today I found some respite in realising that God knowsabout seasons and intentions: that God sent Jesus to be with us, for a season,and that Jesus had a purpose – to bring humanity back to God – and then histime would be done. To have a grasp of that, I can remember that othercreations, though far less divine, might also just be for a season, and that wemight hold on to them more lightly if we realised that. Loss isdevastating, and as a widow, I know that – I might be the OH’s wife now but Iwill always be the FH's widow. In this terrible pandemic, the global society islosing loved ones at an alarming rate, and the way that death is having tohappen in the current circumstances is incredibly sad: those who die separatedfrom their loved ones, and the families and friends unable to be with them yetdesperate to share last words, last loving words, and the anguish that thatcauses will always be unanswerable. In this awful season, I draw somecomfort from knowing that Jesus knew the pain of dying alone on that cross, andthat God knows the pain of that separation too.Lord Jesus,who knows our every pain, we pour out our regret today, our sadness and ourrepentance. Forgive us, for our sins as we remember your gift of yourself forus. Don’t let us hold on to things which are past, when you want us to give ourenergy to the future. Don’t let us live in the sadness of Good Friday andoverlook the hope of the days yet to come. Amen."},
{"title": "A Reflection for Maundy Thursday", "date": "Thursday 9 April 2020", "text": "John 13.1-20Maundy Thursday in lockdown is different from any other: we are unable to come together to worship, to share Communion, to recall that Last Supper in the upper room. I have had some memorable experiences on this day through the years, all of them spent in congregational groups. We have to find another way through this one, and perhaps for me, it is a call to a greater intimacy with Christ instead of hoping to share it with others.Studying for Methodist ministry as a student deacon, I am more drawn to John's account of this night with the powerful description of Jesus as he humbly tied a towel at his waist and knelt right down there to wash his disciples' feet. There is an intimacy, a gentleness, in the description and it feels to me as if Jesus would have been careful to wash each foot thoroughly, taking his time and concentrating on one after the other. I can imagine the others watching as he made his way around the room, each perhaps slightly incredulous that their master, their leader, was on his knees washing their feet in that most lowly of roles.Feet are a very personal part of our anatomy - we often keep them covered up in shoes for much of the year in this country, and it is very different from the context back then. Their feet were exposed to dirt and dust and even dung, if we are honest, and they must have needed a good washing very often! How different from the faint and slightly cheesy pong that might emanate from a pair of shoes we have had on all day! I recall the Bible stories that tell of how the disciples walked miles with Jesus and think of how important it would have been to them to have had healthy feet, able to walk those miles with him.  Many of us don't like to have people touching our feet and the instances of public foot washing these days are lessening. Pope Francis caused a stir in 2015 by washing the feet of prison inmates and then in 2016 of refugees - this is a pope who is not one for staged niceties but actually gets out there with real people.Today as I write this, my feet are nicely wrapped up in socks and trainers, and probably will be so for most of the day. That will enable me to do kitchen work, pop in and out to the garden, be comfortable and make sure that I don't tread on anything dodgy in my bare feet in the garden. I do however live with a family who prefer bare and stockinged feet so I'm different. It is good to be different sometimes! Indeed, Christ calls us as his followers to be different in his name, to live for him and in him whilst being in the world, in order to show the world what he brings to our lives.This Maundy Thursday, as I think about the foot washing in John's gospel, I know that my calling is to be alongside people like me who might need a bit of a spruce up, spiritually, mentally or physic; to listen to stories - and some of them are painful to share, to hear and to hold; and to be as close as I can be to Christ as I allow him near my vulnerable places, to allow him to wash me clean. I am always in need of his forgiveness, and he promises that there is nothing we can do which can overcome his love for us, so he will always wash us clean when we come to him in repentance. He calls us to wash one another's feet, to a holy intimacy of care for one another, and that is the lockdown message at the moment - stay at home and protect the vulnerable - and so we can do that in his name, to his glory and by his word. Let's show that love for one another by staying at home!Father, as we remember Christ's passion this week, as we stay apart and are unable to share together in person, grant us your peace in this situation. As we think of the intimacy of the foot washing, grant us wisdom to know who might need a personal word of encouragement this week, whispered quietly or written lovingly in a letter. Help us by your grace to have some measure of Christ's gentleness with others today. Amen."},
{"title": "Thank you", "date": "Sunday 5 April 2020", "text": "It was really exciting to see your comments appearing in my inbox over the last few days. Thank you for your warmth and encouragements - much appreciated.I'm now in my third week of not going out, and it is fine for me - I have so much to do that it is not, for me, a big deal not to be going here and there. I explained to the OH the other day that it is actually a great freedom from the routine of life at college that I am not expected to be anywhere or do anything at a particular time just now. My time is my own and it is like a little sabbatical from the quite rigorous expectations of the college routine.Life at college is very regimented: 0915-1215 lectures, with a half hour break for coffee. 1230 - 1300 Chapel 1300 lunch. That much is the everyday routine. Then we have Cell groups once a week - we meet on Tuesdays at 1400. Some weeks there is a community meeting at 1530 for an hour. At 1700 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays there is a communion service, and it is mandatory to attend one or other. Dinner on those days is provided and is served at 1800. Wednesday afternoons is mostly free, but there has been a lecture on Thursday afternoons both terms so far, until 1600 in the first term and 1645 in the second. After that, I'm preparing to travel - I come home on the 1915 out of Birmingham New Street on Thursday evenings which gets me back here around 2200 if I am lucky.  And then I am at home until about 1645 on Sunday afternoons when the OH takes me back to the station here to head back south to Brum. Another student travels from Wigan so we meet up at the station and go back to college together most weeks.When I am in the college, the routine feels comforting and regular, but once released from it, I have taken some time to adjust to a new schedule at home in the past few weeks. The YFG and I exercise in the mornings, taking over the sitting room for our DVD sessions, by which time the OH has done half an hour on the exercise bike and disappeared off to shower and then to his study. I make a point of cleaning all the \"contact points\" in the house each morning, which for me are door handles, light switches, taps and toilet flush handles, the doors/handles/dials of the white goods like the fridge, the washing machine, the microwave and the freezer, and then the knobs of the cooker and the oven handle. The kettle handle and lid finish it off and I am done - though if I have missed anything that you clean regularly, do shout. I do also clean the doorbell, the letterbox and the door handles at the front door too - we are having quite a few online deliveries at the moment.I am finding that housekeeping is a comforting routine and I have even done some baking again. I bought a new bread machine a few weeks ago and have enjoyed digging out old recipes and making them again. So pleased to read that some of my old recipes shared here are still in regular use! The sausage plait is a recipe we introduced to the OH the other month and he enjoyed it too. He doesn't eat much cake, though he is a bit of a stress-eater of chocolate.  I have to say though that we have discovered that when everything is clean (crockery AND clothing), there isn't enough room in the cupboard for all the mugs, and the wardrobe is a bit stuffed - I think that the OH was quite used to his laundry cycle taking a long time pre-marriage and had bought quite a lot of clothes....now that the washing cycle is faster, more of them need to be in the wardrobe at the same time!!The YFG gave me a FatFace knitting kit to make a bobble hat in 2015, and I still haven't made it, so I dug it out this morning and it may become my pandemic project!  The girls have got out the YFG's sewing machine and there has been much going on in the conservatory - the EFG has learned remarkably quickly! She is also involved in some online projects, like learning Norwegian, so she is keeping herself occupied whilst the YFG and I are studying.Today is Palm Sunday, so the OH and I have decorated the front window with green paper palm leaves, and we shared a simple spiritual activity together before lunch. There is a multiplicity of worship currently available  online, mostly through Facebook connections, but he is working hard to keep in touch with less technological congregants. We have heard today of his first member to go into hospital with an infection so he is worrying about her, but there is no indication yet that it is Covid19. He is in touch with the family and we are praying. The niece of another member has sadly died, so we are remembering that family too.I give thanks for this community in times like these - for the encouragements, for the resources, for the sharing and the kindnesses, for the inspiration. We don't know what the future holds in the coming days, but we travel the road in the company of Jesus and those whom we love, and we can draw a little comfort from that, I believe.  Stay safe, keep well and keep in touch with all for whom you care and pray.Back soon xx"},
{"title": "Anyone there?", "date": "Saturday 28 March 2020", "text": "Oh my goodness - we are back!This seemed the right time to come back to this space again - whether anyone is out there reading it or not, it will be a record of these days for us in the future.Coronavirus has come to Carlisle in significant numbers, much higher numbers than the Fens are currently experiencing, apparently. The YFG's uni has closed and moved all lectures online until September, so she is  home with us, and the college I attend in Birmingham has also closed for the foreseeable future: we are waiting to hear from the tutors how we are going to be taught next term.A bit of catching up seems necessary:The EFG passed her Masters at Edinburgh with Merit and moved home with us in July last year. She has been applying for lots of science jobs and had many interviews but nothing has come right for her just yet. She was taken on by Asda in the pre-Christmas boom and is still there - she has a 16 hour contract but usually works up to twice that as they haven't enough staff. She is currently off with pay for about a month as she has asthma and we want her to stay at home whilst the virus peaks. She will review that situation at the end of the period.The YFG has been thriving in many areas of her life, like uni and gymnastics, but she's battling some health issues. We finally got to a consultant in January, who ordered an MRI and a colonoscopy, as well as multiple blood tests. The next appointment to go back is in June. He seemed convinced that her issues might be in the bowel, but she had another very painful three hour episode in the middle of the night Thursday night, and I am still more convinced that it is something to do with her gallbladder....we shall see.  The Geography degree course had included a week in a major international city as part of one of the modules, so they started off aiming for Hong Kong but the rioting stopped that, and they moved the plan to Singapore,  which the virus outbreak ended. London was on the cards for about a week and now, of course, all travel has been cancelled, so they will have to redesign that module, she thinks, or change their plans!My stepson started his A level courses in September and is working incredibly diligently at RS, PE and Geography. The OH is working hard to support his congregation in the midst of this - we can more easily contact those who have the internet but we are desperately working on communications with those who are limited to less high-flying tech like radio, television and phone. He spends time on the phone each afternoon making pastoral phone calls to his flock, and has written a service to share with his people each week so far that the churches have been closed.I've LOVED the college course in Birmingham and it has been a wonderful experience - the 18 of us in my cohort all get on together quite well, and we spend each morning [Monday - Thursday] in lectures, as well as Thursday afternoons. The college is a great place and the accommodation is very comfortable - single study bedrooms with en-suites, and lunch provided every day, as well as two evening meals. I have passed every module so far - no exams, just essay writing, and I am currently working on another set of essays to be handed in early April.My dad had his 90th birthday in October and we had a very small get together which I was able to attend with the OH. Dad is definitely very frail, but he has care in the mornings to help his partner, and he remains in good spirits - the thing with my dad is that he is incredibly content!I shall sort out some photos soon and get them on here, but I promised that last time and they didn't appear, so don't hold your breath. That last trip to the Cotswolds was lovely, then we had a few days near Pickering in July. We spent a weekend in Crieff followed by a couple of days in St Andrews to celebrate our first wedding anniversary so last year we did get around quite a bit. Oberammagau was on the cards for this summer but they have postponed the performance until 2022, so we shall have to rebook for then.Take care of yourselves and do say HELLO if you pop in!"},
{"title": "Results are in, decisions are made", "date": "Wednesday 5 June 2019", "text": "image from https://www.enidblytonsociety.co.uk/st-clares.phpThat might give you a clue, friends! I'm to commute to Queen's in Birmingham on a weekly basis, beginning in September, for a two year course. I shall start in the first year with a Certificate in Theology, Mission and Ministry, and aim to convert it to a Diploma in the second year. There's the opportunity to convert it to a BA and continue to do it as probationer studies, but let's not put the cart before the horse, as they say!It's a challenge I'm looking forward to but I have to be honest and admit that the thought of going back to uni in my later forties is a bit daunting. No one that I have met in the process so far is doing that same arrangement, as they are all either doing the part time option or already live in Birmingham and will come in on a daily basis. I dare say, though, that I shall find new friends and cherish my existing contacts through email and messages, and will meet up very occasionally. We shall be ships that pass in the night, as they will come to Queens for 7 weekends each year on the part time pathway, and I shall be at home on weekends!It is a term-time arrangement over 33 weeks of the year, and so I shall still be at home for long periods at Christmas, Easter and the summer, which is good when one has not long got married!!The OH is a bit peeved though that my half term is not closer to our first wedding anniversary - Queens seems to go along with Birmingham school holidays rather than Cumbrian ones, naturally, and my week off falls a week later........he had something up his sleeve apparently and he is \"sad\" that we can't take that week together. For \"sad\", one can actually read, \"very sad, verging on devastated.\" But that is life, and we are now, more than ever, going to be bound by terms!I have handed in my notice with my job and will finish at the end of July. We've a Norfolk holiday planned in August and I shall see my family as well in that window of opportunity. Form filling will be the next chore - I had just got my tax return done, thank goodness - but there will shortly be forms to fill in for the college, and then for the church, to apply for funding etc. The course is fully sponsored by the church, so I have no loans to apply for, which is a blessing, and they give me a monthly bursary to keep me fed and clothed. And, joy of joys, I have discovered that despite being far from the 16-25 age range, I can apply for a railcard as a mature student, which will help the finances of the weekly train journeys to and from Birmingham no end.The girls are doing well - the EFG is busily doing her dissertation and has her head down, working hard, but managed almost a week here with me not long ago, and that was lovely! The YFG has her last exam of the year tomorrow and then she will be home a week on Saturday, for a short while, before she heads off to Uganda for three weeks...... My stepson is in the midst of his GCSEs and I had a lovely message from him tonight, reminding me that it is a maths exam tomorrow and he will \"just do his best\" - he and I have worked together on some maths and he has a brilliant mental maths ability but doesn't always write down all the workings so he misses out on vital marks. He hopes to do A levels in September so we are praying he gets the results he needs to do those. Your comments and good wishes are a wonderful encouragement to me. Being completely honest, these last six months have not been a bed of roses. I'm still coming to terms with all that I have left behind in the Fens, and the distance between me and those I love there still. I'm getting used to being married to a man I had only really seen on high days and holidays, and the nitty gritty of working life for both of us has been quite different - and he is a younger man with a much more independent streak than the FH ever had, so I have to get used to allowing him to do things his way (and ooh, that's hard sometimes, when of course, I think my way is better ;) but I am getting there!) I'm also dealing with the loss of my beloved bridesmaid, a different job which I haven't really enjoyed very much, although the people are amazing, AND not really having had much opportunity to really make connections within my own denomination here. But God is GOOD, always, and I have been blessed with some brilliant new friends, some dedicated old friends who go the extra mile to keep in touch, daughters who are loving, mature and kind, a stepson who has taken me as I come, and most importantly, a very loving husband who adores me. There is much joy in all of this, despite the challenges, and whilst I do occasionally look back and wonder, I am doing that less and less as God points me forward to the way ahead and asks me to bloom where I am planted [Jer 29.4-14].We have just had a week off together in the Cotswolds, and when I can move the photos from the phone to the laptop, via email, I shall share that with you too: it was lovely!"},
{"title": "Folks, they said yes!", "date": "Friday 12 April 2019", "text": "I was going to wait until I had the whole story to share, but I have had a gentle nudge so I'm back with what I know so far!! The selection committee of the Methodist Church has recommended me to be trained as a deacon. That bit is the good news.What is still uncertain is as to how they intend to do that - there are several options and I still have to attend an interview at The Queen's Foundation in Birmingham on 10th May which will enable them to make the final decision - and I will know the week after. They could send me to Queen's full time as a weekly boarder Sun-Thurs term time for two academic years, or they could train me part time over three years. Both have pros and cons but after lots and lots of discussions here, we think we are coming down in favour of the two year option so that we can get on with it - but the Church has the ultimate decision - and we might ourselves have changed our minds after further chatting by the time the interview comes round. There is just so much to consider.The interview process last month was just brilliant - the people were amazingly supportive and kind, and we all just felt very cocooned in the environment as we went through the procedures. It was good!  Nerve-wracking, but good!!"},
{"title": "The time is drawing near...", "date": "Friday 22 March 2019", "text": "Nearer and nearer draws the time, as the hymn assures us! The time for the big round of interviews for ministry has just about arrived: I'm leaving to head south in the morning, and will go to the conference centre where the interviews are held, on Monday. I will be there in various rounds of interviews from 3pm Monday for 24 hours, and should get home Wednesday afternoon. Praying for wisdom and discernment on the part of the interviewers, and courage and calmness, inspiration and blessing from God for me in this process - I am nervous and it feels a bit like I'm about to sit an A level in Methodism without really knowing what's on the curriculum - the scope for the questioning is vast! Many thanks for all your support and kind words since the last post - glad to be here and to hear from you all.  The outcome of the interviews will be made known to us on 3rd April, so if I don't get back here before then, I shall hope to be back with news shortly thereafter.I've got a virus at the moment so I am resting as much as I can and will be taking the journey tomorrow in lots of stages! I spent Tuesday in bed and only ventured out briefly Thursday though I went to work this afternoon for an hour and came home exhausted and had to sleep for an hour to get some energy back... This is partly why I am travelling tomorrow - so that I can rest on Sunday before I have to go to the centre on Monday.Much love to you all!"},
{"title": "From the North", "date": "Friday 8 February 2019", "text": "Yes, I'm now blogging from the north instead of from the east - I moved up here at the end of October, and am just about finding my way around: I still get lost but not as often as I did to start with, and rely less on the satnav to find Sainsbury's!The EFG is half way through her post grad course at Edinburgh - it is hard work but she is enjoying the placements and working hard. The YFG is entrenched in Newcastle life and producing some satisfying essay results, so we have to be reassured that she is well able to manage sports, social and work lives to the max! She has joined the Gymnastics club and is participating again as a gymnast so we hear tales of what she has been able to do in the gym each week. Next week she flies off to Berlin with the Geography Society for three or four days of adventure, and in the summer, she is going with a group to Uganda for three weeks - there is no stopping this one! There is a fundraising campaign underway as she will be working with an organisation called East African Playgrounds to build a playground at a school, and she has to make a sizeable donation to that cause as well as pay for her trip.The two cats, his and mine, have settled in to some kind of truce that only brings about hissing if they meet in a confined space like a doorway or on the stairs, but his is out a lot of the time and my old lady cats spends her days sleeping in the sun, so there aren't too many arguments. Mine has yet to step foot outdoors on her own - the girls took her out very briefly at Christmas but she was on a lead. She has settled into the cattery now, having been there three or four times, and gets on well with the owner, whom she allows to give her her medication, which she won't yet let my husband do! He has had the scratched hands to prove his willingness to try though....I've got a new job working for an Anglican parish in the city as a community worker, 20 hours a week. I just started that last month, so I am really just getting going with that.Two pieces of news, one good and one sad....  our beloved bridesmaid, my co-worker in the Fens, who wasn't going to let me leave the Fens unless she could be my bridesmaid, died in December, scarcely two months after the wedding. She was diagnosed with lymphoma on 7/11, having gone into hospital on the 5th. She never came home. I went to stay with a friend so that I could visit for two days, whilst she was in Critical Care, but when I left, she was hoping to be moved back to the ward, but she took a turn for the worst, and didn't get any better, suffering multiple heart attacks, and dying just before Christmas.  The Fens ministry team, which was the Super, the new minister and I, conducted the cremation service and the service of celebration of her life together at the end of January. It was a very sad occasion but it was a joy to remember all that she had loved, done and wanted to share in life - she was passionate about sharing the gospel and so we reflected on that in the service and shared much of her life with others - the church was packed and about 50 or so folk had to stand or perch on the cushions around the communion rail! That was an accurate reflection of the love that people had for her, and respect for how she lived her life for God.The better news is that the District Candidates' Committee have unanimously recommended that I go forward to the Connexional [national] committee next month, which is great! It was a very challenging experience to get through, in the same week as the funeral, but it was positive and affirming in its approach, and they were all lovely people. Now I have to go to London next week for an interview with the warden and deputy warden of the Methodist Diaconal Order, and then wait to know the exact dates I'm to attend the national committee - I know which week it is but not yet which 24 hour period. Those of you who pray, I'd be grateful to be included in your prayers as this discernment process continues.And so I continue to settle into life up here: days at work, days off, trips into the Lakes for walks, the odd cinema visit [Mary, Queen of Scots and The Green Book most recently], odd visits to Newcastle and Edinburgh, exercise - I've joined the local pool/gym and swim now three or four times a week, worshiping with three denominations over the course of each month, taking the odd service here and there, although I shall be back on the plan properly from next month and preaching regularly for the Methodists, but I am also taking occasional services for the Kirk.God is good and continues to bless us, amongst the challenges, and we are doing well. I'm happy to be here with my husband [he needs an abbreviation if I'm going to blog regularly again!], not far from my girls, and finding my way.....Thanks for dropping in xx"},
{"title": "Wedding day fast approaches", "date": "Friday 5 October 2018", "text": "Two weeks tomorrow is the day we plan to get married! Life is hurtling past at speed and the day is fast approaching - and it is exciting and scary at the same time....The EFG graduated from Aberdeen in June and did well enough that she is now doing postgraduate studies at Edinburgh uni - still in Scotland, bless her! The YFG has just started at Newcastle uni to do Geography. Once I get to Carlisle at the end of the month, we will all be within a reasonable distance of one another. Graduation was a special day in June when the chap and I went up to Aberdeen to share it with the EFG. We arrived the day before and took her out for a meal that night as she was going to the graduation ball the night of the graduation, and the chap had to hike back to Cumbria on the train to go to work again the next day. I was able to stay and bring her and all her stuff back home - the Yeti was packed to the maximum capacity! It has been great to have her here all summer and to have some precious time together.... although my dad did very generously send them off on a cruise in July - they saw some of the coastline of Croatia and Italy, embarking the boat at Malta so the trip included their first experiences of flying. They did very well and enjoyed every minute.I had a more sedate holiday in Northumberland in a cottage at Belford with the chap and his son, and the YFG joined us for most of the time.The house has just about sold - God's been teaching me a valuable lesson about trusting him for the times that things happen so He has brought us to this point before the right buyer came along! I had three couples all wanting to buy the house but all subject to selling their own properties - and then a young first time buying couple came along so that there is absolutely no chain: it is just them buying this house.  I do suspect that they may be getting some parental support with the purchase, but as long as they come up with the money, I will be happy - and it is such a weight off my mind to know that I don't have to rent it out or leave it on the market once I am gone from here.And I shall be gone from here in about three and half weeks - a man and a van are booked and we head north on the 31st.  I shan't be growing in the fens any longer, but I'm certain I still have a lot of learning and growing to do.  Cogitating in Cumbria? Maturing in the mountains? From Fens to Fells? We'll have to think of something!I have officially stopped working here now and my time is focused on the candidating procedure for the ministry, packing, organising last minute things about the wedding and wondering how to fit it all in. I was quite stressed at the beginning of the week but I seem to have calmed down a little bit now, thank goodness. The YFG is nipping home tomorrow until Tuesday due to some cancelled lectures, so I am looking forward to hearing more about her first two weeks in Newcastle - she has already connected with a gymnastics club there so she clearly has her priorities straight!"},

Weird to realise that I haven't been here since last August....The EFG went back to uni in September and has just today had her final exam. She should get the results on the 25th May and then graduates in June - and I have to fetch her and all her stuff home! She's looking at post grad courses in Edinburgh or Bristol at the moment, depending on the results.The YFG has had quite a year: she's continued working at the cathedral six days a week and then she has got jobs in two different gymnastics clubs to work to gain experience for doing a Level 2 coaching qualification - and she passed the final assessment for that about two weeks ago! She works in one capacity or another 7 days a week and has not had much time to herself at all. She has applied herself to it all very well and done herself credit. She has also applied to uni again and has accepted an unconditional offer to go to Newcastle to read Geography in September.And me? I'm working hard in the church, full time now - 37 hours a week. The Superintendent is currently off sick for a long period so I am holding the fort with three supernumerary ministers [retired] and today an acting Superintendent has been appointed to work with us from a distance - he will advise by telephone and email and come over for big meetings but not be here on a day to day basis.I'm pursuing the process to candidate for the Methodist ministry as a Deacon - this is an Order of ministry which is permanent - we do not have Deacons who are on their way to becoming presbyters. This is the calling I have and I feel very settled on it so I hope that the selection committees affirm it and put me forward. I have a long process to get through and won't know whether they are accepting me until next March.By that time, [drum roll] I will be married and living in Cumbria!The chap and I are getting married here in the Fens in October in my big church and the house is on the market so that I aim to move up there to be with him permanently after we are married. If God wills it, the house will sell at the right time and all will work out. Let's pray that it all comes together!2018 is turning out to be one heck of a year - marriage, candidating, moving house, YFG off to uni, EFG graduating!!  It won't be a year to forget in a hurry....I shall attempt to come back more often now that I have sorted the password out - and wish you all very well!"},

She went off to school at 0645 Thursday morning to open the envelope - and it felt like the envelope held so much more than just a piece of paper with some letters on it! Turns out she's one bright girl - A* in Religious Studies, A in Geography and B in Politics.  She's blown the predictions out of the water and done so much better than she had even dared to hope. The place she was holding at Norwich would have been settled with lower grades, and now that she has the grades in the bag, so to speak, decisions have been made: she's going to reapply for autumn next year, and she can apply to more challenging universities this time around... because she knows what she has to offer.  So here we go again with some open day visits etc, but it'll be fun.......[I'm trying hard to convince myself of this, as this will be the third time!]The job she has already secured for the holidays is hers to continue after some discussion there yesterday, and she will look for more work to supplement that as it is only 15 hours a week.The EFG is here for another two weeks and then heads back northwards, I've some more dates booked with the chap from the Lakes, and lots of work to keep me busy. Life continues and we're all looking forward with anticipation - we're all September-lovers who rejoice in fresh beginnings in the autumn. There's a little chunk of me which is secretly quite chuffed to keep my baby at home for another year, but I do appreciate that it is only postponing the inevitable - but she will be saving hard, working hard and I hope enjoying herself as well in this intervening time.Much love to you all - and I hope that those of you with folk awaiting results or had results are doing OK too xx"},

We're halfway between Penrith and Carlisle, and the cottage is tucked away from the road in a wee courtyard.  The girls came up on Friday and I arrived on Sunday after the morning service had been delivered. I had a full day out with them and J [the FH's cousin's widow, whom we have brought with us] yesterday but the girls have gone to a wildlife park today whilst J and I are having a quieter day at home, so far, anyway!Yesterday we went to Wray Castle, but Hill Top was packed out so we gave that a miss. Huge scones were scoffed in Keswick, and we had a mooch in a few shops there too.  The weather was very pleasant and the driving, although very different from the Fens, was a lovely experience - everything from the M6 to one-track roads with passing places, where we had an incident with a Stagecoach bus! We survived though ;)I spent the evening with the chap - what a co-incidence that he lives only 9 miles from the cottage ;) We watched some athletics on the tv as he had taken his son to London to the Olympic Park last weekend to see some of the IAAF World Championships so there were heats that he had seen there that he wanted to see the relevant finals for - and it was tense for a couple of the races. We really thought Laura Muir might pull off the 1500 metres but she came in fourth, which seems heartbreaking but she did take it well.  The girls and I met his son the previous weekend and really enjoyed spending time with him: he seems like a very well-adjusted and lovely lad, very keen on being active and sporty, which might be a challenge for us, but he was witty and wry with it, and very realistic about some of the challenges of ministry - he has no fear in telling it like it is!Hoping to nip over the border into Scotland tomorrow, pottering around in Carlisle and perhaps the cinema on Thursday and then home again on Friday.  The Yeti's going well and I am very happy with it. It drinks slightly more diesel than the Fabia did but that is to be expected, so I am not complaining.Some challenges continue at work - we tried to appoint a Children's Worker to the circuit team but the candidates were not suitable, the Super's not terribly well, and the rest is in God's hands, as it always is. His constant presence upholds us in all that we do, and I am encouraged by looking back to see all the blessings in our lives, which then enable us to be stronger in our certainty that He will continue to support and bless us into the future. Quite what that future holds isn't as clear at this point, but I continue to appreciate your prayers and support.  The YFG's exam results are the next hurdle and we will be jumping that one next Thursday........"},

The last service was well attended and joyful, and it was the right thing to do.I've sprained my ankle and had some recovery time for that - good excuse to put my feet up for a couple of days. Still aching occasionally but wearing walking boots most of the time is supporting it and I'm doing everything normally again now.I've bought a new-to-me car.  I stuck with the Skoda brand but I've got a Yeti this time..... Quite a change for me, and the FH would be turning in his grave if he was in one [still in the sideboard] because he called 4x4s \"Chelsea tractors\" and thought they were an affectation but I love it!  I appreciate being a bit higher on the road and I love all the features, and just feeling that bit more secure.  The Yeti took me to Cumbria for the weekend to see my love, and it did very well. It was a joy to drive, but the roadworks on the A1 caused a lot of congestion so I came home through Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Rutland, and Nottinghamshire and did a lovely tour of the Midlands once I left the M6 at Jct 15. Pooley Bridge walk on Sunday after chapel at PenrithA brief excursion over the border to Gretna and Longtown Sunday eveningWe went to Ireby Festival on Saturday where Martyn Joseph was playing - it was brilliant to see him live.  They were handing out leaflets for other music festivals and we were given one for a festival in North Wales. I looked at it hard and wondered what had taken my eye, and then I realised it was in Trelawnyd Memorial Hall and I thought immediately of John Gray!It was a lovely weekend, but the Premier Inn where I stayed was looking a wee bit tired so I might look at an alternative for next time.  There is another one about a mile away......And the FH's beloved cousin has entered his last days now. His liver cancer has weakened him dramatically, and yesterday he had stopped responding at all when the carers moved him. He came home from hospital last Wednesday.  I shall have a funeral to do in June, I'm certain.  I promised him that I would do it for him, and we have it all planned so that he has peace about that. The EFG is home for the summer, and the YFG is beginning the battle with A levels, so lots of hard days ahead for her until the last one at the end of June. Much love to you all."},

I've got a service on Good Friday in the afternoon, but that's not such a big deal as I did one last year in a completely different area of the circuit so I am fairly hopeful that I can repeat it this year and no one who was there last year will be there to recognise the salient points. Just have to remember to borrow the wooden sword from my friend before she disappears off on holiday Thursday night.....Easter Sunday on the other hand, is getting complicated: baptism, sacrament and Easter in an hour.....could be a challenge.  I had a visit to the baptism family last week and had a wee hold of the baby - so cute - only born in January!  So out of practice at holding babies am I that I said to the mother that I really needed a cuddle to see how it felt again. He is adorable. Just pray for me that he doesn't wail too much....And the other question which occupies my thoughts at the moment.... what does one call a man who one is seeing at this age? \"Boy\"friend doesn't seem right.....suggestions welcome!  The YFG is amusing herself with her own suggestions which are not being taken too seriously. He was here for the day yesterday and we went for lunch with the girls and Grandad and MB: he passed muster, and since he shares Grandad and MB's love of football, they were well pleased with him. He had a tortuous journey home on the train but made it eventually, about three hours overdue.Today I have accompanied a lady to the CAB in order to help and support her in sorting out benefits, and it has been eye-opening, but well worthwhile for us both. We also had a hilarious time at a Knit and Natter session which was just after the meeting. She's becoming a part of the church family and they are taking her under their wings and looking out for her nicely.Wishing you all a very blessed Easter holiday season if I am not back again before then.

So I bought a sat nav, had the car thoroughly checked over, and sailed forth. And got there. I'd forgotten how much fun it is to charge up the A1!Then afterwards I had to stay in a B&B so that I could visit friends in Lincolnshire on Tuesday on the way home, and I realised that I had never stayed anywhere completely on  my own before either!  But that was fine too... We had a whole 9 hours together, the weather was fine and warm, and it was good to be together again. I'm enjoying this!!In other news, the EFG passed her driving test second time around on Wednesday [huge hip hip hooray] and the society ball of which she has been one of the main organisers is on tonight, and from the photos I have seen, it is a great success. Clever girl!  She's coming home on Monday for three weeks and I am really looking forward to catching up with her properly, instead of snatched conversations here and there.The FH's cousin who has liver cancer now has sepsis too, has been in hospital for a week but has now been discharged into a sort of \"hospice at home\" scenario, with a hospital bed in the sitting room, and carers. He is in his last days now, and very pleased to be spending them at home.  We saw him on Tuesday night, and will see him again next week once the EFG has arrived.I'm taking some time out from work this week - having a sort of \"reading week\" where people think I am not at work and so I don't attend things, but I am going to be doing a lot of stuff at home - there is a lot of admin stuff to catch up with, and internet setting up, and employment stuff to work on for the new people we want to advertise for, and I just can't do all of that when I am in the full swing of work. So I shall not work the 35 hours and I will definitely have some \"holiday\" but I shall be pottering about on the computer as well, and then taking more holiday later in the year.  I have plans to repaint my en-suite ceiling and interesting stuff like that....I have had an interesting conversation with the YFG this week about being money-saving in the midst of this new relationship which is demanding travel. She is keen that I do not become a spendthrift, partly because there would be less in the pot for her, I think ;) She was relieved that I could report to having socked away £500 this month, so I think I have put her fears to rest. For now. Until I tell her about the hotel room I have booked in Carlisle for the weekend at the end of May... but I have time to save for that between now and then!"},

We mooched around the Railway Museum, we pottered around in the Minster, we walked 7 miles altogether, enjoyed several cups of tea in various establishments, and a meal in a cosy little cafe, as well as a drink in a bar before the trains departed again. It was St Patrick's Day, of course, so the bars were busy in the evening and we poked our noses into a tent in the main street where there was an Irish Festival happening, and young girls were doing Irish dancing [which made me think of American friends with a passion for Irish dancing, CS!] and it was altogether a very good day.   Next week, we meet again in Yorkshire to go to a concert together, and then there is nothing yet in the diary until the end of May.  It's tricky - he works in ministry too, in another denomination, with a different day off......but as I reminded him yesterday, God's will finds a way, and if this is meant to work, it will.The lady I told you about in the last post died last Sunday morning. It was a blessed relief for her as she was suffering very badly and in a great deal of pain. You will be aware that I have been trusted with funerals for some time now.  I was so thrilled yesterday to be asked to take charge of a baptism on Easter Sunday at one of the churches where I have pastoral responsibility.  I had no idea that I could do a baptism, so that has come as a lovely bit of news: the child was due to be baptised next Sunday by the boss, but the child has come down with chickenpox so it is all to be postponed. The boss's diary and the family's did not align but they could make Easter Sunday when I will be there - so I shall be taking instructions most carefully at the next staff meeting!And now I must away to fight to find all the financial information which is required for my part of the girls' Student Finance England applications - deep joy!  But I have a new series of Vera on ITV tonight which I shall look forward to watching - I do love Northumberland and Brenda Blethyn."},
{"title": "Catching up ", "date": "Saturday 11 March 2017", "text": "Back into this space again.There's a family in the street where the Grandad was the FH's best pal, and I buried him in October. Grandad's daughter's husband's mother is dying now.......right now. The family are gathering, visiting her, coming close to share in the last hours. She is being kept pain free, and the medical team are doing wonders to support the family in the need to keep her at home, where she wants to be. She's scared, afraid of what will happen to her.  I'm popping in and out, supporting the rest of the family, doing what I can, and praying for them all. And then there's another family some miles away. The chap was another of the FH's best mates, his cousin, and he's slowly slipping away from us, as liver cancer weakens him. He has asked me to take his funeral, and we have prepared it together so that it is ready when the time comes. That has brought him peace. This lovely man is the YFG's godfather, and so she is significantly upset about it all, not only that he is suffering, but that she will lose another connection to her father.  That's hard for her.Work continues well for me.  I've been made a Lay Pastor with pastoral responsibility for two of the churches, which is very exciting, and I am really pleased with the opportunity.  Personally, today has been interesting......being in a developing relationship with a Scottish bloke who lives in Carlisle has been difficult when England has thrashed Scotland in the Six Nations today and an East Anglian team, Cambridge, have given Carlisle a beating in the footie....... Best not to talk about that, and move on!  We're having a day in York on Friday so looking forward to that.  Don't think we'll be talking about football and rugby ;)Sermon tomorrow is about risk taking, so I'm using the managers of Lincoln City as an illustration - giving up secure jobs in education to go and manage a football team takes quite a leap of faith. Would have been wonderful if Lincoln had managed to beat Arsenal today but I think that would have been expecting too much!Have a good weekend....."},

Apparently she executed an immaculate three point turn.The YFG has been out on her first solo drive - she went and did the grocery shopping yesterday morning whilst I was at work. She's on half term so she thought she would get that nerve wracking first trip over and done with. She's out in the village tonight at her best friend's house having a takeaway but I think she should be home soon.Thank you for continuing to read. Lovely to read all the comments on the last post."},
{"title": "February already!", "date": "Monday 6 February 2017", "text": "Jackie has given me a nudge to come back to this space this morning, so I am here to say \"Hello, and wow, where did January go?!\"We're up to our eyes in work, revision for mocks for A levels, and driving tests for both girls this week in Peterborough (YFG) and Aberdeen (EFG) - I am just hoping that they both get the same result, whatever it is, as the tension will be huge if one passes and one fails!I am buying the odd bunch of daffs to cheer the desk and remind me that Spring is on its way, but on dark and cold mornings when I struggle to get out of bed, it still seems a while away - but the occasional glimpse of the sun gives me hope!This morning, I am waiting for a grocery shop to be delivered, then I am off to work later in the morning.  We are asked to only work two sessions a day, so it is the afternoon and evening for me today.  It is a sensible rule, but one to which I struggle to adhere some weeks - when I have to attend meetings which are arranged by others, I have to go whenever they are, and that makes the diary a challenge occasionally.  We get round this by counting the days we work three sessions and then having an extra day off now and again when they have mounted up.....the trouble was that when I counted the days in January and looked for a day I could take off - and the soonest one I could find free was mid March.  I have got leave booked more regularly so I am not being worked too hard.The role continues to change and be developed - the latest incarnation of it to be suggested is that I take pastoral charge of two of the churches in the circuit. Discussions have been had and it will be brought to the circuit meeting for decisions on 1st March; it is an exciting development and I shall be thrilled if it is accepted, as they are two congregations of which I am particularly fond, and it will mean working more closely with both of them.It's also been a season of reconnecting - I've picked up a couple of new \"friends\" from Facebook, who actually were not new but very old!  A friend from uni appeared in my Facebook feed as he had been involved in a partnership between with the Church of Scotland and the Methodist church, so I sent a quick message to say how delighted I was to see the two denominations working together and to send a word of encouragement - and now the emails have been flying between north and south as we catch up on the twenty two years since St Andrews!  It has also been great to share news of other fellow students as he has kept up with different ones from those with which I have been in contact. I'm very much enjoying and being challenged by Ann Voskamp's \"The Broken Way\" book and study online and would recommend them hugely to those of you interested in a little introspection and personal growth. As her book on gratitude impacted on me so much, I think that this one will also be life-changing but in a different way. Better go - shopping has just arrived!  Love to you all and thanks for your patience!!"},

{"title": "Advent", "date": "Tuesday 13 December 2016", "text": "Here I sit, with twinkling lights decorating the windowsill, folk going past in the their cars taking the kids to school, the news on the tv in the background and thinking about getting ready to go off to work in under an hour. I realised last night that I haven't been here for about six weeks, and I was overdue for a catch-up.  If you are still reading, even with my long absences, I thank you.Gratitude has long been part of my life now and I started an Advent theme on my Facebook posts with that idea at its heart. Each day I am posting a few words about things for which I am grateful that day. In all the hustle and busy-ness of getting ready for Christmas, I wanted to stop and be content with what I have now, rather than always looking forward to what will come in the future.  Anticipation is good, but so is contentment in the now.Angels have been a huge part of my life in the last month - we have \"Angels and anticipation\" as our Advent theme for church and circuit life this year, so we have had Angel festivals, angel plays, angel Messy Churches - I am just about done with angels for one year, and we are joking that our theme next year will be \"Silent Night\" so that we can be quiet and reflective instead.Only five more sleeps and then the EFG will be home from Aberdeen for Christmas. She has another exam tomorrow and then some socialising before she comes home on Saturday - can't wait!  Really looking forward to having her here for three weeks. I hope you are all keeping well, and life continues peacefully.  I shall get round to reading more blogs sometime soon, but not this week!  Someone jokingly said that I would get a rest soon, but I can't see one coming until after Christmas lunch - but I shall be ready for it by then.  There are troubles in the circuit and lots of work to be done even in the New Year so we need to have a break and recharge our batteries over the Christmas holiday.  The boss is taking the workers to Norwich to see Mamma Mia in February so we are looking forward to that immensely as our staff day out!Much love, as always x"},
{"title": "A good day for a catch up", "date": "Tuesday 1 November 2016", "text": "All Saints' Day was the patronal festival of the church in which I grew up, so it does mean something to me for that reason, if no other. It's hard to sort all these saints out, and sometimes easier just to think of them all! This past month has been a challenging one.......the YFG has been to Aberdeen to have a look at the geography department, and loved the uni, but thought it would only be ideal if it were closer to home. It's on her list, but UEA at Norwich is looking as if it might be the favourite.  She went there for a Geography Summer School in July and got on really well, so hopefully she might score a place there.The EFG came home for the weekend and just went back yesterday - we had lunch with Grandypops whilst she was here, and we generally had a good weekend together.  She's doing well, and has to keep her nose to the grindstone for another 7 weeks now until the Christmas break.The FH's best mate died at the end of the week before last, and we have his funeral this week.  He was an amazing old gentleman, who lived almost 86 years but his last days were spent at home, as he wanted, in the busy household with his daughter and her family. I have had the privilege of supporting them through this time, and taking the funeral.  He and the FH went on all sorts of adventures together, and we are sure that they are together again now.The FH's son has been and FINALLY taken the FH's old banger of a car away!  That feels like a major achievement in life, and the old car is no longer cluttering up the gravel driveway at the back of the house. Next step is to get a skip in and clear out some more rubbish.......whether he will ever clear out the tools and machinery that the FH left him from the workshop is another matter...Financially, as we approach the end of the year, I am relieved to see from the charts that we are just over £2000 up in addition to the new-to-us car which I bought in March, so doing very well at saving again this year.  Frugality has its moments, and we are looking ahead to the time next August when the bereaved parents' allowance, the child benefit and the tax credits all end as the YFG will turn 18, and making sure that everything is doable within the income that we will have left, so we are saving as much as we can now, not only as a cushion for then, but also to prove to ourselves that we can live on less.  The YFG will have much less than the EFG in terms of income, as Aberdeen has a very generous financial package for low-income English families, which the YFG will not get elsewhere.Keeping our priorities in order is a significant part of that - the post has just arrived with a £22 text book which the YFG needs, so that has been put in her room, but the Boden catalogue which arrived at the same time has gone straight in the bin.We have also reclaimed the dining room as a usable room in the house - the girls are thrilled and I am looking forward to Christmas lunch in there this year. I hope that you are all well - I do have a nosey around your blogs occasionally when I sit down for a cuppa.  Toodle pip for now though x"},
{"title": "Another day", "date": "Thursday 13 October 2016", "text": "The blog roll hasn't reappeared yet, so if anyone does know how to get it back, I would be very pleased to hear from you.......In other news, the EFG has sacked one driving instructor in Aberdeen who was incredibly rude and unhelpful, but has found another, who comes highly recommended.  Good sign - he also has a waiting list, but she got onto that before she sacked the woman she is leaving.  She had had to pay the woman for a block booking in advance, so she has lost about £10 for the last little bit of time she has not claimed, but she is not worried about that - far better to be clear of such a negative personality, she feels.Continuing with the roads, the YFG has passed her theory test in the last couple of hours and is on her way home from the library where she took the test, and we will shortly be off to see my dad.He's had a health scare and is a bit fragile. It was his 87th birthday on Monday, so we suddenly became conscious that we hadn't seen him since the EFG was at home, and thought it was time we made the short journey across the Fens to see him - but then quite by chance, the YFG's driving instructor took her to his town yesterday on quite a route. Unfortunately, they did not stop in to see him but he would have been thrilled to have seen her behind the wheel!Work? Manic. Too many hours last week......  Love it though, and the people!

{"title": "Phew!", "date": "Wednesday 21 September 2016", "text": "It seems that life is just keeping me away from blogging at the moment. I have really appreciated the support that this blogging community has given to me over the last few years, and whilst I am not closing this blog down, I am coming to the conclusion that aiming to post regularly is just not going to happen. Each day is split into three sections and I am only supposed to work two of them each day, but at the moment, that's rare. It's not killing me, though, because when I have a late night out at a meeting, I tend to have a morning the next day when I can have a later start. There are days when I am out and about all day, but others where I maybe just have to pop somewhere for an hour, or I can just work at home on paperwork for most of the day. It does balance out in the end, but what with the house, spending time with the YFG and on the phone with the EFG, visiting my dad occasionally and just attempting to keep up with friends, I'm not spending time on blogs now.  Have to say that I do miss your news, though.I have launched a new choir in one of our town churches, and we are meeting each week - we kicked off with nine members on the first night - and we were thrilled to be able to sing a Joseph song by the end of it - given that it is a choir to enable people who \"can't\" sing to benefit from the health aspects of singing, we were chuffed with ourselves!Our bereavement support group in one of the other smaller churches is also working out very well as we have had a couple of new people coming along in the last couple of months. There are two sisters attending who have both been widowed in the last 18 months, and they have just had another blow in that their third sister has just died after a long struggle with cancer.  We are spending time in prayer for them all.We are looking forward to seeing UJ today - it was his birthday yesterday and the YFG has made him a beautiful chocolate cake for tea today.  I am also going to be doing some baking for a local MacMillan coffee morning this Friday, so the mixer is busy this week - ginger cake has been requested. The EFG has settled very well back into Aberdonian life - she loves the situation in the new flat. There are four of them in the flat, although there are five rooms, but one hasn't been let. One of the other girls never actually sleeps in the flat, so most of the time there is only the EFG and two others there - so quite relaxed and calm. They are having weekly Sunday or Monday meals together and she is getting on with the other girls very well: the two she is spending most time with are both doing primary education, but all of them have their own groups of friends and do not depend on one another for friendship, which is rather more healthy than the last flat group which was heavily dependent on one another - and made life uncomfortable when they fell out.September has been as cost-effective as I could make it - but I had to go and buy some new boots yesterday: as I have said before, my winter boots are 11 [black pair] and at least 16 [brown] years old. The black pair sprung a leak and I had wet feet on Monday.....I wear black a lot of the time, so it was time to get some more. I went into Clarks and asked the lady for all the plain black boots they had in size 8 to try on - and she brought out three pairs. I bought two of them!  I thought that I had definitely had my money's worth out of the others, since the 11 year old pair cost me £50 and I have worn them so much!I have kicked off the school governor year by announcing that this is my last year and that I WILL definitely be retiring at the end of the year - and we have further put plans in place to designate the next chair in January so that I can spend 6 months handing over to the new chair before I retire. I am thrilled with the school and the way it has moved forward and developed over my time as a governor, and it is time to let go and move on now.  It will be one less responsibility too!Enough for this morning - need to go and get the day moving!"},
{"title": "And we're off with the challenge!", "date": "Friday 2 September 2016", "text": "We were severely limited with financial challenges when the EF girls were here last year, and so spending was at a level which we could sustain, but not a lot was saved, if you see what I mean. Now that the September 1st has arrived and I feel like a new beginning again - and it is the start of the school and Methodist Connexional years - so here we go again!Why? Because we have a big bill coming in from March when the chimney was fixed, because the girls want to be insured to drive when they have had more lessons, because there is more work on the house that I want to do, including replacing a shower unit and some decorating, because we need to save up for some new carpets! I have to make a contribution for fuel to the cousin who is taking the EFG back to Aberdeen.  And I want to do all of those projects this year, before the income drops as I mentioned in the last post......So for this month - we are doing back to back weekly spending challenges where we only buy what we absolutely need, and I reckon we can manage on about £25 a week for the two of us. That is for FOOD only. Hopefully we might spend a bit less.......we'll see. We kicked off yesterday with a no-spend day so we still have £25 in the pot for this week."},
{"title": "Waving goodbye", "date": "Wednesday 31 August 2016", "text": "I shall be seeing the EFG off on the train this morning as she makes her way to Leicester for a conference, from which she will head to Aberdeen for the next term and the beginning of her third year.  She will be coming back from Leicester to Peterborough, where cousins live, and I shall meet her there on Friday with her luggage; a cousin is taking her back to Aberdeen from Peterborough, and they are leaving at about 6am on Saturday, so it makes sense for her to stay with them on Friday night and make their departure on Saturday as smooth as possible.  We hope that her third year at Aberdeen will be good, and a little less stressful now that she has new flatmates who are hopefully a little more balanced than one of the ones she had last year who was rather volatile. I can't believe that she is 20 years old now and half way through her degree.......makes me feel old!She's been here since mid-May and we have again to get used to being without her - but we are getting more practised at it now, so it should be OK!  We haven't got the foreign girls this year, so it is going to be quiet here, but the YFG will have to knuckle down and work hard in her A level year, and I have gone from 20 to 30 hours at work since last September, so we are both going to be busy and well occupied! The YFG has a pediatric first aid course to do this term, which will complement her gymnastics qualification, and she also has to do the actual Duke of Edinburgh expedition in September.  I'm hoping the decent weather continues for them as I think they are heading to the Lake District....A new financial challenge starts here tomorrow on the 1st September, so we are also looking forward to getting started on that - we have had so many financial drains this summer that we really need to boost the coffers. The EFG will turn 18 next summer and all our bereaved parent and family-related benefits will cease [as they should: I am not complaining] but there is a real chance that she will stay at home and take on more study or an apprenticeship and so I will continue to support her financially without those benefits, so we are already looking at living on that amount. God continues to bless us and provide all that we need, but we do have to be good stewards of that provision, and we are looking at what we really need and what we choose to buy sometimes that might not really be necessary."},

It was hot!Since getting home this afternoon, the YFG and I have had a clear out of one of the freezers, since it is rubbish day tomorrow - we have thrown away food which we realistically know we are never going to eat - and I found ratatouille dated 2006.......so past time it was moved on!  I hate to throw stuff out but sometimes, it is the only thing.  We run three freezers, and came to the conclusion this weekend that we should be reducing that down by at least one, so we have probably cleared out enough room in the largest one to move the contents of another smaller one over - but I am not doing that until the next bin day as there will surely be stuff  in the smaller one that we decide to discard as well!I've also been cleaning some windows and doing some washing. Too much activity for one day - I am off to have a shower and read a book now.  Hope you are all well and I am trying to keep up with my favourite blogs, so if I haven't commented for a while, sorry, but I am still reading a few times a week xx"},

It was GCSEs and then AS levels and A levels for the EFG, and then the GCSEs and now the AS levels for the YFG. One more year to go!So we went with some trepidation this morning. We knew that the Geography hadn't been brilliantly taught in one half of the course, and we were all too aware that a good chunk of the Politics hadn't been taught at all.....so I was hugely thrilled at the result. The YFG is so disappointed with the E for Politics that we have to keep reminding her that the A for Geography is a small miracle and the B for Religious Studies is very very good. She worked so very hard for those results that I am one very proud mummy tonight.  She does mention often that no one in the family has ever got an E before - we reply that no one has ever tried Politics before.....she joked to her big brother that at least she knows she can rule out Politics as a career now! She will do those papers for Politics again next year when she does the A level papers, and hope for a better outcome. A new teacher has been appointed so we can hope that he will be more effective.All in all - a good outcome, and far better than I had hoped.

We're third in the medal table tonight and although I have no idea how long that will last, it is pretty special to see it for now! We were very briefly second, but that didn't last too long....."},

They went back to the boat for lunch and then spent time in the pool in the afternoon.I think that this is the view of the town from the boat........We had a hitch with the YFG's phone yesterday with the Tesco Rocket pack SIM not working so it meant I had to nip to Tesco here to get it sorted out.  I am waiting to hear from the girls today to see whether the problem is rectified.  My dad seems to be coping with the jaunt OK but is not going ashore and is enjoying time relaxing on his balcony........snoozing a bit I think!"},
{"title": "Chinwagging", "date": "Tuesday 9 August 2016", "text": "The YFG is the kingpin of a relationship we have with another family in the village - she and their daughter are very good friends, I get on well with the mum and dad, and they have a son who used to come to the gymnastics club when I was coaching, and he is a lovely lad.  I don't get to see that much of them nowadays, as the couple are both working, as am I, and so the relationship really relies on the girls to hold it together. I did give the lad the opportunity to earn a few quid last weekend by painting the shed, which he did with some relish.So that has set the scene for a conversation which the YFG reported at the weekend. She had gone to see the daughter and taken them a few veggies from the garden, and stayed for a chat. The chinwag got around to a wedding that they had attended and the mum then blew the YFG out of the water in a way by saying, \"I don't suppose your mum will get married again, will she? She's very happy on her own........\"She couldn't have been more wrong, and the YFG knew it, but she also recognised that it may be too soon for the folks around here to know that, so she hummed and hahhed and avoided actually saying too much, apart from noting that I am only 43, so anything is possible!  I think I have said before that the YFG has keen ideas about me being at least attached loosely to someone else by the time she goes off to university, but given that that could be in a year's time, we won't worry too much about that time frame. Let's just say that I don't want to be on my own for ever!  And whilst I am not \"happy\" at being on my own [there are lots of challenges to being a single parent], please don't think that I am miserable or depressed or particularly sad about it. God's got it all in hand, I am sure.What upset the both of us was the presumption that this lady could have an opinion about something like this, something so personal and so private in many ways, and then that she would vocalise her thoughts to my daughter, of all people? She has never had a conversation with me about how I feel and has nothing to base her opinion upon, so she really doesn't have a clue! But that is the world that we live in these days!  Everyone seems to think that they have the right to have opinions about other people's lives, and that it is OK to share them.  I blame too much celebrity washing of dirty linen on the tv and it is rubbing off on the rest of us."},

They will be on Ventura, heading for Spain and Portugal [well, one port in Spain, two in Portugal and then Guernsey on the way home] and the suitcases and the packing have taken over the house these last few days!  I'm a tiny bit sad that the YFG will be away from me for her birthday at the weekend, but she's looking forward to celebrating on board.So I am up for a quiet week. I feel kind of reflective today anyway, as I spent a lot of time yesterday praying for a friend's father to die peacefully. He had had a stroke on Saturday and he had little hope of recovering, so the family were hoping for a painless and peaceful passing for him, without suffering. His wife had already died a number of years ago, and he had been wanting to go to be with her for some time. He died in his sleep just after 3pm.Thanks for stopping by - I'll see you again soon!"},

It is that time of year when people are afraid to answer their door to me in case I am offering more courgettes - my courgette recipe folder is out and being well used!  The French beans are also laden with gorgeous green beans and the tomatoes in the greenhouse are ripening nicely. The girls are off on their holidays with Grandypops a week on Monday, and so the preparations are beginning in earnest now......the cases, the shopping, the washing, the choosing....the slight panic!  They are getting a little excited now that the time is drawing nearer.  Dad's health isn't great and he will be getting another MOT at the doctor's next Friday to ensure that the doctor is happy that he is fit to go. Fingers crossed as he really loves his cruises and finds them so relaxing. I doubt he will get off the boat at all this time.My hours at work are set to increase again, possibly in September, so I will be as good as full time.

She has admitted that the foreign girls were good company, so I think she will find that it takes a little getting used to; the year before the girls came, I was working the phone job and so I was here most of the time for her when she was out of school.  Mmmm. We'll have to see how that one goes in September: the EFG has her date set for her return, and her journey is all planned now. Hope you are all doing well - I do keep an eye on most of the blogs when I stop for a cuppa now and again!  Love to you all xx"},

And today - it has been more of an indoorsy kind of day, hiding from the heat as much as we could, and just popping out as much as necessary. I've pottered in the garden tonight, watering the tomatoes, beans and courgettes so that they live through this heat.I'm not particularly looking forward to going to bed tonight, as it seems that the overnight temperatures are likely to remain above 20 degrees.......and that is going to make for uncomfortable conditions. One of the neighbours has recommended opening the loft hatch and letting heat escape that way - but the girls thought that the number of spiders which would make their way down would outweigh the benefits, so we didn't try that.Another chilled drink and another cool shower are in order before I try to get to sleep, I think.  At least we are not taxing the hot water system this week!"},

She did load up with some porridge before she left, but the more calories she can take on board before they start, the better, I think: she doesn't have an awful lot of food in the pack for the four days, and I am sure she will have lost weight when she gets back!The weather is playing havoc with me keeping the weeds under control in the garden and I have given up!  All I am doing now is managing to keep the grass to a reasonable level......UJ has been away to the coast with my sister for a week, and we are looking forward to seeing him tomorrow and catching up with his news.The EFG helped collect donations at a Food bank drive in Tesco last week, and I worked the same thing in a different Tesco last Saturday morning - I am relieved to be able to say that both received very generous donations, and people were generally very supportive.My dad has had to have a chest x-ray. He's not doing brilliantly. We have to wait until he sees the doctor on Friday to get the results, but I am hoping that the doctor will advise him about the wisdom of the August cruise, as I really don't want them to go if he is not well enough.Work is going well, and I am still enjoying it........which is good!!  I am getting fed up of people telling me how tired I look, though, so I have had to invest in some proper make-up. Getting up at 4.30am this morning will not help matters, but I shall have an early night tonight. I am NOT tired!Much love to all of you who keep reading, now that posting is more sporadic.

She didn't like the city itself: apologies to any Glaswegian readers but her overall impression of the city was that \"everyone smokes and it stinks\" but she did love the Kelvingrove museum - she is a big museum fan!They gathered themselves yesterday and returned to the normal routine of school today - the YFG as the student and the EFG in the Teaching Assistant role she is trying out.And me? I've got a whole week off work!I'm going to spend it well - interviewing potential teachers for school today, governors meeting tomorrow, course on Thursday, pootling about in the garden [if it ever stops raining] and sorting the house out post-EF so that rooms vaguely return to how they once were......might be a big job!  Some sock knitting or crochet might also be on the cards, but I am not holding my breath.

The news last night was that they had walked over 22000 steps, had a wander by Kelvingrove and round a museum or two. Today I hope they don't go mad in the shops......They weren't terribly impressed with the view from their hotel room window.Tomorrow morning they will be up at the crack of dawn to catch a train just after 7am to get to Stirling to go to the open day there. After that, they are coming home - and I will be very glad to have them home again - it's getting a bit quiet here on my own.Hopefully they will take some photos to show me where they have been and what they think - it is years since I was in either Glasgow or Stirling!"},

{"title": "Scaring folks", "date": "Wednesday 15 June 2016", "text": "The EFG did her stint at the Foodbank on Tuesday. She arrived at 9.30 for her session until 11.30 but by 10.30, everything was done that needed to be done. She has chatted with the other volunteers and apparently, this is happening more often these days. Why? Because they are just not getting the volume of donations that they usually get, so it takes far less time to sort and stack what they do get.The consensus of opinion between the volunteers is that the EU referendum is scaring people, and so they are not donating in case they need their cash/stash of food themselves because of all the headlines in the news about what might happen either way. Their amateur philosophy is that if we leave the EU, the donations will fall even further as people worry about what might happen. They are worried, though, that even if the vote is to stay, the donations will not resume at the rate that is required to have adequate stocks on the shelves, because of the uncertainty about the way that the EU will develop.They are still feeding people, but they don't have the resilience in the back room stock that they had a couple of months ago [well, they have plenty of baked beans at her particular Foodbank, but not a lot of anything else] and the donations boxes in the supermarkets around here are not filling up the way they did, she says.I preached on gratitude this last Sunday [one of my favourite topics] and one of my points is that we should rely on God each and every day, and give thanks for all that he gives us on a daily basis. I try to remember that whether or not we are in the EU, people still need to be fed when they are hungry.  I am not into politics in a big way, and I just have my own little opinion, but even I can see that there is a lot of scaremongering going on on both sides, and it is hard to watch the damage it is doing."},

The Austrian walked off down the platform when I dropped her at the station after we shared a hug, and she was gone.  A very independent girl, she seems to concentrate on looking forward to the next adventure.The Dane was a different departure all together. We went out for a meal on Saturday night and had a lovely time. We came home and continued to try to finish her Downton marathon, before giving up and all heading to bed around 11.30pm. Sunday morning we watched a bit more, squeezed her suitcase closed, and things started to get a bit too real for her.  By the time we got to the appointed bus station, the tears and jitters had begun, and we had to have a lot of hugs. As she said, she came over here and built a new life for 10 months, and now she has to walk away from everything here and get back to normal in Denmark.  Bless her!  She's had a night at an EF camp for the farewell prom and will fly home today.  We've had a couple of exchanges on Facebook messenger this morning and she's OK so far.  My girls have already noted that it is quieter here without her.And the farewells will go on - my two are off to Glasgow and Stirling from Wednesday till Saturday so that the EFG can chaperone the YFG around the two uni open days up there.

{"title": "All kinds of grief", "date": "Friday 10 June 2016", "text": "I've been doing a lot of work on the bereavement project lately in my role in the church and it has been both eye-opening and challenging.  We have set up a Bereavement Support Group in one of the churches, and it meets monthly. We had two widows the first month and four in the second meeting. I have heard all sorts of comments and sayings just lately: \"of course you are crying, dear: if you didn't cry, it would be as if you didn't love him.....\" was just one of them.  It makes me wonder what folk must think about me, not having shed a tear in public, and not a great deal in private either. I went on a course provided by Care for the Family, which was excellent, and incredibly informative. I have come across plenty of websites and blogs written to support and encourage people who have lost their partners. I am also looking at a stack of books on the same topic.  I'm a bit inundated!  Then yesterday I went to a chat with some women from another church who are promoting information about dying well. So I am working both sides of the event now.(image from awarenessdays.co.uk)I have read a really good article tonight about all kinds of grieving not being the same. When I look back over my life, I have lost both grandmothers and a grandfather, a couple of aunts, my mother and now my husband. I've experienced the death of my best friend's brother from suicide, as well as the death of a dearly beloved colleague's son, also from suicide but by another method.  I've seen people grieve and I have done it myself. Every single relationship brings on a different kind of grief. For me, grandparents' deaths were not as traumatic: they were all over 80 and two were actually over 90 when they died, and so they had achieved the age where younger children are not so shocked to hear of their deaths. I was sad that they had indeed died, but to a young child, as I was when my dad's parents passed on, they were relatively remote characters and I did not feel it as hard as my other grandmother, who died in 2002, four years after her daughter, my mother.  Of all the deaths, my mother's was the worst. We knew she had cancer, but the death itself came very quickly in the space of 8 hours. I grieved terribly and agonisingly for nearly two years, had to have anti-depressants and therapy, and it was a huge loss.The ladies at the Bereavement Support Group were talking, as we hoped that they would, and one was sharing that the doctor had wanted to put in a support package for her in order to help her to look after her terminally ill husband. She had refused it and said that she wanted to do everything herself. She was a bit shocked when I said that I was willing to accept all the help there was, partly because I was also thinking about the girls. She had expected me to agree with her, and was a bit shocked that I didn't.  But then she has other ideas about her own grief, too, and doesn't expect to really enjoy life any longer now that her life partner has gone.Oh, how challenged this society is by death.  (image from wecandiebetter.com)I am finding that people don't want to talk about death, unless they are affected in some way by it, but then even those who have close knowledge of it will expect that other's experience will be similar if not the same.It can never be the same. Each one of us has a different life experience, different backgrounds, different relationships with our deceased beloved [and in some cases, not beloved] and we come from different death experiences - why on earth would anyone expect grief to affect us all in the same way?"},
{"title": "Do you get it?", "date": "Thursday 9 June 2016", "text": "I've noticed a new-to-me expression coming out in local speech more and more lately. At first there was only one person, and I thought it was a peculiarity of hers, but then I came across it more and more.  The conversation would run something like this, \"Are you coming to the party on Saturday?\" The other person would think for a minute and then reply, \"Well, no. I was coming with Susie but she can't get.\" And I am left wondering what it is that Susie can't get!  The sentence demands that there is an object attached to that verb, surely?  You are probably quicker on the uptake than I was the first time, and realise that they mean that Susie can't come, can't get THERE, or here or wherever.  Is that just a local thing here, or even an East Anglian phenomenon, or is it happening all over the place?  We are not far from the border with Norfolk and have a lot of people in our communities who speak with a slight Norfolk accent, which I love. It has all sorts of interesting words in the local speech, which make it unique.  There's \"int\" which loosely translates as \"isn't it\" but not always....and \"noo\" instead of \"new\" which is how my mother used to pronounce it too. We also hear \"moosick\" and the Bernard Matthews [he of the turkey fame] favourite, \"bootiful\".  It's lovely to listen to, but it does not help the children learning to spell at the school!"},

The portfolio that I have to produce requires me to write reflections on a course of study in which I have participated for over 15 hours. If at HE/FE level, it can be within the last 5 years, but at any other level, it must be within the last three years. Mmmm - that means I have to go on a course PDQ in order to be able to write about one! Trouble is, the average \"course\" that I go on is for the day or a couple of hours, so I haven't been on a course of the required length for years, let alone in the last three years, with all that we have had going on here.  It is also a bit late to start an evening course now, as they all started for this term after Easter, and there is also a limited number of that sort of course available around here. This one is going to be a challenge!And then I have to shadow a minister for 20 hours, which seems OK. BUT it has to be in a circuit much different from ours here - which pretty much means it will have to be a city circuit. Heading into Cambridge or Peterborough is going to be the only option there, I think. I had been offered rural north Lincolnshire, but I think that setting will be too similar to our own, unfortunately.Boss lady has suggested that we start the process this year, but don't have it all ready for December this year, but aim for December 2017 which would take me for training from September 2018. True, it would give me more time, and perhaps that is the right approach.

The Austrian leaves on Wednesday for two weeks at home, then she'll be back for ten days before she actually leaves for good. The Dane is here till the 12th June but her exams will be over this week so she is planning some down time and excursions, as well as a spot of shopping as she has found UK prices to be more favourable than Danish ones!Work is exciting, and I am working with an amazing team of folk whom I love to bits, and we are having a great time together, as well as facing up to some incredible challenges in the circuit......but God is good, as the boss keeps saying, and we had a fantastic circuit service yesterday with over 90 people coming together from most of the chapels to worship together - and the roof was loosened a little, even if it didn't come off altogether!I spent Saturday at a conference about bereavement support, which was so interesting and informative, but I have to read all the course notes again and get it all into my head. There was so much to take in but I met some lovely people, and I will be able to keep in touch with some of them in the future.  I didn't have to travel too far to the conference, either, which was a bonus, as it was held at a church in Peterborough - the church is disguised as a conference centre and used for that as well, as it is modern and purpose built, and the conferences during the week must be a valuable income stream for the church too. The raspberries are rampaging across the garden, the lawns have all been cut today, and there are seedlings coming through the veg beds now, as well as tomatoes in the greenhouse - UJ has been a bit busy and I keep it going from week to week, but couldn't do it without him!The information and forms about candidating for ministry come out on the Methodist website in about two weeks and I am simultaneously scared and excited about the whole process and what I have to do.......I know I have some wonderful support here though so I am sure I will get through it if it is God's plan for me.

I committed to walking that many steps each day, including today, so I am hoping to get the walking done before Storm Katie hits us - she had better hold off until tomorrow.I have actually already walked the 70,000 steps necessary but since I said I would do it each day, I will - I have a choice, but the girls who walk for water have not the same luxury of choice and so I will walk today in their honour.  This cause is important to me, as someone who has received a good education and who works to promote equal opportunities and good education for the village children here, and I want all children to have access to education too.I've had a good level of support and think that I will have raised just over £200 by the time all the money so far pledged is in, so I am pleased with that as the original target was half of that.Each day I have been walking with some music to keep me company but yesterday I finally managed to get someone to come with me - the YFG accompanied me because I was lucky enough to borrow our friends' dog!  That was encouragement enough to get her to tag along, but whether I shall be so lucky today will be another matter!I'm taking the village chapel service this morning at 10am, UJ is here for a roast lamb lunch, and then I shall be walking in the afternoon before I go to help out at another service this evening.  And tomorrow - my feet will be up and I have a film to watch whilst the wind howls down the chimney.Happy Easter!"},

She may actually be terminal......  We bought her back in 2012 from a friend, and she has been doing incredibly well for an older car - she has now achieved over 172, 000 miles, and was going very well last Thursday.  Friday morning, she sounded like she was sickening for something and was very reluctant to get going in the morning [know how she feels!] so I went straight to the garage we always use in the village. Chap agreed that she didn't sound right but couldn't fit her in until Monday.I did ask what he thought about me going to the city to take the YFG to physio and he didn't recommend it, so I had to cancel that appointment. When I left the garage, I pottered slowly to the chapel where I parked her on the road outside and then went over the road to the school for a meeting.  Meeting over, worship lunch at the chapel done, and it was time to head home.  She really didn't want to start that time, so after a couple of attempts, I left her there and walked home, leaving the key with the chap at the garage on the way past, and asking him to recover her.Long story shortened, I called in there today to see how it was progressing and it isn't!  We have ordered a part from ebay to see if it is the problem, because he really isn't sure and it isn't worth buying the part new at £175 if it may not be that. Since the value of the car is likely to be only a couple of hundred at most, it really isn't worth taking her in to a Skoda main dealer and having them spend hours of expensive labour on her.  The part will be at Argos on Wednesday so I can pick it up then and we can see if she feels better after that has been fitted.

It is a bit tricky as these things go as there are no proposed questions or lines of thought to follow, but just four or five reflective pieces of writing, some prose and some poetic, to use as conversation starters.  Today's theme has been \"uncertainty\".I attend each week's group in three separate places as we seek to try to bring the opportunity to as wide as possible an audience across the area that we cover.  10am in the north, 2pm in the middle and then the evening session is out to the west.  An hour at each one, and about 75 miles done over the day - and each time, I listen and hear something slightly different.I struggle immensely with having to discuss something which I cannot see, but have only heard read aloud once, so by the third session, I am beginning to have coherent thoughts; it means that I do understand some of the comments of the others attending that this is a difficult course.  I shall have to give some feedback to the leadership team tomorrow when we have a chat. I shall talk more about this theme of Uncertainty another day when I have thought about it more, as it is all very fresh in my mind today and I am not sure I would be very coherent if I tried to explain my thoughts tonight!"},

Things happen quite differently in Denmark in that she was cremated on Monday [Monday! the day after she died - that would be impossible here as the queues for appointments at the crematoria seem to stretch into weeks in some places] and her thanksgiving memorial service is today. The ashes are likely to be interred today as well, she thinks.Parents' evening at school tonight so I will be dashing between three sets of teachers for them all, and hoping for good reports.  I expect good reports, as if there had been any problems, it would have been wise for the teachers to have told me before now!It is daffodil season in the Fens now - in full swing - and there are glorious spots of bright yellow everywhere!  It is lovely."},

It is bubbling away in the back of my mind, and there are people with whom I have been chatting, websites and books being read, prayers prayed, and God's intentions discerned, we hope.I have had a really exciting meeting with a widow from another church today - a joint friend set us up and she came over to have lunch with me, although it was our first meeting.  She is lovely and I really feel that we are going to be good friends - there is a bond between widows anyway, I feel, but I felt that we got on well today.  She has an inspiring vision for a ministry for widows on the internet and in local work too, and I would love to join with her and help her to make it happen - with a lot of prayer and careful consideration too.  I've got to talk with the folk at the church here too, but I think it might complement what we are doing here.....and there is room for both.So, widows out there who read, thank you for those of you who contacted me in the past, and I hope you won't mind if I get in touch with you again, and ask you a few more questions about your experiences. And those of you who are new here, but who might be widows too, would you like to email me, on the email address on the top right there, and share your thoughts - I'd love to know what has helped you in your experience, what you think might have been done better or differently, and any ideas you might have to share...it all stays confidential and nothing gets published anywhere, or publicly discussed.  It just helps me to understand the wealth of wisdom that we have as widows, and the way that we are being supported, or not, and who/which organisations are giving the most helpful support.As my new friend and I shared today, no one understands a widow as well as another one, and yet every one of us has a slightly different experience, and they are all to be valued, respected and held in a safe space.Thank goodness times have changed since the days in which we would have been expected to wear clothing like this - but time hasn't made death much easier to talk about in general society. (image from dailymail.co.uk)\"If you are a widow, know that this is a space for you and that there are those here who understand something [not everything] of how things can be.  We have dealt with the undertakers, made it through the funeral, waded through the paperwork and benefit claims, comforted the children, and started to find a new and different way forward.  Learning to cook for fewer people, having to find out about new responsibilities, getting used to being single again; none of it is easy, and there are some wise women who comment and support one another here. This is a space in which women hold one another up rather than beat one another up, who support and encourage rather than compete and challenge, and who bless one another with patience and peace.\"And that is what I want to work towards creating.  What do you think?"},

{"title": "Durability", "date": "Tuesday 23 February 2016", "text": "The EFG sent me a link to a website last week, and then the same website popped up in my Facebook newsfeed yesterday - and I think it is worth sharing.A woman called Tara Button has set up an online shop called \"Buy Me Once\" in which it is possible to purchase items which are guaranteed to last a lifetime - or they will be replaced by the company which makes them. Brands such as Le Creuset for cook ware and Doc Martens are there, and lots more.  (image from telegraph.co.uk)My casserole was a lovely shade of Harrods green rather than this fiery orange, but you get the idea!What a great idea!  We so often end up buying cheap things time and time again and having to replace them when they wear out.  I have had a LeCresuset casserole dish, which is cast iron and probably bullet-proof - and Doc Marten shoes got me through the miles I walked around St Andrews when I was at uni and had only Shank's pony for transport.  Two brands I would recommend for sure.There are more details about Ms Button and the website here.There's a \"but\" in this though- some of these brands do demand a high initial outlay which takes them beyond the average wallet.  But when I consider whether this is a frugal, thrifty, anti-waste strategy, I think that it is. I'd rather save up and buy some good quality shoes from DM than have to continually buy new ones which wear out on a regular basis.  The Clark's boots that I have had for 10 years don't owe me a penny and I am now on the lookout for a replacement pair, so perhaps I'll have to look at another pair of DMs.  I did order a pair but when they arrived, they had some quite hard leather across the front of the ankle which was uncomfortable on me, so I sent those back for a refund, and I haven't looked for any more since then.  That was a design that didn't suit me, so I am not knocking the brand, just that style!Ladies who belong to a group on FB that I am in have also been sharing how they prefer old furniture, often handed down from previous generations, to buying new stuff.  I have to say as I look around this sitting room that all our furniture here has either been made by the FH or given to us from relatives - apart from one single armchair - so that is good going. A set of four dining chairs and a sofa came from my grandfather's house and are probably heading for their century celebrations!  This kind of furniture is durable, strong, well-made, and it can take a fair bit of bashing too......I love it."},

Lights are regularly left on and we walk about behind her, flicking them off........ She's young, and doesn't grasp the difference between being hard up and not wanting to waste things.  She'll learn, one hopes.  As for \"needing\" the money - there is not a lot of profit to be had in this as I am receiving a food grant for them which amounts to £6.80 a day - and that is all. There aren't many places you could lodge with dinner, bed, breakfast and laundry done for that, are there?  You can't put a value on the family atmosphere, either.As we are in the period of Lent, I am helping with some Lent group meetings, and we have this morning been talking about the differences between \"wants\" and \"needs\", and I shared the story I had read somewhere about a rich chap coming across another man eating a lentil-based dish and telling him that if he would become subservient to the King, he would not need to eat lentils. His comrade replied, I imagine with a wink, that if the rich chap would learn to be content with lentils, he would not need to be subservient to the King!Contentment has a great deal to recommend it, I am finding."},

Then there were the younger chaps who were just as funny - the YFG nudged me a couple of times as I was laughing too much for her liking!  Catherine Zeta Jones was good but the other female actresses like Sarah Lancashire and Alison Steadman were also brilliant.  The plot line is a little obvious but the costumes and sets seemed to be great, and it was just a good afternoon's outing.  When we got to my dad's and were telling him about it, he sounded intrigued and thought he might have to take his friend George and go to see it - that I would like to see!!The YFG is revising hard for mock AS level exams in the first two days when she goes back to school next week, so she had her nose back to the grindstone this evening.

So it hasn't cost us a penny to celebrate, because we aren't!  My Facebook feed has had some local floristry establishments advertising bouquets and bunches of roses at astronomical prices, and there have been ads on the radio for Aldi, which is also selling a wide range of Valentine's flowers, at slightly more reasonable prices.  The FH and I used to exchange the occasional card in the early years, but we didn't really do much latterly - it was more about every day things than a huge declaration on one day of the year.And actually, there is so much more to life than romantic love, isn't there?

That was very relaxed and great fun, and the kids enjoyed the playing table tennis, board games, crafting and making their own pizzas for tea.  Slight mishap when one of the friends from the church here didn't turn up, which bemused me as she had been keen, and then she walked in with her son at 5.55pm just as we were clearing up - she had times muddled up and thought it was 6-8pm instead of 4-6pm unfortunately!(image from telegraph.co.uk)Call the Midwife is dealing with the harrowing Thalidomide story in this series, and seems to be doing it sensitively and with a very caring ethos - but it is still desperately sad to watch.By Sunday night, I was only fit for collapsing in front of the tv and enjoying Call the Midwife and Vera, and I had rather a lie in on Monday morning.

The minister and I spent a blessed hour with her this afternoon, and her remembrances of her life as well as her joy in living at this time, right now, are evident. She's able to get out and about, share times of happiness with her friends, come to the knitting group at the chapel occasionally, and enjoy her three cats!  She is aware that she is dying, but she is doing it so well that she is really inspirational. Her attitude is what makes the difference, and the peace which she exudes is not given to everyone in her situation.

{"title": "Sad thoughts today", "date": "Tuesday 26 January 2016", "text": "I have been to quite the most upsetting funeral today that I have ever attended.  It was a \"community\" or \"public health\" funeral, because, it seems that although the gentleman had family, no one was willing to take responsibility for the funeral arrangements.  Our minister provided the service at the church, and then there was a burial in the village cemetery.  It was at one of \"my\" churches, so I was asked to attend to support the funeral steward and the minister.(image from goodfuneralguide.co.uk)We didn't really know what to expect, whether anyone would turn up, how it would pan out. It was unexpectedly well-attended as the family are an extensive local clan, but as large families sometimes are, it was rather a disjointed group of factions, and some went to the burial but not on to the pub afterwards, some went to the church and the pub but not the burial, and we believe that some were just going to come on later to the pub. The heartbreaking part of the funeral for me was that the minister was not able to do the usual talk about the deceased - when and where he had been born, his life, his profession, his family, his hobbies and interests, his contributions, his legacy - because no one in the family had had a good word to say about him: perhaps they felt justified, because he seems to have had a troubled life and not been very kind to many people......but to leave the minister only able to say that the deceased had been a father, grandfather, partner and uncle was a bit of a challenge for our poor chap. He did very well, sharing some thoughts about the scripture passages, and sharing a poem about God's forgiveness, but it was a struggle for him.From an outsider's point of view, the funeral varied from the more usual ones in that there was no order of service, only one hymn, no eulogy [as I have said], no limo behind the hearse. I understand that the grave will be very simple too. The family had organised flowers, and the coffin was just as most of the others I had seen recently. This has opened my eyes to a different side of ministry and to how some families can react to death. All the funerals I have been to before have been for someone who has been much loved and will be missed, but this was very different, and I feel the need to reflect upon it for some time before I come to terms with it.  Life really makes you think sometimes, eh?"},

There's a local chap who has one, which would be cheaper than the regular supplier that the chimney chap uses, but the chimney bloke hasn't got the right certificates for the local one......so that might be £180 for the use of a cherry picker from further afield, on top of the actual cost of the repair.  I just need him to get himself organised and get it repaired as I am a bit worried that the wet and windy weather that is forecast for this week will only exacerbate the problem.  I'm sort of hoping for the return of high pressure as that tends to be very cold weather but without wind - and I can definitely do without that at the moment.The YFG is better and doesn't seem to have suffered to the same extent that the Danish girl and I did. I've had a bit of a laugh with the Danish girl today as she is studying King Lear for her English studies, and she was struggling with it rather - well, just imagine it: English is not her first language, and then they ask her to study Shakespeare, which most native English-speakers find a challenge, and you can see why she may have been finding it hard!  We managed to find a good website which offered the original Shakespearean text alongside a \"modern\" translation that gave her a better handle on what the bard was on about.  Since I did Lear for my English A level too, it has been fun to try to dredge up some of what I remembered to help her.The YFG went on a gymnastics coaching course today and did well but it was quite a long day and she went to bed quite early tonight.  The violinist has done over 4 hours of practice today, and I haven't seen a lot of her. I just want to say that I love getting your comments, but I have also been blessed by one or two emails to the address that I shared up there on the right - it is wonderful to hear from you that way too, but don't be upset if I don't reply immediately as I probably only check that account a couple of times a week."},
{"title": "Blogging friend makes headlines!", "date": "Saturday 23 January 2016", "text": "Over at Life After Money, blog friend Ilona has been interviewed by her local paper, and it is interesting reading - although as regular readers of her blog, there isn't a lot we don't already know! It is great to see the frugal lifestyle in the press, although they had already interviewed her back in 2009.  There's a bit of repetition from the first article and it would have been lovely to have seen some of MeanQueen's amazing creativity shared in the papers - her artwork is amazing.  Her brilliant summerhouse did get into a snapshot though.  Well done, Ilona!Back in about 2000, a friend and I thought we would have a bash at a thrifty newsletter but that never really got off the ground as it was a bit challenging to co-ordinate back then when we lived at opposite ends of this island of ours.  Now that we have blogs, it is much easier to just put the information out there and it is up to folk to read if they are interested - it seems that some of you are indeed interested in reading and I continue to be grateful for all your comments and the sharing of your news in the comments. Thrift seems to come and go in popularity and it has risen in past years because of all the austerity measures and the dire need to make ends meet for some people.  For some, it is the need to manage of very little income, and for others, it is a desire to wring every pennyworth of value and not to waste money.  Whatever your reasons for reading here, and I know that some of you pop in just to keep up with our news, you are very welcome! Thrift is a major contributing factor in the way that we live here, and it hasn't always been easy - some people look down on those who don't worry too much about interior design, drive old bangers, make boots last for a decade, and have their hair cut in the village salon for £7.50......but it makes me secure in so many ways that I won't give it up easily and I won't part with cash for no good reason.  I'll give it away to causes that I support, yes, but I won't be scammed out of it - I've had some very dodgy emails in the past two days from people offering me huge sums of money for helping them to secure funds from abroad - and the \"delete\" button dealt with them very swiftly!"},

Got the YFG in bed again today - she's got the flu that the Danish girl and I had earlier in the month and she's looking pretty ropey this morning, all hot and flushed.  She went to the bathroom pretty early and turned the heat off because she was so hot, but that meant that the rest of us were rather chilly when we got up, but I couldn't blame her because I remember the sweltering heat that I felt then too.  She doesn't look like she will be well enough to go on a gymnastics course on Sunday so I have to deal with that on her behalf.I also have to preach on Sunday at a church where a dearly beloved member died very suddenly last week, and that whole congregation is in shock and grieving.  I am spending time thinking prayerfully about how I take the Lord's word to them this week.  I have to choose the hymns today because I need to notify the organist, so that is a priority this morning.But the good news is that the recent appraisal I went through means that the leadership team are going to recommend to the circuit meeting that my appointment be made permanent in February - I was on six months' probation.  I am mightily relieved about that.  There is also the possibility of another few hours each week, but that also has to go through the meeting, so they may not agree.....we'll see.I'm waiting in this morning for a chap who is coming to look at some leaky guttering and I have a supermarket delivery coming as well.  Then I have to go out this afternoon for a while....but not for long because I don't want to leave the YFG for too long, although I realistically know she'll likely be asleep. Take care and keep warm today - it is chilly out there, and we have had the hardest frost so far this winter."},
{"title": "A new project", "date": "Wednesday 20 January 2016", "text": "At one of \"my\" churches, we are launching a new Knit&Natter or Craft group, but we have been made aware that some people might like to come who don't do any yarn work of any kind.  I had a ponder about that, and dug out the pieces of a patchwork quilt that I started making when I was 18 or so - we won't say exactly how many years ago that was!!I took it along this morning to the church coffee morning where I knew that a couple of interested people would be, and showed them and shared my idea - and they were quite enthusiastic!  One lady has gone home with one section [like a rosette as they are hexagonal pieces] to complete as the outer row is only partially completed, and another friend has taken some of the material and the templates to make enough for another section.  All in all there should be 8 rosettes when they are all completed, and then we will be looking to join them together.  When it is all finished [don't hold your breath] we think that we will be able to find a use for it in the church fund raising calendar. It is all made from cheap poly cotton fabrics that I bought from Sheringham market when I was there one summer for about 5 or so weeks.  Some of them are quite different from one another, and others are similar fabrics but just in different shades, so it brings the work together and there is some unity in it.  Since it was bought for a very reasonable amount of money, I have no qualms about giving it away as it is of absolutely no use to anyone in my shelf unit - and I would hate to think how many house moves I have dragged that through!  Hopefully we will have it transformed into something useful and functional by about Easter....As for those who do want to do yarn work, they will be welcome to bring along whatever they are currently making, or we will have some charity knitting that they can help with as there are lots of charities requiring hats, scarves, blankets - we will keep all the fingers busy in one way or another, although I know that there will be tea and cake aplenty as well!"},
{"title": "Other income", "date": "Tuesday 19 January 2016", "text": "I have just last night managed to hit the 5000 points on YouGov in order to claim a pay out of £50. Now the question will be what to do with it?!  It has been a couple of years since my last YouGov pay out as I took some time off from doing the surveys - but I got the bug again as I could see how close I was to the pay out threshold, and £50 is well worth having.(image from oliversmalvern.co.uk)I certainly shan't be spending it on gin!What's £50 to me?A month's electricity payment, a third of a delivery of oil at this month's prices, about a tank and a half of diesel, a new tyre for the car, a week's groceries, a pair of boots, half the six monthly water bill, almost half the annual car tax fee............it makes a difference when you think of it like that.  If, on the other hand, it feels like silly money, it is easily frittered away.I've also almost earned £50 in Amazon vouchers on Shop&Scan, and within a few more weeks of sending in my shopping data, I will be able to download the vouchers. Now that Amazon is selling a more and more diverse range of products, I am not limited to buying books or DVDs - but actually, that is probably exactly what I will buy for myself as I do regard these vouchers as my own treat.  I have to have one!  The thing to weigh up will be what to buy from my wish list - the Downton Abbey DVDs are possibly in with a chance.  We shall see as I may have changed my mind by the time I have achieved the points.Those things I mentioned above are all current things in my spending review: the monthly electricity bill has just been reviewed as I changed the tariff, the oil is coming on Wednesday, I filled the car up with diesel yesterday, two new tyres had to go on the car yesterday afternoon, the groceries were purchased at the weekend, the boots are still being researched, the water bill was paid at the end of December, and the car tax bill was paid last week ready for the end of the month.  I could have done with a bigger pay out from YouGov really!  But it is one way that I make a few extra pounds now and again, and it is something that many people could do too."},
{"title": "Call the Midwife - spoiler alert", "date": "Monday 18 January 2016", "text": "(image from mirror.co.uk)Having been to a discussion group on Saturday morning at the circuit meeting about whether the Methodist Church should consider revisiting its definition of \"marriage\" [yes, I think it should], it was great to see Call the Midwife last night addressing so many issues which we are still grappling with fifty five years after the date at which the new series is set [1961]. We have Patsy and Delia in a gay relationship, there was poor old Sister Monica struggling with giving up sweet things for Lent, a baby born with a serious disability, and the beginnings of what looks like a bit of a struggle between Trixie and Sister Julienne.  And then there was Trixie's recognition of her alcohol problems as we learned that she has started to go to Alcoholics Anonymous.  The new uniforms were a bit of a giggle for the nurse-midwives, and there looks as though there may be a fledgling romance developing between one of the midwives and the curate, although I think that might ruffle some of Trixie's feathers.  There is the opportunity to develop a story-line about body image in there somewhere as the keep fit at the church hall looks set to be a feature of this series. It is heartwarming for me to see faith portrayed in mainstream television - there was a minute when the baby was born last night and her mother saw her for the first time and I am sure that Mrs Turner and Sister Cynthia shared a quiet prayer as they waited outside the room.  In other news, the violinist won a local round of a music competition on Saturday night and came home with a trophy - her first!  She was quite pleased, and now progresses to the next round at the end of February.  Good luck to her!  Hoping to be back later in the day with a menu plan for the week - my task for the day."},
{"title": "Stretching and saving", "date": "Sunday 17 January 2016", "text": "On Friday night, I cooked six sausages and let the YFG and her friend, who was here to share a meal with us, each have two. That left two in the fridge - Friday night was a complicated night and there were four combinations of concoctions made here to use up bits and pieces as well as cater for various needs.Anyway, last night, the two sausages were sliced up: each made nine slices, and the slices were shared around a four-hole Yorkshire pudding tray.  They were popped in the little oven for about 15 minutes and then had the batter poured over them. Served with a little hot gravy and the microwaved left over veg from Friday night, the YFG and the Danish girl each enjoyed a couple of little Yorkies with sausage slices.......and they smelled good here last night - and the plates were cleared. It's very good to be able to use up the leftovers and not waste things! On Friday I was also able to add another little individual portion sized dish to my collection - I have two white enameled dishes, perfect for a portion of fish pie or shepherd's pie, for example, but there are three girls here most of the time, so I really needed a third.  Bargain! I found one on a sale table in one of the churches on Friday for the grand sum of 40p.  I snapped it up. We have been having some issues with portion control with the Austrian girl and really, she has been eating more than her fair share on occasions, which has meant that I have had to institute these individual portions so that she gets her share, and can't eat half of someone else's as well, as happened with the chilli incident before Christmas: I had put vegetarian chilli out on the table for the two EF girls to share [YFG doesn't like it and I can't eat it] but it was more of a 3:1 in favour of Austria, and when the Danish girl thought that she might like seconds, there was none left because Austria had had three lots!  And my portions are not stingy!  So now, there are portions given or Austria gets a portion of something vegetarian and the YFG and Denmark get meat or fish.  Complicated but fairer all round.   Some of the little foibles that we have to find ways to get under control before they get out of hand but in the typical British way, I can't do confrontation, so I have to go about these things in my way, which is not the Austro-German way.........but I am learning all the time!Hope you are having a good weekend - I am so looking forward to the return of Call the Midwife tonight - the tv is booked and there is a comfy chair with my name on it xx"},
{"title": "Strategising", "date": "Saturday 16 January 2016", "text": "Long words at this hour of the morning are not necessarily a good thing........but I'll have a go.What I mean is that I need to draw myself up a list of things to start doing again - things that I know work but that I have slipped out of the habit of doing, for one reason or another.  A lot of things went by the wayside when the FH was ill, and I didn't have so much time, but then more went west when I started work after he died, and I have been struggling to keep track of things since I started the new job this year.There is no sense in worrying about what I haven't been doing.  I've had one late payment on a credit card, just because the paperwork isn't as organised as it used to be, and the freezer is stuffed full because I am not tracking things well enough in there.  We are also throwing away too much food.Well, nothing like hitting the confessional, eh?!Let's start a bit gently. First of all, I am going to set up my Household Planner folder.  I used to swear by this, but I never got round to setting up one at this time last year, and limped through 2015 without it, not knowing where vital paperwork was, and hating my inefficiencies.  All I need to do is print off a monthly calendar page for each month, a spending chart for the month to slide in behind it, and then to actually file everything vital that comes in.  It works but I just have to set it up and do it.Then I am going to do an inventory of the house - what food we have in stock, the cleaning materials, the toiletries, the laundry detergent, etc - so that I don't buy any more until we have used up what we have here already!And I am also going to re-instate the weekly menu planning.  It was so great to know what I was going to cook each day.  With a vegetarian on board, life needs to be organised.Finally, my spending diary is coming out again and I shall record every single penny spent. Knowing where the money is going really helps to stop leaks and control spending.That should be enough to start with, don't you think?  There is a lot more I could do, but if I try to do too much too soon, I shall crash and burn.  Realistically, I can get my teeth into these routines again and see results, which will encourage me."},

{"title": "End of 2015 finance review", "date": "Thursday 14 January 2016", "text": "I finally found some time last night and the review of last year's savings got made up to date. Contrary to my expectations, it seems that we ended the year just over £5K better off than we had started the year - wow!  We spent quite a lot of money last year - repairing the fence, turning the chicken run into lawn, installing a shower over the bath, putting a new cam belt on the Skoda, painting, acquiring new-to-us furniture for the EF girls' room, a holiday to Sheringham in the October half term - so I am really pleased to have hit the £5K again.As for this year - well, we can hope!I have five more months of income from the EF girls, and we have decided that we are not going to have any more for the 16-17 academic year, as it is the YFG's A level exam year, and her application to uni year, so we may need to be going on some open day trips, as well as recognising the need for her to have peace and tranquility for studying.  I shall think about having more in the future....but they are leaving mid June, so we will have a spare room for the summer - I may have to have thoughts about that.There is the vaguest hint that there may be some more hours at work in the offing - I shall snap those up if they do come through, as I am loving the job and would welcome the extra time to do more of it.I still have a workshop with some beekeeping equipment lurking therein - this has to be the year to get it shifted, and bring some cash into the coffers again. (image from bbc.co.uk via Facebook and boilerjuice.com)On a positive note, the price of oil is so low that I am keeping the tank topped up - would you believe that the oil I bought earlier this week would have cost me over 60p/l a couple of years ago? Shocking how the prices change so no sense in letting it get too low in these economic times.  We have a good load of wood in stock, and UJ has almost finished cutting up all the rough lengths of wood that there were about, so we have several winters' worth of wood in there.  As good as money in the bank in many ways.I am going to spend a bit more time strategising my plans and money this morning.  It all means that my plans for the future continue to look secure for now, thank goodness, and I won't need to sell the house just yet...."},

What with the new job, the EF girls, the EFG being home, the flu and all, I just don't seem to have had the time to sit down and review things the way that I used to.  If we are to continue to spend wisely and save money in areas, I must get on top of this!I made a start yesterday when I had a look at the current price of home heating oil.  It was triggered by me seeing on Monday night that Tesco were actually selling diesel for less than petrol - 99.7p/l compared with 99.9p/l - I know that that is a tiny amount, but I couldn't remember the last time I had seen diesel cheaper than petrol, and thought that perhaps the oil price had dropped again. (image from which.co.uk)I went through my usual price comparison procedure though - check Boilerjuice first and then, with that information, call my local supplier [because I like to support local businesses, but I also don't want to be taken advantage of by them...].  The Boilerjuice price was 25.37p/l and the local company quoted over 32p/l at first. Then I mentioned the other price I had, and all of a sudden, they could bring the price down to 25.10p/l.  So 600 litres at the new price was £46 less than it would have been if I had accepted their first price.  That is quite a reduction, and a bigger one than I have had from them before.  It still makes me mad that some people will accept the first price that they are quoted - just don't do it!!On a separate note, we are waving good-bye to the EFG this morning as she makes her way back to Aberdeen for the start of term on Monday.  She's been here for nearly a month, and we have had a lovely time with her.  Weirdly [and perhaps some of the Scottish readers can comment] she has lectures on both Good Friday and Easter Monday and will not finish for her \"Easter\" break until the 1st April, so we will not have her home actually at Easter although she will come down afterwards.  I shall be looking forward to that.

But another admin can alter the settings, and I am no longer required.  Would have been polite if I had been otherwise notified.A neighbour who is a teacher turned up at the door a few minutes later with a bunch of flowers.  She had been given them by a parent at the school on Friday and is going away for the Christmas break to visit relatives, and thought that perhaps we could enjoy the flowers.  That was really kind of her, and we have put them in a vase in the sitting room - they are lovely flowers!And then there is the \"followers\" on here - up and down like a yoyo!  There's 128 for ages, then one leaves, another comes and two more leave......And my point is?  Well, it came to me last night that it is such a good thing that I do not measure my value, my self-esteem, in the way that others treat me.  If my self-worth reflected the way the world reacts to me, it would be a difficult life.  Thanks to my secure faith in Jesus Christ, I know that I am loved, saved and forgiven in His Mighty Name, and so I rest in Him.  And He is all that matters in the end."},
{"title": "Mystery parcels", "date": "Thursday 17 December 2015", "text": "When I came home from work this lunchtime, a courier delivery van was in the street ahead of me, and then it reversed onto my driveway...couldn't think of anything I had ordered so really expected the Danish girl's name to be on the parcel as her relatives have been sending her lots of parcels! But no!  Had my name on it....the mystery deepened.  It was an interesting parcel with a label that didn't give anything away, so I rushed around and popped the frozen fish away before I grabbed a pair of scissors and attacked the straps around the parcel.It was a sweet little hamper for Christmas from EF, the organisation through which I am hosting the girls.  Two mini bottles of wine, some Father Christmas chocs to hang on the tree, some Walkers shortbread, a mini Christmas pud, some tiny jars of jam.....but the best bit was a Christmas tree bauble in white ceramic. It has been individually made to reflect our family and students for it has their national flags on it side by side under the Union Jack. What a thoughtful memento of our year together.And that was the mystery solved. There will be a couple of other parcels turning up in the next few days as I struggle to complete the shopping for the girls!  I made fudge this afternoon and this evening we have sat and made 28 little trays from card, lined them with tissue paper, popped 4 pieces of fudge in each, clingwrapped them and added a bow of ribbon. Hey presto - a present for each teacher and teaching assistant in the school, to be delivered in the morning.  I have shared the fudge recipe before and it still works!"},
{"title": "The shame!", "date": "Monday 14 December 2015", "text": "Having studied it for A levels all those years ago, and written some rather good essays on it [well, they got As!], the shame of hearing the YFG say at dinner tonight, \"King Lear? Who wrote that?\" The EF girls and I fell about laughing and then the darling girl recovered herself and enquired, \"What? Was it, like, Shakespeare then?\" It is an A level text once more this year, and I have lent my battered and annotated copy to the Danish girl, who is also going to read my essays for some light relief, so that she is ready to attack it with gusto in January. Her being Danish and all, it is a shame it is not Hamlet, but you can't have everything!Being spiritually prepared for Christmas is quite different from being practically ready......I've been to carol services, advent bible studies, songs of praise for Christmas, band concerts, etc, but I still haven't got all the gifts sorted out, and the days are indeed hastening on.  In a good way, I am excited because that means the EFG will soon be home - the exams are over as of this afternoon!  On the other hand, there is no sign of the washing machine being repaired before the 23rd, so I am going to beg the use of a neighbour's up the road to do a dark load tomorrow.One success to report - we were able to buy the Ravensburger Christmas puzzle [limited edition for 2015] in Tesco at the weekend. I haven't ever seen it in there before, and I was pleased to be able to pick it up alongside the few bits of shopping we had popped in to get. Compared to Amazon, it was only £9.50 to their £12.99 so a few pennies left in my purse from that.The best thing, from a very practical point of view, is that if I don't get Christmas all ready on time this year, I can always try again next year! [And one last question - did one of my lovely readers send me a piece called The Angels' Rest Room? I've used it twice this year already and it is getting rave reviews - people love it!  But I can't remember where it came from - I'm sorry - so if it was you, please would you comment and let me know?]"},

We've also got Christmas music events for the violinist, which is involving some taxi-driving duties for me, and then there was a hospital appointment for the YFG yesterday with the ongoing problem she has with her wrist - we're now waiting for an ultrasound appointment to make a decision about an operation next year...I made time for a quick hair cut yesterday and regretted it when I got home - I need to find another hairdresser in 2016.  I now have to look as I do for about three weeks until it grows again, and I am not that happy with it. All the television news about the flooding in Cumbria puts our wee problems in the shade, and it is heartwarming to see the way that the communities there have pulled together and helped one another. A miracle cow that floated 18 miles downriver, shops cleaned and opened up again in just a few days, the community fund which has raised over a million pounds since last weekend, radio broadcasters doing extended programming in order to keep folk company in the dark night hours. I have also made my annual donation to the Salvation Army in memory of my mum.  I'm sure that the SA has also been busy in the Lakes helping folk and I continue to support their work when I can.And I made a cake last night - first one in weeks!"},

It is a difficult reading, from 1 John, full of \"knoweth\" and \"loveth\" and words which make one struggle to know where to place the emphasis.  The chap who should be doing the reading was there last night, and I have hopes that he has turned up this morning so that she doesn't actually have to do it, so that she might get an easier reading when she does actually stand up there and do it for real next year!It is a fantastic place, very overwhelming in size and majestical architecture, as you might imagine. The details are astounding, and the sheer scale of the building and craftsmanship just defy description.  I'm just glad that I don't have to preach in anywhere quite on this scale!The chaplain was doing some name dropping as he was talking last night, saying that his friend, an actress, had been in to do some coaching with the readers who are reading at the recorded BBC services.  Only Rosamund Pike.  The YFG was a bit disappointed that she wasn't there last night to offer a few pointers!"},

Are these storm names amusing you as much as they are us? Whilst not making light of the damage and distress that storms can cause, it does seem that someone somewhere is making them out to be more important than they used to be.  Names used to be for hurricanes and the like, not for a brisk wind coming in off the sea [and yes, that is me underplaying it - I know that they are some pretty fierce winds out there today!].  The weather seems to be changing year on year and we are getting a lot more of this wet and windy weather than I ever remember from years ago....but then, perhaps I don't remember it that accurately - I am far more likely to remember pleasant summer days than drab November ones.The Fens are clothed in a coat of brown at the moment - the roads are slathered in mud, which rapidly transfers itself to the cars and vans, which are now all brown.  The verges are similarly muddy, and since the fields are ploughed over in the most part - they are deep and rich hues of brown as well.......there's a lot of it about!  Thank goodness for the days when we see gloriously blue skies to contrast with all the dullness occasionally.  Is it any wonder that we long for the bright lights of the festive period?  But we must be patient."},

An antler headband adorned her head, and a flashing Rudolph nose was attached with elastic.Heads turned, as you can imagine. Then she started dishing out elf hats that she had brought along to share.  This is my boss, the new superintendent!!  Just shy of her 60th birthday, she is huge fun, as last night proved, and game for a laugh all the time.  When the compere chappy asked if anyone wanted to have a go at the solo for Once in Royal David's City, up she went and belted it out - she has a lovely voice.  We had a great night in her company, and the evening certainly got livened up when she arrived!  I'm loving working with her, I have to say!I've also been to a Christmas Tree Festival this afternoon, and that was really inspiring too, if a little less exciting!"},

{"title": "Another birthday passing", "date": "Tuesday 17 November 2015", "text": "\"The FH would have been 78 today\" but I am not one for making too big a deal out of it now. That's why that remark is in quotation marks, because I haven't been going round, saying it to all and sundry.  I have remarked on my FB page that yes, it is the anniversary of his birthday, and I have sort-of indicated that this is the last time I will mark it on there, as I have further commented that I am sure he would be pleased with how we are getting on with our lives, as he wanted us to do.  We cannot live with one foot in the past, and we must look to the future.  He would not have wanted us to spend our lives in his shadow. (image from sugarshack.co.uk)He did love Maltesers!He has been gone for nearly 18 months now, and we are getting used to the new life that we have. The girls are both doing well in their studies, if not entirely with their friends [EFG hassles over flatmates, etc] and they have good heads on their shoulders.  They are reliable, sensible, focused, level-headed most of the time, and quite mature for their ages - although I still can't get to grips with the EFG being 20 next birthday...how did that happen?!  The YFG and I have talked again lately about a dog becoming part of our lives. That is about us moving on.The FH's sister has emailed me to say that she will be ringing me today. She deals with grief and loss in a very different way, and always wanted to speak to him on their mother's birthday, for example. I do get it - it is about connecting with someone else who remembers the person who has died, and having shared space for memories.  I'll gladly speak with her, even though I would be happy to chat with her any day of the year - she need not wait for his birthday.  There are thousands of ways to express grief, and I have been touched lately by some unhelpful posts on FB, which were absolutely well-intentioned, but just not right for me. They were largely of the \"it's OK to be in pieces because grieving deeply means that you loved deeply\". Right. So not being in pieces all the time means I didn't love him enough?  The people posting those thoughts, and the ones sharing them, perhaps haven't grieved an awful lot in their lives, or perhaps they have, but only in one way.  Their way is not my way, which is not your way, widows and widowers of the world.Every single one of us does this our own unique way, and every way is right. Every way is true and deeply felt. I went to a meeting last week for people who had lost their partners through bereavement.  It was part of my work in the circuit, but it worked as I fitted in as a widow.  Let me tell you, there was a spirit of joy and warmth in that room as about 45 people came together in fellowship and shared community. I am going to work on setting up other groups like that in other areas of the circuit because we are sure that there is a need.I know other widows read my ramblings here, and I just want to let you know that you just need to do whatever you need to do to get through it.  There is no right way. No wrong way. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for doing this your way. I'm doing it my way.  God bless us all x"},
{"title": "Now what have we done?", "date": "Sunday 15 November 2015", "text": "I should know about gratitude....I've been consciously practicing it for more than three years, in a serious way. If someone does something for you, it is the right thing to do, whether they have bought you a present, unblocked a drain or dropped something at the dry cleaner on their way past.  Well brought up folks say thanks.(image from lordsgifts.co.uk)Appreciation is another side of the same coin.  It is ever so slightly different. These days, I am sick to death of people gushing on the tv and saying, \"Thank you SO much!\" all the time. It feels as if they think that just saying \"Thanks\" is meaningless and so they have to quantify it in some way.So the chap next door risked life and limb to go up on the roof, and we took him and his son their wee gift tonight.  Awkward does not even begin to describe the scene. \"Well, that was a stupid thing to do!\" was the opening comment from the son when I said we had just popped round to say \"Thank you!\" and then the dad went on about, \"We didn't do it for that\" and they dug themselves deeper and deeper into it, until I just gave the son the bottle of wine, expressed our gratitude once more, and left them to their splutterings. What a contrast between them and the computer chappie, who just said, \"Oooh! I like that, thanks,\" and popped it in the fridge.There's all kinds of reasons for their awkwardness - perhaps!  Perhaps they don't get thanked very often, perhaps they don't do things for other folk that much to get thanked, I don't know.  It may even be a man-thing - like man-flu?There's another little point here but it is a serious one - we widows do not want pity.  We are strong women, we have been through all sorts, and so we can cope with disasters of all kinds, because we have already been through the major disaster, and we are still here.  We don't want people to be on our team because they feel sorry for us, and we do expect to be able to thank our team when we are supported. Lesson for today - be gracious when someone thanks you, because it makes the person saying it feel pretty rubbish if you are not......but we'll keep putting their bins out for them when necessary :)"},

It was on Windows 8 which the YFG and I both detest, and was running quite slowly, so he took it back to Windows 7, and it now goes like the wind around the internet, and loads programmes up much more speedily.  This man's wife is also a friend of mine through the church, and is possibly about to undergo a major operation, so she is often in my prayers. Another chap, my neighbour, has been up on my utility room roof this morning to replace a tile which had slipped out of place and was threatening to come down. He has built his own house elsewhere in the past, and I knew that he would be able to recommend local tradespeople who would be reliable, so I approached him to let me know who to ask about the roof.  With my set of ladders, he was easily able to do the job himself with his son, who passed things up and fetched things, and I was very relieved that they were able to sort it out in about 20 minutes. Ever with an eye to the pennies, two bottles of Sainsbury's best for a tenner found their way into the shopping trolley this afternoon. One delivered and one to be dropped in tomorrow, with chocolates for the son because we didn't know what he liked to drink [he is over 18!].Our last minister very wisely told my friend, T, when her husband left her, not to lean too heavily on one person when she needed help, and I am doing my best to follow that advice as well. People are generally glad to help out if they can, but it wouldn't be right to ask the same person time and time again to give advice or assistance. I have established a sort of mini-team around the place for help: the computer chap, the neighbour who gives house maintenance advice and assistance, the chap at the garage who maintains the car, my sister who helps with lifts for the YFG and taking her places she needs to go that I can't manage for one reason or another, my good friend T for general chats, UJ for gardening, and my dad for encouragement.  Cousins J & A are a tremendous source of support and their son M took the EFG's baggage back to Aberdeen in September and has already made plans to take her stuff up there next year.  We are incredibly blessed to be surrounded by people who love us and support us: in addition to these people, I know of at least half a dozen more who would help me if I asked them!I'd rather be blessed with people like this than win the Lottery, I have to say....."},

The top section had become a curry, alongside a sweet potato and some spinach, and so I had the other bit left. The violinist suggested soup, and indicated that she would like that for dinner tonight, so that is what I made. It was easy, really, when I found a recipe which I could adapt to the ingredients which I had available. The squash was chopped up and roasted in my little oven for about half an hour in a wee puddle of oil in a roasting dish.  I fried off an onion in a smidge of butter and oil, and then added two garlic cloves [there's a bug going round in a Fenland school at the moment - not ours, yet - so I am going heavy on the alliums] and when the squash was finished roasting, it was added to the onions with 800ml of vegetable stock.  I added a teaspoon of curry powder for a bit more depth of flavour, and then I used the stick blender to whizz it all up.  I served it with a dollop of creme fraiche in each bowl.It made two bowls of soup, which was perfect for the two EF girls as the YFG hates butternut squash so she opened a tin of chicken soup. They had hot cheese toasties and a microwave syrup sponge pudding with custard for dessert - a lovely, warming storecupboard/use it up kind of supper!  No photos as they ate it too quickly..."},

Wow. Children who get up at 5 am and walk for an hour or more to be in school by 7.30 am. Children who are orphaned, and cared for by the school ministry team.  Lack of water so desperate that they are getting money from Lakeland [used to be Lakeland Plastics, but I think it is now just Lakeland] for water tanks, and they have also drilled a well - 230 feet down to the water table. Lakeland has already funded the building of a clinic at the school for the local community - I'm impressed: I may make the odd purchase there again if they are doing good things with some of the profits!  Children in the area need to pay to attend the school, as it is a private school - government funding doesn't run to many schools, unfortunately. There are more than 600 children in this particular school, and the Bishop is in charge of 500 pastors who cover the surrounding area - a big area!  He's my age, and he came to Glasgow to the International Bible College there, but then decided that he would go back to Uganda to help his people there - he could have stayed and had a much easier life, I think, but decided to go back and give back.  He and his wife have a gorgeous baby, but she was one of triplets: only Priscilla survived.

Research has proved better outcomes for this.(image from ikea.com)I shared this post, jokingly adding the tagline, \"this must be why people have trouble getting to the 9 am lectures, EFG\" and Oh, my word, what a debate that unleashed. The one or two of you who are friends on Facebook may have seen it!The gist of the comments was that teenagers today have no backbone, no stamina, no oomph, and what would have happened if soldiers in the Somme trenches had said that they would wait until midday to fight?!  Another \"friend\" commented that he had been up at 6 am for work for 35 years and what is the world coming to?There's a lack of appreciation for our young people, a terribly narrow minded view of our teenage population and a tendency to have a very broad brush approach when considering the average teenager.  It's shameful, really, that some people are so stuck in the past that they have no ability to look to the future.My teenagers, all four of them, work hard here and in Aberdeen. The EFG has had a full day today of concentrating hard and working in the labs; the YFG has had a long day at school, helping with an open evening after school so that I picked her up at 8 pm, and then she sat down and re-wrote an essay that had been returned to her today with a low mark, so she has done it again tonight: the violinist often practises for between 3 and 6 hours a day, depending on whether it is a school day, and is up at 6 most days, including Saturdays, for a full day of work of one kind or another. The Danish girl has a terrible toothache today with a wisdom tooth coming through and could hardly speak this morning, so I offered her the opportunity to stay at home, but she was determined to go to school as she had an essay due. She went, but she's struggling now. We live in a different world today, and whilst some occupations do demand a standard approach to the workday, we have more and more people working shifts in all sorts of jobs, and we have more flexibility in the workplace.  We are also more appreciative of creativity, and an increasing number of self-employed people, who are able to set their own hours. If you are planning to teach for a career, you need to understand that you are likely to start work at 7.30 am to be well prepared for when the children arrive an hour later,  but if you are a writer, for example, you may well choose to write late into the night when the inspiration strikes. Thank goodness for variety!  Thank goodness for teenagers who inspire and challenge us to move with the times - I love mine....."},

Neither of their countries has the same scale of royalty that we do - the Danish royal family is much smaller and more informal, and the Austrians now have a President.(image from dailymail.co.uk)(image from bbc.co.uk)This morning I am off to the chapel to lead the Remembrance Day worship there. I have a reflective service to offer, with a lot of prayer.Neither of the girls were aware of how seriously we take Remembrance in this country and have both been a little overwhelmed at all the services, programmes on the telly, and events going on that they have seen. Their countries seem to hardly mark it at all.  What a shame, but I am pleased that here, we continue to honour the past whilst we work towards a more peaceful future."},

I'm not putting a photo of her on here.The article explained that this person has over 50 million followers on one of the social media platforms, and went on to put that into context, saying that she has more followers than there are people in Canada.  There are plenty of countries in the world with populations only a tenth of the size of her follower party.What I can't grasp is why people \"follow\" her and what it is that she has celebrity status for?  Well, actually, the link above explains a little of it, and it isn't all that savoury.  As far as I can tell, she's got such a following on account of her relationships with other people, and her family background.  But not for anything she has done herself - she hasn't raised thousands for charity, run back to back marathons, rowed the Atlantic, found a miracle cure for some terrible disease, served her country in some remarkable way - and that makes me sad. I'm sad that my daughters and others of their generation are being given a message that people can be swayed into adoring someone like this, and hanging on their every word and fashion choice, just because they happen to know someone or be related to someone else.  I'm trying to bring up my daughters to DO things, not just BE people.......do you see the difference?  I can't remember who said it, but there is a quote somewhere about an aspiration to be a writer, and someone responded that all the person had to do was simply to Write, and then they would be a writer - but they did have to DO something about it, not sit there and merely express the desire to BE a writer...I know that there are two sides to every story, so I'd be interested in your take on my thoughts, as usual x"},

{"title": "Vegetarian meal to share", "date": "Wednesday 4 November 2015", "text": "Last night's dinner for the girls [I had to go out for a meeting] was stuffed pasta shells. The EFG introduced me to large pasta shells before she went back to uni this autumn and I have used them a couple of times. They are BIG and I served each girl with 5 of them last night. First of all, I set a cup of lentils to boil in water whilst I put the pasta shells in another pan of water to cook to just before they got to the al dente stage.  You want them still quite firm for the stuffing stage, but not still hard.  Whilst all that was happening, I fried an onion and then added two grated carrots, a tin of chopped tomatoes and two cloves of garlic, crushed. When the lentils were cooked, I added them to that mixture and it was all combined together.  Smelled gorgeous!I made a quick cheese sauce at this point.  I put a generous puddle of it in the bottom of a Pyrex glass dish.When the pasta was at the right stage, I rinsed it in cold water to cool it down so that I could handle it. Then I took dessert-spoonfuls of the lentil mixture, filled the shells one at a time and laid them on to the cheese sauce in the dish. When I had filled all the shells, the remaining cheese sauce was poured over them so that there was a layer pretty much everywhere.  This dish was then put into the oven for about 25 minutes to cook through and go ever so slightly brown on the top. There was some lentil mixture left so I popped that into a couple of small margerine tubs and stashed it in the freezer.I served this with some spinach leaves, salad tomatoes and chopped cucumber.  It all got eaten!I can't point to a source for this recipe, as the EFG told me the first version I made a few months ago and I have added the carrot and garlic this time around so it is evolving. If you are meat-eaters, I think it would work well if you stuffed the shells with a bolognese-type sauce mixture too.Best of all, the entire thing was made of things I had in the cupboard, and it is cheap and cheerful for November's budget menu. When I make it again, I shall try to remember to take a photo or two..."},

In my minimum spend November, this sort of thing is definitely off the cards. We have had the official notification and the Ofsted reports will be photocopied and distributed to parents today when the children go home from school.  It's a historic result for us, as the school has never achieved this before - we are G-O-O-D!  Good!  GOOD!  I'd like to shout it from the rooftops across the village and tell everyone - but I'll settle for sharing it with you - I am so proud of our team.  (image from callington-tc.org.uk)"},

And then there was pudding...well, UJ brought me some pears the other week, and there are some languishing in the garage because I don't want to add to the not inconsiderable amount of frozen stewed pears that I already have in stock.  I made two mini pear and ginger crumbles for the EF girls, and the YFG, who hates cooked fruit, just looked on as she was quite stuffed from the hash browns by that point!I like to make meals from storecupboard staples that don't cost too much.  Spending today has amounted to £2 on two tubs of Utterly Butterly [the margerine that the village shop happened to have on special offer] and some orange squash at £1.25 for the bottle.  I've had a mostly stay at home kind of a day, so no problem to keep the purse under control, really!An evening by the fire, knitting and watching Doc Martin, has rounded off the day nicely.  Pop back in the morning for some exciting news."},

Amazing sisters coming together to support one another....I love being a part of it, however tiny a cog in the wheel that I might be!And the other story - well, Tracey's doctors are continuing to treat her and her husband is planning her homecoming, which is a huge turnaround from the other day when he had to tell their children that she might not make it.  She is not out of the woods yet, by a long way, but things are looking hopeful.  I'm continuing to hold her and the family in my prayers.Here at home, the girls have broken up for half term and had the day to themselves today. One went off to Cambridge on the train and did some exploring, and the other EF girl stayed here and watched the whole of the first series of Call the Midwife, which she has completely fallen in love with!  I have bobbed in and out whilst doing other things and enjoyed watching bits and pieces of it with her.  The YFG has done some homework but there's more to be done! I've been out and about again - a craft group at one chapel this morning and a drop-in and prayer group at another one this afternoon. It is lovely to walk alongside these people and get to know them better - one old chap this afternoon was telling us about the amazing Rottweiler bitches that he has kept in the past. Not a breed I fancy at all, but he has had three in a row and loved them all, and really enjoyed telling us about one of them called Betsy this afternoon.  His diminutive wife is an adorable woman who sits and smiles constantly, in a little world of her own. He is well over 90 and she is not far behind him, but has dementia, and can't remember how much sugar she has in her tea, but he tells her patiently each time she has a cup, and it was a blessing to watch how loving he is with her.Tomorrow I have a service to prepare and some shopping to do, as well as some ironing.

Glennon Doyle Melton has been to Haiti and come back with a report and a mission to raise money to help the women there to give birth more safely, and even to carry their children to term. When I look back and consider how lucky I was to get fantastic care and give birth in a dedicated maternity hospital in Scotland, I had no hesitation in giving what I could to her \"Together Rising\" Love Flash Mob today. She's aiming to raise enough to build an extension to the maternity service building in Haiti so that even more women and babies can be helped.  It brings tears to my eyes to read about women giving birth alone and with no help at all, as well as young women being encouraged by their families to take concoctions to try to abort their babies.  The best thing about the Love Flash Mob is that it is made up of lots and lots of little donations as the maximum donation at one time is $25 - I don't think it stops you if you go back again and donate more though!(image from momastery.com)And then there is a heart-wrenching story which I just found out about yesterday in which a beloved mother of many [7, I think] is in a critical condition in hospital in Australia, fighting for her life after an aneurysm damaged her bowel. She has hardly any bowel left after a run of operations, and it doesn't sound as if there is a lot more that the team can do, except wait and hope that her body can begin to heal itself.  I'm praying for her and her family.What is inspiring about these situations is the way in which people come together to help one another.

We sat around chatting after dinner and finally moved after about an hour - we are certainly engaging the EF girls in conversation here.  They tell horror stories about other host families that they have heard about from the other students and I wonder why some people bother to host if they are going to treat the students in that manner.  We had a laugh tonight and took a mock UK citizenship test that the YFG found online - we passed as a group but I am not sure I would have passed on my own......why are there a different number of people in a jury in Scotland, for example?

I'm also concerned about a spiritualist group. I've been doing some research on that too, as I know very little about it.  My cousin has been very interested in this sort of thing in the past, and my EF girls had their palms read at the show we went to last weekend - we separated and I didn't know until we were in the car coming home - they were relieved of £10 each for a 5 minute \"reading\".........it seems that these people play to the part of human nature which wants to know everything, and basic Christianity is too boring as we wait to see what God will bring into our lives.  I can understand the temptations as there are loads of things that I would love to know, and now, but actually, I also realise that there are things that I am not ready to know, and I am content to wait for God's time.  In the instant world that we live in these days, people don't want to wait any longer.Anyway, I shall add that to the long list of things I want to chat through with the boss lady at church when I see her again, as she is very experienced and will have words of wisdom to share.  Between now and then, I have to sort this service for Sunday and then write a presentation on all that I learned yesterday......Toodle pip for now x"},

Absolutely crippling anxiety finished her off there - although the job in itself was not difficult and the people were lovely, she said.  I had to take her to the doctor yesterday morning to get a sick note to cover the notice period as she was unable to return. It is a shame in many ways, because having a foot in the door at JL was a good step for her, but there were quite a few things against it from the start - the length of the day and the travel arrangements for example.  She was unable to articulate what was the problem but she was manifesting so many physical symptoms of stress and anxiety that she was beginning to be unable to function, such was her dread of the next Saturday. She came home this last Saturday, pleased that she hadn't been stuck on the dishwasher all day, and I thought she was making progress, but by Sunday night, the symptoms were back and she was clearly struggling already at the thought of going back the next week.......so off we went to the GP yesterday morning and all has been sorted, and it is finished. When I was speaking to a very wise friend, she recognised that although the job in itself was not difficult, and was indeed well within the YFG's capabilities, it was in a place she did not know, with a horde of people she did not know, and in a large organisation with a lot of protocols and procedures with which she was not familiar - and she had the travel to cope with as well as being away from home for an extended period.......my friend was surprised that the YFG took it on in the first place on reflection.  She has recommended a position with shorter hours, closer to home and in a smaller and more informal organisation to start with.  We will just have to see whether anything like that comes up!And that was most of yesterday taken up.Tonight I have been to a meeting in the village in which a local charity dishes out dosh to people between 16 and 25 who are still in full time education - the EFG applied for a grant from them and is thrilled tonight to get a text from me, telling her that £200 will soon be heading in her direction - a very welcome boost to her funds!Who knows what tomorrow will bring?!"},

I didn't have the required maple syrup, and in noting down the list of the ingredients from the website, I totally omitted the sugar!  Noticing that I didn't have the syrup, I stuck in a cup of sugar to compensate, not realising that there were supposed to be THREE cups of sugar in addition to the syrup - whoops!  My loaves ended up rather more orangey that the ones in the picture on the recipe website, but the girls have eaten one of them already and said that it was nice! So I am not too disheartened about that one.On The Quince Tree, I saw a recipe for a cheap and cheerful cake, that I had already seen on Facebook. There's no eggs, milk or butter in the recipe so it is quite cheap to make, and I was further encouraged when Ang over at Tracing Rainbows shared a variation on the cake, so I made one - and very successfully too - it is easy to make and the girls have eaten half of it already!I shall have another go at the pumpkin cake since I have another can of it in stock, but perhaps not for a week or two, as I have put one in the freezer anyway. The cheap and cheerful cake will probably get made again at the weekend, as there was far too much icing for one cake, and the remainder is stashed in the fridge, waiting for another opportunity to decorate something nice!  Everything I need to make it is in stock and it really is cheap, and the girls' comments included, \"Amazing!\" and \"Brilliant cake!\" so it was a success all round."},

She wasn't sure of the name of the other one I chose, but said that it has a chestnut flavour. At that price, I thought it was worth a chance!I had a mooch around the internet when I got home, and apparently butternut will store for up to six months, if stored in a cool and dry place, so there is no rush to use them.  But I wouldn't have been able to pick up these bargains without a few pounds in my purse.  Around here, there are a LOT of people who sell veg from their gates, and it is reliably cheaper than the supermarkets. Extending my range of butternut squash recipes is going to be good, and cheap if it goes on like this!"},

We had a bring-and-share lunch, and there were 45 women there at one point [and one man, who did a lot of chattering and not a lot else]. The fellowship and creativity were great, and we are looking forward to doing it again at another chapel sometime after Easter. It was a lot of work on the tea-making front, but there was a good team to share the load.Off to consider a bible-study for tomorrow afternoon now - hope you have a lovely weekend xx"},

I bought a butternut squash on Monday and have made a curry and a stew with it. It cost me £1.90 as it was a fair size and it has been a significant part of 8 meals - so I was quite pleased with that.It started on Tuesday with a butternut squash/onion/potato curry [I cheated and used a jar of sauce from Aldi] which the EF girls loved. It had other veg in it, like carrots and spinach, and they ate their fill and then I put two more portions in the freezer.  Tonight, it has become a butternut and chickpea stew.  I always ask for feedback as I don't want to make them eat something again if they don't like it, so one said she liked it and one said she loved it - good to go again, then, I think.  Again, they ate a big portion each and there are two more in the freezer.I am really enjoying this \"bung more in the freezer\" strategy because it means that I get another night off in the future and will not have to cook from scratch - a really wise investment in time, I think! In between the two squash meals, they had a cheesy pasta and broccoli bake on Wednesday, which the YFG also enjoyed. She had the leftovers from that tonight as she is not keen on what she feels are \"too vegetarian\" meals, bless her!  It is certainly keeping costs down, so I am pleased with it. Tomorrow night is a \"with chips\" meal - the vegetarian will have a veggie burger and the others will have battered haddock. The best news - only 2 hours to do on the phone tomorrow and then I am done!  I think a small bottle of wine may get opened tomorrow evening....."},

My concern is that if all the stress of this makes her ill and she has to come home, the university will ask who she told, who she asked for help, where she went to chat with people, and whether she spoke to her doctor, for example.  They can't help her if they don't know she needs help, after all.Half of me wants to jump on a train to Aberdeen in the next couple of hours and go to sort it out for her, but the more sensible half is saying that no, she is 19 and she needs to grow through this and deal with it.  The less sensible half may win out in the end as I am still worried - I'll wave as I travel up the country if I do go!  I have already checked the train fares and timetables........there's a bus service from Dundee to Aberdeen because of a derailment of a freight train at Broughty Ferry.At least I can pray."},

I wish that the EFG had gone to uni in Norwich sometimes, but then I remember that no, the course which suited her best was in Aberdeen.Last night I spent three frantic hours worried half to death about her. One of her flatmates had had an episode of self-harming and quite terrifying behaviour and the other four girls, including the EFG, had fled from the flat in fear.  I had the EFG on the phone in tears, shaking and incoherent.  It was not a good place to be. In near constant communication with her and the other three, I encouraged them to ring the police for the other girl's safety, but they rang 111 and didn't get a lot of support. I tried all kinds of numbers in Aberdeen to find them some help, as it was getting late.  Eventually, I managed to prise the girl's home phone number out of them and I rang her mum, and explained the situation.  Of course, her poor mum then became as upset and worried as I already was, and managed to get a lift into Aberdeen, as she lives about an hour away.  She has taken her daughter home for a few days of R&R, and possibly a trip to the GP whilst she is home too.  All was well again by midnight and we settled down!Today I have had a lovely morning taking a service at one of my favourite chapels, and then I came home and charged up and down and round and round with my new lawnmower - it was great!  My headteacher came over this afternoon as we have a mini-crisis going on at school and she had been away with a group for a couple of nights and needed a catch-up.  Then, I waded through 5 years of old governor documents, looking for minutes and documents relating to a specific issue......I had a couple of cups of tea whilst I was doing that....Tonight - the fire is lit for the first time this season, and it is a lovely cheery sight......just in time for Downton Abbey in about half an hour.  Love it - a perfect end to the weekend!"},

It did make too much for the three of them for one dinner though, so they are happy to have it again tomorrow....I cooked 2 lbs of potatoes, grated about 3/4 of a pound of cheese [it suggested a whole pound!] and beat 2 eggs with a splash of milk.  I fried one onion in large rings, using a little oil. When the potatoes were cooked, I mashed them with a big knob of butter, and then beat in the egg/milk mixture, with a quarter of a teaspoon each of mustard powder and cayenne pepper.  The onion and most of the cheese went in at this stage, although I kept a little to go on the top. It had about 20 minutes in the oven on 180C and then I popped it under the grill to brown up a bit for the last 5 minutes.  The onion was not in the original recipe, but who has cheese and potatoes without an onion? I served it with lots of green veg and some carrots, and they soon cleaned their plates and had seconds.  The serving suggestion was to accompany it with bacon, mushroom, tomatoes and baked beans, which sounded more like brunch to me.  Maybe we'll try it that way another time.  However, this was was thrifty, vegetarian and filling, and made with ingredients I had to hand - a winner all round."},

I am not sure where she got the inspiration from, but those who ate it cleared their plates.  It is large pasta shells, filled with a lentil, tomato and onion mixture, put in a shallow dish on a base of cheese sauce and then a little more cheese sauce over it with a sprinkling of grated cheddar on the top.  It went in the oven for about 15 minutes and was served with some salad."},

There are plenty of people who can feed an adult on less than £15 a week, and regularly share their recipes and food plans on the MoneySavingExpert forums, and yet this family were spending nearly £100 a week per person, if you say that the adults were spending that and the small child was the £50. Blimey.  The presenters managed to find them loads of swaps which would save them about £8000 a year, which was the best result the programme had had so far, but actually, those who spend the most are the ones who can save the most, aren't they? The people who hold the record for losing the most weight are always the ones who had the most to lose in the first place, and it was the same with the spending here tonight.  The man of family was so relieved that this was going to take some of the pressure off him as the main earner, and I felt for him. On telling the YFG that I had resigned from the phone job by text this morning [she had gone to school by the time I did it], her response was charming, \"Oh mum, are we going to be poor now?\" to which I replied no, because I had done all the sums to ensure that we can manage on what I will earn at the church, and the other incomes we have.  Bless her, she did understand that it was better to have a little less but be well and healthy, rather than wearing myself out for only a little more.Friday again tomorrow - these Fridays keep coming, and I am reliably informed that after tomorrow, there are just 14 Fridays till Christmas....not sure I wanted to know that just yet!I've just done the deed and sent the email to the phone job boss to resign!I thought I had a plan in my head to carry on until Christmas, but the bags under my eyes and the lack of time I have had these past two weeks for my daughters has convinced me, along with a conversation I had with a stranger on Tuesday, that enough is enough.And I will have enough, my wise stranger's words convicted me.  So I hope that she will become a good friend in future, as I shall be spending more time in her church and I really valued the time I spent chatting with her on Tuesday.  So I have just lost some income, and some tax credits too, because my hours will now fall under the 30 limit, but we have enough to live on from other sources, and I feel like I really need to put my time and energy into the church work, which is my passion."},

They both headed out in different directions on the trains just after lunch, and the YFG went to the local town to go to Lidl and the library - a book I had ordered had come in and I was keen to get it picked up.  (image from amazon.com)I've been reading the \"Game of Thrones\" books, as they are popularly known: the EFG has the first two, but I have had to source all the others from the library.  I know that they have been made into a television series but I am not even considering watching that until I have read all the books!  I am enjoying them so far - although it is a challenge to remember who is who!I did manage to cut the front lawn in the sunshine when we got back, but the mower is making weird noises so I didn't strain it too much!  UJ has not brought the \"new-to-me\" mower over here yet and I think it is still at the works getting serviced, so I am still plugging away with the Flymo......for how long, I don't know!  The lawns are getting overlong in some places and I don't think that the Flymo will manage those bits now........a combination of having a lot of rain lately and meetings has meant that when I had time to cut it, it was too wet, and then when it was dry enough, I wasn't here - and that combination has been a bit of a disaster!  I may get a little more cut today if the weather holds out.I've tried to get the EF girls trained to do some of their own chores, so Thursday night I explained that I would need their bedding laundry first thing in the morning and with one gentle reminder, it all appeared in a basket on the landing.  They do need to remember to make their beds before they try to get in them though, as they were both struggling with duvet covers past 10 pm when they went up to go to bed on Friday night - whether they had forgotten or just left it until they went to bed, I don't know!  We had a \"you've been here two weeks, what do you think?\" review at dinner last night, and both seem happy with life here at the moment.  (image from telegraph.co.uk)Saved the best news for the last!  The YFG has been offered a Saturday job at John Lewis!  She had been offered one which was Friday nights and all day Sunday but we couldn't manage that because of transportation issues on Sundays out here in the middle of nowhere, so she declined that.  They seem quite keen on her though, as after two phone calls from them and us explaining the situation, they have altered the job offer - and she is over the moon!  We believe that it is just a temporary one, from the end of September to the end of January, but it will be an excellent start in the world of work.  She and I have agreed that at least half the wages will be going into savings - good to get her into the routine of savings from the start, I think, or the money would soon be spent!"},

To that end, I have realised that I have six days of holiday from the phone job to take and have pretty much organised with the boss to take almost every other Monday off between now and the Christmas holiday - that means that those weeks will only require 8 hours on the phone and leaves me with a little more breathing space in the schedule.  I shall decide between now and Christmas whether I shall go back to the phone job after Christmas, and if not, I shall give notice in time.  I am loving the social aspect of the new job - Tots groups, Knitting groups and drop in sessions all have plenty of tea on offer - and the serious side of the work is actually a joy alongside the new team with whom I am working - but I am the only one who can even remotely claim to be a Fenlander as the others are all northerners, and proud!Hopefully I will be back at the weekend - I have a lovely recipe for recycled shortbread that I used today and I even managed to take a couple of photos.  See you soon xxx"},
{"title": "Hard hearts", "date": "Saturday 5 September 2015", "text": "I could have cried yesterday when I went to the Worship Lunch at the chapel. I never actually participate in eating with the ladies as they always have soup and bread, then pudding and custard, and I prepare the food, serve it and wash up, since I can't eat any of the food.......but I always say the grace before they eat.Yesterday I thanked God for food, fellowship and friends, as I usually do, but then I asked them to think of others, of families desperate to reach safety and of children washed up on foreign shores. I said the \"Amen\" and walked back into the kitchen.  I could overhear the conversation at the table, and the eight older ladies were using words which really broke my heart there: \"too many foreigners here already\", Enoch Powell was mentioned in a favourable light, and the conversation went on for a little while about how immigrants would take \"our\" jobs and benefits.I was angry and did not know how to respond, and remembered that I was in church.Unfortunately, it seems to me that we have generations of British people who just don't consider what kind of a nation we are - we've been having other folks come here for hundreds of years, from the Romans, the Vikings and the Saxons for example, right through to people from former Empire countries and EU member states. There is a huge difference as well between an immigrant, who comes to seek a better kind of a life, and a refugee, who comes seeking Life itself.  And every one of the refugees who comes seeking Life should be given a chance to have it, not to lose it in a boat in the Mediterranean or in the back of a lorry in Austria. These are not people looking to be able to claim benefits and an easier life - these are human beings, like us, with families and friends and life stories, who are looking for a way to just stay alive.Seems to me that as much as we need to pray for people who are seeking life, we need to pray for attitudes to change across the world."},

The nights are drawing in, and the clock change is on the horizon. Harvest festivals abound.(image from kardsunlimited.com)August has been a busy time but we are ending it in a good way. The EF [Education First] girls are happy with their lot here: having heard dire stories of other host families, they are of the opinion that they have fallen on their feet. What they will make of the school will be another thing, but we are welcoming them, and enjoying their company. In a strange way, they make us better versions of ourselves, and that is good.  We have enjoyed long talks over dinner the last two evenings, and they have kept my girls off their laptops for hours, as they have been chatting away and exchanging stories, comparing lives and prices in their home countries - we are fast learning that Denmark is a very expensive place to live and they pay 50% income taxes!  I think the Danish girl is going to need another suitcase to take all her loot home with her as she wants to make the most of the good prices here - and her mum would like some golden syrup for her baking as it is hard to get hold of over there, she says!(image from theguardian.com)August has been wet, and the grass has grown like mad - my dad has finally rung up today and said that he knows that there is a petrol mower at UJ's house that was his [my dad's], and he will see if he can get it working for me - hooray!  It will beat all the huffing and puffing with the poor little electric one that I have at the moment.Finances always take a hit in the summer, and I have just paid £180 odd to BT for my annual line rental so that is another stone in the road - but at least it is paid for another year.  And it saves a bit.  I was too late on Saturday to share that the Lidl voucher was in the newspapers, or at least the ones which carry the Lidl News supplement.  I didn't read the paper and find it until Sunday!  There was £5 off when you spend £40 - BUT when I went in to spend mine today, I noticed that there are heaps of the little pamphlet as you exit the store, so perhaps you can pick one up if it would be helpful to you - it is valid until the 6th September.  I shall be back on the wagon, tracking spending like a hawk, and making every penny count. I hope to be able to make some serious savings this month, although I don't get the girls' food allowance paid until the very beginning of October, so it is paid in arrears.New job starts tomorrow - thanks for your good wishes - I shall report back!  Thank you xx"},

Just like that, and all by herself. We had the family who took her on holiday round to dinner on Friday night, and she wanted prawn cocktails, so she made them.  I thought she did rather well with those.

{"title": "Been a bit busy...again!", "date": "Thursday 27 August 2015", "text": "This feels like the last week of summer as we head back to school next week - that always seems to mark the beginning of autumn for me, whether it really is or not!  It is the last week where we are just the three of us, and then the dynamics are going to change again with the addition of the EF girls and the loss of the EFG back to Aberdeen at the end of next week.  It all feels like a bit of a whirlpool at the moment!Monday was the trip to Thetford, and then I worked most of Tuesday on the phone whilst the EFG went for her last food bank volunteering session and the YFG was painting, and then we went out when the EFG got home. We had to go to see my dad and MB - she has finally got the cast off her arm and the boot off her leg, so she is happier, although there is restricted movement in her arm and it is very swollen still. We spent about 90 minutes there, and then moved on to UJ's house: he is on holiday this week and my sister and I arranged to do his watering in his greenhouse between us. Tuesday was my turn.  The girls fell in love with a beautiful tortoiseshell cat which was having a snooze in the greenhouse when we got there and apparently lives a few doors down the road - there was talk of cat-napping which I had to put a stop to!!  I picked some Victoria plums off his three big old trees which are laden with plums this year - but no adventures with a ladder this time after I nearly fell off last year.After that, we continued our circuitous route and called in on step-son and his partner. He is glad to be home from prison but tethered to the house between 7pm and 7am by the tag on his leg - it did mean though that we could turn up there at 7.10pm and be sure that he would be in! I took him some tomatoes and runner beans and a courgette from our garden as well as a bowl of UJ's plums. He was grateful and loves fresh food like that - he does all the cooking!  We stayed there for about an hour and finally got home here at about 8.40pm. It was quite a trip but we got it all done.Yesterday I had a phone marathon session whilst the girls went off late in the morning. They had a bit of shopping to do, and they wanted to have a recce of John Lewis, where the YFG has a job interview this afternoon - they had to find the partners' entrance where she is to report, and also to check out the cafeteria, which is where the job is located. After a slice of carrot and pecan cake there, they were home just after 5pm.Any spare moments I have had this week have been spent knitting bunting for the EFG's room at uni as she decided she wanted some to put up there. I have so far \"bunted\" four pieces for her, and think I might manage a couple more before she goes back - one flew off the needles last night whilst I was watching the second of the \"Britain's Secret Spending\" programmes.  It was poignant that the very rich chap Anne Robinson interviewed often feels very sad, and has problems that money just can't solve.  I just cannot imagine having £90m to spend on a home!Today I have the final couple of hours work for the week to do on the phone, and some stuff to do in the EF girls' room [I think photos will be in order when it is done!] but we have to do some shopping tomorrow as we need lampshades for the donated bedside lights that we were given: unfortunately they came from a smokers' home and the lampshades were smelly, but the bases are fine as they are ceramic.  All afternoon I shall be keeping my fingers crossed for the YFG at her interview!"},

I managed to cut about half the grass yesterday before I collapsed in a heap and needed lots of very cold drink to revive me enough to some more. There are still two lawns to go but rain has stopped play at the moment.(image from forestry.gov.uk)Today the YFG and her friend have been to GoApe at Thetford Forest. The EFG and I were there too, but we were knitting in the car, and having the occasional mooch between the downpours, rather than getting drenched 40 feet up under the canopy of trees, harnessed to a safety wire [most of the time, although I am told there was a panic when they realised that the friend was not attached at one point] and doing Tarzan swings and zipwires.  I like solid ground too much to do all that.......scaredy cat, I know!  Typically, you might guess that there was a discount involved - as the YFG and her friend have both done the Duke of Edinburgh award, they were able to use their DofE cards to score a few pounds off their tickets!  Shame that we couldn't have foreseen the weather when we booked it.The landscape of The Brecks is quite different from the Fens, and it was a change to have alternative scenery for the drive over to Forest Lodge.  The Scots pine trees are everywhere, and make quite a contrast with the almost treeless [in some places] Fenland landscape.  Our days out are nearly at an end as the YFG starts back for Sixth form next week and the EFG returns to Aberdeen a week on Saturday.....we reflected whilst we were chatting this afternoon that they have had a good summer of days out and trips, as well as their weeks away here and there.  The family which took the YFG away to Northumberland are coming round to dinner on Friday evening and the EF girls will arrive Saturday morning, so the YFG and I are full steam ahead on their room this week, hoping to have it finished by Thursday night so that we can go shopping for something nice for dinner on Friday!  That invitation was a bit spur of the moment and not in the menu plan......spontaneity is fun occasionally."},

It was on BBC1 so you can still catch it on the iplayer if you are interested.  (image from bbc.co.uk)We immediately identified with the couple with four children [pictured above] who live on £25K in a thrifty manner, and could see how they did need to stretch their meals with pulses and rummage in charity shops.  There were comments about them spending 10% of their income on children's activities each year, and I think that I would have questioned that too - but each to their own. There were some spendy types, some of whom could afford it and others who couldn't.  I think my eyes would have popped out of my head if the checkout person had asked me for £1,300 as she did when one entrepreneur did a spot of clothes shopping with her stylist. The girls' eyes were really opened when Anne Robinson went to have a chat with the Baroness though, who came from a long line of aristocratic politicians - and I thought she was the bee's knees as they say - yes, she had antiques, but she had inherited them, and she wore \"posh\" clothes, but the outfit she wore to Baroness Thatcher's funeral was £16 from eBay - and she had lots of things she had found on eBay at very reasonable prices. She didn't give a hoot for labels, and put her Aldi coffee in a Fortnum's tin because she had been given the tin in the past and liked it - good for her!  She was down to earth and thrifty - dinner was pigeon her son had shot at the weekend, and she was making marmalade with an old pair of laddered tights......I thought that the programme was interesting and well-made. I have not been a fan of Anne Robinson but she was able to ask some very pertinent questions, and I shall have to try to remember to watch the second half of the programme next week."},

I have been given some huge fleece throws for the cost of a small donation to the chapel, and I have bought some new duvets and pillow packs in a half-price offer from Argos.  I have also been offered some bedside lights this week - hopefully the person who offered them will remember to actually give them to me!  I did accept the offer gratefully but I am aware that he said they were in his loft.....I have to take out a huge bookcase from the room and I am hoping that I might get that down tomorrow whilst UJ is here.  Not sure where it will go, yet, but I don't want to get rid of it as it is a floor-to-ceiling one which the FH made from good quality wood.  And I have plenty of books that I can put on it, that's for sure!The thing about all of this is that we have an eye on the future as well as to the present.  The house will need to be prepped for sale in less than two years' time, so we are regarding some of this as an investment in that process too - some of the walls haven't ever been touched in the 11 years we have been here....about time, I hear you say!"},

No!  Pop along to the local hardware/cheap shop and pick up a broomstick for 79p.  Does the job for a tenth of the price!I am 100% confident that the FH's son will be able to copy his father's method of fixing it to the wall and save me a fortune - thank goodness for inventiveness!I have also been wonderfully blessed this week with huge fleece blankets for the EF girls' beds. In the winter, we all have fleecey blankets or quilts on top of our duvets, and with the EFG taking her quilt off to Aberdeen, there wouldn't be enough for the girls as well.  A lady at the Knitting group brought two huge ones yesterday and I was given them in return for a small donation to the church - how kind, and just the thing I was lacking - but God knows every need, hey!  Things are coming together. I have had a meditative week so far, and transformed four chests of drawers, and an extra set of eight drawer fronts.  The chests were all this lovely shade of orangey pine but are no longer - thank goodness!The chests are all over 15 years old, and well travelled. This particular unit [below] had old parcel tape still stuck to it in places from where the FH taped the drawers shut when we moved here 11 years ago!  I did manage to get it off when I sanded the drawer fronts, which was a relief.I used chalk paint.  I had planned to use Elaine's recipe but hadn't got all her suggested ingredients. I had to substitute plaster of Paris for the tile grout, so I used this recipe.  It's brilliant what you can find on Pinterest....The recipe I used was usable for hours, and I even left one pot of it overnight [about 8 hours] with some clingfilm over it, and it was fine in the morning.This is what it looked like after only one coat - I ended up putting five or six coats on each piece, waiting for them to dry in between.  It built up to a lovely finish.And then I had to wax them.  Two layers went on, buffed with lots of elbow grease in between layers.  Speaking to the FH's son, he thought one layer would be fine, put on with a buffing brush on a drill, but when I pointed out that there was no buffing brush, just me and a soft cloth, he agreed that two would be fine.  I used Briwax, from a trader on Amazon.And this is what one of the finished products looks like - ready for the EF's girls' room. They have one each like this. I left the knobs as plain wood, and I love them.  So much so that I have done a five drawer chest for my room exactly the same!  The YFG has a three drawer chest which is wider than these, but the knobs on hers have been painted powder blue to complement her room.This is how I managed to paint the knobs - using an old plastic basket to poke them through on their screws and holding them as little as possible.And the total cost......about £8 for the wax.Magnolia paint, very old, about three inches in the bottom of a pot, left in the workshop - as good as freePlaster of Paris, left over from a kids' model making kit and languishing in the shed - no idea how much it was when it was new.....but it was not going to be used for anything else.Sandpaper - used an old sanding belt that the FH had had in the workshop - he had a collection of them in a drawer, and this was the scruffiest of them all and the least likely to be used by his son, I thought, so I tore it up and used it.I am chuffed that I have reworked four pieces of furniture and saved myself some pennies in the process as I needed to do something to make the furniture acceptable for visitors to use.  The YFG and I have both got \"new to us\" furniture in the bargain too."},

They are perhaps the worst courgettes I have ever had the misfortune to grow, and the leaves are covered in this horrible black stuff, which UJ reliably informs me is the poo of some insect. Lovely. The courgettes themselves are edible, but strangely bumpy.The Ferrari French/dwarf beans are doing well and I had a good harvest off them today. A little sit in the sun armed with a pair of scissors and they were topped and tailed and ready for storage in the fridge [for this week] and the freezer [for the winter].  We do have wildlife in the garden - some of it pretty!Tomatoes ripening up nicely. Probably Gardener's Delight but UJ gave me the plants and he couldn't quite remember. They taste good!Peppers in the greenhouse. A dozen plants from Aldi, growing well. Three large peppers are already in the fridge and there are more coming along beautifully.Raspberries continue to ripen.  We lost a lot in the damp weather as they just rotted off before we could pick them but these look like they will make it from plot to plate nicely!A few self-seeded runner beans are winding their way around the old swing frame again. The ones I actually planted around a wigwam are not doing quite as well - typical.......These are six really special tomato plants. They were self-seeded from some tomato plants I had in one of the veg beds last year. UJ potted up these plants and put them in the greenhouse until they got big enough to put out and now they are flourishing.  They were Sweet Million, I think.And my gorgeous sweet peas.  I have to go out there to inhale their lovely scent several times a day.  Love it!"},

{"title": "End of the month offers", "date": "Tuesday 28 July 2015", "text": "Well, not so much offers as temptations, I think.  I have noticed over the last couple of months that around this time, my internet pages are littered with advertisements for \"payday weekend\" offers in the shops.  It seems that the retailers realise that most of the month, people are being quite careful about s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g every penny but they hope that when the bank accounts are topped up with the wages, they might hope to part us from some of that hard-earned cash with a tempting treat or two!We aren't falling for it here, and I doubt that you are, too, if you are the kind of person who comes to read my ramblings!I said yesterday what a spendy month we have had, but every expense has been planned for or seen coming!  When I look back at the month, I have spent a heck of a lot of money [for me] but it has been careful spending, not treat spending and certainly not reacting to some adverts!For example, the oil purchase was done after careful monitoring.  Monitoring of the usage of the oil in the tank, so that I knew how much we were using each month, and was able to roughly estimate when we would need more.  We don't actually Need more yet, as I would estimate that there is still about eight  months' worth of oil in the tank at summer usage rates, but we are coming towards the autumn and winter when usage will increase, and we have to also keep an eye on the cost of the oil itself.  I'd been tracking the prices, and was confident that the prices were good enough to make the purchase now. They may still drop further, but being of a cautious nature, I was satisfied that they were low enough!There is no way that I would have just got up one day and said, \"Hey, let's order some oil!\" the way that the advertisers seem to expect us to say, \"Hey, let's spend a grand on a new sofa!\"Planning, tracking, monitoring, saving - some of my favourite words!!  These are the words that are keeping us out of the red and firmly in the black."},

Frugal? Yes - more showers and less baths, I hope, and the money has been set aside for some time, so no debts incurred in the process.  He is taking the water from the hot tank so there is no expensive mile of cable to wire in an electric shower either. I had to take the Skoda for its MOT this afternoon.  It passed - thank goodness - but the mechanic did make a comment about the miles on the clock: over 165000!  She's going very well and all he could find fault with is some corrosion on the silencer, and some weird wear on one of the tyres, which I shall get checked out this week at the local garage. (image from powerflex.co.uk)Frugal? Yes - keeping her going another year is saving me money yet again!  This lovely old banger is doing remarkably well for her age, and mileage, and I shall do whatever it takes to look after her and keep her on the road for another year. I had the cam belt changed in January and we think she's good for another few years at least.  I feel safe in her, which is worth a lot to me.I dropped the car off and walked the half mile into town and I spent 95p on a stamp to send in the girls' bus pass applications.  And that is all.  I actively avoiding mooching around the shops by going in to the library and reading for half an hour - and then I picked up two books to check out and bring home to read for the week.Frugal?  Not spending money and then borrowing two books from the library? How could it be anything else!Supper is all thought out too - beans fresh from the garden and corned beef hash.  Tinned tomatoes from the stores, onion, pepper from the greenhouse, potatoes from the garden.  Home-grown less only metres from the stove so it has got to be fresh and frugal!I am looking forward to the end of this month as it has been an extraordinarily spendy month and I am planning on a super-saving August!"},
{"title": "Money to burn", "date": "Sunday 26 July 2015", "text": "I don't like seeing my money go up in smoke, so the news that home heating oil had hit a five year low, according to Boilerjuice, was fantastic news.  I can remember paying over 60p a litre for the precious stuff, in the past!  (image from mkoilboilers.co.uk)This week, the price dropped to around 32p a litre, so it was time to stock up!  I have been watching the prices tumble for sorme weeks and day after day, the price had dropped. Then, it seemed to start to waver, with some days' prices being higher than the day before, so I decided to bite the bullet and order 1000 litres.  I also told an older lady at church about it last night - she doesn't use the internet and when she runs her oil down, she just rings up and gets more delivered, so I thought it was worth mentioning it to her. She didn't think she had room in the tank for her usual 800 litres, so I did encourage her to think about getting 500 litres whilst the prices are low.  She was glad I had told her, so I was pleased I had thought to mention it to her.  I know that she doesn't haggle with the oil company the way I do because she hasn't got the ammunition from the internet, so she just pays whatever they quote - whereas I saved £30 on the original price that the local company quoted by being able to say what I could get it for from elsewhere.(image from telegraph.co.uk)We have lots and lots of wood stacked up in the woodshed and the workshop - the \"proper\" logs are in the woodshed and the rougher stuff which is chopped up bits and pieces and pallets, is in the workshop. The rough stuff gets the fire going and then the proper logs hold the fire in, especially if we are nipping out for an hour or two, or I want to keep the fire in longer overnight, perhaps to get some washing dry.  The good stuff cost me £80 for a load earlier in the year, and there is still half a load of last year's there, so we will be using that first.  We don't stack it around the wood burner like this picture, though!  Next thing will be to organise the chimney sweep for the annual brush-out of the flue.  That was £30 last year, so I am hoping that that cost hasn't gone up too much either.  Got to be done, though.The realisation that it will be August next week makes me wonder where time is going but I do like Autumn, so I am sort of looking forward to September in a way!  However, I am trying to make the most of Summer whilst it is here, and I am looking forward to all the flowers opening on my sweet peas this week and putting on a good display!  Hope you all have a blessed Sunday xx"},
{"title": "Our weekend away", "date": "Friday 24 July 2015", "text": "This write up has been a long time coming, as I have had to wait for the EFG to download and send me the pictures from her camera, and then we had to negotiate who was going to use which photos on which media sites, which then left me with a few to choose from!  The EFG shares some on FB with her friends, whereas the YFG puts hers on Instagram.  You get to see my choices here!We spent a lot of the mornings watching these little chaps charging around the area, nicking the toast that the neighbours had put down for the birds, and being generally very inquisitive! The caravan park is beautiful, and the YFG and I went for a walk on the Saturday afternoon, when we were lucky enough to get a glimpse of a muntjack deer in the undergrowth. Sadly, by the time that the YFG had got the camera out and worked out how to get the lens cap off, it had jumped off into deeper cover!  The squirrels just seemed to love to pose in contrast to the more timid deer.We went to Sheringham on Saturday, and enjoyed mooching around the shops and what was left of the market by the time we got there. I bought a couple of cheap secondhand novels to read, and the girls bought odds and ends.  We headed along the coast road to Cromer later on, and nipped into Morrisons for provisions as the shop on the site is rather expensive.  Sunday morning we didn't move very quickly at all and it was lunch time before we got going!  We went back to Cromer and walked around, and got caught in a rainstorm on the pier.  I had a lovely chat with a lady with two small children as we hid from the rain under some cosy shelters on the pier. She was telling her children that they probably wouldn't go to the beach baptisms that night if the rain carried on, so I thought I would ask a couple of questions about that - full immersion baptism in the sea sounded exciting!  It turned out that she and the family had just moved to Cromer in April, and only from Peterborough - they loved Cromer so much and were spending so much time there that they thought they would move there!  What a great sense of adventure.  The children were excited to be living right by the beach and having their first holiday-at-home by the sea!  I have to say that I was a tiny bit jealous....After the rain eased off a little, we went back into the town towards Mary Jane's fish and chip shop - the best in Cromer.  The YFG had the traditional fish and chips but the newly vegetarian EFG had to settle for onion rings and chips.....An evening back at the caravan and we all settled down to relax.  The EFG and I both did some knitting whilst we were away, and I read some books - it was very relaxing, and I loved it!  I can completely understand the lure of the holiday home industry there as I would snap up a country retreat by the sea if I could afford to buy it, and had the time to nip away a couple of weekends every month.  Not at the moment though!  Now that we know that the site caravans are so well maintained and reasonably priced out of season, as well as having secured information about the one that my Dad and MB had stayed in, we shall definitely be going back.  Highly recommended x"},

She needed a job to make ends meet, and was the only applicant who turned up to the interview for a position as a postie, so she got the job.  The three books tell the story of how she and her husband, Ben, settled into life in Cornwall, and the ups and downs of rural life.  They are well written and tell a gentle story - full of humour and kindness.  As I finished each one, I couldn't wait to start the next, and now that I have read all three, I am looking around and wondering whether she has written any more - but unfortunately, it seems not!  Her endearing stories of making a penny do the work of a pound and getting used to getting by on much less do hit the mark, and I was impressed with her determination to fit in and get on with the job at hand. Tessa Hainsworth has a website HERE which tells you more about her and her life, and also links to some more wonderful photos.  I was fortunate to get these three books in a bundle from The Book People for just £4.99 and I consider that money well spent for my holiday reading, but perhaps you will find them in the library.  I'd highly recommend them - and although I have mentioned that book shop several times in this post, this is NOT a sponsored post, because I don't do them!"},

Our friends kindly left a hosepipe reel out for us for when the water butts were emptied, but sadly, nothing to attach the hose to the tap with, so we shall have to persevere with the cans........more exercise for us, which is fine in this lovely weather.Dad took MB to the hospital for a scan this morning and that all went well - they were home again by 9.30 am and very pleased at how smoothly it all went.

There was a good turnout at the service, of people from our own chapel in the village and folk from about six other chapels in the circuit as well. It was lovely to see our wee chapel so filled with people, and we sang our hearts out. It was good.  My dad managed to come along for the service, although he didn't stay long afterwards, because he wanted to get home to MB.  UJ and my sister came along, as did the YFG, which I was pleased about. Today, we have a christening at the chapel, and then we will be taking some friends and going this afternoon to a leaving service for one of the circuit ministers.  He is off to London [or just outside, I think] in his next appointment, so there is a special time this afternoon for sharing with him and his family, and I think that people from his last place are also coming - they had a fantastic choir which came when he arrived, too - so it is going to be a sad event, in that he will be leaving us, but also very joyous as I know that the music and prayers and singing will be filled with the Spirit. We've loved the chap at our chapel, but I know that he hasn't got on as well with every congregation, unfortunately. I shall almost be glad to get back to work on Monday for a rest!  But then the EFG will be back from her Latitude adventures and we shall have tales to hear from there - the text messages are not telling half the story, but I am getting a picture of sunburn [she left her sunhat here], people getting drunk [\"we carried a paralytic girl to the welfare tent\"] and dodgy hygiene [\"I've managed to have a shower at last\"]........Her big brother seems to think that festivals are a good life experience but they have come on a lot in many respects since he and a few mates organised one with rock royalty in the dim and distant past!"},

I first mentioned the church job back in February and I haven't actually explained much more about it since then, although folk have been very supportive and encouraging.The circuit are employing two lay workers to help with outreach and I have been blessed with one of the positions.  I am sure that I shall be telling you much more about it once I actually start it in September!   (image from amara.com)In the meantime, I have today negotiated a reduction in my phone hours from 15 to 10 from the middle of August after I have a week off, which has been booked since January. It will allow me some breathing space to get some work done around the house and get straightened out for when the students arrive at the end of August.  Ten hours can be quite easily done over about three days if necessary so it will allow me a little bit more flexibility than fifteen does at present.The YFG and I have been to the cinema this afternoon to see True Story - which is a bit strange but very absorbing, and more than a bit mysterious.  We sat in a cinema which would have held probably 150 or so people - and there were 6 of us in there!  Plenty of room to spread out, for sure.....That was the YFG's treat whilst the EFG is away.  We have heard from her a couple of times, but she has limited access to electricity at Latitude, so she is conserving her phone battery and just texting occasionally.  We've heard from her today and all is well.I know that it is getting late, but now that the temperature has cooled down, I am off to do some baking for the table top sale that we are having at the chapel tomorrow afternoon, and for the refreshments after the service in the evening.  Lemon cake, chocolate slab cake and some cheese scones, I think.  Hope you all have a lovely weekend x"},

There might just be time in the midst of it all for a meal or two, but not a lot else.  Ahead of the weekend, I have to source more communion glasses as we are expecting more people to the recognition service than our church has glasses to accommodate - but then we do only have about 20 these days - and might need to make a trip to borrow some from another chapel.  And then there is the baking for the table top sale's refreshments, and digging out some \"stuff\" to sell to support the cause.......I am SO glad that we had last weekend.  It was a peaceful, quiet, relaxing, mooching-about with no fixed plans kind of time, and involved lots of sitting around, sleeping, wandering around familiar places, and no deadlines, urgency or hassle.  We took some great photos of squirrels which came to visit the caravan too, but they are on the EFG's pc and she's gone off to Latitude festival as a volunteer now, so I shall have to wait until next week to show you those.  We thought one or two might be suitable to submit to the Countryfile calendar competition - we are rather impressed with the EFG's new camera!We were so impressed with the caravan and just being at Kelling Heath last weekend again that the YFG would like to go back with her friend, and I have said that I will do what I can to fulfill that wish one day - perhaps not this year though.  A little savings pot will have to be set up to keep some \"holiday fund\" money building up in, as for now, I have other expenses staring me in the face!We need to have a refill of the oil tank [approx £350], I am waiting for the plumber to come back to me with an installation date for the over-bath shower [about £350-£400] and I need to pay for the YFG's school bus pass [£480] this month too.  Seems funny that although the kids are supposed to stay in full time education, we still have to pay for post-16 transport, even to their nearest post-16 education centre.....so you can see that we are having to keep a tight rein on the pennies at the moment with all that to sort out.  I haven't heard from the plumber for some time, so I shan't complain if that moves over into August!"},

Dad fetched her home this afternoon.  She's feeling a bit groggy and the pain is still rough but she is managing.  I had a quick word with her on the phone tonight and she seems relieved to be back home, which is always where we want to be!  I also think she wants to keep an eye on Dad as she was worried about the strain all this had put on him.  She's got to go back to the clinic in a couple of weeks to have it checked over again but they are not anticipating any problems.  Thank goodness!  She still has the big boot on her foot to support the broken bone there as well, so she is a bit of a walking wounded type at the moment, but she is quite positive about it all, bless her xx"},

Her arm is more painful but she feels able to manage the pain.  MB sounded in good spirits when I spoke to her on the phone twice yesterday.  She has an appointment to go to the fracture clinic in two weeks to see how things are healing.  Otherwise, all is well - her daughter has got them some shopping in, and my dad had a long nap in the afternoon and was feeling more rested.  I think some quiet days are on the cards for them this weekend.My interview seemed to go OK. The panel didn't give a lot away whilst I was doing the presentation but I did get some more positive feedback from the minister on the panel later on. They asked some interesting questions, which were quite challenging to answer - I shall have more empathy with the teachers and teaching assistant candidates I interview at school in future now!  The other candidate had come from some distance and is moving closer to the area this week, but won't actually live within the circuit.  Thank you for all your prayers and support - I shall tell you the outcome as soon as I know.And today we are off to the coast for the weekend - and I am very very ready for a break!  I'll be back after the weekend - we do not think we will have internet access whilst we are away, so it is likely that we'll just read, relax and potter around in real life!  I hope you all have a good weekend, and I'll catch up on your blogs next week too xx"},

He took MB out to lunch yesterday and she took a tumble on some steps in the hotel that they had gone to for lunch, and she was injured.  Paramedics took her to Cromer hospital, and then released her to come home, as long as she was taken in to the local hospital where they live.  Dad drove her home and they arrived back at about 8pm last night. One of her daughters has gone over to help Dad to look after her, and to take her to the hospital this morning, as the hospital here did not want them to take her last night. She is very shaken up, and has hurt her ankle, her head and her elbow as she fell. Dad is 86 and she is a decade younger.  He is shaken by it all and exhausted by a two hour drive last night to get her home. They had been intending to share the driving but of course she was not able to help him.They abandoned the caravan and their belongings, just calling in there to pick up Dad's medications, so we need to sort out picking up their things when we are there at the weekend, but that is a minor point.  I am so hoping that MB will be OK, and that the hospital can patch her up and sort out her problems today.  I have promised to ring Dad tonight after I get back from the interview, to see how she is and what has happened.Blogger isn't playing ball this morning or I would have shared some pictures from the camp site that I have taken in the past.  There are some in the link above so you can see how peaceful it is there!  We are looking forward to a relaxing weekend but we will be thinking about Dad and MB too."},

I will be asking to go on a CAP money course if I get this outreach worker position in the church, so that I can help people more.  I would love to help more people access wonderful, helpful websites like Frugal Queen, Life after Money and Moneysavingexpert.  I can go down on my knees and pray for all kinds of people all over the world who do not have enough.  I'm grateful for the blessings we have too."},

We found out the depth of the love and support of others by which we are upheld.We still miss him.We are looking forward to the future.  We still have plans for moving forward, moving on, making strides towards another future, perhaps a bit different from the one we thought we had back then.  The FH died believing that the YFG had plans to be a midwife, perhaps, for example but now she has moved from science/medical ideas to anthropology.......the EFG is considering a fifth year at uni in order to spend a year abroad, and we are opening our home in September to EF students. In some ways we are going forward but in other ways we are going full circle, back to the hosting of horticultural/vocational students we did back in Cupar!  We give thanks for the memories, for the skills he taught us, the wisdom he shared with us, and the love he gave us.  In his death, we have become more confident, more determined, better team players, more reflective about how we are treated by others, and more aware of the opportunities we have. We look forward to what the next year might bring."},

Choosing a sixth form college has got so many challenges that I think that the YFG would almost rather someone took the decision out of her hands, but no way!  She has to make her own plans, and this is as good a place to start as any. She had a fantastic prom last Friday night - she looked lovely, and had a trip in a limo all the way to the venue [shame about coming home in a beat up old Skoda but I joked that the carriage had turned into a pumpkin!] and had a great time with her friends......we did NOT go down the route of spending a fortune, though, as you know us better than that.  The dress was a £50 long affair from the Asos website - she ordered three, one after the other, and we sent each one back until she fell in love with the one she wore.  She bought some high heels in nude, and a gold clutch bag, which will be useful to use again for another event - and I hope she gets more wear out of the dress too, for that matter.  One of her friends spent approaching £500 on her dress and I was shocked!  This was a Year 11 prom, for goodness' sake, not a wedding........sanity and reason and proportion seem to have gone out of the window for some people.  And that dress definitely was not ten times better than the YFG's although it did have more sequins.I am waiting to hear whether I have been shortlisted for interview for the church job: closing date was today so I have got my fingers crossed.  Will let you know if I hear anything - the interviews will be next Thursday, so I hope I get the chance to go!And the weather!  \"Scorchio\" seems to be the new word for describing this heat wave weather we are having here.  I think that the mercury got up to 27C here today - probably a bit higher but I didn't spend long enough in the car to check and that is the only place I see the temperature!  The YFG has turned down a planned trip to Lincoln uni tomorrow with the school as she didn't fancy 4 hours in a tin box [coach] sweating, for about four hours walking around the university, sweating, in the sun.  I took the EFG to Lincoln to an open day and have agreed that I will take the YFG it it turns out to be somewhere she would like to consider - but not tomorrow.  They apparently don't do an anthropology course, so she may not be that interested in the place anyway.

{"title": "Food banking", "date": "Thursday 4 June 2015", "text": "The EFG toddled off on the train Tuesday morning to go one of the Fens food banks, and what an eye opening day she had. There was a clear lack of communication to start with, as the only address she had been given was one of the venues where the food is actually distributed, so she turned up there at the appointed time, to find the place deserted.  Thinking wisely, she went to a local church cafe in the town and made some enquiries there, and was directed to another venue about half a mile away, where the food is actually stored and sorted.  So she arrived there half an hour late to a cheery lady saying, \"Oh, you found us then!\" to which my sassy teenager wanted to reply, \"Well, no thanks to you lot!\" but held her tongue, thank goodness.She did two shifts, to make the train fare worthwhile since she had to travel at a peak time and couldn't therefore use her Young Person's Railcard, and had two sets of people with her over the two shifts.  She reports a lot of tin-shuffling, from this box to that and back again as people could not decide, for example, whether pork and beans was a \"meat\" or a \"vegetable\" and whether condensed milk was a \"pudding\" or an \"extra\" - and she noticed that people in the second shift reversed decisions that the first shift had made, which made for a lot more re-jigging of stuff! The food bank depot actually supplies several distribution centres so there was a lot of stuff coming and going, since it seems that the distribution points don't store the food and it all has to be taken in and brought out again each time.  A lady in a van does all this picking up and dropping off each time.The EFG is an organiser, and likes to be efficient, so all the tin-shuffling frustrated her, and the reversing of decisions made her fume when she got home!  She will continue, and reflect on the lot of the volunteer in these situations.  I am going to give her some money next week to buy some bits and pieces in the local shop on the way to the food bank so that she can make a donation there on our behalf, so she will be sussing out what they are short of next week so that our contribution is of things that they need - she reports that there can't be a lot of tea left in China as most of it is there!There is another food bank more locally that she is investigating to help out at on another day, so we will see what her experience is like there."},

I now just have one more trial service to take at the end of June, in the presence of a minister and a preacher, and if they are happy, I am there.Now, don't get confused - this is the course and practicalities which surround the Local Preacher appointment which I have been studying for for the last five years. It is nothing to go with the lay ministry assistant job which has still not been advertised.  That's a different story.....one we'll get to when the powers that be get the contracts and job description ironed out.  Hopefully that will happen in June.It's been another full day here - I did an extra hour of overtime this afternoon, more than I had planned to do today, but it was bucketing down the rain this morning and I knew that the garden would be too wet to do what I had hoped, so I thought I might as well earn a few more pounds, and do the gardening tomorrow.  Once I had finished work, we went off to town to spend the Lidl voucher and stock up the fridge.  I also bought some spinach seeds as the EFG is eating it daily: it is not cheap and so I thought I had better grow some!  We're all sorted now for the week ahead. Tomorrow is a house and garden day - so I had better get up a little earlier than I did today...Have a good weekend, wherever you are xx"},

{"title": "Welcome home", "date": "Sunday 24 May 2015", "text": "The EFG almost fell off the train yesterday under the weight of the enormous rucksack she was carrying, as well as trying to lug along the two huge suitcases.  Good job she was not flying home as she would certainly have exceeded the baggage allowance......and when she got home, the suitcases seemed to \"pop\" all over the sitting room floor as she was unpacking and pulling things out to show me.  Never mind, we can find homes for everything as we go. She didn't bring home much washing as she had done it all in her laundry room there, where they have driers - such hardship it is going to be here for her without a drier!  She had me laughing though - she has brought the rails from her airer home as they wouldn't fit in the storage box, although the concertina ends did fit - so the rails are here and the structure is there!  I was so pleased that she had found time to nip to Hobbycraft in Aberdeen and find me a couple of balls of Regia sock wool so that I am nearly all set to start my sock knitting experience - the Sockalong lady recommends a short circular needle, so I just have to find one of those now as all the local shops in town yesterday only had long ones.  One scarf is finished, so just one more to complete and then I am going to start on the socks.The EFG has a terrible cough, and has been tossing and turning all night.  I think we might need to get to the shop today for some medications.  She had cough mixture in Aberdeen but didn't bring it home......too much to carry!The YFG had an interesting evening last night at Islington Town Hall, where she went to an author event with my sister.  Bobfest is all about the cat which helped author James Bowen get his life back together. The event was about raising money for The Big Issue.  She wasn't quite sure what to expect but it wasn't what she thought it would be - we were expecting the author to speak, and she had hoped to see the cat!  But the author seemed to be very shy and didn't say much at all, just signed copies of his book, and the cat was not in attendance at all.  The YFG was overwhelmed at the fans who had come from Finland, China and Brazil [that she knows of] to the event, and their enthusiasm for the cat and the writer!  She said that the term, \"crazy cat lady\" took on a whole new meaning for her last night.All a bit of a different experience from our simple village life with Shadow!  The YFG came home and said she didn't like the way London smells.........what can I say to that?!"},

(image from en.wikipedia.org)I'm off to gym this morning but I am not sure I shall be much use - I was there last night but just made the tea and supervised kids to the toilet down the hall as I couldn't actually coach.  It seems to be a quiet weekend anyway, with a lot of people away for the bank holiday or even for the whole week for half term, so hopefully there won't be too many kids there this morning!  A hot bath in a minute might help loosen the stiff muscles, I hope...And there is gardening to be done, so I'm planning on keeping moving around, however slowly.  Hope you have a good weekend xx"},

Just today to get through before the YFG gets a break from school for a week, and I get a day off work on Monday - and I am very ready for it again.  I have other holiday booked during the year, but there are 6 days left available to me to book, and I can't decide how to take them yet!  I've got a week booked already in August, and the l-o-n-g stretch from then until the Christmas break might be just the time to take a few more days off, except that I cannot take them in the October half term as we have to share out the allocation of school holidays, and I have already got my share of those.   So I am probably going to take them in the Autumn - but as a whole week, or perhaps two blocks of three days or even three blocks of two days added to a weekend........too many possibilities!If anyone is wondering about the OTHER job in the church, it has still not been advertised, so that is no further advanced at this stage.  Apparently, we have to wait for the powers-that-be higher up in the chain to agree the job descriptions and contracts, so these things are taking much more time than had been anticipated.  The local minister is quite upset about it all because he had wanted the lay workers in post in June......I don't see that happening at this rate!Best be off to potter my way through the day - work, chatting at chapel at the knitting club for half an hour, gymnastics tonight, Sainsbury's delivery coming tonight, and a rummage in the freezer for some supper - have a good day!"},

I shall meet her off the train later on Saturday afternoon.....whilst the YFG is off on a trip with my sister to London to an event all about Streetcat Bob.  I know very little about it, save that my sister bought the tickets for a surprise for her husband and then found out he had a prior engagement and couldn't go with her - so the YFG gets a well-deserved trip out.  Nose back in the books after the weekend though - still more exams to go.(image from dailymail.co.uk)"},
{"title": "Teaching", "date": "Wednesday 20 May 2015", "text": "Do some parents teach their children about managing money at all?  Or should I put it another way - do some parents not allow their children to learn about managing money?  Heard about a student this week who pays all her loan/grant to her parents and they add a little to it, and then give her an allowance each week......drip feeding her enough for one week at a time.If this student has a history of being very stupid with money, I can see their point.  But for most, I think that they need to learn how to manage funds themselves.  The EFG has full control of her dosh, although I have sat with her a couple of times to discuss her budget and how to work out how much she might need to allocate to different budgets, and whether she is getting a good rate of interest on her savings account.  I have looked at accounts with her and weighed up the pros and cons of taking a special student account, or staying with the account she opened here a few years ago - we came to the conclusion that the main benefit to compare the student accounts against was the overdraft fees and since she didn't plan on needing an overdraft, that would be irrelevant.  Then we compared free gifts, and railcards seemed to feature heavily in that category - we had already bought a three year one and got a good discount, so that wasn't much of an attraction either - so we concluded that she might as well stay where she is!We have an open relationship when it comes to talking about money - she told me how she had spent £60 on a pair of Doc Marten shoes, and I opened and closed my mouth like a fish a few times!  We've chatted about the best bargains in Lidl and Sainsbury's and which give the best coupons - and where to save cash.  She meal plans very well, and has done me proud. I have hopes of her coming home a little earlier than expected as she is not well and I really want her home NOW!  She's got to work a few things out with her friends about storage, but I am keeping everything crossed that she pulls it off so that she can come home and collapse."},
{"title": "Tears today", "date": "Tuesday 19 May 2015", "text": "It seems that everywhere I have been on the internet today has sparked tears in me today.  I started off reading how John's condition has deteriorated at The Barefoot Crofter and it made me weep to think of his family because it reminded me of our journey here, and I know some of how they might be feeling now, and in the days ahead.  I've added them to my prayer list at home.And I have read and re-read and read again Ann Voskamp's heartbreaking post at A Holy Experience about Love and what these women, our sisters, are going through in Iraq.  She always makes me think, and challenges me to pray, to believe and to act in faith.  I have done what I can tonight, but if you can't donate, then please pray or do what you do, for these women and their children.  We might live in a different world when we read how they are suffering there, but they are about 3,500 miles from the UK.  I don't expect to have to read about women and children living in those kinds of conditions in 2015, sleeping in a metal shipping container with no running water, no sanitation and little hope, having run from their homes in fear.  Having to choose which of their children to take with them, burying their children on a mountainside because they died from hunger and thirst.  The tears brim again now as I think of this.  And look at those photos - those are women just like you and I.  Children just like ours, full of expectation and hope, children who should be able to grow up in safety.  Just tucked the YFG up in her bed, snug under her duvet and safe in her own room, fresh from the bath and in clean clothes.  Hugged her extra hard tonight.  Counting our blessings."},
{"title": "Free from choc bun recipe", "date": "Monday 18 May 2015", "text": "Because I love these chocolate buns, I must keep the recipe somewhere safe [here!] so that I can make them again!Heat the oven to GM4, 180C and line a 12 hole muffin tin with paper liners.Break three eggs into a bowl, and add 160g caster sugar. Beat with a hand held electric mixer for about 5 minutes until it is all frothy and light: when you lift the beaters out of the mixture, you should be able to make trails of batter across the mixture.  Add half a teaspoon of vanilla essence to the mixture.  Grate 50g peeled courgette in to the mix, with half a teaspoon of baking powder and 180g gluten-free flour, and 2 tbsp cocoa powder.  Gently fold all of this into the mix until it is completely incorporated, and then measure out tablespoon fulls of it into the paper liners.  Use up all the mixture across the liners until they are all evenly filled.  Bake for about 20 minutes until risen and beautiful!I used Dove's Farm plain white gluten-free flour, because that is what I had in the cupboard!  I think the mixture would have taken up to three times as much courgette, but that was all I had left......When they are baked to perfection and cooled, I frosted them with a chocolate buttercream made from Vitalite [dairy-free], cocoa powder and icing sugar.  I didn't weigh any of it!  There was about one and a half tablespoons of Vitalite, but could have done with less as I have loads left.  I know I added about a tablespoon of cocoa....but as for the icing sugar - well, I start slowly and just keep adding it a little at a time until I get the right consistency and it doesn't taste of margerine - not a very scientific method but it tastes good.Apart from the one I decorated with the mint and raspberry, I am eating them just as they are, but if you had any dairy-free chocolate buttons [I know such things exist], perhaps one of those plonked on the top of each one would finish them off nicely - the raspberries tasted great too though, and raspberry with chocolate is a great combination. I shall definitely be making these again, and perhaps experimenting with some other flavours too.I should say that this recipe was inspired by one by Harry Eastwood in her book, Red Velvet and Chocolate Heartache.  I made her American Vanilla Cupcakes several times, and they are stunning.  But this recipe is only inspired by that one - I've used more eggs, less courgette, different flour, less baking powder, no salt and less vanilla essence, and changed the flavour completely to chocolate.  I don't think she's got much competition from me, really...."},

There are so many photos and instructions on the website that I can't imagine getting lost.  It looks great - and there is also an accompanying Facebook page where you can ask other sock-knitters for advice, which seems to be a great combination!  The website is at www.winwickmum.blogspot.com.And then there is a recipe and a handy conversion site I have found. Ree Drummond, aka Pioneer Woman, posts some great recipes, and I have a daughter with a bit of a thing for chocolate chip cookies, so these gorgeous looking creations are going on the \"to-bake\" list this week.....I just had to work out how much a \"stick\" of butter was, and that was where this conversion site came in.  That link will take you straight to the section for butter.  A \"stick\" of butter is apparently 4 ounces.For those of us who want to be able to do more with our slow-cookers than just the odd stew or casserole, I found this post full of links, and I think that some of them might be worth having a go at - there are lots of chicken recipes, which I love, so I shall put those top of my list!I have continued my decluttering this week - we have taken a very old [pre-2000] Dell computer, complete with an enormous old monitor, to the skip.  We were advised to remove the hard-drive and \"smack it with a hammer\" before chucking it, so the YFG and I had great fun hitting it rather hard with a hammer last night on the gravel out the back.  We then left it on the driveway overnight as it began to smell a little strange and we thought it best to leave it out there.  I also offloaded an old tv that had a VCR in the bottom of it, a broken shredder, an old handmixer that burned out, and some old sofa cushions and an ancient duvet.  A skirt suit and a couple of winter coats went to the charity shop. I was quite pleased with that haul for the week.This afternoon, I have mown the grass.  Not the new turf, but just the previously-existing lawned area.  Thinking about how long that took, and looking at the expanse of the new sections, sheep are beginning to look like an attractive option ;)Hope you are having a good weekend xx"},

{"title": "The Other Half", "date": "Thursday 14 May 2015", "text": "The television has become such a low priority for me these days that I frequently forget to watch programmes that I had previously thought would be worth viewing. Consequently, I missed the last Vera, forgot about Safe House half way through, and still haven't seen anything of the new Home Fires series.(image from theguardian.com)I did manage to watch \"How the other half eat\" on the on-demand system for Channel 4 on the tablet earlier this week, just because I was feeling nosy as to how they made the programme.  It was an interesting twist that the ones eating all the junk and ready meals were the mega-rich family, spending £300 a week in their local Sainsbury's to feed 6 people, whereas Mrs Average Income was spending a more reasonable £80 in Aldi each week to feed 4 - although I think you would get an awful lot of food for £80 in Aldi and perhaps even she could have spent less if money was an issue.Mrs Average was making everything from scratch, they were eating balanced meals and eating together at the table; Mrs Rich was more haphazard about it all, and there was a \"cupboard of dreams\" to which the children had unrestricted access, full of chocolate, sweets, cakes and other general rubbish - and of course, when the families had their rules and food swapped, Mrs Average's children did actually make themselves little piggies in this cupboard whilst Mum was despairing of them ever eating another vegetable, I think.I found Mr Rich quite snobbish: \"beef cobbler is something that one ate at primary school in the seventies\" for example.  They turned their noses up at some of the recipes that they were advised to make, and Mrs Rich was in despair at the amount of time she was expected to be in the kitchen.I watched it as a one-off, and I don't know that it is a series - I don't think I would watch it every week if it was a weekly event.  We all know that there are all sorts of domestic regimes out there, and each family do their own thing ever so slightly differently from the next family in the street.  If you are a long-time reader here, you'll know that we are more like Mrs Average, and I expect that you are too."},

I have had a friend of the FH's round this morning, who is a plumber, and we are going to have an over-bath shower installed in the family bathroom.  I thought it would have to be an electric one, but that was going to be really expensive, considering where he was going to have to bring particular cabling from to supply the shower, but he can do a standard thermostatic mixer shower off the tank, which is just across the landing, and take the pipes up and over through the roof space.  I hesitate to call it a loft as the hatch is a bit small and there is only a lonely tv aerial up there!Is it really necessary? No.  Will it make my life easier? For sure.  Will it improve my quality of life? Yes - four or five women in a house with only one shower? Of course this will improve things!  And it will be another USP for this house in this development - none of the houses currently on the market have a shower in the bathroom - and when most of the houses are identical in layout, you need something to sway the buyers in your direction, or make them think that your house is really worth the asking price, I think.(image from soakology.com) I could definitely fancy this set up but not at this price!Anyone new to this blog must think that I am being very spendy.  I am but I'm not, too.  I've been laying in that bath for years, wondering how to get a shower over it one way or another, so this is not a spur-of-the-moment whim. Furthermore, I have the money to pay for it, and no-one will go into debt to achieve this.  Our generally frugal lifestyle allows us to make the monthly savings which pay for this kind of spend - once in a blue moon or two!  And, yes, I am Very Grateful that we are able to make these savings as I know that plenty of people are living one month to the next with not a spare penny.  I know.Furthermore, I have been told about a chap in the village who does decorating for £50 a day, so he will be on my hit-list to call to get the stairs walls painted - which architect thought it would be a good plan to have a full-height wall around the stairwell, and a window so high in the outside wall that the sill is a flies' graveyard because I am not bringing a ladder in every week or two to get up there to clean it!?  [When the house is on the market, I shall have to, but that will be time enough!]"},

We have decided to carry on with the application to take the European students in September, and someone will be coming to visit us - so we need to be spick and span for that, especially as she will be taking photos - eeek!  This weekend I have been having a sort out in the office, which was the dining room, in an attempt to bring it back into use as a dining room as well as having an office area at one end where I can work..........I'm getting there!  I will have to explain to her that the second student hasn't got a bed yet - I have had the offer of one from my dad but I have to work out the logistics of getting it here!  I will just be borrowing it as when we downsize to a smaller place in the future, I am sure that we will not have room for four single beds.I have to say that reading the book on the Kindle about the Marie Kondo method of tidying has helped me to consider things in a different light - and the YFG's making of some amazing chocolate brownies this weekend from a recipe off the BBC Good Food website makes me think that we can do without the 1001+ recipe books which are lining our walls.  Well, maybe we'll keep a few favourites.The trouble with spring is that there is never enough time - I want to be outside, sowing seeds and painting the sheds, etc, not in the house!  Oh well, hoping for better weather for a couple of days so that we can actually get outside and do things - had enough rain now but unfortunately, there is more in the forecast for today, which does save me watering the grass for today so it is not altogether a bad thing.Today I am working on the phones for four hours as I only did 2 hours yesterday, and I have a meeting with the tutor for my church work this afternoon too.  Hope you all have a blessed day x"},

And that leaves you a lot of time for Thinking. It's is almost as if God had said to me - \"Slow down!\" and then when I didn't, He had a think about it and said, \"Water this grass every day for two weeks and Slow Down!\" So I am.It's actually very good for me, and I am enjoying it, three days in.  So, I know that some bright sparks are going to wonder why I am not using a sprinkler.  Well, I tried... but water costs money, and I don't like to waste water or money, and it made me cross to see water shooting over the fence and into the neighbour's garden, and all up the brick wall of the house, and very little of it onto the actual grass, so I decided I could be more efficient - the grass needs the water so that is where it goes, all of it, not just a third of it!"},

{"title": "In the garden ", "date": "Monday 27 April 2015", "text": "I moved on two chicken houses yesterday - one to a new owner and one smashed up with a hammer as it was past repair: I haven't had that much fun with a mallet in years!  It was a very therapeutic half hour - I had started in a very ladylike manner, taking the bolts out of it one at a time, until I came to some that just would not budge.  So I decided that just smashing it apart with the mallet would be the most time-effective manner to deal with it. I had to get the FH's old car moving again as well, so I had to charge the battery up - the neighbour, J, came round to help me sort that out as I couldn't work out exactly where to put the charger clips on the battery but I took a photo when he had gone, so that I know for next time.  It started up yesterday afternoon so it got shifted OK and will be out of the way for the fencing chaps.When I had moved the old chook houses, I had to demolish a compost bin that the FH had made out of an old pallet box.  He had put it in situ and THEN built a shed so that it couldn't be removed from the position without being dismantled: I now have a wheelbarrow and two big bags full of lovely home made compost, and the bin is in the heap with the old chook house.All in all, I had about four hours pottering about in the garden - and it was lovely.  The sun was shining, and I stopped now and again for a cup of tea and a sit in the sunshine.  Hard to believe that the EFG phoned us up at tea time and said it was snowing in Aberdeen!  She sent us some photos to prove it too - what a contrast of a day from north to south.Hope you all have a good week - lots going on here this week so I had better get on!"},
{"title": "Breaking even", "date": "Sunday 26 April 2015", "text": "I had a terrifically busy day yesterday although some of the plans didn't come to fruition - the people are coming to get the chicken house today instead of coming yesterday - and I had some unexpected visitors, and then I forgot to shop for the frozen sausage rolls that I had been asked to buy for the refreshments, so I ended up making cheese scones instead!But it is just before 9am on Sunday morning and there is a service prepared and all is well in that department.  The quiz went well last night and we added about £120 to the church funds even though there were only about 20 people who came to the quiz - the top score was 63/100 so I think that the questions were sufficiently challenging.  I have to find another 100 for the end of June, and more for August and October so if anyone can recommend a source of good questions, I would LOVE to hear from you!My garden is going to be renovated this week: new fence posts and a smartening up of one side of the driveway, and about 145 square metres of turf on the chicken's old run area, including a chap to rotovate the area over first.  The grass should grow well when the roots get down in to the years' worth of chicken manure that has gone into the ground in that area of the garden.  It is going to be done in a couple of days.  And the best bit of it is that it is not going to break the bank.  Due to the savings routine that I have got into this year, which has involved using one pot of income to pay the direct debits, my income from the phones for food and diesel and other day to day living bits, and saving everything else that comes in, I can pay for this work without incurring any credit charges or interest anywhere - and just use our savings.  I had a huge stroke of luck yesterday in that the unexpected visitors came from the local bee club and bought some of the FH's equipment, so those funds have gone straight into the \"garden renovation\" pot to help with the expenses.  I am hoping that by the end of the month, although the savings won't have been added to this month, they won't have shrunk by too much either because I am just spending this month's savings, if I am very careful!I am looking into having some foreign exchange high school students to live with us from September to June whilst they attend the YFG's school in the Lower Sixth.  There is no \"rent\" but a generous food allowance is paid which would actually feed the family, not just the two students, and I think it would be a good experience for us all for nine months - for us to have more life about the place, more company of her own age for the YFG, and it would make me think harder about planning some more challenging and interesting meals - there has been a marked note of repetition in our menus lately here!  We are very early-on in that process and still finding out about it, but I'd also love to hear from anyone who has had long-term foreign students living with them.  I had lodgers from the local college when we lived in Cupar and some of them did come to us for the year, but they were Scottish boys, and went home at the weekends most of the time, whereas these would be girls from anywhere in Europe and would be here full time apart from a break at Christmas, usually, so we will be in uncharted waters for us! Enough for this morning - lovely weather here for ducks so a good day to stay inside and catch up on the ironing and housework I think!  We have the YFG's friend coming for tea, and her brother to whom I teach maths, because their parents are going out tonight, and the YFG went to them for tea last night whilst I was at the quiz.  They are lovely young people and we really enjoy having them - and they play board [bored, in my case!] games with the YFG, so that is a bonus for me!"},

But there is still some good news - there are Lidl vouchers for £5 off a £40 shop in \"Lidl News\" which should be inserted into a number of newspapers on Saturday 25th April - this weekend.  The website I saw that on says that we need to look out for it in the Sun, Express, Telegraph or Mail [and the Record in Scotland] so check that the insert is there when you buy the paper.And so what does that mean for my Aldi habit?  Well, I used to make the trip once a month and try to combine it with other things to make it worth my while, but if there is not going to be the main voucher for £5 any longer, it won't be worth it really.  My strategy will be to still go, but only when I am going near one anyway - and when I am there, I shall really stock up on the products I love, like the washing powder and washing up liquid.  If the Lidl voucher is a regular thing, I shall use that more often, as I have a Lidl much closer by and I like the quality of their meat, and I can eat their gluten-free meatballs too!"},

Unfortunately, the YFG confessed that she had dropped it with the lid off and some had spilled on the floor - and she scooped it up and put it back - eugh!My \"beauty routine\" in its most recent incarnation was inspired by Frugal Queen ages ago when she shared hers.  In the morning, I put some cheap Boots cold cream on my face and then remove it with a hot flannel - which cleans and exfoliates at the same time.  After gently drying, the morning moisturiser is applied and I'm done.The evening is slightly different in that I use a blackhead-removing cleanser on a cotton pad and then the evening moisturiser. There aren't really any blackheads around these days but my sister is neurotic about inspecting my face for them Every Time she sees me, so I do get a little paranoid about that :(Occasionally my eyes get a little definition with an eye liner that I have had for years, and I sharpen it now and again but it is still fine.  And I don't get any eye infections.  Mascara - well, the EFG bought me a new one for Christmas so that comes out now and again.  The only \"make up\" I use daily is the lip balm!I guess that makes me quite low maintenance - and not expensive. You can see why I don't spend my average allocation according to that article now!  And as for my hair - well, shampoo and conditioner are from the own-brand ranges of which ever supermarket or discounter I am in when I remember that we are running out - and I have just used the last box of dye that I bought in Boots several years ago when I was given a gift card and dye was on special offer so I bought six boxes with the card.  They have stopped selling that particular kind now of own brand dye so I shall be needing to find a replacement in about six months time......plenty of time!"},

And me?  Well, I have been working again today, doing the laundry, catching up on some phone calls and letter-writing [forgot that the FH had some shares till a letter came this morning about them and so I have had to write a letter about that, not that they are worth much!] and then had a break and sat knitting in the sun.  The YFG went to school for a revision session and I picked her and her friend up at 2pm, so I was out for a short while on taxi duty.  We seem to have done quite a lot today...no wonder I am getting weary.The weekend is here again and so I am hoping to get out into the garden again tomorrow, but I also have a service to prepare for Sunday so that must be the top priority tomorrow.  I know I shall look longingly out of the window so the earlier I get started and finished, the better.  Hope you all have a great weekend x"},

But I think she is too frail from that twitch to be in a large flock, and when I rehome the other chooks, I know that some of them will go to a home where there is a cockerel and a larger flock.  She is going to a lovely lady who has a special home for special chooks who need just that bit more TLC.  We will be delivering her to the lady's home and then going on to Bletchley Park.Some of the other chooks will be moving on in the next few weeks, and then I need to find anther home for my special Gold Partridge Orpingtons with their cockerel.When you raise them from thisand they grow into theseyou want them to be looked after!  When all of the girls [and boy] are in their new homes, I can set about redeveloping the land on which they have been living and making it more acceptable for the house to go on the market, possibly next year.  We know that the land is going to take some turning around and it won't be done overnight, so we need to be planning ahead a little.It is not going to be made into a posh garden but probably just grassed over and kept neat.  I know it is going to involve a lot of lawn mowing in the future, but hopefully it will not be my responsibility for too long!  It will be a blank canvas if a gardener wants to do something more ambitious with it all in the future - and well fertilised too!"},

A made-for-tv film, it has been advertised on the tv for a few weeks now.  I thought it was going to be a new series the first time the ad came out, and then I gradually realised that it was a film.  I know already that there have been some tweaks - a fourth son, for example!  But I am going to watch, nevertheless.  It is a sad reflection, though, of the low importance of religious broadcasting that this is scheduled for 8.30pm on a Monday night.  It would have been more impressive to have been able to put it out last night, on Sunday, when a bigger proportion of the community might have been watching..."},

We exchanged mobile numbers and email addresses before we left, and I am sure we will be in touch again soon.Connections are important - the Methodist Connexion is an example of that.  It would be wonderful if we could all share our connection in Christ, and hold that as more important that our myriad differences.  I've been disappointed at the response reported in the media that some of our supermarkets refused to stock the Real Easter Egg which is the only one which actually mentions Jesus.  It is really hard to help some people to understand the connection between Easter and Jesus when all they see in the media and in the shops are twee chocolate offerings and multiple pastel eggs which have nothing to do with our redemption.  Apparently one supermarket buyer told the Real Easter Egg rep that Easter had nothing to do with the church.......the mind boggles!I am going to try to think of some different ways to remind myself and others of the significance of Holy Week and Easter.  I hope you have a blessed and peaceful time this Easter."},

We are constantly bombarded with advertisements and inducements to visit shops and websites to be parted from our cash - and the companies are working hard at it.....my Facebook feed is full of it as well - two T-shirts for £30 from FatFace for example - probably because they found out that I bought a £45 jumper in the sale for £12.50 last autumn.  I get emails weekly from places that I have made purchases from in the past - the Book People and Approved Foods are constantly sending offers on delivery too.It feels like an uphill battle sometimes to keep my money in my purse and under my control.  All these companies are targeting us and trying to entice us to part with it, and on a whim.  Their advertising methods are very convincing and appeal to our selfish natures - \"You're worth it!\" they are constantly reminding us.  Well, actually, that is a matter for me to decide, and what I decide is \"worth\" it is a secure roof over our heads and cash in the bank for a rainy day. I had a conversation the other night with a dear friend, and I was almost speechless when she said she had never set foot in either an Aldi or a Lidl and hadn't a clue what they were like inside, or what they offered.  She's \"never needed to,\" she said.  In the next breath, when we moved on to filling in the forms for Tax credits, she confessed that she has no savings whatsoever.  As a single mum with several children, working hard, I would definitely be encouraging her to gather a few pounds together in an emergency fund.  And stepping into our local Lidl would be one way of starting that!Anyway, at this end of the month, I am delighted to be able to say that the £1000 savings we made in February has managed to stay in the bank and has been joined by some more cash.  The total isn't as dramatic this month, but we are definitely well on the way to our second thousand.  The YFG is completely on board, and when I said we had £350 left for all our expenses this month, she encouraged me to save another £100 and live on just £250!  I did remind her that it is the Easter holidays and she wants to go to Bletchley Park, so we will have some expenses there......we are hoping to go next Saturday.  She got a voucher for 20% off an admission when she bought me \"The Imitation Game\" DVD for Mothering Sunday, so we will be making use of that too, to keep the costs down a little.  And we will take our own food.  And not be tempted by too many souvenirs......."},

I have made two hats in that colour already as I can get two from a ball.  I have bought several other colours in the range and could probably happily knit from that range for years.  Hope you enjoy using that too, Donna!And the thank you notes - well, I used to buy a lot of Phoenix products years ago and I loved these note cards.  I probably have enough to stock my own wee shop so it was time to share the love and send them out into the world to bless someone else's day.All in all, a little representation of a few of my favourite things and pastimes."},

{"title": "Film review", "date": "Monday 23 March 2015", "text": "The YFG and I went to see the second film in the Divergent series on Saturday afternoon. This one is called \"Insurgent\". They are based on a trilogy of books by Veronica Roth, who has a tiny part in the film.  These two are the main characters, Tris Prior [Shailene Woodley] and Tobias Eaton/Four [Theo James].  Needless to say in a teenage film, there is a thread of a romance between them as well as the main thread of the story.  It was interesting to find out that Theo James is British and has actually acted in an early episode of our beloved Downton Abbey as the poor chap who died in Lady Mary's boudoir!Her mother is played by Ashley Judd, who I have watched no end of times in Double Jeopardy.(image from theguardian.com)The film a science-fiction based story, set in a Chicago which is almost destroyed and is surrounded by an enormous fence, more to keep the people safe than to keep them in, they are told.The people are separated into five factions, consistent with their dominant personality traits.  Tris and Four both come from Abnegation families, but end up in Dauntless, the warrior faction.(image from pinterest.com)Teenagers are tested for their aptitude and can change faction from the one into which they were born.  Tris's parents were devastated that Tris chose Dauntless and her brother moved into the Erudite faction.  At her testing, Tris finds that she has dominant traits from so  many of the factions that she doesn't actually fit into any one of them particularly - she is a \"Divergent\" which the government seek to find and destroy because they see people who can't be pigeonholed neatly as a threat to a stable society.  It was an interesting film and I had read the first two books in the trilogy - and now I find that I have to go and read the last one, Allegiant, as I am not sure I can wait two years to find out how the story ends.  As is the trend with books like this which are being made into films, they are all dragging out the final book by making it in to two films.  Film-makers did that with the Twilight books and are now doing it with the Hunger Games books too.  And so Allegiant will be made into two films.We went to a different cinema from our usual venue, and it was lovely.  The Light cinema in Wisbech made a refreshing change from the Cineworld cinema that we had regularly frequented.  Yes, the Light cinema doesn't have an arrangement to take Tesco Clubcard vouchers so I did have to part with real money but it was cleaner, more comfortable and more welcoming, so we are definitely going back.  It wasn't expensive as these things go - the tickets for the two of us booked online came to less than £13.  Needless to say, we passed on the popcorn, the huge paper cups of Coke and the assorted other items of junk food which we on offer in the foyer.  A reasonable treat for Mothering Sunday, even if it was a week late!"},

We talked about how we might devote ourselves to something like marriage or parenthood compared to a short term commitment to something like an evening class for a period of a few weeks.  We considered our faith and our devotion to that, and how we live out that commitment in our life.As I am going to get the last section of my local preacher's course in the post to the HQ this week, I reflected a little on the dedication that getting this course done over the last almost five years has required.  I shall be very relieved to get it in the post, I have to say."},

Well, you know me!  Trying hard to find positive thoughts each day, and feeling gratitude, are my keys to happiness.  There are always things I could do better, I know, and sometimes I get overwhelmed with stuff - but there are things to look forward to and I know that this season of busyness isn't going to last for ever, thank goodness!Professor Brian Cox is on the tv this morning on the BBC's eclipse programme - and he seems to be permanently cheerful with his cheeky smile!(image from telegraph.co.uk)My joy got a knock yesterday when the annual Council Tax bill arrived, but I did know that it would arrive at some time this month!  £127 a month this time, and that is with my single adult occupancy discount......so the two months of being able to make a little extra in savings are over.  I've had a good week spending-wise in that I have hardly left the house, and so I haven't spent anything in the shops.  I have bought two cinema tickets on line for the YFG and I go to see a film tomorrow afternoon as she was a bit disappointed that I didn't have much time to spend with her last weekend.  It is her choice of film, so I am not sure how much I am going to enjoy that bit, but given that I shall be out with her, I'm sure it will be a good time - she is very good company :)  My lack of shopping this week drove her to the cooker last night - there was no \"food\" [read \"snacky stuff\"] and so she made herself a carrot cake. Anyway, I am going to watch the Eclipse on the tv now and then start work - doesn't seem to be any point trying to phone people this morning until it is over!  Enjoy the first day of spring, and let's all try to be a little bit happier today - it's all about making connections with others, they say......"},

She enjoyed it with butter naan.  It was possibly the most expensive dish of curried vegetables I have ever encountered, at £8.99, and would have Elaine over at MFin3 appalled, I am sure!  They had a great evening though, and it also fitted in with her new vegetarian tendencies.  The Easter holidays are set to be interesting.However, personally, I think I would stick with the cakes in the last post as a birthday treat.  I'm not going to mention what I think of curry..."},

{"title": "When did that happen?", "date": "Thursday 12 March 2015", "text": "When did the definition of \"super\" change to include the meaning of \"extraordinarily or particularly\" as in \"that was super fun\" or \"that was super interesting\"?  Does anyone know? I am used to \"super\" in other contexts, but this one is beginning to drive me just a little potty as it seems to be cropping up more and more - and I have to admit that I don't really like it.  What is wrong with \"very\" in those sentences, or is \"super\" so much more than \"very\" or does \"really\" not even hit the mark?  It feels as if it might be a transatlantic import, as I have read it more often on US blogs, but I am interested to know where the usage has originated - I love language! I was intrigued to learn a new word today on Frugal in Norfolk's blog: \"chavel\" - it was clear from the sentence that it means chopping or mashing something up, but I had to go and find out more about where that had come from - what a lovely word!  I think I might have to start using that - thanks :)(image from thejournal.ie)Grinning ear to ear this morning - not only did I finally find the dratted tax return at about 10.30pm last night, safely stored not a metre away from where it SHOULD have been, but the finances are looking good this morning - we have hit our first £1000 target in our challenge for the year!It doesn't exactly mean that we have saved £1000, but it means that we have £1000 more in assets than we did at the start - because it includes things like my Nectar points (over £40), Shop&Scan points (£32) and YouGov points.  They will all translate into buying power, so I include them.  It also includes a debt to me from the EFG in that I lent her £90 towards her new glasses until her next grant comes in, so I know I will get that back.With aiming to really raid the stores and spend less in the next few weeks, I am hoping that we will be able to maintain this level and move onwards and upwards.  If I could sell some of the beehives in the shed that the FH left, I am sure we would soon be at the next level.......Thank you for all your kind comments about the tax return - I am still resisting doing it online and prefer the paper version.  I know I will have to go over to online eventually but I probably won't until I have to!"},

{"title": "Temper in the Temple", "date": "Sunday 8 March 2015", "text": "(image from angalmond.blogspot.com)Joining in with Ang at Tracing Rainbows for today's Pause in Lent.The gospel reading for today was the story of Jesus overturning the tables in the Temple and clearing out the money changers.  He was indignant, angry, incensed, at the lack of reverence for the house of God.  A far cry from the gentle Jesus that we read about some of the time.There was a flare up of indignation at our chapel this morning too, right as I was about to begin the service. I had just explained that the preacher for next Sunday was ill and would not be taking the service, but that the administrator had asked for other volunteers to take the services that he would be unable to do. I let the congregation know that if no one came forward, I would provide them with the service that I would be taking elsewhere, and they could share it between them.A comment came from my right from a lady concerned that I not leave them the \"unintelligible drivel\" I had provided on a previous Mothering Sunday.A lady on my left immediately leapt to my defense, and was quite plain in the expression of her own thoughts about the timing and content of the other person's opinion.They hadn't even heard the gospel at that point.I stood at the lectern, about to take the service and uncomfortable at the confrontation and unsure of just what to say.  Another lady in the congregation helped me out by saying that she hoped someone volunteered to come and take our service so that I didn't have to worry about them.It was not the most conducive start to a service I have ever had.  It made me think though, about the aptness of the gospel and the behaviour of some people in the church today and in the Temple back then.  There are times and places for the frank expression of views, and that wasn't it.I hope your Sunday morning has been less controversial.[BTW, the reading I had provided that the lady was upset about was either from Glennon Melton or Ann Voskamp, and since both of them are published authors and well-respected truth-tellers, I know it wasn't drivel! It was about motherhood, though, rather than the Mother Church, which I think was the lady's problem.]"},

You'd be forgiven for wondering, I have to say.  And the answer is - not as thrifty as I would like!  Life has got stupidly, crazily busy this month, and I am desperate to sort out some free time one way or another.....I haven't picked up a knitting needle this week at all - but I have found out that a friend has started to volunteer at Jimmy's Shelter in Cambridge, so she is going to ask if they could use some of the knitted hats that my dedicated band of ladies are still churning out at a good rate - we only need 25 each year for the OCC boxes, but I have got quite a stash and have probably got enough for several years - and they keep coming!More on that another time, I hope. And yes, the thriftiness is going on, just more quietly and under the radar.  The electricity remains at about 10 units a day, which is still good for us; we are not spending madly at the shops, and the fire has only been lit for a couple of days this week, in the evenings, as we haven't really felt the need for much heat some days.But the EFG is putting me to shame with her meal planning - she plans two weeks and orders what she needs to be delivered from Sainsbury's and then freezes it until the appointed day.  Somebody upset the plan a little this week by relieving her of two slices of bacon, which perturbed her rather, but I am so pleased with her organisation and planning!Enough wittering for tonight - have a good weekend and I'll be back tomorrow, I hope, with time to have a mooch around your blogs too xxx"},

Challenging ourselves to just stop and consider how others see us is a good way to reflect upon whether our lives really do show others what we believe.  We might come to the conclusion that there are a few changes we would benefit from making during this time of reflection and prayer."},

There are also craft patterns and books in those boxes too.  The drawers on the left have got various items of clothing, and the bottom drawer has some presents ready for birthdays and even Christmas!  This area used to be where the FH's clothes hung as there is a rail in the section; my clothes hang next door in the adjoining section.  I keep all our socks in the wee chest of drawers that you can just glimpse on the right.The FH made this bed and it has four drawers under each side, so I can keep toiletries and loo rolls stashed under there.   I love my IKEA quilt and it brings me a great deal of satisfaction each morning to make my bed and the room looks tidy.But the best thing is really - the empty spaces!  Clear surfaces are very liberating, as well as much easier to keep clean because we don't have to keep working round things!"},

{"title": "Finishing posts", "date": "Wednesday 25 February 2015", "text": "When you are down, I am always one for looking for the positives in life.....there are several finishing posts in sight now, and I am heading towards a couple of them at a good rate.First of all, it is Wednesday night - that means that Friday is on the horizon already as we are already more than halfway through the week.  Phew!  Some weeks are harder to get through than others.Second, I am now into the sixth month of my work on the phones.  That means that in less than a month, I could hand in my notice with no financial penalty.  I'm not going to give notice until I have another job, but just knowing that I am so close to the six month get-out opportunity gives me cause for a wee jig around the kitchen.And third, and possibly the biggest - I have just this week finished the last unit of Faith and Worship for submission at the end of March.  Now I do still have to do three Bible studies/exegeses, but I am definitely on the last lap.  I've been at this for over four years - it has been both joyous and hard work, but infinitely rewarding and deeply challenging.  I'm nearly done...And tomorrow is the day when I consider my finances and look to see whether we are any closer to the savings target for the year.  I'm honest with you, and at this moment in time - I don't think we will be very close to this month's target at all - BUT I have paid the cam belt bill on the car for £290 and I have put money aside for the car insurance bill, so actually, I'm not doing so bad.  Put it this way, I don't owe anyone anything, thank goodness.  There's some money coming in at the end of the month, so we may be able to make a late sprint some way towards the target, but it may end up more of a limp than a sprint!Thanks for reading, folks, and don't forget the Aldi voucher tomorrow if it would be of use to you xxGood news - several people have commented that the Aldi vouchers will be in the paper tomorrow, so I shall definitely be making an attempt to find a copy of the Mirror then. I need to stock up on some of the things which we prefer to get from Aldi, like their washing-up liquid, laundry liquid and shower gels.  We won't spend £40 on just those items, but there will be tinned tomatoes, probably a little meat and some fish, fruits and veggies and other items to bulk up the order to hit the target.And then there was the Sainsbury's order last night.  It just gets better!  I used a £10-off-when-you-spend-£50 voucher again on the order, and replenished the fridge and cupboards with things that I had whittled down a little whilst the YFG was away last week.  The £1 delivery slot was at 9-10pm last night, but we actually got the order at 8.15pm - the driver had come from such a distance with so few deliveries that he was running well ahead of schedule and called to see if he could deliver early. After me, his next delivery was at 10pm, and well over 50 miles from me, heading north!  So I actually got a £2-worth delivery slot which meant we had it all scanned and packed away well before bed time!  And there was another £10 off voucher attached to the receipt, to be used by the 10th March, so I shall have to organise my shopping to accommodate that - can't miss out on that!Last night, we had to go to school for a meeting about the YFG's exams - we are on a 10 week countdown, apparently.  Revision all the way. She is staying after school today, I think, to work on her Textiles coursework project.  Hard to think my \"baby\" will be 16 this summer and heading towards A levels and beyond - time really moves on when you're not looking!The sun is shining now that the showers have passed over, so I am hoping for a brighter day today than we had yesterday.  Lots of work to do on the phones today, but at least I am working at the back of the house where the sun is brightest. Washing is already done and on the airers in the back bedroom so that will benefit from the sunshine too.....Have a good day xx"},

But I have no passion for the work, and it is not really my thing at all.  The lay employee position would be something I would wake up every morning and be inspired to do - it wouldn't be an easy job in many ways, but it is so much more than a \"job\".  God's work can never be just a job."},
{"title": "A Pause in Lent in the Fens", "date": "Sunday 22 February 2015", "text": "(image from angalmond.blogspot.co.uk)Joining in today with Ang over at Tracing Rainbows with the \"A Pause in Lent\" series.The Gospel passage that I am preaching on today is Mark 1 where the Holy Spirit drives Jesus out into the wilderness: a time of trial and temptation.  It seems that God has sent plenty of people out into the wilderness throughout the Bible - Abraham, Moses, Elijah, the Israelites. They all go out not quite sure about something, and they come back as grounded people of God. God never sent them out there to laugh at them, to abandon them and to leave them there - they always come back, and He always cares for them whilst they are there.And so I think we have to go into the wilderness at times too, but with the reassurance that God is looking out for us, caring for us, and that whilst we are in the \"wilderness\" [whatever constitutes our own wildernesses], our faith will be deepened and strengthened.  Perhaps we'll go more than once, too.  I don't think we should be afraid of these times, for God never leaves us, and after all, Jesus went through it, to lead the way for us.Time to go and get \"dressed\" for church now - thinking of Ang's post this morning!"},

She unpacked her bag all over the sitting room floor to share some of her purchases with me, and then came and sprawled with her legs on my lap as we sat on the sofa and caught up on the week.  It is fabulous to have her home!  She is still asleep now, and likely to be for a little longer, I should think.I watched a film last night whilst doing the ironing; the film was called \"Machine Gun Preacher\" and I was wondering what I had let myself in for in the first twenty minutes or so, but it was setting the scene for the dramatic changes to come. The horrifying story of the atrocities in Sudan was portrayed without pulling any punches, and showed how children's lives are destroyed by war.  Really makes you think and puts things into perspective: there was a hard scene where Sam Childer's daughter in Pennsylvania wanted to talk to him about getting a limo to travel to her prom with her friends when he was desperate to find $5000 to keep the children in the Sudanese orphanage fed and looked after.And so today stretches in front of me - the YFG's washing needs to be done, and there is a service to prepare for tomorrow - but no gymnastics, no shopping and not too much else pressing, so there is still a bit of the half-term holiday feeling in the air!"},

No chance!  She was kind enough to give me back the £3 one and used the £6 one instead, and I also used the £2.59 till spit, and another one for 29p, so I still totalled £8.88 off the shop, but £11.88 would have been better!In my own positive-outlook kind of way, I can be very grateful that it worked for two weeks out of the three that the vouchers covered, and also that I still had a good deal in the shop yesterday.  I scored a huge pack of  washing powder for a church fundraiser at half price too, so I was happy with that.And you know what else?

Since then, I hit the shops, came home and put the little haul away, hosted a meeting at the house here for gymnastics folks, did some tutoring in maths for a Y8 family friend who is struggling a wee bit with his confidence, and now I have just put the service for the morning together.(image from campwander.com)  The YFG is still snuffling around, but she is better at this end of the day than she was this morning.

Throat glands are up, she's got a hacking cough.....need I go on?I have dosed her up with paracetamol for the temperature, cold flannel too, and cough medicine.  Sleep will do her good, I hope, too.  She's also had orange juice for the sore throat and the vitamins!I think I'll just change my name to Florence, lady of the lamp, as that's all I am doing just lately.  The poor love isn't having much luck what with one thing and then another.(image from usborne.com)I have serious respect for single parents with small children now, as I am struggling with the responsibility, and I think it would have been ten times worse when they were younger!Will she get to Aberdeen on Monday?Who knows?  It's going to take some serious rest to manage it.....Well, my bedroom has been, at least!  I have read about the KonMari method of tidying lately on various blogs, including Elaine's at MFin3, and thought that it sounded like a plan.  I am all for tidying, but so short on time just lately, so if it stays tidy, so much the better!  I bought the book about it all on the Kindle, and devoured it last week, and then I started tidying out my drawers and \"stuff\" in the bedroom. Well, there's plenty of floor in there now.  And about three bin bags of extra clothes [some of it some of the FH's, I admit] have moved out.  And there is another bag full of items that are on their way to the charity shop tomorrow.  I've cleared out stuff that a) doesn't fit, b) I don't really like and c) I had got too much of in the first place.My room is just that, Mine, so it is less likely to get cluttered up with other people's stuff.  The living room is going to be very challenging to deal with.....And the lovely lady who wrote the book and invented the method has a huge thing about books.  I'm not even going there at the moment.  Clothes and general tat I can deal with , but my books - no.

There is a group of local churches, some Methodist and some Church of England, which come together to have the Day of Prayer together each year, and we are hosting it. When I agreed to be the \"organiser\", it was last March, and the FH was alive and I was at home with him. Things have changed, so I had to say to the ladies who met that although I could attend the service, I wouldn't have time for a lot of advance preps and wouldn't be able to hang around afterwards either!  I asked for volunteers for the making of various props, which I am not sure that they were expecting, but they stepped up and it is all sorted now.  Delegation is a lovely word....Technology I am not so keen on. I had a phone call last night from a steward at the church where I am preaching on Sunday. They have a projector and all the words to the hymns are put up on the wall, along with the order of service, so that they have a nice picture up there whilst the prayers are being read out, for example, and a suitable image whilst the offertory is being made....All very well, but she wants it all today.  My services sometimes don't come together until Saturday afternoon or evening, so it feels like a lot of pressure to be able to produce this today.  It also means that I can't move things around or change my mind about something later on.  Dratted technology!  The older chapels where they just use hymn books suit me much better....And who runs?  A group of my friends have taken up running and it seems that more and more people I know in their forties are running.  The weird thing is that I sometimes have dreams about running, long distances, not just to catch a bus.  I'm seriously trying to curtail this urge.  I don't think I shall be running this year.  Or next.  It IS frugal and free, but probably not for me.Have a good day, friends, and a warm welcome to those who have joined us here lately xxx"},

The FH made the two wooden airers years ao and the little one in the middle is an Argos investment.  I am bitterly regretting letting the EFG take the other one of those to Aberdeen, and I should have just given her some cash to buy one when she arrived.  They are extremely useful, and no longer on sale, sadly.  Once I had mastered the art of pegging items onto the little airer as if it were a washing line, I could hang much more up. Between them, the three airers will hold two loads of washing.Items dry under this arrangement very quickly.  Towels are folded up and put straight into the linen cupboard in the corner of the room, and items that don't require ironing are folded and put into the airing cupboard. Ironing is put into a basket which lives on the bed as it dries and then ironed when I have a basket load.  Soon the weather will warm up, and I will progress to hanging out in the verandah.  I confess to be desperately looking forward to spring and summer days when I can put the laundry out on the proper outside washing line and it will come in, beautifully scented with fresh air!  Not a tumble drier in sight and quite a saving on the electricity by making use of the solar power of the sun.  I would always recommend a south-facing house - we rejected many in our last search for a house because of their aspect!"},

I'm also waiting for a £30 giftcard to come through from Tesco Insurance after I got a good deal on the car insurance there last month, but that could be six weeks before that is issued.So, casting YouGov aside and not counting giftcards until they are in one's hand, I am still about £100 up - and for not doing an awful lot really! And how to spend this bounty?  Nectar points are likely to be hoarded and added to until the girls' birthdays in the summer, or even Christmas if I can hold out that long!  Clubcard vouchers are also possibly going to be doubled up for clothing in the long run - I am a fan of a fairly basic wardrobe and my jeans are going to need replacing this year!  The Shop&Scan points will eventually be traded in for Amazon points - again, possibly towards items for birthdays, or books that I need for church reading!  It saves me spending cold hard cash that I have had to earn, anyway, and in the main, this is money earned by doing things we do everyday.......but it does all help in the grand scheme of things :)"},

(image from bbc.co.uk)These two chaps, Gregg Wallace and Chris Bavin [never heard of him, but apparently he is an award-winning green-grocer], set out to overhaul a family's shopping habits with the aim of reducing their outgoings.I should have known.It wasn't going to be Mr and Mrs Average with two children, spending £100 a week, and getting it down to a more reasonable £60.  Oh no, it was Mr and Mrs Big Spender with 4 children, and they spent, on average, £355 a week.  A week!  They also visited the shops/supermarkets 17 times in an average week......that's spending!  They had some very specific ideas about brands, too.  To give them some credit, they did seem to take on board what was suggested - but it was nothing we didn't already know: scale down the brands, cook from scratch more, and shop with a plan in mind, for example.So if you start with someone spending so much more than average, getting it down is not going to be that challenging, is it?  Apparently, the average family with four children spends about £105 on a weekly basis.  A challenging programme would have helped Mr and Mrs Average bring that down even further so that we could see some stellar strategies like those from Elaine at Mortgage Free in Three [check this link for a great idea to help with meal planning] and recipes like this one from Frugal Queen.Sadly, I don't think people who read frugal blogs have anything much to learn from this programme, and I shall not be wasting another hour on it next week."},

I did this a few years ago when we were going on holiday to Bridlington - I ended up with about £140 and enough to pay for all our treats, outings and food whilst we were away.  This time, I am going to put all my egg money in it, as the chooks will be laying again in abundance shortly and I shall have a few regular customers for eggs.  All the pounds help! (image from ebay.co.uk)I did laugh to myself though, as the tin is a child's one, themed for the \"Frozen\" movie - which I haven't seen - and Ella in the movie has a song which seems to be centred around the line, \"Let it go!\" which is the exact opposite of what I shall be doing with the dosh in the tin!  Considering that someone is charging £5.99 for these on eBay, I think I scored a bargain there.I also took some time this morning to create a baseline spreadsheet, which I have used before, to monitor my savings.  Things wax and wane, but as long as the overall total heads upwards, I shall be happy.  I aim to be £5000 better off at the end of the year than I am today......and the spreadsheet I found on the computer and used to re-jig for this year is the very one I used in 2012 and 2013, which meant that I could see which months were good for boosting the coffers and which were the worst drains on the finances.  Watching patterns helps."},

It was lovely!  The first outside cuppa of the year.Tonight - it is snowing.Not best pleased, as I have to go to gymnastics tomorrow and I hate driving in the snow, so I am really hoping that it goes by 3pm tomorrow afternoon!  It does look beautiful in the glow of the streetlights, but it's going to be mushy in the morning....But, on the other hand, if I didn't need to go to gym, I would quite happily stay snug and warm at home.  I've had the fire alight all day, and it has kept the sitting room warm whilst I have been in and out.  I've got the news on now, and we are set for more snow overnight, I think.  We've got all the food we need, plenty to do and lots to keep warm with, so we are all set.  I did think there would be more \"winter\" before we saw Spring.  Cold winds blowing down from the North have brought us this, after it has deposited some on the EFG in Aberdeen - she's got more than us, I think, but hers is less attractive as it has been hanging around for a while.  If the back garden still looks nice in the morning, I may even be tempted to take a photo!"},

Since there is no Council Tax payment due this month, I could have just moved the money into the savings, but I thought it would be sensible to stock up on some more firewood.The wood was delivered yesterday afternoon and I have two tonne-bags of ready chopped wood sitting on the back driveway now - it was gone 4pm when it was delivered and there was no time last night to get it stacked. That will be a job for this afternoon.  It is wood which needs to be stacked so that it can continue to dry out and it will be ready to burn by the autumn.Now that it is February, I am hoping that we are looking forward to Spring, but I do fear that we still have some wintry weather to come before the weather changes for the better. The wind is howling here this morning!We went to Tesco yesterday afternoon when we came out of gymnastics. I had two vouchers which had arrived in the post - one for £4 off a £30 spend, and one for £6 off the same - and I was curious to know whether our local system would let them both be used on the same shop, inspired by reading on Sue's blog some time ago that she had done this in Wales - I certainly think it was Sue, but if it wasn't, I apologise - someone somewhere blogged about it!  Anyway, I tentatively offered both vouchers to the cashier, and they both went through, so I achieved a £10 saving on the shopping. I have a few more of those, and may use some of them, but I don't think I shall be going there every week!  They are not getting the better of me that easily, as I know that there is not going to be the need to spend as much as the vouchers require each week.I was delighted this week to get the electricity direct debit down to £44 from £50. Entering a reading regularly has enabled the company to work out that we are not using £50 a month, and they can also see that we are heathily in credit too, so we have a reduction - and more pennies left in my bank account each month, rather than languishing in their coffers!  To think that we were paying Utility Warehouse over £100 a month when we were here first just shows that shopping around for better prices, combined with monitoring usage carefully, can really reduce the costs.  Yes, halving the number of people in the property most of the time has also helped, I know, but I am still running three freezers, hoovering the same number of times a week, and so some things haven't changed.Today, I have a service to lead first of all, then I am planning to get that wood safely stacked away, do the ironing and get some work done on Faith & Worship - and then it is feet up with the knitting for a while when Call the Midwife and the last Last Tango in Halifax come on.  That is my Sunday night treat!"},

My eyes felt like they were on stalks by the end, though, despite me wearing my reading glasses diligently.  I spoke to some lovely people, including one lady who wanted to make her appointment to have her vehicle serviced but was in the bath so didn't have her diary to hand - thank goodness she wasn't on the loo!!  Doing the extra hours is a step towards regaining the time I had off unpaid whilst the YFG was in the hospital.I nipped into the shop which is closing down and bought some bargains as I had hoped - half price posh shampoo which I wouldn't buy at full price but which at half price is good value, some odd items of food which were also around half the recommended price as well, and I managed to avoid the temptation of the sweets and boxes of chocolates too!  I was also pleased to find some wrapped soap which is ideal for the Operation Christmas Child boxes - my sister donated some six-packs of Knights Castile which I am going to be using for the rest of my life as I can't send it since the individual bars are not wrapped. I am buying wrapped soap and using up the donated stuff.......We also had a good relaxing time in the evening, eating our supper and watching some tv together by the fire.  The fire is both a comfort and a joy - and I have ordered a load of wood to be delivered at the weekend: it will need to dry out for next winter, but it is a sound investment.  I am a big fan of the woodburner and will always recommend them to people.We had a few flurries of snow in the Fens yesterday and some bitterly cold winds, but nothing compared to what some areas are experiencing - and certainly no earthquakes either!  Stay safe and warm, folks xxx"},

I have had quite a few no-spend days this week, but I had to give UJ £7.50 yesterday for some seed potatoes he bought for me, so that was just a little spend.  And today I may spend some too as there is a shop closing down not too far from us where I have heard that they are making crazy reductions to clear the stock - so I am going to see what bargains are to be had there.....on my own so that I focus on what we will actually use and not what might be a tasty treat!Let's all hope that the YFG has a good day!  I have also seen that the weather is getting a little wild again - we had a fence panel come loose yesterday so we have some repair work to get organised soon: stay safe and warm wherever you are xx"},

I do appreciate your comments and thoughts....I sometimes wonder how people find us and what draws them here - good to have you with us, anyway!  It is interesting how our numbers swell in numbers for a week or so and then the figures are static for weeks.....such is life. Do you know what \"frogged\" means in relation to knitting or crochet?  I didn't!  One I didn't have to frog, thank goodness!It kept cropping up on a blog I read when a lady was talking about all her works-in-progress and she let us know that one or two items had been \"frogged\" and worked again.  Well, it all became clear eventually, but it seems to be one of those slightly dodgy words that has all sorts of meanings, depending on the company one keeps!!Are there any other words you know that have a specific meaning in craft terms?"},

Let's hope for some good spring weather by then.Nearly the end of the month.  I need to get my frugal attitude back into high gear and start making some serious savings around here!  I have coasted through January without having time to worry too much about saving, and we have managed.  I have had some big bills to pay though, and there are a few more on the cards.  The car's service in December had to be paid for this month, and that was over £300. I have also had to tax the car at £110 and insure it as well. I have paid the tax straight off but I put the insurance on to the credit card to get some points on it!  I found a good deal with Tesco, which should also be scoring me a £30 Gift card within 6 weeks of the policy coming into force.  In February, I shall need to get the cam belt replaced....that could be expensive too.  Ho hum!"},

At 84, Dad is not bad with technology - we had him playing Freeflow on my tablet when he was here at Christmas and he quite enjoyed it!So, a weekend at home is on the cards.  No gym this weekend as I have told the folks that I have to prioritise the YFG's recovery, and no church service to prepare.  I am hoping to get another unit of Faith & Worship completed and lots of rest is also on the agenda.  Not too much of anything else at all.  Hope you all have a good weekend - and keep warm xxx"},

The YFG is making good progress, although she has a big bruise around her tummy button where one of the wounds is. She's been having a lie in most mornings and then getting up and watching a little tv, before doing her school work.  The maths has been completed, the history is half way there, and the geography was on the table last night, looking at the impact of the growth of mobile phone technology on the population of China.....I am definitely having another wobble about the job, which is a disappointment as I thought I had got into the swing of it.  I am still concentrating hard on being grateful for the opportunity but actually, some of the time, I can hear the FH telling me that life is too short to be bogged down like this, and that I do not \"need\" the money that badly.  Since I started the job in September, if I give notice before the same time in March, I have to lose two week's wages in respect of the time I was paid whilst I was being trained, according to the contract, so I will be sticking it out until March, unless they sack me first!  With the two week's notice I have to give, I could be out of it in ten weeks.  That gives me some comfort, knowing that if I don't get better at it, and get back into managing it, instead of dreading it, there are a limited number of days left that I have to do!  At the moment, I feel that it is affecting my health, as I find myself clenching my teeth a lot, and feeling jittery.....not good.UJ will be here today, a comforting and solid presence in our lives. He's going to help me clean out the chooks this afternoon, since I need a helping hand to hold up the lid of one of the chook houses whilst I shovel the you-know-what!   He enjoys his afternoons sitting by the wood burner once he has done a little work in the shed, chopping the wood for the kindling for me - he has definitely earned a rest after being out there, working up a sweat over the saw each week as he has been doing.  I wouldn't be able to do it without chopping off a finger or two, I'm afraid, so I am glad of his help! Well, off now to let out the chooks in the rain, and see if they are going to be in the mood to start laying some eggs again soon - the YFG had me making chocolate brownie for her the other night, so if that is going to be on her recuperation menu, I need more eggs!!"},

And just one little moan - why does the BBC have to show all the great shows at the same time?!  We have a brilliant evening's viewing on Sundays and then we have Silent Witness on Mondays and Tuesdays now - that's four hours of viewing to fit into three nights - I do get quite a bit of knitting done on those nights, I have to say :)Back to work with a bang, and another kind of performance review today.  This learning curve goes up and down like a yo-yo, and what one director told me before Christmas has had an impact on some of my results, which another director has told me today that I need to be careful about.  I'll take it all on board and see what happens at the next review.  They are going to look at my figures again at the end of the week.....nothing like a bit of pressure to focus the mind.  It did make me have a quick mooch around the job websites whilst I had a cuppa, though.  There's nothing else as convenient, flexible and child-friendly available, so I will hang on in there.Off to make the hot water bottles and get snuggled down for the night xxSh!  Just the tiniest sprinkle has arrived overnight and if I don't wake her up soon, the YFG won't even see it as the sun is out and the snow is beginning to disappear....The EFG has had more in Aberdeen, and the slush has frozen, so she is slightly fearful for her walk into the university this morning.  Told her to be careful and get the bus!Going to light the fire now, and then I will be getting ready to start work again...stay warm and safe, wherever you are xxx"},

Wednesday was spent having various tests done until at about 4pm, the chap decided to put her on the op list for that night.  She eventually went along to the theatre at 11pm and came back, wailing loudly, at 1am.  She was in a 4-bed bay but it was a jolly good job she had it to herself that night.  She was wobbly and woozy most of the day yesterday, but perked up today and we escaped at about 3.30pm!The EFG has been a star this week, and just been a tower of strength and independence for me.  She was taken home by the FH's cousin on Wednesday night and came back really early on Thursday morning on the train, before heading off to Aberdeen on the train again just after lunch.  She's safely back in her halls there, and ready to start work again on Monday.  We shall miss her no end, again!UJ also stepped into the breach and stayed over on Wednesday night and last night to be the chicken wrangler so that I didn't need to worry about coming home, and he was here with the EFG as we were a little bit worried about her being here alone with all the wild weather that was forecast.  Good job he was here as part of one of the chicken runs sustained some damage in the wind, and he was able to repair it for me today......he's another star!Thanks for all the kind messages.  We intend to do as little as possible this weekend and just rest and recover. I am back to work on Monday but the YFG will be having a few more days at home - her teachers have sent work home so she has plenty to keep her occupied whilst she rests!"},

They are still searching for a female in connection with all of this too.  Glennon Melton writes well on her website at Momastery about love and this is well worth a read.  I urge you to pop over there and have a look: this article was written about the 9/11 tragedy but it is just as relevant to Paris.  Stay safe this weekend, wrap up warm and eat well!"},
{"title": "A lesson from the past", "date": "Friday 9 January 2015", "text": "I watched a programme last night about borstal and a social experiment led by a renowned criminologist where a group of young chaps who had a string of over 60 convictions between them were to live in a castle/prison in Northumberland for four weeks......it was very interesting.  Remember that I watched it with the knowledge of one receiving regular letters from someone currently having a rest at HM's pleasure. My stepson is actually having a rest - he is reading books as fast as the library system can procure them for him, he is pottering about in the workshops making things and helping others to learn woodworking skills, and he is listening to the radio quite a lot too.  A far cry from the 14 or 16 hour days he was putting in when he was at work and trying to earn a living seven days a week.  He is not \"happy\" in there - but he is not there to be happy, after all - he hates the food, the lack of choice and the rules and regulations - but he does appreciate why he is in there and he is behaving himself in order to make sure he gets out on time. So the programme about the life in the borstal was intriguing - and I know that the FH would have loved it.  As someone who served a long apprenticeship under a firm-but-fair foreman, and then did his National Service in the RAF, he understood the benefits of discipline, running a tight \"ship\" and people doing as they were told.  He believed that this sort of thing helped to put the Great in Great Britain.The thing that struck me about the lads on the programme was their attitude - they were so arrogant and cocky, aggressive and defensive all the time, one step away from a fight, it seemed.  Not the way to live - but I can see that if that is the way some young people are these days, it is no wonder at the way they interact with people and struggle to hold down a job, showing the absolute contempt for authority that they did.I shall plan to watch the other programmes in the series over the next three weeks and see how it goes - three of the lads have walked out already so how many there will be left by the end is anyone's guess!"},

It came to just over £4, but I had one of their price match coupons for £2.10 so I ended up only paying for half my shopping today which I was rather pleased about.  I have also got a voucher for £10 off when I spend £50 on a Sainsbury's online delivery, by next Wednesday, so I am considering having a delivery from them next week instead of having to go to the shop myself.Tomorrow brings an ICT module exam for the YFG which carries a few marks towards her final grade, so she has been revising hard this week.  We are both going to stop at 9pm and watch Silent Witness tonight as we do enjoy that programme.  Thank goodness for the return of some decent things on the television - we are also looking forward to the return of Call the Midwife before too long!"},

Not being able to eat pasta nor the soup, I concocted my own supper from some bottom of the fridge bacon, some broccoli that was almost past its best and half an onion.

And \"eucharisteo\" is usually translated as \"giving thanks\" so we have a trinity of holy meanings here.  For me, it's about giving thanks, recognising graces and finding the joy.  It is the word which helps me to get through the days.On the days when the boring job on the phone grinds me down, I recall that it is a way of earning money which is flexible, above minimum wage and I can do it at home - and I am thankful. On the day when I lost the FH, I was able to be thankful for the wonderful caring attitudes of the staff who looked after him in his final illness and then had time to spend with us as I wept.  I was grateful for the medical advances which had kept him going for so long after his transplant.  Most of all, I was grateful for our years together and all the time we shared.   I give thanks for our two amazing daughters and their love.On the days when I worry about the future, I stop and think about the blessings I have, and give thanks.On the days when I wonder how life will turn out, I give thanks for the way God has guided me in the past.I think it is a good word for me right now!"},
{"title": "A free weekend", "date": "Saturday 3 January 2015", "text": "One of the last few days before the reality of the normal routine really kicks in again! The YFG is off to Peterborough with her friend. They were planning to go last week during the holidays but the friend had to have her appendix out just days before Christmas and so she has needed time to recuperate.  They are letting the train take the strain today and will not have too much walking to do as the train station is just a short walk from the big shopping centre in Peterborough. The YFG has put some of her Christmas cash into savings already, and spent some, so she will be window shopping mostly today, I believe!I'm considering a mooch to Cambridge with the EFG today. She seems to have a desperate urge to go somewhere, whereas I am content to hunker down and get stuff done at home.  I'm torn between stuff that needs to be done and wanting to keep her happy.  I have almost another two weeks with her at home before she goes back to Aberdeen on the 15th, and I will have limited time to do things specifically with her once every other routine commitment kicks in again, so if the weather bucks up this morning, we will be off later!Tomorrow afternoon will be a gathering of aunt and uncles here for a cup of tea - UJ and his brother and brother's wife and daughter will be here with daughter's husband.  Follow that? Well done!  We haven't seen some of that gang for a while so it is a good chance to catch up and for them to see the EFG too.  The Boxing Day cousins of the FH will probably want to come over again before she goes back, and I know my dad will want to see her again too!  I think next weekend might be busy with visitors as well......and I have a service to take.....better get organised this week!Yesterday I had a little extravagance and bought a new shredder. I know I said I was decluttering, and I am, but you can't get rid of mountains of confidential paperwork without a shredder!  We did have one and it stopped working ages ago, so the papers that need shredding have been building up...time to have a clear out of those. This shredder also niftily cross cuts the papers so that we end up with short choppy bits rather than long curls - much easier to deal with, I think, and I am pleased with the purchase - shredding will commence tomorrow, I think.The decluttering slowed down a little on Thursday with only about 20 items identified, and yesterday there were only 2 - and one of them an accident!  I had a lovely Swinnerton's flowery serving dish which was pretty ancient and I loved it.  The EFG managed to knock it onto the kitchen floor and it broke into about 5 pieces, so that is one less item in the kitchen.  Eternally positive, the YFG immediately related it to the decluttering and said, \"Well, that's one item for your list today!\"  That wasn't quite how I was planning this operation......Hoping you all have a great weekend - and thanks for your comments, and emails.  It is humbling to read how much some of you are inspired by my ramblings!  Thank you xxx"},

We were friends on Facebook until she decided not to use that platform any longer, and now we connect through emails, usually at Christmas, when we catch up on one another's news.  It was a lovely way to start the day this morning, with a bishop's blessing to get me through the first day back to early starts and working again!If you are back to work today, I hope it is a good day for you too xx"},

A £4.50 joint fed four of us very generously today and there is plenty left for the three of us tomorrow.  That sounds like good value to me.  (image from groceries.morrisons.com)UJ stayed until later in the evening, and helped out with the Christmas jigsaw - it is a very slow process, but we are plugging away at it.  The girls have been watching the EFG's boxset of Modern Family and reached the end tonight - what a relief!(image from en.wikipedia.org)I've been pottering about, chatting with a friend via text, tidying my desk up ready for the work to begin again tomorrow, and doing some more decluttering.  We have sorted out over 390 items already and I am looking forward to another run to the charity shops tomorrow afternoon when I have to take the YFG to an appointment.  Thanks for all your comments and support this Christmas.First day of the new year has been a good one - I feel ready for 2015!"},
{"title": "And what a year it has been....", "date": "Wednesday 31 December 2014", "text": "We've had a heck of a ride through 2014 in many ways, and it has had its ups and downs.  Much of the year has been centred around the EFG and her applications and visits to various universities, and the A level exams which were so important to get her where she wanted to go.  Finances, forms and results were all in the mix.  She got there, though, and is enjoying life in Aberdeen.  Good result.From April and May onwards, we had to face the reality of the FH's declining health when the Papworth cardiology consultant wrote the word \"terminal\" in a letter, and we had to talk and think about that one.  His decline had been gradual but it seemed to accelerate then, and he spent time in hospital in June, and again in early July, which sadly marked his death, the day before he was going to come home. He knew he would be coming home to die, but hoped to do it here with us.  I wouldn't have denied him that, but in my heart of hearts, I know that his death at home would have been traumatic for us all.  Our friends and family supported us, and we made it through the funeral and the days in between which seemed so busy and yet so empty without him.And since then, we have been in recovery mode.  We have had to find new ways of getting on with life and new routines.The EFG has left home in a way, although it has been great to have her back for the holidays.  Most of the time it is just the YFG and me here, and we have a settled, quiet life most of the time. Few disagreements, co-operation and mutual support and encouragement make for a peaceful time.My new job is a tiding-me-over kind of commitment, and although it is not an inspirational occupation, it brings in some cash each month, and the part-time aspect of it is enabling me to continue with the other things in my life which are important to me.I have made it to the last section of the Faith and Worship course this month, and actually sent two unit assignments to the tutor, which feels like a major achievement.  I have just 4 units more to get done and I shall be submitting the whole section to the HQ for marking in March, I hope!So what do I hope 2015 will bring?A bit more time for this:and perhaps a little more of this than I had time for lately:I also want to go back here in the summer as we didn't get there this year:but mostly, I wish for good health and happiness for all those I love!  Much the same as you and your family, I would think.Happy New Year!"},

I watched the first two and got inspired to have a thorough chuck out!  I challenged myself and thought it would be a good aim to clear 1000 items out of the house in 2015.I think I shall be re-negotiating that target with myself very shortly as I started only yesterday with my bedroom, and already 178 things have new destinations - the hallway looks like a left-luggage area with bags ready to be packed in to the car for taking to the charity shops, to the dump and to friends who I know will appreciate odd items, like the FH's Bond DVDs which are going to a wee friend who used to like to borrow them!(image from visitingeu.com)Twelve more items added to the pile this morning, so I think I may have to go for the 1000 items by the end of January!I talked to the YFG about this and we agreed that the overall target is that there are 1000 fewer items in the house by the end of the challenge, so for every non-consumable item that comes in, two have to go out.  Makes me think harder!My bedroom is transformed already - and I love it!"},
{"title": "Just a wee one", "date": "Monday 29 December 2014", "text": "A wee moan, I am afraid!  People in real life do mean well, and I take a deep breath and smile every time, but I am getting a bit pained at all the folk who are telling me how hard Christmas is for me, and how they are thinking of me.  I do appreciate the thoughts, I really do, but the woman who said to me on Sunday how hard it was for me, to whom I replied that no, the girls and I are doing well and we are having a good Christmas really wound me up when she said, \"Aren't the girls upset about their dad, then?\" No one has the right to make comments like that. No one.  It seems that hardly anyone can understand this family and how we tick.  We had been prepared for the FH to die for years, and we had openly spoken to the girls about life \"after Dad\", it was part of conversation around here.  We all knew that his life would end years before ours.  We are realistic - always optimistic, yes, but realistic too - and we knew and we prepared ourselves and them.  Some people just don't grasp that at all. We have just had a lovely half hour sitting on my bed, laughing and joking and remembering their younger childhoods and some of the things we got up to!  We have memories to cherish and to share, and to chuckle together over when the mood takes us.  We are not miserable.  We loved him and we do miss him, but we are moving on, and not dwelling on the past.  He had a great life over seven decades, saw a lot of the world and had some amazing experiences. He was born between the wars and lived long enough to see this great technological age. He benefited from some of the most exciting developments in modern medicine.  He was a generous and clever man, and had an impact on a great many lives. But the past is the past, and my girls and I still have a future."},

Church this morning, and then lunch at my sister's house.  Slightly tricky situation there as I am not sure that I completely trust that my brother-in-law understands my dietary restrictions - he certainly didn't when we went for a BBQ there in the summer.  I am tempted to take a pot of soup along and just eat that, rather than risk repercussions later.  It's that or take a serious interest in what he is doing in the kitchen, and ask a lot of questions, which I fear may offend. Anyway, have to say that I am looking forward to cosying up to the fire when we get home again later on this afternoon, and perhaps breaking out the knitting - I haven't done any yet this holiday and I was hoping to get at least one of my projects finished this break!"},

About 3pm, we were joined by the FH's cousin and his wife and son from Peterborough.  They usually come on Boxing Day, and we had a lively time!  There was lots of chatting, work on the Christmas jigsaw, which is sadly lacking the FH's expertise this year - I had only just managed the outside border before the support cavalry arrived, but it is looking better now. I may get it done by Easter!We had tea together, games were played and lots of relaxing by the fire was enjoyed by all of us!Today, we are having a quieter day at home, and we all want to get some sorting out done: the EFG has decided that her room needs going over, there is ironing in the basket to be done, and the fridge needs to be sorted out and the leftovers made into meals for today.We are going to my sister's for lunch tomorrow, and then we will have a few more days before the New Year's festivities - there are plans for cinema and shopping trips being suggested, and the girls have friends that they want to catch up with too.  A quiet day in the midst of all of this is very welcome - I'm off to get out the ironing board and find a film to watch whilst I iron!"},

Depression was diagnosed and compounded with my mother's death one cold February. With her death remembered in February, Mother's Day not completely celebrated in March, and then trying to get through her birthday in April, spring days were hard for me. Mum loved daffodils, and I always think of her when I see themI don't suffer like that any longer - and I don't really know why, except that I decided not to one year.  Not that I had ever made a conscious decision to be miserable, but I do remember making a huge effort to be cheerful - it reminds me of that saying about \"fake it until you make it\" which is what I guess I was doing.  Mental illness is never easy, and I am not trivializing anyone else's experience of it, but I am incredibly thankful that I no longer feel that way.The New Year for me is now a huge opportunity to look forward to a brand new year, and a new chance to start afresh.  It's clean, unsullied and full of promise. I love to write lists and plans at this time of year, and fill myself with fresh hopes.  It's looking up, looking forward and looking outward. By the time the schools go back in January, we will have lived six months without the FH.  Six months.  It seems like so much longer in many ways, but I still remember it all like yesterday.  We are stronger.  We are asked every so often if we are \"coping\".  \"Coping\" to me implies just getting by. We are doing so much more than that - we are living, thriving and moving forward, just as he wanted us to do.  The EFG is doing really well at uni, the YFG is moving her life on towards GCSEs and Sixth Form, and I am working, and doing all the other things I do! (image from darkecologies.com)And so our ride, which hit the bottom of the rollercoaster last July, is climbing up and up again.  I have no idea where we will be when we hit the top of the climb, but I know that the ride is exciting and we're enjoying life again."},
{"title": "Mother Mary", "date": "Sunday 21 December 2014", "text": "Our church service this morning was centred around Mary, the mother of Jesus, and it was reflective and thoughtful. The minister was asking us to consider how difficult it can be to say \"Yes\" to God. It's funny, but modern women in this day and age are often encouraged to say, \"No\" to all sorts of things, requests and invitations for example, which come our way, in order to preserve our time, and sometimes to preserve our sanity.  We had some mini discussions in the service and I realised that the answer for me is to say, \"Yes\" to God more often, but perhaps to say, \"No\" to other people on more occasions.  This holds true, for me, in that saying \"No\" to people gives me more time and energy to say, \"Yes\" to God.How wonderful but how frightening I think it would have been for Mary.  I am amazed at the strength of her faith, and the burden she took on in being the mother of the Christ. She is blessed among women after the event, if you see what I mean, but back in the day, given the local customs, she would have been putting her life on the line.I don't believe that saying \"Yes\" to God is always easy, comfortable or without problems - I am sure that it isn't, indeed - but I know that if God wants us to do something, He does everything He can to support us in achieving whatever is His goal for us.  Sometimes we need a huge boot up the behind from God to get out there and say \"Yes, Lord, I'll do that!\"  I'm so glad that Mary had that courage.Linking with Ang at Tracing Rainbows for the Pause in Advent theme.(image from angalmond.blogspot.co.uk)"},

And I have another Sainsbury's order coming tonight.  The car is in the garage today getting serviced, and I knew that the fresh fruit and veg and fridge supplies were getting low, so I booked another £1 slot and the stocks are coming tonight.  I was disappointed that the voucher for £6 off when I spent £40 which came with the receipt for the last delivery was not usable online, so I rang up to complain - after all, why send out a store-only coupon to someone who has had an online delivery made? It didn't make a lot of sense, and it had today's date on it too, so limited time for me to get to a store.  I rang customer services to moan about it, and the good chap there took care of the order and gave me £6 off the bill, which pleased me no end!  Just goes to show what you can achieve by giving a company your opinion.I have also ordered another Calor gas bottle to be delivered today.  The company I ordered it from are holding their prices from last July [2013!] and so it is costing me just £52.30 delivered for a 47kg bottle, whereas the local garage where I used to get it is still charging £75 for the bottle and £5 to deliver!  Whoops - I think they are possibly losing some business.So some dosh is being released from captivity today - but not in an uncontrolled manner.  Spending is thought out, measured and considered, as usual.  I can't have an empty fridge when I know that there will be three of us to feed for a month, and we definitely don't want to run out of gas when we are steaming our veg on Christmas day!"},

Lack of light makes people sad; lack of money affects lots of us in all kinds of ways; lack of family and friends around us makes us feel lonely. Any lack of any kind can really have an impact on the way we feel and then on the way we treat others.Is it any wonder that we light up our homes with sparkly lights at this time of year as we look for some brightness in this dull world?  The truth is that we need the Light that is Jesus Christ all year round.  Linking today with Ang at Tracing Rainbows for the Pause in Advent series.(image from angalmond.blogspot.co.uk)"},

The cards have started to arrive, so I need to write a few for some older people, but those friends with whom we can connect on the internet have been told that we won't be sending out many cards this year, because I just can't face sitting here and writing a whole heap of cards with only three names on them......The YFG will be putting one of the trees up this weekend, and she has promised to leave one for the EFG to organise when she gets home. The main items of food are in the stores, and the presents are just about all wrapped.  It's going to be quiet, not too big and bold, but it will be OK.  It will be another achievement to have had our first Christmas without the FH: there might be a few tears now and again, but we are getting there."},
{"title": "An Aldi idea", "date": "Thursday 11 December 2014", "text": "Well, the Aldi update is that the voucher is indeed valid for the period between today and Christmas Eve, so we do have plenty of time to consider what we want to buy.Some people on the Aldi Facebook page were wondering how they would gather £75 worth of goods into their trolleys because they haven't ever managed to spend that much in Aldi before.  One suggestion was to buy what we need ourselves, and then, if we are not too far from the total, we could buy some food to donate to a local food bank - and I thought that was a lovely idea and one that would benefit a lot of folk.I'll certainly bear it in mind if we do go to Aldi in the run up to Christmas - I bought a paper just in case!One week to go until the EFG is home - next Thursday night she will be here with me by the fire, and I am really looking forward to it.  The next Thursday will be Christmas, the one after that will be New Year, and then it will all be over!  We build up to this all with such expectations that it seems, especially for the little ones, that Christmas takes for ever to arrive, but actually, there are 24 hours in every day, whether it is Christmas or not, and so the time will pass at the same speed!  I'm not wishing the time away, and indeed, I shall be trying to spin it out as long as I can when the girls are both at home and I am not at w*rk.  That is not a nice word at the moment - I have had more than my fair share of disgruntled customers in the past two days and I am not terribly chuffed about it...Keep safe in the wild and windy weather we are looking at tonight on the news - wind, snow, gales, rain, it is all coming our way tonight!"},

More days like this please!! I'd like to say that it was a no-spend day, but we had the delivery from Sainsbugs.  That was interesting - we ended up with frozen spinach instead of kale, and a bag of posh frozen roast potatoes with goose fat which we didn't order, and they haven't charged us for either.....they will come in handy at some point, I am sure.  Since they substituted some more expensive tinsel than I had ordered, I won't worry about the potatoes too much.  The chap was here early, which was great, but he had come from a shop over 30 miles away, which was unexpected, as they used to deliver from a more local store.  They gave me a £6 off when I spend £40 voucher for next week, though, which I can use in store. I have seen on Facebook tonight that the Aldi voucher will be in the papers this week. Thursday 11th December.... But it is for £15 off a £75 shop, which seems a challenge for me!  It is not long since the last voucher, It is great for some people, and those who can really stock up, to take advantage, and there are rumours that the voucher will be valid until 23rd December.....we'll have to see tomorrow - let us know if you get one?  I shall see how long it really is valid for, and I might get one if the rumours are true.Take care of yourselves in this cold and windy weather we are having - the EFG says it is getting very chilly in Aberdeen!"},

The appointment last night was for the YFG's chiropody - the lovely podiatrist spent about 45 minutes with us, sorting out the toe nails and cutting them extremely short.  I wouldn't want to do her job for love nor money, so I am grateful that there are people like her who choose to make it their career.  £37 lighter, we emerged and the YFG says that her feet do feel better - thank goodness! Let's hope we can manage her toes now that we have had a lesson.....I was taking notes, mentally.

We had lots of people there, of all ages, with children and without.  We sang carols, listened to the Christmas Story in four installments from a children's bible, and had breakout sessions where the folk went and decorated biscuits, coloured pictures and cards, tried to answer some quiz questions, played with a Lego set or a woollen set of Nativity figures, had a go at \"sticking the star on the stable\" in lieu of the \"tail on the donkey\" and generally had fun.  Older folk enjoyed interacting with the children, and participated in the activities as well.We had tea afterwards, and some folk seemed reluctant to leave, they were enjoying being with us so much!  More people turned up than I had really expected, and some of the children even dressed up as their favourite Nativity character, as I had suggested that they might in the letter and the poster.  We didn't have the full complement, but we did have Mary and a King - you've got to start somewhere!It brought some new families in to the chapel, and a lot of people did some simple things to bring Christ back into their Christmas, which was my aim.  I'm linking to Ang's blog for A Pause in Advent with this post.(Image from angalmond.blogspot.co.uk)"},

{"title": "November spending round up", "date": "Tuesday 2 December 2014", "text": "Looking back over November, things haven't gone too badly, if you overlook the glasses! (image from supplierlist.com)After the specs, everything else is pretty much OK for our average November.  A little less usually hits the savings in November as I buy gifts and a little extra here and there.I expect it.  It doesn't go onto the credit cards.  It doesn't get out of hand.So, I spent a little more than I have been spending on food, but I included the 5 bird roast [£9.99] and a bottle of sloe gin [£10.50] from Aldi in the total, which are special buys for Christmas.  The \"chook\" column in the spreadsheet is a little higher than usual because it was the month I bought the worming pellets for the girls and they are £14.95 instead of £7.80 but I do that once a quarter.Toiletries is low again this month - Aldi still didn't have the lovely pink shower gel in again this month, or that total would have been higher.  They had stacks of Tea tree and mint, and we are a bit fed up of that, so I grabbed the last two zingy lime ones and left it at that. If they had had the raspberry one in, I might have bought half a dozen!  I found some Always in Sainsbury's this month and the spend was almost entirely on them - the packs have two more pads in, and the price was just £2 a pack, so I stocked up!The \"Books/Gifts/DVDs\" column is also high this month - I wonder why that could be?!  But all the gifts are here, wrapped and secreted away, so that side of things is sorted.  And we haven't gone mad in that department either: bargain books have been found on the Book People website for some small friends who love sticker books, and we had cashback through Quidco for those, as well as buying them on a day that the website had a promotional code on offer!I have used my four \"£6 off when you spend £40\" Sainsbury's vouchers, and have also scanned the extra coupon, so my bonus 5000 Nectar points should hit my account within 28 days.  Some of the gifts have also been bought with Clubcard and Nectar points on their respective Double-up schemes, which has helped quite a bit - the YFG wanted a dressing gown and a jumper so they came courtesy of the vouchers.  I have also used my Shop'n'Scan points to get some Amazon vouchers.  An unexpected expense this month has been a new toilet seat for the family bathroom.  It broke completely and wouldn't stay on the hinges so it had to go.  The YFG had her heart set on a fishy seat, so we now have tropical fish on the toilet seat in that bathroom, courtesy of B&Q on Sunday.  It took quite a bit of looking in local shops to find one, and we had to go a little further afield to be successful!(image from diy.com)If it lasts as long as the first one (10 years) I won't be able to complain!December is looking stable, so far, and I shall begin to stash money towards car expenses at the end of January....insurance and tax on my Skoda are due and I shall top up the savings account this month and next towards that.  I still have the FH's little Fiesta but that will not be insured or taxed now until we want to use it again or sell it.  How are your festive finances looking?"},

We are more than getting by.  God blesses us with friends [and family, most of the time!] who love us and support us.  Just like they always did.  The YFG still loves Sherlock, I still adore soppy films, and love my chooks, and life goes on.  A bit fast at times, but it goes on."},

The EFG had a little bonus yesterday when one of her Premium Bonds came up in Ernie's draw - a cheque for £25 arrived for her so I have sent that northwards so that she can pay it into her account.  She was very pleased to hear that last evening - she has another cold, so it cheered her up."},

The day was a long one, with a 7.30am trip to school this morning, and then not getting home until just past 5pm.  The day was kind, too, in that we had a lot of support from friends and family in real life here, with regards to the FH's birthday.  Lots of messages on Facebook, some emails, phone calls and texts have arrived.  I had a long chat on the phone with one of his sisters in the evening, and his cousin rang yesterday too.  We feel secure and loved.  We miss him, of course we do, but we are OK.And you will be pleased to hear that since I was up at 5am, I put my feet up in the afternoon when I had done the ironing, and watched some of the very first episodes of Downton Abbey.  I didn't watch the first series properly, so it was interesting.  I do believe I may have dropped off for a minute or two as well.  I also managed to get the second sock cast on as well!I did spend some money yesterday - we decided on a book for one of the YFG's friends for Christmas, from the Book People catalogue.  Not only did I go through Quidco to get 8% cashback, but there was a 15% off code till midnight so I saved a nice chunk of that wee spend."},

(image by allstar on theguardian.com)Well, I would have settled for a DVD and lighting the fire, but the YFG is strangely persuasive and we ended up at the cinema to see The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch [above] ably supported by Kiera Knightly and a host of other stars including Charles Dance and Allen Leech.It was \"free\" in as much as we had some Clubcard vouchers and a voucher acquired a while back from buying a couple of bags of sweeties!  So we didn't pay for the tickets, and we didn't buy the over-priced popcorn and drinks either.The story is based on the real life experiences of Alan Turing, a mathematician and cryptologist from the University of Cambridge.  I shan't spoil the ending for those who want to go to see it, but take a tissue or two.  It is quite brilliantly made, and very well acted.We have had a meal tonight which always makes me think of the FH and his heart transplant. I was just putting a meal out on the plates the day that he had the call, and the entire meal went straight in the bin as we had no time to waste - we had to get to the hospital and he was forbidden to eat another morsel, of course.  That meal was a boiled bacon joint, with veg including broad beans and potatoes.  That's what we have had tonight - and thought of him.  He would have been 76 tomorrow, so we will be thinking of him, and remembering the good days.And for now - we're by the fire, watching the opening credits of War Horse.  Seems like today will be a double bill of Benedict........and another war story."},

I thought it was going to cost £25, but it was only £20 in the event.  I shall see how I feel tomorrow......he said I might feel washed out for a day or so!And then I let the YFG head off to Peterborough to buy her Christmas present.  Yes, you read that right. You might think it's weird, but it works for us.  The girls know what they are getting, and they look forward to opening their gifts and taking ownership.  The YFG wanted a particular pair of shoes and we looked online for them, but there didn't seem to be any available in her size so it seemed to be the best thing for her to go to the shop and try them on!  She went on her own this afternoon, and it was a very valuable experience for her.  She has to get over the idea that everyone in the shopping centre is looking at her and thinking she's sad because she's on her own - and she took the challenge today.  I was so proud of her when she came home with her purchases.  Now we are having a quiet night watching Strictly and relaxing.  I'm not sure how tomorrow evening is going to look - I shall miss Downton Abbey dreadfully and I hate the jungle programme with a passion!!"},
{"title": "Yardage", "date": "Thursday 13 November 2014", "text": "Spot the difference between these two beds?(image from technabob.com)What do you think?  (image from imgora.com)The most significant difference for me is the way that the covers on the second bed really hang over the edge.  There is more yardage there, I think.Bear with me - there is a point to this.  I was changing the sheets on our beds today, and I was thinking about what makes my bed so cosy and appealing, and I realised that it is because I have a king-size duvet on a double bed, so there is plenty of duvet to hang down over the edges and really keep me very snug.  There is no skimping and no danger of drafts!It occurred to me later on, when I was hanging the king-sized duvet cover on the washing line to dry, and cursing the unwieldiness of the thing, that that yardage theory about the duvet being more secure and less drafty might equally apply to our finances, or our savings in particular. A double bed strictly speaking needs a double duvet.  A single wouldn't really be a lot of good.  A king-size one is just that bit more comfortable.I was having a discussion with the YFG last night about holidays.  She would love to go to Canada, Africa, France, Australia, America, and all sorts of places!  I did agree to consider Dorset, Devon or Cornwall IF we get any further than Norfolk next year.  She knows that I have some savings, and to her young mind, I could afford a bigger holiday than I claim to be able to afford.But those savings are our yardage.  They are what make life comfortable here, and stop us from feeling that we are living life on the bare minimum, on the edge, so to speak.They give us security and keep the drafts [worries] at bay.Some people would say that they can't make any savings, and that they have only enough coming in each week or month to get by.  I'm not naive and I do know that there are really people out there for whom that is the truth.  Unfortunately, there is another whole group of people who are making choices which they could change, which would in turn allow them to develop a savings plan and make life that little bit more secure.  If you can save up just a few pounds a week or a month into a little emergency fund, then you have made a small start on making your life more comfortable.  We all have to start somewhere, and like our grannies used to say, \"look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves\". It is very true that getting in to the habit of saving a few pence here and there will soon help you to build up a wee nest egg.  I'm preaching to the choir here I know, but if it spurs someone on to make a start, all the better. Elaine over at Mortgage Free in Three has some wonderfully thrifty ideas for saving money and would be a wonderful resource for anyone making a start on an emergency fund.Weird the thoughts that pop into one's mind over the washing machine, eh?!"},

{"title": "Voucher fun", "date": "Tuesday 11 November 2014", "text": "Vouchers are all around us - most of the major supermarkets have offers on at the moment, and some are quite complicated to understand.  (image from bbc.co.uk)Morrison's are banking on us collecting vouchers over several weeks in order to claim a saving on our Christmas shop, Tesco are offering £5 off our next £40 shop when we spend £40 now, and there is the regular Aldi voucher in the newspapers.  Are you managing to keep track of the offers that affect you and your shopping?And then there are the non-grocery offers too!I have had to stop and think, and read the small print.  I've dismissed Morrison's because I just don't have access to that shop very easily and I couldn't commit to visiting one on a regular basis.  I looked into their delivery service, but they aren't covering our area just yet.Tesco are actually asking me to spend £80 in order to save £5 because I have to spend the initial £40 in order to get the voucher for the next week.......not such a good deal.Aldi I do support most months, and I grab that voucher from the newspaper to stock up on staples and toiletry items.But the one I am planning to make the best use of this season?  Sainsbury's has sent me four vouchers - for free with no qualifying spend to get the voucher - each one for £6 off when I spend £40.  And it includes everything in the shop apart from alcohol, so when I used one yesterday, the £9.99 that the YFG spent on a DVD with her babysitting cash counted towards it.  I split the savings with her!  And the best bit? If I am consistent, and use all four of the vouchers, I will receive a boost to my Nectar points - 5000 points added to the balance within 28 days.  Not in time for the Christmas shop, perhaps, but still a boost for us to use!  I have also had an email from Amazon, letting me know that buying a £20 gift card would bring me a £5 promotional code to use on my purchases.  I bought the gift card because I had other Amazon vouchers and knew that I would be making purchases there for the girls - so an extra £5 bonus was a \"no-brainer\" as they say.  I exchanged the cash that I would have spent for a voucher, and then just used the voucher and the bonus to make the purchases last night.I'm almost done with the Christmas shopping, thank goodness, but I am not doing much of it this year."},

I'm still hankering after a cottage pie too, but I am not sure that there is any mince left in the freezer.  I shall have to get out there and have another rummage to see what I can find.  If I haven't got any left, corned beef hash will be a close approximation to get us through the week!And on the other nights of the week?  Leftovers, and portions of previously home made meals from the freezer!"},

At that part of the day, there were representatives from all of the chapels in the circuit, and we had the chance to listen to her talking about her life and her witness, and a little bit about what makes her tick.  She is a very interesting lady.After about 45 minutes, she left with her husband to return to her current circuit home in Leeds, and the committee considered whether she would be the right minister for us.I'm a little surprised about all this, as it was my first time on the invitations committee for our chapel.  We don't have the opportunity to hear her preach, or lead worship.  We have to make the decision based on a quick chat in our chapel and then another brief meeting with her - all over in about 90 minutes.  SO different from other denominations.  I know that the Methodist Church already employs her and we are just calling her to serve with us, but it is a responsibility to get an impression of someone in so short a time.She seems keen to come to the Fens, and we have asked our senior circuit steward to tell her that we are interested in her coming to us, so we have to wait and give her time to prayerfully consider whether we are the right place for her.......So I am glad that I am very nearly ready for tomorrow. I left the YFG painting some white paper red as I didn't have time to buy red paper for tomorrow's poppy activity at the chapel, so we had to improvise, and since we had red paint in already, that seemed like a good plan.  Now to consider what an individual poppy petal might look like, and to cut some out. It is raining cats and dogs here tonight, and so I haven't ventured out yet to close the hen house doors.  I'm waiting for a lull in the downpours. Take care and keep warm this weekend xxx"},

I have also decided that I feel better in myself when I knit more - and I haven't touched a knitting needle all week.Trouble is, that I am not feeling so great just lately, and I know I have no one else to blame but me.So for this week, less junk in and more knitting output, and we'll see how it goes.I've been thinking about reducing commitments now that I have a job, and it is going to be SO hard to think about what to stop doing, but I am slowly coming to the conclusion that it might be the school governing that has to go......I don't want to do that, but sometimes, there has to be a higher consideration.  I'm going to keep thinking about that one for a little bit longer."},

They will go down very well with some jam for pudding for him and the YFG tonight.  I also grabbed some bacon lardons that I had portioned up and we can have those in the risotto that is definitely on the menu today.(image from theguardian.com)I have just spent a while on the phone with the EFG and on the computer on The Train Line website, working out train times and prices with her.  She had bought a standard advance return ticket for the 20th December, but it now turns out she can come home on the 18th, so we set to and looked for other tickets.  By a stroke of luck, I found singles that come to £40 less than she paid for the return.  She will have to pay a £10 admin charge to change the ticket, but she should still be £30 to the good. She is hotfooting it down to the station now, with a print out from the web site, in order to try to secure the cheaper tickets.  I do hope it all works out, as two extra days with her are a bonus!"},

Train fares would be needed for Peterborough and either bus or train for Cambridge - all to be considered.The final decision will be a case of which place offers the courses, and the combination of courses she wants to do, and at which we feel she will achieve the most, in the happiest way!"},

I have a bag of jacket potatoes languishing under the sink in the kitchen cupboard, so I know jackets will be on the menu at least once this week.  An easy supper with a tin of beans or tuna, and not too much washing up!I shall give UJ a portion of home made tomato soup for his tea on Wednesday, accompanied with a beautiful home made miniature cottage loaf bread roll which I was given last night.  There is a wonderful baker at the church I was at last night, and he gave me some bread rolls to bring home, but the YFG thought that the rolls were too substantial for her lunch box, but they will go down well with some soup. I have popped them in the freezer to keep them fresh, but I know UJ will enjoy them.  And that will be another plastic container out of the freezer on Wednesday!I didn't get my sweet and sour chicken last week, but the YFG isn't keen, so I may not get it this week either.......unless I have it one night, freeze a portion or two. She could have scampi whilst I have that.  But hey!

{"title": "Packing", "date": "Friday 31 October 2014", "text": "Since some of you have been kind enough to support my endeavours with the Operation Christmas Child boxes, I thought you might like to see the almost-finished results!We have got the official boxes this year - they arrived flat and the YFG had a merry hour one night whilst I was working, and she folded and slotted 25 of them together for me. I've had a lot of the bits and bobs that we are putting in them sitting around for a while, and it has been a relief to start getting the boxes packed tonight!So, if we open the lid, we have a fairly typical assortment of things in this box for a 5-9 year old girl.There's a hat and scarf which the FH's cousin's wife knitted with some wool that UJ brought me. He found it in his loft, which means that it must date from my mum's crocheting days - and she died in 1998, so it is time it was used!There is a wee packet of sweets, a couple of hair clips, a stuffed toy, a card game, a notepad, and a sealed bag with 2 biros, 2 pencils, a rubber and a sharpener and a packet of pencil crayons.  We can't run to pencil cases but I thought that the children might appreciate a grip lock bag to keep their bits together in. All that will be added tomorrow will be the toiletry pack - a flannel, soap, toothbrush and toothpaste.  I am waiting for a friend to bring the flannels in the morning!We are so very nearly there, and then they can be delivered to the local church in town which is organising the collection this year.Today is the end of October, and perhaps would have been the end of the focused money saving challenge, but then I had to go to the optician's yesterday afternoon.Are you sitting down?  You need to be.  I'm having to get older-lady glasses this time - my first pair of varifocals.  Who knew how much they would be? I certainly hadn't a clue.  Good lenses? Over £250.  Then there's the sight test, and the frames.  No change out of £400.I can see fine at this kind of distance:(image from ayrshireeyeclinic.com)but it is starting to get a bit tricky when I am about here:(image from motivationalmemo.com)and when I am looking closely at this level, well, it's better to just take the flipping glasses off at the moment:(image from theknitter.co.uk)There is no doubt in my mind that I need the new glasses.So, our money saving challenge will have to roll onwards into November.  We'll keep a close eye on the spending,  and we'll be putting the £400 back into the savings pot as fast as we can.  The amount I had hoped to increase the savings by in this month will probably have to whistle!  It's going to be a challenge to break even.But let's count our blessings: I have the money to buy the glasses, and I have the ways and means to replace it.  I don't have to put it on a credit card or take out a payday loan to finance the purchase.  It's all good, really.  And isn't life a bit boring without a challenge or two to keep us on our toes?!"},
{"title": "Rotations", "date": "Thursday 30 October 2014", "text": "As we move towards November, I'm reflecting on the success of my challenge to spend less and use up some of the stocks in the house in an attempt to save a little money this month. The freezers are still pretty full, but I would attribute that to the influx of cooked pears which has been put into them this month - when UJ brings trays of Conference pears, one can't eat them all at once and it is necessary to peel, core and cook them, and then freeze them in a little juice in small 500g margerine tubs.  I think that there are about 15 such tubs now out there!  I love pears so they will not be wasted this winter.The store cupboards are not too empty yet, although there are some stocks which are running down and I am not going to replace them.  The stash of pickles is slowing being given away to friends and neighbours now that the FH is not here to enjoy them.  I shan't be buying any further HP or Worcestershire sauces either, and gave the last bottle of each to the Harvest auction at the chapel. So have I saved any money?  Yes, but I have spent it!  I have had a handyman from the village here this month and he has transformed my block paved driveway back to how it was 10 years ago when we moved in!  It was littered with weeds in the cracks between the paviers, and at the side were some hugely overgrown lavender bushes.   Some of the blocks had dropped and were uneven in places.  And it is a large area - there is room to park about 6 cars out there, so we are not talking about a small area.  He has cleaned it all up, pressure washed it and removed all the weeks, taken the lavender bushes out, laid weed membrane down on that area and put down gravel.  The dropped blocks have all been levelled out as well.  It looks great and is a huge weight off my mind now.   I am so pleased with it that every time I drive the car in or out,  I have a little look at it all!  Money very well spent. The EFG spent the evening with the gang at the flat last night, and had a good time by all accounts, catching up with the YFG and chatting.  I started my new knitting project and I am quite pleased with my progress last night - I knitted solidly for 2 hours whilst I watched an Inspector Lynley mystery on one of the Freeview channels.  I shall reveal what it is when it is finished, as right now it doesn't look much like what it is destined to become!"},

I just sat with her, hugged her, and listened to her.  There wasn't a lot more I could do, although I did leave our funeral director's number with her partner, as they were so brilliant for us in the summer and I know that they would deal with this sensitively and with the greatest level of care.  Lots of prayers will be going her way, and I know that most of the village has been thinking of her - the lawn in the front of her house was a little sea of flowers and candles last night.Here, my time is quite peaceful.  I have been awake since just before 8am and been busy getting things crossed off the housework list, before I start work in a few minutes. I have two services to prepare for Sunday, although I am recycling one in a sort of variation for the evening service I am taking in the north of the circuit.  It still needs work on it though, and I hope to get some work done on those this afternoon.Today will be a no spend day, like yesterday - the village shop and post office is shut for refurbishment and I have no plans to leave the village today at all, so a quiet, home-based day is on the cards.  Might even start a new knitting project later!"},

{"title": "Mystery solved", "date": "Friday 24 October 2014", "text": "My stepson's whereabouts have come to light!  His girlfriend went to his flat last night to feed his animals, and found his phone there, so that explains why he wasn't answering it.She managed to get hold of the solicitor at lunch time, and found out that my stepson was sent to prison yesterday for a two year sentence.  Why on earth the solicitor didn't let her know that yesterday, we don't know.  That was very frustrating and she said that he didn't seem very interested.  She is going to call the prison and find out what the visiting arrangements are.  We think he is in a local prison, so not far to travel, as long as they keep him there.She understands that he may have to serve half of this sentence.  But she has a lot of things to sort out with the flat, and all his possessions may have to be moved out of the flat, as it is a housing association property and the rent will not get paid whilst he is in the prison.  I will help her as much as I can. Yesterday, after doing some work in the morning, I set off on a spree!  And what a good day it was too, in that respect.  I travelled from the flat prairie-like land of the Fens, to the altogether more attractive Stamford, town of the famous \"George Inn\" and beautiful stone houses - almost something from a television historical drama.  It is a lovely town.I met up with Sweet Blondie Blue Eyes and her husband at Morrison's for a cup of tea, and had a wonderful hour with them.  I have been in touch with SBBE for a few years now and purchased some of her sewing before, as well as asking her to custom-make me some bean bags for gymnastics.  It was the first time we had met in person, though. We had been planning to meet in June when the FH had an appointment at Stamford hospital for the palliative care doctor, but we had to cancel that as it was one of the days he was admitted to the hospital in a hurry.  It was good to meet at last, albeit a bit sad because the FH didn't make it to meet them too.  I did take them an order of service from the funeral as they had been planning to come to the funeral when SBBE's husband was taken ill himself that day.Chatting, munching, reminiscing, the hour or so soon passed and we were on our separate paths home again - but I do hope to do it again one day!  I was glad that I had some photos of the girls on my phone that I could share with them, and of course, they didn't know what I looked like - but SBBE helpfully told me she would be wearing a red hat and coat and would wait by the front door so I recognised her immediately.It was brilliant to have a bit of an away-day from everything and just to be me!  I enjoy driving so the 40 mile trip was a pleasure and the weather today made the scenery over that way all the more attractive.  I am ashamed to say that there is one less pheasant on the roads today, though, as it just didn't move and I couldn't swerve as there was a car coming the other way. Back to the grindstone when I got home again last night, spending another 90 minutes on the phone making the calls that are my new job."},

Just lately, since I have started the new job, I have had to find something different to do for twenty minutes or half an hour whilst I have a cup of tea in between sessions on the computer, and sometimes I do things like pushing the hoover around or hanging out the washing, but other times, I take the time to just sit and knit.....and it is great! Some time ago, I remember reading on Rhonda's blog at Down To Earth that she and Hanno take time each morning to stop for morning tea together, and just take some time to relax for a few minutes, and I think that that is a great idea.I have just started, in the last two weeks, to make a weekly list of jobs I need to do - things like the cleaning chores, cleaning out the chooks and the rabbit, paperwork and bills that need attention - and making sure that I try to get most of them crossed off by the end of the week.  Today I have cleaned the bathrooms, completed the ironing and put it away in the airing cupboard, changed the beds and cut the front lawn, for example, so I feel satisfied that I have done some of the jobs on the list, even though there are plenty of things left for the rest of the week!I think pacing oneself is the name of the game!  Knitting keeps me out of mischief and away from the shops too....."},

Walking around the house and turning off appliances on standby, not leaving the phone chargers on any longer than necessary, never leaving the tv on standby, making the laptop hibernate or turning it off properly when I am going to be leaving it for some time, using low-energy light bulbs, not using the oven much at all and making sure it is full when we do use it, and just washing full loads of laundry.  When we have a casserole or a joint of meat, it  has become simple to pop it in the slow cooker, and enjoy the aroma of the cooking all day!  Froogs has had plenty of slow cooker recipes on her blog this month, so do hop over to Frugal Queen and have a look.  I have my eye on a recipe for pulled pork which I think that the EFG will enjoy when she is home. Sadly, the biggest difference is the people who are not here, and the greatest impact on the usage is actually the fact that there are just the two of us here now.  I do expect a spike in the electricity usage when the EFG is home at Christmas.  It will be worth it to have her home for nearly a month, though!"},

It was aspirational to hope that we could manage the month on £100 for everything, and I confess here and now that I think we have spent that already.  I wasn't going to deny the YFG slippers and new underwear when she needed them just for the sake of this.  We are thinking more carefully, though, which is always a good thing.Helping out the lady that I posted about yesterday makes me realise how lucky we are, and how very blessed we are.  I read a post about real poverty on Frugaldom the other week and it really made the point that however hard up we feel, we are not!  There has also been an exhibition of photos of real poverty in this country in the sixties and seventies, and seeing those on the internet has made me think hard about what I want to do to help people more.Real poverty is hard. Relative poverty is another thing, I think, and a lot of people think that they are \"poor\" because they cannot have the things that they see other people enjoying. So we are considering purchases, we are using up some stuff, we are monitoring and metering, and generally being more thoughtful.  It has been a blessing to be able to use some of the savings and some of the stash to help someone else.  I shall try to carry on throughout the month to do more of the same.  We have some big bills coming up at the end of the month for the tv licence [that's a whole debate of its own!] and the house insurance...."},

{"title": "Day out", "date": "Sunday 12 October 2014", "text": "When I came home from chapel this morning, I acted on impulse and offered the YFG a day out at the Autumn Show at the Peterborough showground.  We had been to the show regularly for years, as exhibitors, selling Usborne Books, and then with poultry in the poultry sale there.  It was quite different today, going as normal punters!One of my favourite parts of the show has always been the Giant Vegetables!  We saw some amazing specimens today.A very weird carrot.I thought of SimpleSuffolkSmallholder and her own enormous pumpkins when I saw this one!We saw some beautiful chickens in the chicken exhibits, and this was one of my favourites.  Giant cabbages - really really big!  I have no idea how many people one of those would feed but it would be more than your average family of four!Leek for soups aplenty.We watched this chap for nearly half an hour - the Dog and Duck show - and it was really entertaining and informative. It helped me to understand more about dog behaviour in just half an hour!  When we got home this afternoon, the YFG snuggled up with a fleece blanket to begin with, but we thought it was a perfect day to light the fire for the first time this season, and we have had a lovely evening by the fire.  Some knitting has been done, the ironing has been completed, and Downton Abbey has been watched.  Time to head off to bed, I think!"},
{"title": "Always learning", "date": "Saturday 11 October 2014", "text": "I've had a revelation today, and I am sure some of you will chuckle to yourselves and wonder why I didn't already know the first one!The YFG's school changed her PE uniform last September so that instead of a plain white polycotton polo shirt and some shorts, they now have a posh \"skort\" and a polyester top. Unfortunately, the top is not the most ideal thing for wearing when you are perspiring heavily, doing sport, and it has begun to be a bit whiffy!  I washed it this morning and when I went to hang it up in the verandah, it wasn't very pleasant at all.  I had to come and google how to get sweaty smells out of gym gear, and sure enough, good old vinegar was the top recommendation.I know all about using vinegar as a softener in the washing machine, but since I actually prefer rough towels, I have never bothered particularly with worrying about softening my laundry, so I hadn't tried it.  I rewashed the top by hand and then popped it in the washer on a quick rinse cycle, with half a cup of vinegar in the fabric conditioner dispenser drawer and it worked!  Came out as fresh as a daisy - I shall definitely be doing that again.And my second lesson of the day?  I found a fab song on Youtube for my service in the morning, but needed to be able to download the video on to the laptop in order to use it, because we don't have any internet access at the chapel.  A quick visit to my tech friend up the road, and a lesson on keepvid and I am sorted.  I shall be able to use it to download gymnastics videos as well to teach the kids at gym.  Very pleased with that lesson!We've had a foul thunderstorm here this afternoon where the heavens opened and the rain came down in torrents, along with hailstones.  There was a carpet of ice on the lawn when I walked back from the computer guy's house, and I got wet feet because I had gone out in my dry weather walking boots - they have cracks in the soles but they are so comfortable that I refuse to part with them.  Part of my Hawkshead haul, I have been wearing them daily now for about three years, so they don't owe me a penny - they were the FH's and I had a blue pair: I wore mine out and he never wore his, so I took them over about three years back and never let him have them again!I popped in to Lidl this morning and used the voucher. I spent just over the £30 and stocked up on some things we needed alongside a couple of items to make the amount up to £30 which we will use in the months ahead.  Lidl dry cat biscuits, which the cat loves, were reduced from 99p/kg to 89p/kg so I bought three boxes of those!  There were some good bargains alongside Lidl's usual good prices. We should be set for the week now.  Glad to read that some of you were able to make good use of the voucher, and I spread the word amongst some real life friends too - times are getting tough for some of them and they were pleased to hear about the voucher.  I think I am getting a reputation here as the one who knows about vouchers!  Not a bad thing."},
{"title": "Lidl voucher", "date": "Friday 10 October 2014", "text": "Just a quick one tonight about a Lidl voucher.  There is a Facebook page for Lidl, and for those people who have \"liked\" the page, there is a voucher for £5 off when you spend £30 there this weekend.  It is very specifically only valid on Saturday and Sunday, so if you are likely to be able to benefit from that, and you have a Facebook account, I would recommend that you head over there and download the voucher! For those of you not on Facebook, there is a link to another website which is sharing the information HERE and you may find it easier to access. If I can make tomorrow's shop quite precise at £30, I shall achieve my target of spending £25 or less each week this month.  Calculator at the fore, I think.  At the moment, my list only has garlic on it, so I shall have to have a look through the cupboards and see whether we even need to go shopping! Have a good weekend, and thanks for being here this week - just like a minister friend says, \"it wouldn't be the same without you!\"I have had a good week with our not-spending challenge so far, although there will be a few fresh items that we need to pick up this weekend.  The YFG embraced the challenge last Saturday when we went shopping: I told her that we had to stick to a budget, and she made sensible choices about the things we needed, compromising over things she would really have liked in order to stay within the budget.  A very useful lesson for a teenager, I thought, and well done on her part.  I hope she is as enthusiastic this weekend!In fact, the only time I have opened my purse these last couple of days has been to put money INTO it, when I sold some eggs to the ladies at the jigsaw group at the chapel yesterday afternoon.We are eating from the freezer this week, and it is going well - I am going to cook up some mince this morning for spag bol and cottage pie, and then when we come home from gym tonight, we will just cook some veg and pasta for today's meal, and tomorrow I can pop some potato on the top of the other half of the mince, and tomorrow's dinner will be done too. Last night, I sat and finished the hat that had been languishing on my needles for a month or so, and I also enjoyed writing some letters.  Since the FH died, people have been putting pen to paper and actually sending me letters and cards through snail mail, and it has been really lovely to read their letters.  I have enjoyed writing back to some of them, and there are a few still to go, but I am getting there, and loving it.  Being able to hold a letter in your hand and read, re-read and reflect, is a blessing.  The kindness of people continues, and it is a great help to know that others are thinking of us, however they communicate that with us."},

Just a short note to those of you who would like to contribute knitted hats to our Operation Christmas Child boxes - would you be able to let me have what you have done by the end of the month, please?  We need to know how many boxes we are going to be able to fill, and it sort of depends on the hat situation - we can make scarves very quickly from fleece throws, but hats take a wee bit more time!I have had an army of people knitting - old church friends who have moved away, the FH's cousin's wife, a few neighbours, and some of the ladies at the chapel group, but not many....and I've knitted some, but not as many as I managed last year.  A very heartfelt thank you to you all.I've perked up a little, and life is not looking quite as hard work as it felt at the weekend.  These ups and downs are going to come and go, I think, and I thank all of you for your wise words and kindness."},

{"title": "Four days in", "date": "Sunday 5 October 2014", "text": "We've been shopping this weekend with a carefully prepared list - not!  Unfortunately, it was not well planned at all, and we went round the supermarket on a wing and a prayer......We did know what we didn't want, which was a big help - we have loads of meat, frozen fruit, bread and some veg in the freezers.  And I had a plan in the back of my mind about some meals for the week ahead, having vague recollections of what meat we have. All in all, it was probably a lesson in how NOT to do the shopping!The EFG loves peas, but we realised this week that we had to move over to frozen from tinned, because she can't eat a whole tin at a time, and never fancies them again the next day, so it is going to be more economical to be able to get a smaller amount out of the freezer.  She loves her chips too, and it is better to have some frozen ones available rather than to have to rely on having some potatoes suitable for chips here.  I did know that I needed some staples - onions and bananas for a start.I have picked up a tip in the good old Facebook this week - and I am ashamed that I hadn't already realised!  I picked up a bunch of bananas, and weighed them: they were 68p/kg, and the bunch cost me 56p yet a very similar bunch already wrapped in a bag were £1.  I had being buying the £1 bagged bunches and thinking that they were good value - how daft have I been!  No more wrapped bananas for us.  That's 44p saved today.All in all a spend of £25.58 in the supermarket, and then another £4.99 in the hardware store.......The wood burner has had its chimney swept and had a minor repair and so been declared fit to go this season.  Still, it looked a little bit the worse for wear and UJ recommended a coat of blackleading.  It's now called Black Stove Polish, but it is basically graphite and does the same job.  The tube cost £4.99 but will last for years, as long as I don't lose it!  With a good dose of elbow grease, the stove has come up a treat and looks lovely now.  It might get lit this week if the temperatures keep dropping. With a small mid-week spend, our available budget for the month has plummeted to around £65.  We are already looking into the storecupboards and thinking about the meals we haven't had for a while - I know corned beef hash will be on the menu sometime very soon!"},
{"title": "Buy British Day", "date": "Saturday 4 October 2014", "text": "Yesterday, Friday, was \"Buy British Day\" - an initiative I hadn't heard of until I saw it on the BBC News.  Apparently it is a drive to encourage us to support British manufacturers and producers.  British brands really used to epitomise the essence of top quality and manufacturing across the old Empire and Commonwealth.  Unfortunately, we seem to have lost the plot and outsourced a lot of our industries in recent history, and this seems to be a plot to reclaim our glorious heritage. (image from makeitbritish.co.uk)We have some amazing products in this country, from very British food like pork pies and Stilton cheese, through to beautiful Harris tweed.  I'm all for minimising the distance that things travel from production to user, and buying British is one way of doing it.However, buying British isn't always economical.  And that is why we lost out in the past, I believe - other countries could produce the goods at a more competitive price and consumers led the way in driving down prices.So how do I square my conscience, buying British where I can, but also keeping account and not splashing the cash beyond the budget?  It's not easy.  One strategy is, of course, to buy second-hand.  Good quality British-made clothes are often found in the charity shops alongside the stuff produced abroad.   Another way is to support small local producers, at craft fairs, roadside stalls, and local shops for example.  Check the labels, and look for the Union Jack and the indication that the item is made in this country. And when I am buying food, I object to buying food brought here from the other side of the world when we produce perfectly good equivalents in this country and Ireland, which is closer to home.  I recently bought some Value grated cheese from that supermarket, and noticed that the cheese and milk were from \"the UK, Ireland and New Zealand\" - New Zealand?!?!  The other side of the world?  Yet the Co-op can produce an equivalent product for a couple more pennies, just using UK & Ireland milk and cheese.....I've been buying it from the Co-op ever since. It's a matter of doing what we can, within our budgets and not feeling bad if we can't.  It's an idea, that's all.  Small steps, within our means.  Harris tweed is amazing, but not within my reach!"},
{"title": "Therapies", "date": "Friday 3 October 2014", "text": "There's one in particular that I won't be taking part in this month, when we are Stoptobering.Therapies should surely make one feel better, or soothe a physical ache, or a mental pain.  For me, there is no better way than to get outside and enjoy some sunshine or fresh air. Being with my family, reading a good book, cosying up to the woodburner with a mug of tea and a film or my knitting on a weekend afternoon, the smell of furniture polish, or a mooch around the garden, looking at what's changing, talking to the cat or chatting to the chooks. A plate of warm rice pudding with a dollop of home made jam.  Yorkshire pudding.  Thick stew full of vegetables and the flavour of some beef, a roast chicken dinner with lashings of gravy.  A light Victoria sponge made so that I can indulge...The Christmas tree lights twinkling in the corner and the snow carpeting the ground outside.  A Sunday morning service in the chapel with friends, singing hymns loud and free.  A letter from a friend.  A jolly good book.All ways that I enjoy feeling happy, satisfied and content. If someone offered me the opportunity for a spot of retail therapy, I'd politely decline.  Each to their own, but mooching around a shopping centre or town for hours on the off chance that one might see the very thing is not my idea of fun.  It's a chore, something that very occasionally just has to be endured, but I need therapy to get over it!!  I've been to Cambridge and Peterborough this year with the girls, and whilst I enjoyed spending time with them, I just don't like the aimlessness of the wandering.......just want to look at that, perhaps there'll be a better one in there....end up back at the first shop an hour later...... Just as well, then, that we won't be spending too much time in the shops this month.  Thank goodness.And Christmas shopping?  If I can't buy it in one of the local shops for preference, or on t'internet, we don't need it. How are your plans for the month shaping up?  Are you Stoptobering too?"},
{"title": "Ahead of the weather", "date": "Thursday 2 October 2014", "text": "Here's a photo post to lighten the reading!  With all the rain we have forecast in the next few days, I thought I would spend a bit of time in the garden after I finished my phone shift this morning.The sun is shining and there's lots to do!Pots to wash and stash away.  Not today though. Here's Shadow who does literally follow me around the garden.  If I am busy, she will sit nearby and just watch - she's not bothered if she doesn't get too much attention, but the company seems to be what she's after.  She's gorgeous!Still picking tomatoes - these are Sweet Million.  Very sweet, and loads of them!  I have picked some to take to the chapel ladies this afternoon.And the chooks!!  They come running every time we go out, just in case we had a tidbit for them.  Well, they were lucky as there were a couple of crusts left from the YFG's breakfast, so that kept them occupied for all of about, ooh, two seconds?!We have lots of wood, ready for the winter fires.  This heap is close to the house, and the plastic sacks are just to keep the worst of the rain off.Above the woodpile there, I have knocked some nails into the rafters this afternoon and hung some bean plants up to dry.  I haven't done this before and just thought it might be a good idea.  The beans are Ferrari, and have done very well this year, so I hope that I could get some more to plant out next year if I let the pods dry out under here.And here's the new chair which I shall enjoy sitting in when all the work is done!Yes, I know it doesn't \"go\" with the enormous rug, but I'm not one to bother about that, particularly.  We'll probably take that rug up when we eventually sell the house, and until then, it is trying to keep the carpet underneath a little cleaner, as well as protecting it from sparks from the fire occasionally.Think of me here tonight, reading my book, perhaps.  It is very comfy!"},
{"title": "Keeping record", "date": "Wednesday 1 October 2014", "text": "The YFG has had the first spend of the month from our £100 - she has asked for a £1.99 book to download onto her tablet from the Amazon Kindle store.  I allowed it. The YFG has not always been a good reader,  in both senses of the word.  She read her first book when she was about 6, sitting on our bed here, at 10pm one night, quite spontaneously.  It was an Oxford Reading Tree Biff and Chip book, and it was a heck of a surprise that night - we had been reading to her for years, and encouraging her, but she had been reluctant, so we were delighted when she revealed how well she had been taking it all in!Even so, she was not that keen on reading, until she got her reading glasses when she was about 12, and all of a sudden, she took off!  The glasses just tipped the balance with a muscle in her eye, which had been a struggle for her to control - and she was rocking!  She reads every night, she takes a book with her in the car, and on journeys, and she loves to read - I am so pleased.And so I support and encourage her in that.  She reads all sorts of books, but unfortunately, she finds few of them in our local library, and I do indulge her choices as often as I can.  Our copies of the Harry Potter books and the Twilight books are extremely well thumbed, and she has read and reread all of them several times. Reading is a gift, and I am so sad that some children never really \"get\" it - it can open windows into new worlds, offer inspiration, comfort and be a very valuable way of spending family time together."},

In November, I shall have to think about Christmas!"},

In the evening, I was able to sit and watch Downton in peace.The EFG sent me a Moonpig mug with some photos of us all on it, and the YFG wrapped up a couple of things I had bought for myself - a copy of the latest Jack Reacher novel, Personal, and a new Bible. Some would say that the Jack Reacher novel was far from frugal, but hey!  If I can't reap the benefits of being frugal and have a wee splurge now and again, when can I?!  To me, it is a good buy because it will be read time and time again - I love to read and re-read because I always notice something different each time and find myself reading an ever so slightly different story, but that is just me.  Hardback books are an investment to me, and I usually buy Lee Child and Phillipa Gregory in hardback, because I know that I will get my money's worth!!My sister sent a parcel with UJ, and it was a lovely cloth bag and a diary.  The neighbour brought a scented candle which was a lovely thought, and I was appreciative.  I have managed to work the allotted three hours today and had a good selection of calls answered!  Just on the day when my voice would have appreciated people not answering their phones, it seemed as if every other person I called was in and chatty - never mind, it is good for business, I suppose.  The throat isn't too sore tonight, but I am off to have a bath and read some more Jack Reacher soon.There's a certain amount of repetition going on at the moment as we are clearing out the freezers a little!  As long as they are meals we like, we don't mind.....Today we are having cold chicken left over from the weekend's roast chook, served with some rice and veggies.Tuesday will be sausages, with mash and veg.  We do have a vast supply of sausages at present.  I can see them looming large every week for a while.Wednesday we'll have some fish: the YFG may well have fish in batter and I love river cobbler.Thursday night, after working after the piano lesson, the YFG can zap some lasagne and I will just have a snack.Friday night will be a Cottage pie that I am going to try to make earlier in the day so that we can just ding it when we get home from gymnastics. Saturday night the YFG is babysitting but I don't yet know what time, so it'll have to be something quick and easy......and Sunday?  Haven't quite got there yet!  A freezer rummage will be due before then.....Hope you all have a good week. I am going to attempt to work this morning for a while but if folk can't hear what I am saying, I may have to have a break and try again later.  I feel not too bad, but I have lost a lot of voice - not good for telephone work!"},

Then, yesterday morning, the YFG went out of the door to catch the bus, and came back 10 minutes later looking more like a drowned rat and slightly tearful, saying that she couldn't go to school all wet like this and had missed the bus now.  We scurried about and she found some dry clothes and shoes, and we went off to school in the car.  Halfway there, she said she was sorry that she'd put me to the bother.  I told her not to be daft, and that that was the point of me taking the job, so that I could be at home for her when she needed me - I just started work at 9.30am instead of 9am.  It was as if I was reminding Myself that that was the point, too!God spoke powerfully yesterday and showed me that this is a temporary job, perhaps just for a couple of years, but it is one that I can be good at eventually.  However, I need to learn to TAKE direction again, to be humble and to learn to follow someone else's rules - I have been used to leading and making the rules, answering to no one particularly in some areas of my life, and God has gently shown me that this is a learning curve in more ways than one."},

Yesterday I had to admit defeat and go to bed at 9.30pm which is quite early for me!  I had been on the phone for the requisite three hours, and hadn't had a bad day with the work on the first day - I made a few bookings, spoke to some people, got a lot of numbers not answered, and only had a couple of stroppy folk.......it was a relief to get to the end of the day, though.This morning we are up early as the YFG is going on a school trip and has to be in school at 8am to catch the bus.  They are off to some science labs to see some Physics \"stuff\" and she is quite interested in science so I hope she has a good day.That supermarket is in the headlines again today - half its market value wiped off the share price yesterday!  Quite a shock, really but this is the shape of things to come, I am afraid.I'm off now, but shall endeavour to pop back later and read your blogs.  Hope you have a good day x"},

Friday - I'm going to cook some sticky chicken drumsticks during the day and chill them, then serve them cold with a quick stir fry when we get home from gymnastics.Saturday - the YFG's favourite weekend supper - fish and chips and peas - all from the freezer.  I might get the river cobbler I didn't have last night.Sunday - my birthday so my favourite - roast chicken.  Means we'll have several chicken dinners ahead to use it all up."},

Apart from all of that, life continues apace, as usual!  This afternoon I have had a church ladies' group here for a couple of hours of chatting and hatching plans, which has been interesting and fun.  I have also done an online supermarket order from that place I am not that fond of, but when they send you an invitation to get £15 off when you spend £60, it seems churlish not to take advantage - the cat is now well stocked up for the next month or two, for example, and we have enough squash on order to float a small boat, but best to order stuff which has a long shelf life when you are planning ahead.The EFG rang the house phone and found it engaged whilst I was talking to my dad, so she had a chat with the YFG on her mobile whilst I was busy, then I had to pay for the shopping, and put the tea on for the YFG and her friend, so I have just tried to ring her back and she isn't answering at the moment.  Hopefully I can catch her later - my dad reported that she rang him last night and had a wee blether about life.  I gather from this end of the conversation with the YFG that there might have been some demonstrations in Aberdeen today or last night about the result of the referendum - she did share last night that English students had been advised to keep a low profile last night. I hope that the emotions which have no doubt been stirred up soon settle down."},

There is a FB group for the people who work for this company, as everyone works at home, so it is a way of interacting with others who do the same or similar roles. God does answer prayer - I always said I was looking for a job I would be able to start in September, and be part time.  If I could do the job at home, so much the better.  Strikes on all accounts - thank you, Father!  I have felt particularly watched-over and blessed these past couple of weeks.  God is good. Better go - need to review some documents this morning before the training."},

{"title": "A frugal break", "date": "Tuesday 16 September 2014", "text": "Thank you all for your comments and ideas to enable us to spend a couple of days in Aberdeen with the EFG at half term.  I still don't know whether it will actually come off, but I hope to sort it out for sure today.I have found that there is a Youth Hostel in Aberdeen, and there are family rooms that can be taken for a few days there.  At various prices, so we can pick and choose how we want to spend our cash.  I don't think that the YFG will be very keen on sleeping in a multi-person dormitory with people she doesn't know, so a room might be best for us.  We can also self-cater there, which is an important aspect for us.For the ride north, I think that we will be letting the train take the strain, as they say.  It takes a lot of worry away from me, and it will be good to go on the train a couple of times with the YFG so that when she is a wee bit older, she can make the journey to see her sister on her own.  With a Friends and Family railcard, the cost will be in the region of £120 or so, and it would easily cost me more than that for diesel if I was to attempt the drive!  Apart from that, I don't really fancy driving nearly 500 miles in a day, twice in one week...The last time we travelled on the train at the October half term, we made the mistake of doing the journeys on the Saturdays when we went to Burghead near Forres in Moray.  We loved the holiday, but the train journeys weren't great because the trains were so packed with other holiday makers.  Perhaps by travelling on the Monday and Thursday or Friday, we may be able to avoid the rush.There are other options, as my sister has offered to get a cottage for the half term so that we can see the EFG.  I don't know whether to stick to the original plans, or to go with her, or to let the YFG and UJ go with her.  There was a plan that the YFG and UJ would go up at half term with my cousin and her husband, but that plan fell through when the husband couldn't get the time off work.  I will be talking with my sister today to see what she thinks. The slight spanner in the works is that I was offered a job yesterday!  I won't have accrued any holiday allowance by the end of October, and apparently, all holiday for the year has to be booked by January 1st each year!  Missed that deadline, then. If we manage to go on the trip, I think that the days off will be allowed, as I did tell the interviewer yesterday that I had plans, but I will be taking them as unpaid leave.  To someone who has been self-employed for so long, that makes sense - if you don't work, you don't get paid.

{"title": "In the kitchen", "date": "Monday 15 September 2014", "text": "Bright and early on a busy Monday morning and there is a lasagne cooking away in the oven, ready for the YFG's supper tonight.  I've got a meeting to go to at the school this afternoon, and a church meeting tonight so I thought it would be good to get it made and ready for her to \"ping\" in the microwave later on.  There are four portions in the pan, so she will have another one later in the week, and some will be stashed away in the freezer for another week.  I shall be doing the same trick with a chicken casserole later this week.There were actually six portions when I dished it out.The menu for this week looks like this:Monday - Lasagne for the YFG and chicken liver & veg for me.Tuesday - Baked potato and beans/tuna/cheese/salad, etc combinationsWednesday - Chicken thigh & sweet potato casseroleThursday - RisottoFriday - Lasagne for the YFG and sausages for meSaturday - Fish and chips [from the freezer] for the YFG and river cobbler and veg for me....There are things I can't eat, which means I can't share all that the YFG wants to eat.  We have to adapt some of the meals to tweak them so that there is a version I can eat as well as the one she wants to enjoy.  All that I have bought specifically for this menu is the sweet potatoes, as we have got everything else in the store cupboards, freezer or vegetable rack. Whilst I have got the oven on, I am going to pop a tray of flapjack in, and then use up some spotty bananas by making some banana and walnut cake, so I'd better get on.  See you later!"},

I buy cat biscuits at Lidl's at 99p/kg so I don't begrudge a hedgehog a feed - the cat isn't ours anyway, so I might as well just put the biscuits out for whoever needs a midnight feast. It's good to have hedgehogs in the garden to keep the slug population under control, although this one might not bother with too many slugs if I let it feast on the cat food!  Balance is required, I think......Hope you have a good Sunday.  I am off to chapel this morning, and then my dad is coming over this afternoon.  I also have a heap of ironing to keep me occupied at some point today - school shirts!  The weather looks set fair for one more day at least, so I hope to be able to spend some time in the garden, getting it ready for autumn and winter."},
{"title": "EFG update", "date": "Saturday 13 September 2014", "text": "We have been chatting with the EFG nearly every day on Google Hangout which is a really useful app to have - it saves using up our minutes on our phones, and means that we can see each other too.  I have to admit that some of the time, she looks a bit miserable - sometimes tired, sometimes bored!  She is having a long week this week, with nothing too structured to do and lots of leisure time - the cinema is offering students free showings of films and there is a free bus to get home afterwards, but the film didn't start until 10.30pm last night, so she is rather worn out this morning.  It is lovely when we get a glimmer of a smile, though......hoping for more of those as she gets more involved.I just keep telling myself that she has got to go through this process of becoming more self-sufficient, although it is rather painful for me to watch.  Once the lectures and labs begin next week, I know that she will thrive on it all, and be more engaged.  She hasn't said that she wants to come home yet, anyway!"},
{"title": "Getting that letter", "date": "Friday 12 September 2014", "text": "As I blogged last month, I thought that I should be entitled to Widowed Parent's Allowance but it seemed to be taking for ever to come through.  I knew that the FH had paid the requisite amount of NI, or so I believed anyway, and couldn't see what the delay was.I phoned up again last week, and at last someone could explain: there can't be an account open connected to my NI number for WPA whilst there is an account open on the FH's NI number for Old Age Pension, as our NI numbers are connected to one another because we were married......so the OAP account had got to be closed down before the WPA account could be opened. These things take time........I was trying very hard to be patient, but I really wanted to KNOW!And, at last, on Monday, a brown envelope turned up, to tell me that yes, I am entitled to WPA whilst the YFG is here and I get Child Benefit for her.  WPA is not a fortune, but it makes a heck of a difference in our circumstances.  It gives me three years of leeway in being able to be here for the YFG when she gets home from school, of not having to take just any job that I can find.  It means that I can be very careful with cash and probably only work part time, so that I don't have to leave her to go and work very odd shifts in Tesco - I have looked on the jobsearch websites and some Tesco [and other supermarkets, for that matter] jobs ARE rather odd shift patterns! We won't be able to afford foreign holidays, we won't eat out and we won't be wearing the latest fashions.  We'll be careful with our money, as usual, and we'll get by.  We will probably be able to stay in this house for a while longer, which gives me more time to get the FH's workshop sorted out and the house smartened up for viewings. I have applied for a couple of jobs this week.  I shall keep looking :)"},

{"title": "Embarassed at the till", "date": "Tuesday 9 September 2014", "text": "How do you think you would feel at the till if the cashier passed comment on the amount you had spent? The YFG and I were in Lidl's on Sunday afternoon, standing at the till, a couple of people behind a lady and her husband who were putting their shopping through and packing it as the cashier checked it off.  They did have a trolley full of goods, and I was idly wondering how much it would come to, but even I was a bit shocked when the cashier asked her for just over £170.  I couldn't see all their shopping, and I would guess that for a trolley of shopping to have reached that value in Lidl, they probably bought quite a bit of meat, perhaps.However, I wasn't prepared for the cashier to pass a comment on the shopping - along the lines of that was the most he had ever put through a till, and what a lot they had spent.....I don't think any hole would have been big enough to swallow me if someone had said that to me! The lady was very dignified, and replied, \"Oh, this is just a standard....\" and I thought she was going to say \"monthly\" but she said \"weekly shop for us\" and then I was a little surprised.  She went on to explain that this was for her and her husband and three children.My thoughts on the cashier's comments are that he had no right to discuss that family's purchases like that, and to embarrass the lady, making her feel that she had to justify her shopping.  Yes, she had bought a lot of food, but if he hadn't drawn attention to it, the rest of the queue wouldn't have thought much about it, and I certainly would just have thought that she was doing a big monthly shop.  If families can afford to spend that much each week, good luck to them - I will stick to my budget and think about what to say to a cheeky cashier!"},

To make that from scratch would involve, I would think, eggs, flour, butter, sugar, lemons, perhaps milk.......and it would probably be cheaper than buying boxes of who knows what.  And I already have a good recipe for a lemon tray bake, so I am no further forward in expanding my repertoire!"},

That wee blue one on the top is one that I made for her as a pram quilt when she was a baby - and she has taken it with her for a tiny touch of home - I was touched to see that in the packing bags!And my sister took her to Lidl's before she left, so she has a wee stash of food to be going on with!Unfortunately, there is only a small fridge freezer to be shared between 5 people, and the rooms were previously for catered students, not self-catering, so there was not such a demand on the space.  Requests have been put in for a larger one, or an additional one, so they might end up with more room; the EFG is feeling like she needs to eat some of her fridge food quickly because she is taking up more than her share of the fridge space since they went shopping before they knew the size of the fridge!I'm relieved that I have pictures of the room she is living in, and I have spoken with her at length.  She IS a wee bit lonely at the moment, but she hasn't had time to find many friends yet, only acquaintances, and I know from experience that once \"normal\" life starts on the 15th with lectures, labs, seminars etc, she will find it much better - this week always felt a bit weird to me, and I prefer the structure of the work!Thanks for all your kind words and support!  We know we are not the only ones with a student just leaving home, and we are reassured that we will all be fine in the long run!  Hope you have a good Sunday - we have a baptism at chapel this morning so I am looking forward to that."},

I'm going up there in a minute to see what she is up to!Now I have the full story and some pictures to share - they seem to have trekked all over London!  These are the EFG's pictures, but I know that the YFG has some more which I haven't got my hands on just yet - so maybe there'll be a few extra ones another day.This is one of the guards at the stables end of Buckingham Palace, apparently.  There's been a lot in the news lately about the guard entertaining the crowds at the front facade by doing various unapproved moves instead of his proper behaviour - an ex-army relative here today was very disapproving and reckoned the chap's behaviour would have cost him his job in his day, but we may hear in the news what is going to happen to this chap once it has been investigated.The rear view of the palace, after the tour, and one is allowed to stroll in the gardens.  They enjoyed the tour and the YFG bought me a guidebook so I could \"see\" it all too - very kind of her.  The EFG thought of my shopping bag tendencies and brought me a \"Buckingham Palace\" jute shopping bag.  I shall look just the thing in Aldi and Lidl with that - I shouldn't think Her Majesty pops in there too often, although with her Germanic heritage, she should probably have a look!The memorial out the front - quite splendid but not a great photo.Lunch was taken as \"afternoon tea\" at Brown's Hotel - very posh indeed and quite a surprise for my two country bumpkins, but they behaved impeccably and thought it very nice - although they said that they couldn't manage it all!  Apparently there were sandwiches and pastries to begin, scones with jam and cream and then blueberry tarts [below] or Victoria Sponge - and they stalled at the cake course!  A very generous piece of Brown's Blueberry cake.  Love the white linens.......rather risky with blueberries, perhaps - they must have a good laundry service!They also went to the Tower of London to see the Sea of Poppies for Remembrance of the First World War, they popped in to Covent Garden to see the shops and the market; Harrod and Fortnum & Mason were also investigated, and numerous tube journeys made.The evening at the performance of War Horse was magnificent, they say, and they had a wonderful day.  My sister splashed out and really spoiled them, and they are very appreciative.Today, the EFG is off.  I have about another 90 minutes with her before I leave her with my sister for their journey north.  I guess that the last 18 years has been the time I was given to make my mark on her, to bring her up the best we could, and now is the time to let her go, and to trust that we did our best to show her the right way to follow, and she must learn to march forth in her own style now...John Rosemond says that we have brought up our children successfully if we are able to help them out of our lives and into fully independent lives of their own.She'll be home at Christmas.  I shall make plans to spoil her just a little!"},

{"title": "Norwich today", "date": "Tuesday 2 September 2014", "text": "We went to Norwich in the car, and left it in the Park & Ride, travelling into town on a new bendy bus!  The driver said it was his first day on the P&R but we really hoped it wasn't his first day driving a bendy bus.  The trip took about 20 minutes, and had a wee tour of the UEA campus as well on the way, which inspired the YFG afresh with her midwifery plans.The inner castle keep - the balcony above is the original level of the main floor, and this floor is apparently a later Victorian addition.This was our first view of the castle this lunchtime.  The sun was shining beautifully, and it was warm.  When we came out at half three, it was much fresher and the clouds had come over.  The castle is beautiful on the hill, and it looks quite imposing - it's been there over 900 years after all.There were extensive natural history exhibits, and they were really good for showing us the local wildlife - although I am not sure how local this enormous white pelican was.  In another room were some lions that had been shot in Kenya in 1908 - they were in surprisingly good condition being over 100 years old!We sat in the Rotunda and enjoyed a cup of tea, sitting right next to this e-n-o-r-m-o-u-s teapot!  This is believed to be the largest teapot in the world, and it is in Norwich.......there is rather a collection of teapots in the castle - over 3000 of them!There is a very interesting - and locally relevant - section about the Iceni and Boudicca.  This picture shows how the Iceni used to worship - at water sources and rivers, and often by placing valuable items into the water: this chap seems to be putting a knife into some marshy, reedy ground.We paid a little extra to go on a tour of the dungeons - what an experience that was!  Down a  long flight of steps, and into some very damp-smelling and dank rooms far underground, a guide showed us the cells and vaults with some gruesome exhibits.  There were some plaster casts of heads there, and they were made after the executions of murderers who were put to death at the castle or in the nearby market square.  There was also a gibbet - a metal cage in which the murderers were put in later years as a method of execution BUT the bodies had to be left in the cage until it disappeared: the bodies were denied a proper burial.   In the deepest of the dungeons we heard a story about a monk, cousin to Henry III's wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, who killed his prior and was held there in the 1200s......if I have remembered it right!There is an exhibition in the upper level of the Rotunda connected to the Royal Anglian regiment - it was heartbreaking to read the soldiers' letters home to their families and to read about those who didn't make it back.  There were pictures and memorabilia from the First World war in particular, and it was all brilliantly arranged.We really enjoyed the day out, and would go back again for anther good look around - there was so much to see and do.  The exhibits in the keep were very interactive and there were lots of activities for children to do, so it would be great for all ages."},

We have heard yesterday that the EFG's accommodation issues are COMPLETELY resolved and she will be able to move directly into her permanent room on Saturday - hooray!!  No moving and mucking about on the 12th, worrying about being in two places at once as she had an induction booked for the same time as the moving van, and making new mates on the corridor twice! Tomorrow the girls are off to London with my sister for a day sightseeing, and then the evening performance of War Horse, as I have already said [sorry - we are all quite excited about their day!] but it means that they are going to have a Very Long Day in the capital.  Hence we have scaled back our Norfolk plans and did not go to Norwich yesterday.  We're off today, we hope - and Blickling will have to wait until Easter, I think.We're going to the Park and Ride, then we'll catch a bus into the city, where we are going to the Castle Museum.  W're doing this on a budget - by going in on the P&R, we get the museum tickets for just £3.80 each, rather than the full price.  Bargain.  We did think about going on the train, but with the tickets for that costing over £30 for the three of us, and losing out on the P&R discount, we thought that we were probably better off driving as it isn't really that far.  Hopefully we will have some decent weather today and can post some photos for you later.....I plan to call in at an Aldi on the way home - the fridge is beginning to look a little bare, and that voucher is burning a hole in my purse!

I have given the EFG a couple of \"student\" cookbooks to take on her journey, but it did occur to me that they might be very useful for the YFG and I too.  I will be cooking for two now, instead of four, and it feels strange already.  I have been preparing for it through the summer: whenever I bought meat, I packaged in one or two-person portions before I froze it, and the apple sauce has been bottled in smaller jars this year.The YFG does love a bit of junk now and again [pizza and chips with her friend last night, for example] but she will eat most things [apart from courgettes and mushrooms, she would shout] so I am not thinking that there will be any major dramas.  I just have to think about things more carefully - freezing bread for her in smaller packages than whole loaves, for example, because a whole loaf would go off before she could manage to eat it.  We may not have roast dinners with joints of meat unless we have guests, perhaps, or we could cook a joint and freeze extra portions....we're going to have to have a go at this one and see what feels right. I'm going to join in with Sue's storecupboard challenge once everyone is back in a routine - there are still some things to buy for the journey for the EFG and the YFG needs to think about what she is going to eat in her lunchbox this term - she may not fancy her last staple of cheese and tomato sandwiches this term.  We have a new budget to manage, and it will be interesting to see if we can go even lower!Your comments and advice would be welcomed........"},

{"title": "Vacuum cleaner laws", "date": "Saturday 30 August 2014", "text": "Goodness me, the emotions that can be raised by a new law about the manufacture and import of the humble vacuum cleaner!  They have come on somewhat since their early days......(image from en.wikipedia.org)I remember my Mum having an upright one for years which she often had trouble with, something to do with the belt slipping off the motor....and my granny always had one with a long hose attachment.  Mum went to work at Gonville & Caius college in Cambridge when I was older, and we met the first of a series of Henry hoovers that she used working in the accommodation houses there.  She loved her Henry so much that she eventually had one at home too.  (image from amazon.co.uk)We have had a blue upright Vax vacuum for several years, probably at least 5 years.  It has been replaced once, by a hose type like Henry, which then died and we had to go back to the Vax.  The Vax only does any good if it is emptied every time it is used, and I mean Every Time!And so the time came yesterday.......in light of the new legislation, a rather nice vacuum cleaner was half price in that supermarket, and so I bought one.  It actually picks things up without having to go over the carpet half a dozen times - what bliss to be able to clean a room in 5 minutes instead of 15!"},
{"title": "Cooking by gas", "date": "Friday 29 August 2014", "text": "Round here, that phrase, \"cooking by gas\" means that we are getting on with things, busy!Actually, what I mean by it now is that we are actually able to use the gas hob again - the plumber friend of the FH's came round this morning, found the leak and repaired it, and we've tried it out for lunch and supper.  The chap is also going to order a new bath panel for me, to replace the one I broke years ago, putting my knee through it whilst leaning over the bath, washing the girls' hair over the bath.I popped along to the knitting club after he left, to show the ladies how the Alpinia is progressing, and to help with the tea and coffees, and then the hoovering afterwards.I confess that I had a bit of a rest after lunch whilst the girls went off for a bike ride, but then I folded up all the washing I had hung out in the bracing breeze this morning and got dry, and I cut the front lawn.  Whilst I was washing up the supper dishes tonight, I made some flapjack to feed my recent addiction - got to stop that!!  The girls have helped me and at least half of it is gone now - less to worry about rationing tomorrow, surely!?!I'm off to have a shower now and think about tomorrow.  Lots to be thankful for tonight including having both my girls here with me.  We are off to Norfolk on Monday and Tuesday, they are going to London on Wednesday and the YFG is back to school Thursday.........time is going to F-L-Y!Yesterday was not the most marvellous of days, since we didn't really do very much of note! We did, however, manage to successfully fetch a new fluorescent tube for the kitchen light from the local DIY shop, which hasn't worked for more than a fortnight.  The YFG and I got it working when we got home, and hey presto, we had light!  Whilst we were in town, I took the old kitchen sink to the town recycling centre, making it within a minute of their closing time - we were very lucky.  The YFG had wanted to take an old chest of drawers from her room as well, but we couldn't fit it into the car, and I am not sure that I want to throw it out yet either - I have seen some lovely revamping techniques on Elaine's and Froog's blogs, so it may be that we have a go at some of them to revitalise the furniture.I have also spent a little time on the internet, and rekindled my interest in YouGov - with all the stuff we have had going on here lately, I haven't had time to do any of their polls so there isn't a lot in the kitty there - only about £7, so I shall have to be a little more consistent in trying to do them, towards earning the next £50 payout.All my lovely jars of apples have been safely stored away in the cupboards, on the shelf next to the marmalade which I had made for the FH shortly before he died: he liked that when he was having toast for breakfast, but since he had been having stewed fruit most mornings, I still have quite a stash of marmalade to get through.  Perhaps I shall have to bless others with some of that?!Avoiding spending is still high on my schedule although some companies seem intent on parting me from my cash - the House of Bath sent a catalogue yesterday morning.......we are not your typical HoB customers, I believe, from the range of items within their pages, but we have bought a couple of mobility things from their website in the past for the FH, which is how they have all our details.  It would be best if they forgot our details now, as I am not about to be swayed by pages and pages of bedding, kitchen items and clothing. Today is Friday, as you know, and this time next week, the YFG and I will be waving Cheerio to the EFG as she and my sister start to make their way northwards.  Thanks to SusanM in the comments yesterday for sharing that the Daily Record was running a story about the accommodation debacle at Aberdeen; we are just so grateful that the EFG has a room for the week until the 12th and then she will have a permanent place for the rest of the year.  The article is slightly worrying about the cost of accommodation in the years ahead, when she has to go out and live in a flat - it sounds expensive!  Hopefully, the EFG will remember some of our frugal ways and be able to manage.[I have managed to weave 9 words into that post which are apparently disappearing from common English usage......any guesses as to which ones they are?]"},

After that, I dropped the EFG off at her friend's house for the night so that they can go off shopping in the morning, and then came home with the YFG for what remained of the evening - it was past 8 when we left the EFG.Today is going to be an at-home day until we have to pick the EFG up later on.  Time is ticking onward relentlessly, and she has managed to get together most of the bits and pieces that she needs.  The days are mostly getting allocated to things now, and there are just a couple of days left when we have nothing to do.  The latest insertion to the calendar is that my sister is taking the girls to London next week to see War Horse on Wednesday.  The YFG will go back to school on Thursday and the EFG will be off to Scotland on Friday.  Then we will be looking forward to that midwinter time of rejoicing, the name of which I cannot quite bring myself to mention just yet!(image from theguardian.com)"},

Tomorrow [today!] we have a busy day scheduled with a school meeting, a trip to the cinema with our Clubcard vouchers, a visit to UJ's house to water his garden and greenhouse whilst he is away and then dropping the EFG off to stay the night with a friend so that they can go to Cambridge shopping the next day.

When we came home, I was able to enjoy my lunch sitting under the verandah in the FH's favourite old perch, and then I read a book there [The Best Yes, by Lysa TerKeust], and eventually even had a wee nap - well, that's what Sunday afternoons are for, aren't they?  Unfortunately, when I woke up, I was summoned to climb the mountain that is Student Finance with the EFG - trying to help her work out budgets and income/outgoings - sort of like her cash flow.  Bit challenging, if I am honest - she seems to think it is going to be a struggle to manage on £25 a week for food, even though I think that is generous.  She's got to learn to be economical......but she may have to learn the hard way.Last night, we watched a silly, girly film, and I did some knitting - perfect.  The girls were giggling over Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde!  Then they watched Bizarre ER, which was a step too far for me, so I went off to tackle the washing up....."},

And then there is the new funding for our situation.  I think I am entitled to a Widowed Parent's Allowance whilst I am getting Child Benefit for the YFG.....but it hasn't turned up yet.  I phoned them on Friday to see what was happening, and was told that it had been turned into a \"manual claim\" and would have to be processed by hand somewhere, and so would be delayed somewhat. \"But don't worry,\" the kindly sounding woman said, \"you'll get it backdated to the bereavement date.\"  I'm lucky that I am in the fortunate position of being able to manage until it does turn up, but I do feel for those for whom this lifeline is essential and they need it now.  A lump sum in six weeks' time won't feed the children now, after all.  I can see how easily people fall into debt when they have no cushion of savings to fall back on in these situations.I have received a Bereavement Payment, which has paid a good chunk of the funeral expenses.  We had prepared, as you know, for funeral expenses and for an emergency fund.  The \"average\" funeral costs are supposed to be in the range of £4000 at the moment, so we were fortunate to come in well under that amount.  I'm going to do a post about funerals in the future, as I feel that they are an area where we need to plan in advance, as we are so upset and distracted at the time that more money is sometimes spent than we realise.I hope that our situation will be sorted out by the end of September and we can start to get to grips with our new regime, and I can sort out some work for myself one way or another.  If I can't get a suitable job, I shall just have to ramp up my self-employment activities somehow......."},

The potato scone recipe was one I picked up from Gressenhall this week - they were selling recipe cards for 30p in aid of the Shire Horse fund - I am very fond of Shire Horses, so I thought I would choose a recipe in their support and this one looked very simple and quite frugal.  I made it twice and froze most of the scones, leaving just four in the tin for the YFG to nibble on - after all, there's \"nothing to eat\" if there is nothing instantly ready to eat........teenagers and bottomless pits!I have invited my dad over for lunch on Monday, with his partner, because I am not sure when else he will see the EFG before she toddles off to Aberdeen - time is running out!!  We are getting booked up rapidly.  My sister had promised to take the girls to London to see a show for their birthdays in 2012 and hadn't got around to it yet - she asked me this morning when they are free and I could give her only three days on which they are available before school and uni start - I shall be glad of a rest when September comes round!"},

{"title": "Adult in the house", "date": "Thursday 21 August 2014", "text": "The EFG has had her 18th birthday today - there's another adult here now, for a couple of weeks, anyway!We have had a busy day - popping off to school to pick up the YFG's GCSE Eng Lit result [B - rather fab!] and then visiting a couple of friends in the town to pick up cards!  We came home so that the EFG could have her hair trimmed and then she and I went to the other town whilst the YFG went swimming with her friend for an hour.  We came home and collapsed - they watched a film and I read a book, and then I nipped up to the chapel to have a chat with the Jigsaw club ladies for a bit of help with my current project.  When I came home, the local electrician was here to take away the poo pit pump for repair, and then it was time to cook enchiladas for the birthday tea.  The girls' brother, FHS, brought his partner over and they stayed until 10pm, chatting over chocolate birthday cake and raspberries for some time.  A good evening all round.All in all - a very productive day, with lots done, happy times shared, and another birthday celebration over. This morning I was remembering the day I gave her birth, and now it feels like her freedom is being dragged out of me, as I am reluctant to let her go so soon after the FH has gone from here.  I know that she must go, she has to be allowed to grow, to learn and to develop further, but that doesn't make it any easier......."},
{"title": "Photo post - Gressenhall", "date": "Wednesday 20 August 2014", "text": "The old workhouse, originally built as a House of Industry, is in a lovely red brick, and is quite simply enormous!  The locals called it the Paupers' Palace when it was built and you can see why!  This photo just shows one wing.The Poor Law Amendment act of 1834 transformed the House of Industry into a Workhouse, and it meant a great deal of change - segregation and a lot of walls being built to keep the different parties separate.  Families saw one another only for an hour on a Sunday afternoon.  This yard now houses a collection of tractors and wagons from Norfolk, but it was the yard in which women did laundry in the early days.This is the men's workyard looking one way.And this is the yard looking the other way.  A closed-in yard, with walls on all sides.Men etched their names onto the brick wall on one side of the work yard.  Names have been matched to records so that it is possible to date the names.  The FH's grandfather was born in a Norfolk workhouse, and it was interesting to find an alternative spelling of our name on a list of entrants to this particular workhouse, although it was not this one at which old William was born.In the infirmary ward, we found these strange triangular beds.  We wondered why they were triangular and then we read that this was simply in order to fit more beds in to the room!  We haven't worked out why they sloped from the head to the foot, though - it doesn't look very comfortable.This is the cafeteria yard now but it was the yard belonging to the \"Itch Ward\" - what a name!  This separate building was used as a Fever ward at one time, and at another period, was the entrance ward, where new paupers were deloused, washed and re-clothed.  The steam laundry was one of the most up-to-date in Norfolk at its time and was in use until the early 1970s, I think.  That little machine on the far left was used exclusively to wash the Matron's clothing - that didn't get mixed in with the rest!These blue doors hid racks which slid out on rails and sheets and items could be hung to air on them.  The words on the right were printed on to a sheet and say \"If you listen carefully, you can still hear the echoes and voices of women who worked here\" - we tried hard, but we couldn't.The board of governors of the workhouse was a very important group of people, so they had a big room to have their meetings in - very imposing and grand in comparison to many other areas of the workhouse.The internal workings of the workhouse clock.  For people who had lived their lives by the sun, rising and going to bed in tune with the seasons, having to live according to a timetable dictated by a clock was a huge shock to the system for them.There was a ward for six elderly couples called Cherry Tree Cottage, and this is the kitchen range.  This is the parlour of Cherry Tree Cottage. The wooden chairs are lovely and UJ still has some of those at his house - they are surprisingly comfortable and I could imagine toasting my toes by this fire.  Rag rugs were everywhere at Gressenhall.There was a row of shops, in some outbuildings, and this was a recreation of a local post office.The grocery shop with all the old packets on the shelves.And the garden supply shop - with boxes of seeds, including Painted Lady Runner beans which we still grow today.  I thought of FrugalInSuffolk, and her smallholding at this point, when I was looking around this part of the display.  There were some gorgeous little seed packets for flowers as well.A huge display of gardening and carpentry implements and tools mounted on the wall.One of a display of several different rugs - my grandmother had three of these in a very similar style in her kitchen when I was a child, and they were made of old wool items - incredibly durable.We went for a lovely walk along the River Whitewater - the water takes 10 days to flow from here down to the sea at Great Yarmouth.  It was picturesque and peaceful along here.  We went on a tractor and trailer ride around the farm, which was busy, and horse and cart rides were also on offer, with a beautiful pair of Suffolk Punches pulling a cart, but the queue for that was far too long, so we went for the walk instead.The chapel was built in 1868 with money raised by public subscription - it was originally just used by Church of England clergy, but the non-conformists also held services there as well eventually.Walking down the central aisle from the back towards the altar, it is quite unnerving in that the floor slopes downwards and one feels it quite sharply.  The decorated brickwork is attractive, and it was a lovely building.We found this plaque in the original main building and it seems to embody the ethos of the first House of Industry on the site.The smell of oil!  This is one of Norfolk's oldest horseless carriages, the Panhard et Lavassor car, dating from 1899 and once owned by Charles Rolls [he of Rolls Royce fame].  It was donated to the Norfolk Museums Service in 1936.  It has successfully completed the London to Brighton rally twice in the Nineties and is still taken out to shows occasionally.Gressenhall was incredibly good value for us - I paid just £20 for four children and I to have a great day there, with lots to look at, to do and to find out.  All the kids said they would go back there again, and it was very interesting.  I did splurge and buy them an ice cream, but that was about it!  We took packed lunches which we ate on the grass in the car park, and it was a fine day, so that was no problem.  Highly recommended!"},
{"title": "Housing update", "date": "Tuesday 19 August 2014", "text": "The phone call may or may not have had an impact this morning, but we did speak politely and firmly to a lady in the accommodation office, and by this evening, the EFG had an email saying that she can have a room on 12th September and if she wants to arrive before then, they will put her in temporary accommodation.  Phew!  The relief is amazing.  OK, there is a minor hiccup in that she will have to move from the temporary place to the permanent room, but that is minor compared with not having a room........we'll just have to pay for a taxi to move her if there is no help on that front from the uni.Today we have been to Gressenhall Workhouse and Museum of Rural Life - and it was fantastic!  I have taken loads of pictures, but I am tired now and I'll share them tomorrow: I am just SO relieved about the EFG!!"},
{"title": "Home needed", "date": "Monday 18 August 2014", "text": "(image from abdn.ac.uk)The university seems to have miscalculated slightly and has not got enough accommodation with which to honour its guarantee that it will house all first year students in halls.Not good.We're 480 or so miles away, so we can't exactly pop along and look at a few flats, and the EFG hasn't conveniently got a group of 3 or 4 friends to take along to share with, so we are in a bit of a pickle here tonight.We don't know for sure tonight that she hasn't got a place, but we haven't heard that she has, and on her FB group, those that have got accommodation know what they have, and those who have heard anything today have heard that they haven't.  She hasn't heard anything, so at this time, it seems prudent to presume the worst.We've got the phone number to ring at 9am prepared with a list of questions.  I am also going to politely but firmly tell someone that a recently bereaved student needs a little more support than she might get in a rented flat with a group of people she doesn't know.  I've emailed the Methodist minister there as well in case any families in the church want to offer lodgings, and we have scoured the rental websites - but you need a group of mates in order to rent a flat.....Stressful?  Yes.  The end of the world?  No.  Hassle we didn't need?  Definitely.  Disappointed with the uni?  Unfortunately, yes."},
{"title": "Friends and family", "date": "Sunday 17 August 2014", "text": "We've had a good day.  Didn't get to chapel this morning because I overslept [whoops!] but was glad in a way because a lovely lady from the village came up to see us with a bunch of flowers for us, and I would have missed her otherwise.  She chatted for a few minutes and we shared our news about the EFG and uni, and then she left.This evening, we have been to my sister's house for a BBQ with UJ too, and had a very nice evening, eating good food and playing with the latest additions to her feline family - two lovely kittens - which bring her cat count to nine!  There isn't a lot terribly frugal about Dear Sis, but she earns the money so I guess it is up to her how she spends it.  We've come home to a message on the answerphone from my dad, so I rang him back and he has done something really frugal - and a bit strange!  He told me I could have a sofa, which has been in the family for as long as I have, but it hasn't been used much and is in very good condition.  He has a towbar on his car, but no trailer, so when he saw a car towing a trailer in his town today, he followed it!!  He followed this poor random man home and asked him if he could possibly borrow his trailer!  And the man agreed....so he is going to bring me the sofa this week.Tomorrow, I am having an at-home day, as I have arranged a day out on Tuesday, so I need to get some things done here first.....starting with the washing and ironing.  Monday's chores, after all!"},
{"title": "Bargain hunting", "date": "Saturday 16 August 2014", "text": "The list of items which the EFG needs to take to Aberdeen is quite long, so we made a start on it today.  A particular charity shop had been recommended as THE local place to get household goods, but they seem to have suffered a lack of household donations lately - they had no cutlery or glasses at all today - but lots and lots of Shoes.  Sadly, we didn't need shoes. We mooched around the town for a wee while and had a good look in some of the other shops, before I took the girls to Morrison's for a treat lunch for them.  The EFG wryly commented that some of her friends have had meals out and champagne for their celebrations and she got to go to Morrison's for fish and chips, but when you go out as often as we do [not], then Morrison's best is a treat!  Even better, I met another local preacher in there and we had a lovely catch up - his wife played the organ for me for the FH's funeral and it was the first time we had seen them since, so they were eager to know how we're doing and how the EFG's results had turned out.This afternoon we headed further north into Lincolnshire and visited first my aunt and uncle, and then my cousin and her husband.  We had a good chat at both houses, and then travelled home via Morrison's again to make use of a couple of vouchers to get £10 of meat for £5 - I had already acquired one and then my aunt gave me another one!  It was a busy day in the meat department there, probably caused by the vouchers, so we ended up not having a lot of choice, but I brought home 4 x 500g minced beef, two lots of stewing steak and a large brisket joint, all for £10.  Rather a lot of beef, but it will last us for ages!Tonight, I have just had a snack tea and the girls have made themselves something, and we are all watching tv, knitting and occupying ourselves in the same room with one eye on Twilight: New Moon.  These last nights are for spending together, pootling around and generally just being.  The EFG bought a lovely multi-photo frame this afternoon and has spent the last hour sorting out photos of the four of us, printing them and cutting them to size.  She just needs one of her brother and it will be finished.......Hope you are all having a good weekend with those you love xx"},

The first birthday without the FH, and we are getting there - there are going to be a lot of \"firsts\" and it's the Christmas one that I am most worried about, I have to say.  But he was not that excited by Christmas himself, and hadn't got a lot of interest in it, so perhaps it won't be so bad.  I have had a lovely letter from another beekeeper's widow this week - her husband died just a week or so before the FH and we both imagine them together, talking bees wherever they are. The EFG has a bad back this afternoon so my sister has been recruited to take her to the doctor whilst I am on the cinema run - it was most unusual to be able to get an afternoon appointment at our surgery where the girls and I go, so I had to say thank you quickly and then work out how I would get her there and keep the YFG happy at the same time!  Luckily my sister lives close to the doctor's and is working from home today so she will help out.  We've started on the paracetamol and I can get the heat lamp out if necessary later.Hope you are all having a good Wednesday xx"},
{"title": "Monday memories", "date": "Monday 11 August 2014", "text": "Another funeral today - you don't go to one for years and then two in a month.This one was for a very old lady - she was 98, and died the day before the FH's funeral.  She had no family left, and the solicitors organised the arrangements, but she came to the chapel for the final goodbye.  She had been married for over 50 years before her husband died in 2001, and they had met when they were both Sunday school teachers at the chapel.  He was a lay preacher until 1978, and she was a church worker and the chapel organist as well.  The chapel here was the centre of their lives, and they were enough for one another in that they very much kept themselves to themselves, and did not have any children.It brought a tear or two for me, not so much for the lovely old lady, but for the joy of what they had had for one another.  Over fifty years together, and being the centre of one another's worlds all that time - what a wonderful relationship!  She had lived a good long life, and had been happy for much of it, including the last two years of her life when she was cared for in a local old people's home - she was obviously very well thought of there as five members of their staff came along to the funeral to pay their respects.  The ladies all spoke very fondly of her when we served tea and biscuits after the service.This lunchtime, UJ appeared with some greengages for me to make into jam tomorrow, and I gave him some beans on toast for a quick lunch before I asked him to help me [well, to allow me to assist him would be a more accurate description] to repair a chicken run gate which was falling apart.  We got the tools together and sorted that out, and then the YFG and I nipped into town to Lidl's and to the bank before my dad and MB arrived at 4.30pm for a cup of tea and a chat.  Dad brought along a lovely photograph that he had taken on the cruise of the girls, taken one evening before dinner, when they were in their glad rags, and looked rather glamorous!This evening we have been watching some tv and I have been doing some knitting......we are now counting down sleeps-to-go until the A level results - I am getting a bit nervous!"},
{"title": "Budget busting", "date": "Sunday 10 August 2014", "text": "Since the FH died, our income has changed quite drastically, and we have to sort out new streams of income - which are still in the process.  As a result, I know that I have to modify our budget to work alongside our new level of income.  Since there will only be the YFG and I here after the end of this month, I am really setting up a new budget just for the two of us, so it is quite a change.  The EFG will be almost financially independent with her student finance package, and I won't need to budget for her needs most of the year.  When I know about the amounts we will have available to us, we will be able to fine tune the budget, but this month I thought that I had better make a start.  I have kept all the receipts as I usually do, even though I had been lax about organising and recording the spending in specific categories on my charts.  I spent some time this afternoon sorting them out, and was a little alarmed at the size of the heap, but relieved to find that whilst the number of receipts seemed a lot, the actual spending wasn't that big - our food spend was well within the old budget, and only about £30 over the new one that I set today.Some of the costs of living here don't change however many of us there are, whereas other things should be quite different.  We have lost some of the perks of old age that the FH used to be entitled to, like the free television license, and the Winter Fuel Payment.  We will need to buy a tv license in October, so we have a couple of month's grace on that.  It isn't likely that I will reduce my diesel fuel costs much, for example, because the FH didn't use a lot of fuel, apart from when he was in hospital and our daily visits did bump it up - but he was worth it!  Neither did he cost much in clothing as he pottered around the house and garden in his comfy old clothes and rarely wanted anything new, so we used to buy him new clothes for his birthday and Christmas.  We obviously won't have the costs associated with the FH's little Fiesta any longer but one of my jobs for this month is to find it a new home!Our food budget has been lowered, I have cancelled a magazine subscription and suspended, with great regret, my Compassion child's support for six months whilst we see how this new system works and indeed, whilst I look for a job.  I really hope to re-instate that as soon as I can.  Other areas of spending are also being reduced, and I think that the two of us will manage on the new amounts.  I will probably cut back on life insurance now as well, since I have two policies and I think that one would suffice and would save us £15 a month.  I have applied for the single-adult Council Tax reduction and hope that that will come through by the time that the September payment is due.  I am pretty sure that I can get the monthly electricity payment reduced in the next few months when the regular meter readings begin to show a reduction in usage.I am continuing with the side avenues that I have had for some time for earning a little extra now and again - surveys on YouGov and the Shop&Scan habit - that has just scored me £60 of Amazon vouchers, which are coming in handy towards gifts at this time of year. Job hunting continues, and my sister has linked me in to a job at a local garden centre for which I shall send in my CV this week, even though I have little experience in that area!  It would be interesting....and a neighbour with whom I was chatting at the BBQ last night also thinks that there might be some vacancies at her daughter's place of work which would be suitable for me to consider, so I shall wait to hear from her this week about those.  I continue to look through the listings for local jobs on websites in the area, but in reality, I am aware that I really want a part time job of about 20-25 hours a week, in order to balance the need to earn some money with the desire to continue with the voluntary work and the F&W course for the church.  It'll happen when the right job comes along."},

A friend and neighbour has also been here this evening, helping out with our downpipe which wasn't coping very well with the downpours yesterday, so he brought home a new length from the builders' merchants at which he works, and he has, we hope, fixed the problem - we shall see how it holds up in the forecast rain tomorrow....And on one last note - several of us have hedgehogs in the garden, which is brilliant, and we are all pleased to have them there, eating up all the slugs.....but why do they have to poo all over the grass as well?!?!The weather is looking very rough for tomorrow in the UK, so I hope that you can all stay safe, warm and dry.  Take care of yourselves xx"},

It had rather a forced return today when I dropped a carton of eggs on the kitchen floor and four of them smashed....so I had to rescue them and make the first sponge in my new oven.  The oven has been in at least two months now, probably longer than that, and I hadn't made a sponge in it!  The ladies at the chapel were wondering, the head coach at gym was wondering - has she stopped baking?! I suppose I had - the FH and the EFG were supposed to be losing weight, and that meant that it seemed mean to bake lovely cakes and scones and biscuits and then not let them eat them!  However, today, I made a coffee sponge, and UJ has taken half home with him, and the other half is going to the jigsaw club at the chapel for their afternoon tea tomorrow.  It does look rather good - I'll edit in a photo tomorrow.My Skoda has just passed its MOT this afternoon, so it is good for another year, and UJ and I went shopping at Lidl to spend the £5 voucher I had, and to get some food for the week ahead.  He came armed with a list, and we managed to get all that he needed, as well as bits and pieces that I had run out of, and between us we spent the requisite £40.  He was very pleased with the prices in there, and think he may be back!I have also been to the library this afternoon, and luckily found a copy of a knitting book that I have been looking at on The Book People's site for a month or two.  I can have a look at it for free now, and see whether it is worth buying - I suspect I won't buy it now anyway.  There are SO many patterns available cheaply and for free on the internet that books are almost outdated for some subjects.  I can't get to grips with reading novels on the computer at all, I still want a real book for that - but printing off a knitting pattern is simple and easy to file.  I have downloaded one from Ravelry to make myself a wee short sleeved cardigan for next summer - the challenge is that it is knitted on circular needles and I have never done that before, so I shall be on a steep learning curve there.  Just a few more hats to knit for the OCC boxes yet, before I start any thing new!"},
{"title": "Tuesday's top tips for our holidays", "date": "Tuesday 29 July 2014", "text": "Back to moneysaving today and delighted to report that I have discovered that Tesco Clubcard are offering Cineworld vouchers for just £2.50 in Clubcard points for adult or child tickets.  They are now usually £4/adult and £3/child, so this does represent a saving on the usual Clubcard charge, and could save us a packet on the full cost of a trip to the cinema.Once the girls are home from the cruise, they are going to have to come back down to earth with a bump - no waiters in the dining room or stewards to tidy the cabin...but I am planning a few wee treats for them, and finding a deal like this makes it all the easier.  I hope that they can agree on something that we can all watch!One I took on a past visit to Oxburgh HallI renewed my National Trust membership in May, so we will be able to make use of that in the holidays as well; I feel a trip to Oxburgh Hall coming on - I love it there, as it is so peaceful and relaxing.  I may not be able to afford to renew the membership next year, so I am hoping to fit in a trip to Blickling Hall as well in August, as I haven't been there before and it is somewhere I have long wanted to visit - it is a bit further afield though. We shall, no doubt, do a fair bit of mooching around locally with friends, and I dare say that each of the girls will have a shopping trip to Cambridge or Peterborough before the end of the holiday, as their birthday money will probably be burning holes in their pockets - both have birthdays in August.  There will be some shopping to do for the EFG's new life at uni, although my sister has bought her a bale of towels, and I bought a set of crockery from a charity shop in Ely last week, from which she will be able to take some plates and dishes, as she won't need the whole set.We are helping to run a gymnastics holiday club every morning next week, which will definitely keep us occupied - busy in the mornings with the children and shattered from the experience in the afternoons!I don't think that the three of us will be going away for a holiday, so we will be having a break at home.  We need time at the moment to come together and enjoy one another's company whilst we can, but try telling that to two teenage girls - I have been refereeing them today via text and I am probably 700+ miles away as the crow flies! Thanks for all your comments - it is always lovely to hear your thoughts xx"},
{"title": "Influencing others", "date": "Monday 28 July 2014", "text": "I had a wee cheer to myself this afternoon whilst chatting with my aunt.  She had visited in the week before the funeral with my cousin and cousin's husband and I had sent her away with some pickles for my uncle, from the FH's stash in the garage.  She came out there with me to see which pickles he might like and was impressed with my two back-to-back wardrobe store cupboards.  She came back today with my cousin and in the conversation over a cup of tea, we were chatting about shopping.  I have been encouraging her to try Aldi, and asked her if she had been yet.  She shared some of the bargains she regularly picks up in Farmfoods and encouraged me to have a look in there too!  Then she said it - she has been inspired by my storecupboard and has started her own wee stash in a little cupboard in her bedroom - woo hoo!!!Thanks to our cupboards, and stashes, I still haven't done a \"big shop\" since the FH died.  We have veggies aplenty in the garden, and it is no hardship to get our five-a-day from the variety we have there.  The two fruit baskets we have received have kept us well supplied in that respect, and I am going to have to make apple sauce with the last of the apples so that they don't go to waste.  I am going to go to Lidl this week, as there are a couple of things we are running out of, but we don't need an awful lot.  There was a £5 voucher for when you spend £40 last week in a newspaper which I saw quite by chance, so I shall endeavour to make use of that, but I may go on Wednesday afternoon and take UJ along for the ride in case he wants anything too.Azura[image from simplonpc.co.uk]Life without the girls here is definitely quieter, but I am doing OK.  I have had lots of phone calls and texts from them, and they are having a lovely time - they were in Stavanger today and it was HOT they reported!Life on the ocean wave seems to suit them, and they are doing their own thing a lot of the time and just meeting up with my dad and MB for meals.  Dad is happy that they are having a holiday and he gets to see them often, but he isn't actually having to take them places or amuse them, thank goodness!"},

I would say that I have had a quiet time, but I haven't - between answering the phone to them about four times, I have also had my sister on the phone!  I called in to see UJ on the way home this morning, and have had a mooch around the interwebs tonight so I haven't had time to be lonely.  I like my own company, and I am looking forward to reading for a while now, in peace and quiet.Church in the morning, and then I may tackle sorting out my bedroom - I am concentrating on the north facing rooms whilst it is hot, and then I can do things in the south facing rooms later on - I do have to do the washing up now before I go to bed, but the sitting room is nearly sorted.  I have also picked a big colander full of dwarf beans tonight, from just one short row of plants, and must pick the other two rows in the morning before it gets hot again.  This variety is called Ferrari, and they are rather prolific!I'm about to wake the girls up!  They are off on their travels this morning - 0830 in Cambridge is the first stop to catch the bus down to Southampton.  We have suitcases packed, krone stashed in purses and Graze boxes [courtesy of the EFG's generosity] for the journey.  They are a wee bit excited!"},
{"title": "Staying home", "date": "Thursday 24 July 2014", "text": "The school to which I applied for the job sent me an email on Tuesday, which I found when we got home from the funeral.  I wasn't successful in the application, which didn't surprise me - but they did like the wee advert I designed as part of the process.  There were some very \"strong candidates\" apparently.  But, do you know what, I was very enthusiastic about the job in the application and interview process, but when I got home and I was mulling over the tiny office that I would be working in, looking out over a boring fence, and the restrictive hours of work, I realised that actually, I wasn't that keen any longer!  I would have done the job if I had been offered it, but it has made me think about what I am doing......I'm looking for a temporary job, one that will see me through a little while.  I need to get Faith&Worship finished, ideally for submission at the end of September, and then I will be able to talk to people about candidating for the Methodist ministry.  I may need a job whilst I train, to support the YFG and myself, depending on the training pathway that the church choose for me, if I get that far.  IF I get that far, indeed, but I have to try, because that is what I am convinced and convicted that I am asked to do.  God can be a right old nag at times, as He keeps reminding me what He wants me to do, and as much as I have realised that this is His plan since a time about 17 years ago, occasionally I get a giant prod from Him, and He says, \"Are you going to do this NOW?\" and yes, now is the time to get started.  We continue to grow here, and this will be a step along the journey.  How quickly this will take us from the Fens, we have to wait to find out. I suspect that it might not be for some time, a few years, perhaps.  Time to adjust.Today I am off to the undertaker's early on to collect odd items like the beekeeper's veil we put on the coffin, the memory stick that has the slideshow on it, and some CDs.  This lunchtime we are travelling to Ely to spend some time with the YFG's godmother before she wings her way back to Fife this evening on a plane from Stansted.  We are planning a picnic by the river, so the weather forecast looks just great.The girls have got suitcases and heaps of clothes all over the sitting room floor as they begin their packing for their trip away on Saturday with my dad and MB."},
{"title": "The final journey", "date": "Tuesday 22 July 2014", "text": "The FH's last journey was made today, and it was peaceful and beautiful, in its own way. The FH's son, let's call him FHS, and his partner, M, arrived here early and we went to the chapel together. When we got there, there was plenty to do, getting more chairs out, putting out cards on the seats for folk to jot down memories for us, and meeting the various friends who were going to do readings for us.  And then we began to greet people - and we greeted people for the whole of the next hour! We had the slideshow of the photos of the FH playing as people were settling into their seats, and I thought that the undertaker's chap would turn it off when the coffin entered and the service began, but he didn't, and I was really glad that he didn't, because it gave me and FHS something to focus on.  We both looked at the photos and thought about those, rather than looking at the coffin so much.It was better for us to be able to greet people as they arrived, and to share a few words before the stewards seated them in the right places - we had family in one section, the lunch club in another section so they were all together, and the younger, fitter folk we sent upstairs to the gallery!  The rest had to slot in where they could find a space. When the five bikers arrived, escorting the hearse, the coffin looked magnificent.  The six bearers took a few minutes to shoulder it, but they managed, and I walked in behind it, followed by the girls and FHS and M. We moved to our seats at the front of the chapel and the service began.The hymns were lovely, and the organist is a friend who plays each week in a chapel in the circuit, so she knew exactly what she was doing, and they were all good hymns that we loved.  The prayers were carefully worded, as well as being traditional, and the FH's heart donor and their family were also mentioned in the prayers.The YFG and I read the eulogy, which went on for nearly 20 minutes, as it was interspersed with the tributes of others - one from a teacher who taught with the FH in the 60s to 80s, one from a policeman who served with him when the FH was a special constable, and one from friends in Cupar.  The slideshow continued, as I said, and it was good to have it whilst we spoke.Moving from the chapel to the crematorium took a little while, but the service there was short and to the point.  The committal there was touching, but it was the Last Post which I can still hear, echoing through the chapel there.  It was a really fitting piece to have, but still heart wrenching too.Afterwards, we went to a local hotel for a wake, a celebration over tea and cake.  It gave us a chance to catch up with people who had travelled for miles to come to the service, and to have a chat with more local friends too.  We realised that we had people there from Leicestershire [Ang], Lincolnshire [my aunt and uncle, and the EFG's godfather], Norfolk [the FH's sister], Derbyshire [the FH's other sister's husband and daughter], Surrey [cousins], Hertfordshire [old neighbours who moved away], London [his nephew], Edinburgh [our old lodger], and Fife [YFG's godmother]. There were various people who we thought were coming but who were prevented from coming for various reasons, but mostly illness [Sweetblondieblueeyes and her husband, and one of our neighbours] and work-related things. People kept saying how well I was holding it together, and seemed amazed.  They don't realise that I have been grateful for every single day of the 22 years we have been together, and at the moment, my heart is full of gratitude.  He hasn't left me, abandoned me or walked away from me - he stayed for as long as he possibly could, and we were both happy that we had as long as we did.  I have cried, and still do, but I am afraid I don't agree with the little old lady who came up to me as she was leaving the wake, and told me, \"It won't get any better, my dear; you'll learn to live without him, but it won't get any better.\" We always knew that our lives would only overlap - he was 35 when I was born and had another life before the life we shared, and he realised that I would eventually have to carry on without him, and that is what I shall do, and do him proud in all that he has taught me, shown me and encouraged me to be."},
{"title": "Have I Got News for you.......?", "date": "Monday 21 July 2014", "text": "No, in a word.  The interview seemed to go well at the time and I answered all the questions to the best of my ability, and then I was taken off to do a task, which involved designing a wee advert for a parish magazine to promote the adult education classes.  This I did and managed to print it off as well. But I have heard nothing either way so far.Whenever we interview at the school here, we always let people know the same day whether they have been successful or not, so I was naively expecting to hear this afternoon.  I am a little disappointed, I suppose.However, I have had my first interview in over 20 years, so I am pleased to have survived that experience, and will be able to prepare for the next one with a little less trepidation.Thank you for all your kind messages, and we are probably as ready as we will ever be for the funeral tomorrow.  I know that many of you will be thinking of us and there will be a good few candles burning in our names across the world, and for that I sincerely thank you.  It is good to be held in such love."},
{"title": "Time", "date": "Saturday 19 July 2014", "text": "The days are passing so quickly, and yet it feels like it has been an age since the FH died already.  It has been nearly two weeks, and so much has happened, so many people have come into our lives from his past, and we have reconnected with people from our past.A wonderful coffin has been made for the FH, and I have seen it and wondered at the love which has been poured into the construction and engraving of it.  Cards are still coming, but the visitors have slowed up a bit this week, which is a good thing, because I still have to finish writing the eulogy.  The YFG has been at school and had support from her closest friends. I have been touched by the willingness and determination of people to come to the funeral, and sorry that I am not going to be able to spend the time with each one of them that I would want to, just through the pressures of time.  People are travelling from Leicestershire, Edinburgh, Norfolk, London, Northamptonshire, London, Lincolnshire, and those are just the ones that I know about.  The girls are a little bewildered at the outpouring of people from the FH's past who are coming forward. And, friends, I have applied for a job.  Just 18.5 hours a week in a local secondary school adult education office, to start in September.  I think it would be perfect, so I am hoping that I get through the interviews on Monday.  It is not the best timing in the world for now, but the job commences in September, which will be good for me.  The EFG will be at uni, the YFG will be going back to school, and it will be good for me to have some structure in my life - it is a temporary fixed term contract for a year, so it would help to get me started for now.  If I am unsuccessful with this particular application, I shall keep looking, and be glad of the practise with the application forms and letters!"},
{"title": "Give thanks", "date": "Tuesday 15 July 2014", "text": "The FH spent a lot of time in the last days listening to a CD of hymns, played mostly on a guitar, that I had bought when I attended the Methodist Big Pray earlier in the year.  Number 14 on the CD quickly became his favourite track, and if I ever left him in the car whilst I popped into a shop, he always asked for that track to be loaded on to the car stereo so that he could enjoy it whilst I was away.The track is called \"Give thanks, with a grateful heart\" which says it all for me.  We have so much to give thanks for right now, starting with a very happy 22 year relationship.  People are coming forward with memories of the FH which they are sharing with us now, and we are grateful for their remembering.  We have two lovely daughters, and lots of caring friends, both in real life and on the internet, supporting and encouraging us through this challenging time.On a very practical note, I am grateful for the stores we have built up, for the vegetables I am growing in the garden, and for the food in the freezers!  We are able to conserve our ready cash at the moment whilst our immediate future income is sorted out, as we look into bereavement benefits and I begin to look around for a new way of making ends meet.  I've had delicious new potatoes, runner beans and courgette from the garden tonight. The paperwork and organisation is occupying my time, but I had time to cut the lawns today and do some washing, as well as going to gymnastics for a while this afternoon.  I am also having some interesting times looking on the internet to contact some of the FH's old mates from his teaching and special constable days. One of his old friends has helpfully written a book, so his website was easily found!"},

{"title": "Fish and Chips ", "date": "Monday 7 July 2014", "text": "Hello YFG here,Our family is going through a rough spot and we are all very emotional at the moment.My dad, and a very well known man around this area died this morning and it is especially hard on my mother, who can't bear to tell you without giving the laptop water damage with all her tears, bless her. We all miss him, he was such a character! He had recently been very poorly and was looking forward to coming home. However, this morning we got an urgent call to come into the hospital. One of mum's friends had to take us as she was too shaken up and worried. They sat us in a room and the very nice doctor who had been looking after him broke the news and said that he was out of breath and passed away very quickly and peacefully. There was no suffering at all.There were many times when he would be quite frustrating and others where he would be very funny. We went through a list today of the people we need to inform about the funeral and we have thought of so many people, it will be hard for us to fit them into the chapel in the village. Some people are even coming from as far as Scotland. We have got so much support and so many people who are going to help us through this. But mainly we have each other. We are going to take it one step at a time. I am currently on work experience and I think I will go back on Wednesday. EFG and mum are going to sort the house out while I am at school/work and I will help when I'm home.For the funeral, we are going to put together a slideshow with a load of pictures of him and project it up on the chapel wall while people come in. We will also play Apache by the Hank Marvin as he always liked that song. Mum thought that it would be a great idea to get four BMW or other old English motorbikes to accompany the hearse through the village as my dad loved motorbikes. Last year, while my dad was still fit and well, he decided he wanted to make his own coffin. Now that certain circumstances have arisen, his son is now going to take that challenge on and is privileged to do that as it will mean a lot to him.The title originates from a church service. Once, the congregation was told to write down something that they were thankful for. My dad was sitting next to a very elderly woman who had no idea what to write. Being his usual self, he leaned over and said to the lady \"Put fish and chips\". So this is what I feel like, I don't know what to call news like this. I could have called it \"Tragedy in the family\" or something along those lines but I thought that this title was more creative and reminds me of my father. Now that he is gone, there is a big part of our lives missing. We are all staying strong and the three of us are coping well. Hopefully, mum will find strength to write more soon.Love YFG x"},

She's finding that the ladies drink an awful lot of tea, but that they are really kind and chat with her and generally treat her very well.  She feels welcome and part of the gang, I think, from the way she is discussing it at home.It has been interesting so far to see how she wants to fit in, spending time working out what to wear and how to spend her lunch hour.  So far she has taken sandwiches and sat and read a book, but today she thinks she might walk round to the library.  An hour is quite a long time in a 14y old's day, and she wants a bit of fresh air as well.  She is enjoying the freedom from the school rules, too, and the ability to have a cup of tea when she wants one, to go out in her lunch break, and to get up that teeny bit later in the morning - we leave here at 8.35am instead of her catching the bus to school at 8am.It will be interesting to hear her thoughts at the end of the two week period.  I have already heard some observations on the morality of selling designer glasses to old ladies who aren't interested in designer goods!  Good to know that she can think for herself."},
{"title": "Moving on ", "date": "Wednesday 2 July 2014", "text": "I had hoped that we were going to have a positive visit to Papworth yesterday....it wasn't too bad whilst we were actually there in that we saw a new consultant, who was lovely, and very thorough in getting to know the FH but then it all got a bit complicated when the blood results came in and the nurse phoned here at 5pm with changes to the medications.And I wasn't here, so the FH got in a bit of a stew.Apparently, he is neutropenic at the moment, so we have a change of immunosuppressant drug and a doubling of the steroid treatment he has been on for a while.  However, that is not as simple as it sounds.  He has been taking Cellcept for 15 years now, and this has been stopped completely for the time being.  A drug that was stopped early last year, Neoral, has been re-instated in a low dose.  However, we didn't have any of those here [well, you wouldn't, would you?!] and I didn't think that the village surgery would have any in stock either.  The Cellcept was stopped yesterday with immediate effect, and we were instructed to acquire the Neoral and start that this morning.  Mmmm.  Easier said than done.I was at the surgery at 8.30am when it opened, and I spoke to the dispenser who confirmed that there was none to be had there.  So I asked for a prescription for some, and she said it would be ready tomorrow....No, I need it now!  So I had to ask for an appointment for the doctor, who starts seeing patients at 9am.  There were three in front of me, so the dispenser and I agreed that I had time to bomb off into town to deliver the YFG at her work experience placement and get back in time.  This I did.However, my place in the queue was not held, and when I got back, I had dropped to 7th or 8th, and I sat in the waiting room for an hour - can't complain about that when the air con was on and it was lovely and cool in there!  It has been rather muggy here today.  I eventually saw the doctor, who was sympathetic and did ring through to the dispenser to see if there was any other way of getting the meds.  Realising that there wasn't, I acquired the precious prescription and came home. The EFG went on the internet and called up all the phone numbers of local pharmacies in the towns nearby, and I started ringing round to see who had got some of the stuff.  Luck was on our side and the first one I called had one box so I gave the lady our name and told her I was On My Way!The FH finally got the first dose at 11.40am, and then went off to the lunch club.  I had a well earned sit down with a cup of tea.  I did three loads of washing this afternoon, had a sleep and then returned to town to pick up the YFG at 5pm.  We also went to a different SW club tonight to get weighed as the EFG has a babysitting job tomorrow that means our usual meeting wouldn't work this week.  She's lost half a pound and I have lost 3.5 with all this rushing around!"},

This afternoon, whilst the stairlift was still under construction, a salesman from a bathroom company came to talk about a low-entry shower.  He's likely to keep talking - the flipping quotation was over £6K.  I could do a lot of bed baths for £6K so I think we will keep looking at that in the meantime.Tonight the FH and I are off to our \"country retreat\" [UJ's house] to be ready for our early start at Papworth in the morning, and UJ is probably on his way over here right now, so I shall have to go and pack our bag.Hope you are enjoying the gloriously sunny day we have had today, and I'll see you all tomorrow xx"},

The YFG accompanied me to take a service in the north of the circuit, but she declined coming in to the worship and sat in the car in the car park at the rear of the chapel, reading her book.  There were several downpours and she says it was a wee bit chilly out there, so when I went out to her after the service, she was wrapped up in my hoodie.  It was lovely to share worship here again as this is a particularly lively chapel.  We had a chap on drums, one on euphonium and two ladies - one playing the organ and one on the piano, playing perfectly in sync! After that, the YFG and I went to Aldi to spend the required £45 in order to redeem the £5 voucher from the Mirror this week - hope you got one if you needed one this week!  I have stocked up on lots of toiletries and tinned goods this time as some of the stocks were running a bit low in those areas.We spent the afternoon doing an extra gymnastics session with some girls who are entering a competition soon, and then we came home to make lasagne for tea.  We had time for a cup of tea and a wee break to relax before we got all the shopping put away and sorted out before the others returned home.And tonight - a big sorting out of this month's receipts and spending records....washing, washing up, and some tidying.  Off to bed now - the YFG starts her work experience tomorrow for two weeks and I am the taxi to get her there each day, so I have to be up and at it, ready to go out at 8.30am each morning."},
{"title": "Jack and Jill ", "date": "Friday 27 June 2014", "text": "Jack and Jill went up the hill and hills are a particular problem here - stairs in this case.  There aren't a lot of actual hills in the Fens, although I have heard of a village in a particularly flat area which has a Mountain Rescue team - I think it is an excuse to get together in the pub on a regular basis......The second stairlift man came yesterday, and gave us a bit of a ridiculous price for a contraption.  Honestly, paying three times what I paid for my car for a seat on a rail to go upstairs seems really harsh to me.  However, the FH had another wee episode after climbing the stairs on Wednesday evening, when I wasn't at home, and the EFG thinks he blacked out for a moment or two, so we can't wait on this any longer.  We are having a stairlift fitted next Wednesday - for £900 less than yesterday's quote because a) the chap has offered us a lift with a motor that has had three month's use, and b) because I negotiated a little more off that what he was at first prepared to offer. I had some good advice from ladies at the Craft Club this morning, who recommended that we go to the Citizen's Advice about what we might be entitled to as far as help goes in this and other things.  I will look into that next week.I had the lady here today who is my tutor for the Faith & Worship course, and we are still hoping to get the third big section done by the end of September, but we are both realistic and know that this depends on how things pan out.  Kindly, she recognised that sorting things like stairlifts and baths out for the FH is taking up a lot of my time at present, and that needs to be the priority.  She is a very good sort.And, by the by, I've finished an OCC hat this morning, so I am off now to have a cup of tea and at least cast on the next one whilst the FH is watching Mock the Week.  I'll tell you all about the bedsticks another time - I should think a few of you know what a bedstick is, but some of you might be as bemused as I was!!"},

{"title": "Learning to pace ourselves", "date": "Monday 23 June 2014", "text": "I seem to get here less often these days but I know you will be understanding.  Our lives have become a bit smaller and less outward looking these past couple of weeks - we seem to be hunkering down and drawing ourselves in a little more than we were.  It feels like we are pulling together and spending more time in each other's company whilst we can - we are acutely aware that the EFG's time with us at home is limited now and she will be in Aberdeen in just 11 short weeks. We are making changes in all sorts of ways.  The old three piece suite which we have sat upon daily for about 17 years is outside tonight, having been rained upon already, and is waiting for the council to come and pick it up tomorrow.  It has to be \"kerbside\" by 7am so we got it outside whilst we had help here yesterday and then the girls and I have moved it to the front driveway this evening.  I didn't fancy having to go out in the early morning to sort it out tomorrow.  It does look a little like Steptoe's yard out there tonight but it will be gone tomorrow.  The sitting room now looks a little like a bowling alley, as it has just two armchairs and a variety of odd other pieces of furniture left.  Today the FH and I went with the EFG to a local furniture shop and chose a couple of new armchairs.  I have paid a deposit and have about 6 weeks to gather together the remainder of the cash if I want to manage to buy them without damaging the savings balance........sounds like a wee challenge for me.  We felt that we had had our money's worth out of the old suite and it was just plain worn out - there are ways of rejuvenating furniture like re-covering it and buying new cushions, but I looked into that a few years ago and the 8 new cushions [4 places each with a seat and back cushion] were going to cost a small fortune, and the recovering was not going to be economical either - and I took offence when I did have a rep here from a well-known recovering company [sounds like a stone fruit] and he said he thought that a certain kind of covers I was enquiring about were \"out of my price bracket\" off his own bat - that would be my decision to make, not his!!The stairlift man was here last Thursday and yes, you were all right, and we can have one on our stairs.  He gave me his quotation, and then told me to get a couple more because the company has a price match guarantee which means that if I can get a cheaper quote, we can benefit from the lower price but still get a really good quality stairlift.  His company is backed by AgeUK, and used by a lot of local authorities, so it seems good.  We're still mulling that one over...The FH is pretty tired tonight because we have had a busy day - the wheelchair was delivered this morning and what with a ride around Sainsbury's and around the furniture shop, he's worn out with the heat we have endured here today.  It has been just that little bit TOO hot!"},

{"title": "Good news", "date": "Wednesday 18 June 2014", "text": "Delighted to report that the FH is looking better this evening.  Our prayers are helping - the doctors have revised their opinion and although the troponin is in the blood, indicating damage to the heart, they don't now think that he has had a heart attack!  Thank goodness - I can't tell you how relieved we all are about that. The current thought is that one of his medications has caused this so it has been discontinued with immediate effect - and now he has got a monitor to wear for 24 hours in the hospital.  If that shows that his heart rate and blood pressure remain stable, there is a chance that he will come home tomorrow.We had a good visit with him tonight and he shared that he had just enjoyed a good beef stew with dumplings - which made us all feel hungry then!  I have a chap coming at 11am in the morning to advise us whether our stairs are suitable for a stairlift, which will help us decide the next steps here.  I suspect myself that they are not suitable, but I am willing to be wrong, because I know nothing about stairlifts!This episode has been particularly worrying, with all the potential scenarios that the doctors were talking me through yesterday.  The physio that has seen him today has told him to pace himself and live for each day at a time, rather than worrying about tomorrow - good advice for us all, I think!  I shall phone the hospice and try to re-arrange the appointment there for whenever we can get back in the queue to see the consultant there, and perhaps it will be convenient to meet with our blogging friends too, although they have a move on the cards, so maybe we'll have to wait.  I am determined to meet them sometime soon!!"},

Seems to me that life is a bit like that for us at the moment: we are having some incredibly thoughtful days where it seems that all is doom and gloom and the only way is downwards, and then other days are bright and clear, just like this morning, and we feel ok about life.  More days like this are definitely required and less of the gloomy ones, but actually, that is what it is like - there are far more sunny days on the horizon just now than there is rain, so I hope that we can get through this season with some joy in our hearts, and just enjoy being."},

And they haven't failed yet!  They still have to make a presentation to the school assessor but the events of the weekend haven't spoiled their chances, thank goodness.

We have had an appointment with the nurse practitioner at the surgery to help her fill in a referral form for the FH to attend a local Sue Ryder hospice for pain management care.  I have also had a community occupational therapist on the phone to check a referral he has received and ask for a bit more information, so hopefully they will visit soon to advise on the things that the FH is struggling with, like the bath and shower....he had a bath last night and then I heard this little voice [good thing I was sitting on the bed], \"I can't get out!\" which was heartbreaking to hear.  Luckily, I managed to engage several strategies with towels and chairs to lean on, and we got him out.   He probably won't dare go back in until we have some better arrangements in place...showers all the way for now! A conversation at gym tonight and a small disagreement over something have triggered an emotional dam breaking down in the YFG and the poor girl has sobbed for nearly an hour tonight over all sorts of struggles that she has got tearing her in all directions, and making her feel overwhelmed.  She is going off on her actual Duke of Edinburgh expedition in the morning and I have to say that I am worried about her emotional strength to get through it.  We were all piled on to our bed tonight, trying to talk with her and reassure her, but it took quite some time before she felt able to stop.  It was hard, and made me cry to think that she had been bottling all these things up inside - we have promised that at least one of the things she is doing can be stopped this term, and we offered her the chance to have a break from her piano lessons, but she wants to carry on with those. My dad has offered to take the girls away again this summer, but his partner isn't completely in favour of the idea - he rang me up this afternoon and told me about two cruises that he has found on offer in the paper today: one to the Fjords again and another to the Baltic.  Neither are really suitable in my mind because the Fjords is a repeat of the last one, and the Baltic one is for two weeks - and I am totally selfish and don't want the girls to go away for two weeks, not in the last summer that we will be together before the EFG is off.  I offered an alternative which I thought was an ample compromise: renting a house for all 6 of us in Suffolk so that we could spend a week together, but have some flexibility - my dad could keep the FH company if they didn't want to go out so much, and I could take the girls and MB out, or my dad could take the girls and MB out for a meal, etc.  It would also be close to the end of the A14 if I needed to get the FH back in this direction to hospital.......we are looking for suitable holiday cottages as ideally we need it all on the level as my dad's now used to living in a bungalow.  Suffolk would be great as we have never taken the girls to Suffolk, the FH wants to visit Adnam's, and my dad loves Southwold.....Frugally speaking, I haven't been very focussed on the cash lately, and need to get to grips with it in all seriousness, as we have plans afoot for a downstairs wetroom...."},

{"title": "What to say next", "date": "Saturday 31 May 2014", "text": "It's hard to know what to say when things you have imagined happening in the future seem to be hurtling towards you too fast and too soon, and there isn't a damn thing you can do to stop them.  Events develop under your nose and you just don't put all the pieces together to see the bigger picture until someone who is further back points out what you don't want to see.  They do it kindly, and with the best intentions, but it is still like a smack in the face.  It hurts.Yesterday, the sleep clinic nurse was sufficiently concerned when I mentioned some of the FH's most recent symptoms, that she contacted the transplant clinic and we were sent along there to be seen by a doctor.  Although the two clinics are not that far apart, the FH almost collapsed on the mooch along the way, and I had to call for help to hold him upright - a nearby worker helped me to hold him whilst another fetched a wheelchair.  He was shocked at that episode and it put the wind up him before we even reached the transplant clinic.As we weren't scheduled for an appointment yesterday, we had to wait some time to see the cardiologist - a lovely man that the FH has seen a lot of over the past 14 years that we have been in this area.  When we did see him eventually, it was after a caring charge nurse had taken down some details, and done the usual BP and weight checks.  Finally I was able to wheel him in to be seen.The levels of fluid in the FH's body are rising, and his heart is under increasing strain.  The doctor described it as a stiff, thick balloon - hard to inflate and not very flexible any more, so it is not pumping the blood around his body very efficiently.  It is weakening, and at an increasing rate of decline, it seems.The doctor was kind, and explained that there are still a few other diuretics that can help with the fluid, but that they will exacerbate the gout and probably increase the level of pain that he is experiencing.  He has largely had the gout at a manageable level these past few months, and has always been able to walk around lately.  His weight is increasing, but we are aware that that is fluid retention.  The doctor, with the best will in the world, is running out of options for the FH, it seems.The FH was told yesterday that he should begin to think about how he wants to be cared for at the end. His words were that it is not \"imminent\" but that we should discuss it and investigate the options, that he will write to the GP and ask him to talk with us about support available.  Thinking about this, there are a lot of questions arising in our minds, and so we plan to speak with the nurse practitioner at the surgery on Monday when we go for the next INR check.Thank you for all your support and prayers - it means the world to me in all of this."},

We are both doing more exercise, so that is a positive point, and we are both well aware of the simple equation which everyone keeps pointing out: eat less + move more = weight loss....We're working on it!Good news is that I heard this morning from my Faith & Worship tutor that the Connexion [or Methodist HQ if you like] has assessed my work that was sent in at the end of March, and it has passed muster!  Very pleased to get that phone call this morning."},
{"title": "Mathematics all around", "date": "Wednesday 28 May 2014", "text": "I've had my fair share of time with a calculator today, I can say!  The girls went to the city on the train this morning, and then the FH went out to the lunch club, and I had some peace and quiet to check my emails: the temptation was easily overcome from online retailers such as The Book People, Cath Kidston and Sports Direct...not so easily overcome when that supermarket sent a voucher for £15 off when I spend £50.....that amounts to a 30% discount if you manage to get bang on the £50, and with delivery slots for just £1 now available, I thought it was worth a look.I haven't had a delivery from a supermarket for months, certainly not this year, and I still choose not to buy fresh fruit and veg in an online delivery because to start with I am not keen on the quality from that shop, and secondly, I prefer to choose my own.  So I had a good look around for all the offers - the two for ones and the buy one, get one a bit cheaper type things!  I stocked up on long term bottles, cans and packets, and UJ helped me by asking for some ketchup and HP sauce.It is useful to know your prices in this situation, and so I didn't buy anything that I think I can get more competitively priced in Aldi - margerine and tuna for example, as well as the fresh stuff.The other reason for having spent time with maths was that my cousin and her work mate came around tonight for some help with Maths.  They are both assessors with learndirect and have to help their \"learners\" with passing Maths and English qualifications as well as the actual subject in which they are qualified.  Dear Cousin freely admits that her maths is a weak point and so she came over to do a paper on her computer with us that she has to help her clients to pass.  I found the actual calculations easy, but understanding what the questions really wanted was a bit of a challenge, and I let myself down on one question where I did some of the work before I realised that the units of the information were mixed up and needed aligning before actual calculation could begin!  How people whose first language is not English manage to work out what the questions want, I do not know.  Four of us worked on it for over an hour to make sure that they understood what they were doing.  Glad I don't have to do maths any more, but having sympathy for the EFG who is doing her A level Maths papers in the next three weeks - I have got A level Maths, but I have forgotten most of it now!!I'll be getting the calculator out again tomorrow so that I can work on the June budget and figures for managing all the money.   See you then x(image from ksh.wikipedia.org)Apparently, it is Aldi voucher day tomorrow in the Daily Mirror or the Record if you are in Scotland.  I think that the amount you have to spend has gone up to £45 now, but it is still worth having if there is an Aldi near you and you have a family to feed.  It is ages since I have been along to Aldi so I shall definitely be getting a paper and popping in to get stocked up on tinned goods, and items like shower gel which we use lots of, and which don't go off!  Hope that helps someone x"},
{"title": "Losing the plot", "date": "Tuesday 27 May 2014", "text": "I think that is what the weather is doing - it is more like November here tonight than nearly June!  The FH is tucked up in bed watching tv with a hot water bottle and extra blanket on the bed, and the rest of us have been downstairs watching BGT with jumpers on.  The rain has been incessant today and the chooks are not chuffed with the reappearance of a sea of mud which they thought they had seen the last of for the season....oh dear!  They are still laying well, though, which is a positive point.The YFG has been to see her work experience placement manager today to get some forms signed for her time there at the end of June.  She was a little bit nervous as this was something she had had instructions to do very much on her own, so I dropped her off nearby and left her to it.  The EFG hovered in the town and met up with her straight afterwards and then I gathered them up again in the local supermarket car park.  She coped well and has all her instructions for the placement - she will be an \"optical assistant\" at the optician's that we use in the town.  The chap already has plans for her to set up a Facebook page for the business so that his regular assistants can just keep it going.  He knows she likes technology!My plans for a vegetarian day today got sunk when the FH declared that he wanted something warming for tea, \"with thick onion gravy\"........so I had to drag a Fray Bentos pie out of the storecupboard for him.  For the girls I made a potato-crust quiche, which fits in well with the SW plan, and so I served it to the EFG with veg on the side, and then the YFG decided that she would have a portion of her dad's FB pie with some of the quiche, which actually seemed like a sensible way to get her veg.  I've been naughty and had some cake instead of any proper tea......I'll do better tomorrow but they do say that a little of what you fancy does you good!  It mostly came out of the storecupboard and freezer so it was a cheap dinner all round and used up a few of our own eggs too.Tomorrow the girls are off on the train to the big city for some shopping.  I bought the train tickets for them today, and used my free Friends and Family Railcard, which I had had the EFG put on as the second adult just for occasions such as this.  Result as the YFG gets to go for £2 return, and the EFG's fare is the same as if she had used her 16-25 Railcard.  The free railcard only lasts two months, and I probably won't take advantage of the opportunity to buy a full one at the offer price as the I rarely travel on a train with the YFG...it has been the girls together or the EFG with me.  Anyway, they will make use of it now and possibly again before it expires, so something for nothing and a wee saving there.We were at the doctor's again this morning for the INR test, and the levels are settling now so the heparin injections have been stopped - the FH says that he didn't mind them, but he is jolly glad that they are done! Just the Warfarin to carry on with for now and have regular checks.  We are at Papworth on Friday for the CPAP clinic, so he is looking forward to the ride through the countryside, and I am hoping that the sun shines so that he can enjoy the ride more.  He doesn't get out much nowadays.I found this beautiful scarf on a blog today so just had to share - I love this pattern and it reminded me of the scarf that I am knitting for the EFG so I brought it out again and did a few rows whilst we were watching tv tonight.  I shall have it done before September...."},
{"title": "Good for me", "date": "Monday 26 May 2014", "text": "I've had a good day, one with plenty of good things included. For example, I went for a walk - up and down and up and down behind the lawn mower whilst I cut both lawns, in between light rain showers at lunchtime...I went to an exercise class - Davina's Buff Boxing DVD with the EFG in the sitting room.I had a relaxing hot shower and washed my hair after that, and then I was pampered whilst the girls took it in turns to plait my hair!I've had my favourite meal for supper - sweet and sour chicken with rice.  I could eat that every day :)The weather has been pleasant, and I have pottered in the garden too, tying up the raspberry canes, watering the tomatoes and seedlings in the greenhouse, having a cuppa and sitting outside, musing on all sorts of things.The FH has been out this afternoon with a friend to a bee club meeting not too far away, but he was on his feet for just a little bit too long and has had to retire to bed with his jigsaw.  The girls and I have watched the first live semi-final of Britain's Got Talent tonight, and now that all the silly acts have been weeded out, there are some really good ones to watch and enjoy again.  We have particularly enjoyed the illusionist, Darcy Oake, and the impressionist Jon Clegg.  I've ploughed through a mountain of ironing whilst we were watching.I know I haven't said much about the kitchen lately but it is still a work in progress.  I have cleaned out a couple more cupboards this afternoon whilst the YFG has done some more painting - she is a little star with a paintbrush!  We are hoping to get it done this week.Hope you have had a good Bank Holiday weekend, and that the rest of the week goes well.  With it being half term, we have some bits and pieces planned, but the EFG has her first exam a week today, so she has been revising hard - chemistry and maths have been on the agenda for her today.Yesterday afternoon, I spent more time in the garden.  I managed to turn this area under the old swing frame, which had been a tangled mass of weeds, into a much cleaner and weed-free planting area.I even found a couple of bean plants already growing which must have set themselves from last year's seeds.  I've been using this area, where we put the old swing, for runner beans, for several years now, and they are very \"hungry\" plants.  This year I have added some chicken manure pellets to the soil, just to give it a boost.  I have had a bucket of these pellets for years, and hardly ever use them as I have so much of the fresh stuff which I compost!The raspberry crop is looking promising.Little Gem lettuces are growing nicely in the greenhouse and will get planted out next weekend, I think.Another area where I grew runner beans last year, and this little lot have all set themselves again!  I have popped a few more seeds in around the base of the canes to make sure we have loads again this year as I really love fresh runner beans and would happily eat them every day in the season!Cucumbers growing nicely in the greenhouse.  We might get one or two nice cucs by the end of the summer...After spending all that time in the garden, there was time to pop the lambshanks and a rice pudding in the oven to cook for the supper.  Then I read a book for the evening - well, it is a BH weekend after all!"},

All in all, a restful day, when I even managed to finish off one of the library books I chose last Friday.  I've still got several more to read, but I shall have an hour tomorrow evening to catch up on my reading whilst the YFG is swimming - usually she would swim whilst I am coaching a gym class, but we have broken up for the holiday from gym already, so I have a smidgen of free time - if the weather is nice, I may go for a walk.Another weekend is approaching fast - I hope you have a good one x"},

{"title": "Just driving around", "date": "Thursday 15 May 2014", "text": "(image from hypermiler.com)I feel like I have hardly been at home all day today!  One of the downsides of living this rural kind of life is that most places are some distance away........the hospital, the piano lesson, the slimming club.....and we have done them all today!I had to go to the doctor's surgery this morning to pick up the FH's prescriptions [2 miles] so I combined that with a quick call-in at the school, which is on the way.  At lunchtime, I then went to grab the YFG out of school and take her to the hospital for her last physio session [round trip of about 60 miles] so I called in at the supermarket for the cheese I forgot yesterday.We hit home again at about 4.15pm, so I had time to chuck a stew in the oven for the FH, and then it was soon time to jump back in the car and head to the piano lesson [another 16 mile round trip] and whilst she was tinkling the ivories I nipped in at the library and picked up a stack of books.Home again for an hour, during which I took the opportunity to catch up on a phone call that I hadn't returned yesterday from a friend, and then it was off to Slimming World with the EFG [that's 18 miles around the fields and over the border into Norfolk].Finally, we are home and dry about 8.15pm and time to catch up with everyone all together!I can't imagine living where we do without transport of our own, and we are really lucky to have cars to take us where we need to go.  We don't waste fuel unnecessarily, though, and always try to combine trips where we can - although today is hardly a good example.  I would never have taken one trip to the shop for cheese and then another to the library for books separately, and have learned to wait until I am heading out for several things to make trips worthwhile.This month's big expense is going to be heating oil - another reality of living in the middle of nowhere is no town gas, so these houses were built with oil central heating.  The mild winter we have just had has meant that the tank of oil we bought last September has lasted longer than usual - we would normally have refilled the tank about March, so we have stretched it out a bit more this year."},

I noticed this morning that the occasional swelling that the FH has in his left foot, which he continually puts down to the gout, had in fact affected the whole of his left leg, which was noticeably larger than his right leg.  I managed to get him to the doctor before they closed the morning surgery, which was very lucky, and the doctor has been fabulous today.  The FH has been very worried that he would have to be admitted again, but it seems not at this point.Ironing now, and some Keeping Up with the Joneses on the Community Channel to keep me occupied for half an hour!  I have become fascinated with this and watch it occasionally - the whole remoteness of their situation is what has gripped my attention - interesting lessons to learn for if I ever get my remote and rural house in the back of Scotland's beyond, even if the territory would present completely different challenges!"},

I was interested in the news recently that the main supermarkets are beginning to struggle, and that Morrison's has had a 7% dip in like-for-like sales over the last year - I do like Morrison's and wish that there was one a bit closer.  I am going to read more about that tomorrow.The girls in Nigeria and their families are constantly in my thoughts and I cannot begin to imagine how their parents are coping in these very dark days.  I read about a church in America which has learned of most of the girls' names and is going to assign each member of the congregation to pray for particular girls by name.  There is nothing that will give those families any comfort until they are able to hold their daughters in their arms again, and that is what I pray for."},

At this point, the dry ingredients were carefully folded into the mixture, and then the bashed up chocolate was added as well, very gently.Heaps of about 2 tablespoons of cookie dough were well spaced apart on the baking trays, and then gently flattened.  Well spaced means that there were four on each tray!They cooked in about 15 minutes, but she kept a close eye on them, as well as employing a keen sense of smell and as soon as they looked done, they were out of the oven.  She let the others try one warm, and most were eaten whilst they were cooling, but the cooled cookies had developed a slight crunch as they cooked overnight, and there are those four left - I dare say that they will disappear in short order as soon as the girls get home from school tonight!  I would say that I think they will keep well in an airtight tin for several days, but I don't think they will at all - I think that they will get eaten too quickly for us to judge that one!"},

So whenever I am in the kitchen at the moment, I have the windows and doors flung open to get as much fresh air in there as possible.  The YFG did some more painting whilst I was at gym this evening with the EFG so I was met with a fresh wave of fumes as I came home.  I haven't spent a lot of time in there this evening - supper has been a \"do it yourself\" affair, although I did make a quick omelette for the FH. As well as painting, the YFG found time to make some wonderful chocolate chip cookies this afternoon after school.  In the absence of any chocolate chips, she bashed a chocolate orange that I won in a raffle at the chapel the other week, and used that - and the FH and EFG have decided that they are rather gorgeous.  I think that there are a few left....I'll share the recipe tomorrow and a photo if I can get one before they are all eaten."},

Just thought I would share the picture of the new plates at the top of the shelves, with my Bristol Blue teapot and gravy jug on the middle shelf and some mugs to finish it all off.  There is a blue theme, as you can see.  I loved the Bristol Blue design from BHS, but it has been discontinued, and I have been unable to buy any for years: I used to get it at a Kitchen Reject Shop in Kirkcaldy - I would pop in there whenever we went to Kirkcaldy to see what they had in store!  Sadly, over the years, it has been well used and loved and broken...these two items are all I have left nowadays.It has been good to make this shelf area look special rather than just piling it up with paraphenalia as it was!  I am working on thinning the kitchen stuff out as I go along, so the bin is getting rather full this week.  Better to bust the clutter than just put it back, I think."},

Today I cooked a big turkey leg from Morrison's, and it was lovely - the oven cooked it to perfection and we enjoyed it for our supper.  I am eyeing up some cake recipes too, so that I can get the cake tins out and give the oven a go with my favourite Victoria sponge recipe - that will be the real test.  If it can bake a good sponge, I will be over the moon.  The FH is hoping for a fruit cake, and since I bought some rum-soaked dried fruit from AF, he does have reason to hope.  Perhaps at the weekend, I will make a couple of fruit cakes and bake some potatoes for our supper at the same time - I love very slow baked potatoes the best.Not a penny spent again today, and another £2 earned from egg selling, so keeping the purse quite tightly closed.  This month has been a tricky one in all sorts of ways, but we are heading into May with positive thoughts.  I know that we have spent a decent chunk of money this month, but the bulk of the credit cards are already paid back on the kitchen spend, and I just have to wait for the invoice from the gas fitter now to clarify the whole picture of how much the revamp has actually cost. May will bring the YFG's practice Duke of Edinburgh weekend, when the rucksack will have its first outing, RQ, and she will be hoping not to get too many blisters on her feet.  I am having a day out to myself when I attend a district Day called The Big Pray near Bury St Edmunds - so for those of you who remind me to take some time for me, that covers that - thank you for the encouragement, and I am really looking forward to it. In the unlikely event that there are any other East Anglian Methodists reading this, if you are coming to the Big Pray, then let me know and we can say Hello when we get there!  I am also looking forward to spending more time in the garden and getting even more seeds sown.  The ones I planted some time ago are all through and need potting up....a gardener's work is never done!Thanks for sharing another month with us in the Fens - it has been good to read your comments, and many of you comment often now, so it feels like we are old friends!"},

These organisations are very good, and we have a great deal of appreciation for the excellent and very valuable work that they do, but when they put the most unwelcoming person at the door, you wonder why you bother! She hadn't eaten enough, she hadn't drunk enough, I wasn't allowed to help her fill the questionnaire in [I was told off quite sternly - \"this is a confidential document and it will be discussed only with the donor, behind a screen, in private\"]....I felt most unwelcome, so I left with the YFG!  I felt like saying, \"I'm her mother!\" but didn't.....Then the EFG was passed through the system and had good conversations with much, much more friendly nurses, both of whom asked whether her mum was there, so she told them about the incident at the door, and that I had left.  They were politely bemused, she said.  They fed and watered her, and decided that she could give blood after all.Except they then discovered that her veins are inaccessible, and said that she would not be able to give blood after all, and would have to be taken off the register.The FH has given over 50 pints, his cousin has made his century and my sister over 25, so she had hoped to carry on in the family tradition. I cannot give blood, and was quite squeamish even being in the room with all the people hooked up to the blood collection paraphernalia.  I can cope with a little blood, like from a cut but not a quantity in a phial and it all makes me feel sick and faint.  Not good.  I can't even look at the nurse taking blood for blood tests at the doctor's.  Bit useless on that front.  Sorry, folks!Having said all that, with the FH's history, we are all willing donors for organ transplants after we die, and we would of course recommend that those able to give blood do so if at all possible."},

{"title": "Different ideas, different places", "date": "Saturday 19 April 2014", "text": "I watched the Easter service from King's College Chapel in Cambridge this afternoon whilst I did the ironing, and I thought about how things have changed for me. (image from commons.wikipedia.org)Many years ago, I was part of a church which began to become a little bit more High Church than it had been - the pomp and ceremony was introduced by a new village vicar with grand ideas, and it changed the place a little.  I've been to the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church of Scotland, the Baptist Chapel, a mixed Baptist/Methodist/URC congregation since I was last a member of a Church of England congregation, and now I am very firmly settled in the Methodist tradition.  I've always worshipped the same God through it all, but the ways of worshipping have changed with the traditions - the Church of England was quite bound to liturgy, and we said the same prayers and responses week in and week out until we didn't really need the books any longer because we could recite it all!I caught a comment somewhere on Facebook today about the difference between churches which want to get more people into the churches, and ministries which want to get the churches out into the world.  I think that there is a huge need for the churches to minister in the world, because we have to take God out into the world to the people - and services like the one I watched on tv this afternoon would scare a lot of people well away.  The music was beautiful but rather inaccessible for most, and the Bible readings were from very old translations, full of words like \"spake unto\" which don't  help attract young people today.  The other thing they used which I didn't find encouraging in particular were ancient poems.  They do have their place, I am sure, and they are right to be respectful of historic Christian thought, but to the person in the street today, they are almost unintelligible. (image from cumbriaweb.org.uk)The people that Jesus called to be his disciples were fishermen, plain and simple men who could communicate with other people, not particularly well-educated, but keen enough to spread his word and follow him.  We don't need a doctorate to preach God's Word and to share His love in the world today, and the manual worker, the farm labourer [UJ], the bus driver [my dad] and the cleaner [my mum] need to hear the Word of God in language they can understand just as much as the scientist, the lawyer and the teacher [the FH] do.  Methodism has always been a grass roots denomination and I am clearer in my mind today than I have been before that it is the right place for me.We have noticed that our Friday morning group which comes together for our Knit and Natter session is as much a congregation as the group which comes together to worship on a Sunday morning; they care deeply for one another, they contribute to charity work and they are very generous with their time and their resources whenever we are fundraising, and these are the ladies who come together to do the chapel cleaning, too, most often!  They support chapel activities, and their fellowship group is a strong one.  Some profess a faith, others don't.  We welcome them all.As Easter morning approaches, I remember that Christ died for ALL of us, whoever we are.  The churches need to reflect that, and I need to remember to make my services accessible to the whole congregation, whether I am in a town or a rural village.I found this late last night, and it was too late to share it with you then, so perhaps some will find time to read it today.  Ann Voskamp posted a meditation yesterday on Jesus' on the Cross from his mother's point of view, which I found incredibly poignant and in fact, very emotional too."},
{"title": "Wolf in Sheep's clothing - beware!", "date": "Friday 18 April 2014", "text": "(www.theguardian.com)I was pleased to receive a call yesterday afternoon from the company from which I bought the hob and oven on Thursday.  The chap seemed quite pleasant, if a little too chatty, but he was interested in my feedback on the ease of ordering the products, why I chose those products and how I found the website.All very nice, and I thought I was getting good customer service.Then he told me that the products had a lifetime guarantee, and my little antennae started wiggling.  A lifetime guarantee on a hob and a cooker?  That sounded a little too good to be true....He then proceeded to tell me that this \"lifetime guarantee\" would cost me £8.98 a month to cover the two appliances, and would ensure that I wouldn't have to foot the bill for any repairs or replacements for the products in the event that they wore out or broke down.And then he asked me to \"confirm\" my sort code so he could begin to set up the direct debit.I soon put the brakes on that whole scenario, pointing out that he didn't know the sort code, so I wouldn't be \"confirming\" it because he was actually asking me to provide it.  I then had a go at him over springing this whole thing on me over the phone, pointing out that this wasn't a \"lifetime guarantee\" but actually an insurance scheme, which he wasn't too chuffed about.  Then I said that my previous oven and hob had lasted me 10 years, so I would be gambling on this one lasting only half as long at that rate - £8.98 a month over 10 years is over £1000, and the hob and oven together cost half that.  I could keep my cash and just buy another one when I needed them as I have done this time - and the balance of the gamble is in my favour, I hope!I am afraid that I also told him that what had started off seeming to be a pleasant customer service call had become a fairly hard-sell sales call, and I wasn't very impressed.  He was rather persistent, but he hasn't got my sort code, and I haven't agreed to participate in his scheme.  He has emailed me the details so that I can consider it.  It may take me a while....I often blog about how long I can make things last.  I shared back in January about these boxes of Persil washing powder - I made the last box do 78 washes in comparison with the 50 washes that the box promises.  So when I started on the next box, I used a different measure to scoop up the powder for each load.  I filled this little cup each time - it is an old measure from a liquid detergent bottle but it does the job.It made the difference!The box of washing powder lasted three months, almost to the day.But, best of all, it vastly improved the number of washes I got out of the box of powder - 123 compared to just 78!And, do you know what, our clothes were just as clean!These boxes of powder cost me £6 each, just before Christmas, and so I have improved the cost per wash from 8p down to just under 5p - even better!  A lot better than the recommended dosage which would be 12p/wash.  I am not sure that I can improve on 123 washes from a box, but watch this space, and in about another three months, I'll let you know!"},

{"title": "Cooking the books", "date": "Wednesday 16 April 2014", "text": "I have spent an awful lot of money today - confession time!  What started out with needing a new oven to replace the dead one has become a bit of a kitchen makeover, and will almost look like a new kitchen.  I have scoured the internet looking for bargains, and managed to save some money on what I thought I was going to have to spend.  The units will be the same, but the worktops are going to be changed, and the sink! Instead of having the range cooker that I had been dreaming of, I am going to spend less money but have more of an impact on the entire room, which pleases me no end.  We have been here ten years, and the house is beginning to look rather tired in places, so along with the refit, I shall also emulsion the ceiling and the walls - they never recovered from the splattering of the crab apple juice a couple of years ago!  It is time that this house began its journey towards becoming more appealing to the housing market, in case it has to go on to that market, and so this is one step in the right direction.So, what's the lesson in finance for doing this all on a budget?  Top tip number one is to have a stepson who has done time as a kitchen fitter, so that definitely helps, and then have a friend who is a gas fitter!  As for the purchasing of the materials - I have compared lots of places, with the restrictions in mind that I need to fulfil: a slightly shallower oven than most, because it has a gas pipe to fit in behind it! And the existing oven had its own legs and feet, so I needed one that didn't require oven housing units...oh, the joys!  Spending 20 minutes on the phone to ao.com this afternoon made me very glad that I had found a geographical phone number for them through the saynoto0870 website so that I didn't get charged a small fortune for the call, whilst the call handler desperately tried to sort out what she thought she knew about the oven I was asking 20 questions about!  Research has definitely been the name of the game this week.And paying for the actual items?  I have carefully spread three payments to three companies for various items across my credit cards, so that I maximise the time I have to make the payments over the next month.  I have crunched numbers seriously, looked at our income and expenditure patterns, and I know that I can make the payments and clear all the cards when the payments fall due.  I actually have the money in savings already and could have paid straight away but I do hate to pull money out of savings if I can manage not to, and using the card gives me the flexibility and means that we will do this work without touching the savings.  We won't make any payments into the savings pot this month, or next, but we will come out of next month with a \"new\" kitchen and all the savings we had at the start of this month. I promise a picture or three when it is all done - a lot of the things I ordered will be here tomorrow, but the taps will be delayed until next week, so the FH's son has just said that we will pencil in the date for the end of next week - that just about gives me time to get some painting and deep cleaning done!"},
{"title": "RIP Alice, the rabbit", "date": "Tuesday 15 April 2014", "text": "When I went to let the chickens out this morning, I noticed that Alice, the grey and white Dutch rabbit which we have had for some years now, was huddled in the corner of her hutch, not really herself.  When I came back in, I told the EFG to get up and come and have a look at Alice; we got Alice out of the hutch and I cradled her in my arms, stroking her, for about half an hour, and we gave her some water through a dropper. It was clear that she was in her last hours, and we wanted to make them as comfortable for her as we could. I sat with her in the greenhouse where it was warm, and then I brought her up into the conservatory, and the EFG prepared a box for her with some shavings and straw in it.  The EFG had a cuddle with her, and then I had her back, and held her for quite some time longer.  She began to move her head back and stretch a lot, which I knew meant that her time was coming, so I put her in the box so that she could be more comfortable, and kept stroking her, and talking to her.  Just after 10am, she took one last breath, a bit like a yawn, and she stopped breathing.  It was gentle and peaceful.Alice was descended from the first pair of rabbits that the girls had when we moved in here in 2004, quite a line of descent over multiple generations.  It is likely that she was one of the rabbits in the pictures in this post. Her death this morning came as quite a shock to us because she was as right as rain yesterday, eating and eager to see us whenever we were near her hutch - we kept popping over to see the rabbits a lot yesterday as we were outside for much of the day, and there was not a hint of anything amiss.   It struck me with some force later on this morning to realise that poor Alice's is the first natural death I have ever witnessed, and it really made me think.  Jennifer Worth writes eloquently and with feeling in her books about death, and it is a part of life we don't always think enough about.RIP Alice - you will be missed.Finally sitting down to catch up on the weekend and what we got up to in the Fens!This large piece of garden ground is to the side of the house, and had been separated off for some time, and was littered with wooden chicken houses.  The band of chooks has been reduced and so there is no longer any need for so many houses, although some of those had been redundant for some time.I have arranged for a friend with a rotavator to come this evening to turn this land over so that I can sow grass seed, and we had to get all the chook houses moved, so that is what the EFG and I did on Sunday afternoon.We heaped all the old huts on the driveway, and from there, we aim to get them recycled into firewood!For the rest of Sunday afternoon, I cleaned the conservatory out!  Had to put a dust mask on, because it was rather dirty out there, having been left to its own devices all winter - and there was quite a heap of cat hair accumulating in places too!  Now that the floor is clean, the lids of the freezers wiped down, and the seating area spruced up, it was just right to welcome my dad and MB for a Sunday afternoon cup of tea and visit when they arrived at 4.30pm.Shadow the cat was a little bemused at all the activity in the conservatory, but she is happily settled back in there today!The EFG planted out the white strawberry plants that she grew from seed last year.Delighted to find that the raspberry canes that the FH's friend brought are shooting up from the roots and producing new growth.  And the ones we already had are in full leaf and looking glorious in the sunshine!Monday morning the Head Coach came over and gave us a hand to clear another piece of garden for the rotavator!  This used to be separate chicken pens for the pop holes in the shed, but these are no longer used, so we want to turn this into useful growing areas again - I think pumpkins, courgettes and runner beans will thrive in such heavily manured ground!  It took well over three hours to clear the pens' structure, and the FH even came down to help - he didn't do a lot of walking around, but he did man the table saw and cut a lot of the wood up for the fire!We have also got some seeds sown at last, and this morning, we have continued with the demolition of the chicken houses, and I have also applied weedkiller for the front lawn - I use Verdone every year, and can really recommend it for killing the pesky plantain, dandelion and other rubbish that grows but doesn't harm the lawn.  Now I am struggling to find the energy to wash up, and the FH has gone back to bed for an afternoon nap!"},
{"title": "Where I live", "date": "Monday 14 April 2014", "text": "I haven't got the brain power to bring you up to speed with everything that we have been doing here yesterday and today, but I have taken lots of photos, so I will get to sharing that soon.  Suffice to say that I have been very active, busy and moved a lot of stuff onwards towards new ideas and projects - hurray!So instead of telling you that tonight, I am going to share this photo and some thoughts about the area I live: the Fens.  The EFG took that photo last Thursday night on our way home from the Slimming World meeting, and it was about 6pm.  This is a typical scene around here at the moment - windmills in the background, and a field of pongy oil seed rape - I have to wind my windows up sharpish whenever I drive past a field of this stuff or else I start to sneeze!  What the photo doesn't show is the other typical Fen feature, which is a \"drain\" or river channel, which is right at the front of the picture, and the light green grass is the river bank.Sometimes, when I am driving in the Fens, I can see for miles, and it reminds me of \"Little House on the Prairie\" from my childhood, when all you could see in the shots of the family on the covered wagon was grasslands for miles and miles - here it is fields for miles, flat and green or brown depending on whether it has just been ploughed or has a crop already growing.  The land around here is Flat.  Flat is the word for it - there is so much sky: the EFG criticised my photo above when I took it, saying that there was too much sky in the shot, but I replied that that was the point - the Fens are full of Sky!Do I like living here, you might ask?  Well, yes, I suppose I do: I have got used to it now.  It was a terrible change when I first came to the Fens from Fife, and it felt too wide open, too much sky, and not enough trees!  I didn't like it then, but it's OK now.  The sunsets are amazing sometimes, and it is lovely to be able to see so far on a clear day.  I do miss the hills now and again, though.  I am not a Fenlander, though, and the locals don't let you forget, in a kind sort of way - there is still a \"them and us\" feeling in the village but not in a bad way.  There is recognition that some people are incomers and others are from village families which have been here for generations, but mostly, the village families are  tolerant of the incomers to liven things up a little and bring some new ideas.  Those who come in and join in are welcomed more than those who come but remain apart!Thoughts for the day are for the child who fell out of a coach on the A47 near King's Lynn yesterday and who is very ill in hospital and for the family of the man who died after completing the London Marathon yesterday."},

The grass was also cut this morning, and two loads of washing hung out in the sunshine - what a glorious day we have had in the Fens today.  Driving through the fields this afternoon was lovely, but the oil seed rape does give off quite a pong, so I have to keep closing my window when we get too close to that.  The YFG has washed my car this afternoon too, so I was able to go out in a gleaming black vehicle.  Quite swish too.The FH also got up for about an hour today and had a mooch around the garden whilst we were packing the car for the tip trip.  He was pleased to be able to walk around the garden in the sun, and enjoyed being up and about, but was glad to get back to bed to rest his legs again after his exploring session.Hope you have all had a good day.  Craft Club and Worship Lunch in the morning, and then more de-cluttering in the afternoon, I hope xx"},

She is a gorgeous Gold Partridge Orpington.Today has been moving day for some of the chooks.  I have already shared my plans to downsize the flock so 9 ladies have moved up the road to my friend G, who absolutely adores chickens and has a huge flock.  She cooks up pots of veg for them every afternoon to serve with their mash, and they get only the best in love and attention.  She has taken back from me some young chooks I bought last autumn, and some of my older ladies, including our beloved Goldenburg, who is 5 now.  Just this evening, the three young cockerels have gone to a church friend who lives at the other end of the village, and has 20 hens of her own but no cockerels.  I think my three lads are going to think they have gone to chicken heaven in the morning when they see that they have 20 wives between them!So I am keeping my older Brown Sussex hens [the late Lancelot's wives and daughters] and some hybrid hens, all of whom still lay.  I have also kept my breeding gang of GPOs, so there is just the one cockerel left on the plot.  We have reduced the numbers from 27 hens and 4 cockerels down to 18 hens and one cockerel.  It should be more manageable, bringing the houses down from 4 to two, and so less work on cleaning out, etc.  I'll see how this goes and if it is still too much, the hybrids will have to go too.  The pure breeds will be the last to go, whatever happens.  I'm too sentimental, really!If you clicked on this post hoping to see plans for trips to foreign climes, you will be disappointed!  We have two weeks off from school and gym, and I plan to make good use of the extra time at home.  Granted, the YFG has optician and physio appointments and a revision session at school, so we still have to go places, and the EFG has to do loads of revision and past papers, but I have plans!To finish Unit 12 of Faith & Worship to keep to my schedule for completion.To start Unit 13!To acquire and install a new oven.To clear out the room which was once a dining room and is now being used as an office/dumping ground, and try to acquire some kind of single bed so that it can become a downstairs room for the FH whilst we get our decisions made about moving/extending.To get the verandah cleaned and tidied for summer use and enjoymentTo sow some seeds.To post on the local Freecycle for puzzles for the FH [thanks for that idea, Ang!] I have tried to log on there this morning but had to admit that I have forgotten my username so I am awaiting an email. I think that may be enough to keep me going for two weeks......how's your Easter break looking?"},

He didn't feel well enough to go out to the lunch club on Wednesday so that is £4.50 to add to the jigsaw fund.So looking forward to a bit of a break from routine over the next two weeks whilst the girls are off school.  The EFG's exams are looming so I know she will have her head in the books for most of the time, but I do hope to take them out once or twice for a change and some fresh air and sunshine - so please shine, sun!Hope you all have a great weekend xx"},
{"title": "Spring fever", "date": "Thursday 3 April 2014", "text": "There must be something in the air today, because I have been just like Frugal in Suffolk and my thoughts have turned to moving again!  We will have been here ten years in June, which is by far the longest we have stayed in one house since getting together - we did manage about 7 or 8 years in one house, but then we had a flurry of houses in short succession, rarely staying more than two years in any of them.......(image from housemovechecklist.com)Moving house costs money, though, so you have to be very sure that you want to spend that much, and that it is going to be worth it in in the end.  I did sell one house in Scotland for the price of an advert in the local paper, and no estate agency fees, which pleased me no end.  The last time we thought about selling, the estate agents were charging more than 2% of the selling price of the house, which seems rather a lot to me. There are a lot of internet based companies around nowadays, and selling strategies are bound to have moved on in ten years.(image from rightmove.co.uk)I have had a look at lots of houses on the internet this week, all within a ten mile radius of here, with the YFG's schooling in mind - and there is nothing that really jumps out at me and to which I feel drawn.Moving has entered my head now because of the FH's health, and a bungalow is beginning to look attractive. On the other hand, what I am going to have to pay an estate agent and solicitor to do the work would probably go a long way towards some kind of work on this house to make it more suitable for the FH.  We need space to have a bed downstairs somewhere - just a single bed - so that he can sit with his legs right up as he is not comfortable on the sofa or in a chair with his feet on a stool.  A wet room is also looking useful although we are managing to get him in and out of the shower these days a little more easily than we were. Adaptations are wonderful things, and just having a chair to lean on as he gets out of the cubicle is making a lot of difference.I am going to have to crunch a lot of numbers, as the American tv programmes call it, over the weekend, and perhaps speak with a builder or two about how the work would stack up.  My brain whirls with all this information and debating to think about - and the FH isn't really interested in making big decisions as all he contributes to the debate is a reassuring, \"whatever you want to do is fine with me.....\" - big help that is!Good news on the ISA this morning - I checked my balances and I have a nice little lump sum of interest which has just been paid onto the ISA balance - I do like compound interest, and it also increases the balance of the ISA without affecting my allowance too.  It cheered me up, because I don't seem to be able to save much from our income at the moment, with all the expenses pouring out of our accounts!Decisions, decisions - too much to think about - better head off to bed and dream about it all xxx"},
{"title": "Still thinking...", "date": "Wednesday 2 April 2014", "text": "I do mull things over and over sometimes, and I have to say that the £60 a week recommended amount for students to budget for their food at Aberdeen in self-catering accommodation is still going round and round in my head! We all know that it can be done much more economically than that, because most of us feed families on that or less in a week.  True enough, the students may have more constraints on their time and facilities than we have, and may even have more limited access to supplies, but I am still sure that that is a big overestimation.I have done some research, and there is a Lidl not far from some of the residences in Aberdeen, so that is a start.  I am sure that the EFG will make use of that, and not just buy convenience food in the local Spar all the time - even she was surprised at some of the prices on food in the shops, and knows that she needs to make some stuff from scratch.  I was pleased to see that Sainsbury's are all over the place in Aberdeen too, so I can use their cards where I load a card here with money and she has a card with her from which she can spend in the supermarket - I think that that might be useful now and again.  I don't know what the system is called but it is obviously marketed towards students and their families.The YFG has a passion for prawn layered salads from supermarkets, but at over £2 a pop, they are a very rare treat for her - but even she recognised that if she chose to live on things like that when she leaves home, she will have to live on Cup-A-Soup every other day in order to finance her salad habit!  Thank goodness I have a few more years to work on her...Building up the EFG's cooking skills to cover more meals, and her shopping skills to learn more about making the pennies stretch are both things we are going to tackle once her exams are over in June. Thank you all so much for the advice you sent when I asked about managing on student budgets last week - you were so kind and helpful, and all those ideas will be filed away for future use.Talking of saving money, I have advertised my chooks amongst my friends on Facebook as I really need to scale my responsibilites and commitments down somewhat.  I haven't had a lot of response yet, but I am hoping to move some of them on to new homes this Spring, so I have a little more time for other things.  We are also trying to get organised this week to clear out all the FH's beekeeping equipment - he isn't going to be doing much more carpentry and joinery, much less making any more equipment for local beekeepers, so the sooner we can get the shed cleared out of stuff, the better.  If we do decide to move, it will all have to go for sure - I am making lists to circulate amongst local beekeepers so that I don't have the hassle of advertising and selling through ebay.  I think we are going to sell what he has left at a hefty discount just to clear the decks........it feels good to be decluttering in this way, but it is not going to be a quick job!"},

Certainly hope the third time will be the lucky one....I am so looking forward to Monday - to being home and settled and not having to think about going away again for a while!  Getting back to normal routines, and looking back at the month and seeing what we have achieved - the end of the month review will come round very soon. Hope you all have a great weekend - and thank you very much for all the responses about the student life - we will have a little review of them all next week."},

The flat is brilliant, and I can see us using it again as I am sure I shall have to visit once or twice in the four years that she will be here. We have photos to share when we get home. I am not well acquainted enough with this tablet to be able to do that on here!Things are not brilliant at home and the gang back there are missing us dreadfully, unfortunately, so I know they will be glad to have us home tonight. They are having a treat tonight and UJ and the YFG will be picking up fish suppers from the best shop in the town after her piano lesson tonight.I have had a bit of a break from everyday life, spent time with the EFG, read a couple of books and even started some crochet.

I may even get around to the crochet I didn't do today: I went to church, came home and made lunch, then I cleaned out the chickens in between the showers, and my dad and MB then arrived back with one very shattered YFG!  The eight miles she had walked today has completely done her in, and she is very tired tonight, with aching legs and a blister or two....they found some pub toilets so didn't have to resort to bushes on this occasion...The FH's son has been asking me about family tree research as he has apparently found his dad born in Bedford, which he most certainly was not.  Must be someone else with the same first name and initial but now he wants to know more so I am going to have to resurrect my genesreunited account......here we go!"},

We had a laugh this afternoon when she got home as she has been told that on the expedition, she will have to either \"go\" in the bushes during the day, or politely ask at a pub if she can use their facilities...she's wondering now about whether we should investigate a She-wee!  I don't know what she will think of next!!Anyway, I'm feeling a bit rough with a cough and cold so I have an appointment with my crochet hook and some yellow wool tomorrow afternoon, as my dad is kindly bringing the YFG home again after her walk.  He will hopefully take some eggs home when he goes as we are getting 15-20 a day and I now have three trays on the side in the utility room...note to self to get oven sorted out so that I can bake some cakes for the freezer whilst we have a glut of eggs.  I will be putting two turkey drumsticks in the slow cooker to make tea tomorrow and I am looking forward to that.

{"title": "Just a foot", "date": "Friday 21 March 2014", "text": "The day was going quite well, and I picked the YFG up from school and headed off to gymnastics up the road.  Travelling along a fairly straight piece of road at about 50mph, I was chatting away with the YFG when all of a sudden there was an enormous bang behind me and I thought something had hit the car from behind. The rear side door window right behind me had broken - it had a huge hole in it and the glass in the window was totally shattered.  In shock, my first reaction was to pull over and put the hazard warning lights on, but I only sat there for a minute because the damaged window was obviously on the road-side of the car and it was too dangerous to get out and do anything there because the road was too busy.  I crept along and turned off at the next opportunity, onto the road which heads home.  I was able then to pull over into a haulage yard and stop to think, and try to stop shaking!  I rang the FH and he advised us to come home slowly, but I carefully pushed the glass out of the window and into the car before I moved off again, because I was worried about it flying out and hurting anyone.We made it home, and I called the insurance company.  They put me through to Autoglass who should be coming out to repair it, but I haven't received an email from them yet....the glass will be in the depot on Monday so it won't be repaired at least until then. We eventually made it to gymnastics, much later than we should have been, and the head coach wasn't exactly chuffed that he had had to do all the setting out on his own, but we had tried to contact him in a variety of ways to no avail, so we just had to explain when we got there.We can only presume that something either flew off a vehicle moving in the opposite direction, or such a vehicle threw a stone up.  I am just relieved that it wasn't a foot further forward that it hit or it would have been my window and I have no idea how I would have reacted to that.  I am also glad that it didn't happen on the same stretch of road yesterday when I had both girls in the car, as one of them would have been in the back of the car.  I have a £75 excess on glass on the car insurance policy so I have had to pay that and have no hope of getting it back from anyone - it was just an accident, and I have no idea how it happened. What a day!  In twenty years of driving I have never had anything as dramatic or as frightening happen to me before, so I hope it is the only thing in the next twenty years as well, as I can do without that kind of drama!"},

(image from en.wikipedia.org)March is shaping up well so far, with the spending columns looking a little leaner than they have been in the first two months of the year, and actually, the Slimming World plan is doing some good in that I am buying less \"unhealthy\" food and we are eating more fruit and veg out of the freezer, so there is now at least some wiggle room in the biggest of the freezers.  The FH's continuing stewed fruit breakfasts are also helping with that - he has worked his way through lots of redcurrants, blackcurrants and blackberries - doing him the world of good, too!Spending on books, gifts and DVDs has also been kept under control, mostly because we have been restrained and there haven't been any birthdays much at this time of the year for which we would buy significant gifts.  The YFG is getting the Hunger Games DVD but that was promised months ago as a reward for passing the Grade 2 piano exam, and I can't begrudge her that - she has just had to wait until it came out.Fuel costs have come down in recent months - the FH is having about £20 of petrol each month, which keeps his car ticking over, as he rarely goes out of the village in it, and mine is probably having about £80 of diesel each month, which is not bad going considering all the trips I make to gym, to chapels elsewhere and to various meetings.  I would like to use the car less in the village, but the EFG's bike is not in good shape at the moment, and that is the one I would use. The expenses for the train trip to Aberdeen have been put on the Sainsbury's card, which is getting me valuable extra Nectar points.  The bill will be paid off in full at the end of the month, just like we do all the cards each month.  Two of them are rarely used now, so I am thinking about cancelling them.And savings?  Well, not a lot so far but I have managed to get a couple of hundred pounds lodged in a little savings pot until the new ISA season opens and I can transfer it over to the ISA.  I have earned a little this month from gym coaching, so that is a bonus.  I was recently offered a position through an agency prepared to pay £20 an hour, but when I considered it realistically, the amount of travelling I would have had to do would have been a big issue, and being out of the house between 4 and 8 or 9 every evening would also have wreaked havoc on family life here as well as our other commitments.  It just wouldn't have worked, so I passed that opportunity up, somewhat sadly, as it would have been fun, and good to earn a little more.  The costs to the family were just too great - would have been more achievable with less travelling perhaps."},

{"title": "Blessed", "date": "Tuesday 11 March 2014", "text": "There are some amazing people out there in Blogland......and I have to say a huge and public THANK YOU tonight to one of them.She read about the YFG's need of all sorts of paraphenalia for her Duke of Edinburgh expedition, and she has so very kindly sent us a parcel today, containing a rucksack, which she said her son had used for his expedition and was no longer using, and so the YFG was welcome to it.It arrived this afternoon, well-wrapped up, and so I took a pair of scissors to the wrapping very carefully, and uncovered a lovely, good-as-new 55litre rucksack.  Picking it up off the table though, I exclaimed to the FH, \"Blimey, it's heavy empty - however will she lift this when it is full of her stuff?\"Answer - it wasn't empty!  The lovely lady had packed it full of things!  There were two mess tins for eating and cooking in camp, and presents for the rest of us too.  The FH was almost in tears to think that this unknown-to-him lady had thought of him and sent him a parcel of posh teabags and shortbread biscuits, I was thrilled to unwrap some gorgeous lavender soap and a Slimming World recipe book, and then, this evening, the EFG was delighted with a beautiful journal and a little butterfly with an inscription on it encouraging her to dream her dreams big!  And there's more - there was also a smaller rucksack tucked inside - probably big enough for a day's walking bits and pieces - lunch, drinks, waterproofs, etc - all matching the big one.This lady is one of my most regular commenters and supporters, and I am so very grateful for this amazingly kind and generous gesture towards us, I just can't think how to express it all!  \"Thank you\" seems woefully inadequate.  It is very heartfelt, though.  There are some wonderful people in the world.  Thank goodness."},
{"title": "Savers, spenders", "date": "Monday 10 March 2014", "text": "Just now and again, people like me who save money just have to spend the flipping stuff!  I am glad that I have spent the last two years saving like mad, because it is already shaping up to be a bit of a spendy year here, and it is only March.   However, because I have been in the very fortunate position of being able to save, I do have some money to make the necessary purchases.There's been the expenses of the train trip to Aberdeen, coming up at the end of the month:  I secured train tickets for two of us, one with a 16-25 railcard, for £205, by buying Advance singles from East Coast's website.  I managed to get the accommodation, a one bedroom [but two beds] flat for £130 for the two nights, so I have had to spend £335 on that trip already.  There will be a taxi from the station to the flat when we arrive, and there will be some food spends too, so they all have to be considered.The grill died sometime last year, but I didn't worry about it much.  Unfortunately, the main oven seems to have gone the same way tonight, so I have had to look at electric double ovens, and it seems that that is going to be about another £300 or so, with fitting, and disposal of the old one.  Now it has come to it, I can't put this replacement off too much longer, and will have to do some serious measuring and researching this week.Alongside that, the house is in dire need of some redecorating, so that needs thinking about.  The daft builders used MDF for the skirting boards and architraves, though, so I am not sure how well that will sand down for preparing to repaint: I was very cross when I discovered what they had done when we moved in, but I suppose it was cheaper....but we do love wood.I made the commitment to take the EFG to Slimming World for the six months prior to her departure for uni, and that is costing me £9,90 a week, so nearly another £40 a month from the budget, but actually, that is very worthwhile, and she is already reaping the benefits of this programme - I do hope she gets her half-stone award this week.Some decluttering and selling off of surplus possessions is definitely on the cards for this year, and perhaps that will help to redress the balance somewhat.  I have some gymnastics coaching on the go this term and hopefully that will put some of the Aberdeen trip cash back in the bank when I am paid at the end of the set of sessions.  Perhaps there will be more work coming my way, and if it fits in with the FH, I will go for it!"},
{"title": "Good day", "date": "Sunday 9 March 2014", "text": "Long day though.  Walking around Cambridge, EFG firmly in charge.  Bright sunshine.  Daffodils everywhere.  People sitting on the grass in the parks, enjoying the weather.  YFG enjoyed her course.  Huge shopping centres, not so great....home to the FH and a baked potato, followed by a short nap!  Ironing, Call the Midwife, knitting, bed.Night, all xA quick round up of some of the jigsaws that the FH has tackled this week.This one above is a lovely seasonal one, and one of the round ones which challenge him a little!  It is a glorious picture and one he enjoyed doing.  We borrowed this one from the chapel jigsaw group.This one also came from the chapel group and is called \"The Old fox of Glencoe\" but there are 5 foxes in the picture.  Unfortunately, there seem to be a couple of pieces of this one missing, which we will mark on the box for the next person.  This was a very challenging picture with all the muted colours of the heather-clad hills, and the tree was rather tricky too!  Unusually for the puzzles he has been doing lately, this one was not fully interlocking, so he found that hard going as some pieces just lay up against others.This one is from my charity shop haul when I went to Ely a few weeks ago.  The photograph looks better than the actual puzzle - the pieces are quite regular and look almost like tiles - the FH thought it was similar to bricklaying as the rows built up in the same way.I have been given the gift of an extra hour this morning as the EFG has been taken to Cambridge by the other girl's mother - there are two of them on the course - and I am going shortly to go to the shops with the EFG and then to pick the gym girls up at 4.30pm."},

{"title": "I survived", "date": "Friday 7 March 2014", "text": "I can't tell you how nervous I was today, giving a talk at the Women's World Day of Prayer service in our little area.  There were Church of England ladies there from three parishes, and ladies from our Methodist chapel and one other.  I am quite happy preaching in the Methodist chapels around here, but suddenly facing about 30 ladies from another denomination as well suddenly had me in a little bit of a cold sweat.  There was no reason for it, save for the fact that I know my way of preaching works in the Methodist chapels that I visit, and I was apprehensive as to how I would go down in the CofE tradition.  There were however several faces that I knew from the local villages, even though I didn't know that those ladies went to local churches. One lovely lady was the one who gatecrashed my 40th birthday party in the nicest possible way, and another is the mother of a boy we coach at the gym club.  Anyway, I survived, and several ladies came up to me afterwards and said that they had either just enjoyed the talk or that it had given them things to think about, both of which seem like good responses to me.  Thank goodness for that :)We are hosting it next year at the chapel, and the service will be written by the Christians in the Bahamas......I think that will be interesting and challenging at the same time and I am looking forward to it already.  I shan't be the speaker next year, but I have to help organise the whole thing!Apart from that, I spent the morning knitting the EFG's scarf at the Craft Club, and then I went to gymnastics after the service so today has been packed with one thing and another.  The FH has remained upstairs again today, snoozing and doing his jigsaws.  It seems to suit him to have his feet up on the bed but I am not entirely happy with him spending so much time alone upstairs.  I shall have to think about a way around this one as I don't want him becoming reclusive and miserable.  I am already concerned as the girls and I are going to gym in the morning and then the YFG has a gym course all day in Cambridge on Sunday, so the EFG and I are taking advantage of the trip to have a little poke around the shops, which I do not entirely approve of on a Sunday, but that is when the course is and I have no choice over that.  I have to while away 6 hours....there may be time to pop to the Fitzwilliam Museum in the afternoon - I love it there.  But the FH will be alone from 8.30 until at least 5, which I don't like.As I have shared on Sue's blog comments, I bought Jack Monroe's book when it came out, and I am looking forward to sharing how we get on with some of the recipes very soon.  The Slimming plan is making us try new recipes too, so all in all, we are shaking up the menu around here quite a bit, but trying to keep the budget under control alongside all the changes. Hope you all have a great weekend xx"},
{"title": "All the World Days", "date": "Thursday 6 March 2014", "text": "Today has been World Book Day and tomorrow is Women's World Day of Prayer - it seems that the powers that be are trying to gather us together to one purpose on some of these days. I daren't buy another book really, although there are several that I have my eye upon....the YFG brought home four of the WBD free vouchers, because her friends didn't want them.  She was quite incredulous - it means she can get £1 off each of four books, and she has ideas about the ones she might like - I'm so pleased that my absolute joy of reading has successfully been passed on to both of my girls.  Both of them are often to be found reading at day's end, reluctant to turn off the light until they have reached the end of the chapter - I know just the feeling!I am speaking at a church meeting for WWDP tomorrow, my first time for this occasion, and I am not sure what to expect.  The meeting is being held at the Church Rooms of our local CofE establishment, as their church is a bother to heat, and they want to serve refreshments afterwards anyway.  My sincere thanks to Ang for her support and encouragement in my preparation.  I spent a very peaceful couple of hours tucked up on the sofa with my books and papers around me this morning, writing the talk and then typing it up.  I know most other speakers probably had their talks organised weeks ago, but I am rather a last minute kind of person these days.  There just often isn't time to do it any earlier as I am busy doing things that need doing NOW.......such is life!Today, I've mostly pottered about, doing this and that, and generally having a day at home, until I had to fetch the EFG home from school.  She had stayed to do an afterschool revision session and so she was too late for the school bus, and Mum's taxi had to come to the rescue. We went in to the Co-op to buy a box of chocolates for an older lady at the chapel whose birthday is tomorrow.  I have to admit that there were a few offers on which I took advantage of, because I was confident that these were the best prices around.  Nouvelle toilet tissue, at £3 for 9 rolls, is something I always look for on offer, because I won't buy it at the full price of £5, but we like it and our septic tank likes it too, so we tend to use it most of the time.  Three packs of that, probably the last three in the shop, went into the trolley.  Branston beans, 4 packs for just over £1.30, three of those fell into the trolley easily, because they are usually over £2, although I had seen them recently for £1.50 somewhere.  I knew that this was a good price, and so I stocked up, as we had just about run out.  Knowing your prices is key to this kind of shopping, and it really helps. And finally, we went to Slimming World for our weigh-in.  After my 4lb loss last week, I stayed the same, but I am so proud of the EFG: she lost just one pound last week, but this week she has recorded a five and a half pound reduction!!  She was very happy afterwards, and really keen to carry on now, although she had had a few doubts in the week.  The lady told her that she only needs to lose another half a pound and she will have her first half-stone award, so she has something to work towards and look forward to now.We are looking towards the weekend AGAIN - I can't believe how quickly the months are flying past and before long it will be time to change the clocks again.  Another day closer to summer and another one with no snow and ice here, so lots to be grateful for........hope you are all well, and I'll hope to see you tomorrow x"},

{"title": "Not a pancake in sight!", "date": "Tuesday 4 March 2014", "text": "Well, I thought I would be different! There are lots of posts in my blogroll tonight about pancakes, but we haven't had them here tonight - the YFG and the FH made themselves some mini-doughnuts with the doughnut cooker machine whilst the EFG and I were out at gymnastics, so they have had enough fat and sugar to last them a couple of days!It's been quite a day and I am looking forward to retiring to bed with my knitting shortly - I had the tea cooked and cooling by 8am this morning, and have been to a meeting about my coursework, and taken the FH shopping, and then I went to gymnastics.  The FH wore himself out pushing the trolley around Aldi so he went to do his jigsaw in bed at about 8pm, which meant that the sitting room was quiet with no tv on, and I could phone my friend for a catch up - half an hour later and I had to get off the phone to go and do the washing up.We are watching less tv nowadays as well - we seem to watch specific shows, but are getting much better at turning it off when there is nothing we want to watch.  Same as yesterday, it means we are getting more done IRL.And so tomorrow is Ash Wednesday and we are moving in to Lent.  Forty days of what?  Some people would have us believe that Lent is all about going without, abstention and misery.  I like to think of it as a time when I can spend more time trying to get a better handle on the Bible and on Jesus, so I will be doing things to further that aim rather than doing without.  I have been trying to read through the Bible this year with a template of readings I can tick off, but I have missed quite a few lately, so it is my intention to grow a little more diligent with that, and catch up with where I should be.  Easter is such a joyous time in the Christian calendar that spending time in preparation is definitely time well spent.  Ann Voskamp has a downloadable devotional for Lent on her website [link in the sidebar] and so I shall also be spending some time with that.Haircut in the morning at 10am - it's been six months or more so I am definitely in need of a trim!  I don't really worry too much about getting my hair cut as it spends most of its time up and I don't notice how long it gets, but the trim will cost me £7 so I really ought not to begrudge that as a semi-annual expense. My friend in Somerset tells me that the waters are going down now, but that a new wave of despair is hitting people as now they are able to actually go to their properties and see the devastation that the water has caused to their houses and their belongings.  I am cross that the news programmes seem to have moved on and forgotten about these people, as their story is still one of heartache and problem after problem.   We remember them and pray for them, and I made as much of a donation as I could afford at the time to a fund for the local people which my friend alerted me to on Facebook.  I am sure that others are thinking of the people in these areas and wishing them well too."},

{"title": "Photo round up", "date": "Saturday 1 March 2014", "text": "I have been faithfully taking pictures of all the jigsaws that the FH is doing, and this is the latest selection.Most of these have been lent to him by the puzzle group at the chapel, or I have bought them in charity shops or for a £1 at the surgery, like this one below.This one below is a celebration of Cadbury's chocolate, and was lent by UJ.This fabulous one of steam trains came from an older lady at the chapel, and the FH fell upon it with glee!  He absolutely loves trains, and this was right up his street.Noah's Ark came from our charity shop trawl in Ely last week, and he found it quite hard going.  Some of the pieces are actually shaped like animals.  It is a great picture.And this is wartime Paddington Station.  The detail in this one is incredible.  That it is wartime is evident by the uniforms, soldiers with kitbags, and sweethearts bidding each other farewell!The girders in the roof were apparently particularly tricky!I made the EFG take this photo for me when we walked to chapel Craft Club last Friday as I pass this patch of snowdrops in the car every day and never have time to grab a picture. This is the scarf I have just finished tonight for the YFG.  It knitted up quite quickly, which is a relief, since the EFG now wants one too!  This is Rowan Renew recycled yarn and I think it is great.  This colour way is slightly more blue than it appears here, and it is called Diesel.  The EFG's is going to be in Garage, which is more grey in tone.And finally, this is a lighthearted celebration of the sunny days we have had this week when I have been able to hang the washing outside and revel in the clean fresh smell of line-dried laundry.  You can't bottle it, no matter how hard the conditioner manufacturers try - there is no substitute for FRESH air!Off to bed with a cup of tea now - been to gymnastics, shopping at Lidl, cleaned out all the chook houses, and made tea, finished the scarf and done three loads of washing.  Time to stop.If anyone wants an Aldi voucher from this week's paper [valid until next Thursday], I have a spare one because I have acquired a Lidl voucher which is only valid for this weekend, and actually more convenient for me to spend today!  So I am happy to share the kindness and send the Aldi voucher on to the first commenter who wants it - I will post on Monday.  Hope that it is of use to someone this week."},

{"title": "Fen news", "date": "Thursday 27 February 2014", "text": "I am shattered!  After two meetings back to back last night, I took the FH and went to UJ's house and we collapsed into bed at 11.30pm, only for him to spend several hours tossing and turning, suffering with pains in his feet and just generally not getting comfortable.  It was 3.30am before we were able to get to sleep properly, and then we were up again at 6.45am to get to the hospital by 8.15am.........we sat in the waiting room and all he kept muttering was that he wanted to go home! The hospital news is that the fluid is building up again so the diuretics have been changed and hopefully the new one will get the water shifting.  We are back again there in July, but have carte blanche as always to call them with any concerns in the meantime - and I always do - they are incredibly patient and helpful whenever I ring and I have nothing but admiration for the clinic staff who help us out.Once we got out from the clinic at 11am though, I thought that the FH was going to collapse in exhaustion before I could get him to the car - he slumped against someone else's car on the way to ours and I was worried, but I managed to get him in and buckled up for the journey home.  Arriving home, he went straight to bed, where he has been ever since.  He had a good long sleep this afternoon and is feeling more normal again this evening, thank goodness.  A couple of long days have just worn him out completely and it is going to take him another couple to get back to where he was earlier in the week.Tonight the EFG and I have been for our first SW weigh-in, and it was OK.  The EFG lost a pound and I divested myself of four somehow - I was quite chuffed but didn't get too excited about it. I am so proud of the EFG for achieving a loss this week, and of how well she has stuck to the plan.  I am hoping that as she loses more weight, the insulin-intolerance that the consultant says is affecting her will reduce and she will be able to lose more.  Even 10% of her body weight will be a huge achievement so that is what she is shooting for at the moment.  I could see that the time spent at the group discussing everyone's losses and gains was quite boring for her, but one lady shared that she has lost 5 stone in the time she has been coming to the group and so that certainly inspired me!In other news, these two teenagers of mine are costing me a small fortune!  The EFG needs a cheque tonight to pay for two re-sits of modules she is going to do again in the summer exams, I have just paid out £75 for the YFG to start doing the Duke of Edinburgh Award, and now she says she needs new trainers and all the kit list for the DoE.  Along with the expenses of the Aberdeen trip in this next budget period, we are all going to be losing weight because we'll be on rations, I reckon!  There is only so much money in the pot and when extra expenses come along like this, other areas have to be cut back, as is only sensible.  None of these things are extravagant and unnecessary - I really think that the DoE will suit the YFG immensely and with her being of such a practical mindset, I believe that it will be money well spent to enable her to gain an qualification for her CV which reflects her personality aptly.  Conversations today about her future career have ranged between the army and the police on the one hand to being a midwife on the other hand, so you can see that she will definitely be Doing Something.Night night - thanks for visiting and I hope to get back to more regular blogging next week.  Take care xx"},

I'm off now to do some tidying up and ironing so that I can leave the place tidy for UJ and the girls tonight.  I may get back to have another trip round some of the blogs I missed this morning, if I get a chance for a cup of tea later, otherwise, I shall see you all tomorrow.  I am hoping to be able to report some successful weight loss after we weigh-in tomorrow evening........PS A very warm welcome to the new followers - good to see you and hope you find something interesting to read.  Leave us a comment now and again :)"},

It has been weird today with the girls going back to school again after having had them at home for a week.  Quiet and peaceful, but strangely a bit lonely as the FH has been in bed all day resting his feet and doing a jigsaw of Paddington Station that he borrowed from chapel yesterday.  It's another Ravensburger one and very well made.  The picture is quite finely detailed and he is finding it quite a challenge - but it keeps him occupied and awake!I have got all the documents ready to submit for the first two sections of Faith & Worship, and I am taking them to my tutor's house next week to check through it all with her and then it is going in the post to Methodist HQ for assessment.....nerve-wracking much, as the girls would say!  Still, I am very chuffed to have got it this far, and just hope that it all passes muster.  I hope that the next 7 units just don't take me three years to get done - I need to rev this up a little whilst the FH is in reasonable health, as it was last year's illnesses which slowed me down.  I shall put the flags out when this goes in the post next week as it will represent a considerable milestone for me.Frugality this week is being focused on staying out of the shops and keeping my pennies in my purse.  I have put the lunch money for the FH on Wednesday, the Slimming club money and the piano lesson money all in little envelopes so I know that I have the cash set aside for each of those things.  The girls are making their lunches for school and the FH and I are staying at home as much as we can this week - he has an appointment at Papworth for a check up on Thursday and I have some meetings to go to but thankfully I shall avoid temptation because none of them are anywhere near a shop.  I have been mulling over having a supermarket delivery once a fortnight, as some of the shops have good offers on delivery passes at the moment.  One of my neighbours has a regular Thursday 5pm delivery from that supermarket, and I wouldn't feel as bad about having a delivery if  I ordered one at the same time, but I am not sure that I want it from them, so that defeats that object!  I hate to see the vans coming on to the estate two or three times a day some days and just wish that the shops would find a way of letting us know when someone else in our postcode area is having a delivery so that we could contribute to saving some petrol usage - for the environment's sake, not the shop profits, by the way!Anyway, time I was thinking about tidying stuff away and heading to bed as I have an early start in the morning.  Cheerio!"},

{"title": "Walking and cinema", "date": "Friday 21 February 2014", "text": "We have had another good day together today doing half-termy things! The girls and I packed up our crafts and went to the chapel group this morning: the weather was so bright, clear and sunny that we decided to walk the mile there, and hope it wasn't going to come on to rain when we had to walk the mile home again!  It didn't, and we had a good session of knitting and chatting at the group.  The other ladies were pleased to see the girls, and wanted to know how they are and what they are up to.The EFG received an official letter this morning, which turned out to be from Student Finance England with an offer of finance for her first year at uni.  We may not know for sure where she is going, but she has the offer of the money to go with now at least....After a quick bite to eat, we set off to the cinema this afternoon with one of the YFG's mates in tow.  The Monuments Men was the film of choice today, and the Tesco Clubcard vouchers just about covered the cost for three of us - now that I shop there less, I consequently get less vouchers, but I had just enough this time.  We may have to go less often in future, as I refuse to pay the exhorbitant prices - and it was very chilly in there too - they are skimping on the heating these days.  I wished I had put a thicker coat on!(image from bbcamerica.com)I really enjoyed this film and it was very interesting to find out more about a part of the Second World War that I had not heard about before.  I'd recommend it, and there was a very broad age range of people in the cinema with us this afternoon, so I think it is appealing to a wide-range of audiences.Yesterday evening, the EFG and I joined Slimming World, as we have just six months before she leaves here and I want to help her to develop some strategies for losing weight and keeping it off, and we are both hoping that this helps.  I could do with losing some weight too, so we are a mutual support group for one another here during the week, and then we are going to see the group each Thursday night for an hour.  It isn't too far away but it isn't on our doorstep, but there are groups in every direction from here and this one just fits in quite well with the weekly schedule.  It's going to cost me £9.90 each week, but I think it will be worth it for six months, especially if it helps her.  We have planned to set aside time tomorrow morning to work out how to modify our menu plan and prepare a supplementary shopping list for the week ahead.And I am still knitting....plenty of time for knitting as the computer is still not fixed!"},

{"title": "A bit of knitting", "date": "Wednesday 19 February 2014", "text": "The EFG found this pattern and wanted to try to expand her range!  We both had a go, but hers is better than mine because her knitting is tighter than mine.She found it here at Knitting Bee, and I'd encourage knitters to go and have a look at all the free patterns.  We plan on trying more of these lacy ones.I'm still working on the scarf for the YFG which is progressing nicely in that I am on to the 3rd ball of wool, and the EFG also wants one, in a different colour.  I have also started a diagonal square with a little border which I am enjoying because it is really plain and simple, knitted in garter stitch and a pleasure to knit.We have UJ here tonight staying over because the girls want to go out tomorrow and the FH is not up to coming too: the YFG is going to Peterborough on the train, so I shall have to drive her and one of her friends to the station, and then the EFG and I are going on a little road trip of our own to Ely.It is too long to leave the FH on his own, so UJ will keep him company for most of the day.  I expect that I shall be home by 4pm at the latest, and UJ has plans for the evening, so he'll probably leave soon after I get home, but I am very grateful for him coming.News on the computer is that the chap is finding it a bit challenging.  He has tried a new power supply unit and that isn't the trick, so he's trying other things now.  He has been updating me through messages on FB but I guess he will ring me tomorrow with a verdict as the EFG will be booting me off her laptop shortly.Hope you are all well."},

This morning, though, when I went out to let the chooks out, I noticed that the greenhouse had moved.  This is a glass greenhouse on a small concrete wall base, which the FH in his wisdom [ha!] said that there was no need to screw the greenhouse down to the base as the weight of the glass would hold it down.......it moved two inches last night!  I have no idea how we are going to move it back, and I checked on it several times during the course of the day to make sure it hadn't gone any further, and the rabbit which had been living in there was evacuated quickly this morning to a fresh abode, probably a lot safer!I went out again mid morning to check that nothing too much was on the move, and noticed a fence between two of the runs was moving around a great deal, and since it was partially attached to the neighbour's fence, I thought that I should take it down in case it came down in the wind and damaged the neighbour's fence in doing so.  I was doing this on my own, it was quite a substantial fence, and the wind caught it as I was manoevering it, sent me flying on to my backside and caught me a blow to the forehead, upon which I saw stars for a minute, and had to come in and lie down once I had secured the panel....I had to lash it to a ladder bracket on the back of the shed as otherwise I was afraid it would have gone sailing over into another garden and done more damage!  It was only a dividing panel to keep two sorts of chooks apart, but we can manage without it for now.The FH has spent the day in bed, not that there is anything actually wrong with him, but his ankles are swelling and the only way I can keep them from puffing up too much is to keep him in bed!  If he gets up, as he did yesterday in the late afternoon, the fluid soon settles round his ankles and makes them uncomfortable.  He is quite happy there, and seems to think that being in bed is a small price to pay to avoid another spell in hospital.  He has the tv, upon which he watches the Olympic speed skating whenever it is on, he has a couple of magazines someone send him the other week, and he has a beautiful steam train jigsaw that I was lent at the craft club yesterday - with the aid of the back of the one of the EFG's GCSE Art pieces for a table, he has done several hours at that today!  He missed three days of a diuretic tablet last weekend because of a mistake the surgery made with his pills, and I am hoping that once the medicine builds up in his system again, his ankles will be fine again.

Every morning in this showery and blustery weather, I put on my outdoor gear.  It comprises of a rather large [much too large, actually!] waterproof coat that my mother bought me in 1992, a crochet hat that I bought from a LETS exchange lady in 1996, and occasionally some wellies that were the FH's and date from way back when.  I must look a sight, but since only the chooks are going to see me, I don't really care.  Those things do the job that I require of them - to keep me warm and dry whilst I do the garden chores each day.Most days, I am still wearing those Value jeans that I bought from that shop for about £10 some time ago.  There are two blue pairs and a newer black pair now, and they are my \"out of the house/looking presentable\" uniform.  They do all occasions, at school, preaching, doctor, dentist, shopping, visiting, etc.  And with them, a pair of Lakeland walking boots.  Pretty much all year round, I live in those boots.  They are comfortable, presentable, and I could walk several marathons in them, I am sure.  I bought two pairs of them many years ago: there was a lady's pair in navy blue for me and a sandstone pair for the FH.  I wore mine out and they went in the bin several years ago, full of holes, and he had not worn his more than a handful of times, so I am wearing his out now!  I shall mourn them when they go as I know I shan't find another pair.And the sofa we sit on is easily 16 years old, if not a touch older.  Getting a wee bit threadbare here and there, but still comfy.  Still does the job, even if it is now covered in throws to make it a bit more presentable.  The FH loves a recliner with footrest that my Dad passed over to him when he bought a new electrically-powered model, and the other argued-over chair is a wing chair that the FH's sister gave to the EFG.  I don't think we have ever darkened the door of DFS or SCS or whatever those sofa emporiums are called!My thought for the day today is that I need to extend this contentment to other areas of my life.......Thoughts today for the people of Oxfordshire and Somerset whose lives are being turned upside down with all this water.  We sang \"Shine, Jesus, Shine\" this morning in chapel, and I thought it rather an unfortunate choice when we got to the line about flooding the nations, albeit with grace and mercy.

She's laying there in the dark, with a cold flannel on her eyes.  I have given her some paracetamol and I hope she will sleep again now.  Caring for her as well alongside the FH is going to be full-time, I think, so I just hope he doesn't catch it from her, although he has had the jab; lots of washing of my hands is on the agenda, and trying to keep them apart, I suppose.  She hasn't been this poorly since she had swine flu about four or five years ago."},
{"title": "Construction frustration", "date": "Monday 27 January 2014", "text": "There is the expensive way of doing something, which is sometimes the easiest way, and then there is the FH way. We have to resurrect an old chook house in order to move some of the chooks onto some fresh ground, but there are parts of the house which are beyond repair - the floor and the roof.  The easy thing to do would just be to buy a new little house, probably for about £100.  It would come flat-packed and I would spend an afternoon with an allen key and put it together, like I did the last one I bought, several years ago.  But we are doing it the FH way, so one day last week, we made the floor.  Today, we made most of the roof, and we have it ready to felt tomorrow.  Then we have to find some new hinges, repair the nest box area in the house, and put it all back together - it is sectional.The FH hasn't been doing anything in his workshop for the best part of a year, and so it comes hard to him, especially at this time of the year when it is cold.  So I am required to be there to help him, and I am pleased to be there, because it IS for MY chooks, when all is said and done.  BUT there is a good deal of moaning, muttering, the odd cussing, and lots of generally dismal thoughts shared.  Just keeping the positive mood in the room is hard work, even before I hammer a nail too close to my fingernail...I don't think I would have been good enough a carpenter to work with Noah on his ark, but the way the rain keeps coming down, I am sure someone must have thought about building another one somewhere very soon.  I am sure that the poor people living on the Somerset Levels must be wishing for some kind of rescue vessel.I have been reading Elaine at MFin3 today about making dulce de leche in her pressure cooker, and I am sure that a pressure cooker will be on my shopping list by Christmas.  They seem incredibly useful, but since neither my granny nor my mother had one, they are beyond my sphere of experience and I seem to be managing quite well without one so far.  I shall think about that one some more.  I dare say that some of you would recommend them - has anyone had any bad experiences with a modern one?Actually, I know some people really dread Mondays but I like Mondays the way I love September and the New Year - it is a chance to start again, on however small a scale!I have had a quick check through the bank balances this morning, and when I go outside in a minute, I need to read the electricity meter - I keep the key to the meter cupboard in my outdoor coat pocket these days - saves trying to come in in muddy boots to fetch it from the utility room shelf!I need to scuttle around the house quickly and do some housework this morning, and then I have to pick up the YFG from school and take her to Peterborough hospital to meet a physiotherapist about the headaches she gets.  The consultant we saw before Christmas seems convinced that the headaches stem from knots in her neck, but the YFG doesn't think that the physio will do much good since she herself believes that the headaches are sinus-related. I filled the car with diesel on Saturday and so I am planning a no-spend day.  I need to have a run of them this week to stay in my budget for the month, and in reality there is nothing we need.  With the AF order coming next week, and the weekend shop at Aldi done, we have a full fridge, larder and stores!The end of the month is looming, and so I need to gather everyone together to sort out the February menu plan.  I think I shall present them with a list of the available ingredients and see what they can come up with, bearing in mind the daily constraints of time and people available to cook.  I am firmly in favour of the whole meal-planning scenario as it has been amazing this month [again!] to have the plan in place on the wall in the kitchen, and not to have to try to work out what to cook each day.  It has also helped to balance out the different kinds of meals we enjoy."},

This afternoon, I have spent some time with the YFG sorting through her revision books and helping her to work out what she needs to do.  The amount of homework that she is getting is nowhere near what I got at her age, and even in this modern age, still not as much as the EFG got in the same year group three years ago.  The school is trying to drive up standards and aims for the children to achieve, but seems reluctant to give homework.  Whatever the folk at the top say, I firmly believe in homework, and so in some ways, we are going back to some of our home-education ways, and she will be doing some consolidation work at home.  Now that the course is linear with all the exams at the end [the way things used to be!], she has got to learn to retain the information for much longer, so all the consolidation she can get will help her.  This is something that she understands our concern about because she saw how much work her sister did, and realises that she doesn't \"get\" everything.(image from mortgagefreeinthree.com)I managed to work my way through the Approved Food website and find enough that I wanted to put together an order to make use of my free delivery code.  I ordered some of the Gluten-free breadmix that Froogs was recommending too, so I shall look forward to making some of that bread and hoping it tastes good.  All I have to compare it with is Sainsbury's Free From bread, which is OK but really not brilliant and quite expensive.(image from collider.com)We three girls spent some time on the sofa this afternoon, watching a film called the Robot and Frank....I think...it may have been Frank and the Robot!  Anyway, it was a good film on Netflix and one we had been trying to watch for some weeks.  It deals quite sensitively with a man in the early stages of some kind of dementia where he is clearly losing his memory and the ability to recognise people.  The FH is battling with a 500 piece puzzle - it isn't huge but it does have an overabundance of foliage on it, which always bamboozles him rather.  He is still struggling tonight, and he has been at it on and off all day.(image from digitalspy.co.uk)The supper was cooked whilst Countryfile was on, and then the FH retired to his puzzle whilst we watched Call the Midwife: he always thinks there is a little TMI, but we enjoy it.  I have read all of Jennifer Worth's books and found them very interesting, particularly her attitude to death.  I shall probably read them again and again!I would like to tell you that I spent some time knitting or doing crochet, but I didn't.  I will get back to it soon because I find it very relaxing.  One thing at a time."},

Days where the cars didn't move off the drive and we didn't even venture out the front door.  Days when I wore my scruffy house/garden clothes all day.Peaceful days that he spent most doing jigsaws, staying awake instead of nodding off by the fire, so that he slept much better at night.Days when I \"got things done\" like sorting out the car insurance, juggling the monthly budgets around to allow me to pay for a combined policy instead of two separate ones, but now they both renew in January instead of spreading the cost over January and February!Days when there was time to pull leeks from the garden, peel UJ's potatoes and enjoy a free lunch of leek and potato soup - warm, comforting and very filling.  And we love it so much that we did that on more than one day.This week my days at home need to include re-arranging the chicken houses so that the chooks are less muddy, sorting out a mammoth ironing heap [again, I know.  Kids should have fewer clothes.] I have to spend time looking at the EFG's finances for her hoped-for new life in Aberdeen, and what she will be able to afford.  We've got forms to fill in for scholarship applications too."},

{"title": "Lesson of the day", "date": "Sunday 19 January 2014", "text": "Before you travel to a chapel you have only ever visited once, over a year ago, make sure to check the map.  When you leave the house 45 minutes before the service starts and find yourself in the middle of the flat plains of the Fens, with no landmarks in sight and not a soul to guide you, you will start to panic.  You will flag down passing white vans, and even they may not have heard of the place you want to be!  You will look frantically in the boot for the map book - it won't be there....and you will fall happily into a small newsagent's shop and the kindly chap behind the counter will take pity on you and draw you a map!  You will make it to the chapel with FOUR minutes to spare.  The congregation will forgive you.......and even ask you to come again.Such was my morning.  The congregation were amazingly welcoming and I shall be delighted if I am asked back there.  It was blessed, and uplifting to be there.This afternoon, when the FH and I got home, by a more direct route, we sat and talked with the girls for about an hour, and then later on, the FH's son and his friend dropped by, and we talked for another good hour.  Tonight, I have watched \"Call the Midwife\" sat on my posterior, so I think that I can safely say I have had my fair share of just sitting today.  I hope you have had a restful weekend, and I am looking forward to catching up on some of your blogs tomorrow."},
{"title": "Catching up", "date": "Saturday 18 January 2014", "text": "Occasionally, a cat's life looks appealing, don't you think?(image from commons.wikimedia.org)Tomorrow afternoon, I plan to sit.  Just sit.  Possibly the tv might be on, the girls may be busy chattering, or doing Just Dance on the Wii, the FH may be doing yet another jigsaw, but I hope to do nothing.In line with my plan to go slower this year, I am finding that actually, I have to carve out space for \"nothing\" time, or else there is always something that I could find to do.  As I sit here typing tonight, I could be washing the kitchen floor, starting on the mount of ironing, packing my bag for the morning's preaching, looking through today's receipts [spent money today - whoops!], washing up after dinner......but there comes a time when a body just has to say, \"No, tomorrow will do for that.\"  \"Or even Monday!\"  I have about an hour now before I need to go to bed, so the washing up will get done, and I will iron my clothes, but I have told the girls that they have to do their own ironing tomorrow.Knitting and crochet are good for me, in a relaxing sort of way, but even that has a way of making me feel that I should be Doing something - I am conscious that I haven't got anything on a needle this year yet, and I am teased by my mind saying, \"Come on, cast on a hat!\"  All things in moderation, I think that the wisdom recommends.  Finding moderation would be a start, some days.Wishing you all a peaceful weekend, with some time to sit and stare occasionally thrown in!  Rest and relax just a bit.The bum-narrowing campaign, that is!  The scales have new batteries so that they can tell me a tale of woe this morning, and I walked two miles yesterday to craft club and back.  I shall pop in and record how I am getting on with Frugal In Bucks, and I shall have to keep track here a little bit as well.  We all know that the basis of losing weight is eating less and moving more, and neither of those things necessarily cost money, so we should be OK.  Don't wish me luck, wish me willpower and motivation!"},
{"title": "Menu planning", "date": "Friday 17 January 2014", "text": "Menu planning is not my favourite chore, I have to admit, so perhaps that is why I am now finding that planning the whole month is a relief - just do it once and it is done until the next month!  This is also fitting in with our pantry principle way of shopping because we are making the menu up from what we already have in stock, in the most part.  We know what our routine is for this term with gym and piano lessons after school, so it is easier to schedule simple meals on those days each week.  It makes the shopping trip simple because as I make the menu plan, I just jot down odd items that are needed to supplement the stores, and the fresh stuff like cheese and fruit that we need as well.I have come across a couple of \"new\" meals that will probably make it on to February's meal plan, which I think that the girls will like as they include pasta!  I am also trawling through Jack's recipes for some cheap and cheerful inspiration - someone posted on FB the other day that there was an article in one of the papers telling us that we cook the same meals day in, day out!  Well, I guess that we have a standard repertoire that we know our families like, but we do enjoy some variation in the Fens.  Eating seasonally is cheap, and when I have leeks growing in the garden, I make soup - I love it! UJ brought us cabbage and some kind of broccoli [but not the kind you buy from the supermarkets, if you know what I mean - he calls that calabrese] and last week it was kale.  The rabbits enjoyed wee bits of that as he did bring a huge basketful but then I put some through a rissotto one night when the gang were eating something I couldn't, and it was lovely - brought back memories as we used to grow it in Cupar.  I have hinted that we could use some more....and joy of joys, I collected three eggs from the chooks on Monday - they must think it is spring with all the mild weather we have been having! And I have declared my intentions on Frugal In Bucks blog today - my bum hasn't shrunk any at all so far this year, so I am joining in with her Weightloss Wednesday challenge.  I am starting today, just as soon as I have bought some batteries for the scales so that I can weigh myself!  It won't be good, so I shall just post the ups and downs."},
{"title": "Book review of a thrifty title", "date": "Thursday 16 January 2014", "text": "Grandma's Ways for Modern DaysI spent half a week looking after someone's chickens a few years ago, whilst they went on holiday.  The YFG went with them for part of the time that they were away, and when they came home, they brought me an egg poaching pan, and this book.  They thought it would be interesting for me - and they weren't wrong.  Some of the girls' friends have called us \"old fashioned\" but this family understood where we were coming from, and they kept chickens, had fruit trees in the garden, grew some veggies and had a woodburning boiler in an outhouse! The book is a lovely trot through lots of \"old fashioned\" type ideas, but with a modern edge to them all.  There are beauty treatments [I should probably try some of those!], household cleaners to make, soap to try, as well as lots of \"grow your own\" advice before it moves on to backyard livestock - hens, bees and ducks are covered.  Making your own bread, and then butter and cheese appear.  There are sections on cooking family meals, and a bit of home brew too!  Preserving the garden's bounty is also an important section.I have found lovely hearty recipes in here like Lancashire hot pot and leek & potato bake, as well as Christmas feasts and home made toffee.  I haven't got a favourite section as I just love the whole thing! It is a book for the modern times but with all the wisdom of the past recognised and respected.(image from theediblegardenshow.co.uk)The authors, Paul and Diana Peacock have written other books, and apparently appear on BBC Radio as well as writing the Mr Digwell column for the Daily Mirror.  I can't say that the black-belt tightwad will learn anything from this, but it would certainly be interesting to get it out of the library and have a good nosey through it.  I was very glad to receive it as a gift.(image from dunmowbroadcast.co.uk)This lovely lady was a great influence on my life, and she was much beloved of my mother too.  She was my kindergarten teacher when I went to school in Cambridge.  I was in her classroom for two years, and loved her for ever!  My mother kept in touch with her all her life, and up until this year, I always got a Christmas card from her - and I sent her news and photos of the girls.  She was always fair, gentle and kind at school, and all the children looked upon her fondly.  She had very long days, travelling up from Little Dunmow to Cambridge every day in her trusty old VW Beetle.She is 90+ now, and was awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Years Honours list in 2013: it was very well deserved as she ran a Lent Soup Kitchen at her home for over 20 years, raising money for Christian charities all those years.  She has always been active in her church and in the community and is very well loved.  Looking on the internet for a picture of her to share with you, I believe I have also found a picture of her wedding day:(image from felstedremembers.uwclub.net)Little Dunmow, 1945I am ashamed to admit that I haven't seen her in years, and it should be one of my aims this year to go and see her."},
{"title": "Top Tips", "date": "Wednesday 15 January 2014", "text": "I had a thought this afternoon - a random thought that just popped into my mind, and I laughed.  \"TopTips for new students leaving home for university life.\"  I was reading a guide on the Aberdeen uni website, and this one wasn't there:#1 - Make jolly sure that there is loo roll left on the roll before you sit down as you won't be asking anyone to fetch you a spare one!We are going to Aberdeen in March, the EFG and I.  Another adventure is planned but this time we are going north instead of west, and this time the train is taking the strain, instead of me and the Skoda.  The EFG needs to get a 16-25 railcard, and I just have to take the hit and pay the fare as the only way I could get the ticket any cheaper would be to take the YFG with me and have a Friends and Family Railcard.  She can't miss three days of school, so she can't come this time!  I have looked at some of the hotels that the university recommends for people attending this Visiting Day, and they are not cheap - the one that tops the list comes in at £299 a night.  I think not.  But even the \"budget\" hotels are looking at £99/room for a night.  That seems steep, and would still leave me with the cost of eating out.But I have a solution.  There are self-catering flats in Aberdeen, and they are relatively reasonably priced - I have booked a one bedroom [twin beds] flat for 2 nights for £130.  For me, that is a bargain and good for my health as I will be in full control of my food, and we will have all the comforts of home.  The deposit was sent off today, and the lady in the office has promised that the time our train gets to Aberdeen [9.15pm!] will not be a problem. We will arrive on the Tuesday evening, attend the day at the uni on the Wednesday and then have until 2pm on the Thursday to look around Aberdeen a little before we catch the train home.  Hopefully the EFG can catch a doze on the train, because it will be after 10pm when we get home but she will still have school on Friday.I am enjoying the planning and the scheming to achieve this for as little as I can whilst making sure that we do what needs to be done."},
{"title": "Home clothes?", "date": "Tuesday 14 January 2014", "text": "I am sitting here feeling quite scruffy this morning, with a pair of old yoga trousers on, a warm fleece over a Tshirt, thick socks and a bodywarmer over the lot.  Keeps me warm!  This is the morning kit for today, useful for dealing with the chickens, picking and trimming leeks for soup, and sorting out the laundry.  It has also kept me warm whilst I have been doing some coursework. I wouldn't dream of stepping out of the front door in this get-up though!I would have to \"get dressed\" in order to leave the house or garden.  I tend to dress this way at home in order to save the clothes that I wear to present myself to the world!  It doesn't save much laundering this way, as the clothes still get dirty and need washing, but the point is that the better clothes don't need washing as often, because they are worn less, and so they don't wear out as fast - because I understand that the agitation of the washing machine and the whole laundry cycle probably wears clothes out more than the actual wearing of them!The girls also do this but in the evenings when they come home from school.  They usually change into leggings, jogging bottoms, or even PJs, in the case of the EFG - she has accumulated about 10 pairs of these trousers!  I bought her a pair for Christmas with penguins on them, and they are a favourite pair now.  All the supermarkets sell them, in cotton mixes for summer and fleece and flannel for winter.  The YFG usually wears leggings, and it is an ideal time for her to wear out the older pairs that might sport the odd hole."},

Sometimes there are things I want, and other times, I don't need what they have on offer, so I pass.  There had to be a small extra shop on Saturday to get the lunch meat and a couple of things which I either couldn't find in the Co-op or thought were too expensive in there....So I have also bought:Two tins of spaghetti hoops for £1.00 [This is what happens when I shop with help.  I really try to shop alone.]Risotto rice £1.10 for 500g.  I still think that is expensive but it was cheaper than the Co-op.Cheese spread £3.00.  This means 3 rounds of Laughing Cow Light Cheese Triangles.  They are good for the EFG as they are only 25 calories a triangle and she uses them instead of margerine in her sandwiches.And the lunch meat - which is what I went for in the first place - £3 for two packs.Grand total of £8.10 which I believe takes me just over my £25 for the week ahead, but since last week was under budget, I am not going to panic.Spending ahead - shouldn't be much!  The FH's £4.50 lunch club on Wednesday and the YFG's piano lesson on Thursday are already worked out and in the budget, and there is everything I need in the house already for the meal plan for the week. The only thing I have to spend on that I know about is a fish tank for my step-son, who has found it on Gumtree and asked me to get it for him because the seller is much closer to us than to him - but I have hopes of getting that fiver back again!  I have to text the seller today and organise the collection.(image from dailyrecord.co.uk)AberdeenI have an account designated as a Travel Fund in my bank line up: it started because I needed to save £450 for the EFG's sixth form bus pass.  The account still sits there, even though the last bus pass is bought and paid for, and there is the grand sum of £5.10 in it!It occurred to me at the weekend that I had missed something out of my budgeting when I was doing all that at the start of the month. We are going to have a pretty major trip somewhere to take the EFG to university in September!  It may be as local as Lincoln, which we could do in a day, but it might be Aberdeen or Aberystwyth, Keele or Reading.  The first two I am sure are going to involve an overnight stay, and Aberdeen would probably need several nights, as well as a tank or two of diesel....this is going to cost me!She has also been invited on \"visit days\", and would really like to attend the one in Aberdeen in March.  At first estimate, this is going to cost about £500 for the train fare and one night in a hotel for the two of us! Since this might very well be the place she decides to spend the next three or more years, I do think she deserves the chance to have a look around, however briefly!So I reckon I need to aim for about £1000 in that account, one way or another.  It might not entirely cover the cost of a long trip, but it would provide a buffer in that month.  This is in addition to the already planned savings, and will have to be siphoned off from other things as and when that is possible.  Once I find out what her firm and insurance acceptances are going to be, I might be able to modify it, but whilst Aberdeen remains a possibility, I think I had better aim high!"},

{"title": "Fantastic bread", "date": "Saturday 11 January 2014", "text": "Thursday night, I read this blog post from Lucy at Attic24 and knew that I had to have a go at this bread. I could almost smell the delicious aroma through the internet - we really need smelly-vision these days!Yesterday morning, I copied down the recipe and had a batch of the dough in the airing cupboard by 8am.  It looked OK, nothing special, but it certainly wasn't a lot of work.When we came home from gym last night, and had had our tea, I brought the mixture down and it did look a little gloopy, as Lucy warned that it would.  But I duly heated up my oven and my casserole dish, turned the gloop out onto a floured piece of greaseproof paper, and shaped it.  That, I think, is one of the key aspects of the ease of this dough - I shaped it - I didn't knock all the air out of it and knead it and then have to leave it to prove again.  I could see large bubbles of air in the dough, and there they stayed. By just very gently shaping the dough, all that air is captured and preserved.I cooked it.  Wow.  It smelled lovely whilst we watched Silent Witness, and then it was tasting time!It sliced up well and shows off those large air bubbles.  The slow rise seems to give it a special something.Half the loaf disappeared in very short order as plates, knife and spread were brought in to facilitate munching for supper.  I suspect bread and jam were eagerly anticipated for breakfast this morning, and I have been told that I can certainly make that again!And for a bread with just four ingredients, and hardly any hands-on time at all, I think I could manage to make this part of our repertoire.  You just have to think ahead with regards to the time needed in the airing cupboard!  Still using the Co-op for the grocery shopping this week, to spend the £5 voucher I got for the previous lot of shopping, so I had to organise myself to do the shop yesterday, because that is the day I go to the town where the Co-op is, when I collect the YFG from school to go to gym......so it meant I couldn't buy anything chilled or frozen because it would be 5 hours before the shopping arrived home.No photos today, since I was in  a hurry to get the tea when we got in from gym, so you can have a wee list instead:3 loaves wholemeal bread, reduced to 73p each = £2.191.5kg Strong plain bread flour = £1.19Co-op Savers 500g grated cheese = £2.65Punnet plums = £1.50Large head of broccoli = £1.20Bag Chantenay carrots = 0.90Bag braeburn Apples = £2.00Savoy cabbage = £1.00One Courgette = 0.75Small punnet clementines = £2.50Two small bags potatoes = £2.50The grocery challenge part of the shop therefore comes to £18.38 but I wanted to make sure that I received another voucher for next week and was able to spend the one from the last shop, so I added two £1 shower gels to the basket, and made it over the £20 - £20.38.  This activated the voucher and I received £5 off this total, meaning I actually paid £15.38 for this week ahead's shopping.I shall have to buy some lunch meat for the girls' sandwiches, but I can do that and still come in under the £25 budget for the week.The items bought represent what I need to make the dinners on the meal plan until next Friday, as well as items for baking and some fruit for lunchboxes and snacking.  When we have eaten all the fresh veg, we will move over to the frozen stuff I have stashed in the freezer, and there is also tinned and frozen fruit, so just because I have not bought masses of fruit and veg does not mean that we won't be eating plenty!"},

[Couldn't find a picture of Co-op version so Aunt Bessie came to the rescue - the actual hash browns look very similar to hers but I should think hers are a bit pricier]  There were 18 in the pack, and each FG had three each morning for three mornings (2x3x3=18) and the pack cost me £1, so the 6 breakfasts cost around 15.6p each.  They had them served with a squirt of ketchup, and said that they were quite filling. Comparing meal costs is useful when trying to reduce spending.  Comparing one brand of cold cereal against another is not terribly useful when you realise that actually, cold cereal is overall an expensive breakfast.  A poached egg on toast could cost a lot less than a bowl of overpriced premium brand cereal, porridge is exceptionally good value, and these hash browns are not bad at this rate.Watching the numbers is a bit of a habit now![Edit to apologise for two pictures from Aunty B - Blogger is playing up a little and I can't get rid of one of them!]"},
{"title": "Welcome, friends", "date": "Thursday 9 January 2014", "text": "(image from temptationgifts.com)A quick post this evening to say that I have noticed a few more people dropping by lately, and some of you are even making the odd comment - it is lovely to have you here, and a very warm welcome to you all.  You will find us a gentle group of souls, I hope, and we look forward to hearing from you more in the days ahead.  I hope that 2014 will be a good year for us all.The January meal plan went up this morning and my next plan is to review the blogroll on the right hand side - I keep finding all these great blogs that I want to share with you all.But that is a job for tomorrow - I have to go and make cheese scones for the YFG's lunch box now!Have a great night/day, wherever you are xxTwo years ago, I took out my first mobile phone contract.  It saved me money compared to using a pay-as-you-go set up, and I capped the bill so that there were not going to be any surprises.  I got a shiny new phone into the bargain.  Remember, things are all relative, and so I was pleased that I was saving some cash, and I was also released from remembering to \"top-up\" every so often.Fast forward to this month, more specifically to yesterday, and it is time to think about the contract again, as it has come to the end of the specified 24 month period, and I am \"free\" to reconsider the arrangements.  The EFG also has a contract phone with a different carrier and we sorted hers out as well yesterday.(image from itidelhi.com)What a result for my purse!  Where I was spending £30.70 a month on the two phones, it is now going to cost me just £19.40 so I am annually £135.60 better off. What did we do?I told my carrier, Three, that I wasn't interested in a new phone, I just wanted the cheapest option possible based on my average usage.  After the chap got over himself trying to get me to have a new phone and really listened to what I was saying, and realised that I had actually found myself another option with a different carrier, he pulled the rabbit out of the hat at last and offered me 100 minutes of chatting time, with 5000 texts and 500MB of internet, for £6.90 a month.......what a difference!The EFG's phone has been upgraded, and she has a slightly more expensive contract than the one she was on, so hers has gone up to £12.50.  However, I did point out that there were plenty of satisfactory options available at £10 a month, which was her current plan, so that was all I was prepared to spend.  The compromise is that she is paying the other £2.50/month for the life of the contract.  And we have agreed that the next contract will be down to her to sort out and pay for - this is it for her!  Her new phone will be arriving in the next couple of days and then I will need to let the house insurance company know the new details, and we'll be set.  She's keeping her number too, and the FH can have her old phone with a PAYG SIM card in it.  I should think that a £10 voucher will keep him going for at least 6 months, or even longer - he's not a great chatterer on the phone and is completely oblivious to texts.So my savings in reality overall are a little bit more - actually £165.60 when the EFG's contribution is factored into the saving.  That means a little bit of leeway in my annual budget figures, which combined with my Skoda car tax coming in £5 cheaper than I had anticipated and the car insurance for the two car being quoted £80 less than my estimate, means that the annual budget is looking healthy......touch wood!"},
{"title": "Hardly comparable", "date": "Wednesday 8 January 2014", "text": "I've just been online and found this image of what the last lot of storms has wreaked on Aberystwyth.(image by Getty Images, from www.dailymail.co.uk)It hardly seems possible that this is the same street that we photographed in October on a clear blue-sky day as we were leaving.  Other photos on the DM website show those windows on the left of my photo now boarded up - I am presuming that debris thrown up by the storm must have smashed them.Just makes me think.Some frugal people don't garden.  Really?  Apparently so.  However, I think that even if I only grew cress or sprouted seeds in a tray, I would always grow something!  We are very lucky to have a big enough back garden to grow veggies and have a greenhouse, and we get the sun on it most of the day in the late spring, summer and early autumn. I have six veg beds, raised ones, as our soil is a heavy clay, compounded by the fact that the house builder scraped away the topsoil and didn't replace it when the development was complete....I could have words with him.  Anyway, we try not to walk on the beds, and I dig them over using an old scaffold board in the spring so that I don't compact the material any more than is necessary.  We add our own composted material, and we have plenty of that with the chickens and the rabbits.  The FH is always saying that the ground \"eats\" the material we put in, and he is right in that it all seems to sink down, but quite where it does go, I have no idea.I had a good rummage through our packets of seeds on Monday night, and it was interesting what I found.  First up, a packet of tomato seeds dated 1992 - can you believe that?!  20+ year old tomato seeds?  I don't think I will be trying those, especially since I have some that are much fresher.Our repertoire is fairly limited, but only to what we like to eat.  We don't grow stuff for other people so we have just ourselves to please.  I don't think I need to buy any seeds at all this year as we have plenty of everything:Runner beans, broad beans, climbing beans, dwarf beans [we like beans!], peas, tomatoes, squash & courgettes, radish, onions & spring onions, lettuces, kale, parsley, cucumber, chilli pepper and sweet pepper, beetroot, and landcress.  I will have to buy some seed potatoes, though.Years ago, the FH was the gardener, but now it is one of my roles, and I have the solid and dependable advice from UJ to keep me going in the right direction, as well as numerous books and websites too.I think that the pepper seeds have got to go in later this month, so I will have to get my act together soon!"},
{"title": "Challenge shop 1", "date": "Tuesday 7 January 2014", "text": "I was all set to go to that supermarket after we had been to the cinema yesterday but then, on the way there, we heard on the radio that the Co-op was offering a £5 voucher off a £20 shop each time you spent £20 and since £20 was about all I planned to spend today, it seemed like a good idea to call in at the Co-op on the way home to do the shop instead.  So I did.Here we have salad cream, two bottles of squash, and cold meat for sandwiches for the girls.And here there are large potatoes, apples, bananas, frozen beans and frozen broccoli, and two bags of frozen hash browns.  The hash browns were £1 a bag, and the girls asked for them as they had them each morning on the cruise for their breakfast - I think hash brown and fried egg was a favourite breakfast!  It would be Ok for them to have that occasionally, as the chooks are just beginning to think about laying now, so I have had about 5 eggs this last week from them!So I have spent the grand sum of £18.85 so far this week.My apologies that the menu page isn't up yet: it is on my to-do list for today now that the girls are off to school again.......there may be slightly more time for me.Yesterday's trip to the cinema was good, and I really enjoyed \"Saving Mr Banks\" which is about PL Travers and Walt Disney as they \"discussed\" making the film of Mary Poppins.  I had a tear in my eye quite often through the film, and it is one of the films that I would consider buying on DVD as I think I could watch it again and again.  I'd highly recommend it if you haven't seen it - Emma Thompson is very good in it and I think she is a very fine actress.  And it was all the better for not having to pay for my tickets - thanks to that supermarket's voucher system!"},
{"title": "Grocery challenges in January", "date": "Monday 6 January 2014", "text": "To get January off to a good start with the savings, I am challenging myself to spend no more than £25 on groceries for the four of us this week.  That is less than half what we seem to spend most weeks, on average.  I did this a few years ago when we wanted to buy the wood burner and then again when we bought the Skoda Fabia, so I know that we can do it, although prices may have gone up slightly since then. The basic premise is that we use what we have got, and only spend money to round out or finish off the meals.  I know that I am likely to have to buy some cold meat for sandwiches for the girls' school lunches, but I am also entirely confident that we do not need 101 other things - like milk, flour, sugar, meat, pasta, rice, tuna, jam, etc.  The storecupboards are brimming and with the month's menu plan to hand, I know that I just need to buy fresh carrots, baking potatoes, apples and oranges, for example, so far this week. Orange squash will also be on the list.  I shall post our menu plan on a separate page at the top, and then I shall also post the shopping with pictures as I buy it so you can see how we get on.  As usual, enlisting the support of the family is helpful.  Today will be the first shopping trip as we are going to the cinema this afternoon on our Clubcard voucher Cineworld tokens: the EFG and I are going to see Saving Mr Banks, and then the YFG and her friend are going to see The Hobbit.  Since the Cineworld cinema is very close to one of THOSE supermarkets, I am going there today....saves wasting diesel making a trip to one of the more preferred outlets.You will notice a good deal of repetition in the menu plan - there is nothing wrong with that, in my opinion.  Tuesday is baked potato night because I am at gym with the EFG and it is easy for the FH to bung the potatoes in the oven for me whilst I am out.  Fridays are either a very quick dish, or one that I can cook earlier in the day and then \"ding\" in the microwave when we get home from gym again."},
{"title": "Getting organised", "date": "Sunday 5 January 2014", "text": "I do love the freshness of the New Year - new plans and \"revolutions\" [YFG today!] afoot, and the chance to start again at something, at everything! I have made myself another household planner, using a discarded lever arch file that the EFG was no longer using, and some pages I have printed off from the internet.  A calendar page for each month, a seasonal picture front cover page for each month, 12 \"what have I spent?\" pages to help me to track where the money goes, and a nice set of dividers from the stationery stash, and I am all set in there.  All the letters about hospital appointments are now filed in the appropriate month, so we remember to go, and know where to go, and dates are on the calendar pages.  All our income is on the calendar too, that I know of, so that I know roughly when we have money coming in.   There is also a list of Direct Debits in the front cover so that I know what is going out and when, more to the point.  I have updated our contacts lists, and it is all looking good.  I do need to add a family weigh-in chart for the three eldest of us as we do need to track our weight.  I shall do that in a minute.... All it has cost me is my time and some ink and paper.  Not bad, and very personal for me and for us as a family.I have also found and printed off a Bible reading plan from the internet so that is pasted into a notebook, and I am taking pleasure in reading according to the plan and then ticking off each chapter or set of chapters as they are read.  Some things are coming together at last!Excel spreadsheets are my favourite way to track our savings and where it all is.  Our savings are distributed across several institutions so it helps me to see what is where, and I have to say that I also track the points I am earning on the websites and schemes I told you about yesterday.  This spreadsheet lives on my desktop on the computer, but it is password protected for privacy.  Updating it every Monday helps me to see where we are going and to give me an inspirational boost for the week ahead, or a bit of a motivational boot if it isn't going so well.  Some months don't go particularly well, and then others make up for it all.    I shall set up the 2014 spreadsheet tonight so that it is ready for the morning.Monday morning is monitoring time here.  I check with all the banking and see what's what, and then I read the electricity meter to see how our usage has been over the past week: I submit the reading online which also means that the electricity company is bang up to date with what we are using.  Occasionally I have seen that the monthly payment needs to be adjusted and I can get in touch and ask them to alter it so that we don't build up a debt, if we seem to be using more or if the prices have been hiked.  We are on a fixed price tariff at the moment, but when we changed at the end of our previous deal, we had to increase the monthly payment because the price had gone up.I also like to know what is happening in the week ahead, so Monday is also a good time for me to look at the planner and diary and make sure they match, and then to chat with the FH about where we have to go or what I have to do, if I have meetings.  The menu plan is a huge help now that I have started to be more organised with it. The menu plan works around what I have in the cupboards and freezer first and then I shop to supplement what I have already.  I have looked around the stores and planned the menu for the whole of January this time, so that we can work ahead and freeze some main meals to save time and energy too.  I know that I have to buy some fresh produce like veg and fruit, but I shouldn't need rice, pasta, meat, sauces, baking goods, etc or any toiletry items either this month - unless I see a sale on Nouvelle toilet rolls!"},
{"title": "Making a bit extra", "date": "Saturday 4 January 2014", "text": "During this past year, I have had some sidelines going on to make a few extra pennies over the course of the year, and they are all things that you could do too.  None is complicated, and they all work....to a degree.  I am not going to make my fortune at any of them, but they all contribute to the family funds in one way or another.Every time I shop, I scan my shopping with a tiny hand-held laser barcode scanner, and then I upload them to a website, along with scans of my receipts.  I have earned vouchers this year from Amazon, although it has been my choice to take the rewards as Amazon vouchers.  Each week that I upload my shopping barcodes, I receive 1100 points, and each week that I upload the receipts, I get an extra 500 points.  Some weeks, like those over Christmas, they have trebled the basic 1100 points in recognition of how busy folk are at this time of year, so I have benefited from the extra points.  I have also answered a few surveys this year and been rewarded for those from the same organisation.  Since I got a bonus amount of points when I joined, I have earned at least £100 of rewards from here to spend at Amazon this year.  I used £50 towards the YFG's birthday tablet that she had, and the EFG has had £20 of vouchers too, as well as spending some on books I wanted.  I still have £20 \"in the bank\" there to claim.  If you are interested, you can fill in an online application here.  There is information about the Shop and Scan scheme here.  [Just so you know, neither of those links are affiliate links and I don't get a referral fee.]I still do surveys for YouGov and after a £50 pay out in 2013, I am still creeping my way back towards another pay out.  I suspect it may be 2015 before that comes to fruition though, as I don't always have time to do them as they appear!Quidco and TopCashBack are also excellent places to make a few pounds here and there.  I always go to The Book People through Quidco when I want any books from there, and there are also deals to be had on car insurance and household insurance.  We always try them, but they aren't the cheapest every time, we have found, even with the cashback.  Definitely worth a look though. We also had a grand clear out of old DVDs a couple of Christmases ago and sent a box full of them to Music magpie, which brought us just over the £50 minimum payment that they offer.  It was a bit of a slog to enter all the barcodes, but it was worth it in the end.The key to all of these schemes is that none of them pay out much, but they all fit into our lives quite easily, without much bother [it is no hassle to zap the shopping as we are putting it away] and the rewards accrue over time, so when I check the account at Shop and Scan for example and see that I could claim another £10 voucher, it is a little boost!  It also means that the gift budget can be less stretched!"},
{"title": "You can't win them all", "date": "Friday 3 January 2014", "text": "I realised this afternoon that the girls are very much a work in progress for me.  The EFG went out with her friend shopping yesterday to Cambridge, far to the south, and then the YFG went with a whole bunch of girls to Peterborough today, across the Fens. Both of them came home with some bargains, but the EFG definitely scored higher on the frugal front! She bought three dresses from one shop, for the grand sum of £13, all from the sale rail.  The YFG bought herself some shoes which were not reduced at all, a DVD at half price but still £6.99, a half price jumper at £10 and some \"Lush\" bath bomby stuff, which I hate because it makes the bath a pain to clean!  Where the YFG does score is on the generosity front: one of her friends lost her shopping [several books] during the course of the day and was devastated when she realised, so the group all chipped in and bought her some new copies.  That was kind, I thought.However, on a positively frugal note, both of them have put half of their Christmas money into their savings accounts, and only took the other half out with them.  Needless to say, the EFG brought more home that the YFG. Experience will tell, in the end, I hope, and the EFG will be adding to her bank roll this weekend with another babysitting job tomorrow evening.My own shopping for the day has been limited to some bargain balls of wool in a local shop as I saw the offers advertised as I took the YFG to the station this morning.  I popped in afterwards and bought four balls of wool, in my favourite shade, which are enough to make two scarves or 8 hats, so that will be enough to keep my needles clacking for months to come, when I have any spare time for knitting.Our thoughts go out tonight to all the folk on the west coast of the country in particular, battered as they are in the storms today and tonight.  We think in particular of the people of Aberystwyth as we saw the very hotel we stayed in in October being lashed by the waves, but I spent a very happy week in Perranporth as a teenager and it was very shocking to see the height of the waves crashing over the front there tonight as well.Good night, all - keep safe and warm and dry, wherever you are."},
{"title": "Thoughts for today", "date": "Thursday 2 January 2014", "text": "Rabbitquilter made a good point in her comments that I seem to have posted a long list of things to do or change in 2014, and yet a little while ago, I was talking about slowing down.  She's absolutely right.The difference is that I have changed the focus.  A lot of the things in the list are about me for a change, things for me, personally.  There's nothing in there about knitting madly as I did in 2013 to send woolly hats to Romania, or busting a gut teaching after school gym clubs three times a week in local schools. I have slowed down a lot, and recognised that day to day, I have sometimes enough of a challenge just to get through the day with the FH and his pain and problems, dealing with the taxi-service that is my dedication to the girls, and just keeping going with the things I want to do in the village, like the cookbook for the chapel.  I think I have hinted yesterday that I might want to stop doing some things, and some people may not like that, as I have made myself a reliable part of the organisations, but whilst I have been reliable, that does not make me irreplaceable.Our financial goals are also about the family.  Every penny we manage to save and squirrel away now is a buffer for the future, when we don't quite know what will happen.  I am buying my family time in the future to think, to pray and to make measured decisions. Pushing myself too hard is not on the agenda this year at all.  I want to make my life a little smaller, a little less stretched, and a lot more focused on God and family.  This blog is an extension of that, in that I have found a huge network of supportive folk out there on whom I can rely for advice and wisdom, courage and support, and you all deserve to be cherished.  Thank you."},
{"title": "Looking forward", "date": "Wednesday 1 January 2014", "text": "I have given quite a lot of thought over the past couple of weeks to the things I want to change or improve for 2014.  Some things are pootling along quite well and can be left to continue, but other things could do with a kick up the you-know-where to make lives easier or better in one way or another.So in 2014, I want to do some things:I want to read the whole Bible throughI haven't ever done this, and I am sure that there are huge chunks of the Bible that I have never read at all.  Since I started Faith & Worship, I have read more and more, but this would be one way of making sure I had read it all at least once.  I've been looking online for some plans, and found a couple.  Today I am starting with Genesis, and I'll decide on the plan to follow tomorrow!I intend to finish Faith and Worship this yearThis course is long and challenging, and I need to see the end in sight.  The reality is that if I set my mind to it and just DID it, I could finish it this year.  So I will.  You read it here!I want to memorise more scriptureI failed abysmally at Ann Voskamp's plan to memorise chapters of Matthew last year, so I am excited to find out her plans for this year, and to have another go.I want to be more diligent at writing here every dayI have been better at this in the later months of the year, but earlier on it was a little sporadic at times.Five days out of seven need to include exerciseMy bum has got bigger again and so...I need to lose a stoneThat's quite simple: eat better food, move more.  Just need to do it.  Jeans are getting tight...I need to help the EFG to be ready to \"leave home\" in SeptemberI am not entirely sure what that entails, but I think that some financial education, some cookery advice and some washing-her-own-clothes instructions would be a good start.....oh, and how to clean the loo!LincolnI've got a sealed pot savings tin againAnd I am going to use it - already am!  I have no clear idea of what I will use it for, but the pot is there, and I shall continue to put odds and ends in it, and the egg money will go into it as well, when the chooks get round to laying me some eggs again.  Roll on, Valentine's Day!Savings target for this year is £5K: we will have £5K more than we do today at the end of the year.Revised down from this last year's target and achievement, but in recognition of some expenses coming up as I said, and also of a probable reduction in income.Consideration of our spending habitsI'm veering more towards the German supermarkets, the Co-op and Approved Foods at the moment, and since we have stocks of most things, I think I have a while to have a ponder over this one.  We have limited shopping in the village, and to use a butcher, a baker and a market, I'd have to go to town to the same place as the supermarkets, so it wouldn't be a major problem.  I definitely want to get back to more basic foods as I feel that we have been relying on things out of packets a little too much in 2013, mostly down to lack of time. (image from en.wikipedia.org)We started to declutter and it felt very liberatingso now we just need to carry on and do more, and more, and more!  But our lives could also do with some streamlining as I feel that I am becoming stretched out too much.  It is really hard to say to someone that you want to do less, so the temptation is to either carry on, or to tell them that you are leaving altogether......People find it hard to understand, and I have to find a way through this by the end of 2014, if not before.I want to cook from scratch every day!The YFG has developed a taste for chicken kievs - aargh!  She's going to have to taste home made ones soon, and eat more vegetables!  Seriously, the kitchen is the heart of this home and we need to make sure that we are eating the right foods for all of us to thrive.  2013 has been a very hard year in many ways, and so coming back to basics with food is going to be a good way to S L O W down and re-focus, I hope!The garden needs more attention and then it will produce more!  We didn't have a bad year in the veg beds, but we could have had a better one....if I had got off to an earlier start.  The time I should have begun in earnest collided with the FH being ill, so I was sidetracked, but with the help of my gardening guru, UJ, all was not lost.  This year, I want to think about some permanent beds for fruit bushes like the gooseberry blue berry as well as the raspberries and strawberries we already have.  The fruit trees look like they have all died, so we need to do something about those too.I want to get the fundraising cookbook for the chapel written this yearI have been talking about this for about 3 years now, so this would be a good year to actually DO it, wouldn't it?!?I'm off for a look around the other blogs now to see what you are all planning for 2014.  I think it is going to be an exciting year all round.The latest jigsaw - finished last night.If I wanted to, I could put a frugal angle on a jigsaw - I could say that they are a good way of spending time which doesn't cost a lot, and that whilst the FH is sitting doing them, he isn't out doing anything that costs money!  We also have a free local supply in that there are ladies at chapel who share their jigs with one another and have offered the FH a lifetime's supply!However, I'm actually just using my blog as a place to record our lives, and for today, I want to keep a picture of this beautiful puzzle, taken by the YFG before it is broken up and lent out to someone else to enjoy.  It is a little bit of a shame that you can't see the line of ducklings which follow their mum right at the bottom of the picture - they are very cute!"},
{"title": "Shopping the sales", "date": "Tuesday 31 December 2013", "text": "(image from telegraph.co.uk)We got up really early, keen as mustard, the girls and I, and we headed off into the nearest big city, Peterborough, for some sale shopping this morning.  We didn't really need anything, but we thought we would have a day out together and see what we could find in the sales.  The car park was a nightmare, and the shops were heaving with other people, desperate to spend, spend, spend.  By lunchtime, we had a couple of bags each, and were getting weary, so we headed back to the car to leave those things before we went to buy some lunch.  The cafes and tea shops were also doing a roaring trade today, and it wasn't easy to get a table............You don't really believe that, do you?!  You know me better than that!  That little scenario would be my worst nightmare!!The only sale shopping I have done today was to walk around Lidl and pick up a tray of 12 cartons of skimmed milk because they were all on offer at 40-something pence per litre, so I stocked up!  The other kind of sale shopping is something we definitely do not do!Looking at our spending for the last year, it has been easy to see where we have spent more than we budgeted: clothes shopping went hugely over budget, but that was largely down to the holiday that the girls had, and their need for the kind of clothes they don't usually wear!  The food budget was also bust, so that needs some looking at for the year ahead.  It wasn't mad, but we could do better, I know.Fuel continues to be an expensive commodity and with the FH's failing health, it is costing us more to keep warm since he needs the house to be a little warmer, and the supply of free wood which he used to scrounge is harder for me to access and deal with now that he is no longer able to do it.  The price of oil has gone up, and where I budgeted £650 last year, I actually spent closer to £850, and I can see that that will only keep rising.  The house is a new-build so insulation is already installed and there is little that I can do to improve the efficiency of the building itself.  We have hot water bottles, rugs, thick jumpers, etc, so we have done all that we can in that respect too. We may be approaching the time at which getting rid of the FH's car is a good option, as I can't see the need for it much longer.  He has found driving increasingly difficult since he had the bad attack of gout in his wrist and that may be a very sensible economy.  My car has also had a very expensive year, costing me a substantial amount in repairs, so I hope that it has a better year this year!The girls had their holiday with their Grandad and then we had a few days in Norfolk - this is not going to happen again as my sister and my uncle decided not to renew the agreement and have let the caravan go.  We can't blame them as it was a huge financial commitment, but it does mean we will miss the woods and walks there!  There may not be a holiday in 2014....My earning potential continues to decline in proportion to the FH's health, and so I am beginning to wonder about having to give up altogether - it is difficult to get the school to take me on to run after school club gym if I am going to have to abandon the course part way through like I did last February when the FH was very ill.  I have only done one 8 week course since then, and I am reluctant to book another one in for the Spring as that is when his health has been at its worst.And how did we do overall in 2013?  I didn't achieve the £9K improvement in our finances that I was hoping to get, but I did manage £7K, so I am very pleased with that.  Looking at the figures for the coming year, I may have to set my sights even lower this year, which is a little disappointing.  But there are things we need for the house which will have to be bought this year, not least a new oven, a new bath panel, a new shower enclosure and possibly some paint.......The shower enclosure is a health issue as the FH struggles with the shower as it is, and we have talked about replacing it before, but not done so.  Now that he is struggling with the bath as well, he is going to have to make more use of the shower, and so it has become a priority.  I can't have many more minor tsunamis like we had this weekend when he fell into the bath with rather a wallop.......Tomorrow I shall think about some ideas for moving forward with a more positive flavour, because tonight I feel like I am wallowing in the difficulties a little - sorry, folks!

{"title": "Looking back", "date": "Monday 30 December 2013", "text": "What a year we have had in so many ways........I am getting to the point now that I am looking forward to 2014 so that we can start afresh, although we will be taking lessons and some health issues forward into the new year.January was not a great start to the year, with the FH spending most of the month in bed, suffering from a debilitating chest infection, that then took him to hospital in February, when we discovered that his kidneys were failing somewhat.  We started the year with a Low Spend Challenge, and ate mostly from the storecupboards and freezers.We seemed to spend the early months of the year at hospital in one way or another, either visiting him or taking him to appointments.  Even when he came out of hospital, he still wasn't properly well, and struggled through March.  April saw him back in for a shorter stay, but a much more successful one, with new medications and a much fitter FH came out again.I knitted loads of these hats this year too!May was time for a challenge and we spent the whole month avoiding that supermarket you all know I am not terribly keen on!  We were pleased with the challenge, and people seemed interested in how it all went.  It was also the month we hatched some cheepy chicks out and loved seeing them grow.June saw my favourite challenge of the year when I learned to crochet.  I loved it when I got going, and some kind ladies of the Craft Club at chapel saw me on the right road, holding the hook and getting the tension under control.  I shall get back to crochet soon...June was also the month I had to face up to the EFG going to university in 2014 and we started some uni visits, going to Lincoln and UEA.  UJ's help in the garden meant that things were underway and growing better than the year before!Brayford Pool at LincolnJuly was a month of heat and thunderstorms, when we got struck by lightening and lost all our phone and internet connection - it was weird to lose such communications like that, and we felt a bit lonely! July was a patriotic time as we saw Prince George of Cambridge presented to the world too.  The FH had one more night in hospital that was a bit of a mystery and he was discharged the next day with no real diagnosis.One of the EFG's beautiful photos from the tripAugust was quite a month.  We had some local days out, our beloved Lancelot died, and the girls went on the cruise to Norway with my dad and MB.  We really missed them, but they had an amazing time. The exam results also arrived, and big smiles on the girls' faces said it all.Lancelot 2007/8 - 2013September and October was the most challenging time of the year so far.  It started off quite gently with a short break in Norfolk and ended with a heartbreaking tangle over a newborn baby that was never meant to be part of our family, it seemed.  It took some time to move on from all of that, and really wreaked havoc with people's emotions.  The EFG and I also made our roadtrip to Aberystwyth, quite an adventure, and some valuable time together as well. The prom at AberystwythNovember had us losing communications again through a damaged cable in the road somewhere, so once that was replaced, we were back again!  It was a month of preparations, of thinking and making plans, of beginning to bring plans together for the festive period, and a time to think, for me.  It was also  a very rough time in the weather, and the garden continues to be saturated.....some things don't change.December had the FH back in hospital for one night with a chest infection that presented our doctor with a couple of mysterious symptoms, so he sent us off to the hospital again.  Thankfully the antibiotics have improved his health no end since the beginning of the month, and his only problem now is the gout. My own Dad has been the major worry this Christmas time with his hospitalisation, and now his continuing recovery period.  Fingers and toes are crossed for him across the world as friends on this blog and on FB remember him and he is thought of in prayers too.  He'd be a bit gobsmacked about that all, actually, so I haven't told him! The recent storms that have battered the country really make us think about other people and count our blessings whilst we wonder what we can do to help.I shall be thinking about our plans for 2014 tonight, and be back with a looking-forward post tomorrow x"},

I saw a walking frame by the side of the bed the last couple of times we visited but he says that he hasn't been using it because he has had nowhere to go...I am cautiously optimistic this morning, and really hoping that he will feel much better after this.  I will broach the subject of his next cruise and whether he should be going on it, when I see how he does over the weekend, and whether we can get a chat with a doctor about it.  Gadding off to the Western Med on the 27th January may not be the wisest plan in the circumstances.  It's got to be about pacing himself [and yes, pun intended, sorry!] over the next wee while and rebuilding his strength."},

{"title": "Not out of the woods yet", "date": "Tuesday 24 December 2013", "text": "The EFG and I had a good hour with my Dad this afternoon, although the YFG had to spend the time patiently in the relatives' room as she has developed a cold.  When we arrived, Dad was asleep, but soon perked up when he realised we were there.He looks tired, and I guess that it isn't the best place for a restful night's sleep, so I can understand that, and he seems to grab what sleep he can get!Remembering that he went in because his heart rate had plummeted last Wednesday, we have looked at the monitor each time we visit, and it has shown anything from 40 - 60 bpm, still a little low, but they seemed to have it under control.  Today when we walked in, it showed 113, and it varied over the hour, setting off the alarm three times by spiking over 200 and reaching 227 at the highest I saw it.  Two doctors and two nurses came over each time, and they had a discussion about medication, and said that he will be resuming a pill that they had stopped!  His pacemaker insertion is now booked for Friday, so we have to hope and pray that he stays stable enough to have it done this time. The FH's son has been invited over for the holiday but he isn't coming.  I hoped that he had other invitations, but today I heard from him again and he says that he hopes to work, to keep his mind occupied.  I'm upset that that means he will be alone in a chilly carpenter's workshop, building sheds, but I can see what he means, I think.  We have some gifts for him, so we will arrange to see him another time, soon.  He's in our thoughts a lot at the moment - he works until he is exhausted and then he sleeps, and then he works.  It is very hard.As far as Christmas goes, we are as ready as we will be this year, and I still haven't got the marzipan and icing on the cakes....they may not get them this year!  People who like fruit cake like fruit cake, surely!We have had a lovely meal together here tonight, I have watched Last Tango in Halifax, and the rest of the gang are watching something else now, and I am going to potter in the kitchen for a while before heading off to bed with a book.  Chapel is not until 10.30am in the morning, so I can have a short lie in before I get up to see to the chooks.Merry Christmas, everybody - love and best wishes for a peaceful Christmas!"},

{"title": "A quiet day at home", "date": "Sunday 22 December 2013", "text": "The FH and I went to church this morning, where I was taking the service, and I re-did a service I used a couple of weeks ago elsewhere - the one with Rahab, the scarlet ribbon and the genealogy paper chains.  Just as before, it went down very well, thank goodness!  We had a full house, for us, with most of the regular attendees there and even a couple of extras.Once we came home from that, we spent the day quietly.  We haven't had the tv on much, and even forgot to watch the Ten Top Carols from the Songs of Praise team, remembering just at the last moment so that we only saw Michael Ball sing the last one.  The FH has been doing a jigsaw puzzle nearly all day, and I have pottered about - a little bit of this and some of that, helping him now and again, making some calls to MB and to the FH's sister, sending some text messages to the FH's son, and to my friend T.We've plodded and pottered through the day.  We have had a really good supper of chicken thighs cooked in vegetable stock with sweet potatoes, served with roasties, cabbage, carrots and sprouts.  It is probably the most nutritious meal we have had all week and it tasted great.  I think it will do us good!The news from the hospital is OK.  Dad has had a bad night, but only because a youngish woman has been brought into the bed next to him, and the team were busy working on her through the night, and it seems that she must have been in quite some pain from the noise that was going on.  MB visited Dad this morning, but left him to have his lunch and then he planned to sleep this afternoon if he could.  She reports that in himself, he is in good spirits, but just tired.  We will visit tomorrow at some point in the afternoon or evening when I have co-ordinated with my sister.  It suits MB to be there in the mornings, which is fine with us. And so to this evening....the FH continues with his puzzle, the girls are upstairs enjoying another game of Monopoly, and the tv is on in the background so that the FH can listen to Countryfile, which he enjoys.  I think it will probably be turned off afterwards.  We have delivered all the cards and gifts we want to give, and we are ready to settle down now in our own space.  The only place we need to go now is the hospital over the next few days, and we will be having Boxing Day off from that because we have cousins coming to visit us, but otherwise we shall be there most days.I have borrowed a book from the bookshelf in the relatives' room at the hospital so I am planning to read that and return it in the next few days, but I have also found some more of my own to take to supplement their selection, and I shall raid my stash of older magazines to find a few to take and leave, since those in the room are all of the celebrity kind, which I find tedious, 'cos I don't know who half the people in them are!!Best wishes to all of you, and fondest hopes for a peaceful Christmas for everyone x"},
{"title": "Health update", "date": "Saturday 21 December 2013", "text": "Oh my word, what a couple of days we have had!  I was at the hospital on Wednesday afternoon when Dad first went in, and he was poorly but quite sensible.  We chattered on about his brothers, one who was in the RAF but died years ago, and the other who is slightly younger than Dad but is now suffering with dementia.  We also talked about my girls, and he was pleased to see me.On Thursday, I was planning to go over in the late afternoon/early evening, when the girls were home from school; at about 2pm I got a call to say that he was being transferred to Papworth for the pacemaker operation to be performed at 3pm, and that the ambulance was on its way to transfer him.  We thought about it and were dithering as to whether to visit him at Papworth so soon after the op, and had sort of resigned ourselves to waiting for the next day so that he had had a while to recover from that.  I phoned my sister, who was planning to visit in the afternoon, to tell her about the developments.All was calm!Then it wasn't: at 2.55pm, a call came in on my mobile from my Dad's mobile, so I knew it had to be his partner, MB.  She started to talk and then began to cry, so a nurse came on the line, and said that Dad hadn't been transferred, that he had become very poorly and that we needed to go in. \"Turn for the worse\" were the words she used.  I had to make some calls quickly: cancelled a 3.30pm meeting at school, rang my sister back and told her to get over there, rang the girls' school and asked them to get the girls to the reception area for me quickly, and we left.We arrived at the hospital to find that he had been very sick and had had to have some quite fast treatment to clear his airways but that some of the vomit had got into his lungs and has resulted now in a chest infection.  He knew us, but he was really imagining and seeing all sorts of things, including people long dead.  He was convinced he had been to buy a turkey that morning, and sent me out on a delivery!  The FH brought the girls home, and I stayed there with MB and my sister.  MB lasted until about 6pm, and then had to go home exhausted.  Our half-sister arrived to see him at about 8.30pm, and my sister and I left at 9pm. After that, apparently he became very agitated and kept trying to get out of the bed, so the staff gave him a sleeping pill and they tell us that he slept all night.  That was the making of him, because when I went yesterday, he is himself again - quite sensible and able to have a good conversation with us.  We gave him the Norway calendar yesterday so that he could talk with the girls about it, and he has enjoyed looking at it with them.  MB has seen it this morning and is also thrilled with it.  We asked him how much of the previous day he remembered and he said that he really didn't recall much of it at all, and laughed when I told him about the errand he had sent me on.Last night, when we got home and after we had eaten, I was really tired so I had a thimbleful of sloe gin and a hot bath, and collapsed into my bed just before 10pm and slept round the clock till the phone rang at 9am!  I really needed the sleep and feel much better today.MB has been in to see him this morning and reports that John is back!  He is hoping that a tv can be found so that he will be able to watch the football results this afternoon, so that is an extremely good sign!  She has had a good morning with him, and is very relieved to see him so himself again.  My sister is visiting this afternoon, and we are going tonight with UJ.The nurse we spoke with yesterday said that at that point, the pacemaker procedure is still on the cards, but not until the infection has cleared up.  I need to clarify today whether he has a kidney infection as well, as we all seem to think that he might have, but the staff have only talked vaguely about an \"infection\" and we know that there is the chest problem from inhaling the vomit but wonder whether there is more to it than that.Sorry that my usual frugal thoughts have been replaced with more of a medical drama casebook these past few weeks, but this blog is an accurate reflection of the journey we are on here in the Fens, and this is what is happening to us now.  As I said to the FH and the girls last night, we have food in the cupboards and the freezer, there are some presents under the tree and we have plenty of wood for the fire, and everything else material doesn't really matter.  We need to spend time together as a family, and we need to spend time with my Dad, so that is our focus for this Christmas now whatever the days ahead bring.  The church service for tomorrow morning was readied earlier in the week and for that I am grateful!"},

He was having some worrying symptoms so his partner, MB, called an ambulance.  The paramedics did some ECGs and worked out that his heart was not beating as fast as it should have been, and took him off to the local hospital.  A smaller one than the one that the FH usually attends.I got over there this afternoon, and he is all wired up in a critical care unit, with a super-dooper electronic bed with an air mattress on it.  He wasn't looking terribly perky, and had a couple of drips in his arm, but his heart rate is stabilising, and they are hoping to transfer him over to Papworth hospital for a pacemaker to be fitted soon.Somehow he thinks he might still make it over here for lunch on Sunday, but I did say that that could wait and we could do it when he is feeling stronger! The girls were planning to give him his Christmas present on Sunday so I did say that wherever he is, I will try to take them over to see him - they have had a calendar made from the Norway photos for him [I think I told you that!] and they are quite excited to see what he thinks to it.There are just two weeks left of this year, so I am hoping that this is the final thing of the year, and that somehow 2014 might be more restful, more peaceful, more stable.  Somehow, I won't be holding my breath!My challenge of the week is the staff Christmas gifts at school.  I had thought that I would just do fudge again this year, then I decided to do something else......then the girls got me some of the cellophane gift bags for packaging from Lakeland, and when they got them home, there were only 20 in the bag - I am sure there used to be more than that!  Anyway, whatever I do for the staff, I need to do 22.  I need to DO the thing tomorrow in order to take them into school on Friday morning.  The EFG has made some fabby reindeer biscuits tonight, but there aren't 22 of them the same.........wail!  If I make fudge or the mock Ferrero Rocher chocs, I also need to make little trays to set them in, and 22 of them is no mean feat...why did we take on extra TAs at school this year?!  I am sorely tempted to fling the reindeer biccies onto a big tray and put them in the staffroom with a Help Yourself and Happy Christmas sign on them and leave it at that......what do you reckon?  Anyone got any bright ideas for something small and delicious that I can do tomorrow, which isn't cakey?  Hint: tell me the reindeer will do!Just read on MSE that there is an Aldi voucher in the Sun today - usual deal and valid up to and including Christmas Eve......I won't be getting this one as I haven't used last week's yet!  Hope it helps someone, though.(image from ksh.wikipedia.org)"},

We are so glad that the end of term is on Friday - we caught the YFG sleepwalking on the landing last night and I can only think that it was because she was so tired this week with the end of term and the excitement of Christmas!  I am definitely enjoying a slower week without the pressure of the gymnastics.  The FH has done a whole puzzle today, and is pleased with the accomplishment, and he walked to the other end of the street to see his friend, a chap of 80+.  They had a natter and he was home for lunch."},

Perhaps you won't!I was woken at 6am this morning by the sound of the EFG gasping for breath.  She had made it into the bathroom and her coughing and gasping had also woken the YFG who was there with her.  She could not get her breath at all and was trying to gulp in air, making terribly desperate noises.  It was agonising to watch and not be able to do much to help her.  This is not the first time that this has happened, but it is the first time that it has happened in her sleep, and driven her from her bed.  She remembers nothing until the point at which I appeared in the bathroom to be with her.  It happened to the YFG once a couple of weeks ago when I found her at 2am gasping for breath, sitting on the landing.  Thankfully, she has not had any further big episodes.  I am certain now that the coughs they have had for ages have contributed to this somehow.When we saw the doctor on Friday, we tried to explain what was happening in these episodes, but she clearly didn't understand the severity of the happenings, and we came away with a prescription but very little in the way of help for this.Frightened and alarmed by what happened this morning, I turned to the internet when I got up at 7am.  I had spent an hour perched on the end of the EFG's bed whilst she tried to get some more sleep, but it wasn't very restful.  Googling \"Choking on air\" I came up with this website where I was relieved in a way to read that lots of other people know what she is going through.  The forum makes several suggestions which might help in the short term, but now that we have a way to describe more accurately what is happening to her, we will be going back to the doctor this week.  If it happens again and I have the presence of mind, the EFG has said she will not mind if I video it on my phone so that we can actually show the doctor what happens in an episode, since on examination in the surgery, she is unlikely to be showing any signs.I am off now to make a chart to put up on the landing and in her bedroom with the suggestions on it, because I doubt any of us will be able to remember them when all we desperately want is for her to be able to take a breath.  I am somewhat reassured by reading that the worst that would happen is that she would pass out, at which point her larynx would relax and she would be able to breathe again, but I really don't want that to happen.  Trials and tribulations, eh?!  I am wearing my knees out."},

We got home from that to find that the YFG had done all the ironing and washed my car, so she has earned herself a little pocket money to go shopping on tomorrow, as the EFG has a babysitting job tonight and will be earning hers in a less energetic manner - I have had a text from her and she is watching tv with a pug asleep on her lap - sounds like hard work!I have to say that I have done very little apart from make supper and wash up afterwards this evening.  I have watched a little of The Bible on Channel 5, but missed the start of it.  A rest is always a good thing, and I am waiting for a phone call from the EFG for a lift home, so I can't go to bed yet!Hope you are all having a good weekend with friends or family xxxToday marks the beginning of my real countdown to Christmas as we do the last gym session of the term today, and I free up more of my time for other things!This week ahead just has school and church responsibilities to think about, and I can spend some more time on home and family - cleaning up for Christmas and getting some more decorations up, writing that Christmas letter and sending out some photos to the older relatives, catching up on the laundry so we don't have airers everywhere over the holiday, and generally getting in the mood for the celebrations!I'm off to wake up the FH to start on the morning medication routine, and get the YFG up to come to gym with me.  The chooks are waiting for their breakfast too, and I'm off - see you later - have a good day x"},

{"title": "Another Aldi voucher", "date": "Thursday 12 December 2013", "text": "Yes, yet another Aldi voucher in the papers today - in the Mirror in England and Wales and the Record in Scotland.  £5 off when you spend £40, worth having if you are an Aldi fan.  I prefer the Mirror package to the one I got last week in the Express, as the Mirror vouchers tend to last a full week rather than just until Wednesday and somehow that extra day towards the weekend does make a difference.  The Mirror has also been in the habit of giving other supplementary vouchers for particular items - I got a posh tin of Fox's biscuits which I wanted to give as a family gift to some friends last time for £2.79 which I then saw selling for £5 in one of the big four supermarkets.(image from ksh.wikipedia.org)We were only in Aldi on Monday so the chances are that I will get this voucher and not actually go to spend it until towards the end of next week.  This run of vouchers is as good as the Morrison's offer really, I think, as the week's minimum spend is only £40 which is very do-able for a family of four like us, although I appreciate that a frugal couple may well spend a lot less each week.  I accept that I am having to buy the paper, but I am still £4.50 better off, and it is helping me to stay out of certain other supermarkets, too!"},
{"title": "Cutting the cost of Christmas", "date": "Tuesday 10 December 2013", "text": "Lighting the fire this morning, I came across an article in the Daily Express that I bought last week for the Aldi voucher.  The article is entitled, \"20 ways to cut the cost of Christmas\" so I thought I would share their words of wisdom with you, and give you my opinion on the ideas....take it or leave it!1. JOIN FORCES - their idea is to get all your guest to contribute to a get-together with each person or family being responsible for part of the meal.  We will be doing this on Boxing Day when our extended family gathers here for tea.  The FH's cousin's wife always brings bread rolls, and ham, and my cousin and aunt will likely be in charge of the desserts. (image from goodtoknow.co.uk)2. CREATE GREETINGS CARDS - the suggestion here is to print your own cards using internet resources, but I don't do that.  I find that buying the actual cards in the sales straight after Christmas gives me plenty of choice and as long as I store them carefully and know where they are, I have no problem!  They also suggest using e-cards, but the best of these are usually from companies requiring an annual subscription.  I have to admit that the cards I send are usually to older people who don't use computers so they appreciate a real card.3. TRY REGIFTING - recycle gifts that you receive which don't appeal to you.  A grey area in some people's minds, but I am happy to do that.  I don't always actually re-gift the items, as sometimes they will end up as raffle prizes at the chapel, but they don't go to waste.4. GIVE FREEBIES - This works well until the recipients realise that they have been given freebies.  As the girls have been on the receiving end of this one, I shall just say that I wouldn't do it, having heard their conversations on the matter.5. MAKE PRESENTS - Yes, the fudge and sweet production factory that is my kitchen making goodies for the school staff and some friends is about to swing into production mode next week.  My recommendation is to use tried and trusted recipes, though, and not to attempt something new when so much rests on success, and you may be under pressure of time.  Get all the ingredients in the house, and think about packaging before you start.(image from cookinglight.com)6.  OFFER YOUR TIME - I don't do this as I haven't time to do all I want to do let alone offer services for others, but if you have free time, this would be an option.7.  RECYCLE DECORATIONS - Swap decorations with friends?  You must be joking!  Our decorations are old friends which we only see for about two weeks annually....we love getting them out each year.8.  ...OR MAKE YOUR OWN FANCY BAUBLES - Making things from leaves, and spraying pine cones is a lovely concept, and there are tonnes of ideas on Pinterest as they rightly say.  It's just not me, though, and I would have to go miles to find any pine cones round here, so it wouldn't really work for us.  Christmas is about Christ, family and spending time together, and I don't want to make my Christmas more complicated than that.9.  PLAY CHEAP GAMES - The YFG loves playing board games, and has a wee heap in her room, and she will rope people in to play something with her.  I dare say that there will also be some tournaments on the Wii as the girls don't get a lot of time to play games during term time, but they do enjoy thrashing one another at MarioKarts when they get the chance.  Because they don't spend hours playing these games day in and day out, they are still enjoyable and fresh when they do have a little spare time.(image from justbeachild.com)10.  POST A FREE LETTER TO SANTA - Our days of doing this are long gone, but we have done it in the past!11.  ENJOY CHURCH CAROLS - Plenty of churches will be putting on carol services this month and we will be having our own on Saturday afternoon here - cue prep work for me, but they are enormous fun, and everyone loves singing carols - and singing is good for you, too!(image from scarboroughcollege.co.uk)12.  LOCAL EVENTS AND ENTERTAINMENT - An excellent suggestion to check out your local council's information and see what they have got going on in the area for families and people in December.  There is bound to be something going on - we have had a Christmas market nearby in the town on Sunday, and there are fairs and shows happening in schools and groups all the time.13.  FREE SANTA'S GROTTO - I can't say I support this suggestion really as I have yet to see a Santa's grotto that didn't make a charge for a gift from Santa.  14.  MAKE YOUR OWN HAMPER - there have been threads about this for several years on MSE, and people make the most amazing hampers!  From stocking up through the year on bargains to making glorious home-made jars of goodness, making your own hampers can be a wonderfully satisfying thing to do.  Just make sure you don't blow the budget on the actual container for the goodies!15.  SEND INVISIBLE PRESENTS TO CUT POSTAGE COSTS - completely agree!  I have sent packages to older children in Scotland for the last few years and the postage costs sometimes outweighed the value of the gifts.  Vouchers, e-cards, codes for a download - much better!  Having said that, I have decided that no one outside the family over 16 is getting a gift this year, so those particular youngsters are off my Christmas list now and I don't have to worry about postage or anything.  One has to draw a line somewhere.16.  FIND THE CHEAPEST POSTAGE METHODS - If you must send parcels, by all means send them by the cheapest method possible.  There are various websites offering services, and we have used one of them very successfully in the past when sending out beehives.  Look for the best deal on the size and weight of the parcel, and go for it.  Otherwise, wait until you meet up with the recipients later on in the year - a present in June makes a lovely surprise occasionally!(image from telegraph.co.uk)17.  GIVE A CUT-PRICE THEATRE TICKET - Can't say we would, but if you are theatre fans, it would be worth a browse to find some deals.18.  PUT OFF CHRISTMAS UNTIL DECEMBER 27th - No way am I going sale shopping after Christmas, but if you are a hard-core bargain hunter, this might be for you.  Giving the gifts after the big day would be hard to pull off with the children, but it might work for extended family members if you are not seeing them until later in the season.  Not one for me.(image from telegraph.co.uk)19.  USE YOUR POINTS - Absolutely!  My Nectar points bought one of the YFG's gifts from Sainsbury's this year, and we used some of our Tesco Clubcard vouchers to double up and bought her board game from Tesco.  The EFG's choices weren't as easy to source from places that used points, but she has had £20 in Amazon vouchers from my Shop and Scan points - more on that in another post.20.  WAIT UNTIL THE VERY LAST MINUTE - No way!  This absolutely would not work for me!  I can't cope with the uncertainty of not knowing that I have got what I need.  However, if you can take the stress of waiting until the afternoon of Christmas Eve to do the shopping, you most likely would score some big bargains on fresh food and decorations.  I'm not so sure about gifts, but the perishable stuff would be reduced to clear with the shops being closed on Christmas Day itself. So that is the advice from one national newspaper, and my thoughts on their ideas.  My own advice is to keep it within your budget, don't go mad and remember that there is no need to buy into a frenzy of consumerism for one day of the year.  Enjoy the season, and don't bash the credit cards, especially if it means you are going to be paying for it for months ahead."},
{"title": "Finding peace - Advent 2", "date": "Monday 9 December 2013", "text": "This morning, a day late, I watched this video and it is brilliant.  It is straight-to-the-heart, and I would urge anyone looking for peace this Advent to go over there and spend 12 minutes listening.  It really made me think, and I actually thought about this a lot today.  I decided that I am, in many ways, enough.I am thin enough, smart enough, tidy enough, busy enough, clever enough, thrifty enough, rich enough, generous enough, mother enough, wife enough, etc.  Doubting myself, putting myself on trial by temptation of any kind, isn't beneficial.I looked at the ways in my life in which I feel inadequate, and resolved to find contentment where I am NOW.  Always striving to be more in any of these areas leads to bad feeling in me, and that is not helpful at all - and it makes me uncharitable towards others, too.  It makes me critical of myself as well as of others, and that is rude and un-Christian.This is part of my trying to find some quiet in this Advent season, because finding contentment and satisfaction in a challenging and aspirational world is tricky, and looking for those qualities day by day will help to bring me to Christ's peace."},
{"title": "A scarlet thread", "date": "Sunday 8 December 2013", "text": "(image from blbclassic.org)This morning, I preached on the story of Rahab from the book of Joshua, the scarlet woman of Jericho, named in the genealogy of Christ.  Whilst I preached, I had a group of children making a paper chain, and on each chain was a name from the genealogy: it perfectly illustrated how each and every one of us has a place in God's plan.  The story also lends itself to a lesson on forgiveness and faith.  I was so overcome this morning by the reaction of the congregation, where one man came to me with tears brimming in his eyes, and told me how much the service had meant to him.  I was almost in tears with him, in awe at how God would use me to speak to this lovely older gentleman.  God is good.This afternoon, I spent time with some older ladies from our own church in the village, as we [wo]manned the stall at the village Christmas Bazaar.  We had lots of lovely cakes to sell, and raised about £60 for the church as well as having a good old natter!The girls were taken out today by UJ to my cousin's house in Lincolnshire.  She and her husband and parents were all there, and they had a lovely lunch together, before my cousin, her husband and my aunt took the girls to an outlet shopping centre.  The girls are not big spenders [wonder where they get that from?!] and each bought only one item - the EFG bought herself a science book, and the YFG bought me a Christmas present!  Very kind of her - dying to know what it is!!All in all, the FH has had a quiet day.  He spent most of it in bed, reading, watching tv and sleeping.  He woke me at 3am saying he was unable to get to sleep and could he have a sleeping pill!  So I gave him one, but I think it made him rather dozy for the rest of the day.  He got up when we all came home around 5pm, but has been more active since he has been up, and has even done the washing up tonight for the first time in ages.  The cough is reducing and the pain in his chest has gone: tomorrow is the last day of taking the antibiotics, so we all have our fingers crossed that they will have cleared the infection out.My dad has phoned up this evening, from Wales, where he is on a weekend coach trip with his partner and her cousins.  The four of them range in age from 74 to 88 so they are all sympathetic to each other's limitations, and apparently Dad has been sitting in a cafe with the older lady of 88 whilst Dad's partner and her relatively younger cousin went for a walk along the sea front in Aberystwyth.  He will be home again tomorrow.  We won't see them actually at Christmas but we will be planning to invite them over for a meal at some point in the festivities.I hope you have all had a relaxing weekend.  I'm coming round to catch up on your blogs tomorrow xx"},

The YFG had been practising her piano pieces like mad as her exam is on Saturday and it is looming large on the horizon - just a couple of days to go.December is upon us, and I haven't had the chance to get the meal plan done yet, so you can see that I am quite behind, and looking forward to doing more of my catching up tomorrow.  I also have a service to prepare for Sunday [stump of Jesse being my theme] and mince pies to make for a sale as well.

{"title": "Advent begins....quietly", "date": "Sunday 1 December 2013", "text": "There has been no great fanfare today, and indeed, a time of silence has been more appropriate as we have heard about the Glasgow helicopter disaster, and thought about the lives lost and families devastated there.   We also heard of a rail crash somewhere in America today, with more lives lost. Christmas is going to be a hard time for a lot of families again this year.The Advent season slipped quietly in, today, on Advent Sunday.  We thought about Jesus, the Light of the World, coming to us.  We considered the concept of waiting in all its forms in our lives, and we remembered that in some ways, we are always in a season of Advent as we wait for Christ to come again.  I'm finding time this Advent to read Ann Voskamp's new book as a daily devotional as it traces Jesus through his family tree.  It holds the stories of so many people, who were not pure, not acceptable, not perfect, and it reminds us that He who is the most sacred hailed from David's line, made acceptable and forgiven by His birth and then His death and resurrection.  It gives the rest of us quiet hope.  I have hopes of a quiet and reflective Advent, preparing some services, and spending time with the family and some friends.  You'll notice that I have used the word \"quiet\" several times, and I am realising that that is what I need more and more at the moment!  I don't want to be dragged around the shops, not pulled to a party, not out and about being busy - I just want to BE and to stop doing for a while.  Finding that quietness is going to be my plan this Advent season.  [In other news, the computer was having me on - as soon as the guru stuck the power cord in and hit the button, it started up.......it has now got four new USB ports in the back, and a new-to-it DVD drive in the front, as as bonus, but it works, thank goodness.]"},
{"title": "Ups and downs", "date": "Saturday 30 November 2013", "text": "Good things to report in that we had a successful shopping trip to Aldi with our vouchers, and I called in at Morrison's for the turkey legs that everyone has been raving about - we had one ages ago and it yielded a load of meat, so I bought two today and stashed them in the freezer.  That will be our turkey ration for the holiday season, although I think a three-bird roast may be on the menu for the day itself.We also went into the supermarket and picked up a big parcel holding the clothes we had ordered with our clubcard boost vouchers, and we were pleased with it all. The downside of the day is that the FH feels that he has been left too long, even though the EFG was here with him all the time that the YFG and I were out at gym and shopping.  The girls both report that he constantly asks whoever is here with him how long it is until I will be home again, so I am becoming more and more conscious of leaving him for any length of time.  Today was a longer than usual Saturday for us, too, since we were out to gym at 9.30am and it was shortly before 4pm when we returned. The second slight problem is that after a little trouble with the front loading USB ports on my desktop, it now resolutely refuses to even turn on!  It seems to have died completely, so I shall have to see if my computer guru can resurrect it!  I'm not holding out a lot of hope, but I will ask him.  The Iconia tablet that the YFG had for her birthday as well as the chapel music one are both being dodgy scrolling down pages on the internet tonight, so I am beginning to think that the computer world and I have fallen out.......I am on the EFG's laptop now and got everything crossed that we get to the end of this post before it conks out on me!If I need to replace that desktop, it will put a serious hole in the budget, but as we have seen, these things are sent to try us, and we will find ways to manage it all in the end!  At least I haven't bought anything huge like a car this year, so I suppose I can afford a basic computer if the need arises. I am sitting here tonight, rebooting the washing machine at intervals and watching The Bible on Channel 5, the first in a series of dramatisations of the Bible.  It has already stimulated a couple of questions from the YFG that I was challenged to answer at this time of night and this level of tiredness.

{"title": "Heads up - Aldi voucher tomorrow", "date": "Wednesday 27 November 2013", "text": "(image from dailymail.co.uk)Just checked on the Facebook page and there WILL be a voucher for £5 off a £40 spend in the Daily Mirror [England and Wales] and the Daily Record [Scotland] tomorrow!  Don't forget to get the paper, and you will usually have a week to use the voucher. They have flown past and we have done so much growing in so many ways since then!  Seventeen years ago today we were married in Cupar registry office, with a small band of friends, and a 12 week old baby in attendance as the only family representative. I wore a £10 cream two piece outfit from the Save the Children shop in St Andrews, and the FH wore his suit.  We had a shared buffet back at the house after the wedding, and then another small gathering of friends in the evening - I think the baby and I had a nap in between!  I made a wheat-and-dairy-free cake and a neighbour iced and decorated it with tartan ribbons for me.All the money in the world spent on that wedding wouldn't have made the marriage any different over the past seventeen years, I am convinced, and so we celebrate the intervening years more than the day we said we did.  We still \"do\" all the promises, and we have thought about having the marriage blessed, and in our typical fashion, we still haven't got around to it. Looking back at the photos, I can see that things have changed: all bar the marriage and the rings and the child have gone by the wayside.  Some of the witnesses are not together themselves any longer, the FH can't fit in to the suit these days, my outfit went back to the charity shop as I had lost weight and it didn't fit, and we have moved so far from that time and place.  We are older and perhaps a little wiser; if not wiser, certainly more experienced as we have learned new things.Marriage is a day-in, day-out commitment which is something of a rarity in this day and age, when things change so often, and the trend seems to be for people to have a short attention span.  It needs to be flexible enough to bend when times change, strong enough to support us when times are tough, and precious enough to cherish all the day long."},

The other tip I can share this week is that when you let teenagers know that you have only got £10 in your budget for this weekend's top-up-on-fruit-and-veg shop, they are much much less likely to want to tag along.......the EFG has realised that I love saving my money and will really only spend £10!Better go and spread that straw and make the soup!  I'll be back after gymnastics tomorrow evening, God willing xxx"},

{"title": "A time for lists", "date": "Wednesday 20 November 2013", "text": "Advent Sunday is not far away as we head towards the end of November, and the time is marching onward towards Christmas.  Here, it feels like a time for list making - who do I need to send a Christmas card to?  Have I bought or made all the gifts for others that I had planned to give?  Who is coming to visit on which day, and what food shall I prepare?  (image from cute-calendar.com)All these things are extra to the real meaning of Christmas, and so I want to get them sorted out and done so that I can concentrate on Jesus.  He is what it is all about for me.  I have a service to prepare for the chapel where we are going to have an impromptu Nativity, so I want to organise some very basic costumes [wish I lived in Leicester, Ang ;) but I will improvise!] and I am really looking forward to taking the time for all of that.  Advent starts soon, so I have a couple of Advent cards that I want to send out, and I am keeping one for myself this year.  I want to enjoy the experience of the waiting, the expectation, without being bowled over with 101 things to do.  Lists seem to be the way to overcome it all.Truth is, there aren't a lot of people I need to send cards to: perhaps my old Kindergarten teacher who is well into her 90s and not on the internet, and she always appreciates a note and some photos as well. Local friends will get hand-delivered cards, and more technologically-savvy but far-flung friends are going to get warmest wishes for a Happy Christmas sent on the interweb this year.  Who thought that a second class stamp would ever cost 50p?  And the gifts - well, the list is a wee bitty shorter this year.  Those young people I have been sending gifts to for years, but who we haven't seen in all that time - I really don't know what they want and whether they really like what I am sending, so now that they are all in their late teens, the gifts will have to stop.  I have picked up various gifts for people over the year, and particularly the last 6 weeks when I turned my attention to the gaps on my list, so I don't have a lot of worrying to do on that front.  I know who is coming, and they are all coming on Boxing Day in the afternoon.  There will be 14 of us to have tea that day, but all the branches of the family will contribute something to the table, and I shall co-ordinate to make sure we don't end up with 40 bread rolls and no pork pie....It will be a buffet, and quite relaxed - and they are all coming on the same day - yay!  I do like to see them, but I want some peaceful family time too.There are three Christmas puds in the cupboard, the cakes are waiting to be marzipaned and iced, and I shall probably buy a three-bird roast again, and perhaps one of those enormous turkey leg joints from Morrison's for me, and for sandwiches.  And for spiritual preparation, I can't wait to watch Ann Voskamp and Liz Curtis Higgs tomorrow as they broadcast, \"Christmas at the Farm\" live on their websites at 5pm here.  I shall have to watch the recording later, but I am so looking forward to it.  They both have Christmas books out, and I have bought both of them, as they are going to be a valuable resource for the coming Christmas services I will be doing in the future - I get a year off this year - as well as wanting to read them myself.  Ann's book, The Greatest Gift, charts the genealogy of Jesus, through the Bible.  Liz's book, The Women of Christmas, shares the stories of Elizabeth, Mary and Anna and reminds us that the Almighty really does value women.  I'm also going to look for Delia Smith's book on Advent which is here on my shelf...just not quite sure which shelf....I hope you can enjoy the season, whatever your beliefs, as a time of fellowship, friendship and renewal."},
{"title": "Making the right choices", "date": "Tuesday 19 November 2013", "text": "I've had a kind of strange week for me, where I have been questioning choices, and looking twice at things that I do, and that I buy.  I was reading Froog's blog about the effective use of food, and portion sizes and things like that, and although there is a lot of sense in what she says, I don't agree with everything she writes. But it did spur me on to think more about making the most of every penny and how we spend our money.We already live fairly frugal lives already, but there are always more strategies we could employ to go further, and I realise that.  I don't crochet dishcloths, I don't recycle bathwater, I don't shop exclusively at German supermarkets, I never go to the real market any more, I hardly ever have time to mooch around the charity shops.  It is a balance between time, energy, motivation and experience.  And I don't mean historical experience that we can learn from, I mean rather what I want to experience today, how I want to spend my time and consider it well spent and, sometimes, enjoyed. I sat for thirty minutes this morning and listened to a radio interview on a website from America, that was actually broadcast yesterday, but in the middle of the night here, so not convenient at the time.  I made notes and I immersed myself in the experience.  I enjoyed it.  It didn't save me a penny but it enriched my life.  It didn't cost me a penny, either, though!I've thought again about our menu, and how I could make our food bill less - we could buy less lunch meat and I could eat more soup.  I've reflected on the seasonal nature of our food, and remembered that actually, some foods taste far less appealing out of season - when you have had a warm tomato fresh from the vine in the greenhouse, supermarket varieties are insipid and uninspiring, so better to wait until the greenhouse produces plenty again before we eat tomatoes.  Considering portion sizes is an important way of making sure that we don't waste precious food pennies, as well as the food itself, and that smaller portions are a good way to reduce waist as well as waste!And then there is stewardship.  Am I really being a good steward of all the resources at my disposal?  Am I caring for everything the way it should be cared for and maintained?  Could I do better?  Absolutely. As 2013 draws to a close [I'm told that there are less than 6 weeks left of this year] my thoughts are turning to producing my calendar for next year as already dates are inscribed on bitty scraps of paper as my time in 2014 is becoming allocated to hospital trips, courses and meetings.  Thoughts of finding different ways of doing things are taking my time and filling my prayers as I realise my shortcomings this year.  I think back over the challenges and experiences that 2013 has brought to us as a family, and I would pray not to have to go through some of them again, as thoughts of death and pain haunted my dreams early in the year, and yet we have known happiness, joy and friendships beyond measure as people we love have united to support us and hold us up through the darker days. This life is a good one, a blessed one, and finding grace in small things is a way of treasuring the experiences, piecing together the joys, and the realisation that we are rich beyond measure is humbling as I reflect that life is not all about the bank balance.  Truly, the more I have of anything, the more I can share, whether it is a box of chocolates for a raffle, sponsoring a child through Compassion or WorldVision, giving time to a friend or family member to listen to a story, spending time caring for the FH, or making a donation to the foodbank. All that considered, I am going to have to buy myself some new clothes as I have lived in two pairs of jeans almost this whole year, and I am sure folk are fed up of seeing me in this uniform!  It's either going to be spending vouchers from that supermarket or hitting the charity shops on a sunny Saturday afternoon."},

(image from salisburymuseum.org.uk)I have to say that I enjoyed the programme last night, and the new chap seemed to fit in with the team well.  I don't think I would have got on with wearing a wimple all the time as Ruth was doing, and having my fire in the middle of the room, with all that smoke about the place, wouldn't have suited me either!  It was interesting to see the ploughing with the cattle, but I am not a fan of the early seed-broadcasting methods as there seemed to be quite few bare patches in the field of peas when they came through.  I would also have had my rubber gloves on when the bloke was making the pig house with the wattle-and-daub made from horse manure.....My knitting grew a few inches and I was glad of a sit down after a busy day.......another one on the cards, so I had better get on.  The YFG has been off school this week with a hacking cough - she did try to go yesterday but I had to fetch her home again after a couple of hours as the heat in the building was just making her worse and she had had two teachers already telling her she didn't ought to be there!"},

{"title": "Elaine's Sultana Bread", "date": "Thursday 7 November 2013", "text": "Just to share that I have got this rising near the fire this evening after making the dough in the bread machine.  It smells gorgeous already, so the aroma released when I actually cook it are going to be something else!  The FH loves this kind of bread, so he is looking forward to a taste later.  Shouldn't be too long....I have been looking online for the recipe I used yesterday from Delicious magazine, but I can't find it at all...It is Mary Berry's recipe [one of her Christmas cake recipes] so I shall share my version of it, on the basis that a list of ingredients is not copywritable, and anyway, I changed it slightly!The amount in the magazine is supposed to fill a 23cm round cake tin, but I haven't got one of those - first challenge of the day!  Actually, though, it filled a 17cm one AND a 19cm one amply, so I managed to get two smaller round fruit cakes out of the amount.  Then I made it all again, and filled a 18.5cm square tin and a 2lb loaf tin from the second batch.  The aroma in my kitchen yesterday was amazing!At the weekend, I soaked the fruit in the brandy.  The original intention was to soak it overnight, but it ended up being for about three days.  It certainly didn't come to any harm, and we stirred it often.The soaking part is for this fruit - and these are the amounts I used, not the exact original recipe - 500g currants [just used the whole packet!]250g raisins250g sultanas150g dried apricots200g glace cherries [these are expensive and 300g for each mixture seemed too many]80g mixed peelThe dried apricots were of the \"ready-to-eat\" variety, and I used organic ones, which were all Sainsbury's had available, but it meant that they weren't too bright an orange colour and blended in well with the rest of the fruit.  I had to chop them up into small pieces.The cherries were quartered and then rinsed and dried of all the gloopy sugary syrup.All of that was set in a bowl and 4 generous tablespoons of brandy was mixed through it.  Lovely smell!Yesterday, I double lined and greased the baking tins, including the 100+ year old one from my grandfather's bakery which is the smallest one, and got on with the baking.I beat 300g of margerine [never buy real butter, sorry!] and 300g dark brown sugar [muscovado is the recommended, but hadn't got any of that...] together, and then slowly added 5 eggs beaten with a tablespoon of black treacle, alternating with the flour mixture [300g plain flour, 2 tsps mixed spice and half a tsp of nutmeg and the grated rind of a lemon] so that it all mixed together nicely.Then I put all the fruit in.  Major arm exercise followed as I mixed the fruit into the batter!I shared the mixture between the two round tins, then repeated the whole exercise to make the mixture for the square and loaf tins.  They all went in a low [120C] oven together.  The loaf cake was done in just under two hours, the round cakes took about three, and the square cake about 3 and a half.  I just kept checking them!One tip I did find very handy was to cover the cake with a circle [or square as appropriate] of baking paper so that the top didn't brown too quickly.  I found that this also avoided the odd burnt pieces of fruit that I have had rise to the top before and sit there on top of the cake like Nanny MacPhee's wart!The loaf cake has been used for taste testing already, and UJ and the FH have judged it most satisfactory, moist and full of flavour.  Success indeed.Now the remaining three cakes are to be double wrapped and stored away until the week before Christmas when they will be covered in marzipan and iced.  Looking forward to that!  Photos at that stage."},

{"title": "A ghost story for you", "date": "Thursday 31 October 2013", "text": "When asked whether I believe in ghosts, I have had to say that I do, at least since 1998, when we bought a haunted house.  I didn't realise until after we moved in, and the FH always refused to believe, but my gut feeling was corroborated by some one else later on....We bought a three storey house, just two doors away from the house we lived in.  With the help of a loan from my dad and a mortgage, we bought the new house before we actually sold the one we owned, in which all our money was tied up.  We bought the new house on 1st August, and it was the autumn before we agreed a sale on the other house, with an entry date in January.  In Scotland, the entry date was part of the offer process, so we knew we had a definite deadline to make the other house habitable.  It was an old house, over 200 years old, built for the Tullis Russell papermaking family of Glenrothes.Now, the other house, Lynwood, had indeed been inhabited by a family with several [four or even five] daughters but they had all grown up and moved away, and the couple had split up, so the lady of the house was there on her own.  They had lived there for over 40 years, and a lot of work was needed to bring it up to what we expect today, or even expected in 2000! Since we and two boys lodging with us would be moving in, we needed to focus on the kitchen/dining arrangements in the basement, and the bedrooms under the eaves.  In the basement, the FH ripped everything out and took the house back to bare stone walls, replasterboarding everything, installing a new central heating system, new cooker, a new kitchen, the works!  He worked long hours on it, with only amateur help from local \"old boys\" both well into their seventies, but both very hard working.  My dad came up from England and spent time helping too, encouraged by my mother, who was worried to death by the enormity of the restoration project we had taken on. In the attic space, we created a master en-suite bedroom, two single bedrooms and a family bathroom from a space which had previously just been two large bedrooms and a boxroom.  We had to install a fireman's window in one of the rooms which was a Velux in which a fireman wearing breathing apparatus could enter, such were the building regs.  It gave us amazing views across the town , taking in the spires of the churches.We just about got all this done in time to move, and we just left the middle floor, where there was a big sitting room, a study, a smaller sitting room and a family bathroom.  We moved in and piled boxes and building equipment into those rooms, as there was no outside storage sheds or garage at all.  The FH would build a garage in the months ahead but for now, it was all stored inside the house!That middle floor was where I felt incredibly uneasy.  I would scoot around the corner from the stairs up from the basement and breath a sigh of relief when I gained the top landing where the bedrooms were, because it was usually on the corner that I would glimpse her, out of the corner of my eye.  As one came up from the basement, the big sitting room was to the right, and there was a window in one's eyeline, to the right of the fireplace.  Glancing into the room as one went past, it was there that I would \"see\" her, an old woman, sitting in a rocking chair, shawl about her shoulders, patiently rocking herself. As we began to work on that floor, we changed things, we took up floorboards and we moved out forty years of accumulated dust and cobwebs, and the amazing thing was that as we disturbed the settled energy of forty years, we seem to have dislodged her.  As the house was renewed, revitalised and refreshed, she went, completely went.And to prove that I was not totally daft, later in 1999, after I had given birth to the YFG and the FH had had his transplant, a neighbour brought round a young lady who had known the previous family and had spent many summers staying there with them.  The neighbour wanted to show the lady the transformation that we had wrought on the house, but I sat breastfeeding the YFG and the FH was asleep one afternoon, so I asked the neighbour to show the woman around herself, before they came back to the room where we were.  The young lady was pleased with what we had done and marvelled at the transformation, and then she said, \"And the ghost has gone!\" to which I calmly replied that I thought we had moved her on, quite unintentionally and unwittingly, with all the renovation work - that the house had changed so much that there was no energy left for her to cling on to any longer. I talked to that house, quite the most sentimental thing I have ever felt, but on the morning we left it in 2000, I walked around and told it how much it meant to me, how sorry I was to be leaving it, and how I wished it well.  It seemed to thank us for revitalising it, and I confess that leaving that house destroyed any feeling for houses that I had - a house to me now is just somewhere to live, and I haven't yet found another one I have loved with that kind of passion. I confess that I had forgotten what one calls a group of owls - it isn't a flock or a flight, but a parliament - something to do with a collection of wisdom, I think that the intention was once!  However, in my experience, we don't often see a lot of owls together in the Fens - we occasionally see a beautiful barn owl swooping low along the ditches at dusk when we are in the car, and it is a quite spectacular sight so we feel very blessed to see it.This little gang has just appeared over the past few days - I just finished a couple in the top row tonight, and the EFG has been busy making the wee pals in the bottom row.  One is not a Christmassy one, but still looks great.I have an idea for a better photograph once I have made a few more, so watch this space - I shall need a few more owls, and a sunny day, so don't hold your breath, given the weather forecast tonight...."},
{"title": "Quick kitchen tip", "date": "Wednesday 30 October 2013", "text": "I thought I would share this as I have just done it in my kitchen, and although many of you may already know this handy tip, it might help someone out there!Several times a year, I buy two or three 1kg bags of supermarket value table salt, and at the moment, it would cost you 25p/kg in either Tesco or Sainsbury's.  I use it very simply to keep my drains running clear, and the method is a breeze.(image from mysupermarket.co.uk)First, snip off a corner of the bag and carefully pour enough salt in to the plug hole so that it stands there like a little mountain of salt.  It will begin to slump into the holes, so I keep pouring until it stands still.  Then I go and fill the kettle with as much water as it will take.  The salt does seem to need to sit there for a few minutes, so don't try to be efficient and boil the kettle first!   When the kettle is boiling, grab it and pour it onto the heap of salt.  It will bubble a bit, glug a bit sometimes, but your drain will run clear within minutes.  If it is really bunged up, I have done this a couple of times, maybe using half the bag of salt altogether, but I have never failed to clear a drain with this method.Even if your drains aren't blocked, I like to do this once a month to keep them fresh.  It costs pennies, and is much better than using a bottle of something stinking and chemical-based.  [OK, I have a daughter doing A level chemistry and I know salt has a chemical name, but you know what I mean ;)]  It is heaps cheaper too!"},

 Astonish Toilet Bowl cleaner tabs 5 for 99p.  I currently use some professional stuff from Hagesan Blue to do a deep clean each week, so I want to see if these are as effective.  I have tried cheap coca cola that someone gave us, and it doesn't do the job.Astonish Whites Booster 5 for 99p I have been using these for a while and find them useful for attempting to get the girls' white PE socks white again....Bounty 5 bars for £1.00.  One of the FH's rare treats.Chocolate Malt Balls & Rainbow Choc Drops  Clearly supposed to imitate other more well-known brands, these are a \"I'm going to be doing more baking in the run-up to Christmas\" store-cupboard item.  There are going to be cake stalls happening and Coffee mornings, so it is good to be prepared.  These are £1 a tub.Carrot Cake Mix - Going up in the world.  The last time we ordered \"de-identified\" carrot cake mix, it was actually from Morrison's and we used it to make muffins.  This batch is from M&S no less.  Four boxes for £1.  Bargain.Fox's Caramel 9 pack (75p) and Jacob's Oddities 15 for £3 - these are both items for the YFG's lunchbox.  They will last her several weeks, for snacks at school and for energy at gymnastics.Raspberry Jam 340g jar for 75p - this is lovely quality jam, much like we can get from Lidl's but a bit cheaper.Heinz Red Cabbage in Vinegar (710g) and Sweet Silverskin Onions in Vinegar (440g)  These are all for the FH.  Since he came out of hospital in July, with a new tablet, his tastebuds are affected and he seems to crave vinegary foods all the time.  The red cabbage is a particular favourite, and sells here for 60p a jar, compared to over £1.50 a jar at the supermarket.  The silverskin onions are three jars for a pound.Kellogg's Special K crackercrisps These are for the EFG as she likes them and they don't cost too many WW points as a treat.Knorr Bake in a Bag Creamy Fish Herbs and White Wine sauce - this is cheap at 3 for £1, and quickly adds a touch of luxury to a frozen fish portion!Mallow Snowballs and Teacakes - these are mis-shapes from Lees of Scotland, two packs of Snowballs for £1 and the teacakes at 40p a pack.  The YFG will eat some of these, but I will also use them when I need to take a food donation to the Craft Club at the chapel, or to a coffee morning, if I haven't time to bake.  I much prefer to bake something myself, but when push comes to shove, I would rather take something like this than go empty-handed - and the ladies love these teacakes!Mooch Original chocolate milk - this was an AF gamble, and I do make them occasionally.  The description wasn't quite enough to tell me exactly what I was getting when I ordered it, and I wondered if it was hot chocolate powder.  It has turned out to be three cans of milkshake for 99p.  I wouldn't buy them again.Ocean Spray Raspberry and Cranberry juice drink 3 x 200ml - I got four of these three-packs for £3, and I think that they will be very handy to have in the cupboard for when one of us ladies gets a twinge of cystitis, as we occasionally do.  Usually I have to buy big cartons, and it isn't all needed, so I am glad to have these available at a very reasonable price.  They are UHT and will last for ages!Polos - people here do like Polos now and again and 12 rolls for £1.50 is a bargain.  The storecupboard will smell dreadfully of mint if I put them in there, so they are on a shelf in the garage!Apricot jam 2 x 370g jars for £1.  It is the time of year to make the Christmas cake now, and I always, always forget to buy apricot jam to stick the marzipan on to the cake with!  Not this year...Walnut cake - we can't get enough walnuts in this house, one way or another, so I thought that those who can eat cake might try this.  Cost 99p.Toblerone - four little Toberones for £1, another little treat for the FH.  Put away, he will forget about them and be chuffed when I fetch one out for him occasionally - they will last for ages as he won't ask for them!Wagon Wheel original 6-pack - free for spending £30.  Useful for lunchboxes and snacks at gym.  Walker's Shortbread - the YFG will inhale shortbread - she absolutely loves the stuff and I really should make it for her more often, but in the meantime, this is the next best thing to home-made.  I shall hide this away or it won't last the week.......and I do recognise that this is one of the problems that people have with this kind of shopping - we do have to be disciplined with eeking the food out over a period of time.Apparently the total RRP of that lot would have been £99.67 but that is academic because I wouldn't have bought some of those brands if I had been shopping in a supermarket for those items.  I actually paid £36.32 and the £5.25 delivery charge, so a total of £41.57.  I am unlikely to place another order now until at least the middle to end of January."},
{"title": "Creative day", "date": "Monday 28 October 2013", "text": "We had a great start to the day when Ang and Rev Bob popped in on their way home from Norfolk so we had a lovely chat and a cuppa.  It was great to meet them - my first blogland meeting - and they are lovely, as I thought they would be!  Rev Bob is very tall!  Thanks for the George Foreman grill, Ang - we are going to try it out this week!This afternoon, I continued with my resting theme for the weekend, and watched Mamma Mia with the FH whilst the girls went for a walk in the late autumn sunshine which had broken through after the storm.  Whilst I was watching the film, I made the little owl above - it's a Christmas tree decoration.  I am going to seal the edges of the wings with some pva glue to stop them from fraying.  I'm quite chuffed with my first one, and then I sat and cut out the felt and material for five more.  We have run out of the appropriate coloured threads to actually make any more up today, so I turned my attention to knitting and finished off the last scarf for the Christmas boxes.  We will be packing the OCC boxes this Friday, so it was just in the nick of time too. And the storm?  Yes, it passed over us without doing too much damage.  The whole garden is sodden, so we must have had a lot of rain overnight, but the early morning about 7am apparently saw the strongest gusts of wind.  The only actual damage we sustained here was where two fence panels became detached from their common fence post, so the FH went round to the neighbour's side and straightened the nails so he could bang them back in whilst I held the panels in position from our side.  It was all rectified in about 20 minutes.I've been watching the news and thinking about all those who have had serious damage to their homes and businesses, and the families of those who have lost their lives this weekend.  Such terrible scenes on the television news reports today - it gives us a great deal to be thankful for here tonight."},
{"title": "St Jude", "date": "Sunday 27 October 2013", "text": "Someone has called the storm which is approaching the UK after the patron saint of lost causes, which is probably less to do with the naming than the fact that tomorrow is the saint's day in the Catholic Church's calendar of saints' days.  The Guardian explains more about it here.We have done all we can to prepare for this storm, including finally getting batteries in the torch!  The full Calor gas bottles had to be connected up yesterday as the last of the old ones had emptied, so we have plenty of gas for cooking and boiling water if we lose the electricity.  Everything in the garden has been secured; the only thing I am slightly worried about is our metal chimney, but there's nothing I can do about that.  We have firewood aplenty for keeping warm, and lots of food.  There are also no trees in the vicinity so we should be safe from falling timber just here.  That's not to say we may not be affected by flying debris, I suppose.  The worst of the storm is predicted between 5am and 8am so I hope we get some sleep before then!  We are expecting visitors tomorrow but I shan't blame them one iota if they make a dash for home and postpone their visit!I just pray that we are all safe and well, you in your homes and us here, by tomorrow evening when the storm has passed over.  Keep safe xAnn Voskamp has posted a list of links, and there is one which is especially beautiful - I would recommend you get a cup of tea and just sit and take in the beauty of these photographs here.  Simply stunning!"},
{"title": "Another lazy day", "date": "Saturday 26 October 2013", "text": "We enjoyed a later-than-usual start to the day, and once I had sorted out the outside chores, I sat with the girls and watched a DVD!  The outside chores did take a little longer than usual as I had to put sawdust and shavings down for the chickens, and I also had a tidy up around the yard to try to make sure that there isn't any flying debris or plant pots when the wind gets up this weekend or early on Monday.  I am not looking forward to this storm at all.After a roast chicken dinner at lunchtime [the chicken had been in the slow cooker overnight], we washed up together and then headed off to Ely, one of our favourite destinations.  It takes a wee while to get there, but it is well worth it when we do arrive!  The FH came for the ride and had a potter around the town.  We bought some felt from a craft shop for the EFG and YFG to do some Christmas decorations....and when we got home, we realised that it was actually a bit on the pricey side and we have since found some much more competitively priced on ebay, but we must be grateful to the high street shops for providing us with a source of instant goods when we need them!The EFG then spent the latter part of the afternoon and a lot of the evening making these items.  I am impressed, and am thinking about making some myself.......I have to make 22 of something for the staff at school, and have done chocolates of one variety or another for the last three years, so I think it is time for a change.  Whether I have time to make enough of these is another matter.  I'll finish my current scarf-in-progress and then decide.  Ideas and suggestions welcomed.This evening, we have watched Strictly, and then we had the DVD of Anna Karenina on, which the girls gave me for my birthday in September.  I didn't like it at first but gradually got into it - I found the \"play\" setting a bit strange, but got used to it.  Jude Law and Keira Knightly do well in it, I thought, and the costumes are very well done.  I don't think I will aspire to read the book, but I admire anyone who has done so.Whilst we were in Ely, we went to Aldi and spent the first of my two £5 vouchers.  I shall spend the other one next Thursday in a different store, with an alternative focus to my shopping - today's was very much one for stocking up on tins and stores, whereas next week, we shall be in need of fresh fruit and veg, cheese and cold meats, all of which are very good at Aldi."},
{"title": "Got that Friday feeling", "date": "Friday 25 October 2013", "text": "We've had a relaxing day in many ways - the girls had a long lie-in this morning since they didn't need to get up for school.  I let the chooks out and popped off to school to give out a couple of prizes in the celebration assembly today, which was fun!  Then I came home to see who was up - they were all awake at least...The Craft Club at the chapel was the next thing, and I was really chuffed to have time to sit and knit my scarf in between helping to make the tea.  We began to wrap shoe boxes in Christmas paper in preparation for the Operation Christmas Child boxes to be filled and dispatched.  We only have 12 boxes so we need about 13 more to get to our target of 25 this year, but several of the ladies think that they might have odd ones at home and have promised to ferret them out for us.  Next week we will be having our Worship Lunch, and will be having jacket potatoes so we made arrangements today for the cooking - we have no oven at the chapel and so we have a lovely lady who lives not far away who has offered to cook them for us. Nipped home for some lunch with the family and then I took the girls and we went to school.  The massive project of cataloguing and stickering books for a reading programme is still underway, and I took advantage of the girls' availability to have a good sort out in the library at school. Tonight, we have had our supper and the YFG and the FH are watching a horror film together, and there is a lot of screaming going on!  The EFG has one eye on the tv but she is doing some sewing, making felt Christmas tree decorations - they are very good and I am impressed - hope she makes a few more.  I'll share some pictures when she has finished some. I am sitting at the table with the EFG, using her laptop to go through the websites of the unis which she is thinking of applying to, looking for their financial support packages - Aberdeen and Aberystwyth are the most generous, and I shall be encouraging her to apply to both of them as the extra benefits of the awards will more than offset the extra travel costs, I believe.  I can see a uni finance post coming up in the not too distant future!I am about to put a chicken in the slow cooker to roast overnight, and I know that when we wake up in the morning, the house will be full of the most delicious smells!  Better go and sort it out - hope you all have a great weekend, and thanks for reading xxAnd there aren't an awful lot of pennies left!  This has been a quite horrendous month spending wise, and it is plain to me to see why we have had to even eat into some of last month's meagre savings to make it through the month.(image from sheffield.ac.uk)Spends over and above the normal run of things this month have been out of proportion to a usual month, and contributed to the lack of saving.The Aberystwyth trip cost me just over £220 with the hotel, the fuel, the meals and the toll road.I had dental work done costing £128.50.The house insurance was due - still a very good price with the Co-op but £196.31 nevertheless.The Skoda needed a full set of new tyres and some repair work done - £449.69!The YFG needed some new underwear - £42 for 3 bras!School supplies for the girls have also had to be bought - a lab coat for the EFG @ £10.50 and revision guides for the YFG @ £8.25.The YFG has been entered for her Grade two piano exam, for £41.That comes to just over £1100 of additional expenses this month, and all of them very necessary.  I was incredibly grateful for the work done on the car before we went to Aberystwyth because I felt safe and secure driving across the country on wet roads.  That trip couldn't really have been made any cheaper as the train fare would have cost more than the diesel did, and wouldn't have helped the other end when we may have been in need of a taxi!  The house insurance price is the cheapest I found anywhere, and I did look for other quotes, and the dental work was also necessary.All in all, a very expensive month which has damaged my savings plan irrevocably now for the year, so I will be re-adjusting my targets and looking forward to 2014 with some new ways to save and perhaps a different way of organising our accounting.  Onwards, ever onwards - I try to learn from months like these and then let them go!"},
{"title": "Three generational living", "date": "Thursday 24 October 2013", "text": "I've been on the verge of losing my temper several times today, and been quite frustrated, and I am not proud of myself at all.  Patience is a virtue, and I need to develop some!The FH is coming up to his 76th birthday, I've just had my 41st, the EFG is 17 and the YFG 14.  Quite a spread of ages living together as one family.  Nothing particularly special, but different from the norm, perhaps.  On our street, there are other multigenerational households, where three generations live together, but their family dynamic is slightly different.There's the old lady who lives in the annexe of the house where her daughter's family live, and there's another residence where it is even more complicated than us in that the oldest generation live in a static caravan in the garden, and in the house, there are three more generations of the family......and whilst these are biggish houses, they are not mansions and some of them are bursting at the seams!In our house, as you know, the FH and I are married, and so there are no other spouses in our respective generations who understand our take on situations, and with whom to share the frustrations.  I know that the FH has felt as cross about some things as I have, but we haven't argued - we don't!  It isn't a huge issue but it is one into which I need to put some thought, and maybe some actions, not the least prayers.I know that some of the things I do and say wind him up, but then things that he does and says are frustrating to me at times: we've been to the rheumatologist for the third time today, and despite lots of preparation, the FH asked the chap what causes gout......I know that he has explained it to the FH on both the previous visits!  Similarly, we know that the FH hates football, but we really don't need to have the full force of his hatred every time that it is mentioned in print or on tv.  For my part, I have been very busy lately with school stuff, and I know he would appreciate it if I was able to put more time into preparing more interesting meals, for example.It is good for the FH to have UJ here, as they are a similar age, they get along well and they provide company and chat for one another.  They can peruse their memories and share their stories in a way that I can't take part, because I don't have the memories.  The FH also enjoys spending time with his mates from the lunch club, again because they remember old times and share stories.  This is becoming a bigger part of his life now, and it is one in which I struggle to participate.  It is also good for him to get out and share his love and knowledge of beekeeping, although he has had to admit that he is not up to keeping his own colonies any longer.I am still at a time in my life where I want to grow and develop and learn new things, but that time has passed for the FH and he shows no interest in any new ideas or learning.  His attitude is somewhat that the old ways are the best [and sometimes he is very right in that assertion]. Are we growing apart?  No.  We are still growing together, but at different rates - his rate of growth has almost stilled, but mine is still moving forward.  Our paths are entwined, and we need to look at ways to make the flowers at the side of the paths flourish so that the way ahead is an attractive one, rather than a chore.  The path is slightly uphill at the moment, and we must pull together to achieve a co-operative, happy lifestyle for the whole family.  I am keenly aware that we must remain an inclusive family and not let age or infirmity limit the involvement of the FH in family life.  To that end, I am encouraging him to do what he can with the girls, and to be a vital part of all our lives. Sometimes the relationships between the girls and the FH need a bit of mediation, and I am not as good at that as perhaps I could be.  They are teenagers, and most men of his age are not living in a house where they have to contend with hair straightners on the landing on a daily basis [he hasn't tripped over them yet because I usually get there first and pick them up], with them having friends round for sleepovers and the anxious days of exams.  They are both very good at supporting me with looking after him if he is poorly, for which I am constantly grateful.Thinking about the quality of our lives here, I still think we are incredibly blessed, and I will continue to advocate for the FH whenever he wants me to when we are dealing with doctors and other medical staff, as I understand his thoughts on the way he wants to live now.  Quality of life is an important yard stick for us all, however old we are!"},

Just read on the Aldi Facebook page that there will be a £5 off when you spend £40 in Aldi voucher available in the Daily Mirror on Thursday this week.  I have noticed that these vouchers are often valid for a week [slightly longer than the Lidl ones] so if I can organise myself to pick up a paper on Thursday, I will have a voucher for my stock-up trip to Aldi next week.  Bargain, and no catches, and only a reasonable spend required: just what I like!"},

The morning passed by in a blur of washing, talking with UJ, chatting with the family about the weekend, having some lunch, and then, as we were chatting again after lunch, I suddenly looked at my watch and realised it was time to get to church, for the Harvest Festival service.  I had prepared the service for the FH and another chap to deliver, but the FH thought I should do his part since I was back, and the other chap didn't turn up until 15 minutes into the service, so I just carried on!It was a lovely service, with the village brass band playing for the hymns, and having a slot in the middle of the service to play their own selection - It's Raining Men, Love Story, something from How to Train Your Dragon and then Born Free to round it off - they were magnificent and we were very proud of them all!This evening, I have finally had a chance to catch up on a few rows of my knitting, and I have watched Downton Abbey.  UJ has gone home, but he will be back to stay again overnight on Tuesday to come to the Harvest Supper and then the lunch club on Wednesday - he's almost moving in!  We do enjoy him being here, so it is a pleasure to have him stay more often. I have no appointments until tomorrow afternoon, so I plan to catch up on some housework, and washing [there's always washing to do here!] and then I have a quiz to prepare for the Harvest Supper evening....anyone got any good questions?!And here's the photo of the prom at Aberystwyth I have been promising - taken yesterday afternoon at about 4pm, just as we were leaving.  The hotel is in that row of houses on the left, and the sea is just the other side of the cars on the right.  Five of the houses are now Halls of Residence, and the noise on a Friday night was, well, as might be expected for a load of students, I suppose - loud!"},

By 2.30pm, after being caught in the rain, we were back in our hotel room, and the EFG was reading a magazine whilst she had a snack, and I was reading, sat on the bed with a cup of tea.  I idly suggested that I would be up for coming home, but she convinced me to stay another night, as planned, and then got on with some chemistry homework for an hour.  Just before 4pm, she said, \"SHALL we go home?\" and we started to gather our stuff!  We were on the road by 4.15pm, and home here by 9pm!Yes, it would have been nice to enjoy another night in a hotel, relaxing, but actually, the reality to us both was that it was preferable to get home to our family and our own house!  We realised that staying another night would actually be a waste, and so we came home.....We surprised the FH and the YFG, and UJ, but they were really pleased to see us, which was very rewarding!  The EFG was shattered, and in bed asleep shortly before 10pm.  I am about to nod off too.There are no photos, as with the rain and miserable weather we had during the day, we didn't take any!  The weather cleared up when we were leaving, and I managed one shot of the prom where the hotel is, so I shall share that tomorrow.  We have both really enjoyed visiting Aberystwyth and it is a definite on her application list, along with Lincoln.....what the other three end up being remains to be seen."},

We found Morrison's, and had our tea there as it was very reasonable!  We have come back to the room now, and I am chatting to you, and catching up on your blogs, whilst the EFG does some homework.  Later on we are doing to watch a DVD, and read.  I have also brought my knitting so I can do a few rows whilst we watch the film. We have a full day of talks and tours tomorrow, so we won't be late to bed, and I am tired as driving always makes me sleep well!  We have an appointment to ring  home at 9pm, and I have also had a word with my dad to let him know we arrived safely.

The outcome is that we have decided that our husbands will stage-manage the service, or direct operations, if you will.  We have children who will read prayers, we have a band to play the music and some volunteers to do the readings.  There won't be a sermon, but there can be a short \"message\" about the harvest meaning.  It will be fine, I keep telling myself, as God will be there and that is what matters.Today has been quieter really, and I have had the chance to do some washing, hoovering and tidying.  The bags are not yet packed for Aberystwyth, but the clothes are washed ready at least!  The route is planned and the offer of a satnav has been taken up so we shall have TomTom directing us when we feel the need.  UJ has returned from a blustery week on the North Norfolk coast, and we are glad to have him close to home again.  The caravan there has been sold and we believe it will be removed from the site next month so that era is well and truly over now.  We shall have to look for other affordable holiday venues for next summer as I want to have a holiday together somewhere next year: the EFG will be off to uni next September so I feel like next summer is our last certain opportunity to do things like that, as who knows what she will find to do in the future?!I was going to add that not a penny has been spent today, but that wouldn't have been true as the FH has been to his lunch club.  He is getting concerned about the sustainability of the group as the attendance has dropped significantly lately and the costs are not being covered.  It would be a shame to see it close but the charges can hardly be raised any further as they are already charging £4.50 for a main course and a pudding, which whilst not extortionate, is still plenty."},

Our winter preparations are well underway, and we feel reasonably secure in the knowledge that we won't starve or freeze if we can't get out for a couple of days.  We have two loads of firewood as well as the pallet wood that the FH has been collecting, we have a tank which is half full of oil, and two bottles of gas for the hob.  We can get through power cuts and still keep warm.  The food stores are full [although I do think we need a couple more cartons of UHT milk, must make a note!] and we will be fine, whenever the snow comes.I don't doubt that the snow WILL come, it is just a question of when.  I really hope that it doesn't hit this weekend [I'm fairly sure it won't] as the EFG and I are off to Aberystwyth on Friday for the Open Day there on Saturday.  This week I will be making preparations for that trip, and sorting out stuff to leave here for the FH and YFG - UJ is coming to be with them for the weekend, as the responsibility of looking after the FH is too much for a 14 year old and I would rather that UJ was here with them in case anything goes wrong whilst we are away.  We will be away for two nights, so I am slightly concerned about my food [wheat and dairy restrictions] for that length of time as we usually self-cater, but you can't self-cater for two nights very easily as there just isn't anything available.  We have booked a hotel for two nights, so I am going to ring them on Monday and see what they can do to help me!The girls are going out with my cousin tomorrow so I am looking forward to some rest and relaxation once I get the church service done in a nearby village - I will be home by 12, and then my feet will be going up!"},

The bill has come in for the Skoda service and new tyres at £449, and I have been to the dentist this afternoon and parted with £128.   I hadn't budgeted for needing all four tyres replaced, for the car, and nor for needing a bite guard as well as a filling at the dentist, so both bills were a little larger than anticipated.  On both counts, though, better to spend now than leave the issues to get worse!Yesterday we had to put our feelings to one side, and just be there for the FH's son; he was crying on the phone to me late morning as he had been told that the DNA tests done to secure the paternity of the baby have come back marked as \"inconclusive\" and his solicitor told him that that meant he is not the father of the child. I am only beginning to imagine the range of emotions he is going through, but he was absolutely devastated by the news when he was talking to me yesterday.  Words begin to fail me over this whole thing.  Silent prayer is all that I have left."},

(image from theguardian.co.uk)I can't imagine not being able to read, to escape, to investigate, to discover, to love, to laugh, to enjoy and to find out, to travel and to imagine - reading opens so many doors, it takes my breath away.  I have learned so much by being able to read, and through reading, I have discovered so many more opportunities.  I am obviously one of the lucky ones.(image from waterstones.co.uk)The EFG learned to read at school, with a lot of input from us at home, from an early age.  The YFG learned to read at home, and almost did it herself because we certainly didn't teach her in any structured way.  She didn't go to school until Year4, but she was reading well by then.  She read her first book to us one night at 11pm sitting on our bed, and she read it almost word perfectly.  I can't remember the exact book, but I know that our friends Biff and Chip from the Magic Key were up to something exciting.You don't have to be rich to be able to access books.  There are wonderful libraries in most towns, and even here, where we have libraries available eight miles in each direction, we are blessed with a library bus in the village for over an hour twice a month, just like Frugal in Suffolk regularly posts.Two things have happened this month to make me think about reading in a different light.  One was Merry's post about the reading experiences of the poorest children in the country, and the other was our Ofsted report.  The inspectors rightly recognised that parents are not having enough input into their children's reading development in some cases, and I think that that is so sad.  Spending time with a child, with a book on their lap, is such a special time, that the parent is missing out on so much as well as the child.  And, although I acknowledge what this Save the Children report has to say, I don't think that this lack is confined to the poorest children: plenty of wealthier parents still don't appreciate the impact of books and of reading in their child's life.If any of you have ever watched Strictly Come Dancing, you will have seen the ending, where the presenters link arms and say, \"Keeeeeep Dancing!\" so I would like you to imagine that tone as I implore you to \"Keeeeeeep Reading!\""},

The huge disappointment is that the FH's son was not able to tell us the truth these past few days when we have been speaking with him, and has been hiding the true depth of the child's problems from us.  The SW expressed some concern at the FH's age, although she did say that she would send us some literature and pass on our details to her manager, whilst she recommended that we research NAS on the internet, and talk together about the implications this has for our family.The time frame is very stringent, it seems, and we are already three weeks into a 26 week framework, and we will need a rigorous 12 week assessment procedure if we decide to carry on.  I am calling in every favour I can in order to find out more about NAS and to speak with old friends who have adopted. I have had time to think this morning whilst I was moving and stacking another cubic metre of wood for the fire, and then I went to the girls' school this afternoon to speak with the director of learning about how the school sets targets for the children - that was very interesting.  Their school is closed to pupils tomorrow as there is a teachers' strike, so they will be at home with me."},

We worked out a bit of a complicated way of getting everyone where they needed to be with the limitations of the vehicles available, and I toddled off to get her and brought her home.It is now 12.30pm and I haven't made a thing.I had to take the car back to the FH at 1pm, so I had a cuppa and a sit down for a minute or three.  Once he was home again, we started chopping tomatoes, apples and onions for the pickle.  It looked like this before it was cooked:I had to leave it cooking in the care of the FH and UJ whilst I went off down the village on my bike to meet a lady at chapel and get the room all set up for the Macmillan coffee morning on Friday - the lady is off to Skegness on a bus trip tomorrow so today was the only opportunity we had to get together.They managed not to burn it and I came home to a lovely pan of this:This is now in four huge jars, labelled and resting in a dark place to mature, whilst we are still eating some from 2011.Once the pickle was pickled, I was then able to deal with a request from FGS's dad to get him some info about parenting courses....that was interesting.  One lady at a children's centre launched into telling me about a course dealing with behaviour, sanctions, consequences and rewards, and I had to tell her that the child would need to grow a bit before we needed to worry about that.  Eating, sleeping and nappy changes are the only things on his agenda at the moment.  Tonight, after supper, the FH decided to cook down some apples that UJ had brought me, and I remembered Sue's post about making apple sauce in jars, and so I nabbed enough and made 7 jars of apple sauce - I wonder if Sue realises that there are people all over the blogsphere making apple sauce this week because of her inspiring post!  It does look good, and I might make more.I have now had an hour on the phone with the FGS's dad, talking with him about his plans and the courses I have found, and I still have not made a single cake today!I have plans for tomorrow....."},

UJ arrived and we had some lunch, and then just did a bit of this and that.  The YFG went off to start a job trimming a neighbour's lavender bushes and the EFG has been working on an experiment for biology with bread.  I made some chocolate brownies for lunchboxes whilst she had the oven on, and then I popped the chicken in for supper when she had finished.The roast chicken was succulent and just right with the home made crab apple jelly.  The girls made a  cake whilst I was at chapel this morning, and then iced it this afternoon, so we have sent UJ home tonight with a good chunk of it.  He will be back on Wednesday.Tonight I am going to do the minimal amount of ironing before settling down to watch Downton Abbey with my knitting.  Hope you are having a peaceful Sunday wherever you are xx"},

{"title": "And for our next challenge...", "date": "Tuesday 17 September 2013", "text": "You've read about the kind of year the FH has been having.  You know how many times he has been admitted to hospital, and the upheavals we have been through.  You have supported and encouraged, uplifted and upheld us through it all.  Thank you. In conjunction with the local surgery, we have been monitoring the PSA marker in his blood; this is all about prostate cancer now.  The marker was high a year or more ago, and we saw a specialist, and decided to go for watchful waiting as a pathway.  This has involved regular monitoring of the PSA through blood tests.  The PSA has been rising, slowly, and the latest has risen quite drastically. It doesn't mean that he HAS prostate cancer.   We have to think and pray carefully now, and be very sure of what WE want before we allow the doctors to force him into a pathway that he may not want to take.  We have talked with our GP about the outcomes in the past, and the specialist was realistic with the FH's medical history, saying that he would be reluctant to treat it if it was cancer because of the impact the treatment might have on his health.  He has no symptoms at all - the marker in the blood is the only indication, so there is no impact on his lifestyle whatsoever at the present time. I am clear in my own mind about what I do not want:  I do not want him mucked about with, poked, prodded and cut.  I don't want a load of medication prescribed to treat something that may not be life threatening if those medications impact on the medications which keep him alive.  I do not want his quality of life as it is now to deteriorate, for something that might not be a real threat to life.  As the specialist said last year, plenty of old men die WITH prostate cancer, without actually dying FROM it.  He has to think about the biopsy, as that carries a significant risk for someone like him.  Does he really want to know, if there is no treatment available anyway? The FH needs to consider what he wants now, and we all need to respect that.  That is what is important, and I will be right behind him, whatever path he chooses.  I need you guys behind me."},
{"title": "Crab apples and stuff", "date": "Monday 16 September 2013", "text": "The crab apples are cooked and the juice is dripping from the pulp in the jelly straining bag on the counter.  The last time I looked, the stream had slowed and we had just over a litre of juice.  I'll leave it overnight and boil it up with sugar to make the jelly in the morning.  I love crab apple jelly so I am quite excited about it!  The only downside is that you can have a huge heap of apples, and it doesn't make that much jelly...I didn't get the apple chutney made as I was busy with other things.  I had a once-in-a-decade cleaning of my shower - yes, that is disgusting, I know, as it means that I have never cleaned it quite this thoroughly before!  Sorry - this was extremely thorough and involved taking the doors off, and bringing them downstairs to really attack them.  I cleaned the soap and limescale off the doors and screens with a very frugal cleaning stuff - malt vinegar!  It did a really grand job.  The shower looks very clean now, but it did take me the best part of two hours.......In the middle of it all, I dashed off to pick up the girls because their bus broke down.  Not helpful but not to worry - it is a good service and gets them there and home again 99% of the school days each year. I have also done more washing today, but I hung it out under the verandah as we have had huge black clouds looming here more than once today.  Most of it is dry now.  The washing I have done today, and at the weekend, has been done with a new Ariel liquitab that I was sent by the BzzAgent people.  It is fine, and smells great, but I wouldn't actually buy it myself.  They gave us enough for 11 washes, but I checked it out in the supermarkets.  A box of 19 was £3.50 in Sainsbury's but £4.50 in Tesco.  Strangely, a box of 38 in Sainsbury's leaps up to £12+ which is very strange and not at all sensible.  I'll stick with my big blue boxes of Persil - I am monitoring it and I do have about a year's supply stashed away at £6 a box - and that does me more than 50 washes.  I shall be mentioning the price when I give them feedback.The cocoa-based recipe I have used for a while came from The Stone Soup blog here and you will find the recipe further down her post through that link.The YFG wanted to try a different recipe this week, and we did use one which involved melting real chocolate, but since it called for only 50g, I gave it a go - twice!  They came out really well the first time, but got slightly overcooked the second time, last night, because I popped the pan in the oven after I cooked the lamb for our tea, and then I went to eat, and slightly [totally!] forgot about them!  They are still very edible, but they rose and then sank again, so they are quite squishy.  It hasn't been a problem for the YFG who is still enjoying them...The recipe came from a handy little recipe magazine called My Favourite Recipes, which is a reader-recipe collection which comes out monthly and costs just £1 so I do buy it occasionally.This is how we did it:I lined a 23cm square tin, and preheated the oven to 160C as it is a fan oven.Then we melted 50g dark chocolate, broken into squares, with 120g baking margerine, in a Pyrex dish over a pan of simmering water, stirring it occasionally.  We used Lidl's chocolate, at about 30p or less for a bar, so this cost about 15p for the chocolate.  Not bad!Once that had melted properly, we stirred it into the dry ingredients: 225g granulated sugar, 50g plain flour, and 1tsp baking powder.  We also added two beaten eggs at this stage.  The recipe now calls for 120g chopped almonds, but these are rather pricey and I almost never buy them, so we didn't have any in the cupboard.  What we did have are the more affordable Chopped Mixed Nuts, which have a high proportion of peanuts, but there are still almonds in the mix.  So we added about 100g of chopped mixed nuts, and they distributed themselves throughout the cake.Poured into the square tin, this took about 20 minutes to cook, but we wanted it to be only just cooked for that magical brownie consistency, so the first batch was better than the second because it was cooked more precisely!If we have no chocolate in the house, the Stone Soup recipe is fabulous, but if there is just 50g of dark chocolate to be had, the YFG says that the second recipe is her favourite.  It could, of course, be made without the nuts, and with other additions.I used to use this recipe for Weetabix brownies a lot, but I buy a lot less Weetabix these days as the family seem to have gone off them!  It is definitely one way of getting healthier cakes into people without a big taste difference.So that is my collection of tried-and-trusted Brownie recipes.  Good luck if you try any of them x"},

Another little boost to the savings and more books off the shelves in the garage - I am determined to get rid of them all this year!I have done the Davina DVD for four days in a row, and can't hardly get up from sitting down from all the squats, but I have survived - one more day and then two days off - can't wait!Hope you have all had a blessed day one way or the other.  See you tomorrow, and thank you for all the comments lately: it is lovely to hear from you when you have got time to say Hello xx"},

Shock, horror - really don't like the sound of that, so I think I may have to have the bite-plate.  Apparently it is like a gum shield that hockey players wear, but fitted specifically to my mouth after they take impressions.I have a while to organise the finances for that as the next appointment for a filling is not until the 10th October.  Hope you are all having a good week so far xxI have been in touch with Silver Sewer today and she is fine. Unfortunately the trolls are back in her comment box, and she is going to enjoy her holiday before she decides what to do.  I know she will be missed, but she and her husband are fine and that is what matters."},

This afternoon I have been busy in the garden, cutting back and trimming the triffids which my tomato plants had become, so that with the stalks a little more bare, the sun can get to the tomatoes, and hopefully they will ripen more quickly.  I picked those that were ripe and they are delicious.  Today's the day I harvested our first tomatoes of the season here.  I also cut the back lawn which was a job in itself as it had got rather overgrown, but the chooks certainly enjoyed scratching in the cuttings, which I shared amongst the yards. This evening I have used the last of yesterday's turkey dinner to make an Asian Turkey Noodle soup for the folks for their supper.  It was a good recipe which could be adapted to make the most of what I had available.  Leftover turkey, AF soft noodles, a carrot, a red pepper from the greenhouse, half an onion, and a piece of ginger left from chutney making, all boiled up together in some vegetable stock."},
{"title": "108 days", "date": "Saturday 7 September 2013", "text": "108 days to You Know What.....I mentioned it yesterday, but today I have been through our finances again more closely and worked out what needs to be achieved by the end of the year - and it isn't a pretty sight!  Our savings plan has had some serious hurdles to cover this year and it is beginning to look like one or two of the fences might just be too much for it.  Christmas could be a seriously expensive time, for all and sundry, if we don't take control and make some decisions, probably very soon!  Frugal Queen has had a post this weekend with some brilliant ideas, so do hop over there and have a look at her strategies for success and sanity.What will we do here in the Fens?  I've had a little while to think about some of our areas of expense, and how to deal with them sensibly.Christmas CardsI still have a serious stash of cards from past years, and so there will be no spending on actual cards.  Many modern and technologically-savvy friends won't mind a wave on Facebook or an email, but I will be hand-delivering cards to older friends in the village and the local towns when we are out and about.  Getting the cards written early enough means that we can deliver them without making a special trip.  One or two special people will get letters instead of cards and perhaps a few photos as well.  These are people who live further afield and whom we don't see in person from one year to the next, unfortunately.Christmas Pudding(image from bbcgoodfood.com)I made two of these last year, so this is covered already.  It will be very well matured!  I may not make brandy butter this year, as some people [!!] seemed to use the pudding merely as a vehicle to get the brandy butter into their mouths in rather large portions, so perhaps a nice orange-zest/juice flavoured butter would go down nicely with the pud this year.Christmas CakeIt is only the FH and UJ who will eat this, so it will be a small, home made one.  This will get made in October half-term to give it time to develop the flavours.  I have been using the same recipe since 2000, so it is a good one, which the FH and UJ both love.Christmas Dinner(image from goodtoknow.co.uk)The Aldi Three-Bird Roast went down very well last year, so that will probably be on the menu again this year.  It cost £9.99, and it would be handy if they kept the price the same!  The vegetables will be fresh or frozen, the Yorkshire pud will be home made, and the stuffing, courtesy of AF, is already in the store cupboard.  I always buy the crackers in the sales in January so they are tucked away in the garage.Home made treatsI do make mince pies in rather large quantities, but they always get eaten by the family and the guests who pop in, and the congregation at the chapel when I take them along there.  The ingredients are not terribly expensive, and I have dried fruit in stock for the making of the mincemeat.  A good sponge will keep those who hate dried fruit happy, and a couple of tubes of own-brand \"Pringle\"-type crisps with a home made dip will be great for evening munchies over the festive period.  We have lots of pickles in stock, and with the addition of the normal cheese ration, the FH will have a good supper now and again.Gifts(image from telegraph.co.uk)We have collectively decided that there will be fewer gifts given outside the family as the children we have been giving them to are growing up and are more and more difficult to buy things for because we never actually see them!  There are about 6 local children who will receive gifts, and a couple of cyber-friends to whom I love to send small items.  The older local children might receive hat and scarf sets as I have lots of wool in stock!  I do like to show my appreciation to the teachers at the village school, and last year made them the mock Ferrero-Rocheresque sweets, so they may well get those again. They are very economical to make, too.  I also have several tins of condensed milk ready for the fudge making.The girlsI have already begun to stash away small items for their stockings, and I will be waiting for their suggestion lists to come forward in about six weeks' time.  The lovely thing is that they know that the season is about more than gifts, and know not to be greedy in their list-making.  The YFG has had a tablet for her birthday and understands that she will not get anything as valuable as that in December.  The EFG also realises that she will be needing items like a new laptop when she goes away to uni next autumn, so it would be daft to be spending out on things like that now - her laptop is getting on now, but I am hoping it has another year in it!The treeOur tree will make it through another year!  Remembering that Christmas for us is about Christ is one thing, but knowing that it doesn't hold that meaning for everyone, it should still be more about relationships, spending time with friends and relatives and taking time to recharge the batteries than it is about spending money.  We can have a good time without bankrupting ourselves for the rest of the year. You will be spared further posts on this until December as you now know our plans!  Anyone wanting any of the recipes I have mentioned, just ask and I will link you up with them - they are all here in previous year's posts.40 tips for September over here at Frugaldom - fabulous post - some of these will also help with the Christmas spending."},
{"title": "Big clutterbusting success", "date": "Friday 6 September 2013", "text": "We moved the clutterbusting up a level today and actually got paid for some of the stuff we moved on!  The FH noticed an ad in the paper from someone offering to buy older items [I hesitate to say antiques, because they weren't!] and she was here with her husband and a small wad of cash within two hours. We moved on some old Sindy furniture, some of it still boxed up, from my long-ago childhood, which has been boxed up here for years.  We released some other things so that new people can enjoy them, I keep telling myself!  All in all, I estimate we busted at least 50 items out of here today, and we made some space!It is better to get things moving so that space can be made in one's life for new \"things\" - not necessarily items, but perhaps experiences and opportunities.  I have realised that I have been hanging on to things for the wrong reasons, and this clutterbusting that I have been doing in August and September has really changed my outlook.  I have to let go, and let new chances come along.....someone said today that we have 110 days to Christmas [I did hear another person say 109, but who's really counting yet?!] so we have only a few more until 2014, and who knows what that will bring?  This autumn is already shaping up to be challenging, interesting and good fun."},

Coming back later with some thoughts on the other resolutions for the month, and a meal plan for the coming week.  See you later - hope you are also having some good weather, wherever you are xx"},
{"title": "Peace and serenity", "date": "Wednesday 4 September 2013", "text": "I hope these pictures can give you some idea of the peace, tranquility and relaxing nature of the situation of the caravan in the woods at Kelling Heath.  The caravan stands opposite this conservation pond, which was actually a gravel pit when I first went there as a child, and we had a swing over the pit from the big horse chestnut tree you can see further down the post.Much of the area is left to grow wild, and paths are cut through for walkers.This is the tree from the far side of the pond, with my back to the mature woodland and the caravans in the roadway opposite.This is the tree from the caravan side.  We used it as a playground, climbing in the branches, about 30 years ago!UFO?  Thought this cloud formation was worthy of a photo....That's the caravan in the background.  It's up for sale, and will be pulled off that site at the end of the year.  Feels sad, the end of an era, the loss of another connection with my mum.  Four generations of our family have stayed on this particular pitch since my parents bought the first van there when I was 9.......Another very similar shot.  We dropped the FH off at Sheringham Station at about 10.35am, and it was already busy.  He went up the line to Holt, the terminus, and back three times by 2.45pm and had a good day of it.  He took a packed lunch and a drink.This is the front of the train, as the chaps were turning it around for the next journey.  The train came into Sheringham with the engine the \"wrong\" way around!The stations on the North Norfolk Railway are quite picturesque and I believe that Weybourne in particular has been used in several dramatisations for tv and film.A jolly good day, the FH pronounced it!More photos from Felbrigg - I couldn't resist taking a picture of this gleaming copper in the kitchen: it must keep someone busy to make it shine like this!Below is the Orangery.  When we went inside, it isn't as big as it looks and the walls are painted white, we think to reflect the light onto the plants, but unfortunately, it also shows the damp rising and the mould. It is a dramatic and south facing building, but looks as if it could do with some tlc.This is the stable block, where the gift shop, cafe and loos are situated.  There is also a holiday flat in this area - the window slap bang in the middle of the photo is a room in the holiday flat.  Wouldn't it be lovely to stay here and be able to roam the gardens in the evenings when all the visitors have left?We hadn't seen a bath like this before, but the guide told us it was a slipper bath.  Not found at the property but of the same era, and used to make the room look like a dressing room, which was its last use.This room made me think of Downton Abbey - this is the servants' hall.  The shine on those tables was quite something - they are very well polished!This was hanging to the side of the AGA in the kitchen - it looks like a fancy spatula, and I was interested by the fancy decoration on it.Those are the best photos from Felbrigg.  Coming up next, the trains!"},

{"title": "Norfolk days", "date": "Sunday 1 September 2013", "text": "I am going to take the service this morning whilst the girls get their bags repacked, and then we are off to Norfolk for two nights, staying at Kelling Heath, not far from Sheringham, Holt and Cromer on the north Norfolk coast.  Arriving there this afternoon, we will have a time of relaxing, unpacking and perhaps walking, and then a peaceful evening with books, knitting and a DVD.  Tomorrow we plan to visit Felbrigg Hall, and then we will come home on Tuesday.  Have a good Sunday xxLet's just have a brief report on the August Challenge before we launch into September's!  August's was all about clearing clutter and unwanted items out of the house.  I was able to share what an excellent week I had to begin with, and then I neglected to share any more.  Actually, clearing clutter is just not that interesting, I thought....it involved sorting through things, bagging them up and lugging them into the town to one or other of the charity shops.  I varied which shops I donated to, which did depend on where I could get a parking space some of the time, as I was unloading heaps of bags.  It was a very therapeutic month, and parts of the house feel much less cluttered and much tidier.  Others still have a way to go, but we will continue with the plan and see how far we can get by Christmas.  We may slow down a little from 100 items a week as I am going to have to bite the bullet now and start listing some of the things on eBay - I have avoided that this month and mostly donated them or just given them away to people.And so for September.  I have decided that I will join in with the challenge in the Frugaldom Forum for September to get back to basics with money saving - I always look at September as a new beginning and it does seem that this will be a good time to recharge my batteries and refresh my inner frugaler!  I did think twice about participating in this, but I thought that the support of others on the board would encourage me.  We have just ordered oil for the central heating, and a dent of just over £500 has been put in the finances, as well as recovering from the holiday expenses and the birthday expenses which all came together in August.  September needs to get back on track in a big way!"},
{"title": "They're home!", "date": "Saturday 31 August 2013", "text": "We heard from them at about 1.45pm and soon scuttled off to Cambridge to meet the bus from Southampton for 3.20pm; it was just about on schedule and we didn't have long to wait.  They had had a good journey, and were pleased to see us!These are some of the photos that the EFG has taken; the YFG has also got a camera full of pictures, but she turned her computer off before I could ask for a few.  Maybe we'll get some of hers tomorrow.It seems amazing how close the ship got to the land in places, but their ship was one of the smaller ones on the circuit this time - the Royal Caribbean's \"Vision of the Seas\" kept cropping up in the same ports and totally dwarfed their vessel. The whole country looks immaculate - so clean and green!  The EFG remarked on the lack of litter bins, but said that there was no rubbish anywhere at all.This is possibly the EFG's best shot of the holiday and I absolutely love it!  I have two Lakeland vouchers which I am happy to pass on, as they have been in magazines I have had as treats this week!Each one is for £5 when you spend £30, and they are both valid until 14th October.If anyone would like one, please leave me a comment saying, \"Yes please\" and send your address in a separate comment which won't be published, and they will be winging their way to you early next week.Hope this helps someone, as Lakeland do sell an amazing array of useful stuff in amongst all the items that are perhaps less essential!We have thought about the week, reflected upon it separately and together and come to some interesting conclusions.  Some of them did not become absolutely clear to me until last night, when the girls rang us, as their mobile phones had begun to work again as they were close to the UK coastline. We have missed their physical presence, their chatter and their liveliness about the house; we miss their news, being part of their lives and being with them in the day-to-day.  On the other hand, we have enjoyed the rare time to ourselves.  It has been a change, but not one I would like to continue for longer than a week! We are going to be able to wean ourselves off their presence gradually over time, and that is as it should be.  As they become more independent, and move more fully into their own lives, we will be forced to re-think our own to some extent. However, I have had a revelation about my stress levels and it has indeed come as something of a shock to me: when I am here with only someone who has physical difficulties [the FH], I don't mind doing everything and I am glad of whatever he feels able to do to help*.  When the girls are here, and I am trying to get 101 things done, I feel frustrated that they don't see that I could do with some help, and that raises my stress levels somewhat.  I get cross with the arguing and the reluctance to help and to contribute that I see in them, and that makes me angry with myself that I haven't trained them better! Our eyes have been opened this week, and I see that we could have a more relaxed way of life if more hands were lifted to contribute, and it seems that September brings a new beginning, and one that we should take advantage of in more ways than one. *[The way that the FH helps is sometimes a blessing and other times a challenge.  Yesterday he offered to help with the chutney making, and said he would skin the tomatoes and peel the onions.  The tomatoes were fine but when he peeled the onions, he did 2.5kg instead of 2.5lbs, which is quite a difference, so I have frozen the excess in two-onion portions.]"},

How time flies!Tonight I am making more courgette chutney and preparing the service for Sunday.  Multi-tasking a little as the chutney has to simmer for two hours, with just the occasional stir.  See you tomorrow xx"},
{"title": "Use it up banana flapjack", "date": "Thursday 29 August 2013", "text": "The bandwagon must be pretty full at the moment, with all those who have jumped on it to declare that we should use up our leftovers, prepare budget recipes, not waste food......don't they realise that some of that is just not new any more and that hundreds of thousands of people have been doing just that for generations? As for Jamie Oliver's new book, from what he said on The One Show tonight, it sounds just like a rehash of Economy Gastronomy which Allegra McEvedy and Paul Merrill did a few years ago now.  He said that most of his recipes cost no more than £1.30 per portion.  Compare that with the pennies that Jack Monroe costs out her recipes, or Frugaldom's blog, where she aims to feed herself and her house mates for about £1 a day or just slightly more, and you can see why the celebrity chefs have a way to go to get into their league.We had a lovely supper tonight with only the sausages not produced here.  Roast potatoes, fresh runner beans and fried courgettes with sausages.  Just perfect for the two of us.  No leftovers either! Our time is taken up with preserving our bounty at the moment - we have been gifted a large quantity of plums today and so we had to stone them, and then I stewed them before preparing them for the freezer.  The other option would have been to jam them, but we have years' worth of jam in the cupboard and no need to make more right now.  The FH loves stewed fruit with custard, so that will keep him happy through the winter.  We bought some tomatoes from a roadside stall today - nearly 5lbs of them for just £1.50, and so I can make more courgette chutney this weekend.  We have everything else that we need in the garden or store cupboard.  There is a lovely lady at the Craft Club at chapel who told me that she loves marrows so whenever I find an overgrown courgette in the patch which is masquerading as a marrow, it ends up on her doorstep.  She keeps wanting to pay me for the blinking things, and I just have to keep repeating that she is doing me a favour in taking them off my hands!My own use-it-up recipe for the day was a banana flapjack which was posted on MSE forum today.  I had two bananas which were ready to flow out of their skins, so ripe were they, and so it seemed a useful alternative to the usual banana cake!  The recipe is here, and it worked really well, the FH declaring it \"rather good!\"  I will be adding that to my repertoire of cakes and bakes for sure."},

UJ is staying another night so that he is here for the lunch meeting tomorrow which is the regular Wednesday date for the chaps.  They are not going out this week and so I am cooking roast chook, Yorkshire puds, stuffing and loads of veg, followed by rhubarb pie and ice cream, for five.  They will eat at lunchtime, and then I will have time in the afternoon to clear up and get organised again, before I go to the doctor to see about my eye problems.....slightly concerned about that, but hopefully all will be well.The most exciting event of the day - we had a phone call from the girls this evening!  They are in Olden, about to sail for Geiranger, I think, and they are having a great time, as we knew that they would.  The phone cut out in the middle of the YFG's turn at talking, so that was a little tricky, but it was great to hear from them.  Thanks for all your good wishes, and encouragement, folks!"},

Now I will match in the winter.And the girls.  Well, I am sure that they are having a fab-u-lous [Strictly is back soon!] time on the ship, but the FH is driving me mad asking if there is anything on the computer from them - have they sent any emails, have they been on Facebook?  No, they are too busy enjoying themselves, as it should be!  But it is nice to know he is thinking about them, as am I, but I will be glad, for his sake, if they do email at least once later in the week.  They should dock in Stavanger in the morning, and have some time there.The Bank Holiday is beckoning tomorrow - I am visiting a friend in the morning, the FH is going to the bees in the afternoon, and then we are off to UJ's house in the evening in preparation for an early appointment at Papworth on Tuesday morning.  I will be sorting out a bed for UJ here and doing some general tidying up before we go, including a heap of ironing!  What's the betting it will rain at some point?  Wouldn't be a British bank holiday if it didn't, although I think the forecast is generally fine for the week ahead."},

Have got to take the tv back to Argos tomorrow, I think - we watched a dvd tonight and the sound and vision don't synch together properly when watching a dvd so the words people say don't fit with the movement of their mouths - it gets really annoying.  The tv section is fine, but I can't watch more dvds like this, so we will have to get another one!  Pain in the you-know-where, too, just when I have a lot on.....never mind!Better get to sleep - early appointment tomorrow xKim asked for the link to the beetroot pickle recipe - it is HERE.  Hope you like it!"},

{"title": "Happy chaps", "date": "Tuesday 20 August 2013", "text": "I finally got around to buying the new tv with integral DVD player this afternoon, so the family are pleased with me for that.  I hummed and hawed about it for some time, not sure what to get, nor how big or how much to spend, but in the end, after careful consideration, I spent £199.99 at Argos, and got them one ever so slightly bigger than the one we had in the sitting room previously - I think there is about an inch in it!  Anyway, peace will be restored to those wanting to watch tv now.  And they can stop hassling me......Hassles abound at the moment, I am afraid - I was hoping to be able to get some work done in school over the holidays but the person who was supposed to facilitate that for me [ie give me the information I needed to do the job] went on holiday without giving me it, and has now come back but we have only this week with access to school before the caretaker is on holiday next week and we can't get in, so I am not going to get the job done and the system will not be ready for the children to start to use in September - I am feeling quite frustrated about this, unfortunately.The days are running out before the girls' holiday, and things are needing to get washed and ironed and packed in the cases - and they keep wearing things and then saying, \"You can wash this before Friday, can't you!\" so I have had to have strict words with them in a way and say NO!  If you want things washing, tomorrow is the last day, and just keep the stuff clean that you want to take away so just wear old stuff for now!  Because we are all going away to the coast as soon as they get back, we need to have all their school items ready as well before they go to Norway.  Anyway, I have taken them for the last shop today and we have got tights and oddments, and I have ordered them some Norwegian currency from the Post Office in the village which I need to pick up tomorrow.  Not a lot, mind you, just enough for an ice cream, perhaps, or a drink and a sandwich, and a postcard or a souvenir of some small variety when they visit the various stops on the way.I think we are all feeling a little bit nervous this week as Saturday approaches.  The EFG seems fine about it all but the YFG is definitely a bit edgy, just as she was years ago when it was me going away for four nights! Apart from the FH being in hospital, we have never been apart like this for a week before, and it is slightly unnerving.  I am confident that my Dad will take good care of them and that they will be safe with him, but I am still unsettled by the fact of not seeing them for a whole week, and only being in touch probably by email.  I know I am being a bit daft, and I have to get used to the idea with the EFG looking at universities, for goodness' sake, but there is always a first time, and this is it!  By 9am on Saturday morning when I wave them off in Cambridge, I may be a nervous wreck......."},
{"title": "Glam on the cheap", "date": "Monday 19 August 2013", "text": "We have had a fabulous afternoon at my sister's house, trying on posh frocks!  The girls are very different sizes in that the YFG is a 10/12 whereas the EFG is closer to an 18, but amazingly enough, my sister has clothes to fit them both, courtesy of her own yo-yoing weightloss journey.  She raided her wardrobe, and brought clothes down from the loft, so they both had a good selection to choose from, all laid out on her spare bed.  There were High Street designers like Laura Ashley, and others I had never heard of, and many items still as new with the tags on them.  The EFG has brought home three lovely dresses which she plans to wear on the cruise, two evening styles and one day time outfit; the YFG had slightly more to choose from but found less of it her to her taste, which is understandable when you consider that she is 14 and my sister is nearly 40!  But many classic styles did look gorgeous on her and she particularly liked a silk dress that was over £100 new - my sister wore it in Goa years ago and had a copy made there too, which we have also borrowed.  I have told them to eat \"clean\" food when they are at the dinner table - no tomato sauces down these frocks, please!I am conscious that I shall be relying on the girls to take photos whilst they are away, so I am very tempted to take some photos of them in the dresses before they go - there is a beautiful one that the EFG has borrowed in a teal/blue colour which suits her particularly well and she never wears dresses usually so I want photographic evidence of how good she can look in a frock!We are very grateful to my sister for her generosity in offering to lend the girls these outfits, it goes without saying."},

{"title": "R & R today", "date": "Saturday 17 August 2013", "text": "Being back at the chapel for just after 8 this morning meant quite an early start.  The night shift ladies had mostly gone home for a shower and change of clothes before they gathered again at 10am for breakfast at the cafe so the 8-10am shift was quiet, and the EFG came along with me and did some knitting on a hat she is trying out.  Some were doing the jigsaw, others chatted and we all sat companionably together.  Peace.I must just tell you about E, who is an amazing lady of 80.  She was at the chapel from 9.30am yesterday morning, until 9.15am this morning, without a break!  She did go home for a quick bath before breakfast, but then she shared with me that she would just have time for a short nap this afternoon as she was going out this evening to a show!  I have no idea what vitamins or pills she might be on, but I think I need some of what she has....At the earliest count, we seem to have raised around £200 so far, but it may come to more as people hand in their donations.  We definitely have the £75 for the sending of the boxes, and we have plenty left over to buy the bits and pieces, and probably will be able to make a decent donation of the leftover cash to the chapel as we did last year. Once home from the chapel at about 10.45am, I had a sit down and a chat with the FH, and then I went to the town as the girls had birthday cheques to put in the bank, I had to pick up the tiles for the fireplace that we ordered last week, and I needed a few bits of shopping.After lunch, I settled down with the FH to watch the athletics from Moscow this afternoon, and actually watched some of it, before I had quite a snooze!  I managed to wake up long enough to cook the supper, but this evening has been another restful one, with me just adding more rows to my scarf knitting for the boxes.  I haven't been terribly active at all today, but I think a quieter day and a more restful one was on the cards."},

I spent my shifts knitting a scarf to put in a child's box: it isn't finished yet, but I am quite pleased with it as it is a scaled down version of the one I knitted for myself and for my Dad last Christmas time.  I have also found a use for the left over IKEA fleece blankets which I bought the other year for curtain linings - one of the ladies and I are going to cut them up with pinking shears and make more children's scarves from them.  They only cost £1.60 each and we reckon we might get 5 or 6 scarves from each one - bargain!  They will also fold up small for the boxes too.Haven't spent much time at home today at all, as you can guess, so full marks to the girls for doing their chores and helping out.  Each has also spent one shift at the chapel with me, so I was grateful for their company and support there too.  I wouldn't have been able to get out in the garden anyway today as we have had so much rain - it has really bucketed it down here today!"},

Whatever she has achieved, we will be very proud of her for all the hard work she has put in, and I am sure that she will go on and work just as hard this coming year.  I'll let you know tomorrow.....I am slightly nervous on her behalf - I just hope for her sake that the marks reflect how hard she has worked.  I've been told I have to wait in the car whilst she goes in for the envelope."},

I do remember calling the FH in his hospital and telling him that the YFG was on the way and that we were off, so when I rang him back just after 1pm, there were cheers in the background as he came to the phone to hear that he had another daughter.  He was very pleased! The YFG was born on a Friday, and my sister came up on the train to be with us on the Saturday, and then the Glasgow hospital decided to release the FH on the Monday, so we didn't have a lot of time to get over the birth, before I had an invalid to care for as well as a newborn.  I remember one of my friends telling me that I would be able to get a home help for a few weeks, given the situation, so I rang the health visitor to see how I went about arranging it.  \"What makes you think that you would get a home help?\" she said, in a rather dour Scottish voice, so I replied, rather meekly, \"Well, my husband is coming out of hospital today after having a heart transplant and I just delivered a baby on Friday....\" to which she gushed, \"Oh, my dear, of course you must have one!\" which was quite a relief, and we had the amazing Nora for 6 weeks then.And here we are 14 years later.  The FH is still going strong albeit with his ups and downs, and the YFG and EFG are such lovely young women that we are so proud of.They are all still asleep so I had better waken them as we are going for a day out today at 10, and they have showers to get, lunches to pack and the sitting room to repair after the sleepover last night - there are sleeping bags and quilts all over!!  Hope to be back later with some photos."},

He has lived and been loved, and what more could one ask?It's been a bit of a day, with one thing and another.  We found him this morning and then had to go to church for an hour, after which we popped him in the boot of my car and went to UJ's house, where we buried him at the top of the garden, near the rhubarb, to the left of one of the big compost heaps, in a quiet space where he won't be disturbed.Having done that, we picked the EFG up from her friend's house, where she had stayed overnight, and came home via my sister's as she had asked me to pop in for the girls' birthday cards.  This afternoon, we have had some visitors, and popped round to see a neighbour who had visited Cupar on her holidays - she had taken some photos of the old houses in Cupar where we used to live, so we had to look at those.  Bit disappointing on both counts as neither of the houses can now be seen clearly from the road! I left it too late to cook the beef for supper, so I cooked it anyway and it will now be tomorrow's supper.  Tonight they had a vegetarian spaghetti bake from the free Sainsbug's leaflet about Eating Well for Less which I picked up when we were in there recently.  I had all the ingredients in the house, so it was a matter of a few minutes to get it ready and pop it in the oven [which was already on for the beef].  All of the family said it was nice, so that is another meal to add to the repertoire, although I think I would add more veggies to it in future. The FH's cousin and his wife appeared at the door just as I was about to serve it, so they came in and had a cup of tea with us; they had come over from Peterborough to bring the girls' birthday cards.  Having the birthdays just 8 days apart makes it quite convenient for everyone to remember!Tonight we have watched the penultimate \"The White Queen\" and I am about to go to bed with a good book.Lancelot [approx 2007/8 - 2013]Our favourite cockerel, Lancelot, died this morning.  He had become the rather stately older gentleman of the flock in the latter months of his life, and was attacked by another cockerel which he had been quite happily living with in the flock with the hens.  This left him quite traumatised, so he and a couple of his wives moved house.  He seemed to recover, but we noticed some weakness developing lately, and sure enough, he passed on today.  He will be much missed, as he was such a character, and very well loved.  He came to us in the prime of his life, aged about 2 or 3, so I hope he enjoyed his \"twilight\" years with us and his ladies."},
{"title": "Back to the pantry", "date": "Saturday 10 August 2013", "text": "Time to share my pantry shopping methods again, I think, as I can see as clearly as the next person, that prices in the shops are rising stupidly.  90p for a can of tuna, £1.50 for a litre of cooking oil?  These are only two examples of things that I have recently NOT bought in a supermarket, although they have been on my list, because of the price.  Hearing that Froogs has bought sugar at 88p a bag or thereabouts made me quake at paying over a £1 for a bag.And so, this week, I have been doing it with more thought, and continuing in our normal practice, which is a different approach from what \"most\" people do.  The general population, I believe, seems to go to the shop and buy what they think the family needs for the forthcoming week.  They may have planned their menu for the week ahead, they may not have done.  Those who have some kind of plan may be slightly in front of those without.Some of us are different.  (image from approvedfood.co.uk)We buy things in bulk from Approved Food because we know a bargain when we see one, and we know that we can find a use, and save some money, by buying an item there.  I never go to the AF website with a list of what I want - because they won't have it in stock.  'Tis always best to browse through the site, see what they have, what we use, and then edit the basket quite aggressively before checking out, I find!We also buy more than one of something when we see it at a good price.  Oil at £1.25/litre?  I'll take three.  Tuna at less than 70p a can?  I'll stock up with four, please.  Sugar at 89p a bag? I'll pick up four this week and come back for more another week if there is still some in stock.After posting earlier in the month about feeling the need to begin to get the stocks in again for the winter, I went through my cupboards with a notepad and pen, and made a list of stuff that I knew we needed, and it is all stuff we use regularly.  Then, as I have been out and about with the girls, passing that shop here and this one there, I have popped in to see what the prices are like.  Oil in the major supermarkets is too expensive, but I passed an Aldi this afternoon, and found it cheaper there.  Tuna has risen to giddy heights in some supermarkets, but Morrison's had a good deal on it last week, and Aldi has also got it at a good price today, so I have about 8 tins in the cupboards now.  (image from dailymail.co.uk)It is also about knowing your prices, knowing a figure in your head of what you are prepared to pay for that item, and sticking to it.  It is also a matter of not making specific trips to buy particular items, but buying a little stash when you are passing somewhere that has a good deal on that item.  I probably won't get back to the sugar shop for a week or ten days, until I go back to that area - I have had to order in tiles for the fireplace for the repairs of the lightning damage, so when I go back to pick them up, I may take the opportunity to check the sugar situation again.  We use sugar for preserving and baking, and it doesn't go out of date, so it is no ill store, as my mother would have said.And so meal planning is different.  We don't plan according to what we see in the shops this week, or even what we fancy from the shops, but according to what we have in the pantry, which has been bought at the best possible prices, and saves us the most pennies on our food bill.  I'm using the word \"pantry\" here in the widest sense, because at this time of the year, it would mean food in the cupboards, the stores, the freezers, growing in the garden, and what I have also been given!  Shopping is a matter of keeping the stores replenished, storage is about rotating the stores and making sure that the oldest items are used up first, and it all stretches the food budget."},

Tonight, rather late, I am making some beetroot chutney.  It should be finished about midnight....the FH helped me by grating the beetroot, peeling and chopping the carrots, and doing the onions, which made him cry!  All I have to do is cook and bottle it.  It is a very rich ruby red tonight, and hopefully I will be able to share some pictures of it for you tomorrow - and the recipe.

{"title": "Shopping bargains again", "date": "Tuesday 6 August 2013", "text": "Yesterday we had a delivery from Approved Food, and it was unpacked from the boxes and on the shelves in the store cupboards before you could say, \"Winter's coming!\"  I do feel more prepared for winter when I know I have a good stock of sensible and usable food in the stores.  It also applies to chicken food, rabbit food and cat food - I don't forget the animals!According to my receipt, the RRP of my parcel contents yesterday would have been £103.87 but I paid just £41.46, which included £5.25 for delivery.Not a lot of what I bought was strictly necessary, I will be honest!  The 500g spaghetti packs at 50p each are very useful, and the large tubs of Smash at £1 each will come in very handy later on when we have eaten all the new potatoes, and I want to make shepherd's pie or fish pie.  The large Tomato ketchup squeezy bottles at £1 each were also a bargain.  But the rest?  There were some carrot cake mixes, ginger cake mixes, chocolate malt balls for decorations, red cabbage in vinegar [6 large jars at 60p each], shortbread, ginger nuts, Crunchy Nut cereals, and assorted chocolate.  I use the mixes to quickly and cheaply make cakes for the various events at the chapel each week - with a carrot cake mix costing just 25p and all I have to add are a couple of eggs and a little marg, I can't really do it that cheaply from scratch.  The FH loves the red cabbage.  We have grown it in the past but not here successfully, and the last place he bought it was from a lady in the village charging over a £1 a jar, so he was thrilled to see me unpacking these six jars for him.  And the chocolate?  Well, in the middle of the winter, when there is ice on the roads and maybe snow on the ground, do you think that the girls are going to be begging me for cheese, bread, or soup?  No, the treats are also a very necessary part of preparing for whatever the weather will throw at us this year!"},

{"title": "Value range shopping", "date": "Saturday 3 August 2013", "text": "I went to Asda today to find some school shirts for the YFG and to do our bit for our most local food bank.(image from telegraph.co.uk) I pushed a trolley around the store, and inserted a basket into it, so I put the donations in the basket for ease of packing them separately at the checkout.  I have to say that I was very pleased to have a chat with one of the volunteers, who told me that there is a new food bank in the process of being opened in the town closer to us.  The one I donated to today is just for the folk of that northern Fen town.  This does seem to be a little issue with the food banks in that they perhaps only support the people of the town that they are in, whereas their donations may come from further afield, but they would be challenged to support all the little villages like us as well.  But we are probably too small to run our own........catch 22 I think.(image from trusseltrust.org)The Trussell Trust seems to be doing an amazing job helping communities to set up local food banks; the shame is that they are necessary in this day and age, as so many of us have already said.So, I bought lots of bits and pieces. The volunteers were handing out lists, asking people to consider donating items from the list.  I had also had a look on their local website where they tell people what they are particularly short of in this area, so I varied it a little, and used some of Jack's suggestions, too.I bought Asda own-brand STs (£1.80) because if you have no money for food, you may be in need of those too!  A packet of biscuits [40p], a three for £1 offer on some sweets, two sachets of make-it-with-hot-water custard [30p], chicken noodles [11p], pasta [32p], a tin of meatballs [40p], coffee [47p], UHT milk [53p], tinned tomatoes [31p], jam [29p], squash [42p], peanut butter [62p], fish paste [48p], sugar [88p], jar of pasta sauce [39p], tin rice pud [50p] and tea bags [27p].I was very pleased at how much I managed to get for just under a tenner - this lot came to £9.49, which I was happy to spend as I have never donated to a food bank like this before and wanted to do what I could.  The website list had also asked for nappies, but I had a look and there are so many sizes and kinds that I left well alone, not having a clue which would be the most useful size to buy.I did have a twinge of guilt when I was looking at the pasta in particular and I was putting two packs of conchiglie pasta in my part of the trolley and yet picking up smart price penne for the donation basket.  I still have that twinge - if smart price is good enough for the people who are going to receive the donation, why isn't it good enough for us?  Well, the honest answer is that it is, in many cases; we do buy a lot of items from the value ranges in all the supermarkets, and I have no qualms about shopping at Lidl either.  Today, I bought most items in the value range because I wanted to get as much as I could for the amount I could afford to spend, and that is the bottom line.  If my children were hungry and I was desperate for food for them, I would be glad of anything as long as there was enough to fill their bellies and let them sleep soundly.I hope that the food banks have had their shelves re-stocked in abundance today."},

She has been posting some great recipes lately, too, and we are going to be trying some of the latest out this week, when I sort out the meal plan.I've been mooching around on the MSE website, and found a wealth of ideas for using tinned potatoes - they range in price, apparently, from 14p a tin to 25p a tin, but they are a great storecupboard standby, and with the price of potatoes bound to rise after a dodgy harvest, probably a wise investment as well.  I will be looking for the best prices in Morrison's and Asda tomorrow when we go shopping and I think I will be investing in a tin or three.  I'm planning to build up my storecupboard in preparation for winter, and to that end, I placed an order with Approved Food yesterday.Off to bed in a minute - just fell asleep watching a programme about the demise of bees, presented by Bill Turnbull - which I am very miffed about as I really wanted to see it.  I'll have to look for it on the i-player!  This could have really serious implications, so I wanted to learn more about it and find out more about what we could do to help bees, beyond the massive lavender hedge we have planted, which the bees absolutely love.See you tomorrow - hope you have a great weekend xx"},

I'll be honest about things, though, in that I was given about 20 books relevant to my F&W studies at the weekend, and I bought the YFG a small new storage unit for her room, in the hope of some of her stuff being placed on it rather than the floor.  I need to find space for those books....So the challenge for the month of August is to continue in this vein.  I want to aim to move on 100 items each week.  I may be struggling by the end of the month to find 100 items to move on, but this first week or two will be a doddle.  It will be a case of deciding what to do with the items - some may be worth eBaying, or car booting, and others may just get booted straight into the bin, with the rest going to an assortment of charity shops we have in the area."},

Whilst I was waiting for him to come, I pottered about and hung out a load of washing, bunged another load in, got the chooks food and water all ready to go, and then did a little more weeding of the gravel driveway.  I watered my plants in the greenhouse as well - I felt like I had done a day's work by 8am this morning.I have potted up my pepper plants as some of them were still in tiny plant pots and they badly needed moving up to larger ones.  We have a good array of peppers coming through now, and I know that there will be chillies later in the season.The girls wanted to think about the holiday and what we are going to do together, so we decided on a cinema visit, probably later this week - going to the Tesco site to exchange some vouchers for cinema tickets, I was pleased to find that all Cineworld tickets are currently just £2.50 in vouchers, whether for adults or children, so I changed enough for two visits, and the vouchers are now printed at home, so we don't even have to wait for the postman to bring them - they are here already.Talking about printing, we have also found, printed and filled in the form for the next academic year's 16-19 Bursary for the EFG, ready for enrolment day in September.  She had it this past academic year as well, and it has been helpful to her. She will save this year's bursary up and have a little nest egg for when she is off to university next year and needs a new laptop, perhaps.A trip to Oxburgh Hall or Wimpole Hall is probably also on the cards, which will be \"free\" with my National Trust membership, and both girls are going shopping independently with their groups of friends - one lot on the train to Peterborough and the others on the bus to Cambridge. Neither of them has much money, so they will be doing some window-shopping, although the YFG is going the day after her birthday so she may have a little spare cash, and the EFG earned some money babysitting at the weekend, so she also has a little spare.The weather here today is very showery so I was lucky that I did just manage to get the washing dry before the first major shower.  The FH is feeling sorry for himself with a jippy tummy, probably from eating quite a few fresh cherries yesterday, and a sore ankle, still. He has been pottering around this morning but he is watching a film now about Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday - an old black and white, I think."},
{"title": "My kedgeree adaptation", "date": "Monday 29 July 2013", "text": "Having the internet back, I browsed through some websites and found a recipe for kedgeree.  It wasn't what I was expecting, adding cream and butter to rice and fish to make a very rich dish.  Not quite what I wanted for the family, with the FH's needs and the EFG's weightloss goals to consider.So I adapted it a little!  My ingredients:Young's frozen smoked kippers [herring] which yield 2 kippers for £1.00An onion, finely choppedVegetable stock, made from a stock cube with boiling waterA home-grown green pepper from the greenhouse1 tsp Tesco Value mild curry powderThree hard boiled eggs.I gently fried the onion and the pepper in 2 teaspoons of oil, then added the rice and the curry powder and mixed it all together thoroughly, before adding the stock, and letting it all cook through.  In a separate pan, I hard boiled the eggs while cooking the kippers - they are a boil-in-the-bag arrangement when bought like this, and I thought sharing the pan worked well.The eggs were quickly cooled and peeled, and the fish was extracted from the bag, roughly pulled apart and added to the rice mixture.This was all served on a bed of home-grown lettuce, with the halved eggs on the side.  At a rough guess, I'd say that I fed the three of them for less than £2, I think.  They all enjoyed it; I explained to the girls the need to move away from too many meaty meals, as the YFG was asking why I have been trying out new recipes lately, and she noted that she is not that fond of chicken so she is glad not to have it as often. She's getting it tomorrow....Having spent another half an hour on the phone to another earnest Indian chap who was being very solicitous, I had my doubts about getting back in touch with the world properly this week.  I was being passed from one department from another, and then I got an incoming call on the mobile whilst I was in yet another queue.  Not answering it, I waited and waited in the queue and then lost the signal so I checked the message that the caller had left and do you know what?!? It was an engineer in the next village, telling me that I was his next call and he would be here shortly!He has been, replaced the socket, done what he needed to do - lovely chap from south Lincolnshire - and we are all connected up again.  I just have to go and buy a new phone this afternoon now.  So pleased to be back in touch properly - I don't appreciate the usefulness of the internet until I don't have it!"},
{"title": "Relaxing on Sunday", "date": "Sunday 28 July 2013", "text": "We have had a lovely day today!  I took a service in the north of the area which went well, although I stood in the pulpit, looked across the congregation and realised I was preaching to three preachers and a probationer minister on the organ, and wondered what I was doing up there! They were all very kind afterwards, so I hope it was OK.  My tutor is retiring from ministry this summer, and he very kindly popped in to the church after the service to bring me some Bible commentaries which he is passing on, and I took the opportunity to say my farewells to him.  Rather sad and he will be much missed as he has been a huge support to me.On the way home, I called in to the Morrison's in Wisbech where I very rarely go, but I do like Morrison's. It might actually be my favourite of those pesky supermarkets!  I snaffled some lovely wholemeal rolls and wholemeal loaves on the reduced to clear stand, as well as some onions, which were what I went in for.  I wound my way home across the fens and called in at two roadside stalls, where I bought some fruit and veg - oranges, cherries, grapefruit, a cauliflower for just 79p, some beautiful tomatoes and then at the second stall, a fresh bunch of new carrots. Tonight's menu got altered slightly so that the gang had their sausages in the wholemeal rolls, with fried onions, and the tomatoes on the side with some lettuce from the garden.  They thought that they were delicious, and I was pleased as the YFG is usually reluctant to eat wholemeal bread but she said that the rolls were lovely.The girls went for rather a mini-marathon of a bike ride this afternoon - I reckon they rode for about 8 miles, and were gone nearly 90 minutes.  There was a message on my phone talking about getting a little lost, but they made it home safely for their tea.  The EFG said she enjoyed the ride, but t'other one was heard to be declaring, \"Never again!\"  We'll see...The FH and I sat in the garden this afternoon and chatted for some time - the breeze was quite refreshing and it was such a relief from the heat we have had lately.  There was a shower of rain but nothing much here today. This evening we have enjoyed watching Countryfile and then The White Queen.  I am so glad that the monarchy is more civilised these days!  It is quite interesting to hear \"Elizabeth\" speak as she is doing a very good English accent and there are only a few expressions and words when one can hear that she is not in fact English.  I have the books out, but whilst the EFG has been slightly tempted, I know that they are not really her cup of tea, and the thought of reading all four of the books has been too much for her - I have read them all, and the girls know that, so they keep asking me what happens, and sometimes I have to admit that I have forgotten some of the more intricate details of it all.  It is very interesting to me though, and I do want to get it all clear in my head again, so I may have to re-read them all.Let's see what tomorrow will bring - a phone call to BT is on the cards for sure...The dongle was having a hissy fit and wouldn't connect last night, so all I could do was try to get on the internet through my phone, and as you will see from the last post, that wasn't all that successful!  The \"keyboard\" wouldn't appear when I wanted to type the main post...Anyway, apart from that, yesterday was a largely good day in many ways.  With not having gym this week, I was able to work on today's service earlier and got it finished by 2pm yesterday, about 10 hours ahead of the usual schedule, which was brilliant, and meant that I was relaxed enough to have a nap yesterday afternoon after we had been watching some athletics.  The girls amused themselves all day with one thing and another, including going for a bike ride, and making themselves an approximation of a Monopoly board as they couldn't find ours.  I left them watching a film last night when I went to bed to read.Last night's dinner was interesting - it was the creamy salmon pasta which I was inspired to try from Sue's post, and the recipe itself came from Jack's blog.  The family's take on it was that I didn't put enough chilli flakes in it and that the fish paste made the taste a little chalky but that the lemon flavours came through well and that the girls would eat it again.  The FH's tastebuds appear to be on holiday and he found it very bland and wouldn't want it again, so that's a 66% success rate, I suppose.There was a lot of rain here last night, but no thunder or lightning that I am aware of, and it does look as if it is blowing up to rain again this morning, although the forecast is only for heavy showers to move through the area, not for any prolonged rain. I will hope to get back here later on to read your blogs and catch up on your news xx"},

{"title": "Menu to month end", "date": "Thursday 25 July 2013", "text": "A rummage around and some ideas from the internet have brought me some inspiration for a bit of a use-it-up menu for the rest of the month with minimal spending.Today we have had leftover chicken from yesterday's roast, with a vegetable risotto where I was able to hide some past-their-best veg from the fridge as well as leftover greens from yesterday!  Nothing wasted if I can help it.Friday - I am going to stick a can of corned beef in the fridge to chill for a few hours, and then serve it with hot new potatoes and veg - we have beans in the garden as well as peas from the garden and courgettes.Saturday - inspired by this post at Sue's blog, we are going to try this Creamy Salmon pasta recipe.  I just bought a small pot of natural yogurt and some fish paste as per the instructions.Sunday - we have some sausages lurking in the freezer, so they are coming out to be enjoyed with more new potatoes and some salad - lettuce and cucumber from the garden and tomatoes from Lidl.Monday - I know we have some smoked fish in the freezer so I will be looking for some recipes for Kedgeree on the internet and putting together something that resembles one of them with what I have available!Tuesday - my favourite - sticky chicken with new potatoes and veg.Wednesday - we are going to try FQ's recipe for Sweet and Sour veggies but with plain rice. I know I mention new potatoes quite a lot, and they are expensive to buy but I have been really lucky and have received quite a lot of them recently free from UJ and from the Head Coach at gym.  We also have some grown in our own garden so we have plenty!  We also eat them cold with a dab of salad cream and a sprinkle of chives as a potato salad at lunchtime - they are gorgeous and I do know how lucky we are.We are eating a little more meat this week, as there were murmurs next week so I think that I cut back too quickly - I shall have to be more gradual as the meat-free meals become more normal.  I am looking forward to trying more and more vegetarian meals, but I think I would have a rebellion on my hands if it went too quickly.  We are finding a better variation of meals which are enjoyed by the family and I am trying to increase my repertoire somewhat - albeit quite slowly!At this time of year, we are also pleased to be almost self-sufficient in salad and veg, although I have bought carrots today, as well as apples, tomatoes, bananas, cherries and grapes.  I haven't had to buy lettuce, peppers, cucumbers, new potatoes, green beans, courgettes, or salad onions though. Just for the record, here is some of our damage from the lightning in the early hours of Tuesday morning.This is one of the Nintendo DS chargers that was in a plug behind the sofa.  It was just in the socket, not turned on.  Both sides of the charger have been blown out, and they were some distance from the socket on the floor.This is the BT main socket where the line comes in to the house.  Scorch marks and the plastic blown apart again.And this is the fireplace.  You can see a smashed tile in there, and the woodwork damaged here.  Must have been some force!The Claims company and the loss adjuster have both been on the phone tonight and the chap is coming tomorrow as he has had a cancellation so he can fit us in earlier; he'll be here about 11.30am and BT anytime between 8am and 1pm.  Hopefully we will be on the up tomorrow!"},

{"title": "Challenge number 2 for the week", "date": "Tuesday 23 July 2013", "text": "Just when we were recovering from thehospital episode, another drama hit us early this morning, quite literally.Thunderstorms had been forecast for thearea, and they arrived in the night, passing over quite close to us, and wakingus all up in the early hours of the morning. We were all sitting on our bed at about 4.30am when there was ahorrendously loud bang, and we all jumped!A power cut accompanied the sound, andthe girls and I came downstairs to check that all was well, and to silence thealarm, which had gone off in symphony with several of the neighbours’.  Looking around the sitting room with torches,we could see smoke in the beams of light, and we could smell a scorched aroma,and all of us thought it was the tv.  Wewent back upstairs and told the FH that we thought a new tv was probably on thecards.Getting up this morning, I noticed thatthe FH’s copper kettle was on its side by the fireplace, and that several ofthe tiles in the fireplace had broken as well as one having come off the wall.I then wondered if the lightning had struck the metal chimney outside….Having sorted out the electricitysupply and got that going again by getting the trip switches all back in theright positions, I tried to make the telephone work, and that was when wediscovered what we now believe to be the reason for the enormous bang in thenight!The main socket where the phone lineenters the house had been blown apart, and the phone power supply had also beenblown off from the main part of its plug. As well as the damage to the tiles, the wooden fireplace surround hasalso been damaged and there was some wood from the wood boxes for the firewhich had rearranged itself.It all seems consistent with a bigelectric shock [lightning?] coming in via the phone socket and travellingacross the room from the socket across the fireplace.  The shock also seems to have damaged my BTrouter so I am now on a 3 dongle as a temporary measure, and our upstairstv/dvd combo machine is as dead as a dodo.I have had a couple of hours {I kid younot} being passed from one BT department to another and we have an engineercoming Friday morning to look at the socket, and a new Home Hub on its way aswell, for free, having re-contracted for another year at a slightly betterrate.  I have also been on to theinsurers about the other damage and a claims company will be in touch tomorrow –replacing the tiles around the fire will be a big job because the stove willhave to come out, and it is more than the FH can do with all his problems atthe moment, so this could be where having insurance is worthwhile.There is a glimmer of good news today,though, in that the EFG had her interview at the passport office and it seemsto have gone well, so we are hopeful that her passport will indeed be herewithin the promised ten working days. Fingers crossed!"},

{"title": "Thank you, my friend", "date": "Sunday 21 July 2013", "text": "Wannabe Sybil left me a comment yesterday about the FH and her own Dear Uncle's condition.  I am so glad she did. Last night, the FH started to look decidedly dodgy, and rather like an infection might have set in, but I wouldn't have thought of that without WS's comment yesterday since we were convinced it was just the gout.When I was trying to get him settled for bed last night, he had beads of sweat on his forehead, he still hadn't eaten much at all, and worst of all, he was confused and not answering my questions properly.  I phoned the doctor's number, spoke with the local locum service, and was advised to get an ambulance.Two lovely chaps turned up just before 1am, and did a really thorough check, and found several symptoms indicative of infection, so they carted him off.  The YFG was awake, so she came with me in the car behind the ambulance - they started off in front of us, but we caught them up on the way. In the ED, the admitting nurse also thought there were signs of infection, and took blood tests and did all the usual admitting checks, and inserted a canula in his hand.  At that point, sometime just before 4am, I had to bring the YFG home and get some sleep.We rang up this morning to be told that he could come home.  The blood tests didn't show any signs of infection but he had an IV of antibiotic anyway, and he is feeling much better in that respect.  His foot is still painful, but he is walking on it more easily.Having been awake yesterday and this morning for 22 hours straight, it is no wonder that I had a nap this evening, and the YFG and the FH pottered about and prepared the supper.  Fingers crossed that things continue to improve.  And thank you, Sybil, you are a great friend xxx"},
{"title": "Kitchen time tonight", "date": "Saturday 20 July 2013", "text": "Having found Jack's recipe for Pasta All Genovese tonight, and being in need of inspiration for supper today, it was a happy coincidence that I could pull together most of the ingredients for it!I used home grown freshly picked green beans [free], home grown cooked-yesterday new potatoes [free], value spaghetti, a clove of garlic, a couple of ounces of very strong cheddar cheese and 2 teaspoons of mint sauce.  I didn't have the basil and fresh mint that Jack's recipe calls for, so I improvised a little, and mixed the mint sauce with the crushed garlic, and loosened it off with some of the water from the pasta before stirring it through the cooked spaghetti/beans/potatoes and topping each bowl with a sprinkle of cheese.  Minimal cost, maximum taste and the fussiest of the three I fed it to declared it \"rather good\" [YFG].  Thanks, Jack!The FH's gout is still very sore and he is resting in bed.  I am keeping him dosed up on the codeine and the paracetamol, with topical applications of soothing menthol cream to the affected area.  I am also making him walk, with his crutches, through to the back bedroom and back at least every 90 minutes so that it doesn't stiffen up too much. He has totally lost his appetite though, which yesterday I put down to the heat.  Today it has been much fresher here, but he has probably eaten even less.  We are making sure to keep him hydrated though.Feeling very fed up of bought carrots going rotten too quickly, I have a new idea, which I have used these past three weeks and thought it was time I shared!  On purchase, I peel and chop the bag of carrots, usually about a kilogram, and store them in water in a lidded plastic container in the fridge.  They keep beautifully and the up side of this is that they are ready to cook each day as soon as I want them."},

We don't seem to be eating as much in this heat, and I am eating FreeFrom pitta breads with tuna or tongue, and then filling up with lettuce, beetroot and tomatoes - one of those fills me up quite well!  I did have a chicken salad one evening when I used up a lonely half a chicken breast from the freezer. We went to Sainsbury's this evening whilst the YFG was in the piano lesson, but we bought more drink than food - the FH is unable to take much liquid in a day because of all the diuretics he is taking, so he is restricted to about 1.5 litres in a day - for any and all liquid intake.  He hates plain water, so we bought him some lemonade, ginger beer and lime cordial to keep him going in this heat.  All as cheaply as we could, looking for the bargains!"},

{"title": "Five family meals from the stores and garden", "date": "Monday 15 July 2013", "text": "Just had a rummage in the storecupboard, and a wander round the garden, and a quick flick round the interwebs, and come up with five meals for the week ahead.Monday - tonight we are heading over here to try out our version of this frittata.  We have cold potatoes left over from yesterday, courgette and peppers available, as well as eggs and onions, so I think we can get this one on the plate although perhaps without the ham - I can use a slice or two of bacon.Tuesday - a quick meal when I get back from gym - cooked pasta and veg with a tin of tuna, bound together with a tin of celery soup from the cupboard.  A make-it-up-as-you-go tuna pasta dish.Wedensday - temperatures will still be high, so some salad is on the menu.  Lettuce and cucumber from the garden, tomatoes from Lidl are in the fridge, hard boiled eggs, pickles, some boiled potatoes or savoury rice [AF] and we'll be all set.Thursday - a busy day as I am interviewing and then the YFG has her piano lesson, so a very simple meal of vegetable soup and bread if they want it, and then a mandarin cheesecake to follow [tin and packet from AF].  Friday - the family can have a third of a Fray Bentos pie each, served with lots of vegetables [from the garden or the freezer] and some new potatoes from the garden.There isn't a meal amongst that lot that I can actually eat as it is written, with my wheat and dairy limitations, but I will eat something along the same lines most nights - variations on a theme.  I have FreeFrom pitta breads and I eat rice when they have pasta.  I'll let you know how it goes!My Monday monitoring has been done this morning, and there are swings and roundabouts to the findings, as usual.(image from bbc.co.uk)Our electricity consumption for the week has dropped to 105 units for the week, where we had been in the 110-119 range the past few weeks, so we are doing something right.  However, the tariff has changed, and we are now paying slightly more for the electricity than we were.  This week's charges will amount to £15.12 for my 105 units....the last time I paid an amount close to that, £15.19, on the old tariff, it bought me 139 units of electricity.  Having popped back to Martin's Cheap Energy Club on MSE, I can see that there are cheaper tariffs available, but none of them are fixed until Feb 2016 the way this one is.  Comparable long term fixes are more expensive with other companies.  Just like other people, we will have to look for more ways to cut our consumption if we want to keep our bill stable.Financially, June was a hard month with lots of expenses all coming at once, and the savings account suffered badly with no savings made at all.  That situation is very rare here, and I am determined to make up the difference over the course of the year.  Calculations this morning show that if I want to hit my target for the year, the average monthly saving for the next six months has to be higher - quite a bit higher - at nearly £900 a month - £890 if we want to be precise.  Because we saved nothing at all in June, the average for the first six months was only £611 a month.Strategies to help us to achieve this are going to be focussed around the house and the food budget - I will be taking more recipes from \"A girl called Jack\" and we will be eating more from the garden over the summer too, which should help somewhat.  Remembering that we have peppers, cucumber, courgette, beans, lettuce, strawberries, raspberries, beetroot and spring onion all in production, we should be able to think of several meals we can make with those, especially with the eggs that the girls are producing!  I am also going to make sure that the ground where crops finish producing is used again this growing season if at all possible, so I am going to be looking through the seed packets this morning for some inspiration there.We also have a stocked cupboard and freezers, so we need to be eating more from those before we buy more food.  Sounds like I need to sort out a menu plan for this week today as well.See you later!"},

{"title": "Bone dry", "date": "Wednesday 10 July 2013", "text": "This weather is wreaking havoc on my garden, and I read Frantic's recent post about mulching with interest. I do water my veggies, but not all of them all of the time.  I prioritise the ones in troughs and in pots, and then the beans.  Beans seem to be very thirsty, so they get a watering can full each day on each section of beans.  Unfortunately, I have emptied the water butt, and I am having to use mains water now.  I am not very happy about that but I am resisting the temptation to moan at the FH about it - he is \"waiting\" for a friend of a friend to source him some barrels of some kind......we've been waiting over a year, and well, they aren't here.  I am sure that if this dry spell goes on, and there will be others, the money I will spend on mains water would easily have bought a couple of new water butts.  I should have just bought them myself and got on with it!  The potatoes are pathetic and the beetroot are very small.We had the first picking off the dwarf beans today and I shall cook them tomorrow.  Picking little and often seems to be the way to go with them.  We love beans and I have plenty of them growing this year.  There are courgettes forming on the plants now, and the raspberries are fruiting too.  The gooseberry plants have failed to produce anything beyond a few leaves, though, which is a shame.  UJ's garden is producing very well - we have been brought more strawberries today, as well as peas in the pod.  The FH and UJ sat in the sitting room this afternoon, one shelling peas and the other taking the green bits out of the top of the berries.  That was after they had had a snooze to help to digest their lunch from going to the Lunch Club!We have had a very long Governors' meeting tonight - nearly three hours, as there was so much to get through with it being the end of the year, and the last meeting.  It has been another challenging year, but we continue to move forward slowly.  We had a presentation tonight about the pros and cons of becoming an academy - hardly an easy topic and one with lots of pitfalls, it seems.  Decisions, decisions!I am tentatively asking the girls what they would like for their birthdays, as they are both coming up in August - the YFG first, turning 14, and then the EFG making it to driving-lesson age at 17.  Oh, boy!  17 - how did that happen so quickly?  One thing is for certain - she won't be getting a car!"},
{"title": "Do you coupon?", "date": "Tuesday 9 July 2013", "text": "I don't really think that I do, in the mad keen sense of the word.  The use of coupons is going a little crazy in some quarters, and I signed up to \"like\" someone's page on Facebook in the mistaken thought that I might learn something.  I did learn something - that this lady's idea of a day out is to trek around the city on a series of buses with a toddler, picking up bargains at the various shops.  Hello!!!! Let's get real...Some of us have better things to do with our time, and I am not going to get excited about a coupon for cheap kitchen roll - the frugal thing to do is to use kitchen cloths and old rags for mucky jobs and then throw them in the washing machine, or in the bin if they are too bad.  That's just one example!Many coupons seem to be for branded items, where the shop-brand is usually cheaper that the branded item is even using a coupon.  I am really not convinced.  Don't get me entirely wrong - if I see a coupon for something that we use, then I will make the most of the opportunity, but I don't think that there are serious savings to be made for the frugal family by using coupons.  When I review items for BzzAgent, I am given a coupon in order to get the item free, but then I also receive more coupons to share with friends or use myself - often for 50p or £1 off the item - but I don't use them if we are already using a cheaper alternative which we like; we just have the free one and leave it at that.I do like the till-spits at Sainsbury's and Tesco where you are rewarded with the difference if your shopping would have been cheaper elsewhere but I have had less of these lately as they compete with each other and the other supermarkets to keep prices competitive.  The pantry principle, stockpiling and watching prices will remain my key strategies for keeping our budget under control, as well as controlling portion sizes and comparing price-per-portion so that we remember that a vegetarian bean meal is going to be cheaper per portion than a steak dinner!"},

Then there is the washing powder mountain I accumulated in June too.  With Persil on half price at £6 for 50 washes, I'd have been daft not to since I had the money available.  I know it meant spending £36, but it is good quality washing powder which works very well, and the advertised 50 washes comes in at just 12p a wash, but I know that I get far more washes out of a box than that.  I reckon I have got more than enough to see me through Christmas, if not into 2014....(image from britstore.co.uk)Keeping track also reveals my weaknesses, which I do try to combat, but obviously not terribly well.  Magazines.  \"Free from\" cakes.  Books.

Have a lovely day xx"},
{"title": "Charity Shopping spree", "date": "Saturday 29 June 2013", "text": "After a busy morning at the gym, we went into town to find the YFG some wellies for the trenches in Belgium this week.  A shop is closing down, and when we went in, there were only four pairs of wellies on a high shelf, so I asked the assistant if any of them were the appropriate size, hoping that the £28 pair weren't going to be the ones, but you can just guess that they were!  Luckily, as it is closing, the shop is offering 70% off the marked prices, so we paid just over £9 for them - quite a bargain as they are very good wellies!We came home after that and had some lunch.  We readied ourselves and the FH put on his \"going out\" clothes, so we all went off to Ely, where I think the charity shops have a slightly better selection of donations than our local ones.  (image from en.wikipedia.org)We struck gold in the very first one, for the BHF, where the YFG found a strapless black evening dress which is quite decent [however I have described it - sorry!] and which will be perfect for the black tie evenings on the cruise.  The EFG also found a top in there.(image from mirror.co.uk)Oxfam sadly didn't furnish us with any further bargains, but another charity shop further along the street was well worth a good rummage, and we found a couple more items in there - a cardigan for the YFG and another top for the EFG, I think.After that, we had a look in a shop called \"Select\" which yielded three dresses - two similar ones in different colours for the YFG and one for the EFG in a floral fabric, which she and I both loved.  We need to find some accessories for it, but it is really nice - and they were all in the sale!If we can go back and look over the various charity shops and the \"cheaper\" shops in the area over the next two months, I think we will be able to supplement their existing wardrobes with enough items that they will be respectable on the holiday.  We also want to take advantage of the Tesco Double Up voucher offer, but we have only days left to do that!A friend did suggest that I should crochet them some clothes but somehow I don't think I am up to that just yet!  I have enjoyed doing more squares on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning at chapel, and the ladies there have been very encouraging!"},
{"title": "Spending like crazy!", "date": "Friday 28 June 2013", "text": "It feels like the money is flowing from the household uncontrollably this month, which is quite scary.  Lots of things have conspired to come together to make June a spend, spend, spend month, and I can't say that I like it much!I have yet to finalise the month's spending and saving totals completely, but I will do that at the weekend.  Looking ahead to July, I can see that the spending will continue a little.So what are we spending on?  Apart from stocking up the cupboards, which I will post on at the end of the month when I have rounded up all the figures, it is things like travel and trips in particular.The YFG has had two school trips which I have paid for this month - one to Kew Gardens this week [£16] and one as a reward for her hard work and achievements this year, which is a bowling/cinema trip with the school [£17.50], and then there is her trip to France this week coming - I have paid for the trip itself but now she needs wellies for walking about the battlefields and trenches apparently, as well as euros [blagged from Grandad!] and some cash for a meal on the way home. York Minster(image from en.wikipedia.org)Within June, I took the EFG to Lincoln [£30+ trainfare] and then to Norwich to UEA [diesel costs] but on 3rd July we need to go to York for the day.  Given that we have not booked the train tickets months in advance, and we have no railcards that we can use on the day [because the YFG isn't coming] it is going to cost me £192 for two of us to go for a day return.  £192!  You read that right.  Yes, I could drive, but it would be about 3.5 hours there, and the same back, as well as a full day on my feet walking about the university, and we need to be there by 9.30am.....and I can't do that to myself - I would be exhausted for days afterwards.  Staying the night beforehand would be tricky and inconvenient, and we certainly can't stay the night afterwards to spread the driving because the next morning, Thursday, is when the YFG is off to France and I need to be here to wave her off!  We will be catching a train at about 6am though, so it will still be a very long and tiring day, but I can hope for a snooze on the train between Peterborough and York.I have thought about getting the EFG a Young Person's Railcard, but at £30, funnily enough, it will save just £31 off the cost of this journey.  We are not great train-travellers, so it doesn't seem worth it at the moment. Once she is at university in the Autumn of 2014, depending on where she goes, it will be a worthwhile investment, I do agree. I am just hoping we are able to go to Aberystwyth on a Saturday Open day so that we can drive over there on the Friday afternoon and then have the Sunday to recover!This trip will see the third university, and with the Welsh trip coming up in the autumn, and UEA now off the list for sure, we may have two more trips to make - on the other hand, she may have to do as I did and apply to some that she hasn't visited!  I only visited two of the five that I applied to back in the day, and I was very lucky to get a place at one of those I had seen and loved.St Mary's College, St Andrews where I studied(image from st-andrews.ac.uk)I am spending the money for my own sake, and because the EFG thinks that York might be a serious contender in her list of places to apply for Biochemistry.  I am counting my blessings indeed that I have the funds available, and that the only thing going short will be the savings account again.  This is the kind of spending that I save towards, if you see what I mean - I know that my saving has a purpose in that I will be able to do those things which the family needs to do, without bunging it on a credit card and skimping for months to pay it back. Don't get me started on the clothes/shoes we are worrying about for the cruise - we are going to be scouring the charity shops for some evening clothes on a fairly regular basis between now and the end of August!"},

I have made my first payment today to Compassion UK for my sponsored child, which has prompted me to think about writing to her, so I am making some notes as I think of what I would like to include in my letter."},

A school meeting at 1pm, home again and then off to town to the Post office to get the passport applications sent off.......that took a while!  Thence to gymnastics and eventually home again at 8.30pm to a home cooked meal of roast turkey leg, roast potatoes and green veg, courtesy of the FH and the EFG.  They had also been and picked up the YFG on her return from London.   Money has been jiggled about to pay for the passports for now, so it won't look quite right until Dad refunds me, but I know what I have done, so it is all OK there.  I received some seeds in the post today which I ordered at the tail end of last week through an offer I found - they arrived safely and in good packaging.  The seeds are not out of date, and there are a good number of seeds in the packet, so I don't hesitate to let you have the link and there are still seeds for sale at good prices.  I ordered some of the most popular things which we grow, and so we are nearly set for next year's summer salads and vegetables, for about £5!  Definitely worth a look if you grow anything - they also have flower seeds on there in a different section, but I didn't buy any of those this time."},

What is wrong with a plain but heartfelt, \"Thank you\"?  When did this \"so much\" get added in? And then there is the \"little man\" thing.  I know three families now with small male children, and they all speak of the child as a \"little man\" - why?  We don't call girls, \"little women\" - the closest I have ever heard to that is my aunt who used to affectionately call us girls, \"my woman\" when she was addressing us - as children of 8+, I seem to remember.  A small male child is a boy - so why not use that, or the child's name?  Now that would be novel!Today, you will have guessed, I am feeling a little out-of-sorts: I have a headache and a very sore throat and I have just endured three hours of gymnastics, feeling not quite all there, and with the Head Coach in a minor grouch because two coaches will not be there on Saturday, and although I told him weeks ago that I was taking the EFG to UEA, the other coach just told him tonight that she is going to a party........cue a slightly grumpy man. Tomorrow I was going to go to Cambridge to a UCAS fair that the EFG is going to, so that I could scout round more stands asking questions of other universities, so that we could eliminate some without travelling too far!  I don't feel up to the trek now, so I will just have to hope that the EFG can disengage from her friends or drag them with her as she seems to be the only one of them serious about going to uni, so they aren't going to be that focussed.  She's got a list of stands she needs to look at, and I will wish her well in the morning.I shall try to be more positive in the morning........and if any of you have boys, and call them \"little men\", just carry on and ignore me ;)"},

I use less than the recommended dose, I know, but the washing still comes out clean, even on a quick wash.  The 25 wash pack is still available and being sold in the shop for £7 - and I saw people actually buying it....All in all, I plugged the holes in our store cupboards, including buying a sack of rabbit food, and feel more secure in the knowledge that the cupboards won't be bare this month.Overall, I know that I have spent most of the month's budget already, but I feel that we have most of what we need to make it through the rest of the month without spending too much more.  Having paid the car repair bill, the gas bottle bill, and another school trip for the YFG, I know the bills are paid, and what we have is our own, for now!  Over the rest of the month, I know I will need to fill up my car with diesel for the trip to UEA next Saturday, and we'll probably need more fruit before the end of the month, as well as carrots, mushrooms, etc, but we are pretty well stocked up."},

{"title": "New favourite inspiration websites", "date": "Thursday 13 June 2013", "text": "I'm sure that all you crochet fans out there are well aware of the amazing talent that is Lucy at Attic24, but I just discovered her in my recent desire to learn to crochet.  She has some really clear tutorials and sets everything out so that it is easily understood, and there are several things that I want to try soon!  I love the summer Granny squares, the cowl for winter snuggling and the jolly bunting triangles.  I am also loving all the pictures I am coming across on Pinterest, which are a massive inspiration.There is also the lovely Heather over at LittleTinBird who also has some great tutorials.  She posts a list of finished items in her right hand sidebar which might make one drool!I am off to the Knit and Natter in the morning so I shall expand my square by another few rounds, and then I  might finish it and try some little squares.  The whole thing of choosing colours to combine is quite exciting.Apart from all that, the FH has had a restful day, spending the morning in bed mostly asleep and then having his cousin visiting this afternoon.  He hasn't got any major commitments in the next few days, so he can continue to get his breath back, so to speak.  I, on the other hand, have to go back to gymnastics tomorrow and Saturday, which is going to come hard after having Saturday off for Lincoln and Tuesday off for recuperating.I was very glad that the forecast gusty winds didn't actually materialise here in the strength that was predicted, but there was enough to give my poor broad bean plants quite a bashing today.  The humidity levels have been a little oppressive here today, and we have felt the need to have the windows open, which has been tricky with the breeze.Cost cutting wise, I have just been very brave and let the girls trim the length of my hair....it looks fine in a ponytail, it will soon grow again, and I just saved myself £7 or £8!  I have got to get my head around my tax return and my tax credits form this month, as well as finding time to get some more Faith & Worship work done - I need to get two exegeses done before my tutor retires at the end of July and I get passed over to a new one.  I shall be very very sad to see him go, although I wish him very well in his retirement.  He is a very holy man, one whom you just know is deeply in touch with God, and just by being in his company for a little while, one feels that bit closer to God oneself somehow.  I shall miss him.It's ebbing and flowing here this month - comes in in one hand, and there is a bill in the other hand waiting for it! I have just bought two new gas canisters [47kg ones] for the gas hob, at a cost of £124, delivered from an outlet some miles away for only three pounds so a total of £127.  And that includes deposits of £10 on each bottle because they don't take away other people's bottles so I have now got four standing there!  Quick calculation means that the gas itself has cost me £104, or £52 a bottle.  Rather an improvement on the local supplier, [a Skoda garage on a certain roundabout for those in the know] who wanted £75 a bottle, and £5 to deliver!  And there was no deposit in that either because I have two of his bottles.....Pays to shop around.  Hopefully those two bottles will see us through to this time next year.And then there is the Fiesta's get-me-through-the-MOT bill - £142.42. And I have a toothache.Let's look on the bright side.  The FH has exhausted himself this week and is having the morning asleep in bed, so I can watch a DVD whilst I do the heap of ironing still awaiting me; I have a hooky afternoon planned at the chapel with some other ladies for the Thursday afternoon club, and I may even make cake to take along.  Then the YFG has a piano lesson, and we have to go to school tonight for a meeting about her upcoming overnight Battlefields trip.  She gets to request her room-mate tonight, so I have told her to make final plans for that today!  Dinner has come out of the freezer and is thawing.Green veg?  Inspire me, please.  The Warfarin-induced lack of green leafy/cruciferous veg is getting a tad tedious for the FH.  He has now decided that he doesn't like green beans, and that leaves me with asparagus, which he doesn't like after it has been frozen, so only fresh - limited season there, and it is coming to a close.  I have got some broad beans, which are fine, but would get boring day after day.  I have salads in the garden nearly ready for eating, and I think that he might have to embrace beans sometime soon - not the baked variety...Any inspiration welcome!"},

{"title": "Taking some time", "date": "Tuesday 11 June 2013", "text": "Remembering how I felt when I had a general anaesthetic to have my wisdom tooth out years ago, I negotiated some space this week, so that if the FH just wanted to sleep, he could.  I wangled the night off from gymnastics tonight so that I could get some rest after the weekend busy-ness, and I put off an appointment till next month.One day after the op, and he went out this afternoon with a beekeeping mate to supervise the collection of a swarm of bees from a school playing field over the river.  I did tell the chap that the FH was to do nothing but advise.  They have made arrangements to go and have a look around an auction in the morning, and the chap is picking him up at 8.50am.  And now I hear that another beekeeping friend is coming to pick him up tomorrow afternoon to go and have a look at the man's hives.....at least if the FH collapses with this chap, he is the village doctor!The YFG has had a couple of days at home with what has turned out to be a water infection but after a long trip to the doctor's this morning, she will be back to school tomorrow.  She's a lot better, and I have been giving her plenty to drink - she will soon float!And I have been pottering today.  I have written a reference for a church friend who has just been offered a job, made some tickets for a church event and delivered them to the lady who is selling them, I've done washing, organised all the recycling for the collection tomorrow, cooked the tea, had a chat with my sister on the phone, done some ironing, sowed more seeds in the garden and hoed the seedlings just coming through, had a one-sided chat with the blackbird nesting in the garden, and emptied the water-butt by watering all my pots and seeds - we need rain!I've also watched a youtube video on how to join the yarn in crochet, so I'll be trying that tomorrow.  The square has used up a 50g ball of wool, so I want to add in another colour now but I have to undo some of the current round so that I don't have two colours in one round, as there isn't enough of the current colour to finish the round.Off to bed now with the book that I started whilst we were waiting at the surgery this morning - one can read quite a few chapters in an hour with no distractions!"},

Apart from all that, the washing has all dried, the family have enjoyed a meal of roast beef from the freezer and I had some poached salmon, all served with roast potatoes and veggies.  Tonight we have watched the last Case Histories, and I have cast on another hat.  I can't crochet whilst watching tv, so I may as well knit! I think that the EFG was right today when she said that at 40, I don't like to not be able to do something that I want to be able to do, and I just have to get over myself and practise....who made her so wise at 16?They both have exams in the morning so I am hoping that they are asleep..."},

Thank you for the recommendations and the ideas - I will have a look at the blogs you mention - Attic24 is one I already knew about and Lucy's fabulous designs are in part responsible for me not wanting to put learning this skill off any longer.  I will also have a look for the book Ang recommends in the library.  I saw a couple of books in WHSmith yesterday that looked quite delicious but given what I had posted the other day about aspirational clutter, I thought that they were best left in there on the shelf.  I may go back for the titles though, so that I can look in the library for them, as they were rather nice.I shall be able to do something by the end of the month. I Shall.  I am determined!The first of June and time to reveal this month's challenge........I am going to learn to crochet this month, and my aim is to have created something from crochet by the end of the month.  Perhaps nothing as complicated as this, though!(image from commons.wikipedia.org)This has been a vague \"something I want to do in 2013\" kind of aim for a while, so I thought that I needed to make it a more concrete target, and having slipped the latest hat off the knitting needles last night, I think that now is the time to begin!This lady on Youtube seems to know what she is talking about so I'm going to start here...I don't have anyone lined up to actually teach me to crochet, so I am relying on what I can find in books that I might already have in the house, and the internet.

{"title": "End of the month musings", "date": "Friday 31 May 2013", "text": "I can't believe that May has slipped from us this quickly in a sea of rain and drizzle just lately.  We have had the odd brilliant day amongst the wet ones, but the good days seem to have been on the mean side.  We could definitely do with more! Achievements for May include getting the vegetable garden planted and finding the floor in the spare room as well.  These may not sound like big things, but they are major for me!  I have also completed the 10th knitted hat for the Operation Christmas Child project, and this week I have knitted one for my sister following her head shaving episode last week. The \"No-Tesco\" challenge has been done, and on reflection, I don't think I feel that I have failed. Yes, I have been in there twice this month - but twice in a month is nothing compared to the two or three times a week I had been going shopping there.The spending record is slightly down, which is good, overall.  The cupboards have been a little bare at times, though, as I have not been able to find the same level of deals that we usually get in Tesco.  My stocks have depleted somewhat, and I have changed the way I have shopped this month, from what Amy Daczyzyn calls the Pantry Principle to more of a meal plan method.  I consistently think that the PP is a more economical way of eating - you buy what is cheaper or on offer and then make up your plan from what you have in the cupboards.We have paid the bills for the month and hit the savings target quite hard, although, as I said, we didn't achieve it quite....we gave it a jolly good shot though! June's savings target is going to be reduced to £500 for several reasons: - to take into consideration the fact that I know there is going to be a garage bill for the MOT repairs on the Fiesta - I know I need to get the sewage treatment plant pit emptied, and I need to buy a new gas bottle for the cooker - I personally need a little wiggle room this month so that the target is not my raison d'etre for the month and I can live a little without constantly thinking about money.  Just for one month!- the EFG's weight loss has hit a plateau or a brick wall and we need to do something different to kick start that.  This may need some funding in one way or another - attending a club, getting the bike fixed again, organising some kind of activity with her......I don't know yet. - I'm going to achieve the target, and feel good about that......I have also decided to sponsor a child through Compassion.  Various things have been pointing me to that cause, and yesterday I came across their UK website through another blogger, and on there I found a teenager in South America who is the same age as the YFG and has one of her middle names so I feel that there is a connection.  I will be arranging this tomorrow, and feel very settled about the idea.  This post made me think about it in a particular way and spurred me on to make a decision.And June's challenge?  You'll just have to wait till morning for that one!"},
{"title": "Family times", "date": "Thursday 30 May 2013", "text": "We have had a lovely evening with the young friends who have been to tea.They started off playing on the Wii until the supper was ready, and then they all came to the table for sausage, mash and beans, followed by slices of this yummy lemon sponge.And after that, they stayed at the table - they have had games of cards, of chess, of Trivial Pursuits, and much hilarity over a card game called Slam! which I remember being rather addicted to when I was about 12 and at school - we played tournaments every lunchtime.  The visitors have gone home but the girls are still playing...I'm just not a minimalist.  At all.  Can't even contemplate the concept.  I read on Laura's blog here that she has only 57 books.  57?  That can't be enough ;)I must have ten or twenty times that many books......There are four sections like this in the office...[above] This is the bottom of the last two sections closest to the patio doors.And this [above] is the top half of the same two sections.And then there are the other two sections.And the shelves under the stairs.The heap by the bed.The little bookshelf in the sitting room.The big bookshelf in the EFG's room.The unit in the spare bedroom.And it brought to mind an infographic about clutter which Ann V shared one day this week, and I remembered one of the kinds of clutter - \"Aspirational\" clutter and I realised that that is what a lot of these books are. They represent things I would like to cook, things I would like to make, emotions I'd like to feel, places I might like to go, and perhaps even the person I might like to be.And it came to me that there is only one book I will ever really need.(image from clcbookshops.com)It takes me a long time to realise these things, Lord, but I am slowly getting there!UJ is not a man to blow his own trumpet at all, and so when I saw a photo of him on his sideboard this morning, I was intrigued.  It showed him in the centre, flanked by two others, all three of them cutting a cake with a 50th anniversary celebration design on it.......I had to ask what that was all about, didn't I!  Turns out that the local stockmen's club has just celebrated its 50th anniversary, and he was involved in the cutting ceremony because they have just elected him the president of the club.  It is an honorary lifelong title, it seems - the term being for the rest of your life, since most die in office.  I wished him a very very long presidency!We popped in to see him on our way home from the hospital this morning, and I took the chance to have a nosey around his garden again - there is always a lot to look at.Some of the plants actually have a connection with me, so I thought I would share a few of them.These arum lilies [above and below] came from our first garden in Fenland when we moved south from Cupar.  My grandmother and mother were particularly fond of these lilies, and so when we moved from that house, we split up several clumps of them and brought them to UJ's house where they are thriving.This bush [below] came from the garden of the first Scottish house we had - my mum nabbed a cutting when she came to stay and it grew rather well.  Now it is a large bush at the back of UJ's fishpond and it looks gorgeous covered in light pink flowers.This honeysuckle is a long established plant in UJ's garden that I remember from my childhood.  It used to have a climbing rose entwined within it, but I think that the honeysuckle has engulfed the rose and it has been overcome!  The honeysuckle smells so sweet on summer evenings.A closer view of the honeysuckle.And a peony.  This has nothing to do with me, and is a more recent addition to UJ's collection.  It was a tree peony, but when he cut down a nearby eucalyptus tree, the top of it got damaged and now it has all these bushy shoots which come from lower down the stem, and these produce flowers rather than the original tree stem, although that is still growing.I am looking forward to seeing this peony in full bloom in a week or so's time when we go to stay at UJ's house for the FH's trip to Papworth for the cardioversion.  A warm welcome to my new follower - do say Hello one of these days! Today the FH has to go to Papworth for an appointment at the Sleep Centre for his sleep apnoea, so we are heading out at about 8.15am, and taking his old friend along for the ride.  When we have had the appointment, we will call in at UJ's house nearby for a cup of tea, and then pootle home.  We estimate that we will be home by lunchtime.  It is raining this morning, so there is not going to be a lot to hang around anywhere for, so I think that we will come straight home from UJ's house.This afternoon, the FH has to take the Fiesta back to the MOT station to see if the mechanic has got it right and fixed the problem which caused it to fail last week.  When he has done that, I can tax it tomorrow, when we have the MOT certificate.  I will be popping to the chapel this afternoon for an hour or so, and then we have visitors coming for tea.  T&G are a brother and sister pair which live nearby and who are dear friends of ours.  She is a year behind the YFG at school, and the boy will be going up to secondary school in September, but he has been coming to gymnastics for years and I am very fond of him - he is a lovely little boy and he gets on well with the FH too as they both love watching action films.  If I had had a son, this little chap would have been just the ticket!  They are coming to tea so we have got sausage and mash on the menu, one of their favourites, and then I will make a cake for pudding.  I imagine that they may play on the Wii with the girls, watch some tv or just chat together for some time.  The YFG may get a board game out as they like to do that too [I hate board games - my guilty secret!].UJ inspected my garden work when he was here yesterday and I seem to have passed muster, which pleased me!  He also brought some more asparagus, a couple of lettuces and half a sack of potatoes.  I am finding that leek and potato soup is a more economical lunch for me, so I am going to make more of that, and bought some leeks yesterday in Lidl, when I went to pick the girls up from the station on their return from Cambridge.  They had been to the Grand Arcade, mooched across to the Grafton Centre, raided Primark, got lost in Mill Road and eventually got back to the station in time to catch the 3pm train, so we were back here by 4pm, inspecting the YFG's blisters and admiring their purchases.  Today, the YFG has to sort out her room - she wanted a piece of furniture from the spare room which meant me having to clear that out yesterday to extricate the piece, so now she has to put her room back together today....I suspect that when we leave, they will still be sleeping though!"},

{"title": "How does the garden grow?", "date": "Sunday 26 May 2013", "text": "We have enjoyed another very fine day here in the Fens, and the garden is looking much better for it.  I had a cuppa when I got back from chapel, and then I got stuck in to the gardening again, and have been at it just about all day.The beetroot rows look better for some weeding.The chicks enjoyed another day in the sunshine and leapt about in the run, stretching their little wings!Six courgette plants have been planted out, and marshalling the edges of the bed are some Little Gem lettuces in a nice straight line...This empty looking bed represents hours of work!  It was a mass of grass this time last year and I abandoned it last summer as I just didn't have time to deal with it.  UJ sprayed it with weedkiller for me, and the grass has died off, and I have spent hours today digging out all the roots of twitch grass from half of this bed.  I have now sown three more rows of beetroot and three rows of dwarf beans.The peas need staking, but that will be a job for tomorrow.Some runner beans planted up in a small bed.  I'm not good with wigwams, but the EFG helped me with this one and we think it should hold up!And this was the EFG's experiment of the day.  She wanted to dye the shoes but thought she would tie-dye an old white polo shirt as well, and I told her to bung this tea towel in as well - it was rather stained so it is now looking much better in a fetching shade of Harrod's green.  I realised I had done enough by 6pm, so I stopped and cooked the supper.  Then I had a shower and have spent the last couple of hours watching tv and finishing off another woolly hat.  Just got to sew the seam up and it will be in the bag with all the others.And the best bit?  The weather forecast promises some sun again tomorrow - so I can get a little more gardening done, and the housework and ironing will just have to wait for rain!"},

{"title": "Shopping and meal plan", "date": "Monday 20 May 2013", "text": "I started this morning with a rummage around the cupboards and the freezers.  A slight oversight on my part has reduced the weekly budget for the next three weeks to £71.50 instead of the £90 odd we originally had - a bill arrived that I had forgotten about!So, with money already allocated for Piano, the FH's lunch club and church, and then spends yesterday amounting to £12.50 for a new pair of school shoes from Asda for the YFG and personalisation of her gym comp T-shirt, we are down to £39 for the week......A meal plan soon emerged, with little shopping really required.Today - Leek and potato soup, served with hot sausage rolls [family] or pitta bread [me].  The soup and the sausage rolls were all in the freezer - so not a penny spent there.Tuesday - Corned beef hash - we have corned beef, veg, and potatoes all in stock and all I needed for this was some chopped tomatoes at 31p.Wednesday  - Tuna pasta bake - we have heaps of pasta, some condensed celery soup and lots of frozen veg in store for this.  All I needed was a tin of sweetcorn and some tuna.  I won't be able to eat this, but I hope to spirit away a portion of corned beef hash to keep for Wednesday!Thursday - Sweet and sour chicken - we have sauce in the cupboard with rice, and the chicken thighs are in the freezer.  Friday - Baked potatoes with cheese and beans - I have a veritable baked bean mountain in the store and it is time some of it was eaten!  The FH will likely add a touch of curry powder to his beans too.  I will just have beans, and no cheese.  There will be salad, perhaps, if there is any left!Saturday - Roast chicken dinner - there is a large chicken in the freezer which will make enough for two days here - with roasties, perhaps a Yorkshire pud, and lots of veg and gravy on Saturday and then...Sunday - Chicken leftovers - either chicken risotto or a chicken and veg pie topped with mash.  I'll have the risotto for sure and the others will either join me or get the pie.And with that in mind, I went shopping, armed with a list!In Lidl, I bought cheese, chocolate for the YFG, tuna, sweetcorn, bananas, apples, lettuce, bread and cat food.  Total spend in there was £11.25.In Sainsbury's, I chose lunchbox cakes and shampoo for the YFG, some treats for me on special offer, bagels for the EFG's lunchbox, along with ham for them both, chopped tomatoes for the corned beef hash, and Vitality drinks for the FH - with all the medication he is on, he seems to benefit from some friendly bacteria in there too!  Total spend £14.36.I could have managed without the treats, and the YFG could have had some home made snacks in her lunchboxes, but this week is a rest week for me, with no gymnastics, and after yesterday, I just wanted a little break!  I did ask her whether she wanted me to make anything today, but she is feeling worn out from yesterday too, and suffering with a cold, so she didn't care to comment...The other spend whilst we were out was a new watch battery for the FH, at £5.By my calculation, that leaves us with just £8.39 for anything else we need this week at all.  Shouldn't be food anyway!Apologies for the lack of post yesterday - by the time I got home from the gym competition last night, I was shattered.  There was just time to make a speedy supper [two and a half leftover sausages, chopped and cooked in a pan with a tin of tomatoes and some onion gravy powder, served over pasta - for the gang, and a tuna pitta for me!] before I watched Case Histories, and went to bed! (image from amazon.com)The gymnastics competition was held in the north of the Fens, hosted by a club there, and there were several clubs in the competition - one from Norfolk, one from south Lincolnshire, and one from Peterborough joined us at the host club to make up five clubs on the day.  It would be a lie to say that the competition was stiff, especially at the lower levels.  There were little six year olds being coaxed and coached through their routines by their coaches, gymnasts bursting into tears because they couldn't remember what they were supposed to be doing, and it was all very relaxed and forgiving - children got another go if needed.In several categories, our gymnasts were only competing against other gymnasts from our own club, so the competition was good in a sense because we do push them to high standards, and we don't enter children for competition until they are ready.  We were congratulated by one judge in particular on the standard our children achieved on her piece of apparatus, which gave us all a boost!At the higher levels, where the YFG was competing, the standards shot up.  Even so, she was competing against only three other gymnasts, two from our club and one from Norfolk.  Our three took the medals, with the YFG getting the Gold [proud mummy moment] and the more experienced of the other two getting the silver.  The third placed gymnast has only been with us since September, and had only done Floor and Vault at school prior to that, so we are very pleased with the way she has developed on Bars and Beam to be able to enter a competition already.It was inspiring for us and for the girls to be able to watch other gymnasts doing more complicated moves that they will need to master before next year as they all need to move up a level if we do that competition again.  The total medal haul for the club was impressive, and we were very proud of all 19 of the gymnasts we took."},
{"title": "Crunching the numbers", "date": "Saturday 18 May 2013", "text": "Following on from this post about budgeting, I have this morning just considered our budget for the next three weeks. (image from en.wikipedia.org)We start with what we have got [the balance in the bank and any cash], add on what is expected in the next week, and have a total from those figures.  Then I look at what demands there are on that money: quite a few this time - taxing and MOT for the Fiesta [£205], and the bills that are due between now and the 7th June [£250.60], and my NI bill [£68.90].I take that second total away from the first, and it leaves me with a decent amount.  BUT I have to deduct the amount I still need to put into savings from that [£550] and that leaves us with just short of £95 a week for the next three weeks.  And that is for all discretionary spending - food, fuel, activities, donations, medicines, gardening bits, gifts, toiletries, etc....anything that is not a direct debit or a previously considered bill.....Out of that weekly amount I know that I have to give the FH £4.50 for his lunch club, and the YFG will have a £10.50 piano lesson two weeks out of the three [one is half-term] and our church giving will also come out of it [usually £5].  That leaves us with £20 spent most weeks before we actually start eating and driving the car.  I know that I put diesel in my car last week so it won't need any this week, but it will be in need of a top-up next week, so that will have to be taken into account. Given that I have fairly good store cupboards, I think that our food spending could be covered easily by about £40 a week, so I am fairly confident that the savings goal will be achieved.  But all it needs is the Fiesta to fail the MOT to put a spanner in the works, but we will take each event as it comes and just wait to see what happens.  It runs well, is well maintained and looked after and there are no strange noises, so fingers crossed!"},

One doesn't have time to get bored, I'll say!The girls at gym have a competition on Sunday, so I won't be at church but the congregation has a DIY Sunday this week (called a \"local arrangement\" where the church has to sort out the service or get a preacher themselves - we usually DIY) and another lady is doing the service this week as I won't be there to do it because of the gym competition.  She has asked for some help, so I also need to look at the readings and see if the grey cells can come up with anything for her to do.  It is always different preparing something for someone else to deliver from doing it for yourself as I know that on the day I can change the words slightly or even improvise a little if I am led to change what I had prepared.I had better get on.  The FH has had his first batch of pills so he can have his breakfast now, then I will go and do the chooks, and get on with the day.  It is not raining here this morning but it is rather chilly.  Hoping that it is warmer where some of you are at least.  Have a good day xx"},

{"title": "A good day at work", "date": "Monday 13 May 2013", "text": "Yesterday's service went really well and things happened that I hadn't planned but which suited the message perfectly - and that can only have been God's hand on my work. The planning and preparation I put into that service was a little bit more than usual, for some reason, but I felt that that congregation, yesterday, needed a very strong message.  I haven't a clue what has been happening there [one of the little problems with Methodist preaching is that you get sent to congregations you don't know that well] but I felt that there was a need to hear something strong about coming together in God's love, and about that being a Choice. (image from goodsalt.com)It tied in well with the reading from Acts 16 about Paul & Silas in prison in Philippi, and then the earthquake breaking their chains so that they were free, but they Chose not to leave. I put the hymn \"Bind us together\" into the service, because it fitted in extremely well with the message.  The congregration have the words projected onto the wall above the preacher's head, but I felt that I had to use the hymn book otherwise I would be turning my back on the congregation to read the words from the wall.  I looked down into my hymn book for a minute to find the hymn, and when I looked up, they had all moved around the church in order to sing the hymn holding hands in a huge circle.  I quickly stepped over to join in, and it was very moving.  So much so, that after the sermon, I asked the organist to play another chorus of the hymn and we all held hands again.  I sang that chorus with tears in my eyes.I love Ann Voskamp's image of the people of Christ being his Body [nothing new in that] but not his estate - and I used that image yesterday, telling the people that we are the Body, held together with nerve and sinew, not kept apart by barbed wire fences, separated by ditches and dry stone walls.  There is a need, I believe, in that church yesterday for some pulling together.  I don't know why.  But that was what I was called to preach.And the most gracious blessing is that the congregation told me afterwards that I was right.  \"That was a message for me,\" said one woman; \"I will remember that service for a long time,\" said another, and yet another said, \"We needed that.\"  It was the women who told me what they felt, the men were quieter, but I think that they felt something too.  No one told me why, no one mentioned what had been happening there, or why that word was needed there yesterday, and I did not feel it right to ask. They were appreciative and welcoming of the Word.  And that was enough."},
{"title": "Shopping surprises", "date": "Sunday 12 May 2013", "text": "It may not come as a surprise to some of you, but this T challenge is beginning to change the way that I am shopping. I know my prices pretty well, and I am not able to match the T prices in many of the local shops - yet!  I had a shock when I wanted more baking margerine yesterday to find that Sainsbury's here only offered me Stork at £2/kilo when I have been used to buying T's own brand at £2.odd for 2kg.  I left the Stork on the shelf and thought that we would manage with the little tub of Vitalite in the fridge till I can shop around a little more.I am shopping more carefully because I am trying to shop around, so I am picking up what I know are well-priced items in one shop but not buying things that day that I know I can get cheaper elsewhere on another day.  Rarely have I got time at the moment to visit three or four shops on the same day, but over the course of a week or two, I seem to be hitting them all - the Co-op after the FH has his anti-coagulation appointment at the local cottage hospital, Lidl whilst the YFG has her piano lesson on a Thursday and Sainsbury on a Saturday sometimes.  Occasionally I can fit in a visit to the B&M Discount store where they sell cheaper tinned tomatoes and other items we buy now and again.I still have plans to visit a butcher in a village a little farther distant, but I need to get the freezer stocks lowered a little before I can do that, because I intend to buy a month's worth of meat, because of the distance I am going to travel to go there specifically.  The meat there is of excellent quality and the prices have always been competitive, so I am sure that this is worth at least a month's trial. It has been a busy day today, taking a chapel service this morning in a lovely riverside Norfolk village just over the border and then going on to a gym to train with some girls on a sprung floor so that they have the feel of it for next week's competition; we don't have such luxuries at our gym, so we hired one elsewhere for the afternoon.  Now I am home to ironing of school uniform and the cooking of supper."},
{"title": "Chick news", "date": "Saturday 11 May 2013", "text": "We have an invalid chick whose feet have not opened up properly and he seems to be hobbling around on his \"knees\" so we have a separate box for him and one that just hatched today who are both weaker than the other older chicks.  The main gang are getting feisty and growing well - more photos to come tomorrow.Between gymnastics, shopping [at Sainsbury] and preparing my service for tomorrow, I haven't had a minute for much else - apart from watching a tremendous storm we had here this afternoon - the rain was terrible and then it hailed as well!  More updates tomorrow on the chicks and the shopping...I posted back here about the local secondary schools moving to online suppliers of school uniform. I have had a response from an Assistant Principal at the school, which was not very encouraging.  He did take on board the comments I made about access for people without the internet or without the means to pay on the internet, and said he would raise those issues.I was told that the uniform is \"much better quality\" than that available in the supermarkets.  Honestly, though, for those of us trying to keep to a budget, we are not that bothered about buying high quality items of clothing that we know our children will have grown out of within six months to a year.  We expect to have to buy new clothes for school most years, so unless they are going to start operating a nearly-new shop, I will have little interest in such high quality goods.I was also informed that the children all have to wear logo'd polo shirts in the summer because \"around 5%\" of current pupils are coming to school wearing polo shirts with fashion logos on them like Nike and SuperDry.  Righto then, so because the school cannot deal with 5% of the children, the other 95% of the parents have to pay £7.50+ for polo shirts, instead of being able to send our children to school in the \"2 for £5\" plain white ones.  Seems entirely sensible! [Hope you are feeling the heavy sarcasm here!]And today's disturbing news?The shop on the high street that was our main supplier, albeit unofficially, but recognised by the schools because they used to invite them to display their goods at new intake evenings, is to close at the end of term, such has been the impact on their business.  I will be in there this week to buy a couple more jumpers for the YFG, and another tie, and perhaps some shorts for PE.  Thank goodness that this new uniform is only optional for the YFG as she will be in Y10 when they go back in September.It is a sad reflection of our times, I think, and a trend which is only set to continue.(image from commons.wikipedia.org)Many thanks to Frantic as she posted a link to an offer for a Family & Friends railcard, free for two months. I have just applied, and it should be through by the end of the month.  Perfect for a trip out a half term if it gets here early, but we will also have a week of the summer holidays before it expires.  The EFG also wants to go to some university open days, so I may be able to make use of it on those days, if the YFG comes along for the ride - I need one child aged 5-15 with me in order to use it....Hop over to Frantic's Antics, click on the link at the bottom of that post, and grab one for your family too, if you think you may be able to use it - free is the best price!"},

There may be more to come during today, but I wouldn't think any more will hatch after today.  The YFG is quite entranced, and the EFG and I sat and took photos last night, and marvelled over the miracle which turned eggs which we would have eaten into the most beautiful little birds in just three weeks!  God really is good to us, and I have been giving thanks for the miracle of creation today."},

I also enjoyed revisiting Our Rural Dream which is a really fascinating account of a family as they begin their new life on a smallholding in Lincolnshire.  This kind of life is a step or two beyond what we are able to achieve here, with our limitations, but I love to read about what others can do. The third is an inspiring money-saving site called The Prudent Homemaker, who also has a blog and a FB page where she posts tips and hints about frugal places to shop and meals to create.  This woman has an interesting story of overcoming some really hard times through having a well-stocked pantry, and she shares recipes and ideas to live in a comfortable home on a budget."},
{"title": "Monitoring on Mondays", "date": "Monday 6 May 2013", "text": "(image from guardian.co.uk)Bank Holiday or not, I have still done my Monday Monitoring of the electricity meter and the bank accounts. We are using about 17 units of electricity a day at the moment, which is okay for us.  Our weekly average hovers between 15 and 17 units a day, and this week, and the previous couple, we have been up towards the top end of this range, but I am not worried as I have been running the incubator for the hatching eggs and I know that that is an extra short-term appliance.The bank accounts are not looking much changed - as I have already posted, we have no more income until the 10th, which is still a few days away, so we haven't had the opportunity to save much since last Monday, although my YouGov account is now just £1 away from paying out, and I have a lot of points in the Shop&Scan reward account which I could exchange for vouchers now.  I'm going to save them up as I know that the girls will start to think about their August birthdays soon, and I will be able to spend those vouchers on items for their gifts at Amazon.Spending for this week is probably going to be limited to fruit and veg.  We have plenty of meat and fish in the freezer, and the makings of meals in the store cupboard, but the fruit bowl is almost empty.  Not the end of the world, but we do enjoy apples, bananas and oranges most days between us.  The FH is quite keen on stewed fruit, but the rest of us are not so enthused."},

{"title": "A spot of shopping", "date": "Thursday 2 May 2013", "text": "Having to go to one town to pick up the girls and then go to the other to take the YFG to the piano lesson, I have had the opportunity to visit two supermarkets today without incurring any extra fuel costs.  I popped into the first one, the Co-op, as I had twenty minutes to kill - I got ahead of myself this afternoon!  The YFG is particular about bananas being tinged with green and they usually have some in the Co-op, so I thought I'd have a look.  No luck there!(image from co-operativefood.co.uk)After dropping the YFG at the piano teacher's house, I had only half an hour, so I went to the library and picked up a couple of Jeffrey Archer novels, and asked about Jackson Brodie audiobooks - they didn't have any but they can order them in if I decide which one I want to listen to - so I'll have to look on Amazon and see what the options are and then I can order them from the library next week.  I hadn't realised that Jason Isaacs had recorded the audiobooks prior to starring in the TV series - which is coming back very soon!  Can't wait...(image from kateatkinson.co.uk)Just to keep me going till it is on again!(image from j-sainsbury.co.uk)Once we had retrieved the YFG, we were able to pop into Sainsbury's.  I had an order from the steward at the chapel for bread, cheese and a fruit pie for tomorrow's Worship Lunch, and I was still looking for those elusive bananas.  Alas, the ones in the shop were more suited to making banana bread, so I left them.I spent the morning in school, cataloguing more books, and since the weather was so glorious again today, I cycled to the school and back.  I had left washing on the line, so I was able to get it in when I came home at lunch time, and then I popped off to the chapel for the afternoon club.  We sat outside in the sunshine in the courtyard garden and soaked up the vitamin D.  I knitted and the other ladies were doing a jigsaw.I do hope you are getting your share of this lovely weather - my peas are growing furiously in the garden, and the pepper seedlings have emerged at last.  Pricking out tomato seedlings will be on the agenda for the weekend, and the radio presenter today seemed to be of the opinion that the good weather might last over the Bank Holiday - what a delight that would be.  We have a quiz at the chapel on Saturday evening and UJ is coming over on Sunday, so I am hoping for a relaxing weekend all round."},
{"title": "A day at home", "date": "Wednesday 1 May 2013", "text": "Days at home are relatively infrequent at the moment, but I managed to spend most of the day busy doing things here, and enjoying the lovely weather into the bargain! (image from apps.rhs.org.uk)UJ came over to the lunch club and brought his tree loppers with him, so I was able to use them to cut back my lavender hedge this afternoon, in the sun, which was beautiful.  I thought that the smell of the lavender might make me drowsy but I managed to stay awake and get it some of it done.  I filled the brown wheely bin, and both of my compost bins with the clippings, so I left the front hedge to do in a couple of weeks when the brown bin has been emptied!  My lavender is rather overgrown, like this in the RHS picture above, so it needed quite a drastic haircut.  I have cut the sides, and now I have to trim the thinner top section with the secateurs.  I hope it works, as the other option will only be to remove the whole lot and start again; I really don't want to go that far!All day I felt like I was rebooting the washing machine, and I took advantage of the weather to change my bedsheets a few days ahead of schedule but the fragrance of outdoor line dried linen is well worth it. I did spend a little time at the desk, filling in forms and sending emails to enter 20 gymnasts into a competition, and then catching up with a couple of friends who had emailed. This afternoon, the FH and UJ sat outside and had a chinwag and I joined them for a cup of tea, then UJ came and helped me to find and repair a breach in the chook runs where a couple of breeding GPOs had escaped in to the general melee.  We sorted that out, and I collected the eggs - 19 from today's laying.  Making a cake for UJ to take home and one for tea used up 8, but we still have three trays to sell, so I am going to have to put a sign out on the gate tomorrow.Tonight we had a Governors' meeting and I had a lovely surprise in that the Head and the office manager gave me a lovely plant arrangement - they are kind - they said it was in recognition of the way I have continued to support the school throughout the upheavals and problems we have had at home this year.  It was such a surprise I was almost speechless, but it makes a very pretty addition to my kitchen windowsill, and I shall endeavour to keep it alive with love and water.....Final job of the day was to pick up the EFG from Guides and drop off some old magazines to a friend as she wants them for a craft project.  All that done, I am enjoying a glass of home made sloe gin and celebrating staying out of the shops today!Forcing myself into a less reliant relationship with a local supermarket chain which dominates our area is my target for the month.  A quick look at their store locator reveals 10 stores of varying sizes within 20 miles of my postcode!  Remembering that I have other options is the key, and getting out and about to make use of them is going to be my aim.(image from telegraph.co.uk)Research into other shops this last fortnight has shown me that there are bargains to be had in B&M, that Lidl's [as I already know] has most of what I need, and that Aldi is worth a visit occasionally.  Sainsbury's is an option, as is the Co-op, and I have three of those within 8 miles.  There are three butcher's shops in one town and one in the other, and there was an excellent butcher's van at the local car boot sale of a Sunday morning.  The fruit and veg at the car boot sale was a bit hit and miss last summer, so I got out of the habit of buying it, but it would be worth a look occasionally to see what the quality is like this year. Both local towns have markets that I could use, and the quality of fruit and veg in Lidl has always been quite good.(image from independent.co.uk)I have also given some thought to the other items we buy in the supermarket, like toiletries, stationery, cat food, household items, gardening bits and pieces, etc and tried to identify alternative sources for those.  It is all do-able.  It can be done. My feeling is that time is going to be the worst obstacle to this challenge and the one which I shall have to work hardest to overcome.  The bigger supermarkets stay open longer, and so I have been able to pop in at almost any time, quite frequently after a session of gymnastics, which end at 8pm [Tuesdays] and 7.30pm [Fridays].  Regular shops and market stalls are not open at that time of night and the butcher has long since cleaned his counters up and gone home.  The only day that I am in town and able to shop at these stores would be a Thursday when the YFG has her piano lesson, so that may have to become \"shopping\" day.  I miss the market completely in one town, but I could catch it late in the day in the other town, by which time the best of the produce will have been sold....I think that I may end up using smaller supermarkets for a lot of our shopping, with some use of smaller local shops where I can.  There is also the online retailer, Approved Foods, but having had a delivery from them relatively recently, I am unlikely to order this month, however tempting the emails they keep sending me.Let's see how it goes!"},
{"title": "Budgeting in the Fens", "date": "Tuesday 30 April 2013", "text": "Frugal Queen asked us yesterday to share our budgeting tips, so I thought you might be interested in how we make it through the month.  We are different from FQ in that our income comes in from different sources as we move through the month.  Some comes in monthly and others come in four weekly like the FH's Old age pension.  My income from selling chooks and coaching gymnastics comes in even more sporadically, according to when the poultry sales happen and when I invoice for the gym.  It is all a bit less convenient than one payment coming in at the end of each month.My lovely chooks enjoying the sunshine one year.  At the end of each month, I round things up and look at where we are and how much we have saved or spent, and look at our net worth.  Each Monday, I look at all the accounts and see how things are progressing for the month, and that helps to keep us on track.  Every time I spend anything, I write it down on sheets in my household management folder.  There is a sheet for each month filed behind the calendar sheet for the month, and it is divided up into various categories - Fuel, Food, Gardening, cleaning, Toiletries, Household items, Stationery&Ink, Clothes, Activities.......and \"Other\"!  I track our spending in each category over each month, and try to keep to a budget figure for each category.All our Direct Debits come out of one bank account, with the exception of one mobile phone payment which is made on a credit card.  I know when the DDs are coming out, and by the time they come out, I have received notification of how much they will be if they are variable ones, like the BT one - this varies according to the calls we make, but it is between £21 and £23 a month.I sat down this morning and mapped out the spending for the next two weeks.  We have a positive balance in the current account, and I can plan out all the DDs that are coming out before we get any more income.  I also know what other payments I need to make, like the YFG's piano lessons, for which I know I will withdraw the cash each week.  It wasn't a surprise this morning when I worked out that we have £34.65 spare to last through to the 10th May.  That is for everything we might want to buy - food, fuel, toiletries, anything! However, that is after I have paid the savings account at the end of April, and I have taken all the bills/DDs/commitments into consideration for the next two weeks.  I have also been shopping at the end of last week and the store cupboards and freezers are well stocked.  I filled up my car with diesel on Saturday afternoon too.  There should be little that we actually NEED over the next two weeks, apart from perhaps some fresh fruit and veg.  Half of £34 is £17 and I am sure that I won't spend all of that this week on fruit and veg. Each week, I will do this exercise again, and consider the income and expenditure for the week, how much I am going to put into savings, and what bills need to be paid that week.  Then I know to the penny what I have left over for other spending. The FH has put a spanner in the works slightly in that he needs a tooth extracting and the only appointment he could get is next Wednesday - an extraction is going to cost in the region of £60, so I will be temporarily borrowing that from the Travel Fund [for the EFG's season ticket for school], and paying it back on the 10th May.  I am lucky that we are a position to do that and that we are not really living from one payment to the next.Growing our own veg in the spring and summer certainly helps the budget.So why do I do this?  Because the tighter the rein on the money, the more we can save.  The harder I work at this, the harder I can make the money work, too.  I can buy things in bulk and make savings which I would not achieve by leaving the money sitting in the bank.  I am reducing our discretionary spending and we are all spending less on \"wants\" and thinking more responsibly about \"needs\" too.   Stashing away the yellow-stickered items in the freezer is a boost to the budget. Keeping a good store-cupboard helps me to avoid those expensive trips to the shops for just one item...and it is too far to keep going to town for one or two things!But life is also about Fun and Enjoyment, and we have some of that too!  We use income I earn from YouGov towards days out through our Sealed Pot, which will soon get a £50 boost when I have done £2's worth of more surveys, and the Shop&Scan rewards are being shared with the girls so that they can choose a treat from Amazon occasionally.  We also use Nectar points and Clubcard rewards to enjoy trips to the cinema and to treat ourselves in Sainsbury's to a few extra bits and pieces at Christmas. Avoiding convenience foods and cooking from scratch really helps us to keep food costs under control.Budgeting is a key part of our frugality, but being frugal isn't about being mean.  It is about being careful with our resources and making every penny count!"},
{"title": "Savings report - end of April", "date": "Monday 29 April 2013", "text": "Having studied T S Eliot for A level, I have to say that I didn't find April to be the \"cruellest month\" this year. We have had our ups and downs with the FH being re-admitted to hospital, but overall, it hasn't been too bad.  The best thing is that the FH came out of hospital a lot fitter this time, and he has continued with his improvement.(image from vanquis.co.uk)Shame that I can't be as positive about the savings!  I didn't hit the target for the month, by about £35, although in the grand scheme of things, I don't think that is much to complain about.  Achieving £715 this month, in addition to the previous three months' achievements, puts us at a monthly average for the first four months of 2013 of £734, which is nothing to be ashamed of!  I also had an interest payment on my ISA this month, so our overall net worth is increasing nicely.The target for May will remain the same, and there are some bills coming in which will mean that it will continue to be a challenge to do this.  We have the Fiesta to tax and MOT this month, and the National Trust membership is also due (single parent with children membership as the FH is not interested in old houses, he says!).  This last year I have considered my membership as a donation to the national heritage as I have not been able to visit a single NT property, which has saddened me somewhat - so we must go somewhere this year, even if it is just to one of our old favourites:Oxburgh (top) and Wimpole Halls - both relatively local to us, and favourite days out!"},

{"title": "Thoughts on shopping", "date": "Saturday 27 April 2013", "text": "Having decided that the T-Challenge is going to happen in May, I went there on Thursday after the YFG's piano lesson with the intention of picking up the fruit and veg we needed to keep us going over the weekend, and using up a couple of vouchers I had before May.I am sitting here with the receipt on my lap, and I thought I would share some of our shopping strategies, which I am sure that many of you already use, but might be useful for one or two people, I hope.We shop for two reasons - the first is for fresh items: fruit and veg, cheese, probiotic drinks for the FH, and some cold meats.  The second is to re-stock the pantry and the freezer with items that are on sale, or at a very good price which I think may not last!Let's introduce some codes here or I am going to be typing out the same thing again and again:TV = Tesco Value, T = Tesco Own BrandWe bought:T Honey-Nut cornflakes (to restock - cheaper than the branded, and the best value size was purchased by comparing the cost per 100g on the shelf labels)Almond Slices by that famous Baker, Mr K - there were four packets of these at less than half price because that day was their \"best before\" date - but we know that they are still perfectly edible.  I bought these to take to the Craft Club at the chapel because I hadn't had time to make any cakes.Wholebake Bar - these are the ones I am going to buy in bulk from the manufacturer in future.Bagels - a branded pack at less that half the RRP because they were also going to pass the use-by.  For the EFG.T Meat - mince, chicken livers, gammon - all at good prices and bought because we have run out in the freezer.  I bought two packs of chicken livers because they are cheap at 99p a pack and the shops in this area rarely seem to stock them.  See them, buy them here!White sliced loaf - T a reduced white loaf for the YFG's sandwiches.  My breadmakers are both to pot and so at the moment I buy up whatever sliced loaves I find on the reduced stands, and hardly ever buy it full price.TV Punched pockets 50 - for the EFG's coursework - 50 pockets for 55p. Can't complain.Various fruit/veg items - apples, bananas, grapes, broccoli T Cold meats - all the cold meats are bought on the offers where two packets purchased together make each individual packet cheaper.  The girls enjoy sandwiches and bagels for school each day so two packs are easily used up in a week. T Lever arch files - I found three very fancy lever arch files in a clearance bin for £1 each.  I know that they had been over £3 each when they came in to the store and I had liked them!  We use a lot of folders and files here for school and coursework, so they are now stashed away ready for use when one of us needs an extra file.  They may also get used as gifts as they are so nice.Shampoo - the EFG has a taste for expensive shampoo and she found one of her favourite brands on offer at £3.79 a bottle or £4 for two bottles.  Still more than I want to pay for shampoo so she makes a contribution, but we buy the shampoo!TV Corned beef - prices for this have varied so much lately and branded CB is over £2 a tin, and TV was £1.80odd until recently.  Since it has dropped to £1.54 a tin, I buy a tin or two each time I shop and now have quite a few in the store cupboard.  This is a good protein, easily stored with a long shelf life and there is a lot that can be done to make varied meals once the tin is opened so it is no ill store, as Mum would have said!Ketchup - the branded stuff, I'm afraid!  Again, this is often on offer, so I bought two £2.19 packs for £3 and into the stores it went.TV Pasta sauce - the family like this on pasta (!) for a quick and easy meal, sometimes with some veg and some cheese, sometimes just on its own, or with some tuna added.  Based on the recent experiences with the other TV sauces going up to 79p, I am buying this whilst it is available at 39p because I know it will get eaten and they like it.  I have got 6 jars now, so will probably stop.T Polo shirts - the YFG is now in summer uniform and needed a couple of new polo shirts for school so we found some in the shop, cheap at £2.50 each and well enough made to last a growing teenager until she grows out of them!The benefit of this kind of shopping is that I stock up on sales and opportunities so that I can keep my store cupboards full and my freezers well stocked. Then my meal planning happens based on what I have found on good deals and stashed away, and not on what I am tempted by in the shops.  It certainly helps with our budget, but I know that other people do it differently - each to their own as long as we try to keep out of debt, eh?!"},

I'm still working on the details of this challenge, and I think that it will need a bit more consideration before I launch it on 1st May, but I am certain that it is a goer, and I will share it with you.The first thing I am going to do towards it later this week is to make a master list of all items we buy, and look at online comparison sites to see what other supermarkets and shops charge.  It'll be a place to start.I'd be glad to hear your ideas for staying away from supermarkets in general..."},

Slightly different shape to the jars.  79p one is in the same shape jar that the mid-range one used to be in.  That little flash sign on the right which says \"New recipe\" - cynical of me, but I am guessing that the Everyday Value is now using the recipe for the mid-range one.So this is price increases by stealth.  Where there used to be three tiers of pricing, there are now two.  There used to be Top of the Range Uncle Ben's at over £1/jar, then the own brand mid-range at 79p and the Value at 29p.  Now the Value one has been wiped out in all but name.Time I got the recipe out for Sweet and Sour sauce - I have an excellent one from Slimming World from years ago.  More and more people are noting price rises like this on the boards at the MSE forum but this is the first example I have found in the foods we regularly buy."},

{"title": "Frugal school uniform - not!", "date": "Saturday 20 April 2013", "text": "I went to the Knit and natter yesterday morning, and one of the ladies always has a local paper there, and we all have a read!  I was shocked to read on the front pages that the local secondary schools are Both changing their suppliers of school uniform to an online-only arrangement.  A local firm in the town has supplied both for years, and has saved my life on several occasions, when one or other of the girls has come home from school and said that they have lost an item - I have been able to dash into the shop and buy a replacement for the next day.  The shop is not expensive, and there has been some competition in that there was a shop in the other nearby town that sold our school uniform as well.(image from which.co.uk) Whilst I applaud both schools for their efforts to improve the standards of the uniforms that the students are wearing, our school has changed the uniform so that most of the items now have to have a logo on them, and are only available from this retailer online; even though there is an option to have the goods supplied to the families by a local retailer, they appear to have chosen online-only.  I think that this is misguided on so many levels:no competition so parents are not protected from price hikes as and when the company feels the need.no immediate source of clothing/items - items may well take several days to arrive.no local source of itemsno source of items which can be bought for cash.a delivery charge on all orders under £35 payment must be made by credit or debit cards so what about those people in bankruptcy arrangements who have only perhaps access to cash cards?Online - so what about those people who either do not have internet access or struggle to use a computer - is there going to be support in place for those people to access the uniform?the schools get support from the local community, so where is their support for their local community retailers?  I was devastated when the local book shop closed down because I had often (monthly, probably!) got them to order in books for me, and loved to browse the shelves - this could have a serious impact on yet another local retailer.I have put these concerns in an email I am drafting to the Principal's assistant - I will be sending it in on Monday when I have had a good think about what issues to ask for clarification on over the weekend.Update on Monday - I have sent the email and await their response...I'll let you know!"},

{"title": "End of March finances", "date": "Monday 1 April 2013", "text": "March has been a tricky month, and one I have to say that I am glad to see the back of it this year.  It has been a surprise, somehow, that we managed to actually save over target, when we had the onslaught of bills to pay that had arisen!Extra expenses this month:£60 glasses for the YFG£328.60 Heating oil£67.20 Boiler service£223.80 Skoda bill£57.62 Bike service for EFG£17.00 Dentist£20.00 Comic Relief donation£7.99 HairdryerSome of those are routine and are in the annual budget, but are extras which have an impact in the month in which they fall.  Others, like the bike service and hairdryer, weren't planned, or expected.  We managed.The regular pots of spending held up pretty well:Chicken food, cat food, road fuel, activities, Lunch club and Stationery/ink all came in under budget.  It reflects that some of these are actually pitched too high (I never spend £10 in one month on cat food) and that some were low because of the FH's illness - he hasn't been out to the lunch club so that one is under budget.  Groceries was over budget at £320.45 (£300 is the budget) but that does include this weekend's \"beginning of the month\" shop, and is nowhere near as far over as it was last month - let's not mention how bad that was...Toiletries has been over budget again.  This one is perhaps not set high enough when I consider that there are three females in the house and the amount of STs and shower gel/shampoo etc that we get through.  I have also added a little to the loo roll mountain, as it had begin to deplete and I found a good deal!We managed to save £800 this month, which I am pretty well amazed at, although it does include some money that I earned from coaching.  Since I put it straight into savings instead of spending it, it is definitely money saved.And how will April fare, do I reckon?  We have another bill for the Skoda, but only £131 this time for the front suspension spring repair, and I don't anticipate too many extra bills this month, so I am hoping to be on track for a target £750 in the bank by the end of the month.  I had a little windfall this morning in that the interest was paid overnight on one of my savings accounts!  Although it would contribute a significant sum towards this month's goal, and it has of course increased our net worth, I am not going to include it in the savings for the month because that feels like cheating because I didn't do anything to save/earn that money this month - it is from interest on past endeavours.  Nice to have, all the same.The ISA allowance was used all up for this year, so I am currently saving into an account from which I can sweep the money over into the ISA on the 6th April.  I am going to look at using some of my Stocks&Shares ISA allowance this year to maximise the opportunity.  I have never done this before, and it might not even be called that any longer, so it will all be new to me.(image from bbc.co.uk)We are all looking forward to watching the new Easter Jonathan Creek mystery which starts in a minute or two, so I am going to make a cuppa and get my knitting sorted out - on to my fifth hat now.  Good night xx(image from play.com)I'm making April the month I move more!  I have several of Davina's fitness DVDs and I intend to make use of them, as well as walking more and getting a bit more toned.  After I lost weight last year, I definitely need to tone up and get fitter.  I don't intend to spend any more money as I have the DVDs to use, walking is free, I have boots to walk in, old clothes to exercise in, and plenty of water to drink.  I'd better get started!"},

I have two vouchers in hand, and I intend to use them both, probably on Saturday, but it is going to mean some careful planning and stocktaking before I spend!  I have my £5 Helping Hand voucher from Tesco which requires me to choose items to the value of £40 and then get £5 off at the till.  I also printed off the Lidl one for £5 when I choose £35 of items there.  So I have to think about what to buy in which shop, and do a plan!

{"title": "Bother?", "date": "Wednesday 20 March 2013", "text": "I'm thinking of Catherine Tate this morning and her character who keeps saying, \"I'm not bovvered,\" but actually, I am quite bothered!  It's an interesting word, when you think about the myriad of meanings it has. (image from telegraph.co.uk)We had the doctor out yesterday, and the FH apologised to him for being such a bother to him, and I felt like apologising for bothering him yet again, but the FH is worth it! The tummy upsets he is suffering led me to ring the nurse at Papworth to see if I could get any advice about helping to avoid the upsets by taking the medications with or without food, at certain times of the day, or foods which might aggravate the medications.  I had a long chat with a lovely lady called Bianca, and she asked some questions and worked out that the FH is not taking the right brand of his immunosuppressant drug.  He used to be on two different ones, but now that one of them has been discontinued, Papworth deem it imperative that he takes the original brand, and not a generic.  The GP's dispensary has been sending generics, and that may be contributing to the upset stomachs, especially since the dose has been doubled since he has been in hospital. I have been very pleased with the local surgery and all their help in this recent illness of the FH, and the doctor and nurses have bent over backwards to help him, and to support us, and I remain very grateful for all that they are doing.  I did feel a little bothered yesterday that perhaps I had upset the doctor as he doesn't seem very convinced that the FH needs this original brand of medication, but he is going along with it and phoned the surgery to get them to order some in for the FH.  There seemed to have been a lack of communication as the surgery and indeed, we, didn't know about this need for a particular brand of medication, so it is a good thing that I am persistent in trying to find out what is the best thing for the FH."},

{"title": "Sleepy weekend!", "date": "Sunday 17 March 2013", "text": "I have spent a couple of hours asleep each afternoon this weekend, and really felt the need of it.  I have some tingling sensations going on near one of my shoulder blades, and based on some old wives' tales I have heard from ladies in the church this morning,  I wouldn't be surprised to develop shingles this week or next.  T'would be the icing on the cake brought on by what have amounted to two quite stressful and tiring months, and the rest it would enforce is probably necessary.......but it will be blinking inconvenient if that truly is what it turns out to be.  There is no rash there at the moment, despite constant checking by the girls and the FH - I can't see the area which is tingling!There was Comic Relief on Friday.  The girls contributed in small ways through school fundraising, and then we made a family donation online.  I just couldn't not make some contribution to the malaria nets or the vaccination programmes in Africa, or the support for the vulnerable in this country.  The stories were heart-rending, and I hope that the fantastic amount raised really has an impact on the needs of all those people.  The school in the village dressed up in 80s gear for the day and the outfits were sensational - I was so impressed when I went in for a look around and to attend assembly. Yesterday afternoon, the YFG cooked risotto rather well, which I woke up just in time to eat, and today we have had sausages, which weren't on the plan, but that meal was driven by the FH rather fancying sausage and mash for his tea, so that is what I made!  For me, there was some leftover risotto and some sweet and sour chicken from the freezer. And the budget busting I mentioned on Friday.....the EFG's bike has had to be repaired, at the bike shop, at a cost of just under £60, which is well worth it, if it will help her to get some exercise.  The other problem is that the tv in the sitting room is dying slowly. Some days the remote control doesn't work, most days the DVD player won't work, and so we are beginning to research replacements but I have it on my list to look for a local TV repairman as well, as I would rather repair than replace.  I am really trying not to contribute to landfill if I possibly can.Dentist tomorrow - what joy!"},

{"title": "Vegetarian recipes", "date": "Sunday 10 March 2013", "text": "Since the horsemeat scandal, people have been looking more closely at their meat intake, and that has been us too.  Recently, just this week, the news has reported the dangers of eating too much processed meat, including what can be a frugal family meal, sausages.  There is a thread on MSE at the moment in the Old Style section, entitled, \"Can't afford to eat meat\" and so a combination of all of these has meant more of us looking for vegetarian meals.(image from bbcgoodfood.com)There are large sections of the internet devoted to vegetarianism, and indeed there are magazines and books available too.But I always think personal recommendations are best, so I was delighted to find a link on the MSE thread I mentioned above to a blog entitled, \"A girl called Jack\" where one can read the heart-rending story of Jack and her son, really struggling to survive on the most meagre of incomes, although she has a job now.  But she spends £10 a week to feed the two of them, eating mostly vegetarian meals, and mostly using Sainsbury's Basics range.  Do go and have a look in her recipe section - there are some great ideas there that I am going to be trying out for myself.  She has some recipes for soups there, and some interesting breads that I want to try.The \"trouble\" for me with vegetarianism is that if I give up meat, to add to my already dairy-free state, I actually become vegan...so I will never be giving up meat completely!  I do think that a couple of meat-less meals a week would do us good.Whether you dabble in vegetarianism  or you are a full-on vegetarian,  I'd be glad to hear your favourite recipes too."},

{"title": "Free health checks", "date": "Monday 25 February 2013", "text": "(image from buckinghamshire.nhs.uk)The FH may be weaker than normal, but I seem to be in robust health!  I have had a free NHS Health check tonight at our surgery.  The appointment was quite late, at 7.45pm, but I was in and out in less than the advertised 20 minutes.One nurse was testing the urine sample, taking blood out of my finger to test it for sugar levels and cholesterol, and then she weighed me and did my blood pressure.  The other nurse was firing questions at me from a computer screen, asking me about my family's medical history of heart disease and strokes, diabetes and cancer, as well as about my intake of fruit, vegetables and alcohol, and whether I had ever smoked.They were pretty pleased with me!  All the tests came back in the right levels, and my cholesterol is apparently very good at only 3.4, so I am definitely doing something right.  She weighed me with all my clothes [jeans, heavy sweatshirt, and walking boots] on, so I was a little more than I am on the scales here, and my BMI came in at 26, which is a bit more than ideal, but I am aware that I have more pounds to lose.They hope I am in a similar condition in five years' time - and so do I!The weekend has passed off successfully.  The FH has had a good couple of days where he has been feeling stronger, and the visitors we had yesterday afternoon cheered and entertained him for a couple of hours.  He has been up in the later mornings/early afternoons through until bedtime, which has been good.  The weight continues in a downward trend, indicating good water loss, so we are hoping that the doctors will be pleased with that.UJ also came to lunch yesterday, and seemed to enjoy the afternoon - my cousin, one of his other nieces, came over for the afternoon with her husband and her mother.  UJ's brother, my uncle, is not well either, and is waiting for an appointment at Papworth Hospital to have a pacemaker fitted.  It's all hearts at present!A lady at the chapel is being given a surprise party on Sunday for her 80th birthday, so we are hoping that the FH may be well enough to attend that next weekend, even if only for a little while.  It is just going to be an afternoon tea with some entertainment, so he shouldn't have to exert himself unduly.  That is our aim for this week.Financially, I have actually managed to increase our assets by £665 this month, so over the two months of the year so far, we have averaged £710, which is close to what I had targeted and I am very pleased with that.  I am still considering our charitable giving, and a couple of other things which will have a financial impact too.  Thanks for your comments."},
{"title": "Not all bad", "date": "Friday 22 February 2013", "text": "(image from en.wikipedia.org)We caught some of the segment this chap had on BBC Breakfast this morning, talking about hospital food.  He may have an excellent point, and the standards may have to be raised in many places, but James Martin and friends got the FH quite miffed this morning because the segment seemed to tar all the hospitals with the same brush.The FH has had some lovely dishes in Peterborough City Hospital, and plenty of food!  He had a good breakfast each morning, was offered snacks at mid morning and mid afternoon, and could have had two hot meals [lunch and dinner] each day.  Most days he opted for a cold sandwich or salad at tea time, but on one occasion, had a chicken curry at lunchtime and chased it down with shepherd's pie at tea time!Each ward there has a \"host\" who comes round to take the orders for meals, and then served it out to him.  These were friendly people who could guide him as to what was suitable from the menu to go with the restrictions the doctor had in place on sugar.  The meals were the main talking point for him when we visited as he would delight in telling us what he had been trying from the menu.Some hospitals are doing a great job!(image from bbc.co.uk)Coming towards the end of the month [already? Yes!] I can tell that we are not going to make the £750 target for savings this time.  Given the circumstances of the month and the extra expenses we have incurred, I am not surprised at all, and have decided to be grateful that I can achieve £500 and be satisfied with that.  It is still a sizeable sum, and will help us on our way.It helped a little this week to be able to insure the FH's little Fiesta for only £160 instead of the £193 originally quoted.  I tweaked the quote a little, reduced the annual mileage to 6000 miles, which is very generous for him - he probably does a lot less than that, actually, but that was as low as I dared to go this time - and that generated a better quote.  I have both cars on the same policy now with Aviva, and it has saved money over last year's costs, so I am pleased with that.BUT posts like this one from Ann Voskamp really made me think about our charitable giving this year.  Her writing moved me to tears yesterday and really challenged me to consider more carefully what I am doing.We do give money to charities in a variety of ways.  I make an annual donation to the Salvation Army at Christmas each year in memory of my mother - and it is a decent one, not just a pound or two.We donate in the offering plate to the chapel every Sunday morning, and even if we are not there on a Sunday, I make sure that the offering gets there one way or another.I make the cakes for the Friday morning Craft groups and the Thursday afternoon get togethers at the chapel, which means that food doesn't have to be bought in.  We regularly donate prizes for raffles and tombolas at chapel.We supported the Operation Christmas Child boxes last year, and intend to do so again this year, with various items bought and made.I am helping to support a child through the #ShareNiger project.We support fundraising at school for our partner school in Africa, for Comic Relief, and Children In Need.We leave bags of clothes out for roadside collections, and take bags to the local charity shops.But, do you know what?  I realised yesterday that this is all too comfortable, as Ann puts it.  It is easy, it is not that challenging, and it doesn't move us out of our comfort zone here in England.  I am not going to go on mission trips to Africa or South America or Asia, I am not going to do anything that dramatic.  BUT if I can put aside money each month for our future, surely I should be able to help someone to live NOW?  It seems hard to look through various charities and decide which one to support, but that is what I am going to have to do.  Do I go with Plan International, Save the Children, Compassion, Mary's Meals, or WaterAid?  How do I choose?  I looked at a website just yesterday which was asking me to choose a particular child to sponsor - I couldn't do it - choose one over all the others!  I'm going to pray over this this weekend and try to come to a decision.  If anyone has any advice to offer, I'd be pleased to read your comments.  Thank you."},

{"title": "A small hiccup", "date": "Saturday 16 February 2013", "text": "Yesterday the Fh spent the day largely asleep, and I began to get concerned that he wasn't actually as well as he had been the afternoon of his discharge.  Although the care at the hospital had been wonderful, I did feel that we could have had a little more support in the discharge process - what to expect, things to watch out for, potential problems etc.  I quietly rang our practice nurse at home, who had a quiet word with the doctor, at 8pm last night, and she came back to me with the advice to get the on call doctor out to have a check up.  I was immensely grateful that a doctor turned out at 10pm last night and came to look him over.  It was reassuring to know that he didn't find anything outstandingly wrong, and that he advised us to carry on as we were. Today the FH has had an afternoon downstairs by the fire, and one of the ladies from the church came and sat with him whilst I made a much-needed shopping trip to town.  The girls and I were out for about 2 and a half hours, and the lady from the church managed to keep him awake the whole time!  She did very well, and they put the world to rights between them.He has had rump steak and steamed veg for his supper, and retired to bed with the electric blanket on and the tv.  All the pills for the day are done, and we are looking forward to tomorrow.  Another day, and a step further into his recovery.I have tomorrow's sermon spinning around in my brain and I am struggling to get it down on paper - the FH suggested that since I have a clear idea of the message, I should just trust God and go without having written it all down.  I am not yet that confident in my own abilities and will be spending as long as it takes tonight to get it down on paper!  It has been developing in my mind since last Thursday and I really should have committed it to paper by now, but sermons seem to keep developing even  once I have them on paper, and it has been intriguing to see how far this one would go.  I know it will change even as I deliver it tomorrow, so I am not too worried, but I do need to get the bare bones of it down, even if it is just an outline!I hope you all have a lovely weekend, and enjoy the weather we are having in the UK at the moment - today was a glimmer of the spring that I hope is just around the corner..."},

I have been in touch with relatives and friends, and watched some tv.  The fire was lit for the first time since Wednesday, and we have had a cosy day in.I have had a look at some websites that I thought I might share with you, and see what you thought to them.  Some I like, and some I don't think suit me and our lifestyle.I think that Petrolprices is a useful tool to keep track of local prices if you have a number of suppliers in your area, but there is no sense in travelling extra miles to get fuel a few pence cheaper.  I do use Quidco quite often, especially when I am shopping around for insurance or larger purchases.  I also use TopCashBack for money back on shopping - if I am going to have to spend the money, I might as well get a little back if at all possible!Supersavvyme is an interesting one - some aspects of it I like, and some I am not so keen on - but it is well worth a trawl around it to pick out the gems and find the parts of it which are relevant to your life.I feel similarly ambivalent about Moneymagpie - if you can cope with the headline style of the home page, there is a lot in there but one could easily get distracted by \"47 ways to find a date\" instead of finding the really good stuff which you need to read if you are interested in saving money.  I think this one is another which is worthy of further investigation.I feel like I should be as the BBC and point out that there are other moneysaving websites available!  But some are not to my taste at all - the ones which still encourage you to spend, but to acquire the items using coupons and deals which just allow you to get the item a little cheaper.  Too many people will use the coupons and still put the balance on the credit cards, and not enough people are encouraging the world to go back to the basics and just not to buy if one doesn't have the money to pay!But, do you know what, I don't like any of these websites as much as I love the personal ones, written by MeanQueen, Frugal Queen and Sue, for example, where we hear about the realities of day to day life and get the personal touch.  There is a lot to be said for knowing that other people are living the experience and not just writing about it as journalists to do a day job.  Long live the real bloggers who practice what they preach.  They are an inspiration to us all.If you can recommend a \"real\" blogger who is not in my blogroll, and who you think I would like to read, please mention them in the comments and I will go and have a read.  I am always interested to find new blogs and would love to add new ones to the blogroll.  Thanks xx"},

The budget from last month looks surprisingly good!  Considering that I paid for a load of logs [£75], taxed the Skoda [£100] and insured it as well [£260], and still managed to get £755 or so into the savings pot, I am pleased to consider the first month of the new year a success.  I haven't bought a magazine, either - although I have picked up free ones in the supermarkets, including a new one in Sainsbury's about Living well for Less. There are areas where I still feel that I am spending too much, like on my own special gluten/wheat/dairy free  needs.  This is going to be TMI for some, but I have to eat a couple of seed bars each day to keep things moving - and I know this to my cost because I tried to cut back at the end of January when the budget was beginning to squeak - and the system got bunged up and then exploded.  I felt rather rough!  So there are a couple of ways of looking at this - carry on as I am, see if I can buy them in bulk and get them cheaper somewhere, or make my own.  That will be the experiment of the month...I am very healthy at the moment and pleased with the investment I made last year to see the homeopath, so this is a little hiccup in the grand scheme of things.  I am feeling so much better in lots of ways.  I am a worthwhile investment, so I shouldn't be too hard on myself.I have made a great start to the February house cleaning and tidying challenge.  I have cleared out our bedroom, found the carpet under the dust and fluff and rubbish/clutter, and sorted out my clothes.  Going from a size 18/20 to a 14/16 has meant that there are lots of clothes which are too big - so I have 10 supermarket bags of clothes to take to the charity shops this week, and my side of the wardrobe is looking rather less stuffed than it did.  I have brought two boxes of books back downstairs, and I have had three bags of rubbish out as well.  I am pleased with my morning's work in there. I have also finished and typed up the next unit in the Faith & Worship course I am doing, and it has been emailed off to the tutor tonight.  It marks the halfway point - unit 9 out of 18!Hope you have all had a good day xx"},

{"title": "Shopping update", "date": "Wednesday 23 January 2013", "text": "(image from eatingwell.com)In need of some fruit and veg, I went to the Co-op after a school meeting last night.On the receipt are:Frozen broccoli £1.59Frozen cauliflower £1.50Frozen green beans £1.29Fresh broccoli £1.15Carrots £0.50Fairtrade Bananas £1.601kg box of clementines £3.00That makes a total spend of £10.72 on those items.I do find that the Co-op is more expensive than the other supermarkets - the fresh broccoli would have been quite a bit less in Tesco although not a lot less in Sainsbury's, and the bananas would have been £1 in Tesco. The frozen beans are cheaper though, by about 20p, and I also had the convenience of driving right past this store twice last night, so it was absolutely free in terms of fuel costs, as I was passing anyway.  The other supermarkets would have wiped out any savings I could have made on the purchases with the extra fuel it would have taken to get to them.We haven't bought any cheese this month as we are still eating the blocks we bought from Rosspa before Christmas.  I was disappointed to hear of the closing down of the Rosspa website, although I understand that the Farm shop from which it operated is still trading.  They provided good quality products at reasonable prices, so it is a shame.  Approved Foods continues to flourish, I believe, although I know that Big Brands For Less has ceased to trade and their website now redirects to Approved Foods.I'm off to Pinterest now to find a bread recipe I pinned ages ago, as I want to make some bread to go with the Leek & Potato soup I have just made for supper.News this morning from the chap who has been helping with the laptop issues - he has put it on eBay and had an offer on it!  Whosoever buys a laptop carcass with no hard drive and no working power, I don't know, but after expenses [for the chap rebuilding the hard drive into an external hard drive for us to use, and the eBay fees], we will get £30+ back!  This month is being extremely tight and I was beginning to be concerned about failing in my target to save £750 a month with the extra costs I have had this month - like the £292 car insurance payment - and I sat down yesterday and worked out the remaining commitments to pay this month, against the remaining income, and it didn't look nice - we had about £40 left over to do food and petrol with if we were still to achieve the savings [do-able but challenging, as the FH's car hasn't had any petrol since before Christmas and Needs some!].  The promise of this little boost means that we have a little more wiggle room, although I don't anticipate spending all of it, don't worry!So, we will achieve our target of £750 by the end of the month but we won't manage any more than that this month, which is a little disappointing, but I have to be thankful on two counts - one, that we have the income to make this saving possible at all, as I know a lot of people don't, and two, that it has been possible to save even that amount, and still pay the car insurance bill!On the subject of insurance, I always pay the full amount at the time of renewal as so many companies charge you extra for the convenience of paying monthly, so we try to make sure we can pay the whole amount. to avoid credit charges."},

{"title": "Mid month financial round up", "date": "Wednesday 16 January 2013", "text": "(image from dhs.state.mn.us)Middle of the month and time to round up the money again and see where we are with the targets!The first positive point is that I have already added £305 to the savings pot, so that is about 40% of the total for the month achieved.  More will be heading in that direction as it becomes available.Going through my spreadsheet, I can see the following:I have only spent less than half of the allocated money on the chook food - the supplier I get it from is on holiday and I had to get slightly more in December, so I have another order to go in at the end of the month when she comes home, but I still have a good stock and should keep this within budget.No spending on cat food necessary this month as we have a good supply of dry food from Lidl's which will keep us going for at least another 6-8 weeks.Spending on food, as already reported, has been above what I aimed for it to be specifically in January, but still well within the annual monthly budget.  This will be fine, and I will try to make significant savings in this area for the rest of the month.Activities - only one piano lesson so far this month, but a theory exam to be paid for this month that will happen next month.  I didn't know that that was coming as the piano teacher just told me last Thursday, so that is about £20-£25 to pay out [will find out exact amount tomorrow] but there is enough in that \"pot\" to cover it.Only 19p spent on medications this month so far - for one pack of supermarket paracetamol.The OH's lunch club has yet to meet this month because of the extended Christmas break that they took and this week's meeting being cancelled because of the weather, but he is going to take the chaps out to a local cafe today for lunch so I am anticipating a spend there of about £6 or so, but sometimes the other chaps pay for this lunch because he is taking them out in the car and they contribute to the petrol expenses in that way, so there isn't always a cost when he goes out to lunch.The household/cleaning budget is slightly overspent already this month but the loo roll mountain accounts for that, and the lack of need to spend in that area for some months will consequently bring that back into line.There has been some \"miscellaneous\" spending, including school trousers for the YFG, the second load of logs, a couple of packets of seeds, and a cast iron casserole.  None of these have broken the bank, and they were all necessary!  The cast iron casserole replaced a Le Creuset £50-in-2000 pot I was given as a housewarming gift back then, and I had been constantly looking for a new one since that was was burned to death last year.  I have stock pots, and I have casserole dishes for putting in the oven, but I was lacking the ability to start something off on the hob and then bung it in the oven, and I really missed that, since I have a couple of favourite recipes which do that, and I was fed up of mucking up a saute pan and a casserole dish!  So I found a non-branded £19.50 reduced from quite a lot more pot in Tesco, and I bought it.  It is in a fetching shade of grey which matches nothing, but it is what I needed to make those recipes, and I am so pleased to have got it.  It also means I can have a go at a bread recipe I have seen on Pinterest which makes a free form loaf baked in one in the oven.  A new Le Creuset version was going to be over £80, so I have made a satisfactory choice.That was the good news.  Now the less positive:The grill has completely died.  The OH is muttering about a new cooker, I am shooting for a new element in the grill.  He has a point because the main oven has a tendency to run very hot and burn things on one side, and it may be a false economy to replace the grill and then have to replace the rest later in the year.....we have been talking about a new cooker for a year or so.  I may encourage him to talk for a while longer and manage without the grill...My laptop is at the computer man's house up the road.  I am waiting to hear whether it is repairable or terminal........this is the laptop which the YFG uses for homework and to watch DVDs, which may seem low-priority but in a multi-generational household, it has a significant impact on peace-keeping!  I am keeping everything crossed that it can be repaired.I still have to pay the tax (£100) and insurance on the Skoda this month.I had a letter yesterday to say that my online ISA interest rate is dropping from 2.75% to 1% because the extra was an introductory bonus.  I have looked and can find a new ISA with the same provider which comes in at 2.20%, which whilst not great, is the best I can do without locking the money away for 2 years, which would still only garner 2.30%, and is hardly worth losing the comfort of having access to the money.  I have to organise getting to the branch and managing the transfer before the end of the month when the rate changes.A warm welcome to new followers and visitors - thank you for kind comments, and it is lovely to have you visiting!"},

 On Wednesday afternoon, it was cold and I lit the fire so that I could do my work at the table without developing icicles, and then I got suddenly so tired that I couldn't read straight so I had a nap in the chair by the fire - a whole hour!  This afternoon, the YFG must have thought I looked sleepy when I was sitting again near the fire, just having had a cup of tea on our return from gym, so she covered me up, took off my shoes, and told me to have a sleep - so I did!The busy-ness of the week since Wednesday has been reflected in the lack of blogging here - I haven't had time to think about my posts, let alone actually type them out.  I spent Thursday out and about until 6pm, and then the evening was spent typing the F&W Unit assessment up so that I could email it to the tutor.  The FH spent the day in bed with his gouty ankle, so there was a certain amount of nursemaiding to do there as well!Yesterday was the Knit & Natter at church, come home to make the tea, have a sit down and a chat, then go out to gym, and come home at 8pm to eat the said tea, and then have a bath and relax.  Fridays are always a bit hectic.  Today has been gym again, some errands in town and then the second snooze of the week.  I have just cooked the tea and have a sponge in the oven for church in the morning, so I thought I would take the opportunity to say Hello here whilst it is cooking.I've been thinking about \"saving\" and how people think of what the word means.  Seems to me that there are several different concepts in particular when we think of saving money.I have been buying this this week:  (image from loorolls.com)I have bought ten packs of it, because it is on offer at the supermarkets at the moment.  I had been buying it at AF when I had a delivery and wanted to make up the weight of a parcel, and it cost £2.60 there, which for 9 recycled rolls, is good value.  But AF seem to have run out, and other loo roll available locally is more expensive, and I do prefer the recycled stuff.  The Co-op are selling it at £2.55 and Tesco at £2.50.  Tesco claims that it is half the RRP, but I wouldn't buy it at £5 a pack - I'd look for something cheaper.  It is going down the pan, after all!  So I have spent £25 of my \"household\" section of my budget on a good few month's worth of loo roll.  I haven't \"saved\" £25 because I wouldn't have bought it at £50 for the 10 packs.  I may have saved £1 + delivery on the AF price, but they haven't got it available, so I might have saved more than that, given that I would have had to have bought another brand.  It is really hard to quantify exactly how much I have saved, but one thing is clear - I haven't got to look for loo roll bargains for several months!To me, money \"saved\" most clearly is money in the bank, safely put away for whatever reason we are saving.  Claims on advertisements and websites like MSE about \"Saving £1000 in a day\" seem unrealistic to me, because the measures that they recommend would likely not result in £1000 being added to my bank account that day.  We are all looking for best value these days, I hope - and I imagine that if you come here to read my ramblings often, you probably are.  I know that there are people out there who cannot imagine dropping a brand at the supermarket, who are trying to bring up children on the lowest levels of income and still insist that only Walkers' crisps will do, for example.Our \"low-spend\" January is progressing and we are almost at the middle of the month.  I have spent more than I would like on the groceries, and part of that is the difference in the meals that we are eating this year, compared to this time last year, and the even higher use of fruit and veg, but it is also down to the overall increases in prices, I am sure.  I do have last year's receipts somewhere, but lack the energy to find them tonight!  Cutting back drastically on the grocery budget for the year is the overall goal, as we overspend in the category every year, although I believe I set it at a reasonable level.  This year I am more determined to get this area under control.  Some areas are doing well - no books [I keep deleting emails from The Book People], magazines, stationery, toiletries [other than feminine essentials] have been required, for example, and we are staying away from the shops in general as much as possible.  Now we have our 2013 loo roll mountain, we won't need to buy any more of that for a while, either!

Tomorrow is going to be busy - a school meeting at 8.30am which could go on until lunchtime, then the chapel afternoon group from 1pm, from where I have to leave to pick up the girls for piano and then take the EFG to the optician whilst the YFG is having her lesson.  We expect to land back here about 5.45pm tomorrow night.  I have made a couple of banana cakes and a sponge for the chapel club tomorrow, just got to pop some jam in the sponge in the morning....I have been distracted this week, so I apologise - I am desperately trying to get a unit of work finished for the preaching course and off to the tutor.  I had to write what amounted to two essays on how sacrifice and the psalms have evolved in worship from OT times, through NT times, and assess how they influence worship today.  With no indication of a word count, I may have gone overboard, but there seemed to be so much to say!  I have written it all out and hope to type it ready to email tomorrow evening.  Then I can concentrate on life until Monday, when I start the next unit.  I am enjoying it, really!"},

{"title": "Gardening recommendations", "date": "Monday 7 January 2013", "text": "(image from gardenersworld.com)I spent some time on Sunday looking through my packets of seeds - the weather has been so mild lately that thoughts are turning to Spring already.  It is far from Spring here, though, so I am limiting myself to planning really at this stage - the weather forecaster dared mention snow in Countryfile last night, so winter may yet arrive with a vengeance!I have plenty of all the favourites, like dwarf French beans, runner beans, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, beetroot, spring onion, etc but I did identify some gaps.  I have no seeds for growing chilli plants [need chillies for sweet chilli jam], nor for courgettes and I thought that we would try some mangetout this year as the EFG has developed a taste for it.I have two favourite sources for seeds, and I wanted to share them, and recommend them to you, if you are in the UK.Premier Seeds Direct is an eBay seller, and I have had seeds from them for several years now.  Their service is smart and their prices are very keen!  I have just bought a pack of 150 mild chilli seeds for 99p, 25 Italian courgette seeds for 99p, and 300 mangetout seeds for 99p, and the combined postage was just 57p.  The seeds will arrive packed in a Jiffy bag, each pack of seeds in clear plastic resealable bags.  So I have to confess to a spend of £3.54 on the garden, but I think that is reasonable.  I had to get the chilli seeds ordered because I want to get them going quite soon.I also like Real Seeds, which is a members' club [you pay one penny when you place your first order each year] because they sell heirloom seeds which may not be on the official list of seeds.  Something to do with breeding and hybrids and stuff like that.  Suffice to say that they sell some very interesting stuff, and when you want something different, or a heritage/heirloom [ie not F1 hybrids], this is the place to go.  Service is a little slower as they are in deepest Wales and only post things out a couple of times a week, but they are well worth waiting for, and I would recommend them as well."},

{"title": "Saturday wanderings", "date": "Saturday 5 January 2013", "text": "(image from cambridgeandelytours.com)This is Ely Cathedral, known as the \"Ship of the Fens\" and we had a fair drive across the Fens to get there this afternoon, but the view across the fields in the bright afternoon sunshine was well worth it when we saw this!  I love the cathedral, and would go there more often if I lived closer, and, to be honest, if I could get there without the girls.  I would just sit in the cathedral and soak it up, but they want to walk around and don't appreciate the peace and tranquility of just sitting and being in God's house like that.Anyway, today is really the last day of the girls' holiday on which we could \"do\" something, because tomorrow will be occupied with chapel, and then finishing up homework and getting school stuff ready.  The EFG has been working hard for her AS level exams next week, and I thought she deserved an afternoon off.  They each had a little money from Christmas which they had had left after putting the required half in the bank, and were interested to mooch around and see what was what.  I did steer them towards the charity shops.The Saturday afternoon shoppers were out in hordes, and it was busy in the market place where there was a craft-type market going on.  We had a look, but there was nothing there we needed...After that, we hit the shops.  We found that the previously \"little\" independent bookshop, Topping & Co, has extended itself since our last visit, and now covers three whole floors of wonderful books to explore.  There are nooks and crannies, rooms off other rooms, coffee and reading chairs.   It is extremely comfortable, and we all enjoyed spending nearly half an hour browsing the shelves.  They each bought a book, and the EFG chose particularly well - a signed copy of \"The Woman in Black\" by Susan Hill.Apart from that, we just had a good look around, and eventually got home to cook the tea at around 5.30pm after a peaceful ride home.  It was good to spend the afternoon together, get some fresh air and exercise and visit a little city we all love into the bargain.  Tonight we have had Sticky Chicken, with veg and rice, and now the FH has gone to bed, the EFG is working, the YFG is reading to me, and I am typing this.  The fire is lit, and I think that she and I will be moving to the sitting room shortly so that I can knit by the fire whilst she reads.I am really looking forward to Monday, and it is not because the girls are going back to school!It is because I have had no washing machine since the Thursday before Christmas, and an engineer is finally coming to fix it on Monday!(image from telegraph.co.uk)It made its death rattling noise on the Thursday evening, so first thing Friday morning, I was on the phone to the helpline because it was still within its first year guarantee.  I was lucky to get an engineer out to look at it on Christmas Eve, the first Monday, but he wiggled the drum, sighed, and said, \"Your drum's gone - I'll have to order you a new one.\"  And my heart sank!  He told me that someone would ring me this week just gone to arrange an appointment to get the new drum fitted, which they did, on Monday [NYEve, the second Monday].  A lady told me that the chap would come on Monday the 7th, to which I am afraid I wailed, \"Not before then?\" but she assured me that that was the earliest she could do.I am just counting my blessings now, I suppose.  I have kind friends in the village who have allowed me the use of their machines whilst mine is out of action, and I am lucky that it \"died\" within the first year's guarantee, albeit only by just over 10 days!  A couple of people have said that it would be cheaper to buy a new one, but if I can get this one fixed for free, of course I would do that.  If I had had to pay for this repair, perhaps I would have gone down that route - but washing machines are getting so cheap these days, that one wonders how long they are actually designed to last.  Roll on Monday - the washing is waiting again!!"},
{"title": "A learning curve again", "date": "Friday 4 January 2013", "text": "Today we went to the shops for the first time this year, and in this budget period.  It was difficult!  Being honest here, friends!  I overspent the £20 I had planned to budget for the week.....To be a little fairer on myself, I did buy some things which will not all get eaten this week.  I bought a lot of fruit and veg [green beans, and frozen green beans, grapes, carrots, mangetout, broccoli, and clementines], some dairy products [cheese and Frubes], bread, ham, beef mince, and some reduced-price crisps.  That all came to £30.97. We did, however, buy 4 packs of Frubes at £1 each, with 9 in each packet.  The YFG freezes these and then has them in her lunchbox several times a week.  The four boxes represent about 7 weeks of school, and will actually last longer as she probably wouldn't have one every day.  Because we freeze them, we can keep them long past the date on the pack.The crisps are also destined for the YFG's lunchboxes over a period of time.  They are big bags, and were reduced from over a £1 to 30p each - I think one would last her quite a few days, and she can close the big bag up with a klippit.  Once they are gone, though, they probably won't be replaced as I don't often buy crisps.It would be possible to consider that green beans and mangetout are expensive veg to be buying at this time of year, and that we perhaps would do better to eat cheaper veg.  I completely agree, but when the EFG is struggling with her weight loss plan, and those are the veg she prefers, I feel that it is better to have her eat the veg she likes than none at all.  She will also eat broccoli, cabbage, carrots, etc but life gets very boring if that is all you eat!  I bought frozen beans as well as fresh, so that we can try those and see if they are OK; I suspect that they will be fine and we will just buy those in future.I definitely didn't buy any cake of any kind!  The YFG did ask for a doughnut [the joys of shopping with children along!] but I said, \"No.\"  She accepted that, and didn't whinge.  I hope she was remembering that there are Tunnocks teacakes, lemon cakes and chocolate cakes in the cupboard from the last Rosspa order, as well as a tin of Rose's chocolates left from Christmas, and the Christmas cake too.  We are not short of sweet things.  I also have plenty of margerine, flour, sugar and eggs in the house, so I could soon make some when we feel a need.The YFG found a Betty Crocker shakeable just-add-water pancake mix in the shop, selling for £1 which makes just 6 pancakes.  That resonated with her as one of our friends said only yesterday that she couldn't make pancakes.  The YFG read the ingredients list on the back and wasn't that impressed.  She can make her own - it only interested her because she wondered how people live without being able to make their own pancakes as they are one of her treats.I am going to have to get back into the groove of breadmaking again this year.  I have the breadmakers, the slicing machine, the freezer to store the bread, and even the flour and yeast.  No excuses, really.  I spent over £3 today on three loaves of bread - and they were in the reduced section!  That is an area in which I can definitely make a difference.  I hope that I can find a good recipe to use this year - I think that there was one at The Quince Tree so I will see if it is still there.The beef mince found its way into an Enchilada packet mix which was lurking in the cupboard.  This was shared between the three of them for a Friday night treat, although I quickly and surreptitiously put the spare portion into a plastic tub and it is heading for the freezer - no one needed another helping, and it will be there for another Friday night treat for someone.  I think portion control is going to be important in the challenges this year, and it is something I will be working on in other areas as well as the kitchen....That was my first day.  Not too bad, overall, as although I overspent, it is not beyond redeeming, and I think that I reminded myself of some valuable ideas, as well as picking up some from other places.  A learning curve indeed.And tonight?  I am going to spend the next 45 minutes or so constructing my spreadsheets for this year's record keeping - what fun!  I want to be ready for Monday and my financial record keeping day."},
{"title": "January challenge", "date": "Thursday 3 January 2013", "text": "(image from holidays.mrdonn.org)I have thought of enough health/wealth challenges to do for the first six months of the year, so we are ready to begin with the January one.  Me being me, and having done this one several times before, it should come as  no surprise to hear that we are going to have a \"Low-Spend Month\".Bills will be paid, essentials will be bought, and we won't go overdue with our Council Tax payments.  Commitments will be honoured - like the second load of logs I have already ordered, the YFG's piano lessons, and the FH's lunch club.  It is rather in discretionary purchases that we will be more careful and much more considered.There will be no spending on books, magazines, toys, clothes, games, etc, household appliances or decorations, or fancy goods.  I will not add to my fabric or wool stash, I will not go to the cinema, nor will I do anything which involves spending money if I can at all help it!  Please don't think that we are going to suffer - we aren't.  What we are going to do is become, for this month at least, a lot more disciplined.The thing is, we have lots of stuff in stock here already.  I have wool to knit with, books to read, paper to write on and pens to write with!  We have DVDs and the tv to watch, we have jigsaws to do, and I have plenty of work to do to occupy myself without any need to spend a penny!  I have toiletries stashed away, three freezers and my stock cupboards full of food.  We all have shoes aplenty, warm coats, scarves and gloves.  I don't think that there is anything we NEED!I think that most of our grocery spending will be on fresh fruit and veg, as it was last time we did this challenge.  I know that there are odd items, like mint sauce, that we have run out of, but if I keep lamb off the menu for the month, I won't look for it.  I'd like to keep our grocery budget for the month to £100, or roughly £20 a week, since this is almost a 5-week month.  I'll be thinking of it as 5 back-to-back $21 challenges.  I know it is going to get interesting in the kitchen, but that is half the fun!As well as the projected £750 that the budget aims to put into savings this month, I would hope to add at least £250 to that.  I will keep track through the month and let you know how we are getting on!"},
{"title": "Moving forward in 2013", "date": "Wednesday 2 January 2013", "text": "Ready at last to unveil my plans for this year!  It has taken me time to think and prepare, and to decide how to do this all again this year.  Things are going to be a little different, and I actually know I can do better than I did in 2012, because I am more aware now of all the ways I wasted money in 2012. So, to start with, where are we now?  I am not going to disclose actual net worth and figures, but it should be enough to know that I saved the £5001 last year, and so we are definitely £5001 better off in terms of money in the bank than we were at this time last year.  In addition to that, we also bought two cars at a cost of £2995 or so, and had a week's holiday in June (£790 for accommodation although the sealed pot paid for most of the other expenses) , and a shorter break in Norfolk in October (£135 for accommodation and approx £150 otherwise).  We bought the EFG's travel card at £450.  Those are the major spends in 2012.The bulk of the money saved this year [£4550] has been safely stashed in my online ISA and is working hard at earning me some interest!I know that I am exceptionally lucky in our circumstances right now, in that we have no mortgage and no rent to pay, that we live in a 4 bedroom house with enough garden ground to allow me to do my chicken breeding, grow veggies, make things [the FH in his workshop] for the house and garden ourselves, store vast amounts of reclaimed wood for the fire, and space to stockpile or store food/supplies and generally live what others regard to be an \"old-fashioned\" type of lifestyle [I know they think that because they have told me!].I am thankful that the work I do with the chickens and the gymnastics coaching at the school allows me enough space to give plenty of my time and energy to voluntary work at the school, the town gym club, and the church.  I am grateful for my family's understanding that these are things I feel a need to do.I know that life will change for us drastically when the FH is no longer here, and this drives me now to provide a cushion for the future.  My lifestyle will change through necessity, and the girls may no longer be with me, because I hope that this will not happen for many years, so they may be away from home at university, they may have homes and families of their own.  It seems very foolish not to see this coming and to do what I can to be ready, at least in some small way.  There needs to be enough for me to have some time to think, to prepare, to accept the changes, and to make new arrangements for the future.  I am working  towards a fund which holds enough to support the three of us for a year.  I don't want to look to anyone else to support us in the midst of what will be turmoil for us.  At that time, I don't want to have to sell the home the girls have had the longest.I am already working, and have been for some time, towards a career move for myself, but it isn't something I can do overnight, and I can't do it at all at present.  I'm being quite philosophical tonight!  I think that we are bringing up our children with a good attitude towards money and the earning/spending of it.  They don't have the latest everything, they accept that things cannot be bought the moment the desire for them is recognised, they are used to thinking about how spending money will impact on other areas of their lives.  They are not always as appreciative as I would like them to be, but they can't be perfect, and I wouldn't want anyone to think that they are!  The EFG was shocked,though,  to hear before Christmas that one of her friends \"owes\" her mother over £200 and couldn't understand how that could happen.  Apparently the mother and daughter go shopping recreationally together, and when the daughter sees something she likes but expresses her disappointment that she can't afford it, the mother encourages her to buy it and loans her the money.  This seems very sad to me, and a bad example to be setting a child, especially when the mother seems to be letting the daughter's spending get out of control.The aim for 2013 [before you all fall asleep!]I want to have between £7500 and £9000 further in the bank by the end of the year.  This will represent a significant proportion of our income for the year [more than 30%] and may be subject to change if our income changes.How are we going to achieve this?Setting and monitoring a strict budget for the yearRecording every penny spent, on what and wherePaying the savings account firstMaking the most of all loyalty schemes Continuing with Shop & Scan to accumulate vouchers A monthly Challenge for health and/or wealth!

 That applies to cooking, crafts, baking, preserving, growing, repairing, bartering, etc.Meter monitoring, and trying to reduce wastage of electricity/oil/gas/water etc.Re-starting my use of home made laundry detergent, and making more use of natural/simple house cleaning products.Earning whatever I can through selling things on Amazon/eBay etc, as well as doing whatever paid coaching I can, and breeding some chooks this year.  Continuing with the girls' allowance scheme which makes them more accountable for their spending choices.I will also continue to spend time at MSE and Frugaldom's forums, learning from all you wonderful people.  I also enjoy reading a multitude of supportive and encouraging blogs, because I find that in real life, people don't particularly understand such a strong drive to save money, and my online friends are much more accommodating and supportive - so here's to another year of frugal fun!"},

This afternoon, I have spent some more time making plans, reading, knitting, and having a snooze as well.  The fire has been lit and we all sat around and enjoyed each other's company whilst doing our own thing.  This evening, I have spent time watching \"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\" with the girls, although I think that the YFG may have spent more time on Tumblr than actually watching the film!And resolutions?  No, not as such.  Plans, yes.  But they are for tomorrow as tonight I have an appointment with a Lee Child novel and I am off to read for a while before I go to sleep."},

 I have lost weight and feel fitter than I have done for a long time, and the girls are growing in their independence and confidence.  I have knitted a scarf  competently!  I have already blogged my savings success today, too.  Talking of blogging, I am delighted that more of you are actually \"following\" now and the daily visitor count seems to be rising month on month - so I am humbled and touched by your interest in my wafflings.Happy New Year to you and yours, from all the Fen Family xx(image from keepers.info)This has been an expensive month, which isn't unexpected, given that it has been Christmas, but the expenses have reflected other things beyond the festive celebrations.The chicken food bill was nearly doubled as I had to order enough to see them through to the middle of January.  The grocery figure is quite high as we have had guests for the holidays on quite a few days and have had some different foods which we have enjoyed over the season, but which we don't have all the time.My particular/special food budget has been stretched whilst I made the most of a special offer on some seed bars, which were on offer for a limited time.  The household pot has been stretched by buying a four year supply of washing machine cleaner in an attempt to minimise damage to the machinery by our hard water in this area.  The \"other\" bit of my budget has also had a dent in it, due to me finally getting round to acquiring some photo frames for some photos of the YFG at her recent gym competitions [she is now up on the wall and looking splendid, so money well spent], posting parcels to friends and relatives at Christmas, paying for the ROSSPA delivery, and having a bulb replaced in my car by Halfords.We invested in the logs from my friend's son...On a more positive note, though:I used less than one third of the fuel [diesel/petrol] budget.The \"activities\" pot was hardly dented as there were no payments to make, and piano finished early.We are doing well health-wise and little has been spent on medications.I have discovered that Tesco's ink is OK in the printer, and so I can buy their cartridges at £9 instead of full-price HP versions.Most significantly, I have been entering our electricity meter readings every Monday for a couple of months, and when I went to the website today to enter today's reading, I was delighted to find a message from Scottish Power, saying that our DD will be reduced to £56 a month, leaving an extra £20 a month in our pockets.  Given that at the beginning of the year, we were paying £114 a month to Utility Warehouse, I am thrilled to have halved our electricity bill this year!  We don't seem to be using significantly less, but I think Scottish Power have more reasonable rates.My 2013 household management folder is all ready for the year to begin tomorrow, and I am hoping to do as well as I have done this year, and maybe even better!  I know that there are areas of spending on which I could improve, but there are things we all do which are peculiar to us and make life worth living.  We each need to decide on our own priorities.  (image from www.guardian.co.uk)The last day of the year is upon us, and it falls as a Monday, which fits in perfectly with my taking stock and recording day.I have checked all the bank accounts this morning, the savings and the current account, and moved some money around to make the best of it.I haven't ventured outside to read the electricity meter yet as it is still dark, but I am guessing that our usage will be down this week without having had a washing machine...still waiting for the drum to be replaced - thank goodness for friends in the village!  As that is the only difference, it will be interesting to see roughly how much the washing costs us each week.Anyway, there is no money coming in today, and it is the last day of the year, so I can reveal that I HAVE achieved my savings target of £5000 for the year!  I have saved £5001.70.  To say that I am pleased would be an understatement - I am totally thrilled that this has happened.  It has come through hard work, thrift, decent money management, and household management, and some good interest payments too!  I am still finalising the plans for 2013, but I guess that it would be safe to say that I plan to do it all again in 2013."},

The chocolate chunks oozed a little but that added to the flavour a lot, so a little oozing can be forgiven.It was a case of using what I had in stock, and what I thought would be appreciated here.  I haven't got any cranberries to make Elaine's version, and I hadn't any pistachios to make Martha's either.  There is another recipe I would like to try another time, for Christmas Biscotti which an MSE poster has shared and they have mincemeat in them.  Got plenty of that, so they may be next on the \"challenge-myself\" list!"},

{"title": "Baby Cambridge", "date": "Monday 3 December 2012", "text": "(image from bbc.co.uk)The news has reached us this afternoon that the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge are expecting a baby.  The Duchess has been taken in to hospital today suffering from acute morning sickness.I am delighted to hear that they are having a baby, but she has my sympathies for the morning sickness, and for being in the early stages of pregnancy over the Christmas period.  The two Christmases which I spent in that condition, having conceived in November both times, were the most miserable I remember!  In fact, in the first one, Christmas Day was the day I threw up the most times........And when you want to be relaxing and enjoying spending time with the family, it is hard going when you feel so rough.The BBC News tonight is full of speculation over the due date, the succession, and the health of Catherine, since she is ill enough to have been admitted to hospital.  She seems to be in the best place, so I shall just add her to my prayer list, and hope she feels better soon.  Hopefully, she will be blooming before too long.Mondays for me are about keeping on track.  I tot up the figures in the budgets and look at the finances, I read the electric meter and see how much we have used this week (£12.60's worth this time) and I do some housework and washing.  I look in the freezers and the fridges and consider a meal plan for the week, and I always write myself some kind of weekly plan, so that I don't forget to do anything.I'm also doing my Faith & Worship course work on Mondays, so I had better turn off this computer and get on with it all. See you all later xx"},
{"title": "My thoughts on Advent Sunday", "date": "Sunday 2 December 2012", "text": "(image from southbear.com)Today is Advent Sunday and we will light the first candles in our Advent wreaths at the chapels in the circuit here this week.  We have a special liturgy which we will use over the weeks, which brings us closer and closer to Christmas.I am taking the service in a nearby chapel this morning, the second time I have been there, and the crowd are lovely, so I am looking forward to seeing them all again.Not surprisingly, I am going to be talking with them about the theme of \"waiting\".  \"Waiting\" can be such a passive thought - think of the connotations of the word - waiting rooms [waiting for appointments, or trains to come along], playing the waiting game [waiting for someone's decision or an outcome of something] or even those royal ladies-in-waiting [who wait upon someone else's needs].  It is all very passive.We are called to be active in our wait for Christ's return, though; we can't sit patiently and wait - there is work to be done on earth, a message to be told, and the gospel to be spread, so that when the train comes into the station bearing Christ, that station is absolutely packed out with people waiting to see him and get on the train with him!I will also be sharing the thought that no one mentions God's waiting in all of this very often.  God has waited generations for all his people to turn to Him, and is still waiting patiently and faithfully for us.  As I said a few weeks ago, my great grandfather was preaching the gospel three generations ago, and the message is the same for me now as I begin my own preaching journey - God loves us, and He wants us to open our Hearts and our Lives to Him."},

{"title": "St Andrew", "date": "Friday 30 November 2012", "text": "Today is St Andrew's Day, patron saint of Scotland, and a host of other countries too.(image from visit-scotland.com)The girls were both born in Scotland, so I did tell them this morning that it was \"their\" saints' day, but neither were terribly interested.....I thought it was a shame, but perhaps when they were rushing around getting ready to go to school wasn't the best time to tell them!(image from wikipedia.com)The West Port in St Andrews, Fife, where I attended the university, years before Prince William!(image from st-andrews.ac.uk)And this is the entrance to St Mary's College Quadrangle, where the Divinity school is situated.  It is a lovely area to work, in very old and historic buildings.  There is a room in the library complex in this college where I used to study each day - and the Scottish Parliament used to sit there.  It is called Parliament Hall, surprisingly enough!St Andrew has a whole page on Wikipedia, so you can pop over there to read more about him.Happy St Andrew's Day!(image from en.wikipedia.org)I still have to find £699.84 for the savings challenge I set myself this year, and now I have just one month to do it.  I am fairly confident that I can do this, knowing roughly what money I have coming in, and what expenses I have to cover this month.  It is still do-able....at least I am thinking positively.  I have done some of the things on the plan to achieve that figure, and some of them are being more successful than others.The spending in November went a little haywire.  It wasn't helped by odd things like the optician's appointment I made because I am convinced that my eyesight has deteriorated.  The optician agreed with me, charging me £27.50 to tell me that although he agrees, he thinks that because I have had a cold, the likelihood is that a virus has affected the muscles in my eyes, and he would rather re-test after Christmas than  have new glasses now.  Mmmm - that sounds like risking another £27.50 to be told that I am OK, perhaps. I'll see how they go over the holidays and into January before I rush into another appointment.The house insurance, although a lot cheaper than last year, also had to be paid in November, and I have bought some things in for Christmas.  It is likely that I have actually done the bulk of the spending in November and that December won't be that bad.  I have had an AF delivery, I have stocked up on shower gels from Boots, and now also on shampoo and bubble bath since Tesco had offers on both today, and the house is pretty well stocked up again.The Winter Fuel Payment came in for the FH this week, so we are likely to order some oil soon.  The tank is half full, so I am keeping my eye on the prices.  We need oil, but we are far from desperate, so no need to pay ridiculous prices for express deliveries.  We also have heaps of wood in the workshop, so the house is pretty cosy - not hot - but with the fire, hot water bottles, cosy rugs and hot drinks, we are all staying warm in these cold evenings.I am also \"banking\" rewards which I may not use until after Christmas - I have £24 in yougov which will not pay out until it reaches £50, so still some way to go with that one.  Shop-and-Scan has so far paid me £19 which I can convert into vouchers when it gets to £20, and I already have a £10 Amazon voucher sitting here, waiting to be used.  The Shop-and-Scan will probably become Amazon vouchers as well, and then I will have £30 to spend.  I am hoping to get some more books for the Faith & Worship course which would be useful as I already have my eye on a little prayer book that I have seen a copy of and have been hoping to get one of my own.I am reading the electricity meter weekly and submitting the reading to Scottish Power online each time, which is helping me to keep track more accurately of how much power we are using.  I know that we are \"high users\" but they have us on a DD which amounts to £19 a week, whereas we are currently [sorry!] using about £14 a week.  I will track it for a little longer and then I might try to ask for the DD to be reconsidered.I am waiting for some parcels to arrive from BzzAgent.  We did the Dove shampoo and conditioner campaign and now we have been asked to review some other products - a Knorr gravy or stock pot, and J20 fridge packs of juice.  The girls are looking forward to the juice, and the FH to the gravy.  I doubt I will personally be able to use either....."},

{"title": "Anniversary ", "date": "Tuesday 27 November 2012", "text": "(image from en.wikipedia.org)Today has been our 16th wedding anniversary, which we have commemorated in our usual style, by doing nothing different whatsoever!!  We don't do a lot about anniversaries, to be honest, and we usually remember the day afterwards, but today, I remembered in time to comment this morning that today was the day!  Wikipedia suggests that the traditional gift for this year would be something made of porcelain.  Best not, here, as porcelain wouldn't last five minutes....I don't feel hard done by in any way, because, actually, we didn't make that big a deal over the wedding: we had a registry office do with some friends and neighbours [no family made the journey], and then went home to a shared lunch which I prepared, and a cake which I had made and a lady in the street had iced for me.  We had a snooze in the afternoon with the baby, the EFG, who was 12 weeks old, and then some more friends came round in the evening for a chat and a drink and a few nibbles.  And more cake!  My outfit came from the Save the Children shop in St Andrews, and cost £10 for the two piece.  I wore some shoes I already had, and the FH wore his suit.  The rings came from a jewellers in St Andrews as well, and whilst the engagement ring was new, the wedding ring was second hand.  It is a lovely ring, though.I feel that it isn't the wedding that needs the time and the effort, but the marriage, and we have certainly done that.  We have been through a lot - lots of medical upheavals, house moves, two children, family woes, financial cramp [as the FH calls it] and still we can say we love each other and are happy to be together.  That, to us, is worth everything.I sat knitting last night for a while, and I was thinking about the scarf I am knitting [whole other post there - must take a photo of it] which I think may be a test run.  I want to use the pattern for some little boys' scarves for the Christmas boxes next year as we were very short of knitted items for little boys.  It would have to be a little narrower than the pattern though, and I don't know how to alter the pattern - waiting for expertise from other knitters on that one.I have spent £4.40 on two balls of lovely wool to make this scarf, which although not cheap, is not an exorbitant sum.  It is going to take me many hours of knitting to make each one, though, so my time will be a greater donation than my money in this case.I do help to sponsor a child through the ShareNiger project [see button in sidebar] but that is the only thing I do which is pure money.  I feel quite put out sometimes when I see the continuous advertisements in newspapers and on tv which urge us to donate \"£3 a month\" or some other small amount, to their cause.  Surely they realise that these small amounts add up, and we can't all be donating £36 a year to all the causes.  I certainly can't. (image from macmillan.org.uk)The annual Macmillan fundraising which I lead in the chapel, the work I do for the chapel itself, the Christmas boxes, work at the gym and the school, and small financial donations to good causes I support when I can - that is what I do.  It is all I can do, because we don't have the financial resources to just give cash, so I have to make the money go further by injecting it with my time, so to speak, to make more of it.  I do feel bad sometimes when I walk past someone with a collecting tin and don't stop to put anything in, but I think I have to get past this feeling of guilt, and worrying what they will think of me, and just come home and knit another few rows of a scarf and remember that we all do what we can, and we can do no more than that."},
{"title": "A weird kind of day", "date": "Monday 26 November 2012", "text": "Not in a bad way, but today has been a bit different!I pottered around doing housework after the girls went off to school at 8am, and then the chickens were next on the list.  I came in for breakfast, and then rang a friend to organise fetching a bale of straw from her field, which was set for 11am.  In between, I did several loads of laundry and did a bit of Faith & Worship reading but couldn't settle to do much.I went to get the straw and delivered the ironing back to the chapel [tablecloths!] and came home - by which time it was nearly lunchtime, so hanging some more washing and dealing with some emails filled in the time until I ate.  And then, do you know what, I had a nap!  I was reading some books from which I was hoping to draw some inspiration for the Sunday service, and I could feel my eyes getting heavy, so I curled up on the sofa and slept - for a good 90 minutes, too.The FH had gone to his friend's house, to cook him some lunch, and he didn't come home again until just after I woke up.  The F&W work did get done eventually, but not quite in the volume I had hoped.Tonight, I have spoken to my cousin and my aunt because my uncle was taken in to hospital this morning with irregular heartbeats, after collapsing.  He is in there for the night at least, and the doctors are trying different things to get his heart beating normally again.  I hope to hear more positive news from them tomorrow; this uncle has a history of heart problems, and had a heart attack some years ago.  He has just celebrated his 70th birthday this month.  I'll be praying for him and the family. Do check out our blogging friend from Cornwall who has been in the Daily Express today - congratulations, Froogs!  She is an inspiration to us all."},
{"title": "Afternoon glory", "date": "Sunday 25 November 2012", "text": "This afternoon has been absolutely glorious here in the Fens.  I drove to town with the YFG and came the scenic route home for a change.  The skies were blue, the sun was shining and we could see for miles in the crisp, clear air.  The windmill were busy twirling to make electricity, and the wind had died down a little.  It was just lovely.The chicken shed made it through the day.  I let them out this morning before chapel, and shut the door so that nothing untoward happened whilst we were out, and then I opened it up for them once we got home again.  They have had some of the AF couscous today - about 10 packets emptied into a bucket and a kettle full of hot water poured over it and left to stand.  They were very happy to have something warm and filling in their tummies before bedtime, which seems to come earlier and earlier these dark days!  I will be very glad to get past the 21st December and start the lighter evenings coming our way.In honour of Stir-up Sunday, the preacher at chapel this morning gave each family a Tesco Alcohol-free Christmas pudding [no alcohol on chapel premises] because he had thought of actually making puddings as part of the service for us to take home to cook, but had then decided that would take too long, so he bought them instead.  It was a lovely gesture, and we have plenty now: in addition to that one, I also have two I made and a small one I bought from Lidl's.I have been watching the news and seen the devastation which the flooding is causing; I am thinking of people whose homes are inundated yet again, and who must be feeling very low in all of this upheaval.  We have friends in Bridgwater in Somerset, and are keeping a close eye on their updates on Facebook so that we can see how they are faring - they are all OK at the moment.The weather here this morning is rather wild; the wind is blowing hard and I am a little concerned about the chook shed - once I open the door to let them out, the wind will be blowing directly into it, as it is coming from the west-ish, and might take the roof off....but I can't let them out and then shut the door as they will want to be in and out to get some shelter, lay their eggs, and get out of the rain, if it rains........what a pain this weather has become. But I should be counting my blessings here, instead of moaning!  We live in one of the most well-drained areas of the country, where flooding is rare to any great extent, and contained where it does usually happen.  We do expect certain places to flood each winter in this area, but they are \"washes\" which are areas of land where the floodwater is allowed to go, and it is contained within the washes by banks.  A few roads are affected, but the diversion signs go up very quickly and locals know whether the route is likely to be flooded based on the recent rainfall.(photo from en.wikipedia.org)There are areas of land where the Fen skaters used to practice each winter - the land would flood and then freeze solid in the winter, and people would go out and skate - some of the greatest Fenland speed skaters came from areas I know.  The FH went with an old friend to a cemetery on the Cambs/Norfolk border only last month, and there was a grave there of a speed skater called \"Turkey\" Smart, and he had skates on his grave!  The friend had a family connection to the area and wanted to revisit old haunts, so they went on a day out and spent some time in the area."},
{"title": "Drying dilemma", "date": "Saturday 24 November 2012", "text": "(image from Argos.co.uk)I posted some weeks ago about my frustrations with the damp November weather meaning that my washing wasn't getting dry in the verandah, because that largely relies upon sunshine to heat the area and heat the washing up!  Inside I have only two airers which the FH made, which take a load between them.So I went to Argos and spent a little money - £26 odd.  A little, compared to the lot I had slightly considered spending at Lakeland on a heated airer!!  I bought two of these airers, pictured above.They will hold about a load each, depending on what I have washed.  If it is a load of towels, or trousers, they have to share the load.  One is near a radiator in the lounge, and the other is on the landing, again near a radiator, but also at the top of the stairs, taking advantage of any rising heat from downstairs.  Now that the weather is definitely colder, we are using the central heating for about an hour in the mornings whilst we get up and moving!And are they helping?  You bet!  In conjunction with the original airers, and an over the radiator type of rail which is actually over a door where I can hang items on coathangers, we have the washing dilemma sorted out here.  Most things are dry within two days, and the washing heap isn't getting too big these days.  Bearing in mind that I am drying all this stuff indoors now, I am aware of the need to prevent condensation, and I have several windows open a crack on the first notch to allow air to circulate.  When the weather is fine and dry outside, windows are thrown open for at least 15 minutes a day to get some fresh air."},
{"title": "Christmas craft", "date": "Friday 23 November 2012", "text": "(image from lakeland.co.uk)This photo doesn't do the \"Merry Christmas\" bunting I have seen in the Lakeland catalogue justice at all.  It is quite a bit nicer than it appears in this photo, and something I think I could make a version of!  The original in the shop is £12.99, which for 14 triangular pieces of material and some letters attached to some stringy stuff seems rather expensive.  I'm not buying it, don't worry.I think that I may have enough Christmassy material [or at least red, green and white material] stashed away somewhere that I could make it.  If I make judicious use of pinking shears to reduce fraying, and quite liberal use of glue, I may even be able to get away without much sewing......I am not that great at sewing.This weekend may well find me digging out the fabric and having a look to see what else I might need.  We are lucky to have had a Boyes shop open up relatively recently in one of the nearby towns, and they have a fairly cheap haberdashery section, so I could get a few bits in there if need be.Can any of you expert seamstresses out there offer me any advice or top tips?For Lesley and anyone else interested in the hobnob type biscuit recipe - the original is here on the MSE forums.I double the amounts and it makes a good batch.  They freeze very well if you want to bake a big batch and save some for later.  If you don't freeze them, be sure to hide some or they will all be gone in a flash!"},
{"title": "Update on the day", "date": "Thursday 22 November 2012", "text": "The mince pies have turned out well, as this recipe always does, but it was late in the afternoon before I had time to make them!  I had forgotten this morning that I had to go and help to clean the chapel, so I had to go and do that first - I got home at 3pm, and had to rest for an hour as I was so tired from all that cleaning as it does involve a lot of humping furniture around to clean around it - chairs and stuff.  The lady with whom I was doing it and I were shocked and saddened to find woodworm in the altar table today, so we treated it with some goo in a bottle, and will have to keep an eye on it.Five dozen pies have been made, as well as some hobnob biscuits, and I have two Christmas puddings in the slow cooker where I am going to leave them overnight.  It is this wartime recipe from Rationing Revisited, and it smells lovely.  I didn't have any marmalade, so I used honey.My Approved Food order arrived nice and early this morning, so I was able to use some of the Mincemeat with Dark Chocolate in some of the pies so that the FH could do a taste test.  He had to eat a few to make up his mind, you understand, but he quite liked the new mincemeat.  It is by Duerr's, but I haven't seen it in the supermarkets, so it is a good job I ordered four jars....The wind is howling round the house tonight and the rain is really lashing down out there - I have been thinking about all the people affected by floods and by damage done by the winds today.  I hope everyone keeps safe and dry tonight, and I wish our American readers and friends a very happy Thanksgiving.Tomorrow is the annual Christmas Coffee Morning at the chapel, and several dozen mince pies have been requested....some will be eaten as refreshments and some will be packaged for sale.  That will be today's job, then.  I also need to dig out a few books and cards to have on a stall, in the hope that someone might want a few little presents, and I probably need to make some  kinds of cake for the refreshments too.  I am the refreshments lady at Coffee mornings, although one of the other ladies usually makes a chocolate log concoction which people rave over, so hopefully she may have time to make one of those this week.The amazing mince pie recipe is here because I shared it last year.  I will try to add in some photos later when I have made the pies. I have been reading recipe books lately and had an idea for a modification of the recipe, which is to grate some orange rind into the pastry.  It sounds like it might add another dimension to the taste.  Alas, I can't try it today as I have no oranges, but perhaps I will try it in a later batch - there will have to be more, for the Songs of Praise afternoon, and for the family here.   I still haven't spent any thing on groceries, but today might be the day!  I also know that there will be money to pay for the YFG's piano lesson, and for the new Grade 2 pieces book that the teacher gave her last week.  Once I drop her off at the lesson, I have to go to the shops for a few bits like fruit and some chilled items. I am confident that I will spend less than £20 which is the challenge for the week.  I will report back later!"},
{"title": "Spending update", "date": "Wednesday 21 November 2012", "text": "Since I posted on Monday about the Grocery challenge I am doing this week, I haven't spent anything on food yet.  In fact the only spending at all has been £1.05 on some photocopying for the church!Tonight's slow cooker meal is going to be some of the rabbit I bought in Holt whilst we were on holiday last month.  I have popped it into the slow cooker with a tin of chopped tomatoes and some garlic, and it will cook slowly until about 8pm tonight.  The aroma is already appetising!  I know that the girls probably won't want rabbit, so I have got some meatballs out of the freezer for them.  I still have enough vegetables between fresh ones and frozen to last another couple of days at least, so we are good to continue with the challenge.Slightly disappointed with my Approved Foods delivery which was ordered last week and scheduled for delivery today - I had to get in touch because there was no delivery slot on the DPD website, and apparently the package is so damaged that DPD have decided not to deliver it to me but to send it back.  AF are sending another one out today, but sans the Matthew Walker Christmas Puddings that we were looking forward to - I was going to use a couple of them for Christmas hampers for gifts and a raffle prize for the chapel on Friday.  Never mind - I shall have to change my plans a little.  I could always make a couple as I think I have everything I would need, apart from the pudding bowls...(Image from marthastewart.com)My gift wrapping is not up to Martha Stewart standards, but they say practise makes perfect, don't they!?!This week I have been finalising some gifts that I needed for various people on my list.  One young lad I know didn't know what he would like, so I asked him 20 questions last weekend and I have ordered something I know he will love, and well within my budget too!A baby boy will be getting a home made fleece blanket, using some IKEA fleeces I have left from last year; the girl that I made the fleece blanket for last year loves hers, and I think this little boy will be snug and warm in his.  His sister is a tricky one, though - what do 3 year old girls like these days?  This particular one does like books, so that may be OK.The teenage girls are under control.  Sorted!The adults - my dad and my uncle, for example - are probably going to be getting foodie items!  That is still that plan.  And all I need to do in advance for that one is sort out something to deliver them in...The teachers and TAs at the village school will get the little chocolates and mock Rochers that I tried earlier in the season, and the cellophane bags are here, and I bought some very cheap but Christmassy ribbons last weekend, so that one is also under control.The little stash of items for the girls' stockings is also developing nicely.  Nothing too extravagant, but little bits and pieces that are either beautiful or useful. The FH has a couple of items we know he loves..."},

[And I won't be cooking it...]On Saturday, I am looking forward to spending the afternoon at home now that the YFG has stopped doing ballet due to scheduling hassles with the teacher, and we have nothing on this Saturday.  I will be popping some baked potatoes into the mini oven and leaving them to it for about an hour.  They'll be served with beans, cheese, salad, tuna perhaps, whatever is lurking in that storecupboard and needs using up from the fridge!And on Sunday, I think I might have a bit of a cooking session.  I know that I have chicken breasts and mince in the freezer, so will be planning to make some portions for meals that we can just take from the freezer on nights when there isn't a lot of time.  Tea will be portions of something I make - or some of Froog's lamb faggots which have been in the freezer a couple of weeks now - there aren't many portions of those left!"},
{"title": "Mid month finance update", "date": "Monday 19 November 2012", "text": "(image from fnancialhelper.co.uk)Before I start, I just want to say two things - a warm welcome to the latest followers who have joined up, and that I am thinking of all those people who have been affected by flooding today - some people haven't got over the last floods and now here they are inundated again.  Particularly thinking of people in Perthshire because I know that area a little.  So, the mid month finance update - a bit late but better late than never.I have been a little too keen with the savings this time!  I know I told you about the £1123.45 that I want to put into savings before the end of the month...well, I thought I would get off to a flying start, and I moved £400 out of the current account into savings, and I am blowed if I am going to put a penny of it back.  That is a one-way street...but it means that I have to squeak through the next week until we get any more money paid into the bank, and I have bills to pay with what is in there.\"No problem,\" I know you will shout - \"you have all that food in the storecupboards,\" you will remind me!And I will agree.  But I do need to buy fresh fruit and veg each week.  You know I have a strange diet of my own and that I am supporting the EFG with her weight loss, so I do need to buy a few items.  And pay for a piano lesson.So I just opened the latest Sealed Pot, and we have cash!  With the pot's money, and the other bits and bobs I picked up from here and there, I have about £80 in cash.  More than enough for the week.  Thank Goodness for sealed pots.  And it means that I am ready to start SFT's new Sealed Pot challenge in December with an empty pot, hungry and ready to be filled again!Overall this month, we are getting along quite well. The total amount put in savings so far this month amounts to £600, and the amount I need to save before the end of the year has consequently gone down a little to just  £739.92, which I believe is very do-able.  I would like to get another £150 in there this month, which will leave about £590 to go.  I know that I have the gymnastics after school income to come when I invoice for it in December, and the first of the book sales is coming up at the end of the week.  Every penny counts!  Another will be on the 1st December [to be confirmed] and the last will be on the 9th December.  Between the three sales, I hope to exceed my £100 target for those.This week is definitely a Grocery Challenge week so that should help to s-t-r-e-t-c-h things out a little longer."},

{"title": "The Traveller", "date": "Thursday 15 November 2012", "text": "We saw him again today.  I think I have told you about him before.  We see him roughly every 6 - 8 months perhaps, usually walking northwards; somehow we miss his southerly journey, and we are probably not catching him every time he goes north.Tonight I dropped the YFG off at her piano lesson with her friend and decided to take the EFG and head further north than we usually go, to a town which has an Aldi.  I wanted to get one of their four-bird-roasts for Christmas as I have heard very good things about them.  It was definitely getting dark, just after 4pm, and all of a sudden, we caught sight of him on the other side of the road, facing the southbound traffic.  Now he is wearing a high visibility coat [thank goodness] and he is carrying bags, just a couple, but that is more than he had last time we saw him - perhaps someone has given him a blanket, or he has bought one somewhere....By the time we returned along the road at about 5.15pm, he was nowhere to be seen, and we both wondered where he could have gone - has he holed up in a shed somewhere for the night, has he reached a destination somewhere in that area, has someone given him a bed for the night?  We had bought some food that we could have given him if we had found him again, but of course, we don't know if he would have accepted it.He is an older gentleman of the road, with a grey beard and a weather beaten face. He feels to me like a Fenlander, at home on the road, travelling where he will, and answerable to no one.  He is mysterious and intriguing, and I would love to know his story, but I don't suppose we ever will.  Each time I see him, I am glad that he is still here, alive and walking, but I do wonder where he goes.(image from seeklogo.com)As I said here, I was inspired by Sue to go and use some of the vouchers I have which are about to expire.  Yesterday afternoon in Boots, I bought 10 of those same shower gels, and 2 packs of Boots hair dye which I use, which was also on a \"Buy 2 for £6\" offer instead of their usual £4.07 each.  Then I let the YFG choose a little gift for a friend who is having their birthday tomorrow, with the remaining £4 on the voucher.  Voucher well spent, and thanks for the inspiration, Sue!When my Dad visited on Sunday, he brought me a CD that one of the family has had made from an old tape of my great grandfather preaching in Cottenham Methodist Chapel in Cambridgeshire. It was the service to mark his 70th year as a preacher in that circuit.  What an achievement!  He was about 91 years old.I listened to the CD yesterday afternoon whilst I was ironing, and it was inspirational. So much of what he said then is still relevant today.  It dates from about 1959, we think: he also wrote a pamphlet of about 50 pages in 1949 to mark the 60th year.  There is a copy of the pamphlet in the county archives, so I hope to be able to go to read it after Christmas."},

I've learned a lot of languages - I have GCSEs in French, German, Russian and Latin (all As except the Latin which was a C - I started it two years later than everybody else in the class!), and then I studied Hebrew and Greek in university.  I think that may be enough!2. There is a 35 year age gap between the FH and I.3. I don't eat wheat, corn, soya or dairy products.  To say why would be TMI. 4. When the EFG was born the paediatrician asked me why I hadn't stopped smoking when I became pregnant, as it was my fault that the EFG was such a wee thing at 5lb 8ozs.  I took  pleasure in telling her that I hadn't [and still haven't] smoked a single cigarette in my life, so she needed to think again.(image from movieactors.com)5.  My all time favourite film is the original Dr Zhivago with Omar Sharif and Julie Christie.6.  I've come to the conclusion that I love collecting recipes a tiny bit more than I actually love to cook.  It is in my nature to collect information of all kinds!7.  I don't want a Kindle.  I prefer real books.8.  I'm quite a procrastinator when I have to do something I really don't fancy doing - I will fill the time with all sorts of things in order to not get around to doing whatever it is I don't want to do!9.  I wish I could crochet.10.  I miss my mum every day - she's been gone nearly 15 years and I think of her every day.  But I see her in myself and in the EFG....she's not far away.11.  I love to drive - it is definitely in my blood - Mum and Dad could both drive buses.  Perhaps I will be able to drive something sizeable one day!  I used to love driving the motorhome.That is my contribution - thanks for reading xx"},

{"title": "Inspiring news", "date": "Thursday 8 November 2012", "text": "(image from dailyrecord.co.uk)Many of you will remember that the FH has had a heart transplant.  He is now almost 13 and a half years post transplant, and he was heading for his 62nd birthday when it was done - so quite late in life in transplant terms.  We were blessed that the team at Glasgow Royal Infirmary were up for doing the job, because when we tried to transfer from the waiting list there to the one at Papworth, the doctors there told the Scottish team that they wouldn't take him on because of his age.  God bless Scotland!It was on the local news this morning that this chap, John McCafferty, is celebrating achieving 30 years of life after his heart transplant - what an achievement!  We know that given the normal span of life, the FH is unlikely to achieve that, but we are truly grateful for each and every day that he does have with us, and the YFG recently had to discuss transplantation as part of her Philosophy & Ethics (what we used to call RE) at school.  She wrote in her book that she is definitely in favour of transplantation because otherwise her dad wouldn't be here with her today."},
{"title": "Planning for the holidays", "date": "Wednesday 7 November 2012", "text": "There are lots of bloggers talking about Christmas now, so I thought I might as well stick my twopennorth in and have my say too!I'm all for frugality at Christmas, but what I am not up for is meanness - we all know that there is a difference.  There is a huge difference between deciding not to be sucked in to the whole Christmas spending spree mentality, of have-it-now-and-pay-next-year, the advertising agencies who want us to spend, spend, spend, satisfying imagined wants and needs and the opposite, which for me, is carefully considered purchases that might benefit a charity or a cause in some way, and be relevant to the person for whom the gift is intended.  A home made gift is often appreciated and welcomed, as much for the thought and effort as for the actual gift.So what will Christmas in the Fens look like?Our faithful old tree from 1992 will come out of the garage again, and be decorated with the collection of red, silver, gold and green baubles and bits that we have collected over the years.  No need for any spending in that department at all.  It looked lovely last year, just as it did back in 2008.The \"special\" food will be limited to Christmas Day and probably Boxing Day, when traditionally we have UJ and the FH's cousins here for lunch and/or tea.  Christmassy food will be mostly home made but that which is bought will be in sensible amounts, and not enough to feed a small army!  I am looking forward to getting the cakes made this week, and then I may well move on to making some mincemeat for the pies.  Gifts will be restrained this year in that the girls are only expecting token presents in their stockings as they have had their main presents already for their birthdays [Nintendo 3DS] which they understood would be birthday and Christmas gifts.  I will enjoy finding some small and fun items to stuff their stockings with - girly items like nail varnishes, as well as stationery, toiletries, socks and books, perhaps....Gifts for people outside the immediate family are fairly well controlled - usually just for children and older people!  I have a list, and I have already sourced a few items on the list.  I have plans for the others, and I am waiting until I see a bargain when I am out and about before I make the purchases.  Older people are easier than children in that I know they will appreciate home made food goodies, whereas children are perhaps a little more challenging for me.  Christmas for us is about celebrating the birth of Jesus, and with me helping to take the service at church on the 23rd, and completely in charge of the Christmas morning service, I will be spending time preparing for those.  Thoughts will be given and invitations issued to some of the people we know who will be alone over the period, and perhaps they will join us for tea one day, or we will visit them with some gifts of home made cakes, or mince pies.  Christmas can be a horrible time for people who have no relatives locally and then they find that all their usual social activities close down for a week or more in the holidays and their loneliness is doubled.Christmas is also about spending time together as a family and doing things together - dragging the EFG away from her homework and stuff in her bedroom and encouraging her to spend some time downstairs for a while now and again, getting the FH and UJ engrossed in the new Christmas jigsaw, which is a tradition here, and enjoying some time without outside commitments!There will be no overdraft, and no massive credit card bills to remind us of the festive season long into 2013, and I will enjoy spending a few hours with the finances over the holiday working out the budgets and financial goals for 2013.  I will be making my usual donation to the Salvation Army, in recognition of the amazing work that they do for the homeless, the elderly and those in need.Our local towns  put up Christmas lights for the season, and it is a particular joy to have a late afternoon stroll through them to see the lights shining.  We never go to the switching on ceremonies, though, as they are festivals of consumerism with stalls and food stands everywhere, with the streets heaving with people and it is too much of a hassle to be a pleasure! (image from timeout.com)I post a few Christmas cards to friends and relatives who I am not likely to see at Christmas, but most other people get one at church, at school or just whenever I see them before the big day.  I will write them and then keep them in the car, so that I can hand-deliver them whenever we are out and about.  The price of stamps has made sending too many cards prohibitive this year, and I can see many more people turning to the internet to send their good wishes at Christmas.Those are my thoughts on our plans for Christmas - I have enjoyed reading other blogs and getting ideas and inspirations too, so I may share some links in the days ahead."},
{"title": "Menu planning ", "date": "Tuesday 6 November 2012", "text": "This week has started with a bang with commitments yesterday, and the holiday seems so long ago already that I can't believe how quickly the time has flown past me.  The YFG had a great day in London yesterday, more excited about getting held up in a traffic jam and realising that the coach was outside 221B Baker Street [\"BAKER STREET, Mum, we were in BAKER Street!] than the Museum, where they were looking at ecology and then volcanoes - wish I could have gone too as volcanoes were my favourite part of Geography!  Anyway, she is home safe and sound.Just wanted to say Hello and Welcome to my two new followers - glad to have you here, and do say Hello in the comments sometime!And so to the meals for the week........Last night, the FH and I had one of the butcher-shop rabbits from Holt, and I have to say that I enjoyed it, although it tasted quite strong.  The children declined and had to make do with freezer diving to find alternatives.Today is gymnastics, and I plan to leave them with a shepherd's pie that they can eat whilst I am at gym.  This plan has worked well in previous weeks.Wednesday I have a small after school gym club in the village to run, and so it is a busy day again - I think that meatballs with spaghetti and pasta sauce would be quick and easy.Thursday is the piano lesson after school, but we will be home by 5pm, I think, this week, so I may well roast a chicken, so that we have leftovers for Friday.On Friday, I will have cold chicken, which would be nice with mash and veg and some pickles, perhaps.  All the FH has to do whilst we are at gym is turn on a saucepan to cook the veg.  Should be a doddle!On Saturday, a home made vegetarian pizza will ring the changes, as we will have had quite a few meat based meals this week.Sunday will be a surprise because I will have to have a good root around in the freezer to see what we have left by then.I am finding that this planning is helping with the stock control and budgeting so I am going to try to continue it for the rest of the term."},

{"title": "2013 dates already", "date": "Sunday 4 November 2012", "text": "(image from colourbox.com)I can't believe how quickly this year is disappearing!  Now that we are in November, we are getting appointments and dates made for times ahead in 2013 and I thought it was time to get the new household planner made for 2013.  I spent an hour earlier this week printing off pages from this website, and picked out a 19p binder from the stash in the stationery cupboard, along with a 56p set of page dividers I had bought from a \"reduced to clear\" bin at the supermarket.I have set it all up just as I described here in October since this plan has worked well for me this year.Marking up people's birthdays is the fun part, but I will also mark the calendar pages with school holidays, and the appointments from the various doctors and consultants that the FH sees are put on there as soon as we get them.  I also insert all the dates on which payments are due into our accounts so that I can keep an eye on the bank balances more easily - one is paid monthly and stays the same each month, but the others are paid four-weekly, so they vary each month.  My income is invoiced and paid at irregular times as well, since some of it depends on chicken breeding and sales, and some on gymnastics.  I obviously can't mark that up!The next part of my financial plan will be to look at the spending over the year, and plan goals for 2013.  For sure, it won't involve buying two new-to-us cars, but it might need a little home renovation work - the shower room ceiling may need re-skimming, and we definitely need a new bath panel....."},
{"title": "Not in my kitchen, Nigel", "date": "Saturday 3 November 2012", "text": "(image from bbc.co.uk)Now, don't get me wrong, I like Nigel Slater.  I love watching his tv programmes and I have a good selection of his books, but it is his mode of grocery shopping which I cannot abide.He empties the fridge [not got a problem with that - seems sensible] but then he wanders around the shops and buys whatever takes his fancy.....There are two kinds of grocery management which I can get to grips with, and I do a bit of both - the pantry principle [you buy what is on sale and eat from your cupboards] and meal planning [you plan your meals and buy what you need to make those meals] but his idea seems a bit too laid back for me, and I suspect that in real life, he is just feeding himself and his partner and he can get away with this sort of thing.  Households full of children needing to be taken places after school rule this sort of shopping out for a lot of us.  I suspect that it is not that economical either, although he does talk often about making the most of his ingredients."},
{"title": "More holiday photos", "date": "Friday 2 November 2012", "text": "This is the peace and quiet of the caravan site - a 240 acre woodland with walks and paths through it to the static caravans, whereas the touring caravans and tents are on more open heathland.  The sunlight through the trees can be especially pretty.This shows the path through the woods down towards the railway line.  When we got down through the woods to the railway line, I was thrilled to hear the chuff-chuff sound of the steam train coming up the hill!  We sat at the camp halt and waited to see the train pass within a foot or two of where we sat!  I believe this is called the Poppy Line and it runs from Sheringham to Holt, stopping at Weybourne.  Trains do stop at the camp halt but only on the return journey when it is downhill!My favourite view from the camp halt across the fields towards Weybourne and the windmill there.Slightly to the left of the first view, in larger versions, you can see Sheringham Shoal wind turbines in the sea in this shot - faint white lines in the sea on the horizon.  Click on the picture and make it bigger and then you will see them!I do enjoy the woodland and the trees in this area - it is SO different from the flatness of the Fens!Can you spot the squirrel in the middle of this picture?  It has a mouth full of leaves, which it then took up into the trees into its drey, high above the path.  We stood and watched it for several minutes, and it took quite a roundabout route to get to the little home it had made in the treetops, then another squirrel came along and went much more directly to the drey."},
{"title": "All Saints", "date": "Thursday 1 November 2012", "text": "(photo from www.ramptonchurch.org)This is All Saints' Church, in Rampton, about 10 or so miles north of Cambridge.  It is my childhood church, the one I attended every Sunday from the earliest memories I have, right up until I was nearly 19 and leaving home to go to university.  We moved out of the village two years earlier, but still travelled down the hill to worship here.(photo credit as above)I remember many years of worship in this church, many traditions and much community spirit and love shared amongst the congregation there.  It wasn't a huge congregation all the time, it ebbed and flowed as they do, but there were some amazing characters there who I learned a lot from.  They were mostly older people, who had time to talk to a young girl, and share memories.I no longer worship in the Church of England tradition, having moved over or out to Methodism now but I am very grateful that I have found another church home where I feel as welcome and as valued as I did back then.  The denomination may have changed, the building in which I worship has changed and the style of worship is incredibly different, but it is the same God, and He is worthy to be praised.  I like to think back and remember this old church on All Saints' Day, because that is remembered in its name."},
{"title": "We're back!", "date": "Wednesday 31 October 2012", "text": "Sheringham on Monday afternoonWe left the caravan at 8.45am this morning, and reached home via Tesco at 10.45am, so that was not bad going at all.  We had to get some fresh veg on the way home, and there was no sense in going back for it later when we were going past the door on the way home!The FH has been out to his lunch club and the YFG has been delivered to her party this afternoon.  The FH has now got his feet up watching a film, getting his rest up for his first trip of the week to Papworth tomorrow.  I have got the washing machine going to catch up.Kelling Heath woodlands - a walk yesterday afternoon - photo by the EFG on her phone!Arriving at the caravan on Sunday afternoon, we had to get the heating on quick smart as it was FREEZING in there!  It was just like an ice house, and the beds and everything were very chilly, so we bustled about and got things warm.  We settled in for the afternoon and evening, and sorted out our various amusements - knitting, reading, watching tv, the girls disappeared off to their room to watch a DVD at one point, and we all enjoyed a rest.  On Monday, all of us enjoyed a lie-in until 9am - it was bliss!  We pottered around in Cromer and Sheringham, visiting our favourite shops, and purchasing the much loved Christmas jigsaw by Ravensburger. We were home again by 3pm and enjoying our time of peaceful relaxations!  Much knitting has been done these few days, and whole books read!  I have read a Lee Child thriller, from the library and the girls each chose to spend the pocket money my dad gave them on some books, and they have read them already.  The YFG's sense of achievement at completing a book in several hours has been a joy to see.  The weather on Monday was dry but dull and cold.  We found the house in Cromer which I am interested in renting as a holiday home for a week sometime next year, and I think is very suitably positioned - just off the main street past the church, at the back of the RNLI museum and slipway - close to the shops in one direction and the beach in the other.  What more could I ask for?!  The cinema is just around the corner too...Also from yesterday's walk - from high on the caravan site in the woods, across the fields to Weybourne village and out to sea - Sheringham Shoal wind turbines are just visible to the naked eye when you are there but the camera on the phone hasn't been able to pick them out.On Tuesday we headed inland to Holt after a very laid back morning - I read my book in bed until nearly 10.30 after fetching tea and breakfast!  Holt has an altogether different feel from the other two towns, and I like it just as much.  We went round to the Christmas shop, where we just looked at the glitzy decorations.  I bought some fresh rabbit for the pot from a butcher just along from there, and froze it to bring it home.  We had a delightful rummage in a little shop in the courtyard near the car park, called Great to be Green where my thoughts turned immediately to Froogs because I found a large collection of utility ware crockery in palest green, blue and yellow.  I resisted the temptation to buy a jug just like the one my mum used to have, but I did purchase a lovely white embroidered tablecloth for just £3 for the chapel.It was lovely to drive home this morning through the trees, as it made me feel very autumnal.  The colours of the foliage are just glorious at this time of the year - all the yellows, greens, russets, red, orange, and browns melting together in one riot of colour.  We have to drive through some heavily wooded areas where the road goes under canopies of trees, and it is quite gloomy under there, and then the road bursts out the other side, and if the sun is shining, the contrast is amazing.  I was happy to be able to get out with the girls yesterday and take some time to walk through the woods, enjoying the scenery and the fresh air.  I am very glad to be home today and able to sit by the fire tonight, but we have enjoyed our little Norfolk jaunt."},

The trouble at the moment is that the washing is piling up faster than I have room to dry it....answers to the challenge?  Well, I could get more airers made, I suppose, so that I can hang more of it on them and use them in the verandah as well as near the fire.  The FH could probably make some more, but it may be cheaper to buy those plastic ones rather than the wood to make wooden ones.  I'll look into that. I have been sorely tempted by the lakeland heated airer, but at nearly £90, I shall be thinking more than twice about that.  I am resisting temptation and looking for more frugal methods first. Doing less washing would be another option, but actually, we are pretty good here at not washing everything after using or wearing it just the once!  We do have to challenge the girls over towels occasionally - a towel doesn't need to be washed just because it is damp from having been used as a turban on wet hair, but it would seem that sometimes it is easier to lob it into the washing basket than it is to hang it up to dry on the rack!  They are learning, though.I have to say that I am really looking forward to the cold snap which is forecast for these next few days as the clearer skies will mean that the sun will shine on the verandah and the temperature will rise in there!  Time to get the washing machine going, and make the most of the opportunity, I think."},

{"title": "Elderly woes", "date": "Sunday 21 October 2012", "text": "The FH has a friend in the village who is in his early 90s, and generally quite fit and well for his age.  He is a bit of a cantankerous old chap at times, but they get along and he is one of the mates that the FH takes out on trips. Unfortunately, he has no close family, and his relatives (late wife's sister and her daughter) live about 50 miles away, and don't come to see him as often as they used to.  He has lately started to telephone us around 7am in the mornings, saying that he needs the FH and doesn't feel well.....it was 6.45am on Monday, and this morning it was 7.25am......as much as I understand that he is an elderly chap, and might be ill, most of the time when the FH gets there, he just wants to sit and have a cup of tea and a chat.  He may have had a sleepless night, and has been lonely overnight and wants company.  I understand that - night times are always the worst if you are feeling rough, or lonely.He has expressed a desire to go and live in a nearby residential home, so he asked the FH to take him there to have a look.  This was done, and he liked the look of it.  When he was due to go to spend a day there to see if it was what he imagined, he was ill.  He has since said that he wants to die in his own home, and then said again that the home is where he wants to go.  He can't seem to make his mind up, and I see that it would be an awfully big upheaval for him at his time of life, and perhaps quite overwhelming for him. Can anyone offer us any advice if they have helped an elderly person in this sort of situation? My concern is that the FH is not a young man himself and can't keep running to this chap's bidding in the early mornings two or three times a week; it would be different if he was really ill, but he hasn't been.  The FH has called the doctor out to him twice in order to have him checked out, and he is there again now, waiting for another doctor to come - it is a Sunday service, of course, so he will have to wait some time as it is not the village doctor."},

Tomorrow is going to be a horrendously busy day - I am in school at 9.30 for a meeting, 2.45pm to do the gym after-school club and then again at 6.30pm for a committee meeting.  So they are having tuna pasta again.   You will notice a certain amount of repetition in this meal plan - we are in Stoptober, we are using up what we have got, and we have plenty of pasta!(image from lidl.co.uk)Thursday, the FH has a bee club meeting, and I have to take the girls to town to piano lessons, so there will be a small window of opportunity to get everyone fed.  Those that can eat FB pies [that's Fray Bentos, not Facebook!} will have one of those with mash and veg and those of us who can't will be getting small lamb steaks with the same.Friday's plan from last week of hot cheese sandwiches and soup went down very well, so they can have those again!Saturday, I am inspired by Angela at Tracing Rainbows to try Froogs' Fabulous Frugal Faggots!  They look lovely and I am hoping that there will be some for the freezer to enjoy later the next week too.  I have a little more time on Saturdays for cooking, so it is the time to try something new.On Sunday, I need to invest time in making two batches of ragu sauce, and we will eat one batch on Sunday as a Shepherd's Pie, and sink the other batch in the freezer for a quick supper later in the week.On Monday I will be at school all day interviewing, I hope, if we have some applicants!  So that night will be a quick veggie stew with herby dumplings.  Made in a few minutes and enjoyed by all.Tuesday night there is no gym next week, so I am free to help at the Harvest Supper at the chapel so there will be no supper cooked here.  If anyone doesn't want to come to chapel, they will be having something simple at home of their own making - beans on toast, perhaps, or pasta.(image from hopnews.com)I plan to bring that other portion of ragu sauce out on Wednesday and make some Spaghetti Bolognese with it.  Fast and easy, but still home made.Thursday's plan may change, but at the moment the YFG won't be here as she will be eating dinner at school and helping out at a new intake evening.  It is the ideal opportunity to have pork, so we may have sweet and sour pork that night.Friday I think we can continue the soup and sandwiches routine, or perhaps I will make a home made pizza. No gym!On Saturday we will be having a bit of a use-it-up meal as we will be going away the next day after chapel, and leaving UJ in charge.  Not fair to expect him to eat our leftovers, so we will take care of any odds and ends lurking in the fridge that night!I found it very helpful last week to have this all planned out, and it was a good week, without me flailing about wondering what we could have!  I am pleased with the outcome, so I am going to attempt to commit to doing this every week.  Hopefully it will become less repetitive over time, but as I said, this is Stoptober, so we are using what we have in the freezer and cupboards.We have agreed terms with my sister and booked the caravan for three nights.  She has put the price up a little to account for the price of the gas going up, so at least there should be gas to keep us warm!We will be going after church on the Sunday, and staying until Wednesday morning.  Therefore we will basically have the Monday and Tuesday to get out and about.  The girls are a little disappointed not to be there on the Saturday for Sheringham market day, but other appointments are making that impossible this time.We can still go to Sheringham (below) and mooch through the town, towards the sea front.(image from ramblefest.com)We also like to visit Cromer and perhaps partake of some fish and chips from MaryJane's shop.(image from wikipedia.com)Holt is a beautiful Georgian town just inland a few miles, and between Fakenham and the caravan.  There are some lovely independent shops there which we enjoy browsing - we are keen to see if the Christmas shop is still there!(image from history-tourist.com)I just know that we will have to stop at Morrison's in Fakenham on the way to the caravan!(image from geopgraph.org.uk)And this might be the venue for a day out - Holkham Hall - a very fine Palladian mansion house on the coast.  We have been there before, and the girls and I love to walk around the house and have the tour, whereas the FH prefers to doze in the car!  We may not get around to this on this occasion as time will be short, but it is an option.(image from telegraph.co.uk)I hope that if the weather stays fine, we could be doing some walking in the woodlands at the caravan park(image from geograph.org.uk)I am sure I will be taking some of this with me to keep my hands busy in the evenings!(image from dooyoo.co.uk)But before we go, I will have to be doing quite a lot of this to get the house ready for UJ to caretake!!(image from maria-cleaning.co.uk)"},

{"title": "Here I am, Lord", "date": "Sunday 14 October 2012", "text": "We sang this song at the chapel this morning, and it really hit a chord with me, so I'd like to share it.I found a great, highly recommended muffin recipe on the Australian Simple Savings website, in the forum section.  It is economical because you can bung in whatever you have handy for the flavourings, and it uses a very simple base recipe that anyone could remember!  We have a Simple Saver called Lauren to thank for this one!The recipe is basic, so basic, but SO effective.  This is what we did:I took two cup measures of SR flour, and added a cup measure of caster sugar to it, and mixed them together in a bowl.  In a separate bowl, I mixed together half a cup of oil with half a cup of milk and an egg.  I beat them together before adding them to the dry ingredients. For the flavouring of this batch, I wanted lemon, so I grated the rind of one [rather old] lemon, and put that in a little dish with some caster sugar and gave it a jolly good stir. I prepared the muffin cases in the tins, and then put a blob of mixture in the bottom of each case, before adding a half a teaspoon of lemon curd to each.  I topped each one off with a little more mixture, and then sprinkled each with about half a teaspoon of the lemon sugar mixture.I was then surprised to find that the quantities only made a dozen, so I set to and made it all again!  These cook in about 15 minutes in my oven, set at 160C [it is a fan oven].  The top of each one went beautifully crisp and golden, and the family thought they were delicious. Since I had the oven on to cook a chicken for supper today, I made a further double batch of these, and another double batch of chocolate ones, in which I added two dessertspoons of cocoa to the dry mixture and added a tiny square of chocolate to the middle of each one!  The YFG says they are lovely. I have all the remaining chocolate ones and two dozen lemon ones in the freezer, and the YFG has stashed one lemon one in her lunchbox for tomorrow.I haven't worked out how cheap these are to make, but I know that each one is going to cost just pennies, and the basic recipe is so versatile that I am sure I will be trying out other variations!"},

{"title": "International Day of the Girl", "date": "Thursday 11 October 2012", "text": "Since I have helped with the #shareniger awareness, I have been asked to help to highlight the plight of young girls in early arranged marriages.  World Vision have a campaign on the go entitled \"International Day of the Girl\" which is today, to try to bring this to more people's attention. Amira - whose quote is below - picture from worldvision.org.ukI was aware of arranged marriages, and had heard vague stories of young girls being spirited away from the UK on holiday and ending up married and living with their new in-laws in remote areas of India, for example.  But I hadn't given it a lot of thought.  Shame on me.I should have done.  I have two daughters, aged 13 and 16 this year, and if they had been living in some of these countries, they could both have been sent away, married and had several babies each by now.  They would have lost their independence, their choices in life, and their opportunities to have careers.  It seems that these girls are being traded like commodities and not treated as real people with thoughts and minds of their own.  Thank goodness that people are waking up to this and setting up support groups to prevent it happening.There are a number of things we can all do to help, and you should have a look at the World Vision website here: http://www.worldvision.org.uk/get-involved/international-day-of-the-girl/ and see if there is anything on their list of suggestions that you can do.  Even just blogging raises awareness, and that can be the start of something much bigger.Reading through the material, I found quotes like these and they are heart-breaking:“When my father told me I was going to be married off, I felt my life had been ruined. I visualized a life like that of my mother - marriage, lots of children. All dreams shattered.” Chaitali, 10 – Bangladesh“I couldn’t believe my ears. I burst into loud cry and my eyes were filled with tears. I begged her kneeling down to cancel the marriage, but she said no.” Amira, 10 – Ethiopia. “It was not voluntary and I became very angry when I heard about. It was a sudden agony to me. I felt I would have no chance for education. My hope for development darkened.’’ Kassa, 14 – Ethiopia\"I was 17 years old at that time. I don't know if I had a choice or not. All I knew is that I had to obey my parents.\" Krishna, 24 - India ‘Early marriage is dangerous for a girl. I was thinking that if I got married at that age it was nothing but to choose the cave of death. Promita, 16 – Bangladesh.I do love a good spreadsheet!  This year, I have been using a big pink lever arch file - a repurposed one which the EFG had been using for Biology - and in it, I have a set of dividers, marked up for each month of the year.(image from made-in-china.com)Behind each month, I have a calendar page for that month, on which I can write appointments and commitments for everyone; this doesn't replace my diary, where I have a whole page to a day and can write in more detail, but I use the page to indicate things like \"Gym\", \"Piano\" \"Hosp 1.30\" so that I know what is going on each day.  I usually print the pages from a website like this one although there are plenty of others like this out there.  Of course, people do design their own as well!On that calendar page, I write the credit cards' due dates and amounts so that I am sure to pay them on time!  We have three cards and keep them all for separate things - I have one for specific use on one particular website, another more general one that I use, and collect points on, and there is one for the FH to use, which I don't use!  They are all paid up each month, quite faithfully.  Once they are paid, the note has a huge tick put through it, and the date I paid it on.I will also write notes on the calendar page about things like house insurance running out, MOTs expiring or memberships needing to be renewed.  I look at this page every day so it is a good place to make sure I note things that I don't want to forget....(image from ehow.com)Behind that page each month, I have a \"spending page\" where I record all the spending each month.  It is broken down into categories like \"Food\", \"Fuel\", \"Toiletries\", \"Books/Gifts/DVDs\" so that I know exactly what is being spent in which area.  I also have a column for \"Savings\" so that I know when I have transferred money over and how much.  At the top of each column is an amount which I would like to stick to [or under] for each category for the month. This spreadsheet does not take into account the direct debit payments which come out of the bank automatically each month, for Council Tax, electricity, etc and that sort of thing.  All that stuff is recorded on another one, but by focussing on the discretionary spending each month, I can make changes to the budget and to the money we are saving month after month.  These are things upon which we can make more detailed choices and where I find the biggest impact on the budget.  I can't alter the Council Tax, so there is no point worrying about that, and the electricity bill is another thing that I can't alter month on month - although I have lowered it by switching suppliers. In the monthly sections of the folder, I also file all the credit card bills for that month, any other bills which come in, and are paid that month.  Any important letters from hospitals, schools, etc are also filed in the relevant month, as well as receipts and delivery notes from places like AF if I have a delivery.  School trip letters are filed in the month of the trip, not the month it was paid for, as there is often important information on those letters about clothing requirements and pick up times.I have gone paperless on bank statements now, but earlier in the year, I was also filing bank statements in these sections. I have been really pleased with this system for us this year, and I think I will do it again next year, unless I find a better way, as I know that there are lots of options out there.  For me, it is the balance between keeping my finger firmly on the family's financial pulse, and keeping it simple."},

The meal plan for this week looks like this:Tuesday [gym/hockey night] - Shepherd's Pie - made and chilled for them to help themselves as this worked really well the other week.  And there was a little left for me when I got home!Wednesday [Guides night] - Sticky chicken - chicken thighs cooked in a simple sauce, and easily done in the mini-oven to reduce electricity costs too.  This will be served with veg.  I will be at home in the afternoon so I can have this ready to eat before Guides.  The FH will have eaten a meal at the lunch club, so this is just for the girls and I; he and UJ will have a sandwich and a piece of cake.Thursday [Piano lesson] - Sausages/pork chops - the YFG can't eat a piece of pork but she can eat sausages, so we have to accommodate that when we have pork.  Two pork chops have been languishing in the freezer for quite long enough!  This will be served with veg and gravy.Friday [gymnastics] - Soup and hot toasted sandwiches - I won't be home until 8pm and I will be tired, so  I am planning an easy night - there is soup in the freezer as well as a few tins in the cupboard, so they can choose soup and have some hot cheese sandwiches with it.  Easy night all round!Saturday [gymnastics & ballet] - Meatballs and spaghetti with sauce - and possibly veg as well. We do eat a lot of veg and I currently have fresh cauliflower, carrots, broccoli and cabbage in the fridge, along with peppers and mushrooms.  The YFG is not keen, but will eat fruit like nobody's business, and the EFG is very good with her veg. Sunday will depend on what we fancy and what is left in the depths of the freezer - there is some fish in there, some belly pork, more mince, and lots of chicken breasts, so there are plenty of options.Last night was a DIY kind of menu...the FH took a friend out to look at a local residential home in another village and was treated to a steak and kidney pie lunch in a pub, so he didn't need a lot for supper!  He just had the leftovers of the casserole and dumplings meal from the night before, but probably didn't eat as much as he would have done if he hadn't had the S&K pie.  The YFG had the last piece of battered fish in the box, and the EFG and I shared two lamb steaks from a pack reduced to clear in Tesco.  We all had veg with our various bits and pieces!"},

It seems to me to be wrong to have to say to people that we welcome donations but they have to be Fairtrade; we are just extremely grateful for anything we are given.It is like this in life, and I would never look a gift horse in the mouth, as the saying goes.  If someone has something to give me, I am always grateful for the thought, if not the actual item every time, and accept whatever it is that they are giving to me.  I may then keep it, donate it to a charity shop or give it to someone I know who has a greater need for the item.  But I am always polite to the person who passed it on to me.  If you are rude, I am sure that your supply of donated items would soon dry up. We are clearing out the spare bedroom this afternoon, and some old paint spattered clothes are heading for a rag bag, but I have set aside some of the YFG's black school trousers for another child I know who has less muscular legs, so I think that they will fit her.  I have sorted out a heap of books which will be offered to the school next week, and I think I have found a box of colouring pencils which can go in the colouring cupboard at chapel.  My collection of Dickens books are one thing which the FH and I are disagreeing upon; in the year of Dicken's 200th anniversary, they are definitely not getting passed on!"},
{"title": "Realising how blessed we are", "date": "Friday 5 October 2012", "text": "(image from www.bbc.co.uk)The FH and I watched a programme one night this week about life in India.  It was eye-opening, and I was  shocked at how people live in what I thought was a reasonably developed country - I know it is not up there with the US and the UK in terms of living standards, but I hadn't realised just how far behind some areas of it are.  And yet the programme description shows that it sets out to celebrate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the two main people that this programme was about - one man who makes a living sweeping the streets of the jewellery district in order to collect gold dust, and another man who lives in a shack on the beach with his family, has debts with the local moneylender, and who has a \"pub\" in his house most evenings selling illegal liquor.We saw the chap who deals in gold dust being lowered into a street drain in order to excavate the sludge from the drain, so that he could sell it to another person who had a large organisation where the sludge could be washed and refined to extract the gold from it.  He went to look at a room in a house, and he was shown the shared \"bathroom\" which was filthy beyond my wildest imaginings and it seemed to be shared amongst all the rooms on the staircase.The man who lived in the beach shack had to tear it down one day to prevent it being destroyed by the council bulldozers, and then his wife had to build it up again when they had gone - she was a little peeved that she had to do most of the work.  And she was serving customers the liquor as she was rebuilding the little house around them.We also saw a gang of young guys who sell books to people in cars when they are stopped at a junction at traffic lights - they are illegal copies of books, and they sell them at knock-down rates.  The gang live in the open air in the local cemetery, where we saw women cooking over fireplaces made from bricks, and then they all bedded down for the night on covers on the ground, including a very tightly swaddled baby, which was then just laid on the ground and covered up with another blanket.  They live like that, but they have mobile phones - one's mother was calling him from her home in a village outside the city to see if he was OK.It made me think of the Mennonite saying that we should \"live simply that others may simply live\" and it reminded me of the child I am helping to sponsor in Niger through the Parent Bloggers network.  Perhaps I should live even a little more simply in order to be able to help more.  Food for thought.I have successfully shed a stone and a half since May, and people are beginning to notice now.  The smaller trousers are coming out of the wardrobe, and I wore a skirt and jacket to my party last weekend that haven't seen the light of day for years.  It feels great!  I know I should still lose a little more, probably another stone, but I am not rushing things.  It will come off, just as the rest has, in its own time.  The scales are just dipping under the 11 now, whereas they were heading towards the 13, and it was time to stop that movement in it's tracks before I lost control!A lady at the school asked me which diet plan I was using, or whether it was just my own plan.  It is a very simple, and frugal, plan.  \"Eat less.  Feel hungry.  Move a little more.\" I think that we live in a culture where hunger is not appreciated.  Hunger pangs help you to know that you are truly hungry, or perhaps even just thirsty, and it helps you to know that you are not overeating if you do occasionally feel a little hungry. I used to snack a lot, and rarely felt hungry.  Now I eat when I am hungry, and it makes a difference.  I have to restrict the foods I eat because I can't eat wheat and dairy, but those helpful supermarkets produce plenty of unhealthy \"free from\" stuff that I could eat.  I've stopped eating that stuff, because it is full of sugar, and it has made a huge difference to me. Perhaps those thoughts will help someone else to lose a few pounds if that is what you need to do.  But it is MY plan, and it works for me.  The EFG has a different plan, which I have discussed before, and that is working for her, albeit a little more slowly than my plan, but she is a different person.  Each to their own."},

The FH and the EFG had sausages from the freezer with fritters which she makes from onion and carrot with cream and seasoning.  There was plenty of cream left over from the party on Saturday, so she used some of that up, as well as some tired-looking carrots.  That meal fits in with her plan too.The YFG and I shared a packet of lamb steaks and some broccoli from the freezer, and I had mine with the last two mushrooms and a piece of the last courgette from the garden and some of UJ's lovely fresh tomatoes, and the YFG enjoyed hers with a tin of spaghetti from the storecupboard. This morning I have had the last few grapes with a banana for my breakfast, and the FH is about to get another banana on a Weetabix, as the YFG needs some help eating the packet of Weetabix. We have no fruit or veg left, apart from a few tomatoes and two bananas....tonight I will have to do some shopping whilst the girls are at hockey.  I will be buying apples, grapes, carrots, mushrooms, bananas, and whatever I can find in the reduced section.  I may also have a look at some frozen veg which would keep longer, of course.  I have the budget in mind too!"},
{"title": "End of the month round up of the budget", "date": "Monday 1 October 2012", "text": "(image from www.bishopslaw.co.uk)Oh dear!  The end of the month round up of the figures has just proved what I already knew - September has been a bad month for spending!!Looking back at my records, I have had a number of payments to make for various people which have added to the burden for the month:£20+ on Chemistry text books for the EFG£30 on the half term's ballet fees for the YFG£37 gymnastics membership and insurance for the pair of them (annual payment)£17.50 on a Bible commentary for my Faith & Worship/preaching studies£47.98 on printer ink!£27.90 on school jumpers for the YFG and £12 on new school shoes for her£28.78 on the annual supply (2 litres) of gin for the sloe gin£25.00 on photographs of the YFG at her last gymnastics competitionI would say that only the last two items on that last were really extravagant!All these add up and make a difference - some of them are one off payments, and others, like ballet, are regular but not monthly.  The good news [there had to be some somewhere!] is that I have managed to get £650 into savings this month on top of coping with extra expenditure.The party and the Macmillan coffee morning at the weekend are also another drain on the budget for the month - I provided all the cakes for the Macmillan event bar one, as well as about 12 raffle prizes.  These have been saved up and bought cheaply in sales throughout the year, but they still have to be acquired.  This is a very worthy cause, and I am looking on my outlay as my donation to the cause.  The party itself probably cost me about £150 or so, in terms of food, flowers, decorations, birthday cakes, etc.  But I haven't had a birthday party of any kind since my 21st, and I doubt there will be another in a hurry, so it was money well spent.This month we have the house insurance renewal due so I will be looking round for savings on the renewal quote, and doing some  investigations through cashback websites.And that C-word - CHRISTMAS!!  We have the fudge recipe, the truffle recipe, and plenty of fancy card in the cupboard to make wee boxes, so I think that local friends are sorted that way.  I'm still looking for things I can post further afield.  On the subject of the truffle recipe - Tesco now sell orange flavoured chocolate spread so methinks there might be another possibility looming there.  A recipe adaptation might be on the cards.And so, looking forward to the month ahead, I am hoping to make inroads into my £5000 savings target for the year.  The total this morning sat at £3091.13 so I have a way to go, but if I can get £1000 in there this month, I will be very pleased.  That's the aim....watch this space for an update on the reality!I am going to be joining in with Frugal Queen's Stoptober challenge this month.  Although I think the name came from an anti-smoking campaign, Froogs is using it to make us think about Stopping Spending!Today is the first day of Stoptober, and I will be taking some time to do a menu plan for this week, and look deep into the depths of the freezer to use up what is left in there.  Sue over at the Quince Tree has been doing a storecupboard challenge, and I have been admiring her beautiful photography as usual, as well as taking note of some of her recipes.  I may be able to use a few of them this month.  I am also going to be having a look at the huge list of recipes on the Grocery Challenge on the Old Style boards at MSE.  There is also a list in the first one or two posts there about how to save money on grocery shopping and cooking.  I think I will be running back to back $21 challenges as I did back in January.But it is not just about food!  We are going to have a spending halt on lots of areas of spending.  Both cars have pretty much got full tanks of fuel right now, so that should keep them going for most of the month, and we will be careful about using the cars.  No one needs any new clothes or shoes, the house has enough cleaning materials stocked in the garage to keep it clean for more than a month, and there is no need to buy anything for the garden.  I am happy with the number of books I can get from the library, and I will not be buying any magazines this month, at all.  [That may be slightly painful, and Gill will understand!] I have plenty of wool for knitting, pens and paper for writing, and I have no need of many other things. Why am I doing this?  Well, the party cost me quite a little wad of money last weekend, and the children going back to school also had a financial impact with new bits and pieces that they needed.  We have already had one letter about a school trip for the YFG....It is appropriate to stop and take stock sometimes, and to be grateful for what we have, to make the most of the things we already have in the house, and to be released from making purchasing decisions for a month.  The decision is made, and in most cases, we won't be buying it.I'll be doing a round up of September's budget and spending later on today."},

SarahElisabeth has something going in the post that I promised some time ago as well - that will be posted today.I had got out of the habit of planning the week's meals, knowing that there was food in the freezer and cupboards that I could pull out each morning to be cooked in the evening.  The trouble was that we have had to re-adjust to getting back into the swing of term time activities again, and things have changed in that department a little.The EFG has started a hockey club on a Tuesday evening, at the same venue as the gym club, but at a different time.  So, consequently, it was a bit of a hiccup last week in the culinary department.  I went to school to pick the YFG up and took her to the gym, so I left here at 3pm.  The YFG has a snack at about 4.30pm when we have the gym equipment set up and then we have classes until 8pm.  The FH brought the EFG to the venue in time for hockey at 7.30pm, and he took the YFG home with him a little earlier than she would normally have left gym, because after gym, I had to sit and read a book until the hockey finished at 9pm.  The EFG and I arrived home at 9.15pm.  Hungry. I had had a sort of plan that the EFG would do herself a microwave baked potato and beans before hockey, and then the YFG would cook herself a piece of fish and some veg from the freezer when she got home after gym.  This they did, and I ate some leftovers at 9.30pm.  The FH managed to eat twice, as they each made enough for him as well when they made their meals!!It wasn't terribly good all in all. This week, I was more on the ball, and had some mince out of the freezer on Monday evening so that it was defrosted by Tuesday morning, and able to be cooked then into a shepherd's pie.  They both went to hockey this week, and were able to re heat portions of the pie before they went, and I had my portion when I got home. Tonight, I have thought about what to make again, as we have a fairly quick turnaround to get the EFG to Guides, so planning definitely helps!  My trouble is keeping it up, but I will try..."},

That would keep the FH very happy as they would be stored in the hard drive on the pc and not on the shelves here...he doesn't mind eating what I produce, or trying out the gardening ideas, but he isn't keen that I have the inspirational magazines \"cluttering up\" the house. Someone on the MSE forums has one of these gorgeous shelf  units from IKEA and on it she stores 10 years worth of Good Food magazines, as well as others.  I don't have 10 years of anything...I did think that the unit would be useful as it is possible to buy deep drawers to put in the cubes and I could see tablecloths and napkins nestling in a couple, as well as all the Wii paraphenalia in another, and even the board games would have a home.  The contents of the sideboard which would have been displayed in a \"china cabinet\" 30 years ago could actually see daylight for a change, and we could enjoy them instead of them being tucked away and never seen.  I might [might!] pop the odd book or two in random cubes, but it would hold so much and look useful.  They even come in different sizes, and I was toying between the 16 cube one or the 25 cube one.  It was a question of how long I could bear to be saving for it for - 16 cubes would be quicker!But No, I have been told that I can't have one.  Words were exchanged last night, and I went to bed rather angry.  Frustrated, perhaps. Because although I know that in a lot of ways, I am in charge of a lot of things here, I am only in charge because the FH allows me to be.  He makes the final decisions on things like cars, furniture, livestock and pets for example.  That's why we don't have a dog. No comments about feminism, thank you.  This is right, for me, for us, for this Christian family - just as the Christian family worldwide looks to God for leadership, this family looks to the head of the household, who is the FH.  He challenges me to do better, to grow more, to be stronger and more disciplined.  And that is right too.  So that lovely [yes, OK, I am not quite over it yet!] unit will not be mentioned any more, and I will look for other sorts of storage which are already here.  I am challenged!(Image from viking.co.uk)I have an Approved Foods order due tomorrow, and I just clicked the link to check how far it has got on its journey to the Fens.  Currently, the tracking page shows that it is at the \"Sortation Facility\"....Pardon?\"Sortation Facility\" - is that like a Sorting office at  Royal Mail, perhaps?  Some kind of central hub from where parcels are re-routed to their destinations? However, I am jolly sure that \"sortation\" isn't a word.According to my Collins Concise English dictionary (which isn't that concise because it is about two inches thick!), 'sort' can be a noun as in, \"He's a good sort.\" It can be a verb, to sort, in which one would be expected to differentiate between items, for example.  One who does sorting can be a \"sorter\", another noun.But sortation, no, that's not there!"},

Once home, I cooked my tea (everyone else had eaten at various times by then) and headed towards the bath.  I was rather pre-occupied last night, as I am this morning, by a disturbing incident which occurred last night at the gym, and although I slept last night, it has been on my mind because I am unsure of how the future will unfold because of it.  It may not blow over, and certain other people's actions may have longer term ramifications - I have done nothing wrong and just got caught in the middle between two other parties.So, this morning, I am in for a time of housework and rebooting the washing machine at intervals to get the mountain of washing under control!  The sun is shining and we will see what the day brings."},

{"title": "A question of how far...", "date": "Saturday 15 September 2012", "text": "How far would one go in the search of the frugal alternative?  For thrift's sake?We decided this week that a particular ginger cake recipe was probably a step too far, in these times, but that if we had lived in wartime, and were hungry, it would be acceptable.  Situations change, and what we would accept in one situation might be different, I think.I found a recipe for a wartime ginger cake in the Wartime Farm book, and I saw that the same recipe also appears in the Good Food magazine this month.  Their home economist remarks that it is a little dry and would be better eaten with custard.Anyway, the thing with this cake is the peculiarity of the ingredients.  Simply flour, golden syrup, bicarbonate of soda, ground ginger, and tepid water.  That's it.  No eggs, no fat of any kind.  It bakes ok and comes out looking like a traybake should.  The instructions say to wrap it and store it in a tin for at least two days.  I made it Wednesday evening, and it was sampled on Friday evening, so that would be about right.Chief taster, YFG, said, \"It's a bit chewy,\" but ate it!  The square has been reduced in the tin so someone has had some more, and the FH is getting some for pudding tonight with some of the recommended custard.  But I have a tremendous recipe from elsewhere for ginger cake, so I will be sticking to that one in the foreseeable future.Sometimes we just have to try these things, don't we?!"},
{"title": "Home made truffles", "date": "Friday 14 September 2012", "text": "Not the best photo in the world, but you get the idea!You will remember that there is a famous brand of delicious chocolates which are available in many shops; they are sold in clear perspex-type boxes, in which the individual sweeties are wrapped in gold paper and sit in a little brown case.  There has been a tv advertisement for them in the past featuring a huge heap of them!You know what I am talking about?They aren't cheap.  But, thanks to The Frugal Graduate, we have a way of making them much more affordable, which takes only about 20 minutes of your time.Check out that link to find the original recipe.  I made a few alterations!I bought ready roasted hazelnuts, so that cut out a huge section of the recipe and meant I could just chuck them straight in with the bashed-with -the end-of-the-rolling-pin ice cream wafers.  I then used Tesco's own brand chocolate hazelnut spread (much cheaper than Nutella) to mix the ice cream wafers and the hazelnuts - and she's right - you do have to get in there with your hands to get it all together!I rolled them into little balls and refrigerated them.  The trick with the rolling was to wash my hands every 5 balls or so in very cold water, and then the stuff didn't stick too much!I used Lidl's milk chocolate, and melted it in a bowl over a pan of hot water, and then just rolled them in it.  The impaling on a cocktail stick idea didn't work for me as they weren't hard enough to stay on the stick - the act of impaling started to push them apart!Then, once coated, I put them on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, as you can see above, and popped them back in the fridge overnight.The YFG has easily eaten 5 or 6 of them since last night, some before they received their chocolate coating, and says they are lovely.  Costs to me:75g pack of Askeys ice cream wafers - 58p (Tesco)100g chopped roasted hazelnuts - £1.49 (Tesco)300g chocolate hazelnut spread - £1.11 (from a 400g jar at Tesco)200g milk chocolate - 70p (2 x 35p bars from Lidl)Didn't bother with the petits fours cases.So, £3.88 spent, and 32 chocolates made, at a cost of about 12p each.  Heaps cheaper than the real thing!The price for the real thing this morning is - a box of 16 for £4 or a tray of 24 for £6. I think I have found something else to make for people at Christmas alongside the fudge, and having had a trial run, I think they may be popular.  This batch are being shared between the family and the ladies at the chapel craft club this morning."},

I don't know much about the Royal British Legion beyond the Festival of Remembrance and the Poppy parades, so it was good to find out a bit more, and to spend some time with them.  The meeting opened with the \"At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them\" speech, which we all stood for.  They basically do a lot of excellent fundraising in the local area to support the work of the RBL. The meal was a bit limited for me, but that didn't matter as I have eaten since I have returned home.  The auction was fun and I came home with a jar of freshly made (this morning!) plum jam for £1, a beautiful cyclamen plant (£2), some chocolate teacakes [for the YFG] for £1, and some leftover apple pie for the FH for £1.  All the proceeds are going straight into the RBL funds, so it is a good cause. The ladies also very kindly gave me a bottle of wine for taking the time to go along and do the service, which was a lovely surprise."},

{"title": "Making progress", "date": "Thursday 6 September 2012", "text": "Making things has been the order of the day here.The FH went out yesterday afternoon and came home with about 2lbs of sloes, so sloe gin was on the list today.  Unfortunately, I hadn't banked on the sloes being ready this early in the season as it was October when I made it last year, so I had to go shopping for the gin first.  I combined the trip with getting some red peppers to make the sweet chilli jam which was so well received last year - I have plenty of chillies in the greenhouse again. The sloes have been pricked and are in the bottles of g in with the sugar and the amazing alchemy that turns sugar, gin and berries into the most delicious liqueur has begun to work.  Daily shakings for a couple of weeks, and then weekly, and we should have something drinkable for Christmas.  It is in the dark cupboard alongside the home made vanilla essence [that is in vodka - people will think I am an alcoholic!].All the ingredients have been brought together for the sweet chilli jam, so that is on the agenda for tomorrow.  There wasn't really time or energy for that today.  Luckily, I have just been given a wee collection of small jars which, once filled with the chilli jam, will make excellent gifts.I also did some bed making today - our sheets and those of the EFG have been whipped off the beds, washed and dried in the lovely sunshine we have enjoyed again today, and they are now back on the beds, smelling so fresh and clean.  It has to be one of my favourite smells - no need for fabric conditioner here!  I will do the YFG's at the weekend.And the girls?  They have both come home happily from school.  The EFG has her timetable, and actually there are only a few study periods over the fortnight, I think, so she has plenty of lessons to keep her occupied.  Textbooks and homework have already been dished out, so she has been doing some maths tonight.  The YFG has found out that they will be studying Pride & Prejudice this term, and has had to gather information about Jane Austen, so that has occupied her this evening.  She has also been given an invitation to go away for the weekend camping with her best friend's family.  They took her away last year and promised to go again this summer but what with the weather and other things, they just haven't been; this weekend looks like we are going to have some fab weather, so they are planning to escape to the coast tomorrow after school.  She is packing her bag tonight, ready to be picked up at 4.30pm tomorrow.It has been an interesting day without them, but actually we got on with things and didn't have time to miss them...yet.  This evening, we have watched David Weir triumph again to win a third gold medal in the wheelchair racing, and the awesome Jonnie Peacock storm to victory over Alan Oliveira and Oscar Pistorius, neither of whom even got a medal!  That was an amazing race, and I really had no idea who would win, but I am so pleased that it is a British athlete.  So many of the athletes have thanked the National Lottery for helping to fund them that it has made us realise just how much funding it provides for them - we had no idea at all.  We have decided that it would be a good thing to do the Lottery more often - in the spirit of a donation to these people's achievements and in their honour.  I know that if I ever win a silly amount of money, I would give most of it away!!"},

This morning was the last lie in of the summer, as we didn't need to be anywhere, so we were pretty relaxed about getting up.  Luckily I had done the washing last night, so I could just peg it straight out when I got up and saw the sun shining beautifully.  It is typical and totally to be expected that the weather would improve just as the children are going back to school. Tomorrow morning is chapel cleaning and then gym resumes in the afternoon, and we have several new children starting so it is going to be quite full-on integrating them into the classes, as well as continuing to work with the dozen or so children who are doing a competition on the 16th of the month - not long now!On my moneysaving front, I had to take a meter reading yesterday for the energy company which we switched to recently.  They want up to date readings every so often, so I trotted out to the box, yellow key in one hand and pad and pen in the other, and wrote down the reading.  Back in front of the computer, I logged on to the website and readied myself to enter the figures.  Slight problem.  The computer reckoned that a meter reader had been round on the 17th August and his reading was higher than the one I was trying to enter, so it wouldn't let me use mine......cue quite a wait on hold on the phone till I got through to an operator, all geared up to tell the person that the was no way the meter was read that day unless a meter reader person had scaled my back gate, all 6ft of it, etc.  I was not chuffed but really had the wind taken out of my sails by the chap saying very nonchalantly, \"Oh, it's obviously a mistake, I'll change it,\" making me wonder why they bother sending the readers round then.  So glad that I had had to read it for myself and check the website or they would have been sending me a new bill and possibly even revising my direct debit based on wrong information.  Phew!"},
{"title": "Examining the budget at the end of August", "date": "Sunday 2 September 2012", "text": "Now that we are in September, I can look back at August and see what went right and what could have gone better!We are now in the last third of the year, and possibly the most expensive for a lot of people.  We have to start [if we haven't already, of course] making preparations for a family and religious time of celebration in late December - Christmas.  I'm going to start thinking about that once the children are back at school later this week.Anyway, looking back first to what happened in August:We sold the box trailer for £1100 and I put £700 into the ISA very quickly!  The remaining balance is being kept handy for the costs involved in putting a towbar onto the Fiesta and sourcing a cheap and probably secondhand small trailer, just big enough to pick up a few pallets occasionally, or some straw bales for the chook runs.We kept the petrol/diesel budget well in check because we were at home a lot during the holidays.The food budget for the month got blown [again!] because I did some restocking from last month AND I got two deliveries from Approved Foods, so the cupboards are full again.  I feel better when I have food in the house for everyone!!  If we were to average £40 a week for the rest of the year, we'd come in on target for the year.  Somehow, I don't think that is going to happen, but it is something to shoot towards.In addition to the £700 in the ISA, I also managed to put £250 into savings.My car was serviced and MOT'd, and I had a serious bill of nearly £300 to deal with for that.The EFG finally made her concrete decision to attend the local college and I could order her bus pass - it arrived this month and my cheque for £450 was cashed.  That felt a little painful, even though it had been planned for and saved!  I have left the Travel Fund account open, so it is there to start stashing the next £450 away by next July - £45 a month would do it.And looking forward to September and beyond:I have had a letter about house insurance from a company I haven't heard of - PolicyExpert - offering house and contents insurance for only about £185 - considerably cheaper than the £250 I paid last year.  Has anyone heard of this company or used them?  I have until the end of October to sort out the house insurance, but I like to shop around a little, so I do start in September.I am having a 40th birthday party at the end of the month, so I am going to make some savings across the board in order to fund that, in addition to the sealed pot, which hasn't had as much in it since we went on holiday as I would have liked!  This is not going to be a particularly expensive party, as it won't  involve alcohol - we are holding it in the chapel, so alcohol is not allowed, and it is going to be an afternoon tea anyway.  I am going to get the invitations out early this week so that I know by the middle of the month how many I am catering for.  This will also be a fundraiser, the proceeds of which will be shared between the chapel and Macmillan cancer care.The day before the party is the Macmillan Coffee morning so that will also involve some baking - pennies will be spent on extra flour and margerine, etc in preparation for that, and I just have to keep my fingers crossed that the hens keep laying eggs for me!  I read daily on MSE how people are becoming worried about changes to benefits and price rises in all sorts of areas, but especially food, due to the strange weather we have had this year - too much rain here and too little in other areas of the world, so everything from flour, bread and wheat will be going up, alongside potatoes and dairy, it seems.  I try not to worry too much, but I am keeping my stocks at a reasonable level.  I am not hoarding hundreds of bags of flour, tea or tins of beans, though!I will be spending time at the library in town on a weekly basis as the YFG's ballet lesson has been put back by half an hour on a Saturday afternoon so I have more time to kill.  We come out of gym at 1pm, and now we have to wait until 2.15pm for ballet to even begin - I am not that happy about this change - and it runs for an hour, so I will be taking up residence in the library for some of this time.  I can use the time on my coursework, and reading, as well as looking for some new recipes and household or gardening tips.  The journey home may only take 10 minutes, but I am thinking of the diesel I would be wasting going back and forth.How is your September looking?  I am trying to anticipate the expenses and be prepared!"},

{"title": "Giveaway", "date": "Thursday 30 August 2012", "text": "I have had an interesting afternoon sorting out those bookshelves some more!  The children's titles, like Brambly Hedge, Winnie the Pooh, Wind in the Willows, Famous Five, Anne of GG, etc have been boxed up and put in the cupboard in the garage.  They are too precious to pass on, I'm afraid, but I don't need immediate access to them, so they are being stored.In the process, we moved some shelves up and down and rearranged some of the books, and I came upon this little stash of mini recipe books - they are frequently free gifts with magazines.  Quite a few are BBC ones, and there are some lovely recipes in them - I have done a little photocopying this afternoon of favourites, and the rest are for you!Comment on this post for a chance to win the bundle, and then share as you please."},
{"title": "Half a room", "date": "Wednesday 29 August 2012", "text": "Half of the room is pretty much finished - just the far end where the piano stands to do and that is not ready to be revealed quite yet!  I haven't really been here to do it today, so we have lapsed behind schedule a little.I was getting fed up of people traipsing through here, so I decided to block off the patio doors again, which also makes better use of the space.  So, against the patio door is the \"writing\" desk, which the YFG has taken over this evening to do her art homework - all about Andy Goldsworthy, apparently.  She has been happily working there for over an hour this evening, so that part of the room is a success.  The large cupboard in the corner holds files, boxes, craft stuff, stationery, etc - it is MY cupboard!  It isn't quite finished though - the FH made it quite a few years ago and I am still waiting for handles on the middle pair of doors and for the top doors to be glazed yet.  Mmmm...  He also made the computer trolley next to it, based on a design pinched from a catalogue - recycled from an old TV stand that someone gave him.  And the end panel of that desk you can see - where my mug of tea is sitting - he made that desk as well. Originally designed for the YFG's bedroom, but quite ok in here now, and useful to have at the side on the computer trolley for resting folders and books on.  I have squeezed the filing cabinet under the knee hole of this desk, as I don't sit at it in that direction.The random dress hanging from the curtain rail is there because it doesn't fit anyone any longer and is hanging there to remind me to find it a new home.  I washed the curtains so they will be rehung when they are ironed.This shows the \"library\" shelving which the FH made (he's pretty handy, eh?!) and the little chair which belongs to the YFG.  These bookshelves hold cook books, children's books, health titles, home ed stuff, novels, religious books, and magazines in magazine holders filed according to titles.  There are four sections to this shelving system here, although you can only just see the fourth.I am very pleased with the achievement here.  It perhaps says something on a feng shui level (I know very little) but the two junk/most cluttered rooms in the house are one on top of the other in this back corner of the house.  Hoping that once I finish sorting this one out, I can move on to the other.  Slowly does it, though. I have the complete works of Dickens up there though, in individual books - quite a collection - and no idea of where to re home them.This has been frugal home making at its best, because I haven't spent a penny to transform this room; any furniture or items new to this room are just transplanted here from other areas of the house, and that rug has been rolled up in the garage for quite some time since we decided not to use it in the kitchen."},
{"title": "Hopefully tomorrow...", "date": "Tuesday 28 August 2012", "text": "I am very hopeful that by tomorrow the office/dining room will be finished!  It has been a long slog, and hard work, but I am very pleased with the results so far - and I shall take some photos tomorrow when it is done! I have created the \"quiet room\" which I have been craving.  Now there are two desks in here - one for the desktop pc and one for writing at - and more space around them.  There is also a rug on the floor which the YFG has already sprawled all over this morning doing her French homework, so she obviously feels relaxed in here.  We have brought in a small chair, and I have tidied up the bookshelves so that this part of the library is a little more organised - the other half of it is under the stairs and is a project for another time!I have discovered that I have enough notebooks to supply a small school, and enough pens for them as well - we will not run out of black biros this side of Christmas, and I have all the Christmas cards I need this year!My organisation challenge is that I have paperwork for so many different areas of my life, and they all have to be stored somewhere - stuff for gymnastics, papers for school, work for the church course I am doing and of course, I am keeping all the sermons I have written.  I have brought in a small, two-drawer filing cabinet from the garage, in the hope of putting \"school\" in the bottom drawer and \"church\" in the top drawer.  Some of it has been filed tonight, but there is a lot still to be sorted. The shredder gave up the ghost after nearly filling a huge clear recycling bag which the council give us.  To be fair, it was working very hard, and perhaps it just over heated, but I will give it another go tomorrow when it will be cold, and see if it has any spark of life left in it.  The recycling lorry will come next week, and I am not sure that they will be impressed with three extra sacks as well as the bin!!It is very therapeutic though, and it has cleared no end of space.  Just a few more little bits to finish tomorrow.  It feels like a new room, and it hasn't cost me a penny - it has saved me a few with all the stuff I have \"found\"!"},

{"title": "I can't wait!", "date": "Sunday 26 August 2012", "text": "I've just found out this weekend that these wonderful people are coming back with another \"Farm\" series!  And this time, it is the Wartime Farm - I am really looking forward to this one.  I loved the Victorian Farm, although I have to admit that I didn't have time to watch the Edwardian version.  I will be watching the trailers for dates and times as keenly as the YFG has been waiting for Dr Who to resume!!The garden is producing at last, after rather a slow start.  It has been delightful tonight to pop outside and pick just enough French beans for my supper, and it was very nice this afternoon to be able to gather together a bundle of goodies to drop round to a friend's house: she got a couple of handfuls of cherry tomatoes, a cucumber, two wee courgettes, a handful of runner beans and two red peppers from the greenhouse, as well as half a dozen eggs.  She was delighted, and very appreciative.Last night, the rain here was torrential, as it was across large swathes of the countryside - I watched as the raindrops bounced off my car and wondered whether it would ever stop!  And the thunderstorms which accompanied the rain went on for several hours.  But today has been quite different, thank goodness - dry and bright most of the day.  A little chilly in the evening, and we are really noticing that the nights are drawing in now - autumn is in the air, I think.Who knows what tomorrow will hold?  The YFG is supposed to be swinging through the trees at Thetford Forest's Go Ape experience, with my cousin's husband, but unfortunately, the cousin's husband's father has been in hospital today, and so we are waiting to see whether the outing will go ahead.  I am also a little concerned that even if he is fit to be left for a few hours, the weather may not be terribly kind to the apes in the trees, and those of us walking in the woods underneath may get drenched.  You can tell my spirit of adventure is sadly lacking, I know!I hope you are able to enjoy the extra day if you are not at work tomorrow, and spend time with family and friends, as we are hoping to be able to do."},
{"title": "Homesick", "date": "Saturday 25 August 2012", "text": "I do get a little \"homesick\" for the hills and valleys of Scotland occasionally, and am able to indulge myself by watching one of the DVDs of some of the great Scottish series we have enjoyed over the last 15 or so years!  Hamish MacBeth first aired in 1995, and I remember watching it when I was pregnant in 1996 as well.  We made a trip to the west coast to stay in a caravan at the end of the world, it seemed, in a tiny hamlet called Corran, along the road from Glenelg.  We had to go over a high pass to get there, and we didn't go out too often!  We did make a trip to Plockton one day though, where Hamish MacBeth was filmed, Plockton becoming Lochdubh for the storyline.  We even came across the McCrae's old Landrover in the village car park, and couldn't resist taking a few photos - not able to share though, because that was in the days before digital!  There were three series of this, and the romantic tension between Hamish and the local reporter, Isobel Sutherland, was very entertaining - Isobel was played by Shirley Henderson, who the girls know as Moaning Myrtle in Harry Potter.  Hamish is played by the talented Robert Carlyle, although I think that the acting of this character way back then is far better than some of the other \"interesting\" ones he has done since!Monarch of the Glen ran for seven series between 2000 and 2005, and it was really my favourite - and it just seemed to get better!  The cast changed immensely over the five years, but it never lost its appeal, and I have it all on videos and DVDs.  The storyline develops over the years, as the relationships between the characters play out, and people move on. At the beginning, you would never have imagined the ghillie ending up with the second laird's mother, and the third laird appearing and marrying the shepherd(ess).  Two Thousand Acres of Sky featured Michelle Collins as a single mum who had to persuade her best (male) friend to pretend to be her husband so that they could begin a new life on an island which needed more people - she was given the opportunity to run the island B&B, and I have fond memories of this one as quite funny as well as fantastic scenery.  This one ran from 2001 to 2003 for three series.  I don't have this series on DVD (yet!) but am keeping a keen eye out for it at charity shops and car boot sales as it is horrendously expensive from retailers as it seems to be quite rare.Hope Springs ran for one summer in 2009, and it was great for the scenery, but the storyline and acting weren't that great.  I haven't got it on DVD, and include it only for completeness when thinking about the Scotland-based series I have watched in these last 15 or so years.  The storyline revolved around a group of  ex-prisoners who stole some money from one of their ex-husbands and planned to escape to Barbados and live the high life!  It all went horribly wrong and they ended up in a tiny and remote village in the Highlands called Hope Springs.  It wasn't one of Alex Kingston's best moments at all...Jason Isaacs is brilliant as the Edinburgh-based policeman-turned-private detective in Case Histories.  Again, like Shirley Henderson, the girls know this actor from his Harry Potter persona of Lucius Malfoy, but I think he is excellent in this, and much better without all the makeup!  We have hopes of more of this coming to the BBC perhaps this year, but who knows?  Although this is the only one of the programmes not set in the Highlands and Islands, it is still great to see the historic streets of Edinburgh as the backdrop. One of my favourite DVDs to watch whilst ironing!"},
{"title": "Exam results", "date": "Friday 24 August 2012", "text": "The EFG finally received her GCSE exam results yesterday morning.  We went over to the school, where she was given her big brown envelope, and she opened it up there and then....The news is good! 7 at A grade: Maths, English Language and English Literature, Physics, Statistics, Art, Religious Education; 2 at A* grade: Biology and Chemistry; and a B in French.  Then she also achieved three Distinctions in her ICT.She is now planning to go on and do AS levels in Biology, Chemistry, Maths and English Literature, with a view to doing the second year exams at A level in the first three.  Science is definitely on the cards.So, I am a very proud mum - she worked incredibly hard and deserved good results, as every student who works hard does - they can only do their best, and whatever their best gets them is something to be proud of.  [I don't think that is terribly good English, but you know what I mean!]"},
{"title": "French stick recipe", "date": "Thursday 23 August 2012", "text": "The ingredients needed for this are:300ml water [I use cold]1.5 tsp salt2tbsp milk powder2tbsp oil1tbsp sugar1lb 2oz bread flour [strong flour]2 tsp yeast [I use Dove's Farm quick yeast]This is the water in the bottom and then all the other ingredients added in the order they are listed above.  Then I put the bread machine on for the \"Dough\" cycle and leave it to do its thing for 90 minutes.After 90 minutes, it has risen and looks like this.I try to get every scrap of dough out of the pan with a spatula, and then I knead it on a floured surface, before dividing it into two equal pieces.Each piece is then kneaded a tiny bit more and rolled out to about 10\" by 3\" or as near as I can get it!I fold the top third down to the middle, then the bottom third up over it, and then turn it over so that the seam is at the bottom of the dough.Each piece is carefully laid in the baking tin with the right side uppermost, and at this point it has to rise again.  Sometimes I leave it out on the counter, covered with a tea towel, and it rises over about 45 minutes to an hour.  Other times, I pop it in the fridge overnight [about 7 or 8 hours] and it rises more slowly.This is what this batch looked like after a chilly night in the fridge!I then baked it at 200C for about 20 minutes, but check your own oven as it may cook more quickly or slower than mine.  Just for the last few minutes, I turn the sticks upside down so that the bobbly part is uppermost.When it comes out of the oven, I wrap each stick separately in a tea towel and then cover both with another one [this one IS clean, just tea-stained, sorry!!].  This makes the bread reabsorb some of the steam so that the crust is softened a little.And that is my French stick tutorial - I hope you try it out.The French stick baking tin came from Amazon but it has more than doubled in price since I bought mine in November 2007 for £3.30!! I first used this recipe when it was shared on the Old Style Forum at MSE, by a poster called D&DD, I think.  I have her to thank for many years of using this recipe for my family and friends to enjoy!I have had an interesting chat with the EFG over the washing up tonight so I thought I would share our musings whilst all the photos load for the French stick post on the laptop.The EFG has noticed that we have acquaintances who drink, sometimes quite a lot.  She can't understand why they feel the need!  Neither can I, but then I was talking to her about some of the other things that they do, and whilst this might seem like we were having a bitching session, we weren't.  The outcome of the conversation was education for her, and helped me to realise what a mature young lady she has become.People whose lives aren't perfect [whose is?] perhaps feel the need to escape from everyday life, and I hear that in the comments that one lady makes about needing \"a night off\" or to \"let her hair down\".  The EFG asked me why I didn't go to an evening with these ladies when I was invited several months ago, and I told her that I didn't want to go to get drunk, and that it would be uncomfortable to spend the evening with them when they were drinking beer and cider, when I would be drinking tea or lemonade.  I am not happy in that sort of environment at all, not when the sole purpose of the evening is to get drunk, it seems.Several of the ladies leave their small children with other people, which I can totally understand on one level.  When I needed to go to the doctor's, for example, or the dentist, perhaps, I would also take advantage of a friend's offer to watch my young children when it would be awkward to take them along with me.  I looked after my friend's youngsters in those years when she needed to go somewhere too - it was a reciprocal arrangement which suited both of us.  But these ladies are doing it all the time, to get a break from their own children, and that I don't understand.  At my end of the childrearing timeline, I am realising that my time with my children is all too short, and I regret any time spent apart from them!!One of the EFG's friends has been left at home for the weekend with his father, who works shifts locally. His mother has gone away for a few days, and the friend himself doesn't seem too bothered about his mother's absence, but he does seem lacking in company, whilst his father is either asleep or at work.  This has bothered the EFG badly tonight, probably more than it bothers the lad himself, and she has said to me, \"You wouldn't do that to us, would you?\" Perhaps it is because she has been used to a near constant presence.  I'm not saying that this is wrong, but it is different from what our family is used to, and it has revealed to me how the EFG feels about me being available to her at home.  She obviously appreciates that.These days, it seems that people's expectations in life are different, and not altogether realistic, I believe.  We seem to have raised a generation of people who need rewarding for getting through everyday life, for managing the ups and downs of daily activities, and who need to escape from the reality which is life.  The L'Oreal catchphrase from the adverts, \"Because you're worth it\" seems to have become a mantra in today's straightened times for justifying expenses which are not necessary.  And herein appears to me to lay a way into debt.  Families who need constant treats to get through daily life are not, in my mind, being realistic about life.  Temptations to pay for these treats and rewards on credit must be huge! Staying out of debt, or getting out of debt, does require a strong mind, and a determined one.  Ilona at Life after Money and Frugal Queen are both fine examples of this - and we could all take leaves out of their books.  I think that they are up there with Amy Dacyzycyn in the black belt of frugality, and I am a long way behind them, but I am heading in the right direction most of the time....Amy D shares a story about treats in one of her books: she takes her children to the mall because they have to pick up one gift for someone's birthday [yard sale season hasn't got going yet and she needs to buy one gift for one of her six children] so to distract the six children whilst her husband sneaks off to the car with the gift, she takes them into an ice cream shop and buys them all what she calls \"junior cones\" which sound pretty basic.  The children are thrilled with them and sit and eat them in silence, really appreciating them.  She believes that most parents would notice how much the children enjoy the cones and buy them more often, thereby reducing the impact on the children, and then the parents would have to buy more and more elaborate ice creams to keep the kids satisfied.  Amy recommends keeping plenty of \"space\" around treats so that they are recognisable as treats and not everyday events.  I think she has wise words to share there."},

I have been stuck for what to write...the first thing that came to mind, as it's my sister's 16th birthday today, I thought \"Ah, I'll write about us\". My sister and I don't always get along, as you would expect of two siblings, however, when, and I mean WHEN we do get along, we really do get along!!! I love her to pieces and miss her every time she goes for a sleepover, goes out, or even when she's in her room doing what she does best...watching YouTube or is on a social networking site. When we both get something new, the same, (recently we got a Nintendo 3Ds each) we can't help but play on them together. We share the games that we own and play two player on some of them. As we are in the summer holidays, most days we have been stuck for things to do. Most of the time one of us has said \"Do you want to watch a film?\". And then we end up watching one upstairs. But now we are running out of films to watch! When my sister is way to busy to be with me if she is doing her homework or anything else she may be busy doing, there are times when I think to myself \"I REALLY WANT A DOG\". Dogs can be great company. I've always wanted a dog, however I have always been afraid of other peoples dogs. Some are okay as I have got use to them. Me getting a dog will never happen as my dad can't stand dogs around the house. This really upsets me. My mum really wants a greyhound. If we were to get one, then I'd much prefer a Border Collie or a Labrador. When I sit alone dreaming of a dog to have as my own, but then realise that it will never happen, it just makes me want to cry as that is a dream of mine that can't come true at the moment. When my sister is busy, I could be busy too, taking it for walks with my best friend down the road who has a gorgeous Border Collie. Or even playing with him/her in the garden. We only have a cat. She isn't much company as she isn't the cuddly type! She can get quite vicious! You really don't want to get on the wrong side of her when she's in a hissy!!!! My sister most definitely tops a dog or the cat! (Although I really DO want a doggy). There has been days where I have done something to upset her and she has been in a mood all day long. I really don't know how she does it. When she upsets me, I try to be in a mood to show her that I can do it too, but I end up forgiving her and then I feel as if I have failed at trying to show her that she isn't the only one who can get a little grumpy.   What I am trying to say is I really really love my sister and I want her to know that...I know she already knows, but I wanted to show her in a way that meant something!!! When my family read this, I want my dad to realise what a dog would mean to me, I want my mum to see how much my sister means to me, and I want my sister to realise that she is a really big part of my life! :) Love YFG xxxx"},

The service went well, judging by the comments from the congregation as they were leaving.  They were all very kind and supportive, but it is a much larger building than I am used to and I had to wear a clip-on microphone - I was very glad of the co-operation of the sound person who very sympathetically turned it off each time we sang a hymn as the congregation really did not need to be subjected to my singing!!  By the end of the service, I could feel the perspiration on my forehead, and felt as if I was wilting a little. The training at the gym was similarly hot and hard work as well - we had to train for 30 minutes and then rest for 15 as it was so warm and the children were becoming fatigued quickly, which can be dangerous.  It was a good training session in many ways, though, and I am glad we gave the children the opportunity.The EFG had a day in London yesterday at \"Summer in the City\" which was a \"gathering\" of fans who watch Youtube videos of Vloggers - people who keep video diaries on Youtube, I believe.  The EFG follows several in particular, and was hoping that they would be there - and apparently a couple of them were, so she was very pleased and also enjoyed the interactions with fellow fans.  The FH was concerned about where she was going and asked if the police would be there, to which she replied that it wasn't a rave or a riot, but he still seemed to think that the police should attend....after I explained that her friend's mother was taking them and would scout the venue before she left them there for a couple of hours, he seemed to accept it.  She will be 16 this week, and it is beyond the time she needs to become a little more independent, but his age and lack of up to date experience of teenagers means that he worries more than perhaps is necessary, although I can't say I blame him.  She has just announced that she is hoping to go to a Harry Potter convention in London next year - she had better start saving some pennies towards all this gadding around.And so tonight I have had a shower, had a rest and a chat with a neighbour, eaten some easily prepared supper and now I am just longing for a cup of tea and maybe I will do a couple of rows of my knitting.  Tomorrow is another day..."},

The holiday club at gym has been going well, although it is rather full-on to be doing 4 hours a day every day!  The YFG is training for a competition, so she is working hard - she comes home every afternoon and flops out to watch a film!  The EFG is helping to coach and is doing really well with a group of little girls - she is making a plan each day and following through, so I am proud of her.  She wants to go on and do the first level of coaching courses, so now that she is about to tun 16 next week, I can book her on to one.The weather is forecast to get hot this weekend, so we will have to be prepared - unfortunately, the gazebo blew down and destroyed itself into a heap of mangled aluminium in the heavy wind we had here on Wednesday, so we don't have anywhere to sit outside in the shade now.  Plan B will be to sit close to the workshop in its shade while we can, and then retreat to the north facing sitting room, I think!"},
{"title": "Do people have time?", "date": "Wednesday 15 August 2012", "text": "Being frugal, or careful, with money and resources takes time.  It takes time to do the things we do, but it also takes time to learn how to do them, and which practices are worth taking up regularly.The friend I posted about yesterday would be better off if she could take some frugal practices on board and  \"cut her cloth\" as my granny would have said.  I have been thinking about her long and hard today, and whilst I accept and understand that she is terribly worried about the situation she is in, and what will happen next, there has to be a point at which one decides to survive and get through this.  I don't think she has got there yet as she still seems to be desperately looking for a solution to her problems, or a person to remove her from the situation.  As some wise person said, we have to accept the \"now\" before we can move on to the future.I can think of a few strategies I would be employing in her situation:Cooking from scratch - making everything myself and buying absolutely nothing rubbishy at all.  The food money needs to be spent on good quality nutrition, not junk.  Make and take sandwiches when going out, take a drink in a bottle, be prepared.  Learn to bake.Make the most of the resources on the internet.Record every penny which is spent to track spending and help to cut out unnecessary spending.Buy non-branded foods at the shops, and experiment with new ways of cooking and preparing foods - less meat and veg meals, more casseroles, stir fries etc where portion sizes are more fluid.Menu planning and thinking ahead.Complete moratorium on non-essential spending.  Complete.  No questions.Checking household utilities for cheaper options.  Cancelling subscriptions to services like Sky etc if at all possible.  Making the house or the place you live as energy efficient as possible.Walk everywhere that you can - no taxis.  Get the bus if you must.  Living in a town, unless it is chucking down the rain, it is usually possible to walk most places if you give yourself enough time.Restrict water use - more showers than baths, only using the washing machine when full, etc.Making sure that all the benefits I might be entitled to are claimed.Finding out about all the things I can do which are free - the library, for books to read, for example; any free kids activities in the holidays.  Organise a kids get together at home with home made food to minimise expenses when they socialise.Get the children on board if they are old enough to understand.  Key point to avoid problems if the children have a tendency to whine for things.  That's just the start, but I think that the people who are prepared and who live this way in the long term have a bigger cushion for when tragedy or disaster strike - a cushion of savings, of knowledge or of experience - they are all very valuable.  It is easier to keep life on an even keel for the children if the way of life does not swing up and down with the family's economic situation - there is no point giving the children a huge hike in pocket money because Mum got a promotion if pocket money has to be scrapped altogether when Dad gets made redundant, for example.Enough for one day - we have had a good day at the gym, and the girls have both had haircuts and are thrilled with their new looks!  The mirrors will be worn out by the end of the week..."},

Late afternoon one of her best friends came round for tea, and they went off for a bike ride together whilst I made her favourite lasagne followed by chocolate self-saucing pudding.  After they had eaten that, they went outside again, and played board games and Nintendos under the gazebo until 9.30pm when we walked her friend home.She says she has had a lovely day, and she is also looking forward to the left over lasagne for her lunch tomorrow!"},

I explained that although the cardiac consultant had told the GP to refer the FH for his foot to a rheumatologist, the GP had refused to do so on two occasions, and now what should we do?  The sister told me to take the FH to the local A&E, where they would be able to give him stronger pain relief, and would have access to specialist departments, and could call them for advice if necessary over his medication.So I did.  The FH made noises about the amount of time we had to wait to be seen initially (60 minutes), the length of time we waited for an x-ray (90 minutes) and the wait for the doctor again after the x-ray (about another 60 minutes), and then for the codeine to be dispensed (30 minutes)  BUT we had success overall - codeine for the pain, fluid aspirated from the ankle, which has relieved a little of the pain, and the fluid is going to be analysed - AND the consultant has promised to refer the FH to the rheumatologist because the GP won't.  Hallelujah!"},

I managed to sleep through the alarm after all that waking and dozing in the night, and woke up at 10.45am this morning!  Not good, and the poor chooks were quite ready for their breakfast when I dashed out there to give it to them minutes after leaping out of bed.Apparently, he wasn't showering in the middle of the night, but spraying cold water onto his foot as he said it had swollen up under the bandage and become very hot.  Then he did have a shower early this morning, but also ran the cold water on the feet again. He got up shortly after I did, and he has had some cold massage gel rubbed onto the worst area of his worst foot, and he is resting them both whilst watching more sport.  Have to say that the spare mattress on the EFG's floor is looking more and more attractive!"},
{"title": "Fishing around", "date": "Friday 3 August 2012", "text": "I went to that shop I'm not keen on, and did the business with the vouchers.  This is the little haul I chose to use the Frozen Food £10voucher which cost me a £5 Clubcard voucher.I knew that our freezer had no fish left in it, so that was my priority.  The two boxes of Cod in batter at the back should have been £3 each, but then there was an offer to get two boxes for £5, so that seemed to be a good place to start.  But I can't eat that, with the batter, so I also chose some plain white fish, which is cheap and cheerful at £1.75 a bag.Two bags of mixed veggies are always useful to have in the freezer - carrots/cauliflower/broccoli.  I can throw them in the steamer over a pan of rice or potatoes and have alongside the protein part of the meal, or I can add them to a risotto, or use in a pasta dish for a quick supper, so I was pleased to find these.And then there was the ice cream.......and that is where the £10 budget got blown!  I got 50p worth of this included and paid for the rest, I guess - it is the summer holidays and the YFG in particular is partial to an ice cream now and again.........so would the EFG be but she is being good about her healthy eating.  As a treat, £3.50 for two small tubs of ice cream isn't going to break my bank this week, so I let them find their way into the trolley!So all that came to a grand total of £14, which cost me £4 in cold hard cash.  Not too bad.As for the pet food voucher, I stocked up on tinned cat food, getting three 6-packs of chunks in gravy (her favourite) at £2.79 each, and then making up the difference with four individual cans at 47p each to reach the £10 total - we went over by 25p in order to use the whole £10.  I didn't buy dry cat food there as I know I can get it in Lidl's for 99p/kg and I couldn't find anything in this shop to better that price, so I bought the tinned stuff.  She is OK with dry cat food, but she does love the chunks in gravy too, so that little stash will last a while.Having avoided this particular shop quite well last month, I wasn't very impressed with their fruit and veg prices - the mushrooms are 12p more expensive than Lidl's, the kids reckon that the cherries aren't as nice, and the apples are more expensive too.  Walking round the shop, I noticed several things that were on offer at really good deals, and thought I would stock up, but the shelves were empty.  I was also peeved to find two shelf stacking ladies chatting on their mobile phones whilst they were stacking, so I felt that I was interrupting their conversations to ask them where something was!We'll be back in Lidl's next week, and avoiding this one for another month, until we need another major shop.  If I can manage to only go there once a month, I think I will feel better - I could feel myself getting cross with things in there, and the trolley was rather a pain to push...I can even see me going back to a once a month delivery if I can find some cheap delivery codes on the internet, rather than have to go to the shop.Rant over!  Hope you are having a pleasant evening - we have been watching the cycling and rowing today and heartily congratulate Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins on their double skulls Gold, and Victoria Pendleton on her Gold in the Keiren today. The men's team also brought home some medals, too!  Rebecca Adlington made Bronze in the 800m freestyle in the pool, and she did a cracking job to manage that against the 15 year old American Katie Ledecky who just flew through the water!   Michael Phelps added to his medal haul, and he is such a great sport in it all, so generous - I'm sure the USA is really proud of him.  Jessica Ennis is doing a great job in the first day of the Heptathlon so we hope she continues the work tomorrow.  Team GB has risen to about 4th in the medal table today, and although that is great, the athletes are showing great sportsmanship, team spirit and friendliness towards other competitors, and I am so pleased to see a world united in sport in this way."},

And the final buzz is the one I am getting from realising today that I have kept out of the shops for a whole working week.  I haven't been shopping (haven't needed to!) since last weekend, or even before that!  I have spent a little money, when the girls decided that they were desperate for tinned Heinz ravioli for lunch and I gave them some money and told them to bike to the village shop!  I have ordered something from Silversewer this week, and I have donated a small amount to the chapel, at the service on Sunday, but apart from that, my purse is no lighter - hurray!"},

{"title": "Getting to the end of the month", "date": "Monday 30 July 2012", "text": "Sitting at the computer this afternoon, I have had one eye on the diving and then gymnastics, and the other eye on working out the spending for the month, and looking at the state of the budget.  Seven twelfths of the way through the year, the budget lines are not all accurately reflecting that, as some are underspent, especially if they are for an annual payment which hasn't yet been spent, like house insurance which isn't due until October, but some are still overspent, and aren't going to be able to recover, so they are areas in which I shall have to continue to watch the spending very carefully.Grocery spend for the month has hugely benefited from the challenge I have done this month, but  it will not undo the overspending in earlier months which helped to fill the storecupboards.  This month's spend stands at just over £150, which includes the Peterborough warehouse trip and a stocking up shop from Approved Food - we now have lots of loo roll, cous cous, soup etc and i am sure it will be the later part of the autumn before I need to do another order there.Clothing spends have been high this month - I have bought the YFG's new uniform for September as she needed new trousers, shirts and polo-shirts, and we took advantage of a trip to a town where there is an Asda, where there were some good offers on clothes in the George section.  I have also had to buy the EFG a few new items for her Sixth Form wardrobe - she has had a fairly limited \"at home\" selection of clothes, but now that she will be wearing her own clothes at school, we needed to extend her range somewhat.  And then the FH needed a couple of new shirts - he is a nightmare to dress, as he frequently stains \"good\" clothes when he just \"pops\" down to the workshop and ends up doing a spot of something messy with paint or stain...I have invested £30 in buying 15 folding crates from Tesco to finish off the storage issues in our bedroom - the FH built us a new wardrobe months ago, which has four shelves above a hanging section, but we needed these crates to put items in tidily on the shelves, so I finally found some cheap ones and I spent last Sunday afternoon sorting it all out.  It is nearly finished, and I am very pleased with the progress in there.  Shame that there is no room for bookshelves!The Gift budget has had a big dip this month, but within its limits - I have ordered new games consoles for the girls (Nintendo 3DS) for their combined birthday and Christmas gifts this year.  They each have a bundle of the console and one game.  It means that I don't have to worry about finding anything else for their birthdays, and for their Christmas gifts, they understand that they will just get some trinkets in their stockings, but they are happy with that.  We have made this sort of arrangement before.I am getting a refund from Utility Warehouse since I moved my electricity account away from them and it is just over £100, so even with the payment to the new provider, I am still going to be about £40 in profit this month.  The DD has come down from £114 to £62 to start with, although I do think that it might go up a little when they have had a few meter readings.Hope your budgets are all under control!We found one of the baby hedgehogs meandering about on the lawn on Saturday afternoon, so we put it back in the nest.  The mum probably thought she could do without this interference, although she was in the nest in a ball (fast asleep?) and the other two were nowhere to be seen.  Last night, we reckon that they all moved out, as the nest is empty - we had a quick peek to see if they had all found each other again. I am sorry that she felt the need to move on, but I can totally understand it, as she obviously knew her nest had been found, and wanted to find somewhere more secure.  I am hopeful that she has found somewhere else in the garden - there are lots of nooks and crannies where she could hide safely here, under troughs and planters, henhouses or even the lavender hedge! We will be putting a small dish of cat food out for them several times this week, and hopefully they will benefit from it, although I can't be sure that the neighbourhood cats won't sniff it out as well..."},

I have had a lie down and read a book for just over an hour, and had some lunch, and now I am going to have to go and put the clean bedding down so that the girls can go back in to that house and investigate what I have been doing....whilst I move on to the next house...Tuesday just flew past with the trip out, shopping!  The grocery budget remained intact, but we hit the gardening budget fairly hard, buying a new watering can, some weed membrane and some other little bits.  The household budget also purchased rubber gloves, and paper for the printer.After fetching the EFG's friend, and finishing the shopping trip, we got home about 5pm, and then they watched some films and relaxed, whilst I pottered in the garden some more - we have put the gazebo up in the garden for some shade, so I did enjoy a cup of tea and read of a book for a while before cooking the tea for 8pm - it was too hot to eat much earlier.Yesterday the EFG and her friend were up early and off to the train station for a 9something train into Cambridge - the YFG and I dropped them off and bought their tickets.  A few texts during the day kept us up to speed on where they were and what they were doing but the focus of their day was a visit to the Cambridge University Botanic Garden where they took loads of photos and enjoyed the sun, as well as getting some shade too in the cafe, where I understand refreshments were also enjoyed!UJ was here yesterday for the last lunch of the season as the club is breaking for the whole of August with various helpers being away.  I have told the little group that the FH looks after that I will cook on the 2nd and 4th weeks, so they have to amuse themselves the other three weeks - they will be out and about with the FH to places, so they won't starve, I'm sure!Last night I did a little more gardening, planting some last dwarf/French beans, and discovering that some the FH planted earlier in the year as dwarf ones are actually climbing ones, and because of where he planted them, they have nowhere to climb...sticks will have to be inserted, perhaps.Today we are up and about early again because the FH is taking the YFG and her friend to Wicksteed Park in Kettering, her favourite place.  I have to take my car to be serviced and MOT'd, so I will be having a day at home today.  Cleaning the kitchen and cleaning out the chickens are on the agenda, and must be achieved, so no slacking here!!  The weather right now is cool and cloudy but I am pretty sure another hot day is on the cards, so best to get started early so I can relax when it is at its hottest."},

The cake tins are empty too, but I am not reminding them about that!  No time for baking yet!The tax return is still under construction, so to speak, although all the documents have been put together and it is now just a matter of writing the thing!  Hoping to get it done tomorrow.  Really hoping.The menu this week has been a bit hit and miss, largely based on what someone fishes out of the freezer each day - we had a roast chook on Sunday, Curry in a Hurry on Monday (I had a large mixed salad), last night they had a DIY type dinner - the FH and YFG went to a concert whilst the EFG and I were at gym, and they were supposed to feed themselves before they went - the FH said he wasn't hungry beforehand so didn't bother, and the YFG made herself some oven chips, but then when they got home, the FH was hungry and had to make himself a sandwich, the YFG cooked herself some rice concoction, the EFG had beans and toast and I had a couple of leftover sausages - quite a mish mash of food and far from ideal!I'm going to try to make more effort in the menu planning department next week, when I hope to have more time as this week has just been manic. Hope you are all doing well and if you have any more recipes to share for the chapel recipe book, please let me know where to find them on your blog, or send me a comment with the recipe in it.  I am looking for inspiration for Frugal Family Food ideas - which can includes cakes and bakes as well as cheaper family meals."},

{"title": "Stockpile spends", "date": "Monday 9 July 2012", "text": "I was invited to go along with a friend to Peterborough today, as she was going to two cash-n-carry/discount club warehouse type shops, and I had expressed an interest in seeing what they were like, and the quality of the goods they sell. Because of the distance involved, and the significant amount she buys each time she goes, she doesn't go that often - perhaps just three or four times a year.The invitation came last week, and I debated with myself the timing of the visit, coming in the middle of a challenge month, and came to the conclusion that I would be cutting my nose off to spite my face if I didn't go.  I actually enjoyed the experience of going shopping with someone else for a change, and slowing down!So, in the first place, where they didn't sell food, I bought new face flannels, and a couple of small gifts.  These are not from the challenge or food budget, so that was OK.The second place was the huge food warehouse - they sold an absolutely amazing variety of food - and so much ethnic food as well; Peterborough is very multi-cultural, and I had an interesting time peering at all these foods and wondering what they were, and what they might taste like.  My friend's husband is Anglo-Indian and she cooks a lot of curries, and other Indian foods, so she was able to explain some of the ingredients to me.I spent just over £30 in this shop:5kg of fresh chicken breasts for £16.49 - there were 24 breasts in the pack, and now 22 of them are safely packaged in plastic bags and nestled in 11 packages in my freezer - the other two have been eaten by the family with Curry in a Hurry sauce for their tea.  This means that four servings made from two breasts will cost about £1.40 altogether - very good value for money.3kg Dark brown sugar - £5.69 - a good price compared with the supermarkets.6 jars of Hartley's raspberry jam - £5.29 so less than a £1 a jar, when it retails for about £1.20/jar.2kg bacon for £4.49 - this is still in the fridge at the moment, but it is going to be portioned up and frozen too.Total spending £31.96 which is not coming from the challenge, of course, or that would have blown the budget completely and it would not be realistic as we are clearly not going to eat all of that in one week!!"},

{"title": "The second day", "date": "Tuesday 3 July 2012", "text": "Today has gone well on the spending front - my money is still in my purse! Dinner tonight was salad bits that the FH put together for us to eat when we got home from gymnastics: lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, baked beans, tinned fish, grated carrot, hard boiled eggs, boiled new potatoes and bits like that.  Everyone takes what they prefer, and the leftovers go back in the fridge for lunch tomorrow!The dinner tomorrow night will definitely not have potatoes with it as we have now officially run out.  I am beginning to make a shopping list which will get bought closer to the weekend - maybe on Thursday when we have to go out and about.  I know it will include some potatoes, carrots, apples, etc, as well as some cheese, but that is about it so far.I took photos of the store cupboards today but I am on the wrong computer to share them tonight - this pc is so old it doesn't have the right slots in it for the camera card.  I was thinking about old things this afternoon when I was folding towels because I realised that the two towels I bought \"for the baby\" when I was expecting the EFG are not only still in excellent condition and used weekly, but they are 16 years old now.  At a similar time, I bought some dark green secondhand towels from an Army surplus shop in Cupar, and they must be even older as they still have the soldiers' names written on them in black ink!  I bought two royal blue ones at the same time, which have developed a couple of holes, but they still do the job, so they are still in active service here too.  We don't throw things away here just because they are old, if they are still useful and usable. I do have to start moving things on a little sometime very soon - there are too many books upstairs in the spare bedroom, and some are not going to be useful to anyone, so they might just have to go to the recycling yard, but I will try to find new homes for things if I can. Tomorrow, I am looking forward to approximately 90 minutes of ME time!  The FH will be out at his lunch club, and the EFG is going to help a friend with some babysitting and decorating - she may be feeding/burping the baby or wielding a paintbrush, but she won't be here - so I will have the house to myself, and I can be quiet.  Bliss.  [I'm only whispering in case plans get changed...]"},
{"title": "Challenge day 1", "date": "Monday 2 July 2012", "text": "Success is a joy to report - I haven't spent anything today! The meals all came from the storecupboards and the freezers, and I have only been in the village to a meeting at school, so I haven't used a lot of diesel today, either.Our dinner tonight was Sticky Chicken - chicken thighs from the freezer, cooked for about 45 minutes and then coated in a gloopy mixture of tomato ketchup and golden syrup, with garlic cloves added.  This is then brushed onto the chicken and it is cooked for another 15 minutes to crisp up.  We had new potatoes [given by a friend], broccoli from the freezer [whoopsied, and I bought about 8 packs that night, so we still have lots more!], asparagus from the freezer for the FH, and carrots from Lidl.  The YFG has been and found a couple of chocolate digestive biscuits in the cupboard, but the rest of us are quite full now, thank you very much.I'm not sure what tomorrow's evening meal will be as we are always late home on Tuesdays from gymnastics, so it is likely to be either something I make in the morning and reheat, or something very quick to cook like pasta.......will report back on that one.I had a good rummage in the other two freezers today, and the bread/cake one has lots of provisions in the baked goods line, so that the girls and FH will be well provisioned in that department for at least a couple of weeks.The fruit and veg freezer is more of a conundrum: it is filled with things which we are not so keen to eat - gooseberries, rhubarb, asparagus...maybe we should call it the FH's freezer.  We are donating a couple of tubs of stewed rhubarb to the Lunch Club this week and all the old dears are getting rhubarb crumble.  They have also had gooseberry fool courtesy of this freezer! Today has been a good day, all in all: a successful meeting at school from 9-12, then a visit to a friend who has just had a baby - I was allowed a massive cuddle whilst I fed him a bottle, and then I came home and got on with some serious research on tinterweb, and to send some emails.  I've done some piano practise, hoed the garden, fed the chooks, done some washing, weeded the greenhouse, and cooked the dinner.  Just a little ironing to do tonight.Hope you are having a good day xx"},
{"title": "End of the month financial round up", "date": "Sunday 1 July 2012", "text": "I missed doing one of these at the end of May because we were on holiday, so I did a very thorough investigation today, and looked at totals, and percentages, and spending habits...The end of June marks the half way point through the year, so it is a good place to take stock and review the spending for the year so far.Having established that there is a student rail subsidy, I was able to reduce the EFG's travel fund from £2K to £1K, £900 of which is in the pot.  Only £100 still to save before September, so good going there.The first water bill of the year has just arrived, and it has meant that I could reduce that budget by £40, as it gives me a better indication of how much we are using: the last bill was an estimated one but this one has been done from a reading.We had a delivery of heating oil this month, so we have spent some of that budget, but not as much as I had thought.  I have left £300 in the budget for another top up in the winter, but having the wood burner has really made a difference to the heating costs.I have had to increase the Internet budget by a little to cope with paying an extra £5 a month for unlimited broadband instead of a metered allowance as we had exceeded the limit twice this year.  The girls appreciate being able to watch programmes on the i-player, etc as well as being able to use the internet more flexibly.  We had considered BTVision, but as a family, chose unlimited internet instead.The car insurance budget was topped up a little to cope with the £22.60 we had to pay out for the changeover of the Fh's car from the Volvo to the Fiesta - we had thought that the Fiesta, being a smaller car, would be cheaper to insure, but it turns out that it is slightly more because it is \"statistically\" more likely to be involved in an accident - but we saved on road tax on it, so it is swings and roundabouts with that one!And so there is an extra £84 clawed back from the Road tax budget!I have taken £150 out of the Holiday budget, as we had had more in there than we need.  There is still about £150 in there for the summer for the odd day out, but I also have lots of Tesco vouchers which can go towards days out/cinema trips too.  Having had our main holiday of the year, we will not be going away again as a family this year, although I know that the YFG has been invited on a camping trip with a friend's family and will need to make some contribution to that.I have added what spare money I can to the Grocery budget.  The cupboards and freezers are bursting at the seams, but we have stocked them up whilst we have had the chance with offers galore in the supermarkets, and being given produce from friends' and relatives' gardens.  But there is a challenge brewing - more on that in a minute.The Book/Gift/DVD budget is still looking very healthy but I have resisted reducing it at all yet, as the main gift giving season here is yet to come - the girls' birthdays are in August and the FH in November, and then there is Christmas of course.  The EFG has had to get some new books for the holiday work she has been set in preparation for the A level courses she is planning to start in September, so Amazon have had an order this afternoon, and CGP will get one tonight too.  If I can manage it, that budget will be reduced later in the year, as I would hope not to spend it all!  I have certainly massively cut back on the number of books I buy for myself and go to the library every couple of weeks now.  I have been looking at the books that several Great British Bake off ladies have produced - I like the look of the biscuit one in particular - but I have resisted - I will be asking for it in the library soon!All in all, we are doing OK.  We are not spending beyond our means at all, although we are not yet saving as much this year as I would have liked.  Having said that, we have bought two new cars this year at a cost of £2995, which has come from mostly from income, so I can't have it all ways. So, July is a challenge month.  The cupboards are fit to burst - we don't need toiletries, loo paper, cleaning items, stationery, etc, and we are not buying books, clothes and shoes, DVDs, gifts, or trivialities.  We have a strict £20 a week for fresh food and top ups, and the rest of the food is coming from the freezers, the cupboards and the stores.To that end, I have sorted through the meat freezer this afternoon and made a chart of everything in there, so that as I remove something, I can cross it off the list.  Having a list on the pantry cupboard in the kitchen means that I can look and meal plan the days each week and know more easily what we are having.  We also need to eat broccoli from the freezer, asparagus, green beans, pears, apples and strawberries.  I know that the girls will still want fresh apples, grapes, etc for lunchboxes, but that is what the £20 is for, along with cheese, bacon etc.I enjoy these challenges, and I love the accountability which the blog gives me, so I hope the budget will thank me when I look at the figures at the end of the month!"},

{"title": "Searching for peace", "date": "Saturday 30 June 2012", "text": "Not world peace, or anything as deep and meaningful as that, but just a quiet space.  In a house full of all of us, it feels very difficult to find a space for me, in which I can be quite, read, study, think or pray.There's the bedroom - not \"my bedroom\" because it is shared, of course - I am not the Queen!  Last night is a case in point: the EFG and the FH were watching tv in the lounge, and the YFG had gone to bed, and was asleep.  I thought I would sneak off upstairs to work on some new ideas for the fundraising, and to just have some thinking time.  I might as well have announced to the world that I was off, for within 5 minutes, they had both joined me, and were now watching tv in the bedroom.  The FH was in bed, and the EFG was sprawled across the foot of the bed, and they were making comments on the programme they were enjoying.    All thoughts of thinking (yes, that is a pun!) had gone out of the window, and I huffed and puffed a little, made a comment about going to sleep being easier at Paddington Station, and settled myself on the edge of the bed and went to sleep.  I do go to sleep easily, I know.I had a conversation this morning with the FH about this, and he said he needs to have the tv on for a little whilst he settles himself for sleep.  Mmmm.  I am wary of making too much fuss about the tv because I am very conscious that at his age and with his medical problems, he does need relaxation, and watching tv constitutes his relaxation - he doesn't read, and anything else he does involves activity, like gardening, which he isn't always up to doing.  He CAN read, by the way - but he won't read fiction, and seems to find reading a chore, so I don't push it, but I do buy him books for his birthday/Christmas sometimes about railways, people like Fred Dibnah, or the British coastline/countryside, which he will dip into occasionally.And the lounge is a busy place, most of the time.  There's a tv in there, which is in use most evenings, if not for the tv then for the Wii, or to watch a DVD.  The FH and the girls also use the laptops in the lounge, sometimes, and they pop in and out if they are doing something elsewhere.The little room which was a dining room once, and might have been an office for a while, and is now rather scruffy and cluttered, has a computer in - the one I am on now - but there is no real desk space, no room for a comfy chair, and the piano is in here - so folk pop in for a go on the piano now and again, or to perch on the piano stool whilst they chat.......I think \"A room of one's own\" [as Virginia Woolf called it] is required!  Not sure where to find one of those, though, and I have no room in the garden at the moment, or I would acquire a cheap caravan!  I sort of miss having the motorhome parked in the garden, as I did disappear into that a few times, which is what made me think of a caravan, but I imagine that might be quite chilly in the winter.Some days, I long for everyone to go out and leave me alone!!  I am not a terribly sociable person, and I am very happy to be left in my own company for hours at a time - I don't pine for people around me, although I am always pleased to see them on their return."},
{"title": "The verdict...", "date": "Friday 29 June 2012", "text": "They certainly did like the vinegar cake - I sliced it into eight equal portions so that there were two pieces each for them and they have eaten it all!  The FH says that they really enjoyed their afternoon, and spent time sharing memories and telling stories, as older chaps are wont to do.  I think they will be looking forward to getting together again in a week or two.  I shall have to think of a different cake for them.I'll be back posting again tomorrow - I hope you are all enjoying this glorious sunshine that we have had lately, but I have been thinking particularly about those who have suffered the horrendous floods this week."},
{"title": "Vinegar cake update", "date": "Thursday 28 June 2012", "text": "I made the cake this morning, and it looks great - the proof will be in the eating tomorrow, though!  I cooked it in a sandwich tin, and it isn't a very deep cake.I made a couple of adjustments to the recipe - I realised that there were no spices in the cake recipe, and to me a fruit cake without mixed spice or cinnamon just doesn't smell right, so I added some!  I do appreciate that this was from rationing times, so perhaps they were in short supply back then, but I have plenty in the baking cupboard so it wasn't a problem to me to add some in.  The smell whilst it was baking was well worth it!The other slight change was that I used just raisins because I had a pack that needed using, rather than using mixed fruit.  Because I thought that perhaps the raisins could do with some company in there, so to speak, I chucked in half a dozen chopped up cherries too.Once it was out of the oven, in about 45 minutes, I glazed it over with some runny honey, and it looks good. The chaps will eat it tomorrow afternoon, and hopefully they will approve - fingers crossed xxThe FH is planning to go to see one of his older friends tomorrow afternoon - he is going to pick up two other older gentlemen and they are all going to the house of the fourth for afternoon tea, and a cake which I have been asked to provide.So, what kind of cake do older gentlemen like?  The FH has suggested a sponge, but I have to admit that I am leaning towards a fruit cake, and I have found a new recipe I would like to try on one of the blogs in the blogroll.  Rationing Revisited has posted a fruit cake made with vinegar, and I am curious to try this....I am encouraged that the FH is planning this and he has been facilitating more outings for these friends - none  of them have transport and rely on others to take them out and about.  I think it will be beneficial for the FH as much as it will be for them!  He brought them to the Strawberry Tea at the chapel on Saturday and they had a wonderful time and really enjoyed themselves - it made such a difference to their weekend!I'll let you know how the cake turns out - I have all the ingredients in stock so it will be just a matter of baking it this morning.  I have a busy afternoon/evening - an appointment with the EFG an hour south of here at 4pm, a meeting for school from 6-8pm, then the EFG's art exhibition (I'll catch the last half hour), and finally picking up the YFG on her return from a trip to London today - she is going to see \"The Woman in Black\" with the drama department - they are due back about 9pm, apparently.  We saw the film sometime ago, and the play looks scary!"},
{"title": "Curry report", "date": "Tuesday 26 June 2012", "text": "Quick post to let you know that the family tried the first batch of Elaine's Curry in a Hurry recipe sauce last night.  I popped some frozen Quorn in the pan, with a little oil, added some chopped pepper that needed using up, and then added some defrosted sauce and some boiling water.  Some rice cooked in a saucepan alongside and within about 20 minutes, supper was on the table. The feedback I got was that the girls liked it but that the FH thought it could take a little more kick, but since it was the first time they had tried it properly, I was pleased with how easy it was to use, and I can think about spicing it up a bit more for the FH by using some of the additions which are suggested in Elaine's original post."},
{"title": "A drive in the Fens", "date": "Monday 25 June 2012", "text": "I have been to the far north of the circuit tonight for a preachers' meeting, and I have had the most lovely evening - the drive there was through the fields and the roads were lined with hedgerows, so I saw a few pheasants peeping through, and some kind of bird of prey, perhaps a small hawk, at the side of the road, attacking some carrion.  It was very brave, or else just dedicated to its meal, as it didn't flinch as the car passed within inches of it. The meeting passed very calmly and reflectively, with prayers and devotions at the beginning, and then the business of the meeting.  The chairman of the meeting was one of the circuit ministers, but not one I have ever seen lead a service or a meeting before, and it was moving how he spoke and prayed for some preachers who have recently died.  I would like to attend some of his services before he retires next summer.The ride home was beautiful.  The part of the Fens I went to is quite picturesque, and I half wished we lived up there - I passed by houses with orchards, where sheep are grazing under the trees, wee veg plots by the side of the road, and more than a few cheeky brown rabbits nibbling on a front lawn.  The biggest treats were saved for me, though, when I was nearly home, when a fox crossed the road in front of me and leaped into a ditch, and not half a mile farther on, I saw the glorious sight of a barn owl swooping along, following the line of a ditch. I have had an amazing night, with great company, and wonderful views and sights - and all completely free!  How blessed have I been tonight?!"},

Tonight we have had a church meeting and discussed how we are going to start raising this £600 a month.  We agree that it is going to be a challenge, and we are going to do our best to get somewhere towards the target.  An event a month is going to have to be the aim, and we are going to have to work hard to do that.I would like to compile a little recipe booklet which we can sell at local events as well as selling online as an e-book, so I am going to start thinking about an angle to theme the recipes on and what to call it.  If YOU have any recipes you would allow me to include, I would be very grateful, and I would be glad to include the web address of your blog, if you have one, as well as your name as contributor.  All ideas on themes also welcome - if you are a cookbook freak like me, what sort of cook books appeal to you?  For me, it is a toss up between a good cake and bake book, and a collection of cheap family meals for everyday."},

The FH came to church in the morning with us, but then he went to an Open Farm Sunday event in the village and followed that up immediately with a beekeeping group meeting, and landed safely back at home by about 4.30pm, quite exhausted!  So tired was he, in fact, that he retired to bed by 6pm, and declared himself too tired to eat, and went to sleep.  He's still asleep this morning.....he admitted last night that he thought he had done too much yesterday and ought to pace himself better.  Mmmm.The EFG is on the home straight now with her exams - just Statistics today and Maths tomorrow - and then she is free, pretty much, until the 30th August.  Results day is 23rd August, and on that day's news hangs her immediate future, so we have to be sure to keep the day free to go to school for the results and then to arrange whatever needs arranging!  She has signed up for a free trip in July with her current school to go to the University of East Anglia in Norwich to have a look around and learn more about what university can offer.  I think she is already pretty determined in her plan to go to university to study science, but perhaps that will motivate her further, or help her to refine her ideas.I've got my check up at the dentist this morning, so I am off to do a little housework before then.  It is raining here so it's a good opportunity to catch up with some hoovering and tidying, again!"},

{"title": "Costing out the curry", "date": "Friday 15 June 2012", "text": "Looking at the curry base recipe I made successfully last night, I have estimated it cost me about 16p a portion.  Here's how I worked that out:2lb onions [bought a 5kg bag from Lidl for £1.99] - 40p4cm piece of ginger - 9p [Tesco]6 cloves of garlic - 22p  [Lidl]3 green chillis - 27p  [Lidl]1 tin chopped tomatoes - 31p [Lidl]25ml oil - 3p [Lidl]1/2 cup chopped coriander - 35p [used half of a live plant from Tesco]1 tsp salt - 2p [App Foods]Spices: ground coriander, ground cumin, turneric, garam masala - bought large bags and used small amounts so I am allowing 31p for spices, but this is probably an over-estimate - but it rounds the total nicely!The original recipes suggests that it will make 20 portions, so that would be an excellent 10p a portion, but I have packaged it in existing tubs I had, and it has provided me with 4 tubs.  I know that 3 people will eat each tub, so that makes 12 basic portions at this stage.  I don't know whether there would be leftovers so I am not going to bank on those just yet, but that would increase the number of portions.The other benefit of this is that I know exactly what is in the sauce; no hydrogenated anything, no fancy preservatives, only honest basic foods and spices.  The FH tasted it last night and his comment was, \"That tastes Good!\" so I take that as a positive sign.  I think that curry will be on the menu this weekend so that the guys can test it out.Costing this out proves that in the long run it compares very favourably with any bought sauce - the cheapest jar in Tesco is their own \"discount\" brand at 79p a jar. I have enough of everything else bar chillis to make another batch or even two, so I will be picking up more chillis somewhere today, and then I will be making more over the weekend.  It makes sense, whilst I have the fresh garlic and coriander and ginger.  I love the way that this base can be used to make different kinds of curries just by varying the ingredients that are added when the final dish is cooked - take a look at the original blog entries to see some of the variations."},

{"title": "Monday musings", "date": "Monday 11 June 2012", "text": "Not a lot to report today - a fairly run of the mill kind of Monday!  I did so much washing at the weekend that it took me all morning to do the ironing, and now I have to pack it all away into the airing cupboard tonight....not my favourite job at all. This afternoon the YFG had an extra piano lesson, as she is taking her grade 1 exam next week.  She's doing OK but she'll have to keep practising hard.  The EFG went to school for a maths lesson today, and will go for the morning tomorrow.Tonight I have had a blitz on the room that was once the dining room, became a sort of office and then degenerated in to an untidy storage space (dumping ground!) and have removed three bags of rubbish from there - hurrah!  It isn't great yet, but it is a definite improvement on what it was before I started....I found a great new-to-me blog last night, http://mortgagefreeinthree.com/ and it is great!  Not only is the writer based in Cupar where we used to live, but she is also on a major money saving mission - and doing a fantastic job.  I am going to be trawling through it this week for new ideas and recipes.  I'll be adding her to the blogroll later.I missed doing the end of May financial review because we were on holiday but I would like to report that the holiday spending was within the budget!  The sealed pot money (about £141) covered all the entry fees to the various places we went, the ice creams and treats, the postcards, parking charges, and the gifts we brought home for our friends!  I was very pleased with all of that.  The food for the week came out of the normal grocery budget, as we ate pretty normally, and the diesel is also within the usual fuel budget.In place of the May review, I am going to do a half yearly one instead - so I hope to get that done tomorrow.  I am optimistic that it will be in line with some of the predictions, as I know that although we have spent £3K on new cars and about £1000 on the holiday, we are still just over £700 better off than we were at the beginning of the year, so we are doing something right.  I have to work hard on making some savings or I won't make the savings targets for the end of the year."},

{"title": "Bridlington holiday June 2012", "date": "Saturday 9 June 2012", "text": "BridlingtonJune 2012FridayWe lefthome at about 2.15pm, loaded to the gunnels, with everyone jammed in to thecar!  We had just about got room foreverything, but only just…Once on the road, it seemed to be that everyone elsewas on their way as well.  The trafficwas heavy all the way. We got stuck in roadworks in Wisbech before we even leftthe region, and then we hit very heavy traffic getting through Lincoln on theA15.  Lincoln took nearly an hour tonavigate, and it was bumper to bumper all the way.  We did, however, get some wonderful views ofthe Cathedral from the roadside, and the girls sat in the back of the car withcameras poised most of the way.  The Humber BridgeThrough Lincoln, we were straight up the stretch of Ermine Street to themotorway which led us to the mighty Humber Bridge.  The views there were great, and I thought ofIlona and her walks, which usually end at the bridge.  Once over the bridge, we headed for Beverley,and saw the beautiful Minster very briefly some way away.  Soon after that, we were on the road towards thecoast and Bridlington was on the signposts at last.When we found the outskirts of Bridlington we started to lookfor a supermarket.  There was no room inthe car for any provisions beyond a few snacks for the journey, really, so weneeded to get basics for the evening meal and breakfast.  I caught sight of a long low building which Ithought had a typical supermarket style roof, so I turned off the main road; wewere slightly disappointed to discover that it was in fact the DistrictHospital!  However, the road lookedpromising so we continued and found Morrison’s, and Aldi.  We chose Morrison’s and had to come to thecabin with the carrier bags packed on the laps! The cabin is tucked away in a corner of the development, andhas a lovely, quiet aspect.  There is akitchen/dining/sitting room, a lovely open plan area, with a door to thedecking at the front and a door to the hallway. We have all the mod cons we could ask for – Tv with Freeview and DVDplayer, radio/CD player, dishwasher, fridge, freezer, washing machine, electriccentral heating, etc.  The girls aresharing the front bedroom with the en-suite bathroom (shower over bath) and theFH and I have the back bedroom which has an en-suite shower room.  There is a separate cloakroom (ie toilet) aswell.  The beds are lovely, socomfortable!  Heritage Park lodgesWe cooked our meal last night and then spent the eveningunpacking and reading all the brochures in the cabin, trying to make ashortlist of things to do this week.  Wealso unpacked.SaturdayI slept amazingly well this morning, but woke at the usualtime, 6.40am, and then couldn’t get back to sleep, so I read a book and waitedfor everyone else to appear at 8am.   Ihad breakfast with the girls and then the FH managed to rouse himself by about9am for some bacon and eggs. [I tucked a box of eggs under my seat in the caras there was no way I was going to buy eggs when we have so many at home!] ThenI had a leisurely bath in the girls’ bathroom – it is a P shaped bath, andtakes an age to fill so I didn’t indulge in too much water.  The girls and I left the FH relaxing whilst we went off toBridlington to find Tesco for food and diesel. We found it, but the traffic in the middle of Bridlington this morningwas murderous – but then it was Saturday morning on a Bank Holiday weekend, soI should have expected it, I suppose.  Lunch was next on the agenda, and so we headed home.The FH had no desire to go anywhere today; I think that thejourney and the preparations over recent days had tired him out.  We went out in the afternoon and left himwatching the racing on the tv.  I tookthe girls to Flamborough Head, and we walked along the cliff tops, looking atall the birds nesting on the sides of the cliffs – I was SO excited as I saw myfirst live puffin!  Lots of photos weretaken and we really blew away the cobwebs up there.  I drew the line at climbing the lighthouse,but we bought some postcards, and I sat on the clifftop and rang my dad.At Flamborough HeadWe were too late in the day to go to the model village atBondeville in Sewerby, so we passed that for today and carried on in toBridlington’s North Promenade.  We parkedthe car and walked along the prom, seeing the sights.  A man had four donkeys on the beach, givingrides, and then the lifeguards from the RNLI were patrolling another area wherelots of children were playing in the sand and paddling, but it was ratherchilly!  We paid for a parking permit foran hour, so we walked for half an hour, then got ice creams and walked back.  We found a cinema showing “Snow White and theHuntsman” which the YFG wants to see, so that may happen later in the week,especially on a rainy day. The tide was coming in and the YFG enjoyed standingclose to the railing and feeling the spray from the sea bashing against the seawall. We noticed Bridlington’s fishing heritage celebrated on thewall along the prom where lots of fish were moulded into the bricks – cue photoopportunity for the camera operators again!North Promenade, BridlingtonWe have come back to the cabin and put all the photos on tothe laptop so we could show the FH a slideshow of where we have been and whatwe have done today.  He is asleep now,and the girls are watching Ratatouille on the tv.  They both brought some homework with them, somore of that may get done tonight, but after all the sea air I have breathedtoday, and all the walking we have done, I will not be late to bed tonight!SundaySunday got off to a slow start as we all slept in until 10am,no doubt as a result of all the glorious sea air we enjoyed on Saturday!  After slowing coming to, we had somebreakfast in a leisurely manner, and surveyed the weather.  It wasn’t good, and it seemed like an indoorkind of day was on the cards, so we went off to John Bull’s World of Rock, afew miles away.  Unfortunately, we chosethe wrong day for a tour of the factory, so had to be happy with a mooch aroundthe shop, and buying a few wee gifts for the friends back home.  We were thrilled to find it possible to buy astick of rock with “Uncle” written through it so we snapped one of those up forUJ straight away!The amazing river pageant on the Thames took up the rest ofthe afternoon and I was sort of glad that it rained here in Yorkshire so thatwe were here to watch it, as it was a really thrilling spectacle.Later on the girls went for a walk to find a postbox to sendtheir postcards and they were gone for about an hour.  We settled in for the evening after that andgenerally relaxed.MondayToday dawned as most Bank Holiday Mondays in England do – wetand dismal! It was raining when I came through to make the first hot drink ofthe morning, but then it cleared up a little and raised my hopes.  By the time we were all eating breakfast, itwas raining again, and our plans were more uncertain by the minute.  Thankfully, by 10.45am, there were blue skiesand we packed a picnic and headed out. Sewerby HallNot too far from the cabin is Sewerby Hall and Gardens,including a little zoo.  We were therefor about 4 hours, enjoying the exhibits in the Hall, the beautiful formalgardens and walled gardens, the parkland and the views of the sea.  I could have sat there watching the world goby for hours.  The girls were busy withthe cameras all day, taking lots and lots of gorgeous snaps.  Gateway to the courtyard and The Town Crier - a local actorInside the house is a historical exhibition covering all sortsof things – the history of the farm lad in the East Riding of Yorkshire, thechap who invented the bouncing bomb, lots of stuff about the airships, and afascinating exhibition of Amy Johnson and her Gypsy Moth. Beautiful walled garden at SewerbyThe Council own and run the house now, and when they took itover from the Graeme family in the 30s, she came and opened it in 1936, just afew years after she completed her 19 day flight to Australia in Gypsy Moth –how inspiring!Formal gardens at SewerbyHome beckoned for a while, and we enjoyed soaking up a littleof the sunshine this afternoon sitting on the decking with our readingbooks/homework/revision, before the FH took the girls off to get fish and chipsfor their tea.  Tonight we are watching the Diamond Jubilee Concert in frontof Buckingham Palace.  The FH is not thatkeen, and keeps making derisive comments about the singers, but the EFG, YFGand I are enjoying it.  He will enjoy themarching and pomp of the ceremonies tomorrow morning as the Queen attends StPaul’s Cathedral for her thanksgiving service, so he will have his timethen.  We still have some wet weather activities up our sleeve, butwe are hoping that we do get some more sunshine before the end of theweek.  We are almost half way through theweek and it is relaxing and I am enjoying being away from the phone, theinternet and the demands of normal life!TuesdayWe have been to the Bondeville Model Village today; at least,the EFG, YFG and I have been out.  The FHis having an at-home day today after all that went on yesterday – he isn’t upto a cracking pace and has to take things one step at a time.  Valentine Abbey at Bondeville Model VillageThe model village was pleasant enough, but perhaps a littledisappointing in some ways – it looked somewhat tired, although we did love thetiny houses and staged scenes outside the hospital, the pub, the hotel and theharbour, for example. Three churches in the village, so we made sure we took note of the Methodist one! It is a brilliantconcept, but for something that took us less than 45 minutes to look around, itwas not cheap, costing £8 for the three of us. Yesterday’s trip to Sewerby House cost £14 in comparison and offered alot more and that was for four people. The girls took lots of photos to share, and you can clearly see that alot of the models would benefit from a small repair or lick of paint here andthere.  Once we had looked around there, we decided to go into thetown of Bridlington.  We parked in thestation car park and walked about half a mile or so down the road to the towncentre.  We were in the modern towncentre, not the historic old town, and it was an eye-opening walk around.  We were shocked at the number of shops whichwere boarded up, closing down or empty; Bridlington unfortunately seems to be astruggling town.  Quite how M&Smanages to stay open, I am not sure.  Thebuildings are mostly occupied by fish and chip restaurants, which of course aretestament to the fishing heritage of the town. There are some shops, but they are limited, and the charity shops havetaken over a lot of the spaces – we didn’t count them but there were plenty ofcharities running shops here that I had never heard of – far more than thebasic Cancer charities, Heart Foundation and Age Concern.  We walked through the little shopping mallarea, avoided a Talktalk representative, and then an O2 chap on stilts, andmooched towards the harbour.  It wasfascinating to watch some boats in dry dock areas being painted, and there werequite of lot of small boats sitting on the mud as the tide was out.  From here we could see the glorious beach ofthe South Promenade area, which looked beautiful, golden and huge!  A far larger expanse of beach than we hadseen at the north end of the town.   We sat by the Harbour and rang home but UJseemed not to be in, so I then rang my dad and had a quick chat with him.  He is going on holiday on Friday so we won’tsee him when we get home as he will already have left.The girls and I came home to the cabin and found the FH stillwatching the coverage of the Queen’s Jubilee today – the parade from theCathedral and the lunch at Westminster Hall, and then the balcony appearancelater on.  He is still resting and hashis feet up.  The girls have gone off nowon a circular walk of about 4 or 5 miles, I think, so they should be back inthe next hour or so, quite worn out!!The YFG rang to say that they were on their way back, so I setoff for a wander in the hope of meeting up with them.  The YFG rang again to say that they werelost, couldn’t access the golf course to get back to the cabin, and were on abridleway to Danes Dyke – what should they do? Knowing from the signposts where Danes Dyke is, I told them to carry onalong to the Dyke and I would meet them there in the car.  I had to hotfoot it back to get the car, anddrive off to the car park at the nature reserve which is Danes Dyke.  Once there, we had a few worrying momentswhen we were in contact on the phone but neither party knew where the otherwas!  After a while, we sortedourselves  out and met up, very relievedindeed – and thankful for mobile phones!This evening we have eaten and are now relaxing by the tv,books and knitting and the laptop at hand – no internet access but it is usefulfor typing this in Word, playing Solitaire, watching DVDs, and showingslideshows of all the day’s photos, so I am glad I brought it along.WednesdayAnother long lie in this morning, well deserved after all thewalking yesterday!  The FH was the lastto surface just after 10am.  It wasraining hard when we got up, so we didn’t rush around.  Plans for the day included the tour of therock factory and then on to a Birds of Prey and Animal Park.  On arrival at the factory, we found the tourarea closed for lunch, which dampened spirits as much as the rain, so wecontinued up the road to the animal park. This was more interesting as there was a large complex there, with acafé, bird of prey and animal centre, a big play barn/soft play centre for thewee ones, and a Factory Shop.  I had apoke round in there with the girls, firmly reminding them that anythingpurchased has to fit into the suitcases, and we found a couple of bargains.Probably the highlight of the week for the FH - a family of meerkats  Walking round the animal centre, we were thrilled to find afamily of 6 or 7 meerkats (they kept moving!) which were just gorgeous.  They looked well fed, and had a huge heap ofland where they had tunnelled down and made themselves quite at home.  \"You keep watch that way, I'll watch this lot over here!\"We hoped to watch a flying display but to start with the raincame down so heavily that we had to go indoors and just listen to the falconertalk about the birds but when the rain cleared up about 15 minutes later, heput on a fantastic flying display with a variety of birds – we really enjoyedthat.  A rare hybrid bird which flew majestically after the rainstormThe sun came out to complete the picture and we sat therequite happily watching that for about half an hour.The handler showing people the bird's beautiful plumageSince the rock factory was on the way home, we gave it onemore chance and were successful in finally getting in to see the rock andchocolate areas.  It was rather full ofpeople due to the inclement weather, so it wasn’t possible to ask any questionsor talk to the people who were so busy with other tourists, but it wasfascinating to see two men (with serious biceps!) manhandling huge pieces ofthe rock into huge rolls, and then they were put together and the regular rockwe usually see extruded.  A couple morepurchases from the factory shop and then we were on our way back to the lodge.Once home at about 3.30pm, we had lunch, and relaxed.  My hips are struggling with all the walking Ihave been doing and the ball & socket joints are causing me some pain so Ihopped in a hot bath and have had my feet up ever since in an attempt to be fitenough to walk around again tomorrow. The FH has been lucky with his ankles and even though we brought along acrutch for him, but it seems that it may be me using it before we go home if Iam not so lucky.This evening we have watched a DVD and now are enjoying ourregular fix of Lewis, although we have been disappointed to learn that it isthe last in the series!ThursdayThis morning dawned damp once more, but we didn’t let thatdeter us from a day out on the last day of the holiday.  The destination of choice was Burton AgnesHall, mid way between Bridlington and Driffield.  A slight detour got us there, and we werevery impressed with the outside of the house, and when we went inside, weweren’t disappointed.The courtyard at Burton Agnes, with plant sales, cafe and London Bus art gallery  The girls were thrilled to be able to continue theirphotographic record of the holiday, and there were loads of amazing itemswithin the house which they wanted to snap. The house was built in the first Elizabethan period, and reminded me alittle of Kentwell Hall in Suffolk.  Thefamily in which it has passed down all these years still live in part of thehouse, and are very involved in running the Trust which owns it.  Front of the house at Burton AgnesThey have also developed an inspirational walled garden, whichwe loved.  The flowers and vegetables inthe garden are much further on than we expected, and chatting with one of thegardeners, he shared that the wall keeps the garden a week or so ahead of thelocal area; even his own garden in the village is not at the same stageyet.  Having giant chess sets, draughtsboards, hopscotch and quoits within the garden just adds to the things to amusethe children.  There is also a largemaze, but I wasn’t feeling up to getting lost in that as I was walking with acrutch to support my hips as all the walking we had been doing in the past fewdays had given me some pain.  The formal water feature in the garden"},

Today hasn't been quite as busy as yesterday, but we have still made progress.  The Volvo ended up at the scrapyard this morning, coasting the last few yards up the road as the clutch actually went as we were on the approach, so that was just in the nick of time!  The smell was quite pungent...We got £130 for it, which went straight to the bank towards paying for the new-to-us Fiesta that the FH is getting on Friday. I had a little hiccup with the insurance on the Fiesta which is now sorted and the new policy has winged its way to me via email so that I can tax it when I get the MOT certificate tomorrow. Whilst we were in town at the scrapyard, I went and did a few errands - a quick trip to the shop for some fruit and veg, the banking, and to the yarn shop.  I have been reading on Rhonda's blog at Down to Earth about knitting cleaning cloths, so I have bought some 4ply cotton yarn to make one as my holiday knitting project.  The only thing is that the cotton yarn looks awfully thin, but I have seen that some people knit with two strands of it...I might see how I go with one and then decide.This afternoon the FH fetched the EFG home from school after her English Language exam and some revision sessions were over.  I heard all about her day and then put in a call to the school to make the powers that be aware of some communication issues which had affected her today - her Statistics teacher had been off sick but they had been scheduled for a lesson/revision session, but no one had put a cover teacher in there.  Then she went to go to an allocated revision room, to find that both of them had been taken over for other lessons.  I was rather persistent with the lady who answered the phone so she put me on to the Head's PA who was very apologetic!And tonight has been the last gymnastics session for the half-term at the club as we aren't doing it at the weekend, partly because I wouldn't be there anyway but also because of repairs to the gym floor which mean that the room is not available anyway.  I just have the after school class at the village school tomorrow and then I am done until the 12th June.The weather was rather cloudy and dismal here all day until about 4pm when the sun came out and it got rather hot and sticky here - the humidity seemed to have risen sharply.  I have to say that the coolness of the morning was like a breath of fresh air, and I wasn't exactly complaining."},

Each was able to choose £50 of clothes of their own choice - tops, shorts, trousers, summer sandals, etc which they are looking forward to taking on holiday, so I have got my fingers crossed that this nice weather holds out a little longer.And it cost me?  Not one penny.  Thanks, Tesco - you have your uses, but I am still not keen on the fruit and veg you sell.  I am not going to be getting quite so many vouchers in the future now that I do more of my shopping at Lidl's.Do you look in other people's trolleys in the shops?  I do.  I was shocked this afternoon in the local Tesco where I was pootling around.  I was in the medications aisle, and a lady came along with a baby in the seat of the trolley and said to her partner/husband, \"Oh, I really need some Calpol for him,\" indicating to the baby, \"but it is so expensive!\"  Calpol is not THAT expensive, and there are generic versions available, but she walked on by without picking up a bottle from the shelf.  So what is so shocking about that?  Well, in the trolley was a large pack of beer with a label on it which said £6, I believe.  I think that most of us would have put the beer back and bought the Calpol.  I was gobsmacked.....and have to keep replaying it in my mind as I can't quite believe that what I saw happening actually really happened.  Did a family actually choose beer over medication for their child?Clicking through to the osprey webcam just a few minutes ago, I was treated to the sight of the female osprey standing on the side of the nest and the little hatchling in the bottom of the nest, with the two remaining eggs, and then the proud papa alighting on the other side of the nest and watching over them all.  The sun is shining over the Loch of the Lowes behind them and it looked very tranquil there this morning.  A beautiful start to the day!"},

Biology is on the timetable first thing this morning, and the FH has just taken her to school now at 7.35 so that she is there for 8am for a breakfast last minute revision session with the teacher.  She has done every past paper available for the course - all 16 of them - and has scored at least As for all of them, so she is reasonably confident that she can handle whatever the exam holds this morning.  Since Biology is one of her choices for A level, it is a big deal to her to do well in it.  We have wished her lots of luck this morning.The YFG has a Maths exam today in the usual end of year type exams - she has also worked hard on her revision, so we are hoping that she can just do her best and do her hard work justice.  She is rather nervous this morning, and worried that if she doesn't do well she will get moved down a maths set, but that is highly unlikely!!The garden is looking very dismal at the moment - the hens have had to be allowed to range across the grass and the veg areas, since their runs have changed into a mire of mud, and the veg areas, which should have the first shoots of growth in them at this time, are still bare earth.  The hens are helping a little, in that they are keeping the weeds down, but we are not at the stage of growth and development that we should have achieved at the middle of May!  The weather has proved very challenging this month, and we are heartened to hear that this week should bring a week of warmer weather - we hope to get seeds planted this week!  So far behind...I am challenged this morning as the \"b\" key on this laptop is not working and every time I want to type that key I have to stop the flow of typing and hit it quite hard - very annoying!  It is also making the writing a little stilted in that I am thinking as I type of words I can use to avoid words with that letter in them....sorry!On Friday, I went to an appointment with a homeopath in the local town.  I spent two hours with him explaining all my medical history - and it was a very comprehensive and thoughtful couple of hours - I thought I had thought of everything when I was preparing for the meeting, but then I seemed to come up with other things from the depths of my memory!  He came out yesterday afternoon with some remedies which I am to start taking today....hopefully, I will feel more alive and fitter in a few months' time."},

{"title": "Loving Lidl - a rediscovery!", "date": "Monday 14 May 2012", "text": "Our Lidl experience began years ago when we lived in Cupar.  There wasn't a Lidl there, but I used to take the childminded children, along with the EFG, to Silverburn Park in Leven, down the coast aways.  There was a Lidl there, and that was our discovery of the German supermarket.We travelled to Leven about once a month, and we stocked up on all our tinned and paper type goods there, filling the pantry each time.  I was feeding a lot of people back then - the three of us (prior to the YFG arriving), two minded children five days a week, and up to four lodgers at a time!!Then, after a few years, Lidl arrived in Cupar and I was set - when the YFG was born and I used the big old-fashioned pram again, I could fit two cardboard boxes on the tray underneath and walk down to Lidl to fill them with the shopping.  Fond memories.Since moving to the Fens, our use of Lidl has been spasmodic.  Up and down.  Depending on how I felt at the time!  Dissatisfied with the condition of the fruit and veg in Tesco, and with the EFG eating more proteins at the moment, I popped back into Lidl a few weeks ago.  The fruit and veg is lovely, in good condition and very satisfying prices, and there are lots of different kinds of hams, other cold meats, and some very good fresh meats available too.  I nipped into town today to Lidl, and was pleasantly surprised to come out with a trolley loaded quite well for only just over £27.  It is always better to go alone so that I spend less.I supplemented the shopping there by nipping into a bigger supermarket to pick up a couple of organic cucumbers, and that was the shopping done.  Result.What's your preferred shopping method?(Photo from telegraph.co.uk)Both of the girls have tests today - of very different magnitude!The EFG has her GCSE French Listening exam today, from 1.30pm for 35 minutes, and the YFG has an end-of-module science test at 11.15am.  We are now in the midst of the GCSE period - the exams may only just be kicking off really but the revision has been in full swing for weeks, and the folders of past papers have grown thick and dog eared!  She is working hard, and hoping for good outcomes.The YFG is only Year 8 so hers are still important to her, but not on the same level as the GCSEs.  She is taking them seriously, though, and spent yesterday afternoon with her head in a revision book, and then made herself a comprehensive set of revision notes on the laptop.  She has gone off to school with those tucked into her bag for some last minute recaps on the bus.  They have both gone to school with Good Luck wishes ringing in their ears.Just when I thought I had all the after school activities sorted out and on an even keel, the ballet teacher has asked if the YFG would like to do another class a week.  \"She's doing very well and could do the exam next March if she attended two classes,\" she said.  I replied that I would talk with the YFG about it and think about it all - we need to think about how it would fit in and the extra cost implications.  Another evening out of the house, even for a short time, has an impact, and it would involve another hour in town with nothing to do.  OK in the summer when I can sit in the car and read a book, but an hour wasted in winter when it would be cold and miserable in the car park. Time is the commodity under pressure here at the moment, and I am struggling to accommodate more activities, so there will be more talking before we decide about this.  I am veering, as you can tell, towards the \"No\" camp!"},

Over 5000 people donated a little, and the results are HUGE.  The impact of the event on the two women will be huge, and it will have a lasting effect on the lives of their families as well.I would urge you to follow this blog, perhaps follow their Facebook page, and if a mission touches you in the future, perhaps you will find it in you to donate a little next time.  Every penny counts, and all the pennies really do add up.  I made a small donation, and that was enough.  When I read of the two women for whom the appeal was being made, I thought to myself how easily either one could have been me.  I have been so blessed with healthy children, and although my own health is not robust, I am in a far better place right now than either of those two ladies.  I truly admire their strength of spirit and their dogged determination to do the best for their families - these are inspirational ladies who deserve help.I freely admit that many times when I read this lady's blog, I am crying as it is so moving.  Love really does make the world go around."},
{"title": "Errand day", "date": "Friday 11 May 2012", "text": "Some of the organisational websites like Flylady recommend that one has an \"errand day\" on which the shopping, library visits, trips to the post office and bank, etc are all accomplished at the same time.This is what Thursdays are becoming here, but not through any grand plan to follow a good idea - just because it happens like that!  The YFG and her friend need a lift on a Thursday from one town to the other for their piano lesson at 4pm - they have half an hour each and then the friend's mum brings them home at 5pm.  This leaves me free and in town at 4pm - perfect for doing things!  The YFG is being entered for her Grade 1 exam this term, so I had that to pay for (£33.50!!) as well as the lesson.So yesterday, I went armed with a list.  I bought a bag of Picasso potatoes (25kg for £5.50), picked up my glasses from the optician where a new side had been fitted because they broke (£15), collected the YFG's ballet leotard from the dancewear shop (£17.50), nipped into the library and changed my books, dashed in to the Co-op for some pitta breads for myself and then into Lidl's for food/cat food, and returned home at about 5.20pm after calling in at the shop that does embroidery on sportswear where the gym club had ordered some hoodies which were ready for collection.Now, convenient and economical as all this was to do on one day, the effect on the bank balance was dramatic - I spent £100+  in less than an hour!!  Thank goodness that the rest of the week had so far been made up entirely of No Spend Days, and I expect I shall have more this week.The other thing to say about this is that I love the way we live close to a town like this which is still vibrant and humming with activity - there aren't the greengrocers, but there are butchers, bakers, and candlestickmakers (well, a jolly good hardware/ironmonger shop!) and lots of individual shops as well as smaller chainstores like Heron Foods and Boyes, Holland & Barrett, Boots, M&Co, several independent clothes stores, including a bridalwear shop which does the most amazing window displays, and some gift shops as well as the usual banks, estate agents, and charity shops.  I did mourn the demise of a bookshop, and it wasn't for lack of my patronage that it closed as I was often in there!  Probably better for my bank balance that it did close, but nevertheless the town is slightly the worse off for it not being there any longer. If I can't buy what I want between this town and the internet, I don't need it - and I hate \"shopping\" as a recreational activity so schlepping around a big shopping centre or a big city is totally out of my comfort zone!  I will make a trip into Cambridge to the shops once every year or two, but only then because I enjoy going to the Lakeland store for a look at the new products (and sometimes I succumb!), and being fitted properly at Bravissimo, which is always worth the effort!"},

It is still green all these years later; I don't think they have changed the design at all."},

{"title": "Electrical changes", "date": "Friday 4 May 2012", "text": "(Photo courtesy of utility-exchange.co.uk)Today has been the day I finally found a few minutes to look at the electricity prices!  As we are high users according to Utility Warehouse, I knew that there might be some value in changing to another provider.Having tracked the electricity usage for 26 weeks or more, I know that our average is 130 units a week.  High, I know, so the first thing is to buy those units for less, and then to continue to work to reduce the number of units - a win, win situation.I went onto a comparison website and established which would be the cheapest deal.  I found that Scottish Power have a fixed rate deal until next June, and it is an internet only account.  Suits me.  Having inputted our usage at 52 times 130, it estimates our bill to be about £500 a year less than I am paying UW, so I will be well pleased if that turns out to be the case.  I am expecting them to set us a DD of about £70 a month.In order to make the application, I went to Quidco to see if there is a cashback offer available and sure enough, there is!  Because we only have electricity, I only qualified for that deal, but I should be getting £21 back through Quidco, which is an improvement on the £15 that the comparison site was offering.The tariff also includes a discount of £10.50 at the end of the year - it will be taken off our bill once we have been there for a year, I expect.That sounds to me like a good day's work.  Have you saved any money today?"},

A lot of us would do well to consider some of Frugal Queen's long term water saving methods.I have to weigh up two things - I said yesterday that the Grocery spend has to average about £230 a month for the rest of the year and on the other hand, I have a voucher offering a significant 12.5% off from one of the major supermarkets.The challenge then is to get the most value from that and to stock up on things we need, things we use regularly, and things that won't deteriorate for being kept for some time.If I spend £80, the voucher will get me £10 off, so I get £80 of items for just £70.  Some people would say that it is a gimmick, a trick, to get us into the supermarkets to spend money.Sometimes I would agree - every time that I go into the Co-op and no matter how much I spend, I get a coupon for £3 off a £30 shop.  But I don't usually spend that much in there, and their prices are slightly above average, although as I have said before, I do appreciate and admire their ethics.  In these economic times, though, my first thought is for my family's best value.So this morning, I am going to do my research, investigate our cupboards, look at our meal plan records, perhaps have a look at a few comparison websites, check out the freezer, and think about what we need.  If I do my part, I can get the best value out of that coupon, and make it matter.Then I will make a list, and probably even cost it on the online shopping website so that I can be sure it comes to £80 and not too many pennies more.  And will my time be well spent?  Remember for a lot of people that a tax free pound saved is worth more than an extra pound earned!"},
{"title": "What are you up to?", "date": "Tuesday 1 May 2012", "text": "Rhonda asks what we are doing today, as her day has recently begun - tomorrow for me!  So I'm going to tell you what I got up to today! 6.45am The alarm goes off and I go to make sure that the girls get up. 7am The girls and I make it downstairs and start on breakfast.  Sometimes I have to make sandwiches, sometimes they have made their own the night before.  The YFG gets her breakfast - two chocolate Weetabix with milk (the same thing, day in, day out) and I make scrambled egg or an omelette for the EFG to fit in with her diet programme.  In between doing this, I make my porridge in the microwave and go into the lounge where the dining table is.  I usually put Breakfast on and catch up on the news.7.30am I turned on the laptop and check the emails, the bank, eBay and some blogs!  Replying to the emails, checking and recording the bank balances and inputting my spending into the spreadsheets occupies about 25 minutes until the girls leave the house to catch the bus at 7.55am.  I always wave them off.At 8am I took the FH a cup of tea and went up to see how he was.  The Colchicine for his gout brought on diarrhoea yesterday and he spent the day in bed, watching Fred Dibnah DVDs, reading and sleeping.  Today he felt a lot better and got up.Then I went outside to let the chooks out at 8.15am.  They are always delighted to get out in the fresh air and spill from the sheds like little arrows, shooting out to find some food for breakfast.At 9am, I was back inside the house, having another cup of tea, and going to get dressed in decent clothes!  I never get dressed until I have done the outside chores as I invariably end up muddy and have to change again.  The FH had come down and was getting some breakfast.This morning I spent the bulk of my time at the computer, emailing with the Headteacher about several situations going on at school, typing up the minutes of a committee meeting which happened last night, phoning the Clerk for some advice, answering a phone call from the Head Coach and accepting the offer of some potatoes from him, and then finalising the spending records and altering the budget for the end of April.  I wrote a blog post about that too!Lunchtime came at 1pm as usual as the FH settled down to watch the One O'Clock News.  That is our ritual at that time.After lunch, I got caught up with some housework and cleaned the bathrooms upstairs, swept the kitchen floor, and then did a spot of ironing.  Just a little - the FH has finished it for me whilst I have been out.At 3pm I left the house, called in at the school, dropped off two letters at people's houses on my way to pick up the girls from school at 3.30pm.  We then dropped \"Alice in Wonderland\" off at a friend's house as she wanted to borrow a copy for her class on Thursday. By 4pm we were setting up the gym for the first class to arrive at 5pm.  We managed to get a cup of tea in before the class began and then we were off!  The first class was 5-6pm, the second from 6-8pm, and then I came home.  The FH had cooked the tea for us which was very welcome when we got home at about 8.30pm.  I had the last slice of one of these lovely cakes for pudding!  I made it on Sunday.And now I have to put the laundry away in the airing cupboard, clear up the kitchen for the night, and retire to bed to read, possibly after a bath. Hope you have all had a good day xxApril seems to have flown past - and with all that rain we have had, we seem to have spent most of it indoors around the fire, so thank goodness for the woodburner and plenty of free wood.  A friend brought us some enormous and ancient fenceposts from a relative's house in Hunstanton, and the FH chopped them into large chunks, so we have been burning them slowly - one chunk easily lasts 90 minutes or so, so they are very economical to burn and give out a good heat.Looking at the April line on the spreadsheets, some things are looking on track, and some areas definitely need to be cut back! I have found a cheaper supplier for bottled gas (£58 a bottle instead of £75 - result!) so I have been able to reduce that budget by a little.Spending on the garden has been halved as we have all the seeds and compost we need for the year, I hope, and still a little money in the pot.I had over budgeted for the landline - we seem to be underspending on that each month, so I have brought that down.Grocery spending continues to be slightly over budget, but instead of increasing the budget, I will be implementing other measures, so stay tuned.  Our average for the rest of the year needs to lie at about £230.The new diesel Skoda means that I have been able to reduce the fuel budget a little.The school activities budget has been supplemented by a further £100, especially since the YFG has been offered a trip to London to the theatre to see \"The Woman in Black\" and I have written the cheque for that today.  I usually let the girls go on school trips because they are good for expanding their horizons and I would personally not take them to the theatre in London myself!  This to me is money well spent.I have reduced the holiday budget by £100 as there seems to be plenty of leeway in that one.I haven't had time to look into the electricity supplier but I remain convinced that there are still savings to be made there.These changes have allowed me to start up the Travel fund for the EFG officially on the spreadsheet.  Our income is relatively fixed although I am in the process of talking to someone about running some more after school gym clubs, which may come off and provide a little more income.  Seeing how other people have posted their budgets online, I am not going to do that, as I have far more categories than most, and it would be a huge table, but it works for me.  As we enter the second third of the year, it seems to me to be a good time to take stock and see what is working, and what needs to be taken under stricter control.  A spot of stocktaking in the cupboards should also be on my agenda.How is your budget looking?I tried the hot water dissolving method with the laundry powder this morning, and came to the conclusion that perhaps I need to blitz it in the food processor as well - the hot water (and I used boiling water from the kettle) does not actually dissolve the grated soap in my mixture. I am very pleased with the quality of the cleaning, though, and the pleasant smell which the soap leaves - it is quite faint and the washing I managed to line dry yesterday have a truly lovely line-dried smell - much better than any chemical smell you could add to the wash. Guess I had better get the blitzing done!In the comments section of the last post, Susan raised a very sensible query - was there a risk of the grated soap clogging up the washing machine when only low temperatures are used?  I headed over to the Down To Earth forums on Rhonda Jean's blog where I knew that there would be plenty of experienced users - and I got some excellent answers:Some people blitz the powder in a food processor so that the grated soap is really broken down into a finer powder;Other suggest dissolving the measure of powder in a jug of hot water each time that they do a wash, which I would guess is having the best mixing the powder and storing it dry but then being able to use it as a liquid.I think I am going to try the dissolving it in hot water method but let us all know how you get on!"},
{"title": "Home Made Laundry powder", "date": "Sunday 29 April 2012", "text": "I started out with these ingredients, and Rhonda Jean's recipe from her book, although it is on her blog as well at http://down---to---earth.blogspot.comThere are four bars of soap in that pack, and I needed to use two of them.So I grated 2 bars of soap, with an old cheese grater, and then put it in a bowl with 2 cups each of borax and the soda crystals.  I gave it all a jolly good stir and put it into a tub with a lid, and included an old tablespoon measure which I can keep specially for this purpose.  Two tablespoons per load is the recommended measure.I have done two loads of towels with this new mixture, and not only have they come out clean as required, but they smell faintly of soap, which is quite pleasant.  I didn't add the essential oil although I might do in future.And the cost?  Very impressive!The pack of soda crystals cost 99p for the 1kg, and I used 350g, so a cost of 35p.The borax pack is £1.29 for 500g, of which I used 400g, so that cost £1.03.The four pack of soap currently costs £1.33 at Tesco, and I used two of the four bars, which cost me 66p.Total cost is £2.04 for the batch of laundry powder.  I then did the boring but predictable thing - I measured how many loads at 2tbsp each I would get from the batch and realised that 30 would be about right, hence a  cost per load of just 7p."},
{"title": "Washday blues", "date": "Saturday 28 April 2012", "text": "The rain still keeps coming and I finally had to do some washing today, so it is now hanging in the verandah, and spread across airers in front of the fire - it Has Got to get dry by tomorrow evening so I can iron the uniforms for Monday morning.  All the shirts and t shirts are on hangers so that they take up less space.Today I went to the hardware shop in town to try to buy some borax substitute in order to make my first batch of Rhonda Jean's recipe for home made laundry powder.  I can't make the laundry gloop until I save enough containers to put 10 litres of it in, so I am just aiming to make the mix of grated soap, washing soda and borax. I bought some, so I am going to make that tomorrow - I am using the last of a bottle of Surf Small and Mighty which I bought months ago when one of the supermarkets had an offer on it.  I will have some washing left to do tomorrow and can try it out - I am quite excited in a homemaker's way!  I know it is not rocket science, but if I can wash the laundry with such cheap ingredients, I will be very happy.  Fingers crossed it works.  I know that there is not much fragrance to it, so I bought a small bottle of lavender oil in Boots today so that I can have slightly scented linen for a few pennies.The chickens have had the run of the garden today as I nearly lost a welly in the run as the mud is so gloopy and deep.  They have been very very happy out on the grass and scratching up the bugs in the gravel as well as turning over the veg beds once more to find tasty worms. I hope you are all coping with the rain - I am thinking particularly of friends in Dorset who seem to have a lot of flood water rather close to home."},

{"title": "Reconnecting", "date": "Thursday 26 April 2012", "text": "This week I made one of these, and it was very much enjoyed!  This kind of cake is not made here as often as it used to be, and consequently on his six monthly check up with the cardiologist today, the FH has lost 4kg, and they were pleased with him.  Unfortunately they have given him a pretty potent drug today which has a rather unpleasant side effect, so he will be losing more weight pretty rapidly this week!!  Let's think positively - he only has to take it for a few days.This is the courgette pickle I made last summer when we had a glut of courgettes, and it was set in the cupboard with a label which indicated that it needed to mature until at least November.  The FH has been eating it with cold meats, cheeses and in sandwiches, and reports that it is even better now for a longer maturing period.  He has asked for more - perhaps I should get round to sowing some courgettes seeds!Life is getting particularly difficult at the moment in that I am spending long hours in school.  There are some significant developments going on just now, and they are going to lead to further work which will take time to reconcile to get the school back on an even keel for September.  This means that the house is continually untidy - I managed to clean some bathroom washbasins today and fling some bleach down the loos this morning, but I could have done more if I had had time.  The constant rain is hampering the laundry - why wash something if all the drying spaces are full of damp stuff already?!  And I even went to the length of looking on the internet for a tumble dryer this afternoon - I saw the prices and soon reconsidered, so don't worry, I haven't succumbed.The YFG has recommenced the piano lessons and is beginning to prepare for her Grade 1 exam.  She will start back at ballet on Saturday.  She needs a ballet leotard so I went to the local shop for one today - I was so relieved to find that they are more reasonably priced than the gymnastics ones, which are nearly £40 each, but then she wears those for far more time each week.  Ballet ones are half the price, but then I had a shock when the chap said that the character skirts are £55.  I soon decided that we will look for a second hand one!  It is ridiculous to pay that much for something she will wear for less than 20 minutes a week!  Getting things into perspective, I wouldn't pay that much for a skirt for everyday wear.The EFG is working very hard for her upcoming GCSE exams - we have a timetable fixed to her bedroom wall so we can see exactly when they are all to be held.  She starts on Monday with two full days of Art.  She went to help at Guides last night but found that she wasn't really needed and spent the time looking through her folder, so she has decided that she probably ought to be using her time at home with her work.  Guides can go on the back burner for a few weeks.I am longing for better weather again, as I am sure most people in the UK are.  May is on the horizon already, so I do hope that it will bring us more springlike weather.  I do feel for all those people whose homes are threatened by floodwater at this time, and hope that you are all safe and well."},
{"title": "Banking on us", "date": "Wednesday 25 April 2012", "text": "Listening to Stephanie Flanders on the BBC news now, I have just heard her say that the economic recovery depends on consumers spending money..........what money would that be, then? What with the rising prices of fuel and food, the changes to the taxation system and the benefits for families, and the general malaise in the country, I am not sure what money the bigwigs think that we might all have spare to spend on getting Britain out of recession.As a family, the girls have held sway today, and we seem to be going on holiday in the Skoda - packing it will be the challenge of a lifetime.  It makes economic sense - I can get almost 600 miles on a tank of diesel for £55, so I am sure that that would be enough diesel for the week, and more!  But we will have to be very canny with the luggage and think twice about what we want and need to take along...The FH was having doubts today that we can afford to go on holiday, but I soon put him right - the accommodation is already paid for, and we have our pot of spending money, so all we need now is some food, which we would need anyway if we stayed at home.Spending here will continue to be kept fairly strictly under control.  I went into the Co-op today for a packet of pork chops, expecting to pay about £3 or £4, so I was very pleased to come out with a reduced £1.75 pack and even more pleased to be able to report that that was all I bought!  We continue to track our spending on a spreadsheet, and I can see how we are doing against all the annual figures.  Some sections are doing better than others, and so I know where I need to think more creatively.I hope you are all keeping track and managing your money, rather than letting yourselves be managed by money, or lack thereof!The EFG's aged and beloved female rabbit, Rosie, died last night.  When the EFG went out to them yesterday evening, she knew that Rosie was leaving us, and she called me out there to see her as well.  She sat in the corner of her hutch, quiet and peaceful, not moving at all.  She let us touch her, stroke her, and talk to her.  We said our goodbyes, blessed her and wished her peace.  This morning, she had indeed gone.  UJ has taken her body home with him tonight, and he will bury her under the trees in his orchard, where she can truly rest in peace."},

Shattered tonight so have just cooked some food for tea, fed the hens and collected the eggs, done a load of washing and hung two more loads up, made a cake for the lunchboxes and have got to do the school uniform ironing and then I am off to bed!  Imagine what I could have achieved if I hadn't been so tired from the day out ;)Just popping in to say Good Morning!  We are off to chapel this morning to the service, and to say Good bye to a dear friend who is 80+ and moving to Northamptonshire to live with her daughter.  We will still see her but she will only return to the village occasionally to see other family members who remain here.  We are all a bit sad that she is leaving as she is a wonderful person and will be very much missed.After that, the YFG and I are heading northwards to a gymnastics competition, in which she is participating this afternoon.  We have 13 gymnasts taking part, and this is the first time our club has entered this competition so we don't really know what to expect! Hope to let you know how it all went later xx"},
{"title": "Expectations", "date": "Thursday 19 April 2012", "text": "I've been mulling things over now and again, and thinking about what we want out of our lifestyle.  Not the deep and meaningful \"what we want out of life\" - no, I'm leaving that for another day.  I've had time to think about why we live the way we do, and what we want to get from living like this.I think the girls \"get\" that we don't spend a lot of money on consumables in order to conserve money for things that matter, that make a difference in the grand scheme of things.  If I explain that I need to save for the EFG's travel fund, they understand that that is important.  Telling the EFG that she can't download yet another Vampire book for her Kindle is taken stoically when she grasps that they are not at the top of the priority list.  The YFG is also on board, easily seeing that she does gymnastics already as well as Guides, and that if she wants to do ballet, she can't continue Guides as well - there is a set amount of money in the Activities budget and it won't stretch to two things.  That sort of attitude and understanding is great.  I don't want any comments about being mean not letting her do both; it is about education for their future.  In the big wide world, young adults don't get a lot of financial information, and we as parents are the first line for them.  We need to be strong and not give in to childish demands, and help them understand the ways of the world.  Tesco won't let you leave with all your food if you can only pay for half of it, for example.Children also need to grasp the concept of working in exchange for payment.  There are always jobs that the girls can do in exchange for money.  They each have a daily job that they are required to do as a contribution to the household, which both are now used to doing although it took some nagging to get them into the routine. But if something is not worth their effort, why should it be worth my effort on their behalf?  So if extra pennies are wanted for extras that they desire, I am quite happy to help them to achieve the extra cash, but I don't often just buy whatever it is they want.  This is reflected in our lives - they see us save up for items, they hear us discuss whether the sofas will get replaced this year or next, what might be a higher priority for the household, which car to take on a long journey to get the best miles per pound of fuel, etc.  These sorts of discussions are openly held, and the girls participate and add their opinions - they want to take the Skoda to Yorkshire, and it would get the best mpp but we wouldn't get all the luggage in, so we are still talking about that one.  And the sofas? No, not on the list this year!  Higher priorities are the travel fund and the maintenance on the house....Thrift in our daily lives is evident.  I put on a waterproof jacket this morning and looked it at, muttering to myself about the mud around the hem of it, saying that it was probably still Kindrogan mud.  I went on a geography residential field trip to Kindrogan Field Centre (it has changed a bit since I was there - 5 of us slept in an attic bedroom that was nothing like the bedrooms in the tour, and definitely no en-suite!) in Perthshire when I was 17.  My mum had to buy me a waterproof kagoule and trousers, and although the trousers have long been passed on, the kagoule top is still in first class condition 22 years later.  Similarly I was wearing a jacket the other day that I have had over 15 years, and it washes well, keeps me warm and I find it really comfy for the garden and popping to the village, so why would I pass it on?  We don't live terribly disposable lives, and I am doing my best to instill the same values in the girls, although I am fast discovering that the YFG is probably destined to be a model, if the number of times she changes her clothes in a day is anything to go by; that is a work in progress!"},

I had an easy morning as I knew the later part of the day was going to be a long one, so I pottered around and did odd jobs for a while.  I had a bath, and then some lunch, and then it all kicked off.First was a meeting at school about the arrangements for pre-school, then I moved on to teach an after school gym club, still at school.  I dropped my assistant home and then had to go to an office for a meeting at 5pm.  There have been some interesting and challenging decisions to make there, quick trip to Tesco to get some eye drops for the YFG, and then home.  Driving through heavy rain was hard work on the concentration front, and as soon as I got home, the EFG was ready to go to Guides so off we popped straight away there.  Luckily I could then come home and collapse!  I made myself a wheatfree pitta bread, and made a cup of tea - enough!  Tonight I've caught up with emails and contacted a lady who has bought something from me on ebay, so I have to get the delivery of that organised.I think tomorrow will be a doddle compared to today - housework is on the agenda, along with some ironing, so I can give my brain a rest....Hope you have had a good Wednesday.

And this is the new tin - in Her Majesty's 60th year of reigning, I thought she was well-qualified to watch over my pennies this time.  These tins are rather common at the moment, so there are probably some in a cheap shop near you, if you live in the UK!And so, drum roll, please .......£141.76 is the holiday spending fund!!This is what we will have to spend on days out, treats like ice cream, and maybe a meal out on the last night or so.

{"title": "A fresh start", "date": "Monday 16 April 2012", "text": "The Summer term commences tomorrow - so we have new beginnings. The beginning of the end for the EFG - her last few weeks at secondary school, as she will have finished all her exams by the second week after half term in June, and so she is now on the home stretch of this stage of her education.Spring is really here now and so I have begun the grass cutting season - the front lawn was done on Saturday and the back today.  It is very satisfying to see the short, uniform grass rather than the rather untidy thatch that the winter had left!  The rabbits will be glad to get out of their cages in rotation and spend time on the lawn in the run - I think Guiness might get the first honour!The EFG spent her morning at school today doing an art workshop in preparation for her upcoming exam.  So the YFG and I dropped her off at 8.50am and pootled off across the fields to the lovely Cambridgeshire town of St Ives.  It was a very pleasant journey, and I called in on a friend, and then we mooched around the town market.  It has been years since I looked around that market, and it has changed and moved on, now boasting stalls selling mobiles, for example, and yet it has stayed the same in that the veg stalls still stand in exactly the same spot that I remember!  We didn't have time to go down to the river and feed the swans, but on a longer visit, that would have been where I would have enjoyed lingering.  We popped into Poundland and spent a few - we don't have one in this area so it is a novelty to see all the things that they can manage to sell for just £1!This afternoon I spent time in the garden, doing the lawn mowing as well as tidying up all the strawberry plants and talking to the chooks.  They are laying at least 20 eggs a day now and so I need to find some new customers!! I gave two dozen away today - one to a friend in the village who does our hair and the other to my friend in St Ives.  And what of the weekend and the meditations?  It was a good weekend on lots of levels.  Friday was hectic, with the YFG having a friend here overnight on Thursday and then having the friend stay all day on Friday, having a marathon Wii session.  The friend is an only child so they do enjoy playing together when they get the chance.  Another pair of little friends had already been invited to tea, so I cooked them Toad in the Hole, and then chocolate buns for pudding.  They went home well stuffed at 7.30pm and I took the girls and we went babysitting in the village.  We had a very relaxing evening, watching tv and reading, whilst the little girl remained fast asleep all the time we were there - we never even saw her!On Saturday, we spent most of the day at home until I took the girls out in the late afternoon to do a spot of uniform shopping.  The EFG needed a pair of black trousers that she could wear for this half term to school but which would still be useful when uniform is no longer needed.  We got two pairs of cheapish ones from Asda, and popped in to some other shops whilst we were out.  It was a lovely ride home across the fields again.  I do enjoy driving in the countryside at this time of year!Saturday evening the girls decided to have a sleepover together on the lounge floor in their sleeping bags, and watch some films.  They have their moments of togetherness, and this was one of them - sometimes they seem to really get on, and at other times appear not to be able to stand one another!!  So I encouraged them to spend time together, and indulged them - I didn't wake them on Sunday morning and the FH and I slipped out at 9.15am to go to church and left them sleeping.....Today has been lovely too, although the YFG was very very quiet this morning.  Eventually I extracted the problem that she was worrying about - some homework - and so when we picked up the EFG, she was able to nip into school and have a word with the teacher who was in school as it was a training day.  She has been back to her normal self this afternoon and much happier!This evening I have turned up one of the pairs of trousers for the EFG to wear tomorrow and we have watched Silent Witness together.  I bought two large pieces of topside this morning at reduced prices, so I have cooked them both this afternoon and now 16 portions of beef reside in the freezer - 4 dinners for 4 people - half with accompanying gravy made from the juices as well!  Can't wait to dig into that one Sunday lunch time!I hope you have all had a peaceful and relaxing weekend.  We are back into the fray tomorrow: the girls are off to school and I have a meeting at school here in the morning, followed by gym in the later afternoon and early evening.......best get some rest!!"},

I've been reading too many blogs lately, I feel, and don't know whose advice to follow for the best!!  I feel like I have information overload, a chronic shortage of time caused by spending too much of it on here, and too many choices to make...and I could easily begin to feel drastically inferior, reading of people's housecleaning routines, beauty routines, workout schedules, etc.Sometimes I wish I was like Shadow, the cat, answerable to no one, with no responsibilities and no expectations beyond food in my belly and somewhere to curl up and doze.But I am not like that, and I do have those things to consider.First things first.  I'm taking a few days off from here - and from all other blog reading too - and I am spending the weekend in the real world.With my husband and children.  With friends and family.  Doing some housework, some exercise, some garden work, some chook cleaning out, some decluttering, some ironing...taking care of life!Knitting, reading, talking, cooking, creating, learning.Finding MY way.  Finding out what works best for me.  Thinking, plotting and considering.Hope you all have a great weekend.  Only this weekend before we dive right back into the Summer term, GCSEs, church plans, holiday plans, gym competitions....See you all next week x"},
{"title": "Loch of the Lowes Webcam", "date": "Tuesday 10 April 2012", "text": "I have turned the photo of Lancelot in to a quicklink to the webcam at Loch of the Lowes where Lady the osprey has returned for the 23rd year, apparently.  So when I want to have a quick look to see how she is doing (no eggs yet), I have an easy link.  Feel free to use it yourselves, although I have put it there for my own convenience!!The YFG has been saving up since Christmas for a new phone as hers died a death last term.  She has managed without one, but I have to admit that I like her to have one so that I can get in touch with her if I want to when she is out and about.  It's a bit tricky ringing a house phone when she is at someone's house for the first time, and whispering to her, \"Are they OK? Are you having a nice time?\" especially now that she is at secondary school and mixing with people whose parents I don't know.  She is able to send me a text and let me know that all is well!  She finally had enough money last week and we ordered it, and it was delivered this morning.  She was so excited, so pleased with herself and all her strategies to acquire the money - and that is what I want to encourage in my children.  I don't want them to look for credit, to be impatient and think that they \"deserve\" to have everything straight away.  The EFG has similarly bought herself a new camera this week.  She has also been saving up for it, and wanted it for her coursework with art.  I encouraged and motivated her and she is thrilled with her new piece of technology....taking lots of photos already!  I am trying to help them to realise that work brings rewards, and that they have to be patient.  I don't want them to move out of here when they are older and expect to move into a house of a similar size and standard, for example.  I lived in a little rented house at university for a year, with electric heating we couldn't afford to run, cardboard thin walls, and nearly two miles from the college so I walked everywhere all the time.  We worked hard to get where we are today, and they can't expect to have everything they enjoy here straight away.  I understand now that if they work hard and save very hard for several years before they get into marriage and children, they can put themselves into a better position.  I just have to help them to understand that, rather than wasting income on gadgets, furniture and cars!!I am reading Down to Earth by Rhonda Hetzel at the moment and really enjoying it.  I will need to read it again with a notebook at my side, and I can't wait to get some of the right yarn to try knitting a dishcloth!  I love most of the ideas she has, and Love the book!I had to buy some cucumber seeds tonight as the seeds I had bought the FH had sowed and they had bolted and were useless, so I needed more.  I like to support heritage seeds, so I buy some from The Real Seed Catalogue but remembered the name incorrectly and ended up on a website selling cannabis seeds!!  Needless to say, I closed that one down rather quickly without making a purchase, and swiftly looked more closely for the site I really wanted!!!  Shocking how easily these mistakes can be made."},
{"title": "End of first quarter", "date": "Monday 9 April 2012", "text": "The end of March may be a week or two ago, but I have just got round to sorting out the end of the quarter's figures, so that I can compare the first three month's spending against the whole budget for the year.Several points have come to light:The Council Tax has gone up, so I needed to adjust that budget slightly, since it was made before I knew whether it would go up and by how much.  An extra £40 required in there.The electricity budget is plodding along on track but it is past the time I should have been looking for a cheaper supplier.  On the \"to do\" list this week.The TV licence pot can be reduced - the FH will turn 75 at the end of the year, so since ours is due in July, we will only pay about half (although I don't know whether we pay it all and then get a rebate, but it will all come out in the wash!)The Grocery budget is OK, but we have to reduce the average amount spent per month in order to compensate for stocking up which took place in the wintery months.  With the garden in production later in the year, this should all even out.  I will keep a careful eye on this one!I have money in a pot for RAC membership, but I may take that out with Tesco vouchers.  I will have to weigh up the pros and cons of that.  Now that we  no longer have the motorhome, I may change back to the AA, as we have a friend who is a patrolman and he gets commission on sign ups.  I'll have to check into all the possibilities for this one, too.The cars are both insured for the year, and it came in at £62 more than I had budgeted, so I have had to put that into the pot.  It is OK though, as I have a newer car than I had when I set the budget, so it is to be expected that the insurance was a little more.  I have reduced the pot for school trips as the EFG will be out of school between the middle of June and September, and I can't imagine that they will spend the whole amount I had set aside in the Autumn.  Since the YFG will not be going on a skiing trip for £999 next year, I am fine with this!I had overestimated the cat food bill, so that pot has been reduced a little.The medication bill has had to be increased.  I take a daily medication which I cannot get on the NHS in the brand I need - they prescribe a generic which doesn't agree with me, won't prescribe the brand I need, so I have to buy it myself...Wavering over whether to include the interest on the ISA which has been paid or should I only include the savings I have made this year from actual income?  Have yet to decide on that one!What with all the changes, I have reduced the overall budget by £16, so that is theoretically £16 to put to savings...And the SFT Sealed pot challenge?  The pot is 3/4 full!  I am so pleased - and can't wait to get it full.  I haven't weighed it lately, but it is getting heavy.  We have decided that we might open it for holiday spending money in the summer half term, which would still leave the rest of June to the end of September to save for a birthday treat for me!  I think that however much is in there, we probably wouldn't spend it all - we have decided what we want to do when we are on holiday, so I know roughly how much cash I need for the days out....but more of that another time!Hoping you have all had a peaceful Easter and been able to spend time with those you love.  We have had UJ over for lunch yesterday, and then my Dad came over in the late afternoon for some time with the girls and us.  The EFG and I have had a quiet day together today, and the YFG went out last night to a sleepover round the corner, and just came home about an hour ago.  It is nice to have her back."},
{"title": "Happy Birthday Mum x", "date": "Saturday 7 April 2012", "text": "I have been taking some time to remember my mum today.  She would have been 71 today, so I bought some flowers and put them in a nice vase on the table to remind me of her birthday for a few days.  I don't go to her grave often for she isn't there; she is here, with us, in our hearts.  My dad, bless him, looks after the grave for us, and my sister puts flowers there sometimes.  Mum knew the EFG for about 18 months before they were separated.  They would have had such good times together as the EFG grew up, and she would have loved the YFG as well.  I remember her pushing the pram around Cupar, sneaking little star shaped chocolate to the EFG (can't remember what they are called!?) when she thought I wasn't looking - I think I have made up for all the chocolate they would have shared, though, so the EFG hasn't missed out on that!The girls do miss out on grandparents, in a way.  My dad is lovely to them, very proud of them, interested in all they do and want to achieve, and supports their ambitions, but there is only the one of him, and the other three grandparents have all passed on.  He is 83 this year, and slowing down.  The girls do their best to keep him up to date with the technology, though, and he is very pleased when they put his photos on DVDs and pop them in the tv for him to share with us.Funny how the pregnancy was never mentioned because I was 400 miles away, on the end of the phone, and it could be avoided, and I was an unmarried mother, so not quite respectable.  But once the EFG was born, named after my own grandmother, the outpouring of love began, and it never stopped.  The EFG and her Granny spent the second week of February together in Cupar that year, although my dad had offered to take Mum to Malta, and she said, \"No, let's go and see (the EFG) again\" so they came.  Mum died just a few days after they returned home.It does me good to remember each year, remember the love, remember the sharing and the history we had.  The good times as well as the rough times which we got through.  Our faith.  Our love.  Her generosity and hospitality.  Her kindness as well as her sharp tongue at times.  Her thriftiness, her love for us as children, and her support for us as adults.  Her dedication to her big brother and her mother.  Contentment.  Hard work.  Afternoon naps.  Sewing dresses for our dolls in secret for Christmas presents - fantastic outfits made in velvet.  Three of us in matching summer dresses one year.  I hope I am doing enough to make her proud still.  Not what she hoped for me, nor what she had as ambitions for me, but perhaps a different path to a similar achievement one day."},
{"title": "All done in!", "date": "Thursday 5 April 2012", "text": "The girls broke up from school on Friday, but that wasn't the end!  We still had gym on Saturday, two church services on Sunday and then gym Holiday Club Monday to Wednesday for 4 hours a day.  Today feels like it has been the first day I have had \"off\"....And what have I done?  Washing, deep-cleaned the hall, some tidying in the kitchen, emails and invoices for various things, listing on ebay, more washing, moving the ironed clothes upstairs, etc.  The FH took the girls to meet his sister at their parents' graves - an annual visit.  He bought a new pair of shoes on the way home, and then this afternoon, the girls went out on their bikes - they delivered some eggs to a friend, posted an Easter card to my old Kindergarten teacher, took some Easter gifts to friends, and then visited with a little friend for the afternoon.  They came home just in time for tea!Tonight I have been doing some work on the Sunday service, and the girls have been designing posters for the Craft Club ladies for tomorrow morning - we are doing a sponsored knit for the Samaritan's Purse appeal and the ladies want to advertise for spare wool.  UJ is coming for lunch on Sunday, so I am hoping to find something good in the depths of the freezers, and we have so many eggs that I am going to have to start making lemon curd again - the girls are laying anything between 14 and 25 eggs a day at the moment - the day that the clocks changed, the explosion of egg laying began, and they haven't looked back yet!  I'll make some kind of cake for the weekend as well."},

{"title": "Abundant life", "date": "Thursday 29 March 2012", "text": "Christian friends, my eyes have been opened a little wider today - read John 10:1-10 and then read v10 again.  Depending on the translation you are reading, the exact words will vary, but the common thread will be the same.Good News bible says, \"I have come in order that you might have life - life in all its fullness.\"The NIV has, \"I have come that they might have life, and have it to the full.\"The NRSV (Anglicized version) says,\"I came that they might have life, and have it abundantly.\"Our lives should be full and abundant - these are positive images of plenty and enjoyment, not lives wracked by guilt, feeling that we should constantly be working, sacrificially for others.  Sure, we should do plenty of good things, but we have to get life in balance.  Balance.  No sitting on the sofa watching DVDs for 12 hours a day, but a proper balance.We are called to love one another AS we love ourselves, as well.  Wise is the woman who can do that, and I am not her, yet!I was blessed today by the posting at The Quiet Home, and I watched the film that the post links to, and I think that if you are anything like me, you would benefit from watching it too.I am going to spend some time on ME, and thinking about how I can get life more in balance.After I have folded the washing, cleared the kitchen up, and remade the bed.....(joking...not!) ;)(image from dailymail.co.uk)Small investments make only small differences but like the famous saying goes, \"it all adds up\", and indeed it does.  The price of stamps is going to rise quite dramatically at the end of April, so I have a month to make perhaps a series of investments.Buying stamps is like buying loo roll - I just know that I am going to use them eventually!!The price of first class stamps will rise from 46p to 60p each and the second class stamps will go from 36p to 50p.  Yet it is possible to buy them now and they will still be valid even after the price rises, because they have no value printed on them, just the indication as to whether they are 1st or 2nd class.Second class stamps are fine for most of the letters and cards I send out, so I plan to invest £36 and buy a hundred.  After the 30 April, those same stamps would cost me £50 so the saving is clear.  If I have another opportunity before the end of April, I may even invest in a second book of 100.  They don't expire, so if they last me a couple of years, I am still quids in, and I just know that the price of stamps is never going to come down, unfortunately.I use less stamps now than I used to, with the advent of email, online and telephone banking, and bill payment online and on the phone.  But I do still send cards and letters through the mail occasionally, and that personal touch is still important at some times."},
{"title": "Keeping the balls in the air", "date": "Wednesday 28 March 2012", "text": "Or the plates spinning, or any picture you want to paint to imagine the same thing.  I can't keep them all up at the same time, and when a new one needs to be kept up, one of the others comes crashing down.  So the plates called School, Gymnastics, Church, Children, and Husband, and Finances are all spinning nicely.  Unfortunately, the ones called Me and House crashed some time ago.  If I try to put either of those two back up, others are going to come down.Church is looking shaky, I have to admit, and it could be that one of the more stable ones will have to wobble a bit more in order to make Church spin a bit faster!  Which one to wobble, though?Finances can't wobble, as that affects everyone.  If I let any wobble, someone gets let down.  When Me and House wobble, fewer people suffer, so they are easier to let wobble.BUT letting the plate called Me be one of the wobbly ones means that perhaps my ability to keep all the other plates up is compromised..........This is a recurring theme here, and the answer is still the same - what do I do?  Who do I let down?  I wish I could just hire a cleaner twice a week!  I have thought of a plan - wouldn't ever work but it is wishful thinking - most of what I do is voluntary work at school, church and gym, so if everyone did a few hours a week, those who don't want to do things that need qualifications (like gym) or require study (church) or taking serious amounts of responsibility (school), then people could sign up to do supportive things for those of us who do those things - they could help with housework or gardening!  I had a wonderful friend in Scotland who came and did my ironing every Friday morning who was a Godsend, and she did it for love, just because I did things for her, took her places and did things for others as well and that was her way of paying back.  It felt a bit uncomfortable the first couple of times, but I soon realised that she wanted to contribute and it made her happy to be useful at her time of life.  So, I need to get off here and do something - clean up the breakfast debris, hang out the washing, hoover the sitting room, write a Building Report, call the contact at the church I am preaching at on Sunday.....at least the weather is glorious again!"},
{"title": "Looking forward", "date": "Sunday 25 March 2012", "text": "I've now done 950 posts, so I guesstimate that I may post the 1000th sometime in about June, perhaps around the longest day - and last night we changed the clocks, which has made me look forward to better weather and more energy.I do suffer a little with SAD, the lack of sunshine which makes me a little depressed, but I don't get it anywhere near as bad as I used to.  This time of year is hard for me, remembering my mum.  Every month just now there is something to jolt my memories of her back in to a sharper focus; she is there all the time but the loss becomes more acute at this time.  February marks the anniversary of her death, March brings Mothering Sunday, and April is the month which holds her birthday.  Three months in a row.  No wonder I used to really look forward to the middle of April, when I knew that the days would be brighter and this time of remembrance would have passed.But now I look at it differently, and I try to enjoy the remembering instead of suffering it, and bask in the memories of the good times, and the happy things.  So many things which she loved remind me of her at this time of year in particular - she loved the little daffodil-type flowers called Cheerfulness, blue irises, snowdrops and bluebells.  So I plan to put together a little box of items which I will accumulate between now and that 1000th post.  They will all be items which my mum would have loved - those things I see and think, \"Oh, Mum would have loved that!\" so who knows what I will find in the time to come.  All commenters between now and then will be entered and I'll let you know when we are approaching the 1000th post."},

Yesterday was glorious and we are promised the same over the weekend and into next week - yesterday was more like May than March, so I hope it lasts a while.  The garden is not even remotely ready for spring sowing, though - I am hoping to get out there and get the remaining three beds dug over, and the first three hoed so that broad beans and perhaps potatoes can go in very soon!  The lack of water won't help....we are in a hosepipe ban area from the beginning of April.  We are exempt from that, actually, because the FH has a disabled Blue Badge, but I don't intend to take advantage of that exemption - I do find watering cans concentrate the water where I want it far more accurately, and I kid myself that the exercise of lugging the cans is doing me some good.  We are not ones for watering the lawn, either, so we don't even have a sprinkler!This morning I am being grateful for my semi-tidy and clean sitting room - it is a joy to have a clear dining table at last!  Again!  It gets cluttered easily and I do have to work when it is clear to keep it so...Hope you all have a great weekend and that you have some sunshine where you are too xx"},
{"title": "Catching up again", "date": "Tuesday 20 March 2012", "text": "Life is getting complicated but you seem to be having patience with me - thanks!  There is just so much to do in real life that keeping up to date on here is less of a priority these days.  I'll just record the highlights of the past week or two:The EFG has been offered places at all three of the Sixth Forms to which she applied.  She now has to work to get the grades to be able to attend the one she really wants.  That means I need to start the savings campaign for her train fare: £300 a month between now and September....and if she gets in, that will be for the train season ticket we will buy in September, and then we will put away £150 a month for the next year to buy the second season ticket the following autumn.  I'm going to phone the bank and open a Season Ticket account, I think!The YFG is working for a gym competition just after Easter, so she is training hard.  She is also helping a volunteer train to become a coach, so attended a day at a gym near Norwich last Sunday, and will do so again this Sunday, and loved having access to better equipment than we have - a vaulting table, a sprung floor and foam pits!  She came home with sore hands, and exhausted, but having really enjoyed herself....The OH has got his spring burst of energy and is spending time outdoors in the good weather, returning to the fireside when the clouds come.  His health is up and down, but generally stable.And me, I am OK.  I feel under pressure with everything that I have taken on, but determined to carry on with it all.  Yesterday I blocked the day out in my diary and spent the day at home, ironing and pootling around the house doing things!  There is a need for more days like that, but I will struggle to get one each week.  Today brings gym this afternoon, tomorrow the after-school club and a meeting at school, Thursday has piano lesson and then a Governor training session, and Friday has chapel knitting and gym.  Saturday holds gym and ballet, shopping and washing, and then we are back to Sunday.  I have no service to prepare this week, but for Palm Sunday, I have to take an assessed service - I hadn't realised that one of my services has to be assessed each plan, but I am getting used to it.  And the eating round here?  The EFG claims not to \"understand\" the plan and says she will eat what she is given.  That to me means that she is taking no responsibility for herself, and adds to the strain.  I suppose she can then say that if the weightloss is not there on Friday, she has eaten what I gave her and therefore it is not her fault.  But there is more to it than that, and her drinking and activity levels are also relevant - she often doesn't drink enough through the day and has been advised to drink more.  She stayed the same last week, and so I hope that there is a loss for her this week.  I am looking forward to our holiday in Bridlington - I have to make the balance payment this week, and so I am relieved that the savings have mounted up over the last few weeks so that I have accumulated the amount needed.  The next focus will be for acquiring some spending money; I have been doing some ebaying to declutter some stuff from the house, so that will be ramped up in the next few weeks in the attempt to have a clean house before we go as well as some money in our pockets for some treats and days out!  I have quite a stash of Tesco Clubcard vouchers so I plan to check out what we can do in the area with some of those....I'm sure there will be something.Enough wittering for this morning - hope you all have a good day, and thanks for coming back again!"},

I gave her an antihistamine, in case it was an allergic reaction to something - she's allergic to horses and cats so we know what that looks like in her, and I am have an allergic reaction on my face if I eat fresh cherries - and she held a cold flannel on her face.  The school advised me to speak with the doctor's surgery, who confirmed that the slap cheek virus has been reported locally, so they diagnosed her over the phone!She'll be off school tomorrow as well, but I hope she'll be back at the coal face on Thursday.  The doctor told us that once the rash has appeared she is no longer contagious and could go to school, but she feels quite rough, so I am not rushing her back.The EFG went to the climbing wall at the local activity centre with the Guides last night - it was subsidised so it only cost £2.50 to us, which was excellent value for money.  It wiped her out though and she didn't come to gymnastics tonight.Hope you are all well!"},
{"title": "Meals for the EFG", "date": "Saturday 3 March 2012", "text": "I will keep a note of the meals that the EFG eats this week, and then I can share and pass on ideas.Tonight the rest of the family has had a mince mixture (like bolognaise for spag bol) with rice and broccoli, but she has had a sort of pancake made from 2 eggs, beaten up and then just poured into the flattest frying pan and allowed to cook through.  I then put it onto a baking dish, put a couple of spoonfuls of mince onto one side of it and flipped the other side over it and sprinkled some grated cheese over it, popped it under the grill for a couple of minutes and hey presto - a savoury pancake which she had with some broccoli.  She said it was nice!Rainbowchild asked about the regime that the EFG is using for her weightloss.  I am sharing it here, but feel free to ask questions if you want.  I will say now that I am not opening up a debate about the health, safety, scientific proof, efficacy or anything else of this particular regime - I am JUST sharing information.The rules we are following work like this:Fruit only on an empty stomach (first thing in the morning or at least a couple of hours since the last food eaten)Carbohydrates eaten only with non-fat foods.  NOT with proteins or fats.  Carbohydrates should be wholegrain, so we are using wholemeal pasta, and wholemeal bagels/bread.  I would be using brown rice if the EFG would eat rice!Proteins can be eaten with fats, and with vegetables.  NOT with carbs.There should be at least three hours between meals of different sorts - so between carb based and protein based meals for example.No sugar.So a typical day for the EFG might go like this:Breakfast - omelette made with a couple of eggs, cheese and bacon.Mid morning snack - fruitLunch at school - smorgasbord collection of raw veggies, salad stuff and cheese/cold meat type of mealSnack at home time - a re-run of lunch as a salad on a plate, perhaps lettuce, tomato, cucumber, cress, hard boiled egg.  Tea with the family - whatever we are having modified slightly - bolognaise (mince, tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, onion, etc) but with veggies instead of with spaghetti; roast meat (chicken, pork, etc) with veggies; etcSupper - wholemeal bagel with Quark and chopped onion; wholemeal bread with salad and fatfree dressing; wholemeal pasta with salad veg/veg and fatfree dressing.There are a lot of vegetables and salads, a fair amount of protein and fat, and not that much carbohydrates in this case.  It works for the EFG and we will continue for a while with this regime.  On Friday evenings we get home from gymnastics at about 8pm, and she is allowed to have whatever she wants for her tea, and a sweet treat if she wants one.  If something like this helps others, good luck.  At the moment we are following this pretty strictly and using simple recipes.  I know that there is a lot of scope for using more interesting recipes to develop this as a longer term lifestyle.  It is likely that the EFG will have to avoid sugar as a lifelong choice in order to help her insulin levels.  I just hope that when the doctor reviews her again, he notices the difference!"},
{"title": "Proud mum feeling", "date": "Friday 2 March 2012", "text": "The EFG has achieved a further 5lb loss this week, and I am SO proud of her.  She chose some Ben & Jerry's cookie dough flavour ice cream for her treat for tonight, and she certainly deserves it!  She is allowed a treat on a Friday night, so that she has something to look forward to, and it is a little splurge from the rules of the regime.  Last week she had a few oven chips with her chicken, which would not normally have been allowed, before having a little ice cream.  You have to have a little treat now and again!I just wish I had her dedication...my backside isn't getting any smaller....We are on our Co-op bandwagon for March, and are planning to save more money for the holiday payment at the end of the month - we have until the 22nd, I think, to get together about £700.  It is a good job I like a challenge!  I have paid off the credit card bill which had the two car insurance payments on it - bad timing that they both went on the same month's bill - I'll have to try to spread it out a bit further next year.  I do prefer to pay those in one annual payment rather than having dribs and drabs going out of the account each month.There was a meeting at school last night for the EFG and I - we received her school exam timetable for her remaining GCSE exams, and found out all the arrangements for study leave.  The upshot is that it seems that most of her exams fall before the June half-term, and then after that, she will have one week for further study and then her final two exams fall on the following Monday and Tuesday - and she's done!  She seems to be free then from about the 18th June until she starts Sixth form somewhere in early September - whatever will she do?  We know that she will have the opportunity to attend induction days for Sixth form, but she is also thinking about getting some work experience in there too.And the YFG? She's badgering me to allow her to start Ballet...can we fit it in? Do I want to fit it in?  Will the FH co-operate with the transportation because it is not that local...how much will it all cost?  More thinking about this one required!"},

{"title": "Straw", "date": "Monday 27 February 2012", "text": "The one that broke the camel's back, I mean.You have read what I have been dealing with just lately, and tonight I got an email that was basically just a sarcastic remark from someone who needs to grow up, and so all I feel like doing now is bawling my eyes out.  Ho hum...The EFG recorded an 8lb loss in her first week on the new regime, which was very rewarding for us.  We are trying very hard with this, and she is being very diligent, which I am very proud of her for doing.  Weigh day is Friday, so we have to wait to see how this week will go but I am hopeful that the loss will continue, although realistically, it should slow down a little!  We went to see the dietitian last week, and she was helpful, but she will refer the EFG to a specialist diabetic team which deals with insulin resistance as well as diabetes; she is a pediatric specialist and doesn't see diabetic patients, so it was a while since she had seen anyone needing that kind of advice.  She mentioned that the regime we are using has no scientific studies which support it, but that doesn't bother us as we are looking for something which works for the EFG, whether it has any scientific background or not - the variations of it are myriad and well published, with lots of reports which say it works!  The Slimming World Original plan, the Atkins, Dukan etc are all slightly different, and it matters not which one uses, as long as it suits the purpose and it works!I do think that once the weight loss is established, the plan might change a little towards the SW plan which would give her a little more leeway with her packed lunches, but for now, we are working with this.Last week was manic, and I ended up driving over 500 miles.  What with two interviews for Sixth form and the dietitian for the EFG, the orthodontist for the YFG and a full day at school on Wednesday, as well as the usual commitments at gymnastics, I was shattered by Saturday afternoon, and had to have a snooze!  The FH stepped up admirably last week and undertook to hang out some washing and do some hoovering and ironing, so I was very impressed with him too.  This week is looking quite challenging as well: back to the orthodontist with the YFG this morning, Church Council tomorrow morning,  a bookfair and a school meeting for the EFG on Thursday as well as the usual gym and school commitments, so it is going to be another busy week.The EFG was thrilled on Thursday to have her train track braces removed, although her perfectly straight teeth now resemble dentures, she thinks, particularly the \"doggy dentures\" ad on the tv!  She had to stand in front of the mirror for quite some time to practice her new smile.  We are going back this morning to have retainers fitted in order to hold the new smile firmly in place.I had to chuckle last night as the EFG was troubled by the heap of washing that had been sitting on the landing for a while waiting to be washed so she has set up a system of baskets, and written notices to put places where people leave heaps of washing, telling them to put the clothes in the baskets!  She has excellent intentions, so I hope it works.And the budget?  I'm still working on that.  The Sealed Pot is getting heavier - I had thought I would save all my £2 coins, but I am acquiring rather a lot of those and putting them all in the pot was meaning I never had any money!  I am thinking twice now before putting each one in the pot, but a lot still make it through the slot.  The budget is proving more tricky and I am slowly working my way through it to see where I can shave a bit off each fund to increase the savings.  In order to fund the train ticket in September, I would need to put £300 a month away between now and September, and then from September £150 a month until the next September for the second year's ticket.  I just have to get the credit card bill with both car insurances on it paid off, and then there is the balance of the June half-term holiday to think about before the end of March.  Quite challenging if I am not to dip into savings to pay that lot off - it amounts to £1382......So, in the spirit of Lent, there is to be another Challenge here.  This is Fairtrade fortnight, and I am still mulling over my Tesco problem, so I am combining all of that with my Lent challenge.  I talked to the girls about this yesterday and we are thinking that for March, we will only shop at the Co-op, the most ethical supermarket in our opinion, and the biggest supporter we know locally of Fairtrade.  We will also have a storecupboard challenge and restrict our spending.  It is like to have to be restricted to about £40 a week; not as low as previously, but the EFG's regime is not cheap and must be continued.  There will be no other spending on anything as usual - books, shoes, clothes, household stuff, leisure, etc - the usual cutbacks!  Shopping at the Co-op helps as I can shop there on any of the three afternoons on which I pick the girls up from school and I don't need to make a special trip or even go out of my way as I drive right past it.  I'll keep you up to date with the ups and downs when I can!"},
{"title": "Changes in priorities", "date": "Wednesday 22 February 2012", "text": "The EFG has been diagnosed with PCOS and insulin resistance, so we are giving a high protein, low carb and sugar free diet a try.  This is having a little impact on the grocery budget, and the fuel budget in the short term whilst we are travelling more often to appointments here, there and everywhere.  The other thing that we have to think about is that the EFG really would like to go to Sixth Form in Cambridge, which is not our local opportunity.  That means that we get no help whatsoever with the travel costs.  Her options are four hours a day on various buses, or a daily hour and 10 minutes on a train and a shuttle bus from the station to the college.  The bus is half the price of the train, but I can't in all honesty force her to spend that many hours on a bus each day - she would be exhausted, and lose hours of valuable time.  So, I am looking at £1880 a year for a season ticket for two years.  Luckily, I'd get a couple of years' respite before the YFG would be needing the same, I should think. So there is now going to be a major revamp of the budget, and once this year's holiday is paid for, the savings will be directed towards a travel fund..."},
{"title": "Fenland Voices", "date": "Monday 20 February 2012", "text": "A man came to preach yesterday at the chapel.  He has been many times before, and I have met up with him at several of the preachers' meetings, so I have had the opportunity to get to know him better.  His family has been in this village for many generations, and their names are inscribed on memorial plaques, so they number amongst the honoured dead here as well as having many living members.  I'll call him Mr B.  He is an older gentleman, and has been leading services for about 50 years now, he told me.  He didn't go through the course I am undertaking at the moment, as it is a relatively new direction for Local Preachers.  He took services for some time and then had to have a talk with a superintendent, who passed him fit to preach without supervision.   Mr B was probably only about 18 when he began taking services as a favour to a friend who needed someone to take a service in a bit of an emergency!God shines through Mr B.  He reads the Bible and preaches without notes beyond what he has scribbled in the margins of his ancient Bible.  He takes a service most weeks in the circuit and explained to me that he spends several evenings each week just preparing for each service, reading the texts in the Bible, commentaries and books by others, to be able to put together a sermon to share God's word with each congregation that he visits.Why talk about Mr B today?  Well, he said something in his Fen accent yesterday which reminded me of something a young mother in the village had said about this accent.  Mr B had cause to say the word \"human\" yesterday.  That \"u\" sounds more like \"oo\" in the Fens and so we heard \"hoo-man\" and I instantly thought of the mum who had heard her child say \"moo-sic\" instead of \"music\" and been mortified that her child would grow up to develop a Fen accent.  The mum is from another area of the country which has a distinctive accent, and perhaps she would prefer the child to speak that way, but the child lives in the Fens, and will go to school and live amongst others here who speak that way.Does it really matter?  I am something of an accent chameleon, able to moderate the way I speak in order to fit in with the company I am in, and I think that a lot of people are like that. I have always done that and seem to do it automatically - I don't think about it!  In Scotland, I soon picked up phrases and changes to verb placement in the sentences and used them quite easily without thinking about it!  It was as easy to stop speaking in that way the minute I came back to live in England and was no longer surrounded by people speaking like that.I don't think that accents are important in the grand scheme of things, and the comment I made to the FH yesterday is that if that child grows up to be half the person that Mr B is, she will do well, however she speaks!"},

I feel hard done by tonight, as I wanted to watch the BBC programme about the Queen which Andrew Marr has made.  It is a three part programme and this is week 2.I missed it last week as the FH was watching a programme about soldiers in Afghanistan, which the girls didn't want to watch, so they were in my bed watching something else on that tv. Exactly the same scenario has developed tonight.The options which would enable me to watch that programme about the Queen would all cost me money.  I could install BTVision, so I could record it; I could upgrade my internet package so that I could watch it on iPlayer without exceeding my monthly limit; I could buy it on DVD; I could buy another TV!!I am cross that I feel like my choices are the least important, and that makes me feel like spending money to make me feel more important.  BUT I won't, because although that would help me win the battle, I wouldn't win the war.  The war is on spending unnecessarily, and all of those options are unnecessary, so instead, I need to work on my feelings.  Easier said than done."},

All that has had to be found a home, as well as the things I bought from Sainsbury's.  There has been a lot of gym going on (Tues, Wed, Fri & Sat), some school meetings, a lot of taxi-ing children around, and some cooking.  Some, not a lot!This week is half-term and the children are off all week.  We have a day out planned on Tuesday when we will probably go to see my dad, and maybe pop to the cinema as well as he lives within shouting distance of our local Cineworld.  We haven't planned much because of the interesting weather we are having here at the moment.My lovely Fabia is ill.  The windscreen wipers died overnight; they were working fine yesterday but this morning they are as dead as the proverbial Dodo.  Cue a trip to the garage tomorrow because we have done all we can to sort it, which amounts to checking the fuse!  Fuse is fine so it is beyond us.Mount Washmore is piled up on the landing.  Three loads have been done tonight, and two are decorating the airers near the fire, but the third will have to wait for morning and hope for sunshine so I can hang it out in the verandah.    More will have to be done tomorrow.I read on someone's Facebook status yesterday that it is just six weeks until we change the clocks - I can't wait!!Dreamer has tagged me on her blog and now I have to answer some questions!  Apparently I have to tag more people and post a set of questions of my own for them.  One set at a time, so I'll start with the questions I have been asked:How many siblings do you have and what was your position in the family?  For my mum, I was the elder daughter, and for my dad, I am the middle daughter.  In my family, I have the position of the elder daughter.  I'm not taking the lid off that particular can of worms.Do you still keep in touch with your best friend from school days? Yes, I do.  I met her when I was 9, so this September marks 30 years of friendship.  We kept in touch through attending different secondary schools, being together very intensively for 2 years whilst we did A levels at the same school, and then going to universities at opposite ends of the UK.  Now she has a boy and a girl, and lives about 20 miles away.  We talk on the phone every couple of months, but she needs me a lot less now than she did back then, and the pattern of our relationship has changed, although I love her no less.Girly shoes or walking boots? Walking boots every day.What would you choose for a last meal? Chicken and bacon casserole with root veg and mash followed by self saucing chocolate pudding.  No question.If you could go back in time which era would you like to have been born in? I would have liked to have known my great grandfather, and to have known my grandmother when she was a younger woman, so the early part of the last century - the 1910s to the 1930s.  What is the one possession you would think about running back into a burning building for? You know, I don't think I would.  I hold my memories in my head, and everyTHING else is replaceable one way or another.  I'd be in there like a shot for my family though, if they were stuck.What is your favourite colour to wear?  Royal blue and navy blueWhat is your favourite colour to decorate with? Pink and green Do you like to grow flowers or vegetables in your garden? Vegetables - you can't eat flowers.  BUT I was harangued for not having flowers for the bees so I planted a lavender hedge about 5 years ago and now it is in desperate need of a drastic trim!Are you a cat or a dog person?  I would be a dog person if I got the chance.Who would you like to be stuck in a lift with?  I don't do lifts if I can help it all, and I definitely wouldn't like to be stuck with anyone in particular!I'm not sure what Blogger is up to with those colours changing from blue to black, but those questions are actually quite challenging!  I shall consider my own questions and post those this week, and tag some of my favourite blogs too.  It's all good fun!!"},
{"title": "Dads are special", "date": "Monday 6 February 2012", "text": "(image from www.onewed.com)I've been having a chat with my dad tonight.  He almost made me cry telling me how proud he  is of me for what I am doing in the church these days, and how  he thinks of his grandfather and believes that he would be pleased to see his great granddaughter follow in his footsteps.I don't think I have ever really fallen out with my dad.  There haven't been any long silences between us, no real periods of discord.  It is a very different and more placid relationship than that which I had with my mother - that was definitely more volatile, but no less loving.Dad is a peacemaker, like me, and forgiving, like me!  We want everyone to get on.  He was in his forties when I was born and he wasn't a particularly hands-on Dad, but he has developed a different and perhaps stronger relationship with me as an adult daughter, and one which I cherish.  Not having Mum around for the last 14 years has been hard on all of us, and I think that a lot of things would have been different if she had still been alive, but we have a positive outlook on life, and those of us who choose to spend time together enjoy doing so.Dad is also building strong relationships with his granddaughters.  I see that he is also immensely proud of them, of the young ladies that they are becoming and the achievements they are making all the time.  He is impressed with the EFG's grasp of technology, and he is amazed at the YFG and her gymnastic ability - no one in the family has done gym before!(Photograph from telegraph.co.uk)Today is the actual day, 60 years on, which marks the Accession of HM Queen Elizabeth II to the throne.Whether you are a royalist or not, I don't think you can doubt this lady's devotion to her duty and to her countries.  Her popularity has waxed and waned over the years, but I think that people will turn out to support her in this Jubilee Year.I remember her Silver Jubilee back in 1977 when I was just 5.  She came to Cambridge to open Wolfson College and the whole school trekked across Cambridge to \"see\" her - I got a glimpse of a shiny car and that was that!!  We did spend time making Jubilee scrapbooks that term, and we all had an emblem of something royal on the front - a crown, a state coach, etc - as a silhouette.We are going to be on holiday in June when all the official celebrations in London take off, and I don't know whether anything is planned here in the village, but we will be in Bridlington, so we'll have to see what is going on up there instead."},
{"title": "Struggling through the snow", "date": "Sunday 5 February 2012", "text": "When I woke up this morning and peeped through the curtains, I saw the blanket of snow covering the ground and thought how beautiful it was.  It was pristine, with just one set of tyre tracks on the road where someone had left the estate earlier.  The tracks we made coming home last night had been long covered up.  The YFG came downstairs when she heard me about, and her first question was about the snow, \"Is it still there?\" as she had been too afraid to look out herself in case it had all disappeared in the night - that would have been a tremendous disappointment to her!Since I really don't like to drive in the snow, and we have got 4 or 5 inches here, she and I decided that we would walk to church this morning.  The FH thought we were mad and declined to join us, but it felt wrong to stay at home when I knew that the preacher was going to come out from Wesley House in Cambridge.  If he could make it through the snow all that way, I was jolly sure I was going to make it a mile up the road even on foot.  We managed, and it took about 25 minutes as it was quite hard going through the deep snow.  We had a good service and it was worth going.  A gentleman with a 4x4 kindly gave us a lift home to the top of the road so that was easier coming home.I cooked toad in the hole for lunch and then promptly fell asleep for about 90 minutes!  Later on, the YFG and I cleared the snow from the front pathway and around my car in case I need to go anywhere tomorrow - although I really hope I don't!!  The EFG has been out with a friend on the green, snowballing one another, and the YFG is out now at a friend's house, making a snowman.  It is dark now though, so I hope she'll be home soon.An excellent evening on the tv tonight with Countryfile, Call the Midwife and Wild at Heart, just perfect to accompany a heap of ironing.  Keep warm and I'll pop back tomorrow."},

We have been out to church to a family concert in which the FGs took part with some other girls from the congregation.  As we left the house at 6pm, snow flakes were just visible in the light from the streetlamps.  When we came out of the church at 9.30pm, there were several inches of snow on the ground!!  I had to drive home and so we crept along at a very sedate 20mph - very good job we weren't going very far...It was a lovely evening, and now we are all round the fire, getting warm before we head off to bed.It is still snowing."},

{"title": "End of the month", "date": "Tuesday 31 January 2012", "text": "We made it to the end of the month - hooray!  I will have a proper round up of the finances tomorrow when I have had a look through them.  I am very pleased (and the FH is extremely chuffed) that we have bought the car and are financially no worse off really, which is a major achievement for us.  The car is a pleasure to drive, goes really well, and I hope it will prove to be economical to run - the tax disc is cheaper, to start with, and the diesel should outperform petrol in the miles per gallon stakes.  The storecupboards are looking bare, though, and I will have to re-stock them over the next week or so - it is typical of me that I had those cupboards groaning before Christmas, absolutely full of food to get us through a tough winter, I believed, when the snow would lay thick on the ground and I would not have to traipse to the shops!  The winter has been really mild, the stores have been depleted - and guess what? Those really cold days, with the chance of snow?  They are coming this week!!   I am still trying to use stuff up, but the staples like rice, pasta, UHT milk, jam, etc are running out, and so the shopping list will have to go up on the board, and the trip to the shops made.  But which shop?  I'm not sure that I want to darken the door of Tesco again, but do I cut off my nose to spite my face, so to speak, by not taking advantage of the offers they have?  Perhaps I should travel a few more miles and support Morrisons and check out their new M range...don't know yet.  Will think about this one more - what do you think?Hope you are all OK and warm in this chilly weather - we have the fire alight and it is warm and cosy in the sitting room.

{"title": "The rules don't change", "date": "Monday 30 January 2012", "text": "I have just been having a look through one of the issues of the Tightwad Gazette compendiums which I bought years ago - I have all three of them although I know that a bind-up is available as a single volume.  The one I was looking at had been published back in 1995, about 17 years ago.  Amy Dacyczyn wrote a newsletter for six years on a monthly basis, whilst raising six children.  She had a clear set of goals in mind, and the books are well worth reading (from the library, of course!).  I found her books inspirational at the beginning of this journey to live well on little, and still have them all together on the bookshelf; they are invaluable for a boost now and again.  The thing which is so useful is that whilst there are plenty of tips, AD talks about the bigger picture.  She is more of the \"teach a man to fish and he can feed his family for a lifetime\" school of thought, so the ideas are broad reaching and fundamental.  The recipes are few and far between, for example, but the Master Muffin recipe is excellent.  She puts together a guideline for how to balance a selection of ingredients in order to create your own muffin recipe, based on what you have in stock, what is cheap where you live, and what your family likes.Watching an interview with AD here, made after she retired from the newsletter to concentrate on family life, she seems content and happy, her kids are older and some have left home, but she is still passionate that this is the best way to live.  Putting it at its most simple, I gleaned these rules from our earliest studies of her work, and these are the ones we still use:Save money - save as much as you can, as often as you can!Spend less than you have - set a budget and live within it - don't spend what you don't have.  Watch what you spend - record your spending, and keep track of what you are spending on what.  Look for patterns, change the patterns if they are not good ones!  Check for deals on everything, buy when sales are on!If you can do it yourself, it will save you money - so we would grow vegetables when we can, not buy prepackaged vegetables and salads, no ready meals, no takeaways; we also decorate the house ourselves (although it tends not to be that often!).  The FH and UJ also practise this principle in their gardening and DIY, saving screws from salvaged wood, recycling items for new purposes, etc.  Making cakes and bakes from scratch is a given - I wouldn't buy a packet mix for a cake.Combine to save - combine journeys so that each mile makes the most use of the petrol pound, so to speak.  Do all the shopping, library and banking visits on the same day that you have to go to town for the piano lesson, for example, rather than going back on a separate occasion.  Combine ownership with relatives - we have the use of a cement mixer, a set of draining rods, a holiday home, and a rotavator, even though we don't actually own any of them.  Similarly, we would lend out anything that a friend or relative needed to borrow if we had what they needed.  Combine uses - don't acquire gadgets which only do one thing!  Multi purpose items are far more cost effective and useful.Get creative - make things.  Make gifts individual and special so that it doesn't matter that they are home made, they become hand-crafted!  Don't pander to snooty relatives and friends who turn up their noses at such offerings.  If home made jam is acceptable to HM The Queen, it is good enough for Aunty Joan...Make your own rules and stick to them: Rules can vary between the price you are willing to pay for a family holiday, and how often, to your take on overnight school trips (they are a no for us - saves arguments and shocking prices for short trips).  But it is key that they OUR rules and we are not swayed by either the media or so called friends trying to persuade us to do something we don't want to do.  The girls know that we have a family rule that they do not go on school trips which involve overnight stays - so they have not been to a gallery trip to Liverpool, on a New York half term trip, on a battlefields trip, etc.  We have done galleries in Cambridge instead, and she didn't study History at GCSE so the battlefields wasn't missed, and New York?  Well, New York will still be there when they are old enough to decide for themselves.  And that rule is not entirely financially motivated.  Don't automatically buy it new.    Look for a bargain.  When we lived in a town and walked everywhere, I was always popping into the myriad charity shops that were everywhere!  I dressed the girls, myself and the FH mostly in charity shop finds, as well as buying other bits and pieces like duvet covers, bedspreads, books, jigsaws, etc.  The FH has a pair of Church's shoes worth over £200 which set him back about £4 from a charity shop. Those were the days.  Now we live so far from town that when we go to town, we are usually armed with a list of things to do already that there is no time to potter around the half dozen charity shops.  That sort of thing is best done several times a week, I found, popping in on the off-chance to see what had come in.  That doesn't work for us now, so our charity shop finds are fewer, although I love a good browse when we are on holiday.  Our shopping strategy has changed somewhat: I now keep a mental list of who needs what, and I watch online sales closely.  When Hawkshead announce a sale, I know that perhaps the EFG needs a new fleece, and I look to see what might be on offer; I remember that Asda's George trousers fit the YFG well, so we notice when they have a sale on and pick up a pair on offer.  Shoes are our biggest problem with their wide feet and I am still working on an effective strategy for those, until we move the beach somewhere hot and they can go barefoot permanently!!These strategies and rules have kept us in the black for the twenty years we have been together.  I am fortunate in that I married another tightwad-type and not a spendthrift.  Perhaps having a similar attitude and outlook on life has helped more than anything else, because it has meant continuous support and encouragement in the whole project all these years.  If I had had to do it alone, and been fighting someone who wanted to spend as much as I am driven to save, I think it would have been impossible.  Well, perhaps not impossible, but much much more difficult.Do we live a miserable, small life, though, with no joy and not a scrap of fun?  No.  Not at all.  We have holidays and days out, we go to the cinema (Tesco Clubcard vouchers), we buy DVDs and have technology (ipod and Kindle, laptops etc), we do gymnastics, the EFG is starting Hockey club this week, and none of us starve!  We run two cars, live in a 4 bedroom house, and support too many chickens and half a dozen rabbits.  There are other ways we could cut back but choose not to at the moment.It is all about moderation, appropriate behaviour, and keeping it all in perspective.  It is a challenge, a game, on one hand, but I do not in any way make light of the seriousness of the situations of people who have to do this to scrape from one week to the next.  Part of me is saving like mad to keep a safety net in the pot so that I can avoid that situation when the time comes.  The plans are in hand but things take time to happen and we can't see the future - we have to trust that we are doing our best for the people we care about and love.  A warm welcome to new visitors and friends - lovely to have you popping in!"},

{"title": "Savings success", "date": "Wednesday 25 January 2012", "text": "Tomorrow we are going to pick up my new-to-us Skoda Fabia (a black 2005 version of the car above) and I have just been doing some calculations to see what its purchase has done to the family fortunes.I sold the Vectra for £500 so that is in hand to go towards the Fabia.  The Fabia is costing me £1500, so a balance of £1000 has been required to be found.Today I went to the bank to withdraw that money, so that I can pay the owner the cash in the morning.  Tonight, I have been looking at the figures, and have just given the FH the good news:Due to all the savings, the challenges, the sales of the DVDs, the YouGov contribution and the scrimping I have done in January, although I have just withdrawn £1000 from the bank, we are only actually £144 worse off than we were at the beginning of the month.Result!  I am fairly sure I can recoup that in February....watch this space!Life gets in the way of blogging, occasionally!  Sorry to have kept you hanging on...The confessions?  Well, last weekend I went to Tesco.  Personally, that feels like a failure in the challenge, as it meant that I spent way more than the £21 a week limit, and there were lots of offers on!  The spending on groceries amounted to £29.20 and brought the total for last week to £55.34 - whoops indeed.What did I buy? What were the temptations? Why did I even go in?There were some certain feminine products we needed, and at 8pm on a Friday night, there are a limited number of places to buy them.  We ended up buying a selection of other things of which we had run out:S R flour 52psquash (3 bottles) £3.74Weetabix (offer - £1/box) £2.00sunflower oil £1.39Baking margerine £2.89 (1kg)UHT milk (4@49p) £1.96Frozen mixed peppers (2) £2.00Pack reduced bananas 28pBacon (2 for £4) £4.00Pink salmon (offer - half price) 4 @ £1.34 =  £5.36Mango £1.50Sausages £2.56Twix pack £1.00The thing with doing these back-to-back challenges is that one runs out of standard stock cupboard items, and then only replaces them if absolutely necessary.  There is no budget for stockpiling this cupboard, and this affects the long-term budget.  For example, the salmon in the list above - I can make a selection of dishes which will feed us for a main meal with the salmon as the main ingredient - that is cheap at £1.34 when compared with, for example, a meat-based dish which could easily cost £1 per person or more, just for the meat part of the dish.  By stocking up on salmon when it is on offer like this, I am able to put together these cheaper meals and reduce the amount spent on meals those days.  If I don't buy the salmon because it is a challenge week, I am hampering myself on those other days.  Do you see?We have just 6 days to go to the end of the month, and I am still convinced that these challenges work, since the amount I have spent overall on food this month so far has been less than £97.  This is still a success, even though it is a few pounds over the £84 which would have been 4 times the £21 set.  I anticipate that by the weekend, I may have spent about another £5 on fruit and veg, but we'll see!Being given a lot of leeks this month has helped no end as we are eating a lot of leek and potato soup for lunchtimes at home, and I have served it with baguette as an evening meal twice.  It has also set me back on the straight and narrow as regards my breakfasts - there is a huge container of oats in the pantry, so I am enjoying porridge for breakfast each day - lots of goodness in there!It has also been a boon this month that the hens have begun to lay again, so there have been no purchases of eggs.  I am not \"buying\" them from myself, although that might have been a consideration in some methods."},

There was a huge stash of things from AF and Rosspa which came before Christmas which were \"lunchbox-designated\" and they have now munched their way through it all.  They will take home made things in their boxes, but they do like a packet of crisps now and again.  Or a KitKat, perhaps, especially when in need of a chocolate hit!!  I don't want to spend a big lump of money on the delivery of an AF/Rosspa order this month, so I am plodding along, picking up bits for them here and there.  We had run out of carrots as well - and the YFG does enjoy a chopped carrot in her lunchbox (she can't bite it because of the braces she is wearing).So, it looks like this:Crisps (2 multipacks on offer) £1.80Weetabix (chocolate ones) (24) £2.00Loaf 0.83Red Leicester cheese £2.97Carrots (reduced) 0.35Bananas £1.26The total is £9.21 - which would have been within budget if I hadn't bought the sack of potatoes, so I am saying no more!!This the culmination of some of the cooking today - the girls had the salmon quiche, the baguette and some baked beans for their tea.They love the baguette, and like the flavour of the quiche, although they mentioned that they weren't so keen on the texture.  It was a crustless quiche.These are the little sticky buns I made with a sweet dough for the after school rush to piano.  In the car I have the two FGs but also the YFG's friend who also has a piano lesson, so I always take three of anything and she is very appreciative of home made goodies.  They all like these!  There were 12 to start with, and I have managed to stash 4 for tomorrow....Baguettes came out beautifully as usual.  A dozen plain scones to the fab Paul H recipe I mentioned last week or so. I've hidden them away - some in a tin and some in the freezer.  They are fine for a couple of days, we have found, if they are slightly warmed before serving with lashings of raspberry jam!And this was the salmon quiche, cooling on the windowsill so that I could put it in the fridge!  Have you baked today?  Do you bake at all?  I know some people don't have the time during the week so perhaps the weekend is their baking time...Happy baking!  Good for the purse, if not the waistline."},

These sunset views really give you an impression of the size of the landscapes out here, and those huge Fen skies.  On a clear day, we can see across the fields for miles!  This one is on the edge of the village.This one is out of the village on the road to the town.  We pass through about 6 miles of this kind of open space before we get to a slightly more inhabited area for a couple of miles before we hit town.  Plenty of fields - several full of leeks at the moment, although there are lots of hard working people out there in all weathers up to their knees in mud, picking them this week!  The air smells of leeks as we drive along the road."},
{"title": "Grocery Challenge update", "date": "Wednesday 18 January 2012", "text": "Today I had to make a trip to town to take a friend home who had come out to the village on the bus.  The EFG hitched a ride as she wanted to buy a small gift for a friend's birthday, so we went to Sainsbury's.I could kick myself as I forgot to buy the self raising flour which was too expensive in the Co-op!!I did make some purchases though, and just about used up this week's money, but do bear those potatoes in mind, and be kind!  I may go over this week...but I am going to really try not to.Spending:Gluten-free flour £1.75Clover spread £1.00Mushrooms £1.00Parsnips 0.63 (for two parsnips for tea tonight)An organic cucumber £1.30 (The YFG wanted it to go in her sandwiches for school - I only let them have home-grown or organic because I don't like the way normal cucumbers are grown)All that comes to £5.68, leaving us £4.07 - I think the Sealed pot may go hungry from this week's grocery challenge money!How's your week going?Watching meters is an integral part of what happens to monitor spending.  There are some purchases that we don't make in a shop over a counter with a handful of cash.  Such transactions include our buying of water, electricity, piped gas and broadband.It is that last one which I am having the most trouble at the moment!  We have a package with BT which allows us 10GB of download each calendar month.  That has been fine each month since we joined back in the summer - we do usually use about 7 or 8GB a month, but not the full amount, so I thought we were doing fine with that package.Unfortunately, I received an email from BT to say that we had used 15GB in December, which was very surprising.  I also had another email from them to say that already in the month (on the 8th) we were projected to exceed the limit again this month!  Oh dear!So I have to start digging around.  I started with the HomeHub and found a device listed which was not one of ours - as it was called \"neighbourandhiswife\" (insert their names) it was obviously theirs - so I phoned BT.  These people are not friends of ours, and they haven't been inside the house in the last 5 years, let alone the last 6 months since we have had this HomeHub, so there is no way that they could have seen the Hub stickers with the passwords on them.  So, passwords have been changed to longer configurations, and that device is on Access Control to limit the availability of the internet to them, should they get past the passwords again.I thought we had the situation under control, and I have been monitoring the usage daily with the handy meter on the website.  That was going fine, and we were back to 0.19 - 0.22GB a day which is fine.  Then last night's reading from the night before had shot up to 0.6GB!!!We have downloaded \"live\" meters to watch what uses the most, and we are checking the meter on the website daily, we are also trying to think about which websites may have been used on particular days.  The YFG has had a load of homework set on a website which the school uses, and she had 85 English exercises to do - we are wondering about this as she had done a chunk of them on the day we  recorded the 0.6GB, so I have sent an email to the school's IT dept to see what they know about it....I'll let you know as the investigation continues!  I really don't want to have to upgrade to a more expensive package but we have had the warning for going over the limit in December so we will be charged this month and every other month we exceed the limit."},

I had to take the YFG to the doctor's this morning about her lovely ganglion which has sort of disappeared, but the advice was minimal and almost a waste of an hour and a half.I have done some shopping, since I was in town, and passing the potato merchant:25kg sack of Picasso potatoes (highly recommended) £5.50At the Co-op:Two bags of apples (Russets, and Braeburns) £3.50Loaf of bread 0.831/2 lb mince, reduced £1.42The total grocery spend for today is £11.25 although it includes a bag of potatoes which will probably last us a month or more, but I am not going to get into a complicated system of \"buying\" a smaller quantity each week.  A chunk of this week's money has been spent and that is that!!That leaves £9.75 for any other spending needed this week....AND Mrs Mac's prize is on its way - it should make it to you within 7 working days, I am assured by the lady at the Post Office.

Less choice but less temptation...Having said that, I refused to pay over £1 for 1.5kg self raising flour the last time I was in the Co-op as I know that I can get it for 52p in Tesco - even Sainsbury's is likely to be cheaper that the Co-op!  I am therefore going to have to make a trip to one or t'other later this week.More chocolate traybake made today for the girls and their lunchboxes.  Mind you, I think that the YFG has had a couple of slices already.  She has been at home today with a headache and a pain behind her eyes - she used to get a lot of migraines so it was better to keep her off because once it develops, she gets pretty bad very quickly.  Thankfully she slept it off this morning, and when I came home from a meeting at school, she and the FH were watching a DVD and she was feeling better, so she will be back at school in the morning.Hope you are all doing well."},

{"title": "Counting the cost", "date": "Saturday 14 January 2012", "text": "I've made a sponge cake this evening, filled it with strawberry jam and put a sprinkling of caster sugar on the top.  It tastes scrumptious.  This is made with dairy free margerine and gluten free flour.  There are 8-10 portions here, depending on the portion sizes.Here are the two portions which the FH and I have just enjoyed - he does enjoy sampling the baking!So, I have thought tonight about the cost of making this cake.  All the supermarkets now do extensive (and expensive) ranges of \"free from\" bakes and cakes, biscuits, pasta, bread, etc.  These are very tempting and quite handy sometimes, but I have been trying to avoid them this month especially, because of the cost implications - for example, in the Sainsbury's range, 4 cherry bakewell cakes are £2 (50p each, obviously) and 4 chocolate brownies are £1.93 - 48p each for a tiny slice of (heavenly) chocolate cake that can be downed in three mouthfuls!!My sponge has cost me in the region of £1.85 for the ingredients:Vitalite dairy-free margerine @ £1.20 for 500g - I use 200g at 48pCaster sugar @ £1.79 for 1kg - I use 200g at 36pDove's Farm gluten-free flour @ £1.70 for 1kg - I use 200g at 34pEggs - this varies widely from 10p each for value ones to 25p each for Free Range, but I sell my eggs to friends and neighbours at £1 for 6 so this costs 67p for this recipe.Making this with \"normal\" ingredients for the family would only alter the margerine price to 36p, and the flour price to 7p based on Tesco value self-raising flour at 52p for 1.5kg.A sponge made for the family with these ingredients would cost £1.46.Today I filled my sponge with \"free\" strawberry jam which UJ gave me - it is lovely!!So I can compare a one-tenth portion of my cake costing me about 18.5p with a cherry bakewell for 50p - and I know which I'd rather have - the home made one every time!!"},

We also have some potatoes and onions left, and plenty of tinned beans and tinned tomatoes, so please don't think that we aren't eating healthily on this challenge!

{"title": "Time and money in the freezer", "date": "Thursday 12 January 2012", "text": "Last week the YFG wanted tuna pasta for her tea, so I made rather a large batch - bit too much really!  Before starting this Grocery Challenge, I would have chucked the leftovers to the chickens, perhaps, or put them in the bin.  But this time, I divided the leftovers between two little foil containers and stashed them in the freezer.Cue last night.  Two hungry girls coming home from Guides after everyone else had eaten, and it was easy to pull the two portions from the freezer, zap them in the microwave and their tea was ready!  Saved money - saved time - result!!  Now I need to turn my attention to perking up their lunchboxes - the YFG has gone off this morning with a Special K bar, a chopped apple, a chopped carrot, a frozen Frube and a packet of crisps.  The crisps and SK bar came from AF so didn't cost a lot, and the Frubes were bought cheaply as they were close to their use-by date, but I froze them so they are OK.  I wish that there wasn't so much \"bought\" stuff in there, and that she would take a sandwich or a wrap or a roll, but she doesn't seem to want those and always moans about them :-( There's definitely work to do in that department!  The EFG isn't quite so bad but is stuck in her ways a little and likes the same things day-in day-out so gets huffy if I run out or don't buy the same things.  I need to talk with her about variety being the spice of life and all that!!"},

Gym hadn't resumed and there was still little pressure on us to be anywhere or do anything specific.Monday morning brought life back to a more normal schedule with a bit of a bang!  School is really cranking up the gears as the EFG approaches a season of GCSE exams all coming together, with final assessments due to be completed and exams on the horizon, so she is working harder than ever.  She's always worked hard but they are really piling it on now, and she has to stay to a couple of after school sessions now and again, to help with the time available to complete art and English assessments.The YFG is back at gymnastics as of last night, and piano lessons, so her extra-curricular stuff is also off the ground again.  She is struggling with a ganglion on her hand which hurts a little when she does handstands and cartwheels, so she is wearing a support on her hand and we have another appointment with the doctor next week.  Last Friday we were at the orthodontist in Cambridge and she was happy to hear that the braces will be coming off within the next two appointments, so the light at the end of that particular tunnel is definitely in sight.I am really trying to get into a housekeeping routine which is getting off to a little bit of a slow start although I did spring clean the ensuite on Monday, so I guess that is a place to start, and something to build on.  I am trying very hard to make sure that the kitchen is clean and the surfaces clear before bed each night.And the Grocery Challenge?  Yes, I am still keeping up with this; there was a small spend yesterday so that I could restock a couple of items we were out of so here we are:Skim milk powder (an ingredient in my baguette recipe) £2.25Buttery spread £1.35Vitalite (Dairy-free for me) £2.00 (for two, on offer)Tea bags £1.00So that total was £6.60, leaving £14.40 for the rest of the week.There is still loads of meat in the freezer so there will be no need to buy any this week and the large sack of Picasso potatoes is half-full.  The store cupboard is still looking healthy so I am fairly confident we will make it through the month on this regime.  If you are doing a similar challenge, do share how you are getting on, and what problems you are encountering.  For me, now that school and all its associated activities are back on, it is finding the time for all the baking and cooking from scratch that has to be done.  I do enjoy it, but this afternoon I have school meetings and then the EFG will be volunteering at Brownies from 6pm and then the YFG will be out as well as she goes to Guides at 7.30pm - both need to be picked up at 9pm so there are only small windows of opportunity to get things done."},
{"title": "Economical energy", "date": "Sunday 8 January 2012", "text": "We bought the new mini-oven in Lidl's on Thursday because I had seen it recommended on Frugal Queen's blog, and having had the energy monitor for several months now, I have become aware of how much electricity the main oven uses.This afternoon, I cooked the scone pudding, some roast potatoes and a half-batch of scones for tomorrow's lunchboxes.  Whereas the energy monitor would have been up in the high 40s or low 50s if I had had the main oven on, the mini oven never pushed the monitor beyond 18p/hour.  And it wasn't the only thing on - there was a tv, 2 laptops and a couple of lights on as well!The roast potatoes were pretty scrummy!And there are just enough scones left for the lunchboxes as they have been tested!Friday night was baking night here in the Fens, and I cooked up a storm, as they say!  A sponge cake, the French baguettes, pizzas, and Paul Hollywood scones (two links there - one to tell you who he is, and one to the recipe).   The scones are pretty good, the folks say, but they do need to be eaten the day they are made, and since I didn't make them until the evening, they didn't all get eaten.  Today I have recycled those that were left to make a type of bread-and-butter pudding but with the scones as the base instead of bread.  They had risen up quite well, so I was able to slice through each one to make three pieces, which I then buttered and put a layer in the bottom of a dish.  A handful of mixed dried fruit and half a tablespoon of brown sugar finished the first layer off.Another layer of buttered scones and then more fruit and sugar.I sprinkled a sachet of the instant value custard powder over the base and then poured over some ever-so-slightly out-of-date double cream which had been mixed with four beaten eggs and a drop or two of milk.  This made the custard.I thought this would be ideal for trying out the new mini-oven, and it fitted just perfectly into the oven space.  200C for about half an hour and it smelt gorgeous!And this is the finished product.  The folks have eaten half of it for supper tonight, and then the rest is stashed in the fridge for tomorrow.

Each one is rolled out to a rectangle about 10\" long and 3-4\" wide.  I fold them over into thirds and place them on the special baguette rack with the overlap underneath.Then I set them in the living room where the FH had helpfully lit the fire and they rise in about 4 5 minutes.Perfectly puffed up and I sprinkle with a little more flour for a rustic look!After about 20 minutes in the oven, I wrap them in a clean tea-towel so that they don't overdo the crustiness!The ingredients:300ml water1 tsp salt2 tbsp milk powder2 tbsp oil1 tbsp sugar500g strong bread flour2tsp yeast - I use Dove's Farm quick yeast.The baguette tray came from Amazon a few years ago."},

{"title": "Cheese scones", "date": "Thursday 5 January 2012", "text": "Fresh out of the oven last nightThe girls love these cheese scones, especially warm spread with a little butter!  Naughty but very nice, apparently.  The YFG had a few last night and they both had them for breakfast this morning - I doubt that there are many left in the tin this morning!I have had this recipe handwritten in my recipe notebook for some years, and am afraid that I do not remember where it came from - it may have come from a book, a website or a blog.  First:Put 1lb of self-raising flour, 2 tsp baking powder, a pinch of salt, and 1 tsp mustard powder into a large bowl and mix them together.  Preheat the oven to 200C, and get out two baking trays.Rub 8oz of cold margerine into the dry ingredients, and then stir in 8oz grated cheese and finally mix it all together with 8fl oz milk.  It will come together into one large ball of dough.  Make sure it is all incorporated, but do not over handle it.Cut the ball into two pieces, and take one out and put onto a floured surface.  Pat it down with your hands into a large flat circle, about 3/4 of an inch thick.  Using a sharp knife, cut the circle into 8 wedges and place them onto a baking tray.  Use a little more grated cheese to top them, and then bake for about 15 minutes.  Do the same with the other ball of dough.  Allow them to cool and then keep in an airtight tin.  They have never lasted longer than a day or two here, but they can be frozen."},

The FH will be taking the YFG to her piano lesson tomorrow and whilst she is in there, he will need to pop to the shops as I am building up a little shopping list of things I am running out of which we need to replace!I have made cheese scones tonight as the YFG wanted them for her lunchbox tomorrow - but she has scoffed at least three since she got home from her Guides meeting tonight.  Because I made those, I need more cheese...I watched a new cookery programme tonight which was amazing - The Fabulous Baker Brothers.  It was on Channel 4 at 8.30pm, and I would definitely try to see it again next week. Click on my link and it will take you to an info page from where you can go to the recipes as well - they made some really yummy looking \"sticky sticks\" which are like long thin doughnuts which they fried, rolled in sugar and then dipped in fresh chocolate sauce!!  Kind of wish we lived in Gloucestershire!The store cupboards in the garage are well stocked and look a little different now from how they did back when we first put them there.  This picture is the bottom of the second one, and has lots of home made pickles, as well as tinned fruit and peas, enchilada kits, biscuits, crisps, cat litter and a few sweets.This is the top half of that second cupboard, and has most of our home made jams, marmalades and pickles here.  The tinned meat and fish are also in this area, as well as noodles, sauces and spreads.This is the first cupboard that featured in the original post.  This one houses the various flours in those storage boxes, UHT milk, icing sugar, rice, pasta, squash and juices, spare spices, pasta sauces and suet, and soups.  The baked beans, vinegar and Camp coffee also find their home here.I think we are fairly well stocked in this kind of goods, and I buy things when they are on offer, when I find them on the Approved Food or Rosspa websites, and I really try not to run out of things!  We have a mini blackboard in the kitchen and the idea is that once we start using the last of something, we write it down on the board so that we know we need more.  Saying that, I try to keep a handle on what we have and how many we have, so that if I see something at a good price, I know whether it would be good to buy a few, even if we haven't actually officially run out!I do keep the garage locked up as the chicken food is also stored in here, and I would hate to lose any of it all!!The kitchen has had a spruce up over the weekend, and I was so pleased, I took some photos!Just a few of the cookbooks are stored here - the ones I use the most often - and the huge pink folder is full of recipes downloaded from my favourite websites.  I use it a lot!The gas hob is very useful - there is no mains gas in the village so when there is a power cut, I am one of the few people on the estate who can cook and boil a whistling kettle so some of my friends come round for a cuppa occasionally.  What with the gas hob and the woodburner, power cuts don't bother us too badly!"},
{"title": "Budgeting for 2012", "date": "Monday 2 January 2012", "text": "I've spent an hour or two this evening working on our household budget for the year.  I've been realistic in all departments and based this year's figures on what we spent on each thing last year. But I am hoping to make more savings in some areas this time, and be able to save some of the budget, so each figure should be a maximum for the year, and the aim would be to have some left over to transfer to savings.I have set up a big spreadsheet so that I can keep track of the monthly spending in each area of the budget, and I have a new diary where I am recording every penny we spend this year.  Today has been a day at home so I have been able to record a No Spend Day.So, in accordance with tradition here, January is a Low-Spend month.  I will be doing four back to back $21 challenges but changing the amount to £21 - this is the amount I am allowed to spend each week to supplement what we have in stock for the menu - it is usually spent on fresh fruit and veg, cheese and things like that.  There will be no spending on frivolities and luxuries and it will really be a month of living on what we have got!  Hopefully it will kick start the savings.My aim is to save £5000 this year,  as I fell short of this target in 2011 by quite a way.  We have made a start on the decluttering by packing up a load of old DVDs to send to musicmagpie and I donated 10 items of clothing I no longer want to a recycling bin yesterday!  We have to start somewhere!!"},

{"title": "Enjoying the break", "date": "Wednesday 28 December 2011", "text": "We had a fairly quiet day on Christmas, but then the visitors started coming!!  UJ was here by 12 on Boxing Day and the FH wasn't even up - lucky for me, I had been up a while and started on the chores.  Lunch was just going to be cold meat and mash with pickles anyway, so there wasn't a lot to do.  In the afternoon, the first gang of cousins came - three of them.  I made some French sticks to add to the spread for tea - it was a kind of buffet affair, with bread, cheese, crackers, ham, pork pies, crisps, lettuce, tomatoes, dips and side salads, pickles, etc, and then mince pies and fruit cake for the sweet course.  We had to have crackers too!That was a fun evening, and we didn't have the tv on all day until we watched The Borrowers on BBC at 7.30pm.  The cousins left at about 9pm after telling us lots of new (and not so new!) jokes, helping the FH with his puzzle and enjoying lots of chatting and catching up.  It was good.Yesterday (Tuesday) another family - my cousin and aunt and uncle - came in the afternoon and UJ came back to meet up with them, since the visiting uncle is his brother and they rarely see each other!  My mum was their sister - one was older than her, one younger.  We had another similar spread for tea, but they left slightly earlier at just after 7pm.  UJ stayed a little later, helping the FH with the puzzle again, and it was another good day.Today, the FH had been planning to take some of his lunch club mates out for lunch somewhere as the lunch club is closed for two weeks, but one of the mates is in hospital after a fall on Monday (he's nearly 90) and another was feeling under the weather with a heavy cold, so they didn't go this week.  He has inspected the inside of his eyelids a lot today, although he would disagree!! The puzzle is coming along nicely, though, and that keeps him occupied but I know he is itching to get back out into the workshop and get on.I have prepared this Sunday's service today; I'm a bit nervous about this one as I haven't even attended a service at this particular chapel, let alone led a service there.  I have spoken to a lady I know there who is a Worship Leader there and she is being very helpful and will meet me on Sunday and show me where everything is.  She promises me that they are very laid back there, so I hope that they are forgiving too!!  I just need to ring someone else with the hymn numbers tomorrow and I'm all set.  This is the last service I will need to take until February so I will have January to get started on the 4th unit of the Faith & Worship course - I had a look through it today and it is heavy going.  I will definitely have to set time aside to get on with it.  A unit a month as the tutor suggested looks overly ambitious to me at this stage.Frugally speaking, I want to sort out the budget for next year this week, but time is slipping away from me.  The girls want to go to Wisbech tomorrow for a look around at Asda and Morrisons - there is a new Morrisons there, and they both have a little cash to spend and ideas as to what they \"need\" already.  Half the money they have been given this Christmas is safely put away in the bank, so they don't have a lot - I think that they have about £25 to spend on some clothes each, so they will be looking for bargains and good value!  It will take a while to get there, so I hope for harmony in the car and not too much disagreement between them....At 4pm we are going to see a friend and her little girl, so we will have to be back by then.  Friday morning is the Craft club at the chapel, and then I think peace will reign again until I have to go out on Sunday.  The girls realise that the days are rushing past now towards them going back to school and they are enjoying the holidays too much to be looking forward to that, although the EFG has had me on Amazon this afternoon buying revision guides for her GCSE English texts.  We can't find one anywhere for Blood Brothers, though, so she is a bit worried about that one.I do hope that you are all enjoying the break from normal routine - I know I am - I have read my three Christmas books that I was given, and done some knitting too."},
{"title": "Christmas 2011", "date": "Sunday 25 December 2011", "text": "The start wasn't too early at 7.30am, but the girls piled onto our bed to unwrap parcels straight away.  The FH was delighted with his new cap, braces, Maltesers, body care products and Fred Dibnah DVDs.  I unwrapped some new books, truffles, a spice rack and some new bamboo knitting needles in a very fancy Cath Kidston wrap case - it is gorgeous!  The girls had the modest little heaps of things they had asked for and chosen so they were happy.We went to church for a 10am start, and it was lovely to share a couple of hours with close friends from the village, and there was a lot of chat and fun to be had.  We all share opening one of our gifts together, and we had taken along a little box of chocs for the 95 year old lady to open, and another friend had brought her a plant pot of hyacinth bulbs which pleased her immensely.Lunch was served at about 2pm - beef for three of us and a turkey leg for the YFG.  Pudding was some time later!  Then I think I fell asleep for quite some time - I certainly missed out on the Queen's Speech.  The girls watched some films, and then I remember watching Ratatouille, which is fun!  Some light snacks have been eaten tonight, mostly tea and mince pies, the girls have watched Dr Who and now the FH and I are watching Downton Abbey's Christmas Special, although he has one eye on the puzzle he is doing, and I have an eye here!!We have UJ coming for lunch tomorrow and then cousins joining us in the afternoon, so we are in for a day of company tomorrow.

{"title": "The mince pie recipe", "date": "Thursday 22 December 2011", "text": "I found the original version of this recipe on the Moneysavingexpert website back in 2008 and have since adapted it slightly to increase the amount it makes, so I am now sharing my version of the only mince pie recipe you will ever need.  Forget Delia, Nigel and Nigella - this recipe comes from the next door neighbour of an MSE poster called Researcher!It now makes 5 dozen mince pies - and you won't have any hanging around!1.5 lbs of SR flour (yes, SR!)8oz Trex (white vegetable fat)4oz lard6oz caster sugar2 eggs100ml cold water (exactly 100ml, not a drop more or less)I find that this quantity of pastry requires 2.5 jars of mincemeat.Place the flour and sugar in a large bowl and rub in the fat until it looks like breadcrumbs.  Beat the two eggs together and mix into the flour/fat with the water using a knife.Then use your hands to knead the mixture and pull it all together into a large lump of pastry.  The pastry is very pliable and soft, so I find there is a need to be gentle with it!Use plenty of flour to roll out a fifth of the piece, and cut out large circles to line the tins.  After adding a teaspoon of mincemeat to each, pop on a smaller circle for a lid, and then make holes with a fork in the lid, and brush with beaten egg.  Repeat until you have used up all the dough.I cook these in a fan oven at 180C for about 10 minutes until they are lightly golden.When I remove them from the oven, I leave them to rest for about 10 minutes before I attempt to remove them from the tins.  The original recipe tells you to put a wire rack over the tin and tip them out, but I found that the lids fell off when I tried that, so now I ease them out extremely carefully with a palette knife, but they are fragile when they are hot, so it is better to leave them for a few minutes.  I do have the odd casualty which the FH hoovers up, but in making 5 dozen tonight, I released them all whole!A little sprinkling of caster sugar before serving finishes them off beautifully.  They can be frozen!"},

{"title": "Cracking up", "date": "Wednesday 14 December 2011", "text": "Marriages, that is.  I am so sorry to have to say that another one of my friends' marriages has broken up, and I just don't know what is going on.In the past year, I have had this news five times, and not one of them was a marriage that anyone could see was in serious trouble.  OK, one of them had been grumbling along for a long time, but it seemed like it would go on like that for ever.  Is it a sign of the times we are living in now?  Is it a symptom of the financial crisis?  Is it that people are realising how short life is, and that they don't want to live in miserable relationships?  Do modern couples lack staying power, as the FH seems to think?  In a light-hearted way to conclude this post, these are the FH's top tips for making this marriage of ours last with my notes in brackets:Love your wife and make sure she is your best friend. [Works both ways!]The woman is always right....If she changes her mind, go along with it!Don't complain about the state of the house - she will soon find you a list of things you could do to help.Let her control the money and ask for pocket money regularly.  [Only do that if she is good with money!  Insist on regular reports on the financial health of the family - he gets a weekly update.]Pull together in the same direction - share common life goals and outlooks.  [I wouldn't have got on with a spendthrift!]Present a united front to the kids - and communicate often about the kids."},

We sang it on Saturday at the Recognition Service and I found the words so powerful and moving that I just had to share them.I also want to share the full text of a verse I found a reference to on Fostermummy's Beautiful Life blog.  The Bible I am using is a different one, so it is a slightly different translation.Exodus 14.14The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to keep still (NRSV)So the song mentions of our devotion to God, and the Bible verse reminds us of his powerful love and care as he watches over us.  Sounds good to me!I spent some time on Saturday and Sunday evenings writing Christmas cards, so I have to head off to the Post Office for stamps today!  There are also some wee parcels for a few folk which will need to get posted soon, too.This weekend has really helped with the Christmas feeling.  Saturday was lovely, as I went to a Recognition service for a friend who has managed to make it through Faith & Worship and become a fully accredited Local preacher.  The service was very moving, and it was good to catch up with some other friends from across the circuit.  I sat next to an older gentleman, who has been a LP for over 50 years, I believe, and he was telling me how he manages to take a service every week, without ever actually writing a sermon down on paper.  He puts all the preparation time in, but it is all in his head!  He is a retired baker, and whenever he comes to our chapel, he brings along the most beautiful hand made cream creations - eclairs, etc!After that, I came home to find that the others had had a good afternoon at the village bazaar and managed to find a few customers for books.  Then we got together again to go to a friend's house for a drink and a few nibbles and a chat.  It was a good hour and a half, and the FH actually stayed a bit longer as he was very interested in the alterations that the family has recently done to their house.  The girls and I had to nip off as I was babysitting for another friend, so their children came to stay for the night.The girls and the other two had a lovely evening, playing on the Wii and watching DVDs - the FH and I soon retired upstairs to watch TV in bed with a cuppa!  Yesterday morning, I quietly got up and went to church, and left them to it!In the afternoon, I made a Christmas cake - a very simple one which I got from here - with just three ingredients: SR flour, dried fruit and chocolate milk.  It is going to be wrapped up and stored for a week now, and then I will attack it with some marzipan next weekend.  I have used that recipe before, and it was well received.  [Edit on Monday afternoon to report that the cake has stuck irretrievably to the paper and when we attempted to remove the paper, huge chunks of cake came away too.  I may now have to go back to the Christmas cake recipe I have used with reliable results since 2000, and this concoction may have to become Christmas cake truffles - I have seen a recipe somewhere!]I have also written all the Christmas cards this weekend, ready to get them in the post today.  The girls have wrapped all the parcels, so I need to have a rummage through them to find the ones I need to post!Hope you have all had a good weekend, but don't ask about the tree - that's next weekend's job!"},
{"title": "Fudge recipe link", "date": "Friday 9 December 2011", "text": "I was asked on Wednesday night whether I would be making fudge for Christmas again this year, and I have had to search websites this morning to find the recipe - and found it here on the blog, posted last Christmas time.  So for ease of finding it again, I am linking to it here!  It is a fab and easy fudge recipe, so do give it a go for teacher gifts, and little offerings to friend!The term is winding down a little now, and I am looking forward to an even slower week next week.  Today just holds a brief visit to the Knit & Natter group at church, then taking the EFG to see the dietician at the local hospital, home for a while and then gym tonight.  Definitely a slower day than yesterday or Wednesday.  I was very tired yesterday after the concentration of the two meetings and driving to Cambridge and back.  Next week's diary is less full, and I am really hoping to get the house tidied and cleaned before the girls break up from school, and to get some Christmas baking in the freezer - not too much for us but a few mince pies to share at church, for example, and to have out when we have company over the holidays, which I know we have planned in on a couple of days.The job interview for the position at school was interesting.  I'm saying no more at the moment, as we haven't quite decided about the person yet!  She also has a number of considerations we have asked her to think about so that she is ready to decide if she wants the job should she be offered it.I have joined in with Sft's sealed pot challenge, although I haven't sorted out a pot just yet, but I have one in mind that I have seen in a shop - a cheap 99p one which has to be opened with a tin opener.  I feel that this level of security might be useful, as people here have a tendency to raid my wee tins for change and I don't intend this one to be raidable.  I could hide it, but if I do that, I am less likely to actually put money in it, and I really want to fill it up!Spending this week has been reduced in some ways - there has been less spending, as I intended, on bits and pieces and stocking up on things we have run out of and just can't wait for!  On the other hand, I have had to pay £45 for a new pair of glasses for the EFG and £10.50 for the YFG's piano lesson, neither of which I have begrudged as I know exactly where that money has gone and why - it's the odd bits that disappear on a drink and a snack when we are out and about that we must stop!  I am working to eliminate that by making sure that I take along drinks and snacks - so it is largely down to me to work on that one.  Staying strong about staying out of the shops is also my job, because I have two girls who love to poke around the supermarkets, so I have to keep them out of them!"},

{"title": "Online shopping", "date": "Wednesday 7 December 2011", "text": "I have had my first delivery from a company called Rosspa which is an online grocery shopping store.  It is different from the Tesco/Sainsbury/Asda etc deliveries, because this comes overnight by City Link tracked delivery.  Knowing then that it comes by courier in an ambient temperature van, you wonder what they can bring, but they bring fresh meat, fish, yogurts, cheese, etc, as well as fresh fruit and vegetables, cakes, bread, eggs, etc.  I placed the order in half an hour on Monday morning, and it was here by 10.30am yesterday morning!  I was very impressed with the quality of the fresh fruit and veg - the broccoli, courgettes, apples, bananas, plums, carrots and sprouts which I ordered are all beautiful, fresh and in the case of the bananas, not over ripe as they are just tinged with green.Everything was extremely well wrapped and packaged - the bananas were wrapped in cushionwrap and then in a bag whilst the eggs were all individually wrapped in kitchen roll, on a tray, with more kitchen roll over them before another egg tray was placed over them, elastic bands all round and placed carefully in the box with more packaging around them.  They made it here without even a crack.  The meat, yogurts, and veg were all packed in polystyrene boxes with ice packs, which are all re-usable here!  Everything was still cold, and I was impressed with the system.Prices are very good - heads of broccoli weighing between 600g and 800g were 39p each, and I was very pleased that I ordered 6 so they are all chopped up and in the freezer now.  Bloomer loaves of bread were 59p, and tins of Highlanders Broth, from Baxters, were only 79p.  That stuff is difficult to find in normal supermarkets, and over a £1 a tin when it is found, so I was happy to stock up and stash 6 tins away with this delivery.  The girls love this, and it makes a good meal with a hot pudding occasionally, although they would eat it daily if they could!  They discovered it on our trip to Baxter's Highland Village in Fochabers, and have been enjoying it ever since, whenever I can source it.Drawbacks?  Delivery costs £5.50 for each 25kg package.  That is the only one I can find.  And there is plenty of justification for paying that: the convenience of the system, the speed of the delivery, the quality of the goods (they are good!), and the prices of the goods, as well.  It has been recommended that a good idea would be to place a monthly order, to minimise the costs - I accept that I wouldn't have weekly order, the way that some people have a weekly supermarket delivery.  It would also be possible to share a delivery with a neighbour if you each wanted a smaller amount of produce. It is also a moneysaver in that one is not tempted by all the other distractions of the supermarket!"},

So first of all, I have to say a huge thank you to Silversewer, over at her blog - do pop over there and check out daily life in Scotland, sewing and gardening, and cooking on a budget.And now to nominate my top five picks:This is a little difficult, as I don't want to re-tag people who have already won, and we are limited by the rules to blogs which have less than 200 followers, so there are some blogs which I would have chosen but which have too many followers!  There is another I would have chosen too if I could have had a longer list, but that blog is private, and there are a couple more who don't accept awards!  This isn't easy...BUT my top five blogs which fit all the criteria:Wannabe Sybil's Witterings where WS talks about her son, Little Bear, and what he is up to.  He is an endearing little chap, and the tales are lovely.  Family life in a big city, on a budget, using public transport - I love it!A Trifle Rushed  is a predominantly cooking blog with some fantastic recipes, and it is beautifully written.my beautiful life is one woman's journey through life, the ups and downs, and she is frugal, spiritual, and shares the trials and joys of life.  Well worth a read.The Thrify Garden/Home I enjoy because of the cooking, baking and gardening posts.  Mrs Mac shares family life and frugal times.The Farm at the Back of Beyond 2011 is Gentle Otter's tale of life as tenant farmers in deepest rural Perthshire, and she writes so eloquently of the struggles of life as well as the positives that it makes me cry at times, but my love for Scotland makes me deeply ashamed that people would have to live in these conditions in the UK in 2011, and I support her quest for Land reform in Scotland, and I have written to MPs and MSPs about their situation.I have to share the rules now:Thank the giver and link back to the blogger who gave it to you.Reveal your top 5 picks and let them know by leaving a comment on their blogs.Copy and paste the award onto your blog.Have faith that your followers will spread the love to other bloggers.Have fun!!Come on over and pick up your awards, and readers, please have a look at the blogs I have nominated - they are all great!"},
{"title": "What a day!", "date": "Sunday 4 December 2011", "text": "I can't begin to express the range of emotions I have been through today!  The service this morning went well - the sermon went down well and the service was well received, and some of the congregation from the village came along to the service as well, as there was no service here this morning due to there being a carol service this afternoon.  It was lovely to share the service with the two congregations, who mingled well.We had taken the EFG to help a friend with some painting scenery for the Guides Christmas performance before we left, and so we went to collect her on our return to the village.  Our friend opened the door and I thought something awful had happened by the look on her face - and I was right: she and her husband have split up.  We spent some time with her and her little girl, before coming home to grab some lunch, and then dashed back to the village to pick up an old lady of 95 to go the Carol service.  That went well, and all 9 readings were done beautifully - we had a microphone out so that the children could be easily heard, as some of them have quiet voices.  Tea and fruit cake/mince pies afterwards made in that bit more special, and we were there until nearly 5.I heard today of another friend whose marriage is looking rather rocky due to financial struggles and strains, redundancies and strife in general.  It's been a very up and down kind of day, and I feel rather useless in that there is little I can do to help these friends, apart from being there for them.  I've got to start thinking of the week ahead now, and that begins with ironing the school uniforms, as usual.  But my prayers will be a little more fervent tonight and for some time whilst I know that these dear friends and their families are in such turmoil."},

Toodle pip - sleep well.I went to Sainsbury last night and bought some trashy magazines, the sort covered in stuff about losing weight for Christmas, what to wear for all those Christmas parties, making the best Christmas cocktails, 200 presents under £100 etc - food for thought for the sermon I still have to get down on paper.The gospel reading is John the Baptist, wandering the wilderness, preparing the way for the Lord, so I am thinking about the way the world is preparing for Christmas, and whether we as Christians are preparing the World for the coming of Christ.Still more thoughts to ponder, as it will be this evening before I get a clear slot to get this on paper, but it is coming together!!"},

I'll be bucketing the water down to the chicken runs this morning as the hose pipe will have frozen up overnight...must think of a plan to avoid that, somehow.Today is looking busy - craft club at chapel this morning till 12, then our first Worship Lunch from 12 -1 which I am helping to run.  Got to help the FH sort and pack books for a sale at a local school this afternoon - setting up from 2.15pm, and then I'll pootle off to pick up the girls and go to gymnastics until 7.30pm.  Thank goodness they have left over enchiladas for their tea tonight, so I don't have to cook.  The EFG might get dropped off to help the FH instead of coming to gym, but I'm not sure what she is doing yet.Last night's plans went awry and the sermon didn't get written.  It obviously isn't going to get written today either, because there just isn't going to be a block of time spare.  Unless I do it late tonight...unlikely.  BUT I do have ideas going round in my brain so all is not lost;  there WILL be a sermon by Sunday, never fear!!Better get started on those chooks - see you later :-)"},

{"title": "Monitor success", "date": "Tuesday 29 November 2011", "text": "I am hoping that the monitor continues to have a positive impact on our electricity usage.  I take electricity readings at least fortnightly but mostly weekly, and have been doing so since May.  This past fortnight has had the lowest weekly average usage since I began keeping the records, and it can only be that we have all had an eye on the monitor.  If we can keep it this low, I will be pleased, but if we can go lower, I will be ecstatic!Wild, windy and wet weather in the Fens this week - it is quite warm today although there is a wind.  I have cleaned the chicken house out this morning, which has been quite an effort, but they are all happily pecking and dust bathing in the new fresh bedding that I have put down.Sunday was our wedding anniversary - we have been married 15 years, although we have been together just over 19.  We kept the day frugal and just had a sponge cake at teatime with the girls to celebrate.  My dad was right when he said that it is the Marriage that matters as the Wedding quite often goes by the wayside.  The wedding cost us less than £250 back then, but I remember a lovely day spent with friends, and the memories are worth a lot!I am preaching on Sunday so I have to get a service together - I think the theme might be Waiting, but it might also be to do with Shepherds, so I need to think about it all and make my mind up, as there are a number of other things that have to get done between now and then, so I don't have a lot of time to make the decision because I need all my spare time to actually prepare it all...Hope you are all well, and I will try to get back sooner this time!"},
{"title": "Monitoring", "date": "Wednesday 23 November 2011", "text": "It has been very interesting and a source of some excitement (sad, but true!) these past few days.  What is it?  An energy monitor!We don't know where it came from, but it appeared in the post at the weekend, addressed to the FH, which is where the mystery begins.  If I had ordered it or even bought it, it would have definitely been addressed to me, not him, so that narrows it down a little - most likely to be something to do with the FH.  There are two options left - that the FH put his name down for it amongst other offers at the local flu jab tea and cake afternoon that the surgery organised, which is possible, going on the fact that he came home from that afternoon with an energy saving plug, so there must have been people there from companies or charities to do with helping older people save money and energy.  Option 2 is that the EFG put his name down on a freebie website she frequents - samples of strange teabags turn up occasionally, the odd pack of shampoo arrives in the post, that sort of thing.  An energy monitor doesn't seem to be in the same league, so I am in favour of option 1.So, we attached it to the electricity wires in the meter box as instructed, and got it all set up.  It hovers around 4p/hour most of the time when we are not doing much, so that is covering the three freezers and two fridges, and the air pump in the sewage treatment plant - all of those are on constantly, although I know that the refrigeration equipment will cycle a bit.  When we put the kettle on, it leaps up to about 43p/hour, and the dishwasher and washing machine are each putting it up to about 37p/hour - I haven't had them both on at the same time yet.  I haven't dared see what the oven does to it, yet, although that will happen later on today when I do some baking.  I have been using the Remoska instead of the oven more often lately anyway, and that hardly used much at all.So thanks go to whoever sent it as it is educational and motivational as well; it is in the kitchen where we can all see it when we pass, and it is helping us to be more aware of our energy use. There are buttons where we can get it to tell us how much power we have used in the past hour or 12 hours, but I haven't read that section on the leaflet yet - I'll get to that soon..."},
{"title": "The other side", "date": "Sunday 20 November 2011", "text": "We came through!  We made it to the other side, and now I have done it once, I have a better idea what to expect next time Ofsted come calling.  Can't say any more than that, but I am very grateful for all the support I have had from friends, in real life as well as blogging friends - thank you!Lesley - I would have taken more people in there with me if I had known that I could, but I managed!  He kept me waiting for an hour, which added to the tension but I don't know that many of the others would have known any more, and a very experienced Chair that I know has confessed that he would have had to bluff his way through a question I floundered on as he wouldn't have known either!!  And so life resumes: if you remember, I spent the week before this rather poorly and not doing an awful lot, and then this week has been spent in panic mode, so I haven't done a lot at all at home.  The girls and I blitzed the lounge yesterday at tea time, so that we had somewhere more pleasant to sit for the evening - Saturdays are tv and knitting at the moment - Strictly and then Merlin.  Last night we also tried to watch a Nicolas Cage film called Knowing, but towards the end the screen kept pixellating, so we attempted to retune the tv twice and then gave up - the ITV transmitter out in Norfolk is having some work done to it, so we hope that the issues will be resolved when that is finished.The school washing is done, and is drying on the airer, and we have been to chapel.  The EFG is at school [yes, on a Sunday] preparing for her art exam.  They have to do 5 hours tomorrow and another 5 on Tuesday, so today they are spending 4 hours at school preparing their boards and refining their ideas.  The FH dropped her off earlier, and we have to pick her up at 2pm.The weather here is atrocious today - thick fog, and very chilly so we have the fire alight.  The FH and YFG are watching a film version of \"A Christmas Carol\" as she is reading the book at school as a class text - she'd much rather watch than read and I am a little bit cross about that as it is the lazy way to do it!  The EFG and I have read all the Harry Potter and Twilight books, but the YFG just watches the films and we cannot get over to her how much of the stories she is missing out on...The latest Twilight film is out now, Breaking Dawn part 1, so we have to get some Tesco vouchers exchanged for Cineworld tokens so that we can go and see it soon.Hope you are all having a good weekend :-)"},

I am going to be at school for the chaps from Ofsted arriving at 8am, and then I am going back to be interviewed at 3.30pm.  I know about our plans, our aims and our targets; I spent yesterday afternoon checking through our Governor policy folder and helping the secretary with some stuff, as well as talking with the Head for about an hour.  She has had the pre-inspection interview on the phone and the pre-inspection report came through so she had some data analysis to do last night when I left at 6pm.  It is her first inspection as our Head, of course, but she is experienced in these things as a Deputy Head, so I know she will let them know exactly how things stand.Had better go and let the chooks out soon, find some posh clothes to wear, and then, when I have some time after I have greeted them, I am coming home to think through what I think our strengths and weaknesses are, and what we do well, and then I have to make a few cakes - it is the FH's birthday today, and there is a Christmas Coffee morning at chapel tomorrow so I need to do some baking to get ready for that - life has to go on, Ofsted or not!"},

{"title": "Christmas in the Fens", "date": "Monday 14 November 2011", "text": "Let's just face this head on.  Christmas is coming, and fast.  The EFG knows to the hour how long it is until Christmas and frequently tells me...she is obviously keen on Christmas.But we are a fairly frugal family, so what has she got to look forward to?  What is she so keen to experience?I think she is, like me, looking forward to spending some time at home, with the family, with nowhere to go and not a lot to do, where we can spend time together, watching DVDs, knitting, chatting, snuggling by the fire, and enjoying having relatives visit us for meals and chat.  We'll be in church a couple of times - I am taking the service Christmas morning, so we'll all be there then for sure!There will also probably be a jigsaw to do - I always spend money on that, I am afraid, as I buy a new \"Christmas\" themed jigsaw each year, preferable a Ravensburger one.  They are excellent quality, and in about 5 years time, I guess we will have a serious collection and stop buying them as we will be able to go around again and not remember them!There may be snow...there may not!  There will be good food, maybe a glass or two of wine or home made sloe gin, and there will be some presents.  Some.  Not obscene amounts.  Not enough to cause debt problems which would take me months to pay off.Christmas for us is never about spending a lot of money.  We have had our little 5ft Christmas tree since 1992, making it 19 years old this year.  It works fine!  We love our collection of decorations we have acquired and made or been given over the years - there seems to be a red/green/silver theme going on, but it is purely accidental.  The FH made a wooden shelter for the knitted nativity figures to stand in - they were made with love by a lady who has known me all my life and was a great friend of my mothers, and a great knitter.  And a candle bridge stands in the window, glowing each evening to welcome people to our door.  And then there is the food.  Probably a turkey, but perhaps a nice piece of beef.  Or a large chicken.  We haven't quite decided yet, but I will rummage in the shops and see where the best deals are.  Roast potatoes, in goose fat, some roast parsnips, broccoli, cabbage perhaps, and carrots.  Lots of gravy and stuffing.  Then the pudding and brandy butter - home made, of course.  The girls sometimes prefer to have a Vienetta ice cream as they don't like pudding.  I don't buy Vienettas during the year, so although they usually cost about a pound, they are still a treat as they are not usual fare here.  They might like a self-saucing chocolate pudding, though, so I shall have to consult them.  At tea time (more food? Really?) it will be fairly simple as we are usually still quite stuffed from lunch - perhaps a sandwich or roll, some crisps, a jelly, and maybe some cake - Christmas cake, or something lighter.And that is usually that.  Christmas is a fantastic time which we are all looking forward to, but I am not about to go mad with the credit card and cheque book!"},
{"title": "We really won't forget", "date": "Saturday 12 November 2011", "text": "I have been reminded today about the friends and family we have in the services, and the part they are playing in today's military. The FH's cousin's grandson is in the RAF, and his fiancee is in the Navy - we heard today that they have just had a baby boy, so the family has grown overnight!  Not quite sure what relation we are to that baby, but it is a big family!  The father is serving in south Wales at the moment, so is very glad to have been able to combine a fortnight's leave with a fortnight's paternity leave to enable him to spend a month in Aberdeen with his fiancee and son.  They will be getting married early in 2012 and then should be able to get married quarters and be together properly.  The father has recently returned from a tour in the Falkland Islands.The EFG's godparents' son is serving in the Navy as an apprentice/trainee engineer, we believe, working on helicopter engines.  He has just spent six months in Afghanistan and we were hugely relieved to hear of his safe return.At this time of year, we are remembering those who have fought and died, as well as those who are still serving and giving their all."},

Apart from the memorable time I got locked in the loo during the morning practice session, I most clearly remember the time my class recited the AAMilne poem about Christopher Robin having sneezles and wheezles.  I found it for you here so do read and enjoy!  I have had the sneezles, and have now progressed to the wheezles with a chesty cough...The EFG has been to two more Open Evenings for 6th form this week, but neither place has topped the one we saw last week, so that is still her top choice.  Now we hope that she might be able to go there for a day or half a day to see what it is like on a day-to-day basis.  That is next week's mission."},
{"title": "On trial - nearly there", "date": "Monday 7 November 2011", "text": "I have been training, doing the first part of the course to become a Local Preacher in the Methodist church.  It is quite a challenging course, and I am only just at the beginning!  I have had to do three units of work and then on Sunday, I took the service at the local chapel and two people came along with notebooks to assess me - very nerve wracking!  And with this cold that I am suffering from, it was quite a challenge.  The two assessors were very kind, and the feedback mostly positive, so I am very relieved!The next step is that they will report to the Local Preachers' Meeting, in early December, and I will also be interviewed at that meeting.  If the community of Local Preachers likes what it hears, they will recommend that I go forward \"On trial\" so that I can take services, whilst I continue with the studying - a further 17 or 18 units of work!  The tutor I have just met in the last week seems to think we might manage a unit a month, but I am not so sure - there are only so many hours in a day...we have 5 years to do it, but I hope not to take that long.Here we go on another journey - another strand to this life!  Can't wait to see where it will take me, really!The days have been chasing by, and I have hardly had time to stop and gather myself.  Unfortunately, I have come down with another cold, or perhaps I never really got rid of the last one, but I struggled through Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  I have given up with today so far and allowed myself a bit of a duvet day so far!  I have to go out for 3pm, but only for a short while, and then I will be home again.  I lit the fire early this morning before the girls went off to school, so the temperature in here is quite warm."},
{"title": "Nasty Netball", "date": "Thursday 3 November 2011", "text": "We don't mean that really - we girls all actually enjoy netball (well, I did when I played it!) but the problem is that it has caused us injuries!  I broke my toe when I landed after catching the ball when I was about 10, and yesterday the EFG broke her finger when she caught the ball and the ball bent her finger badly.She has had it examined and x-rayed today and strapped up, so I have to take her to the hospital to the fracture clinic for follow up on Monday.  Having it in a sling for elevation has helped the pain, she says.So, if she broke it yesterday, you are asking why it only got examined today?  I thought it was only badly bruised, so I didn't take her yesterday.  However, the PE teacher had her again today, and although the EFG had wanted to play again today, the teacher wouldn't let her and recommended that she get it looked at, hence the trip to the minor injuries unit after school today.  The bone is not broken through, but it has chipped a little off the side near one of the joints.We made it home from the unit and then went out again almost immediately to go to the 6th form evening at a nearby college.  We quite like this college environment, and the EFG asked a lot of questions in the various departments - she is interested in Biology, Chemistry, Art and ICT.  One of the computer department staff explained the difference between ICT and Computing qualifications and she has begin to consider Computing, I think, whereas last time we talked about it, it was an absolute no.Long day, longer one on the cards for tomorrow, so off to bed now, and taking honey and hot lemon drink as I can feel a sore throat coming on, and the sneezles have already begun.  The wheezles have yet to ensue!"},

Although I am not old enough to be a member, the FH is, and several of my friends from the Knit and Natter group are supporting this plan, so I am being helpful too!  Tonight they held a \"Pudding Evening\" as an initial fundraiser and publicity event, so I made a pudding to take along.  I couldn't stay to the evening as there was a Governors' meeting but I made a Sticky Toffee Pudding, and dropped it off.I made this one from the Good Food website.  And I made two!  Well, never having made it before, I had to double the recipe so that the FH and UJ could do some quality control and make sure it was fit to give to the pudding-eating public!  They declared it acceptable, so I allowed it to go to the party.I couldn't eat it, but it and the sauce really do smell lovely!!"},

He was a British legend, and I have many happy memories of Saturday nights watching \"Jim'll Fix It\" on tv when I was a child. He sat in a huge red chair, I think, smoking enormous cigars, dripping in gold!  He \"fixed\" some amazing things - and he did an astounding amount of fundraising, for Stoke Mandeville Hospital as well as for other things.  He ran marathons, too!  He was inspirational, and the world will be poorer for his loss.Great plans don't always come to fruition, do they?  I had hoped to be able to post more often here this week, but what with one thing and another, I just haven't had the time.  As I have said before, reality has to come first!I was delighted to read a list of the top 30 things that research has found make us happy.  I want to share the list, so I have it here to come back to now and again.  I am also really pleased that a lot of these things are cheap or even free!!Finding a £10 note in an old pair of jeans (well, I went one better the other week and found a £20 note in the pocket of my bodywarmer but made a note to be more careful with my cash!)Going on holiday (roll on next June)Getting into bed with freshly washed sheets (totally wonderful!)Swimming in the sea (not sure about that one - perhaps abroad but not here...)Waking up on a sunny day :-)Sitting in the sun (yep - even in the winter it's good if you are in the  verandah)Being surprised with a gift of flowers (just last Friday!)Getting a nice message from a loved oneCuddles (All the time )Receiving a thank-you card in the post (sent my dad one last week for the lovely Sunday lunch)Seeing an elderly couple holding handsDriving a car with the window down on a sunny dayWinning £10 on the National Lottery (well, you have to be in it to win it..)Booking your holiday (done that!)Hearing your favourite songFinding a bargain (my favourite sport)Seeing an old friendPicnic in the parkGetting a promotionA romantic night out (must have a word with the FH about that)A song that reminds you of your pastLooking at old photosMaking a new friendHaving a quiet moment to yourselfWalks in the countryHearing a baby laugh (26/30?

This list was published in the Daily Mail today on p11.  Worryingly, it says, \"The hustle and bustle of everyday life means that the average person is only happy for half the week.\"  I don't like the sound of that!We have had a good week: the girls have each had a friend round on different nights for sleepovers, and one brought along a boxset of Merlin DVDs so they had a massive Merlin marathon!  The YFG has been to the cinema twice, once with a birthday party gang, and the other with just one friend.  She has seen Dolphin Tale and Monte Carlo, and reports enjoying them both.  I think that Dolphin Tale is quite a tearjerker though.  We have had some time at home, but the culmination of the week's activities for the girls must have been last night's Guides sleepover - I dropped them off at 5.30pm at a church hall in a neighbouring village, and collected them this morning at 11am.  They have done an incident hike, apple bobbing and all sorts last night and then had a campfire this morning and toasted marshmallows.  We have a closed Guiding group on Facebook so the leaders were able to share photos of the events as they progressed - they look like they had a load of fun, but they are shattered today.  And we have a party to go to tonight, so they will have to find their second wind before 7pm...a friend in the village turns 60 so she is having a wee hoolie, and we are invited! My achievement of the week has been completing a piece of knitting - a twirly scarf.  I am quite pleased with it, but I did it in a multicoloured yarn and with hindsight I think it may be better in a solid colour, so I might do another one...so wish I had a camera working so I could show you!!"},

I am going back to buying it in bulk as the feed shop's deliveries have been unreliable - it has been very frustrating the last twice I have been in there to find that they haven't had sufficient delivered and have sold out already.We have watched \"Strictly Come Dancing\" tonight - and the two favourites are Chelsee and Jason at the moment - and there doesn't seem to be anyone else coming close!

Although I am \"at home\", I am obviously not sitting on my backside all day watching the television!So, alarms went off today to wake us up, and I got up to wake the girls at 6.45am.  I pottered downstairs at 7am, made a cuppa and turned on the Breakfast news programme.  The girls came downstairs and made their breakfasts, and lunches, and then, once all their stuff was ready for school, they turned the channel over to watch part of \"One Tree Hill\".  I drank my tea and did some knitting.  Quite a bit of knitting - until about 7.55am when the girls left.I started on the day properly then!  Quick tidy round in the lounge, and a swipe of the kitchen.  A quick swipe!  I then put on my coat and wellies and went outside at 8.30am to let out the chickens, feed and water them, and check them over generally.  This takes about half an hour.Once I came in again, it is time for another cup of tea, and a slice or two of bacon for my breakfast - the FH has surfaced and he has some too.  Time to turn on the computer, check the banks, emails and blogs I check through.  By 9.45am I am back outside, booting up the washing machine in the workshop, hanging the last load done yesterday, and having a quick tidy round in the verandah where I hang the washing.  At 10.30 I started cooking the tea - shepherd's pie, cabbage and peas.  All cooked and chilling for later.  In between that, I get a message that another Governor needs a reference for something, as he has put a note through the door earlier whilst I was outside!  I phone him, check my emails and find the form he needs me to fill in has come through, so I make a phone call to the agency that wants it to briefly discuss it, and then I fill it in and email it back.  I also print off a copy to sign and send back.By 11.30, I am preparing some paperwork for tomorrow evening's Governing Body meeting.  It takes a while, and then we stop for lunch at 12.30.After lunch, I slice up a fruit cake I made yesterday and arrange it on a platter.  I also wrap another one in clingfilm and write a label with the list of ingredients on it.  I stick that on the bottom!  You may have noticed that I haven't got dressed yet!! I am still in the fetching pair of leggings I pulled on when I got up, so I go and have a shower now.  I put on some older gym clothes, and start to load up the car.  At 2.15pm, I leave the house with spare clothes for later, the cakes, the snacks for the girls, etc, and head off.First call is the chapel where I leave the cakes, the sliced one for the Harvest Supper refreshments and the whole one for sale in the Auction of produce.  I then nip off to the Co-op in town, where I grab some potatoes and cauliflower from the Reduced section, and collide with some very old friends in the car park.  We have to chat for a good while to catch up on the news since we last met, and I find out that their daughter is in an interview for a job as we were speaking - I wish her lots of luck!  I then leave, at 3.20pm to nip in to see a friend from chapel who I know is going through some tough times.  There is just time to have a chat and give her a big hug before I am off again to pick up the girls at 3.35pm, luckily not far away.The girls get in the car and we head off to gym where we help the Head Coach to finish setting up the gym for the evening's sessions.  The girls have a Mug Shot for their \"tea\" and I catch up with the Head Coach.  The other coach arrives, and I get changed to move on, again!  Normally I would have stayed and coached but tonight I had a meeting, so I had to leave.I set off at 5pm to work my way through the evening traffic to a big town about 20 miles away.  I arrive at the offices for a 6pm meeting and I am a little early.  My colleague from the school arrives and we have a meeting there for an hour and a half.  She talks and I take notes.  At 7.30pm, I leave that office and call in to Tesco - the EFG has a huge blister lingering from the marathon walk the other weekend, and she needs some special blister plasters, which I eventually find.  Arriving home at 8.20pm, I find the FH here, lighting the fire, but the girls nowhere in sight.  I had expected him to fetch them home from gym so I am a little puzzled but then he explains that a friend who also has a daughter at the gym class will bring them all home.  Sure enough, they all turn up 5 minutes later.We are all eating the previously prepared Shepherd's Pie by 8.45pm and then the girls start having bath/shower time.  The FH watches \"The Body Farm\" and I am listening whilst I am typing.  Still to do is the washing up and shutting up the chickens for the night - we are very lucky never to have been troubled by foxes here, or this would be too late.  This has been one of those days where I have been constantly on the go, and not at home.  Other days are similar, but sometimes I get to spend more time here, when I can do more house work, ironing, etc and some gardening.  Yesterday morning I spent all morning cleaning out the chooks and then spraying the shed for red mite again - then I enjoyed some time in the school, doing French conversation with some Y6 children, which was fantastic.That would have been a better post with some photos, but the camera is still out of action!  I can't charge it up because we have lost the power cord so I either wait until I find it, or can buy another one cheaply..haven't found one at the moment.."},
{"title": "PS", "date": "Saturday 15 October 2011", "text": "GO WALES TODAY!!I have just updated the Winter Preparations page with a few more of the things I can cross off the list - we have had the oil tank topped up, I have sorted some candles and matches and torches out, and I found some hot water bottles and bought two.  Just have to knit or make some covers for them to make them more cosy to cuddle...We managed to get a couple of pence per litre off the price of the oil by arranging a delivery jointly with our neighbour who also needed to top up.  The company, Goff's of Kings Lynn, also allowed us to apply the OAP discount that the FH is entitled to, to the whole delivery, so I was very pleased, as the neighbour was as well, as he is only in his late 40s, I think!We haven't had the woodburner alight yet this year, although temperatures are definitely beginning to drop in the early mornings, like now, and in the evenings.  I can see it being lit soon, perhaps this weekend.  We are still being careful and using rugs and jumpers - there is no point using energy if we are not taking some measures to get warm as well - I see houses where the heat is clearly on and windows are open because it is too hot inside, and people are walking around in the house half naked!  What a waste of energy and money....And with Winter comes Christmas!  I am beginning to make more efforts in my preparations for that too.  I have plans for some presents - and I even have some presents organised already, which is a relief.  I am fully stocked with Christmas cards, wrapping paper and tags, but I may need sellotape!  I have one present ready for the YFG as she has mentioned something and I bought it when I saw it.  I also have a stash of Tesco Clubcard vouchers, and going by the tally on the receipts, I should be getting a pleasing amount in the next round of vouchers, so they will go towards Christmas too - not necessarily in grocery shopping as I may be able to use some of them for presents in Rewards - I know of at least one subscription to a magazine I can get for one person, and then I will get some cinema tickets for the Christmas holidays too.  I have built up the balance a little with the extra vouchers that they have sent me for acquiring bonus points, and taken advantage of an offer to get 500 points on ink cartridges too!  I need the ink, so why not get the points too?I am also planning to reduce the number of chickens I have to reduce the costs of overwintering them whilst they are unproductive.  Plans for my life have changed and breeding chickens is no longer a big part of them, so I will be gradually moving the chickens on to new homes, or the freezer, over the next two years, and I don't plan to breed more, or buy more either.  On another topic entirely, it is a bright but chilly morning out there, but as I type I can see a young lady who has turned 12 today, quite literally flying around the estate on a new bike she must have had for her birthday.  The huge grin on her face tells me that she is clearly delighted with her birthday gift, and her brother is having a hard time keeping up with her as she pedals like mad!  The YFG is going to her birthday tea tonight, so I am sure we will hear all about it.  Happy Birthday, T :-)As I posted months ago, the doctor had recommended taking time to do something just for me, and I am happy to report that I have been doing just that!I have knitted two pairs of wristwarmers, and I am now knitting a twirly scarf, which is coming on nicely, but may not be ready for this winter!  I have to knit a whole 50g ball of wool into it, and there are only 20 stitches on the needle, so I spend as much time turning as I do knitting.I have also helped to set up a Knit and Natter group at the chapel which meets fortnightly, so I am able to pop in there for an hour or so, turn off from everyday life and sit and knit and chat with friends - and get some help with my knitting if I get stuck!  It is lovely, very relaxing and a bit of an oasis of peace when the rest of the week is busy.I do get some knitting done at home as well, sitting in bed before I go to sleep, and occasionally when there is something good on the tv."},

Thursday was a busy day with the Headteacher's performance management meetings in the morning and then a book sale at the school in the afternoon - lots of books to lug about.  Came home and collapsed.Friday was Knit and Natter at chapel and then gym - the last session I had to run without the Head Coach.Saturday we were up at 5.45am to get everyone ready as the girls needed to be at the start of a long walk at 7am.  They were walking laps of 6 miles to raise money for the Guide unit  in the village - the day dawned cold but dry, but the EFG got wet later on.  She managed 13 miles, and the YFG did 10.  By the time I got home from gymnastics, the EFG was fast asleep on the sofa and the YFG was tucked up in my bed watching a DVD.Sunday was another very early start, as we loaded up three trios of GPOs and took them over to Peterborough to the showground where the Autumn Show was held.  They were penned up early and then we met up with UJ and later with my cousin, and we walked around, did some shopping, chatted with some people we met up with by accident, and had a picnic in the car.  The chooks all sold by 1pm, so I collected my share of the profit after the poultry society had taken their cut, and we toddled off home.  UJ took the FH with him, and they came straight home whereas the girls and I had to do a little shopping for some tea.  We had done some shopping at the show - the EFG chose a beautiful wind chime with a dragon on the top of it.  The dragon is jointed and moves gracefully.  And then today - I have been on a Safer Recruitment training course for the whole day.  My brain is slightly fried, and I am quite tired from sitting still and lack of fresh air.  I am glad I don't sit in a classroom all day any longer...some of the tales we were told today are quite harrowing to imagine, and it has given me a lot of food for thought about how we protect children in schools today.  It is a Huge responsibility...And tomorrow - back to school in the morning and then gym in the afternoon.  I am looking forward to some time at home on Wednesday, although I have to attack the red mite problem again.  I have bought some Poultry Shield to spray around, as it comes highly recommended.  Fingers crossed xx"},
{"title": "Three down", "date": "Wednesday 5 October 2011", "text": "The Head Coach went away last Thursday night, so we have managed three sessions without him so far - just one more to go!  Last Friday and Saturday's sessions were OK, but yesterday's was the most challenging as my voice has diminished to such an extent that I have to use a very deep tone to make any noise at all, and that was a surprise for the girls to hear such a deep voice!  There were just three of us last night to run the classes, but we did OK, and the girls worked hard.  We always run the classes slightly differently when he is not there, as we work co-operatively, rather than doing as we are told by a boss, and so there is a change in the atmosphere.  Not that it is bad when he is there, it is just different - I am sure that you will know what I mean - two women running things are going to do things in a different way to one man....I will be glad to have him back on Saturday though, as I have had enough of the responsibility this week, feeling as rough as I do.The FH had to take the EFG for a routine hospital check yesterday and she saw a new consultant with some different ideas.  He thinks she might have some of the symptoms of PCOS, and is also concerned about her insulin levels, so she has to be taken back to the hospital Monday morning before 8am to the ward for a blood test.  Hope we get somewhere soon with all of this.I have booked a holiday for all of us next June half-term - in Yorkshire, on the coast near Bridlington, and I am so looking forward to it.  I have had to check with UJ that he is OK to come and house sit here for us whilst we go, and he is fine with that.  The holiday home is a log cabin, and looks lovely - two twin bedded rooms, each with an ensuite shower room, and a lovely open plan kitchen/dining area/lounge.  Enough room, but not huge.  Bridlington is about four hours away, so it won't be an arduous journey, and it is close enough to Filey, Scarborough, Whitby even, that we have lots of places to go - and I am sure that there are loads of things to do in the area.  Hopefully in June the weather will be decent - I am going to say \"decent\" rather than \"wonderful\" because going on this year's record, it may not be that great, but it should be OK!  I have paid the deposit now, so it is all systems SAVE for the rest of the costs!Today: a couple of meetings at school - 11am and then 1pm.  Tomorrow: a meeting with the school inspector at 9.30am for a couple of hours, and then running a book sale in the afternoon.  Fingers crossed that the FH's foot is OK today so that he is able to do the piano lesson run tomorrow; he had to go to the nurse yesterday for some acupuncture for gout in his toe!  Seems to have worked but he is going back next week for a top up appointment.Off to get started on the day now that the honey and hot lemon drink has done some good."},

Birthday wishes have also appeared on Facebook this morning from friends who get up earlier than I do!I don't intend to do an awful lot this morning - I am going to go and let the chooks out, and then I may retire back to bed for an hour or two, read a new book I bought myself (well, you have to make sure you get the right one!

The UK is becoming so pc that it is unbelievable, and the powers that be are bending over backwards to accommodate all the other faiths and cultures that are making their homes here now that they risk alienating the Christians, but we don't seem to matter.A Sikh bus driver often comes through the village at the wheel of a Norfolk Green bus - I know he is Sikh as he's wearing his turban.  Muslim girls attend the college in a nearby town - I know they are Muslim because of the way they are dressed and their headcoverings....but how would anyone know that I am a Christian?  I might choose to wear a cross on a chain at my neck, but hold on, I might get dismissed from my job if my employer decides that it is against the uniform code; I can't show silent DVDs of the Bible on my tv in my cafe in case they incite violence; if I am a Relate counsellor and say that I am unable to counsel gay couples because of my faith, I will be sacked; if I am a Registrar and refuse to officiate at civil partnerships because of my faith, I will lose my job.  But if I am a Muslim and want to pray at work, they will provide me with a room to do so, and I am allowed to nip off at the appropriate time.  As Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, has said, \"No one wants to deny homosexual people rights, but can a way be found for Christians to have rights as well?\" and I would add to that that I am perfectly happy for Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, humanists, atheists, etc etc to have their rights, but I don't see that they have to be at the cost of ours as Christians.  I have also noted that whilst the Queen is \"Defender of the Faith\" as Head of the Church of England, I have heard that perhaps Prince Charles will choose to be \"Defender of faiths\" which is quite different.

I looked in Mary Berry's Baking Bible and found her \"Quick Boiled Fruit Cake\" - there's a link to it here but this person has added bicarbonate of soda and brandy, which aren't in the recipe in the book.  It turned out well, and UJ and the FH thought that it would make a good Christmas cake.  They had a taste with a cup of tea this afternoon and then I wrapped it up and he took it home to enjoy this week.  The FH hopes I will make another one soon!This week I have been investigating the A level options for the EFG.  There are a limited number of places she can go that are accessible from here, and so I have been looking to find out when all the Open Evenings are in order to be able to take her along to get a flavour of each venue and the courses available.  We have about 6 to go to already!  Most are in November.Yesterday evening she and I attended an Art GCSE evening at school to find out how she needs to progress her art - she is in line for a good grade, but the teachers invited all of the children along last night to look at work from last year to inspire and encourage them.  It was a very useful and informative evening.Today I have entered some of my chickens in to a sale of chooks at the Autumn Show at the East of England showground.  We sold some there last year, and so we are hoping for a good day this time. We enjoy the show, and UJ is interested in coming along with us this time.My cousin turned up quite out of the blue this evening, in quite a distraught state.  She had had to call in at a local bridalwear shop to cancel a fitting for a wedding dress as the wedding has been cancelled.  It is a long story and not one to share, but needless to say it has come as a shock to her and of course, to us to a lesser degree - still a shock but much less impact on our lives, if you see what I mean.  Quite a few things to reflect upon this evening, and I have to take the service at chapel on Sunday, so I am thinking about that tomorrow too.

We have also stripped the greenhouse out pretty much, and are getting ready to replace the benches in there for the winter. A friend up the road has a polytunnel just installed, and I am quite envious of that, but I am not so keen on all the work involved in digging trenches around it to get the cover buried! She's welcome to all that!There's a bit of a party going on at one of the neighbour's tonight - there are hordes of cars in the road, disco lights flashing in a marquee in the back garden, and people mooching about - but all is peaceful and I can't hear any music, so it is not bothering me. Hope they have a good party! One of the FH's friends has been here for a cuppa this afternoon, chewing the fat - and he and the FH have been talking about a home made dehydrator - sounds good! I have been doing a bit of research on the internet tonight and found a few ideas for them to copy, so we could be looking for odd pieces of this and that to use to put one of these together; I'd love to be able to make some fruit leathers and dried apple or banana chips, for example. I could dry some of those chillies too!Hope you are all well tonight - I'm off to do some more knitting as I want to get these wristwarmers finished soon...."},

The FH's lunch club meets today, the girls' Guides group resumes tonight (subs due for the term too, so have just been scrabbling around in the egg money box!), and the Governing Body AGM is tonight as well.  Last night gymnastics started up for the term again too - the first week is always stressful what with all the parents trying to pay their subs for the term, thrusting envelopes, cheques and wadges of cash at me to register their payment.  Last night was worse because of the renovations which have been done in the sports centre which meant that all our equipment has to be stored in a slightly different way, and it is a challenging jigsaw to get it all back in the cupboards which have been built now - it took us a little longer than usual, but hopefully we will get used to it quite quickly.   I did feel quite tired after it all last night, but I always do for the first few weeks!!Blue skies this morning, so I am planning to get some more washing done.  The wind has died down a little, so more gardening work can progress too.  The FH went to the wood yard yesterday to buy more gravel boards to raise the sides of my vegetable beds, but somehow didn't buy enough wood, so will have to go back for more at some point!  Our list of \"outside\" jobs grows longer as we think of them, but we are working through them all steadily - getting the chickens into their winter quarters is top of my list at the moment.  Those chicks in the photo are partly sold off now, and some of them are in their winter home.  Others may yet get sold, but a few are cockerels which may be destined for a casserole.We are having a little knitting festival here at home at the moment - the EFG has joined me in knitting wristwarmers as she wanted a pink and green stripey pair, and now she is knitting at every opportunity!  She is sitting here now in the minutes before she has to go for the bus, knitting away.  I'm quite impressed with her stripes, and she is doing quite well.  I have finished the initial pair bar the sewing up which is waiting for a needle to use, and have also completed the first of another pair in a plain denim blue wool.  I am enjoying knitting them as they are practical items which I know we will use, and they are also relatively quick to complete."},

I wish I adapted as quickly, as these mornings are taking some getting used to.  I still want to roll over and go back to sleep when the alarm goes off.This morning I spent a couple of hours outside, moving things around.  I put the three little Barred Plymouth Rock chicks into a new house, where they promptly sat and sunbathed in a very sheltered corner, absolutely loving the sunshine.  Lots of plastic growing modules and plant pots have been evicted from the potting shed as it needs to be made over into a chicken shed, so the pots have to be relocated to the verandah.  We also dismantled a chicken house which has another infestation, and put up the newer one which has had its infestation cleared out.  The chickens are quite happy with the new house and laid eggs in it already this afternoon, so it is christened in that respect.  I managed to get a load of towels dry on the outside line without any of them blowing away!This afternoon has been paperwork and phonecalls, and then this evening I have had to sew up the EFG's trousers and do some knitting.  I am a little bit annoyed about the trousers as I bought two new pairs for her this year, and paid the shop £5 to have both pairs turned up.  She wore one of the pairs for a couple of days last week and already both hems on that pair are down.  On closer inspection of the sewing, it is awful!  I will not be using that alteration service again.The weather hasn't been too bad here today - there has been plenty of wind, but it has also been beautifully sunny too, and I have enjoyed being outside.  I am hoping that no one has been badly affected, but I have heard in the news this evening that someone has been killed by a tree falling on a car, so I know that there will be sadness for the people who knew that person tonight.Frugally speaking, I have had a NSD (No Spend Day) today, and indeed have acquired several pounds through the sales of 3 dozen eggs - all regular customers who all chose today to request a dozen eggs each.  I hope to have more days like today!  The bank accounts need building up again, and I am glad that I am not going on holiday this October - as lovely as it was to go to Scotland last year, I am not sure  that the bank balances could take that bashing again this year!  I need to save close to £1000 to meet my savings target for the year, and I am not sure that it is going to be achieved, but I will do my best!"},

I know that most of us do some of these things, but could we all do more?  I am sure that some of these things come as second nature for people but others would be more of a challenge.  I am thinking, as the preacher asked us to, about three of these things to really work on this week.  Today has been a good day, and I feel like I have got quite a bit done but in a relaxed and comfortable way.  The School Washing is done and ironed, the homework has been checked and the children are upstairs, and have been nagged to within an inch of their lives in order to get them to bed before 10pm.  The target was 9.30pm but there was a scrum for the shower with them both declaring at 9.15 that they were going for a shower, so more planning is needed in that area!  We will have in under control soon :-)We have battened down some of the hatches in preparation for the 25 mph winds which are due to hit us here tomorrow - that is nothing compared to the 70 mph gusts which I know are forecast for other areas, so we are fortunate that we should escape the worst of the winds here, but I shall be thinking of all my more northerly friends and thinking of you.  I have been thinking about those people I know who have been affected by the 9/11 events and remembrances today, and watching the tv coverage on the news with tears in my eyes.  It is heartbreaking to watch those children reading out their late parent's names in the lists of people who died."},

One or two ladies were saying that it was even more delicious because they knew how fresh it was as it was still warm!  It went down well, anyway.  I sat and knitted for about an hour with the ladies, having finished the first set of wristwarmers so I started on another pair as the EFG has laid claim to the first ones.  I must get the side seams sown up and then she can have them.This afternoon I had my first meeting at school with the new Head; it went well and I get the impression that we are on the same wavelength and will get along well.  We face a heavy workload this year as we are on the up, and there is still a lot to do, but I can be confident that there will be significant improvements made by the end of the year.  The village will soon have a school to be proud of!After that, I nipped off to the town to meet the girls who had walked round to the Head Coach's house.  We have to move the gym equipment back to our \"home\" gym tomorrow and there were some preparations to do for that - taking the legs off the beams and things like that.  We are meeting a man with a van there in the morning for a couple of hours' work, and then the new term begins again for gym on Tuesday.Tonight the FH has gone out with his friend to a beekeepers' meeting.  I don't know how late they will be back, but I think that it will be good for him to go out and re-connect with some of the people he knew at the club 20 years ago when he was last a member before he came to Scotland.  The girls are upstairs, doing things - the YFG is on the computer, and the EFG has a friend on the phone who has just called up about some homework.  I had thought of calling my sister tonight but this girl talks for England so I have no chance!And with the return to school comes the return of the School Washing - the chore that involves getting the school uniforms and PE kits washed and ready to go again over the weekend, and typically means I am ironing shirts on Sunday evenings.

{"title": "Gentle Otter", "date": "Monday 5 September 2011", "text": "There is a blog I read about tonight, which has moved me to tears of shame and frustration, and to a wealth of admiration for a very determined lady.\rIt moved me to write an email to the First Minister of Scotland, the MSP for the area, and the MP for the Perth & Kinross area.  I wonder if they will reply.\r\"Dear Sirs\rI have recently been reading about a farmer in rural Perthshire whose home is threatened with a demolition order because the landlord hasn't effected sufficient repairs to keep it in a habitable condition.  The farmer and his family are living in appalling conditions, with no electricity and no safe, clean running water at the moment, as their supply has been contaminated with eColi through no fault of their own.\rRead for yourselves here \rhttp://gentleotterblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/awful-news.html\rand if you have the stomach for it, go back through this poor lady's writing and read of the terrible things that they have had to endure in the past year.  I read it and wept for her situation and for my shame at not knowing that people still live like this in the UK.\rI lived in the neighbouring county of Fife for 10 years, and had no idea that this sort of Third-world existence could be allowed to happen in Scotland.  I am ashamed that the powers that be in the UK can allow this sort of thing to continue - to allow the landlords so much power over their tenants, so much control over their circumstances and be allowed to get away with such paucity of responsibility.\rI want to join the others who must have been in touch with all of you over Gentle Otter's situation in calling for support for her and her family in this abysmal situation - and look at the tenancy laws of Scotland and England/Wales with the intention of reforming them in the not too distant future.\rAlthough Gentle Otter is a blog name, you can contact her through her blog and I am sure she would be delighted to hear of any support and advice you can offer to her.  Please stand up and be counted and let her know that these countries of ours are not going to let the laws continue to allow people to be treated like this - she and her husband depend on that farm for their livelihood, and their home, and she is determined not to be forced out of a home that her husband's family have tenanted for over a century.\rYours sincerely\r(I signed it)\"\rKnowing that I lived within about an hour's drive of the area where Gentle Otter lives, I am ashamed that I didn't know that people still lived like that in 2011.  I'm not completely naive, but I did think that clean water was pretty much a given, but GO doesn't even have that most of the time, and the house is now under a demolition order, as I said in the letter, so she is facing a pretty dire situation.  She is being very decent and refusing to publicly name her landlord on the blog, but I have my suspicions, having lived in that area and knowing a tiny bit about some of the landed estates.\rIf you are so minded, please add your voice to the others contacting the powers that be to ask them to help her and other tenant farmers in Scotland (and England/Wales, as the tenancy laws are weighted in favour of the landlords everywhere, it would seem).  Email addresses are available at the Scottish Parliament website, for the First Minister, and her local MSP, Richard Lochhead.\rTonight I am giving thanks for a dry house, clean running water and showers that work without a second thought, a washing machine that cranks to life whenever I need it, and the simple fact that this house is ours, and I don't rely on a landlord.  I am very fortunate.  And I don't work even half as hard as this brave lady.\r\r\r\rI had a little disappointment this week in that I thought I was growing peppers on two plants I bought from the local nursery, but I discovered that they are in fact chillies!  So I had to look around and find out what to do with them, as I have never used them in cooking as I don't like hot and spicy food to that extent.\rBoth plants are well covered in chillies, and I picked about 15 of them last night.  There are still more to come!\rI found this recipe on the BBC Good Food website for Sweet Chilli Jam and the FH highly recommends it - says it is lovely!  I have tasted a tiny spoonful and the taste starts off very sweet in your mouth but then the chilli kicks in and you taste the \"bite\" of the spice, and it is quite OK even for me.  For the FH, who loves more spicy stuff, he says it is \"Just right\" so if you like spicy stuff, I'd say, \"Have a go\".  The only downside to this recipe is that it calls for 8 red peppers, and at 70p each, that outlay was quite extravagant for 4 small jars of sauce/jam.  If I can find a cheaper source of the peppers, I may make some more...It's quite a normal looking house, but people don't stay there long! \rWe moved into our house in June of 2004 and the first couple moved into the house next door in the September.  They were quiet, very quiet, and very much kept themselves to themselves.  Then they decided to sell up, but the time wasn't right, so they ended up renting it out instead, and a lovely family moved in; they were coming back to England from Portugal, and were a couple - English woman and Portuguese man, she didn't work at first whilst they settled their son into the village school but he works for Tesco.  Then they were told that the house had sold, so they had to move out, which unfortunately co-incided with them splitting up, so she and the son went west and the man went east.  \rThe new owners were another couple, but older this time.  A very nice couple, quite reserved but very pleasant company and we get along very well.  But they have decided to leave, and they are moving out right now.  The new owners take possession at noon, and we are sitting waiting like the nosy neighbours we probably are, to see what they look like, whether they are another couple or a family; the girls are interested to see whether there will be children; I am hoping that there isn't a dog (nothing against dogs in particular but we are surrounded by a particularly noisy bunch of dogs here!).\rOf course, we are hoping that they don't mind chickens, that they won't be making remarks about the state of our working garden, etc!  We are one of the families in the estate which actually uses the land we have, rather than looking at it as many do as a piece of grass to be admired!  In between the veg beds, chicken runs, driveway and sheds/greenhouse, there isn't much grass in our garden and our plot gets a bit, shall we say, \"untidy\" at times?!\rSo, we wait...and hope!"},
{"title": "Storecupboards and pantries", "date": "Sunday 4 September 2011", "text": "One of the two wardrobes we have moved into the garage for pantry storage.  The FH has re-jigged it since I took this picture, but it gives you an idea of what we are doing.  Lots of Branston beans bought on the buy-one-get-two-free offer at Tesco recently, UHT milk, etc.This is a work in progress and I will add more up to date photos when we are nearer completion.\rDo you shop often or are you a once a month kind of person?  Do you live near a supermarket, or perhaps you have to travel miles to a shop?  Have you tried supermarket home delivery, or maybe they won't even deliver to your postcode?  And do you menu-plan or fly by the seat of your pants?\rAll these things might affect your attitude to keeping stocks of food in the house, and your economic circumstances probably affect it more than anything.\rThere are various blogs and websites which take opposing views on this - you just have to google \"stockpiling\" and you will easily find hundreds of pictures of vast pantries and piles of tins and packets.  There are similarly websites which advocate buying only what you need each week.  I really like this blog at Grocery Cart Challenge where Gayle attempts to feed her family of 6 on only $60 a week at the grocery stores.  She gives lots of recipes and thrifty ideas, as well as a weekly menu plan and pictures of what she buys.  I like to check out her menu plans now and again for new ideas!\rI stand somewhere between the two extremes, although as we are heading towards winter, I am veering over to the stockpiling side.  As I said in an earlier post, I really hate driving in snow, so if I think there will be any, I'm staying home until the cold snap passes, and we live on what we have in the house - so I want to be sure that we have some decent stocks in hand.\rOn the other hand, regular and long time readers will know that I have done Challenges where I spend £100 in a month on essentials and use up what we have in stock - this is going over to the other side of the coin.\rThere are definitely pros and cons to each method, and I do like the pros of the stockpiling!  It means that when things that we use weekly are on sale, I can stock up, knowing that the items will get used because they are part of our regular shopping.  Things that will bear long term storage are best for this - tins, bottled and dry goods, for example.  Just make sure you rotate the stocks so that the oldest stuff is used first!\rThe biggest benefit to the other method is money in the bank!  It allows me to save for something I need by not shopping.  When we wanted to buy the woodburner a year or two back, we simply stopped shopping for anything other than what was essential - and we soon had the money we needed, because we had the stocks put aside of what we needed.  Most of what I bought those months was fresh fruit and veg and dairy products.\rAmy Daczczyn in her Tightwad Gazette books (I have all three - bought at the beginning of our frugal life and well worth it!) talks about a Pantry Principle.  Instead of menu planning and then shopping for what you need to make those items for the week, you go shopping and buy only what is on sale, keeping a price book so that you know you are getting the best deal on most stuff.  You then plan your meals from what you have in stock.  It does work out cheaper in the long run, I believe, but it also means that some items may be absent from your diet until they come on sale again!  If you can manage with that, it works.\rThere is an Australian website called Simple Savings whose owners have written a book, the $21 challenge in which they give chapter and verse on how to do a challenge week, now and again, to use up what you have in stock, and spend only $21 to supplement your stores.  There are some great recipes in this book, and I am going to be trying some of them out soon.  This idea is similar to my £100 month challenges."},
{"title": "The week that was", "date": "Friday 2 September 2011", "text": "I can't believe how fast this week has gone past!  \rYesterday I did manage to take the girls and our two friends, S and K, to Wimpole Hall and Home Farm.  Despite the weather forecasters predicting grey cloud for the day, the sun shone bright and clear and there was hardly a cloud in the sky all day - it was fantastic weather for the summer we haven't had!\rWe started off at Wimpole in the house, and had a good wander around there for about 90 minutes, enjoying all the old things and historical atmosphere.  It was S and K's first visit, and they both said how much they liked it.  It was interesting to see how much had changed since we were last there in 2008.\rAfter that, we walked up to the Farm, a good ten minutes' walk away.  The girls loved the Adventure playground and the Hay Bale maze, enjoyed seeing all the animals, and were very keen on the ice creams!!  There was a quick stop off in the National Trust shop before we left where we gathered a couple of small souvenirs of the day.  A thoroughly good day was had by all and we were all tired out by the time we got home.\rToday we have had a bit of an up and down day - the FH has been out a couple of times, the girls have both been chatting with friends, the weather has been great again and I got a couple of loads of washing dry, but the down sides have been me having an upset stomach for a while, and the YFG having a bit of a moan this afternoon!!  She's better now and happier, thank goodness.\rI have discovered a new-to-me author, whose name now escapes me, but his first name is Nicolas, and I devoured a book in two days - and there are lots more by him for me to enjoy, so I will be looking out for them in the library soon.  \rNow I am going to see if I can sort out some photos and edit them into some of these posts!  Don't hold your breath, though... \rJust a quick edit to say that I have managed to get some photos in there of the wardrobe, some pickle and some fab cake made to Mary Berry's recipe, so it may be worth a quick flick through some of the older entries to catch up on the photos - although there is one of my sore foot you may want to avoid if you are foot-phobic!!"},
{"title": "Go Mary Berry, the Baking wonderwoman", "date": "Monday 29 August 2011", "text": "I have long had trouble making a decent Victoria sponge, but having lashed out some Nectar points and a couple of quid, I bought the new Great British bake-off book which accompanies the second series, and hey presto - I can make a good Victoria sponge! People actually say how good they are, and I am very happy!  (Sad what simple things can make me happy, really!)\rIt is a fairly simple recipe involving 8oz each of butter, sugar, and flour; 4 eggs, a tsp of vanilla extract and a tbsp of milk.\r\rSo, what's the secret?  Well, the recipe in the book actually explains about beating the ingredients to get the air into the mixture.  You are told to beat the butter, then beat the butter and sugar together for quite some time, and then add the eggs whilst beating even more - and then the folding in of the sifted flour with a big metal spoon.  All that I used to think of as faffing about, but it Really Makes A Difference....so now I do it - have made several plain sponges with raspberry jam and a sprinkling of icing sugar, and have also tried a coffee and walnut version, and even a chocolate version - and they all work.\rNow I am confident with the sponges, I am going to try some of the other recipes in the book.  And I have ordered Mary Berry's Baking Bible from the library, so I can't wait for that to come in, and who knows what I might learn?!We are getting down the list of things we wanted to do this weekend, but more things keep getting added on to the list!  \rWe have shovelled a tonne of horse poo which a kind friend donated this week.  He brought his trailer and left it on the driveway, so that we could remove the very well-rotted manure to our garden.  Trouble is, as you can imagine, the garden beds are not really ready to receive the manure, since they are still full of plants, so we have had to decant it into bags and store it.  It will be a week or three until the beds are clear and ready for it.  The shovelling made my shoulders ache a bit but the exercise must have been good for me...\rThe grand re-arrangement continues.  The bedroom is looking good, and the pantry in the garage is filling up most pleasingly - will take some photos to share.  The house is looking a little bit of a shambles whilst all this is going on, though - but unfortunately that is nothing new here.\rLast night, I made another batch of green tomato pickle - 10 more jars to add to the stash.  I must now have enough for about 3 or 4 years worth of pickle eating, so I will have to find another way of preserving next year's harvest of tomatoes....there is still ratatouille in the freezer from last year, so perhaps pasta sauce will be on the agenda - I may have worked out how to bottle it by next year...\rMy foot is now much better although the bruise came out most magnificently this week and drew me a little more sympathy, even though the pain has pretty much gone!\rThe week ahead is looking interesting: we are hosting a lunch on Wednesday for the FH and his 5 male friends who go to the weekly OAP lunch.  He took them to Hunstanton the first week of the summer break, they went to a 2-4-1 restaurant near Huntingdon last week, and this week, the last week, they are coming here.  UJ has helped with the menu, suggesting that he will bring potatoes, carrots and green beans from his garden, so that I can serve them alongside a home made Toad in the Hole, and then he will also provide fresh pears for a pear crumble with custard.  On Thursday, I plan to take the girls and possibly two friends to Wimpole Hall near Royston for the day, and then on Saturday, we might go to Sheringham, but that depends on the weather!  The FH will be taking three trios of GPOs to the Pure Breed auction on Sunday, and then we are into the last days of the holidays as the girls go back to school on Tuesday."},
{"title": "Bit of an upheaval", "date": "Friday 26 August 2011", "text": "We have been turning the house about!  The FH has built the wardrobe in the bedroom and I am so pleased with it - so much storage.  I still have to get the fabric for the curtains to hang in the front of it, but it has made such a difference to the bedroom already.  The old wardrobes have been brought down and reassembled in the garage, which is attached to the house.  We are gradually moving some of the pantry storecupboard into the wardrobes, especially the pickles I have made recently.  \rAll that moving around has meant a lot of moving, sorting, throwing things away, re-assigning storage places, etc.  We are having some fun finding things we haven't seen for a while - I found the headband I wore for our wedding 15 years ago - it has dried flowers on it, and we realised that it is the only thing from the wedding outfits that we still have!  My two-piece outfit came from the Save the Children charity shop in St Andrews for £10 and went back there a while later for some one else to wear and enjoy as well.  I loved it, but being cream, it wasn't practical and I couldn't see that I would wear it again.  Unfortunately the FH's waistline has expanded too much for him to still fit into the suit he wore back then, so that has moved on to a new owner as well.\rThe EFG has some excellent GCSE module results; we went to school yesterday morning to get them for her.  They are not her final results as she is only just going into Y11 (Y5 when I was there!) but they are good - some As, an A*, a B and a C, so overall, we are very pleased with them.  Adding to the last batch she got, and with the opportunity to build on them in the year ahead, she looks set for a good outcome this time next year.\rThe YFG is home from her holiday - the family she was with are certainly very active as they seem to have packed more into three days than we would do in a week!   We \"do\" one thing each day and then spend some time relaxing - knitting, reading, sleeping, depending on who you talk to - but they were on the go constantly, and she loved it as she is a very active child.  She has come home rather tired, but that is not a bad thing, and she is sleeping well at the moment.\rNow that I have learned about pages on blogspot from Ilona's recent post, I am going to make some separate pages for my winter preparations list, and for my list of things to do before I am 40.  I am working on both lists, and will get those pages up soon."},
{"title": "Rough and tumble", "date": "Tuesday 23 August 2011", "text": "Sunday was the calm before the storm - we had a lovely day which began in the village church, involved coming home and pottering about, having some lunch, relatives arriving in the afternoon and then all of us going off together to another church service about 8 miles away.  It was a lovely, warm, sunny day, and everyone was in a good mood!!  The YFG departed early at 8.30am with her friend's family for their camping trip - she was SO excited.\rBoth the church services were led by me, and the evening one was particularly special because it was the first time I was allowed to preach officially as part of the course I am doing to be Local Preacher.  I hadn't told my dad that I was doing the course, so although he knew that I was taking the evening service, he hadn't realised what it all meant.  He was quite touched, I think, and gave me a big hug at the end, which meant an awful lot to me.  \rMonday morning dawned dry and bright again, and the EFG went off to help with the decorating and making over at a friend's house, doing a spot of babysitting as well.  The FH and I had a mission for the day - to put a big new hand-built wardrobe into our room.  The FH had made it in pieces, and we had to remove the two old wardrobes, clean the 7 years of dust from behind them and then construct the new ones.  I have been looking forward to this for ages - they include 8ft of hanging rail for us to share and 32 sq ft of shelves for all sorts - bedding, jumpers, etc - and we got off to a good start.  We got the space cleared, and then we were beginning to put the new pieces of wood in, and we dropped one on my foot!!! OUCH!  One of the veins in the top of my foot blew up like a balloon, and the words coming out of my mouth were quite unbecoming of a trainee local preacher!  It really hurt, and we had to go to the local cottage hospital for an x-ray as I was afraid that the bones in the top of the foot were broken...they aren't, thank goodness!  It is very bruised, and still sore today, but I am doing ok and hobbling around.  It did put the construction back by a few hours, but we got the main body up, and the clothes back in, so that we could go to bed!  The front is open at the moment, and I am going to organise some curtains, so that there is no need to open doors into the room and hopefully it will give us more room.  The wardrobes we have taken out have served us well - in 5 houses over the past 18 or so years, so they don't owe us anything.  They are not set for the tip yet, though, as they are going into the garage for storage purposes.  Frugal recycling!"},

What with the pickle and chutney making, we are thinking about getting snuggled in for winter. \rI am considering my storecupboards and the loo roll situation, and thinking about what we need to stock up on.  I am pretty well convinced that we are in for another really cold and snowy winter, so I want to be prepared.  I'll sort out a big list of all the stuff I need to do and then you can let me know if you can think of anything I have forgotten!  Living out here in the sticks means that I really prefer to avoid driving when there is a lot of snow on the ground - heck, I prefer to avoid driving if there is ANY snow in sight!!  Bit chicken of me, but better safe than sorry - my worst nightmare is going out when all is well and then having to drive home through heavy snow, as that happened to me one dark night in Fife, and I was petrified to have to drive home alone.\rI'm off for an early-ish night tonight as I am so tired.  Toodle pip!\r\r\r\rAt last!  This has felt like quite a long week, but today is the last day of the gym holiday club, and we have had a good week, but it has been hard work.\rThis weekend is also going to be busy: on Saturday the YFG and her friend are getting her birthday \"treat\" trip to a local farm park.  We had to wait for the friend to come home from her holiday, so it has been delayed.  Then on Sunday it is the EFG's birthday, I have two church services to participate in, my dad is coming over....there will be a lot going on! AND the YFG is going away with her friend (same one!) and her family for a couple of days to a campsite near Gt Yarmouth.  The YFG has never been camping in a tent, so she is very excited.  We have to drop her off to them before chapel on Sunday morning, so it will be a really early start for everyone in order to get birthday presents opened and bags packed!  \rThe EFG's birthday \"treat\" trip is happening next week when her friend is available and we have a slot in the schedule to get out and about.  She hopes to go to Thetford Forest, but we have to wait and see what the weather is like.\rLast night, I made the second batch of green tomato pickle with the dates in it this time - it is definitely a little bit darker in colour, but it still tastes good.

{"title": "Beetroot chutney recipe #2", "date": "Wednesday 17 August 2011", "text": "This is my mum's recipe, dictated to me over the phone by UJ from an old handwritten recipe notebook that has been collecting favourite family recipes for a good number of years.  I have no idea where it originally came from - but it has been a success tonight, thank goodness!\rIngredients:\r3lb beetroot - boiled in slightly salted water for up to 1.5 hours, or until done if sooner.  When cooled, cut up into small cubes.1.5 lb cooking apples, peeled, cored and chopped2 large onions, chopped1/2 lb sugar ( I used brown)1/4 tsp ground ginger - I used a tiny piece of fresh, gratedjuice of one lemon1 tsp salt1 pint vinegar\rCook the chopped apples in the vinegar with the sugar, lemon juice, salt, ginger and onion for about 10 minutes until the apple is soft.  Add the beetroot and cook for a further 15 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced and the mixture is fused well together.  Stir frequently as it will start to stick when the liquid is reducing.\rBottle in warm, sterilised jars.  This amount made 6 jars for me, of varying sizes.  This is the recipe my granny used to use, then my mum, and now my uncle and I are also using it.  It works very well, although it is possible to modify it slightly to your own preferences.\rThe basic recipe calls for:\r3lb green tomatoes1lb cooking apples1/2 lb onions1 pint of vinegar1/2 sugar 1 tsp salt12 oz chopped dates\rChop the tomatoes and apples (peeled and cored) finely and bring to the boil in half the vinegar.  Then add the rest of the vinegar and the remaining ingredients, and boil for an hour, simmering gently and stirring frequently.  The instructions ask you to sterilise the jam jars and then bottle the pickle once it has cooled, but I find that putting it in the jars when it is hot means that it pulls the seals down on the jars more effectively.\rWhen I made this last weekend, I had no dates in the house, so I just increased the sugar and apples to make up the weight, and it has worked fine.  UJ reports that he likes it without the dates just as well.  I have bought dates this week, though, so I intend to make another batch to include them so that we can do a taste test!  I have to find/acquire/beg some more jars from somewhere though...\rI am off now to make some beetroot pickle so I will post the recipe for that if it works.  The beetroot chutney I made last week was from the Sainsbury's magazine, so it might be on their website...goes off to look...no, can't find a link and now can't lay hands on the magazine either!!  Will let you know if I come across it later!\r\rIt is that time of year again!  Courgettes aplenty and what to do with them all?  I posted before about some cakes we make with courgettes, but there are other recipes under development here too!\rThis year, I have taken to gently frying a sliced courgette along with a chopped rasher of bacon and a clove of garlic, pressed through a garlic press, and then serving this on a bed of home-grown lettuce, tomato and cucumber!  This makes a very nice lunch, or light meal at any time of the day.\rA friend has made a meal of a small courgette by cutting the courgette lengthways, and then covering it with grated cheese and grilling it - this only works for people who don't mind eating the courgette almost raw, but since some people do like courgette raw, that might not be a problem for some.  I prefer mine cooked, if I am honest.\rWhat do you do with yours?"},

I do have plenty of tomatoes, and there is still plenty of ratatouille in the freezer from last year, so we may as well make the pickle this year.  Perhaps we can find something new to make next year.  I have found a recipe for bread and butter pickles, which I am going to try with the cucumbers which are beginning to mature in the greenhouse - they are definitely later than last year, but there are quite a few on their way.\rThe YFG has her friend coming round after gym tomorrow, so we are perhaps having a BBQ, although I have to go to town for some chicken food first.

She can't help herself having digs at me, and the EFG and I were nudging each other each time she said something!  There was one about the state of the kitchen floor, and then one about the last minute nature of the YFG's birthday cake.  It is so sad, really, because she seems to try to be superior, but the children are wise to it now, and sympathise with me, and laugh at her silliness.  We have thankfully got beyond being hurt by her barbed comments, as we used to be.  I used to sob sometimes at the things she said, but now we realise that she is the one with the problem, and we surround ourselves with people who are nice to us!!\rThe EFG and YFG are enjoying having some friends here for the night - they have been playing on the Wii and now they are watching a DVD before they all sleep on the sitting room floor!

It has been loading the CD for over three hours now, and still claims to be \"LOADING\" and has no access otherwise. It took it a good few goes to actually recognise the CD....and then when I rang BT to ask for help, I was on the line for nearly 20 minutes and listened to all the muzak, and then got cut off. BT - right now, I am not impressed......\r\rOn a more positive note, the FH and I have installed the new sink today. It looks smart but the kitchen is covered in a fine layer of dust from the use of the router necessary to enlarge the hole slightly. I am too tired tonight to do a full spring clean of the kitchen, but it has been added to the list.\r\rOff to bed now - reading \"The Other Queen\" by Phillipa Gregory - can hardly put it down!!"},

I have also walked around the garden tonight and picked several handfuls of different kinds of beans, so they will be cooked for tea tomorrow.  It is a real joy to be eating our own fresh food!  The egg numbers are beginning to wane ever so slightly, but not so that it makes a difference to the heap of trays in the utility room - I have baked a couple of cakes tonight, and there are more lemons on the bench, ready for another lemon curd marathon.\rTonight I am making courgette chutney - have a look at that link and perhaps have a go, if you have a glut like we do!  We have a big heap, so I may well be making more if the FH likes it.  I also found a recipe for beetroot chutney in the September issue of the Sainsbury's magazine, and I know where I can get beetroot and cooking apples, so I hope to give that a go, too.\rThe YFG has chosen her goldfish for her birthday, and they are happily swimming around in the tank in her bedroom.  She is absolutely worn out after her day out yesterday, and slept in until nearly lunchtime this morning.  She did come shopping with me this afternoon so that she could get the goldfish - but she soon fell asleep again this evening.  The EFG also had a long lie in this morning, but she is still up and about now - and has been in hysterics at the faces and comments that the FH has been making, as we asked him to clean a chick's bum tonight!"},

Hopefully it will dry overnight; the FH painted the inside for me with white emulsion and so I hope to be able to get it back together by the weekend.I cannot say how sad and upset it has made me feel these past couple of days to see this mindless violence and lawlessness which has blighted some of our major cities, beginning in London.  I feel ashamed and totally saddened to be part of a society bringing up young adults to behave in this way and I do think that parenting skills in this country need a lot of development and support.  Society has changed an awful lot in the past generation or two, and I believed this sort of thing to be a relic of the past, of things like the miners' strike and that winter of discontent that people talk about.  My heart goes out to people whose lives and businesses, homes and families have been blighted or even destroyed over the past few days by people with no respect for others.  It is disgusting!"},

Her mother had taken her other two children out of the way, and I arrived to find said child had barricaded herself into the bathroom.  Long story short - headstrong child who wants her own way, well meaning mother trying to be her friend, interesting use of discipline, and my recommendations were to step up and take control, as the child needs a mother and not a friend.  Mother needs help to deal with her, though.  Told her to look at Supernanny/Nanny911 type advice, as I am sure it is what she needs.All that made me miss the church service I was so looking forward to, so I was a little miffed!This afternoon we went to feed my friend's chickens, and I was devastated to open the box to get the eggs out and to get whiff of the smell of red mite - they are infested too!  And it is quite an infestation!  I missed it yesterday when we went because I didn't open the box for the eggs, as the YFG pulled them out for me.  I have had to shut the three hens out of their house, and provide them with a couple of perches and a nestbox in the area which is under their house, still within their run.  They will be quite sheltered from the weather under there, so it will be fine for them until next weekend when their owners get home from holiday.  I have mixed Diatom with the shavings in the nestbox I have given them, so that should help them a little.  I am not spoiling the people's holiday by letting them know - they will have a big enough problem to deal with it all when they get home, so they need to enjoy their break!!  Our own infestation has been reduced by the blow torch application, and we have fried a few more odd ones we have seen mooching today.  I have spoken with the editor of the Smallholder magazine and she has put me onto some chemical treatment which you apply to the hen, so I will be looking to see if I can source any of that tomorrow.  She's a lovely lady and very helpful!Tonight the YFG has a friend to stay, so it may be a late night..."},

That got the mud off so I could see the wood for the trees - then it dried overnight and I sprayed it with a proprietary treatment, early this morning, before we went to the church holiday club.  When we came home, five hours later, the sun was shining, and the little blighters were sunning themselves!  So we upped the ante a little, took a risk and sprayed them with Jeyes fluid diluted with water.  They lapped that up and laughed at me.  So we got the blow torch out........that fried a good few of them, and we have left the house now to dry out, and I will see what emerges in the morning.  Less, I hope.  I have found a local source of creosote, so I am hoping to get some on Monday and paint the house thoroughly with that.  I also take GTM's point that the roof will need sorting out as they are very likely under the felt as well.......oh, bother!The church holiday club has gone well.  We have the rounding up of it tomorrow in the Sunday service, which I am looking forward to, immensely!I went to see the doctor yesterday about how I have been feeling - she suggests having \"me\" time, and developing a hobby.  Mmmm, I said, and when would I find time for that?  She spins, weaves and knits, so we ended up talking about knitting socks..perhaps I should try.Tonight, I have cleaned my ensuite out and had a good tidy in there, and that was very therapeutic, so perhaps a good cleaning and chuck-out session once a week would be a good prescription."},

To cap it all, we discovered tonight that one of the poultry houses is heaving with red mite and the poor chooks have refused to go in (can't blame them) so we have had to have an emergency rehousing tonight.  A lesson to me to check them more carefully as they were hiding in the cracks near the roof....What with the Holiday club at chapel this week, keeping on top of the house, and now this, as well as coping with the sweltering heat, I am just about ready to give in and say, NO more!

I have cleaned lots of clothes, using the washing machine, of course and they have blown beautifully on the line - resulting in Mount Ironmore.  Can't worry about that tonight, though!  I have cleaned the kitchen up after the YFG and her friend made cupcakes, and I have cleaned the downstairs cloakroom.......We are off to bed now!  Looking forward to going to see the EFG and FH tomorrow at UJ's house - and my cousin and her parents are coming to see him and share tea with us all, so it will really be a day of rest and chatting - can't wait!"},

He loves to have some crispbreads with salad and beetroot.  He likes all manner of pickles and vinegary things, which I can't abide, so they are his and his alone...The YFG has been to the optician this morning and given a year's guarantee, and I picked up my new glasses, and some contact lenses to try.  I had some last year and they dry my eyes out terribly so I haven't worn them much, but these new ones are supposed to be different - and they are more expensive - so now I need to check out Lensway's website and see if I can get them any cheaper!I treated the YFG to a few streaks of a very subtle colour in her hair this afternoon, after borrowing a streaking cap from my friend who does our hair.  We had bought a semi-permanent colour this morning and she was itching to try it out.  She was going to do a skin test before we did it for real, but didn't read the instructions properly and mixed the stuff up completely, which they then say you have to use \"immediately\" so we took a chance and used it.  To be fair, it hardly touched her head at all as she had the cap on, so it wasn't as much of a chance as it would have been doing her whole head.  She now has some subtle tones of warmer colour through her dark blonde hair.  I can see it because I know it is there, but I doubt a stranger would realise!The EFG had a wonderful day at the Botanic Garden in Cambridge yesterday - I was very surprised to find out that there were only 7 of them on the course as I was imagining that she would have about 15 or 20 people there.  The EFG made a friend of a girl from Lincolnshire, from Boston, so that girl must have had quite a journey to get there.  They did all sorts of things with bread (yeast being an organism) and fermenting other things too, and walked around the garden.  She says she has even been inspired by the garden with some new ideas for her art homework, so double whammy there - biology AND art!The FH is getting a little bored and fed up with his caring duties, and given that he tells me that UJ has been hoeing the garden today, I guess that he won't need to be there much longer, although there are still some things that UJ needs a hand with.  By the end of next week, though, I am hoping that the FH will be home.  Really hoping!  We are missing him here too."},

She sat in the car whilst I had to do some shopping, and then she laid on the sofa when we got home, and watched a DVD for a couple of hours.  She is up and about now though, and thinking about tidying her room - still.  It has been an ongoing project for about three days, and still isn't done - it's a major re-arrangement job.I have lost my enthusiasm for tidying, or doing much at all, to be honest, today.  I have had the trip to town with her today, and I have done the things that needed doing, but rather than do the challenging stuff, I am thinking about going to bed now with a new book....we had some vouchers for WHSmith, so we spent them!  I do have a heap of ironing to do, but that will be there in the morning.The YFG is coming home tomorrow, when the FH and UJ come back to the village for their lunch club.  She has missed us, and been quite vocal on the phone about coming home, but this time away has been good for her!  She has certainly caught up with her sleep, so she should be full of beans.  The EFG will be going back with them tomorrow afternoon, so that they can take her into Cambridge early on Thursday to attend a Gifted and Talented Biology workshop at the Botanic Gardens.  She is looking forward to that; she attended one at the end of Y7 which was a week at the Engineering Dept of Cambridge University, then at the end of Y8 she did a 2 day Writing workshop at the UEA in Norwich, which she loved.  Last year, the courses on offer were a bit strange and she didn't fancy any of them, but this time I found this one just at the last minute and there were some places left - and best of all, this one is free!  I hope she enjoys the day.The garden is getting over run with weeds in a couple of the raised beds, and I am going to have to attack them with some weedkiller on a still day, because they are thick with couch grass which is impossible for me to dig out.  If I can get them clear soon, I will be able to sow a winter nitrogen crop, ready to dig in in the spring - at least, I think that is the plan, but I have never done it before.  There is always a first time.The EFG will be thinking about which A level courses to apply for come the Autumn, so we will be attending open days at local 6th form colleges, and considering her options.  At the moment, she wants to be a teacher, so A levels are definitely on the cards, but her thoughts currently involve Biology, ICT and Art, which seems like a strange combination, so I think we had better take some advice on that!  Any teachers out there who care to shed any light on the matter - feel free!"},
{"title": "Moving out", "date": "Monday 25 July 2011", "text": "The YFG has gone to stay with the FH and UJ until Wednesday, so the EFG and I have had a day at home, pottering around.  We had a long sleep in this morning, not waking until past 9, so the first thing I had to do was feed and water the poor chooks, who must have thought that they had been forgotten!  I have done several loads of washing today to take advantage of the sunshine.  I am keeping an eye on our electricity consumption, and reading the meter every Monday, so that was done this morning too.  We are using about 140 units a week - that has been the rough average of the past 9 weeks, which is coming in at about £18 a week; this doesn't include the monthly standing charge.  I want to see what I can do to reduce the amount we are using, and to see if I can find a cheaper supplier.  I have looked a couple of times, and got cheaper unit rates and then been stung with a higher standing charge, so I am being very wary.I have changed our telephone to BT, but then the broadband has been a nightmare - it was ordered at the same time and has been cancelled twice by BT, and now the MAC has expired so I have had to ask my present company for a new one, which I am now waiting for.  I am afraid that I will be without broadband for a time whilst the handover eventually takes place as I had to give the company I am with a month's notice, which I did, and now it may not get taken over in time.......if it wasn't for the fact that BT is so much cheaper than the present arrangement, I would have told them where to go by now.  It has been very frustrating.  Because I am afraid of not having internet at all for a while, I can't put any of our stuff on eBay at the moment, and the EFG has quite a pile of odds and ends she wants to pass on to new homes.The EFG is doing her agony aunt bit tonight with a friend - that friend called last night at past 11pm, and they are chatting away now - the girl only lives half a mile up the road, and they could have got together in daylight, but she leaves it until this time of night to talk every time.  The YFG has been on the telephone several times today.  She was bored this morning, and called to see if I would fetch her home!!  I said no.  The pace of life there IS much slower, but I think it will be good for her to slow down for a couple of days, and have less stimulation to be constantly doing something.  Apparently she has been for a walk to the park with the FH this afternoon, helped him with some shopping and some gardening, and had a snooze on the sofa this evening, so it does sound as if she is catching up on some sleep, just like we did this morning.Tomorrow the EFG is having a tooth out, so I know she will be squeezing my hand hard whilst she is in the dentist's chair.

It was altogether a relaxed day, and it did us good.UJ is doing well; he is increasingly mobile, and getting around the house remarkably well.  The district/community nurses are keeping an eye on him regularly and seem to be saying that all is going in the right direction.We are missing the FH terribly here!  The house is not the same without him, and it has been very quiet here today whilst the girls have been at school, but I have had enough to do to keep me occupied, and I have even watched tv whilst I was shredding a huge heap of old papers!"},
{"title": "What a week it has been", "date": "Saturday 16 July 2011", "text": "It feels like it has been a really long week, because we have done so much, but on the other hand, it has flown by.  UJ went into hospital on Monday morning, and then Tuesday my dad visited him, my sister went in on Thursday and then the FH and EFG fetched him home last night.  I spoke to him on the phone daily to see how he was doing.Thursday the FH and I went to UJ's house to do a bit of preparation work for him coming home, and brought two chairs back to our house for the FH to work on them - they needed to be higher so he made a frame to put under each one to raise them up to the right height.  So UJ has a chair to sit on in the sitting room where the TV is, but also one in the living room, where much of the time is spent - he doesn't watch a lot of TV.  So I have also had gymnastics, school meetings and household and garden stuff to continue to do.  The garden is producing courgettes like mad, and I haven't had time to do things with them to preserve them, so I have just been giving them away at the moment.  There will be time to do more later!  The chickens are also giving us nearly two dozen eggs a day....I see courgette omelettes on the menu.The freezer at UJ's house now contains sweet and sour turkey, chicken curry, beef casserole, bolognese sauce and some sausages.  The meals are pretty much ready to defrost and heat, and all the FH has to do is prepare some potatoes and veg, or some rice or pasta to accompany the meat part of the meal.  The FH will be there with UJ for some time - at least whilst he is on crutches.  They are calling the house a home for retired gentlemen at the moment, and I am sure they will be fine there together.  My dad lives quite close by and will pop in on them often, and the girls and I are going back tomorrow for Sunday lunch.  Once school is finished next week, we will be able to spend more time there too."},
{"title": "Hip Hip Hooray", "date": "Tuesday 12 July 2011", "text": "A rather cheesy title, I do apologise - but UJ had his hip replacement operation yesterday and so far, it seems to have been successful.  He is in hospital in Cambridge and I am over 35 miles away, so I haven't been to see him yet, but my dad went in today and reports that he is \"nicely\" - so that is excellent news.  I spoke with UJ briefly on the ward telephone this morning, when he requested a bottle of orange squash to make the water more palatable, and he said that the pain from the op is bearable, but they are giving him plenty of medications.We are gearing up for him to possibly come home on Thursday or Friday, so we are going to his house on Thursday morning to do some jobs - make a bed for the FH, have a look in the cupboards and see what shopping I need to get in for him and UJ, and probably do some watering in the garden.  The FH also has to put some blocks under a chair for UJ to sit in so that it is higher and more comfortable for him.  I think that my sister may visit him tomorrow,  and I know my dad will be pleased to see him home again, as he has been worrying about him!  He is not my dad's brother, but they have known one another a very long time, through my mum, who was UJ's sister.  Home on the range, there are the earliest runner beans ready already!  They are a variety called Teeny Beany, and they are very small, but perfectly formed.  We had the first dwarf beans yesterday - and the courgettes - I am giving them away to anyone and everyone.  I took some to school on Friday, and last night I sent a visitor home with 4 and told him that if he didn't like them, he could give them to his neighbours!!"},
{"title": "Saying \"no\"", "date": "Sunday 10 July 2011", "text": "I've been practising saying \"no\" to things - and although I am not doing great, I have resisted getting involved in something new.  The girls are involved in Guides, and this weekend has been a key time that they have been expecting help - the parade on Saturday involved decorating a float in advance, organising costumes, chaperoning the float, and today - dismantling it all.  I would have got stuck in, and gladly helped, but I didn't.  I deliberated, and then I stood back and let others do it.  I have to say that it didn't feel great, and I do feel a bit guilty, but on the other hand, I know that if I give an inch, they will take a mile, and I don't have it to give.   However, I did help with the morning service today, and although there weren't a lot of the usual congregation there today, we had fun with the parable of the sower, and the prayers for Action For Children Sunday.  That is a charity associated with the Methodist church, and it does a lot of good work with children and families.The EFG isn't feeling great, so she and I are having a little Torchwood festival this afternoon, watching some DVDs in preparation for the new series, series 4, which is starting on Thursday evening.  To say we are looking forward to it would be an understatement...we have series 1 & 2 on DVD but I wasn't that impressed with series 3 which aired over 5 consecutive nights, so I haven't bought that (\"yet\" says the EFG).  It will be weird to have new characters in this series, as there are only 2 of the original cast members, Jack and Gwen, left.  And it seems to be moving to America as well, so that will add interest.  Any of you fans?You can guess that we are rather preoccupied with chicks at the moment here in the Fens!  Having about 29 of them (18 + 11) at early stages of development does rather concentrate the mind.  The 11 older ones have just spent their first night outside.  I left them in the run, but put a cloth over the roof to give them some protection - in case it rained - today I will be extending the run and giving them a wee house to go into at night.  It was too late to do that last night in the dark when I decided that last night would be the night!The 18 at the just-hatched stage need another box!  We usually keep them all together, but there are a few too many for comfort in there now that they are growing and moving around more, so today's job for them will be another clean out, and splitting half of them into another box.  So that I can put them all back together when they go out, each time I clean them out, I will mix them up, as otherwise they may form themselves into two distinct flocks and then fight when I bring them back together in a couple of weeks' time."},

{"title": "Raring to go!", "date": "Friday 8 July 2011", "text": "Today has felt like one of those days when you have done a day's work before breakfast!  I was up at 5.30am to get stuff done and the chickens fed and watered before leaving at 7.40am to take the EFG to her placement.  I dropped her off at 8.05 and continued to Asda - I don't go there often, but I bought her a pair of navy trousers there for her work experience, and now that I have turned them up (saving myself the £6 the local seamstress charges) she is wearing them and looking very smart.  I hoped to buy another pair, but the navy co-ordinates have been shipped out and black is now \"in\" so I had to settle for the same pair of trousers but in black.  I also picked up a couple of pairs of shorts and some strappy tops for the YFG, who has \"nothing\" to wear, apparently.  I found an orange Tshirt for her as well, as she is a carrot on a float in the village parade this weekend...Then I headed homeward and called in to the other town to drop the books off at the charity shop, whilst a policeman kindly looked the other way whilst I was parked where I shouldn't have been so I could lug the boxes into the shop.  A branch of the Co-op which deals with home electricals, homewares and clothes is closing down, and has a massive sale on, so I have had a quick look around in there, too.  Nothing too much purchased, apart from a few bits to put away for gifts and birthdays.All that, and I was home by 10am.  Have to admit to flaking a little since then!  Some lunch has been had, some emails read, a quick trip to school to sign a letter and to put a box of free courgettes in the staffroom - I have a glut already and hope that the staff will help themselves, and me, and take some home.  Must phone the water company to pay the bill, and then I am on cleaning duties for a little while.Money is a touchy subject here this week - the FH and I went to the optician's on Tuesday and came out with a bill for £355 between us for three pairs of glasses (two for him, one for me) and a sight test (me - FH doesn't pay because of his age - thank goodness!!).  He is having a pair of varifocals for reading and for playing music, and then a distance pair for driving, and I just need an updated pair as my prescription has changed.  The FH has vowed and declared that these have to last him out now!  He doesn't \"get\" that I have the money and that they are worth having; he is out of touch with prices and seems to think he should be able to get a pair of glasses for about £9.99.  I am finding this increasingly with the FH these days - because all our money is paid straight into the bank account and he doesn't see any of it (well, not often, anyway!) he seems to think we haven't got any....bless him!  I am saving hard from our regular income, and we are able to pay these bills, thankfully - it is two years since I had a pair of glasses, so at £145, they are costing me  pennies over £6 a month, and I wouldn't be able to do much without them.  Contact lenses would cost me about £30 a month if I wore them daily, so these glasses are a bargain in comparison, surely.Hoping everyone has a good weekend.Thursdays are generally \"at home\" days now - and that is what I did yesterday - stayed at home and enjoyed the feeling of not having to be anywhere or do anything!I spent a bit of time watching the chooks and counting them!  There are a dozen Copper Marans hybrids, a trio of Barred Plymouth Rock, 12 adult GPO, 11 adult Brown Sussex, 9 Light Sussex hens, and two older brown hens, one of which is Goldenburg.  Then there are a dozen GPO growers, 11 GPO at about 4 weeks old and 18 GPO at 3 days old.  Quite a few now - that makes a round 90 chooks.I had a little discarding/moving-on session as well, and I have liberated well over 30 books from my shelves, so there are a few gaps.  Most of them are going to the charity shops this morning, although I have kept back a few as-good-as-new titles to put in the raffles at chapel.  That felt good.  Must do more of that - and thin out my clothes too.This morning, I have to take the EFG to her work experience placement, about 15 miles away.  She usually gets a lift with a teacher I know who works at the school and lives in the village here, but she doesn't work Fridays, so the transport is down to us.  I am taking her, and the FH will fetch her home tonight.  She is enjoying the whole thing, and the children are lovely, she says.  They went on a whole school trip yesterday (small school!) to a multicultural festival.  There is a KS1 trip to Hunstanton next week, so she is hoping the rain stops by then..."},

The fertility rates may have gone up, perhaps - I have been feeding the chickens on breeders' pellets which are supposed to give them a health boost, so maybe that has had something to do with it.The light Sussex eggs arrived bright and early yesterday morning, but one of them was filthy.  I was not pleased to find such a dirty egg in the selection and thought twice about using it.  If I had planned to put it in the incubator in that state, I would have run the risk of introducing infections, so, although it is not recommended because of the impact on the hatch of the egg, I washed it.  I thought that was the lesser of the two evils - I may lose the potential chick from that egg, but I am preserving the cleanliness of the incubator's environment.The Barred Plymouth Rock eggs have yet to arrive.Pictures of the chicks coming soon - we took some on the EFG's phone last night."},

We can hope, though!"},

It means a lot to me to know that people I don't know in real life are caring enough to think about me like that.  Thank you.So, how am I?  Mostly up, sometimes a bit down.  More up than down, and feeling a little more energised this week, so let's hope it lasts.  Cheerful news - there is another hatch coming off in the incubator :-) The first chick has hatched already and I am sure that there will be more.  They should all be GPOs, but the chickens have been doing a touch of wife swapping, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are a few cross breeds in the hatch this time.  Must get the wire repaired!I have bought some Light Sussex and some Barred Plymouth Rock eggs from sellers on eBay so that the incubator can be refilled after this hatch.  There will be 24 eggs altogether so the incubator will be full - and it will be the last run for this season, I think.That GPO hen that went broody didn't get to sit properly, but she is still sitting in the nestbox.  She hasn't got any eggs, and she wouldn't have been a good broody as she is moving from one nestbox to another and frequently sits on nothing.....The Copper Marans are up to 9 eggs today from the dozen of them, so I am very pleased, and the egg numbers in general are up to about 23 a day!  I have been lucky today and sold 4 dozen eggs to friends and neighbours, so that is a bag of feed paid for.The EFG is on work experience this week - early starts - better go to bed now!  Will tell you about that another day."},

{"title": "Thoughts", "date": "Wednesday 29 June 2011", "text": "Unfortunately, I am not getting better and as usual, it has taken me a few days to work out that the majority of the symptoms indicate that I am suffering from stress or anxiety.  I am not depressed, as I know that feeling, and it is a little different, although I think it is a close cousin.  I am feeling overwhelmed and under a lot of pressure to do things, be places, etc etc and I really feel tonight that the only thing I want to do is stay at home and weed the garden!  Tonight, I want to just be a \"housewife\" and mother, and think of nothing else but my family, my house and my garden/chickens.  In a way, I want to move somewhere where I don't have any responsibilities and just be me, so that I can start again - it is very hard to say to people that you don't want to help them any more - and it isn't that I don't want to.  I can't give up all the things I have taken on overnight, and I know that there is a 6 week break from the school and the gym coming up, which is a good thing.  I sent my apologies to two school events tonight, and it is likely that I shall do the same tomorrow and Friday.  I may not go to a church meeting in the morning, either.  I may make a visit to the doctor next week for some happy pills, as I call them, which might help me to get through this episode - it's a while since I had one like this, but they have got more frequent this past year, and I haven't done anything about improving the situation, so perhaps it is time I should.The trouble is that this IS an illness, but it is an invisible one, and so people look at me and think I look OK and wonder why it is that I don't feel that I can do this, that or t'other.   UJ has a date for his hip operation - July 11th - which is a cancellation slot, we think!  He is really pleased at getting one so quickly, and the FH is happy to go and stay with him once he gets out of hospital.  I am thinking about some meals I can make and freeze so that all he has to do is pull them out, thaw and reheat, and maybe cook some veg or pasta or potatoes to go alongside the main part.  I don't want the FH to be too hard worked whilst he is there, as his poor old ankles will suffer with too much standing around, cooking.Gosh - what a rambling!!  The latest batch of chicks had their first day in the outdoor garden run today - and seemed very happy in the sunshine, although they are back in their box in the verandah for the night now.  The older batch are now in the runs at the top of the garden and getting the hang of that lifestyle - if it rains, one has to go into the house, and they didn't grasp that yesterday when the heavens opened, so they got drenched - they'll learn!And Murray is through to the semi-finals at Wimbledon - hurrah!  The other chap just seemed to give up right at the end when it was Murray's service - he just let all the balls go right past him.  The girls have a day off school tomorrow because of the strikes, so the YFG has a friend here for the night, as we are looking after her tomorrow.  They are going to have a great time as they get on very well together."},
{"title": "Not such a great weekend", "date": "Sunday 26 June 2011", "text": "Saturday morning went fine, and we stayed an extra hour at the gym to give the competition girls a little longer to work on their routines and vaults for the comp next Saturday.  We got home about 2.20pm, and had a drink, got changed and started to get ready to go out again, as the EFG has some trousers that need turning up, and she needs another pair of school trousers, when I was hit with the most appalling stomach pains.  I was in agony, didn't know which end would explode first, and was just doubled over in pain.  The sweat was pouring off me, I was dizzy and couldn't see...and the FH had gone out!  The YFG was looking after me, and I told her at one stage that if I fainted, she should get help!!  The pains kept coming for the best part of an hour, and then gradually began to subside, with no explosions happening at all.  I fell asleep after that, and mostly stayed asleep until about 10am this morning.Today I didn't do much at all to start with.  The EFG dealt with the washing, and fed the chooks, whilst the FH went to chapel.  Then he and the YFG nipped up to the local car boot sale, where I hoped that they would be able to buy some fruit and veg.  The person selling it wasn't there by the time they found his usual plot, so we think he left early.  That meant that I had to gather my energies and go to the shops.  The FH drove us, and I managed to walk around by holding on to the trolley and feeling about 80!Tonight, now that it has cooled down, I have done a little more outside - picked the red gooseberries, hung out more washing, watered the greenhouse and the beans, cleaned out the chicks, etc, so I am feeling a lot better than I was, but I can do without episodes like that, thank you very much!!"},
{"title": "Meant well mix up", "date": "Friday 24 June 2011", "text": "We have a problem with the washing machine in the utility room at the moment, so the FH plumbed in a spare one that a neighbour gave us, but that one is in the workshop, down the yard.I have had several loads of washing to do today, and when I went out this afternoon to gym, there were still two baskets of washing to be done, left in the utility room.Imagine my surprise to come home tonight and find all the washing ironed and piled neatly on the table - including the bed linen I knew I hadn't washed yet.  Yes - the FH had ironed it for me - bless him and his good intentions - but it all has to go in the washer in the morning!!"},
{"title": "Time's a wasting!", "date": "Thursday 23 June 2011", "text": "I was bitten on the bum, so to speak, yesterday when someone whose opinions I respect, told me that he had had enough of people telling me that they hadn't got time to do something.  He explained that we all have the same amount of time, and that there are some jobs where you will never get everything done, or get the job finished, so you must decide what your priorities are, and do those things first.  If there is time left over, by all means do the things lower down the list.So I thought about that last night, and cancelled something this afternoon which was actually not that important that I attend, so I stayed at home and did some things here - taxed my car, paid some bills, changed my internet/phone provider, cleaned my oven, sorted some paperwork out for tomorrow, did some washing etc.  All things I had been putting off for a little while...Thursday would be a good day for me to say, \"no\" to a lot of things and have as an \"at home\" day, because I don't have to go out until 3.30pm and then only for about an hour to take the YFG and her friend to their piano lessons.  I think I may begin to plan that as a day at home, when I can put housework and gardening at the top of the list.Next Thursday the girls' school is going to close because of the proposed teachers' strike.  I'm not politically minded, and the last time the FH was a teacher and there was a strike, he went in anyway and did some prep work to make use of the time, so we are hardly qualified to comment on that situation.  As Chair of Governors at a primary school, the headteacher I am working with now has a constant question he uses when he is making a decision - \"What is best for the children?\" and I am fast coming to the conclusion that he is right (I know he is right - the school he usually runs is \"outstanding\" so he knows what he is talking about and I am very lucky to have him half the week!) and that with that as the central focus, we should be on the right track, so on that basis, I don't think striking is a good thing, because it is not what is best for the children.  Losing a day's education can't be best.  I am relieved that none of our teachers are going to strike, so the school here will remain open.  Whatever my thoughts, however, I am totally aware that everyone has their own opinion, so you are entitled to disagree - and I am sure some of you will!!The new black hens are laying - and I am so pleased.  We have been getting the odd egg now and again over the past two weeks, but both yesterday and today we got 5 and they are beautiful brown eggs - quite petite so far, but pullet eggs often are.  They are getting into the swing of it now and I am hoping that with 12 of them, we should be getting about 8 - 10 eggs a day eventually - fingers crossed."},

We just can't do it at the moment - and for such an extended period.  When I weighed up the health consequences, it wasn't right - we could keep going on what we have in stock, but it wouldn't be a very balanced diet at all!!  We have still got a lot of meat in the freezer, but we need to buy more fresh food on a more regular basis than we have done over the past almost three weeks.  By fresh food, I mean raw food, I suppose - carrots, apples, grapes, etc that I can use for lunchboxes and snacking - too many snacks were being eaten from the wrong food groups!BUT I have managed to get about £200 put away, and I haven't done a \"big\" shop yet.  I have still, as I said, got plenty of food in the house, but it just needs to be supplemented.  I will have to go shopping at some point, probably today, because the lunch boxes were a mighty struggle this morning, and it defeats the object if child B asks for money to buy a fruit bag from the canteen!So, challenge abandoned for now, but new lessons learned - and it does not mean a licence to go mad in the shops - I will continue to buy just what we need for the next few weeks, so that I can put more money in the savings, and then I will go back to building the stores up for the winter - the longest day is here today, so the tide is turning again, back towards the winter.  Can't believe it is the longest day already!!"},

I have been driving past this field regularly for weeks, and forgetting the camera, so last week, I stopped the car and asked the EFG to take a picture on her phone - and here it is.  I think the woman walking the dog along the riverbank wondered what we were up to.It is just a wide strip of rough ground between the field and the river where all these poppies have sprung up - perhaps a drain was dredged and the sediment put there, I'm not sure, but they do look glorious at the moment."},

We drooled, politely..A pensive Golden Guernsey goat in the RBST tent.  The EFG went around taking the pictures whilst the YFG and I were doing a quiz.  We got all the answers right, of course, and were rewarded with a small prize; I think the YFG chose a pen.  It was interesting, and I may join the RBST eventually...Miniature llamas, related to camels, funny looking giraffes - all comments I heard children make near these lovely alpacas.  They aren't very big at all and seemed quite docile, but the FGs were concerned that they might spit, so we didn't get too close!They loved eating from the hay in their rack.I'm ashamed to say that I have forgotten which breed of pigs these piglets were there to represent in the RBST tent.  They were there with their mum, and when we went in, they were all fast asleep for their afternoon nap, including mum!Apart from all of that, the FH watched the White Helmets, the Royal Signals motorbike display team, and we all had a good mooch around.The YFG took part in a grand cookery section where over a hundred children took part at a time!  There were four timed slots, each with about 105 children, and she got into the last one at 3pm.  They each made their very own strawberry, apple and rhubarb crumble, and then did some activities whilst they cooked, and came away with a cooked crumble and some Rhodda's clotted cream, with a goody bag too.  She enjoyed that.A little shopping was done too...best not to say too much about that as I bought a number of gifts which I shall keep quiet about until the birthdays have passed!We bought some Highland beef burgers for our tea, which I made when we got in, with some oven chips.  They were very meaty and the folks liked them.  My dad came over this evening with his holiday photos and some small gifts for the girls, including the chocolates which his cabin steward left on his pillow each evening - he saved them up and brought them for the girls!Hope you have all had a good weekend."},
{"title": "Thanks for the end of the week", "date": "Friday 17 June 2011", "text": "That was a long week, and it has had its ups and downs.  A friend on the phone in tears this afternoon broke my heart, and I feel so helpless that there is nothing I can do to help her in her particular situation, but she had family on the way to be with her, and just needed someone to talk to whilst they travelled to her side.  She is in a really tough place, and I wanted to go to her and give her a big hug!  She'll be in my thoughts and prayers now.It's raining again - I feel like doing the rain dance to celebrate the garden getting a fantastic soaking tonight.  The ground was like dust and it so needs this moisture for the beans and courgettes in particular.  It wasn't so much fun for the EFG who got rather wet when she went out to shut up the chook houses tonight.  This weekend is the East of England show, and I have some tickets, so I am really hoping for a fine-ish day on Sunday so that we can nip to Peterborough and have a good poke around the show.  Since it is Father's Day, I thought that it would be a good day out that the FH would enjoy. We are watching the weather forecasts closely to see whether it will be a goer or not.  Fingers crossed.The weeks are counting down to another gymnastics competition on 2nd July, so we are working hard on routines for that.  It is a fairly local competition, but we haven't entered it for several years (OK, four years!) so I am not sure what the level of the other entries will be like - I think I am more nervous for the children than they are.  But before that on the 26 June, I am going to go to Stevenage to watch a competition in which we have no entrants this year, but which we hope to enter next year - if I can go along this year and suss it out!!  Should be interesting, and it is to be held at a very good gym facility so I am going to be going green with envy at the equipment, I just know.Hope you all have a lovely weekend, whatever you are doing."},
{"title": "Blackcurrants - an experiment", "date": "Wednesday 15 June 2011", "text": "The load of blackcurrants which we were given yesterday amounted to 1.7kg.  You would hope that after boiling them, straining them through a jelly bag, adding 500g of sugar and boiling for a further 20 minutes or so, one would end up with several jars of jelly to put in the storecupboard.  Some hope.  I have achieved two jars - one of 350g and one of 200g, and it is extremely thick and well set.  Tastes OK but I think next time, I'll stick to jam: less effort and more reward!The YFG was up at 4am with a headache, and feeling sick, so she had a day at home today: we watched St Trinian's DVD whilst I did the ironing.  She slept some, and rested so she will be back to school tomorrow, and her after-school piano lesson."},
{"title": "Blogger madness and eggs", "date": "Tuesday 14 June 2011", "text": "The stats page is now regularly showing more than 200 pageviews a day - that's not sensible!Eggs: well, I have loaded the incubator up this morning with another two dozen GPO eggs, and then one of the dear GPOs has gone broody on me!  She was in the nest box yesterday when I went for the eggs, and then she was still there at bedtime last night, so I had my suspicions, but they have been confirmed today as she has sat there, quite tightly, all day....so now I have a conundrum - to let her sit or not?  Will consider that, and report back later in the week.The stores are getting depleted already!  It is the basic, everyday items which we are running out of first: the squash is finished, so they are having to drink water or hot chocolate; the last tin of tuna was eaten yesterday and that is all the tinned fish finished (try saying that quickly!); the last pack of UHT milk has been opened so then we will be moving on to the dried, but whether to tell them that, or just to make it up and put it in a jug...mmm..not sure about that one yet.  Space is developing in the freezer - although the FH took up bartering at the weekend and gave away two jars of honey in exchange for two pounds of sausages and 2 packs of 8 pork burgers - I think we got the best end of that deal somehow.  There is still a lot of chicken in there.The YFG was hunting around last night for a snack and said, \"There's nothing to eat!\" and I resisted the temptation to say too much, but then she came back and asked if she could make some cakes!  She made a batch of carrot buns, which have helped to pad out the lunchboxes this morning.Tonight's supper is looking OK though - they are having some of the sausages, and I will have some frozen white fish (steamed in a parcel with lemon juice, over the potatoes) with said potatoes and a selection of vegetables from the freezer.  I think that I may try some kind of suet pudding with a pack of ready mix from Approved Foods - we have loads of jam, after all, and it will fill them up till bedtime.We were given a couple of bunches of beetroot yesterday, so that is going to necessitate the purchase of some vinegar for pickling, unless I can magically find some in the back of a cupboard. The same kind benefactor also brought a bag of blackcurrants, which the FH said we should put in the freezer.  I declined and asked him to top and tail them for me whilst I am out and then I can try out the jelly bag which UJ lent me, and see if I can produce blackcurrant jelly - I think it would be nice on the side with meat, a bit like cranberry jelly, perhaps.  If that fails, I am sure it would be OK on toast.And so, with all this creativity, have I put money into the savings account?  N.O.  This has come along at the right time, though, as I have had to spend £30 on printer ink and £60 on new clothes for the EFG.  The EFG and clothes have a serious love-hate relationship.  She hates most clothes and then when she finds something she likes, she loves it to death, wears it out, and wants a replacement exactly the same...so I sometimes buy more than one.  She tends to get paint on her clothes, or stains of various kinds, so she can be a nightmare to take out because she will end up wearing jeans and some kind of top time and time again.  I love her to bits, whatever she wears!  But, the time has come when she has to smarten up and have some decent clothing to go out in: she had an interview yesterday for work experience, at a school, and she has to go in her own clothes each day, looking \"smart casual\".  Challenge.......She's a larger young person, but she is short...really quite short...not an average shape...she's an individual, as we all are.  So we went to Asda, and hit the jackpot - some \"smart casual\" clothes which co-ordinate.  She chose some lovely navy blue based separates, including a pair of navy trousers, so what with her school trousers and a blouse she already had, I think we can squeak through 10 days of work experience with enough outfits to give me time to wash them in between wears, if you see what I mean.  Must get the trousers turned up before July, though!!  So, although I have had a major expense this week, it hasn't hit us hard as we have cut back elsewhere, as we had planned, and this has compensated adequately.  Maybe we will get some money saved in the bank next week."},

We thought a couple of them were panting as they were too warm, so we lifted the heat lamp up a little.  Big mistake.  Within an hour, one had died, and two more were on the edge, so I put them back into the incubator to warm up.  One of those two has since died too, and the other is teetering.The FH has had a damp day at his show, but an interesting one, and has met lots of new people.  The girls and I have been busy in a lot of ways, here and there, and that is all I am saying for tonight - I am SOOO tired!  Good night!Parts of the Anglia region have officially been declared a drought region because of the extremely low levels of moisture in the soil, and I can quite believe it - parts of the garden are like dust if we don't keep it all watered well.  I am making good use of the water butt and my trusty watering can.  Still, there was a very heavy downpour on Friday night but there is no evidence of that rain left - the dry weather since has evaporated all that moisture, it would appear.  The weather forecast which was given a few days ago for today said that it would rain heavily here today in a prolonged manner - we can hope!  Although the FH is having a little demonstration area with his beekeeping stuff at a local farm for Open Farm Sunday, so I suppose I had better not hope for rain, for his sake.I am cooking a chicken for tonight's supper in the slow cooker.  Last night I made Toad in the Hole in the Remoska, and I am making a real effort to make economical use of the oven, or to keep it turned off.  Rather than leave the computer on all day if I am home so that I can pop on and off for 5 minutes here and there, I am coming and having a quick look and then turning it all off.  Why? Because we are using about £70 of electricity a month at the moment, and it has got to be reduced!!Had to buy potatoes and apples yesterday so I will dig out the receipt later and bring my spending total up to date."},

I thought I would be rather pleased to get to 100 in a day, and so I thought that would be something to aim for.  88 came and went some time ago, but it never stretched any higher than that, and with being away last week, I dipped quite low as there was nothing new to read.Then, wham!  All of a sudden, yesterday, 164 pageviews!  164 - almost double the previous high!I did a little dance!I squealed!Then I sat down and thought about how that had happened, and I can only think that the post about \"Poor kids\" really touched a nerve somewhere.  It had touched me, and others were interested to read it too, I suppose.  So, actually, after all my excitement, I wasn't that pleased to get a high page view count on the day I wrote about childhood poverty in the UK.  But if a few more people go and watch the programme on iPlayer because of what I wrote, I guess it did some good.PS In that case, could I have some more Followers, please?"},
{"title": "How does your garden grow?", "date": "Wednesday 8 June 2011", "text": "There are no pretty maids here, just runner beans!  This is the runner bean support we have made out of the old swing which we were given - I am hoping that it will be sturdy enough to stand up to the wind.  My teepee arrangements usually end up blowing over at some point each summer... On the right you can see the little row of lettuces which I bought and planted yesterday - they are \"Little Gem\".These are the lettuces I am growing from seed - one lot of them, anyway: there is another batch at a lesser stage of development.And these I bought and planted earlier in the season - they seem to have come on all of a sudden.  I think we may start to eat them this weekend.I have no idea if this will work, but I planted the dwarf beans in clumps this year, instead of the rows I usually use.  They were certainly easier to plant, but whether it will have any effect on the outcome, we'll have to let you know later.These are the courgettes, with a rogue sunflower, a couple of marigolds and a petunia just lurking in the bottom corner there.  This bed looks empty at the moment, but when those courgettes take off, it will soon look overcrowded!There is less hurry clearing the remaining bed now, as the curly kale and sprouting broccoli seedlings have all died.  That happened with the kale last year, and I don't understand why.  They get to a certain stage, and then keel over.  I am going to sow more kale, but I am giving up on the broccoli!How's your garden looking?There was a documentary on last night, called \"Poor Kids\".  That link will take you to the BBC website where you can watch a clip, although the whole thing must be on iPlayer as well.Gosh, it was shocking.  We talk about how \"the other half\" live, but society can't be delineated as easily as that.  \"The other half\" are usually richer than us, when we use that expression, but we aren't really poor.  Not compared to those children, and the millions like them, IN BRITAIN TODAY.  That is what got me.  I understand poor children in Africa, or in Asia, for example, who have no food because the harvest has failed or there has been a drought, or a civil war; I have seen the pictures of people desperate for the sacks of provisions being flung out of the planes, I know about them living hand to mouth, one meal a day, walking miles to get water.  I understand that kind of poverty.These children were living in Leicester, Bradford and Glasgow.  Leicester is less than 100 miles from here, and I know Glasgow only a little, from what I saw on the hospital trips when the FH was in the Royal Infirmary.  I know the Gorbals by reputation.There is a child on the programme who is sitting on her bed, eating some kind of large sausage roll, and that is her tea.  She explains that quite often she doesn't get any dinner unless she is at school where there is a free school meal for her.  Breakfast? She says she often \"forgets\" to make herself some toast, or she runs out of time.  And the housing.  The Gorbals area of Glasgow is a tenement maze, where hundreds of thousands of people must live in a very small area, piled up in blocks.  There were rooms where the whole ceilings are covered in mould, the mattresses on which the children were sleeping were mouldy, and they had asthma and other health issues.  Another child and her siblings, one very young, were playing outside, and running from one boarded-up house to another, trying to gain entry so that they had somewhere to play.  She explained quite sadly that if she went home, it was quite boring, as all there was to do was watch the television - she said that other people had colouring and toys and puzzles, but they just have the tv.  I really counted my blessings last night.  Really.I may not have the money that would allow us foreign holidays, posh cars and fancy clothes, but we have got it made compared with those children.  We are rich by comparison, and our children have a life those \"poor kids\" would love, and they would be grateful because they have known life without.  I didn't see that part, but apparently a child at the end said that she didn't want to grow up - perhaps because she had seen what living like that had done to her mother.How did it make me feel?  Well, I vowed to double my annual donation to the Salvation Army because I know that the SA supports people like those, especially children.  I also thought about supporting more home charities.  It also made me start to think about the kinds of places I want to work if I ever make it into the ministry.  One think it did for sure, though, was to really open my eyes to true poverty in this country."},

They are safely planted in the garden now, and are intended to \"plug\" (sorry!) the gap between the ones I bought earlier in the season, which will be ready in a week or two, and the seedlings which won't be ready for ages!  Can't quite get the hang of this succession sowing lark yet!So, total so far - £1.60 + £9.74 + £1 = £12.34£100 divided by the seven weeks is only £14 a week, so I am hoping that I am done shopping for this week!!Tonight the FH will be cooking whilst we are at the gym and he has corned beef hash on the menu - corned beef from the storecupboard stash, to which he will add sweet potatoes and courgettes from the fridge, an onion and from the freezer, he will have to defrost some tomatoes.  There are also potatoes left from the holiday which I think he will probably use up tonight.I think that we will be eating more rice and pasta meals, as I have loads of that in stock, rather than quite as many potatoes as we have had lately.There is quite a lot of chicken in the freezer so if anyone has any interesting but cheap chicken meals to share, I'm interested!"},

{"title": "Day 1 disaster!", "date": "Monday 6 June 2011", "text": "I am £1.60 down already and not a lot to show for it!  UJ had a loaf of bread open whilst he was here looking after everything, and I went to it this morning to make a sandwich for the YFG's lunchbox.  I made the sandwich, cut the crusts off as she likes, and passed over the lunchbox to her to put in her bag.  The loaf of bread sat very demurely on the side, and never gave a clue.  Three minutes before she was due to go, I picked up the loaf of bread to get to something behind it, and wham! A HUGE black patch of mould was lurking the other side of the loaf.........I had to grab the sandwich out of the lunchbox and hand over enough cash to enable her to buy a baguette or wrap from the cafeteria at school.  The bread I made the sandwich from actually looked fine, but if she had eaten it and become ill, I wouldn't have forgiven myself, so I paid up.  Lesson of the day - check the bread earlier when you want to make sandwiches so that you have time to get more out of the freezer if necessary.Tonight, the gang have had a minced beef and onion pie, potatoes and cabbage, and I have had a similar concoction, but with cold roast beef left over from yesterday instead of the pie.I haven't had a chance to look at the stores yet today - it's been a busy day!  Quick trip to school, and chat with the Head, meeting at chapel about the holiday club, lunch, knitting whilst watching the news, paperwork, washing, bit of tidying etc, a friend came round for a chat, and then cooking the tea.  I'm off now to clear up the kitchen and bring in some washing, and then I should have time to consider the options for the week.  Lunchbox food is going to be a Challenge in itself!"},
{"title": "And the challenge begins.......", "date": "Sunday 5 June 2011", "text": "Tomorrow sees us begin the £100 challenge for the half-term until the girls break up from school on the 22nd July.  I mentioned it back here and the time has come to begin tomorrow.  At some point tomorrow, I will be investigating the stocks in the freezers and storecupboards, and looking for some recipes to make a menu plan up for the week.  It would be fun to use up what we have in stock, and to try out some new recipes.  I may look around food.com (which used to be recipezaar) as well as allrecipes which is also a good place to browse.  I also have a couple of magazines to check through, and then there are the Sainsbury's £50 week menu planners here.  I'll post the ideas and the shopping list for the week - which needs to be absolutely minimal!!The garden is looking promising and by the end of the challenge in July, I hope to be harvesting courgettes, tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers too, which will help with the fresh veg situation.  Other stuff will follow later in the year which will keep our general costs down too.  Great news tonight - it is raining!!!  The ground really needs the rain, and it is forecast to rain for a couple of days, so I must really focus on how much the rain is needed and not worry about getting the mountain of washing dry which I brought back from the holiday - it can wait.  The sun will shine again.The last remaining Dutch bantam, Leah, died this afternoon.  She had been looking a little tired and sad for a few days, and not really \"mothering\" her chicks as well as she would usually have done, and I gave her some corn at lunchtime, but she had keeled over by 5pm.  Both of the chicks cheeped rather sadly when I removed her body from the run, and they have gone to bed tonight together, so I hope that they will huddle up and keep each other warm.I have lost count of the number of broods Leah raised for us, and even of how old she may have been, but I would guess at five or even six years of age - a good few years for a chook, anyway.  She had a happy life here, and spent some time with my friend Helen when Helen took a group of Dutch bantams over for me, but when Leah was the only one left, she was returned to us to be with her sister, Lana.  Lana passed away in the chill months of last winter, and Leah has lived long enough to see in the spring and early summer, and to raise another batch of chicks.  She was a lovely bantam, and will be much missed."},

We slept late most days, watched Britain's Got Talent every night, and then went to bed!  The girls and the FH did some walking most days, and they went to Holt, and then I went with them to Cromer and Sheringham on various different excursions; we have done some shopping....The weather has been great, and we have come home to find that UJ has done a great job of holding the fort here, too.

{"title": "Soft refreshing rain", "date": "Monday 30 May 2011", "text": "The garden plants must be rejoicing!  It has been raining steadily all day, a soft persistent rain which is soaking into the parched, cracked ground here, and I am really hoping that it will do a lot of good!  Yesterday, I finally planted the dwarf French beans, the rhubarb, Marigolds and some garlic, so they will all be benefiting from the rain today.  I really enjoyed spending the afternoon in the garden yesterday - I managed to do lots of odd jobs as well as the planting, and I did several loads of washing.  It was a funny day weather-wise, as dark clouds kept looming and then blew over in the strong winds, so it didn't actually rain all day, and when the sun broke through the clouds, it was really quite warm.Today has been all about housework as UJ is coming in the morning to stay for the rest of the week whilst we go away to the Norfolk coast.  The house is now presentable, and I am just going to make a cake to leave for him, and then I will be satisfied!  We are really looking forward to these few days away, and hoping for good weather.  It won't matter particularly if the weather isn't great, as we have packed books, DVDs and some homework to fill in the gaps!  We will get out and about whatever the weather, so I hope to bring you some decent photos when we get back.  Have a good week, wherever you are and we'll be back at the weekend.  Cheerio!"},
{"title": "Bats and buzzing", "date": "Saturday 28 May 2011", "text": "Tonight we have been really excited to see two bats flying around the front of the house for a good quarter of an hour!  Neighbours elsewhere on the estate have reported seeing bats near their houses before, but we haven't been so lucky before tonight.  The buzzing - well, I concentrate mostly on growing vegetables, but with the longstanding bee crisis that this country and others are facing, I decided that I really ought to do more for the bees, and I bought some little flower plug plants to put in amongst the veg - marigolds and petunias.  Not sure about the companionability of petunias, but I know marigolds are good for veg!Yesterday morning's coffee session at the chapel raised a fab £200 for the funds, and I sold off some of my books - ones that were in good condition so that rather than donate them all to the charity shops, I offered them for sale - many had only been read a couple of times, so I was pleased to get a £1 each for them.  I came home with some ice cream money for the holiday next week, and made a donation to the chapel from the takings as well, so we were all pleased.  Another lady donated a load of plants for sale - which is where my marigolds and petunias came from.  I have been to the chook food shop to stock up for next week, whilst UJ is in charge, and I also nipped into the library and borrowed three books for the holiday too.  I have a mountain of ironing to plough through tomorrow so that I can pack on Monday!  I need to get the school uniforms washed and dried tomorrow as well as we won't have a lot of time when we get back to do them - and I must organise a service for next Sunday as well!I'd better be off to bed - we have had visitors here tonight - two children whilst their parents went out for the evening, so the little girl has been on the computer with the YFG and the little boy has been watching a DVD of the Robin Hood series with Jonas Armstrong, which he has loved!  They also played a few board games earlier on, and had some snacks so I think they wouldn't mind coming back another time!  The EFG made some lemon buns tonight, too, so people had to have a wee taste of those too."},

Then I had to scramble round to get the rest of the jobs done before I left at 3pm to pick up the YFG and take her to her piano lesson.  Tonight I have done some baking for a church coffee morning tomorrow - cheese scones and a lemon loaf cake - and I have waited up for the EFG to come home, as she has been out with a friend from school.  Now I am off back to bed!"},
{"title": "Challenges ahead", "date": "Wednesday 25 May 2011", "text": "I am still considering my \"40 things to do before I am 40\" list, and it is coming along nicely.  I do have to fill it up a little more, though, before I share it.  Just can't quite get the last few spaces filled yet...We are also getting lined up to do a Grocery Challenge when we come back from the holiday at half-term.  The girls and I are looking at the rules, and have so far decided that we will be going from the 6th June to the 22nd July, so that is the rest of the school term.  They are on board, which is always a bonus!  There will be 7 weeks, or 47 days as it starts on a Monday and ends on a Friday, and we will have £100.  We will be eating what we have in the storecupboards and freezers, what we can grow and what we are given!  I have to say that we never actually ask for anything, but UJ rarely comes here empty-handed!  To be fair, he often goes home with some eggs or a cake, or a dinner, so he gets something in return.  I will not be buying extra food to stash away in the meantime, but will just be buying the usual bits and pieces.  I will have to do some shopping this weekend to make sure that UJ has everything he likes whilst he is here chicken-sitting, and then the challenge will begin when we go back to school after the holiday.The £100 will be for food.  Other purchases are kept to an absolute minimum during challenges, considered on a \"do you really have to have that? isn't there something else you could use?\" basis, and there will be no book/toy/game/DVD/entertainment purchases whatsoever.  No clothes, shoes, household items, extravagances of any kind.Why?  Because we can, because we have lots of stores and we could do with using some of it up to free some space in the freezers for this year's produce, because it will save us about £500 or more in cold hard cash in the bank, which can be saved!  I will be keeping track of how much is put in the savings account, and will post it as we go through.  I will also be posting shopping lists and menus, so i can keep track of what we are eating, and hopefully that what we are eating is still relatively balanced.  I will be doing an inventory before we start, but I won't be posting that as it is bound to run to pages and pages - we have a lot of stores!The other reason for doing this now is that we have some big bills coming up, and they just have to be paid!  June sees the Vectra needing a new tax disc at £210, July brings the Volvo's turn at £215, and the TV license as well at £145.50, and the RAC membership too.  I looked at paying for the RAC with Tesco clubcard vouchers, but they want £58 in vouchers for the membership we have, and I can do more interesting things with the children with those!  I do put money aside for the big bills each month, but the Vectra has come at the wrong time of year for the plan that I have had for several years - the previous Astra was always taxed in January, but I bought the Vectra in December with six months' tax on it, so it has moved the time of year!  Time to change the plan..."},
{"title": "It rained!", "date": "Monday 23 May 2011", "text": "And I got drenched in a couple of minutes!  The baby chicks were out there and I had to race out and fetch them in under the verandah as they are too young to get that wet, so it was me who took the brunt of the showers whilst I was bringing them in.  This dry spring weather is causing some problems for the farmers and crop growers around here, and my garden has been in danger of blowing away as the soil is so dry and fine that it was just like dust!  The rain has dampened it down so it should stick around a while longer, I hope.I am saddened tonight to hear that this storm which has passed over the UK in the last couple of days, with very strong winds, has killed a couple of people.  There has been a lot of damage done, and other people have been lucky to escape with minor injuries when trees have fallen onto trains and cars.  Travel has been widely disrupted across Scotland and the north of England, with bridges closed due to the high winds, trains not running because of debris on the tracks and roads closed or slow because of accidents.  I spent over an hour on the phone this morning trying to sort out the electricity companies.  We were sent a big \"final\" bill by our utility company because they were closing our account, as they thought that we wanted another company to take over our supply.  It was an \"erroneous transfer\" due to the fact that the national database of electricity supplies has not been updated since these houses were built, still using the plot numbers.  So when a neighbour asked for her supply to be moved to another company, instead of taking the supply relating to her house number, they took the supply relating to my old plot number, which happen to be the same!  I think we are heading towards the light at the end of the tunnel, but it is a hassle to get it all sorted out.  Tonight has been a leftover night - the FH and EFG had the sausage plait cold tonight with various side dishes and pickles, and the YFG had a tin of her absolute favourite soup - Baxter's Highland Broth.  She loves the stuff, but it has to be a rare treat as it is expensive! I made a quick vegetable risotto for my supper as I can't eat the sausage plait.  They all had their meals after band practise tonight; one of the band leaders died and there is a big funeral tomorrow where people are coming from bands all over the area to play at the funeral, so the FH will be going along.  The man was in his senior years, but died after a long battle with cancer.  He will be much missed in the village.  The holiday issues have been resolved and we can stay until the Saturday so we are all pleased!  I will be going to the library later in the week to choose some books to take along, and I will also be looking to dig out my knitting needles to carry on with my squares.  I plan to do some studying whilst we are away as well, as there will be less distractions!  Just hoping that the weather goes back to the warm and sunny stuff we have been enjoying, but somehow I fear that it might just tip down a month's worth of rain instead, since I have been praying for rain for the garden - you do have to be careful what you ask for!!"},
{"title": "Top post", "date": "Sunday 22 May 2011", "text": "That post way back when for Sausage plait is still my top ranking post, with so many hits on a daily basis compared to anything else I have written!  So, guess what?  I made sausage plait for tea tonight.......no photos though as you all know what it looks like now.Today has been another Maggie day where I have been pleased with all that we have achieved.  The morning service went very well which was a relief as I had had visions of it being a disaster!  The other lady that I sometimes lead services with helped me today by taking on a part of the service that I usually do and that took a bit of the pressure off me, but then I did a different part for a change, so it all worked out well.  I had a group of children reading the Three Little Pigs story about the houses made of straw, sticks and bricks, because the text for the day was from 1 Peter 2:2-10 where it says we are to be like living stones, and the whole service was about stones!  So I drew a parallel with the house of bricks in the story, telling the children that the little pigs were living safely in the brick house as we can live safely and securely sheltered by our faith in Jesus which is represented by the bricks/stones in the Bible text.  The house is solid and secure, just like our faith.  After church, I put my feet up for half an hour and had a cup of tea and a snack, before I started on the garden.  It has been fine all day, and I hung washing out on the line, but it has been so windy here that I have really been thinking about my friends in Scotland (all of you - all over the place!) where much much stronger winds were forecast.  I hope no one has any structural damage.  In the garden I finished weeding another raised bed, and then planted some cobnut squashes and the runner beans.  These are a variety called Czar which I bought from the Real Seed catalogue, and they are growing into lovely strong plants.  We have an old swing and we are using the frame to add stability to the bean poles as they have been blown over several times in past years.  I am really hoping that they stay upright this year.  I have also pricked out some Little Gem lettuce seedlings (must sow some more!) and potted up some free tomato plants which arrived this week.  I think that they are called Tomazilla, not a variety I have heard of before, but free is always good so they were worth a go!After tea, I had a bath and then enjoyed watching the last episode of Vera with the FH for the evening's entertainment.  Have to admit that all the fresh air today has tired me out.  Day at home tomorrow so more gardening on the cards - always lots to do in the garden..."},

The blur in the photo is the wire of the run that they are in.  They are all doing well.These are the almost two-week old chicks which hatched in the incubator.  Today was their first day outside - the sun was shining and I thought they could do with some fresh air and sunshine; they loved it!They were a little timid when they first went outside but they soon got used to the grass and the colours of the outdoors.When they were warm, they would sit in the shade but they had a grand time, fluttering their wings and exploring the space.  They stayed outside until about 6pm, and now they are back in their box in the utility room for the night.  They are done with the heat lamp now.  They are very healthy-looking chicks, eating well and growing feathers fast!"},
{"title": "Just a little rant!", "date": "Wednesday 18 May 2011", "text": "The Fens areas have quite a few Tesco stores: let's start in the north, with Wisbech, and then head south - March has two, there's one out at Downham Market, Ely has a large one, Huntingdon has an even bigger one with an upstairs area, there's another at Ramsey heading out west a little, and then there is the huge one at Bar Hill, much closer to Cambridge but still within reasonable travelling distance.  Other supermarkets don't get much of a look-in round here; there is an Asda at Wisbech and a Sainsbury in March, a Morrison's at Downham Market and a Waitrose at Ely.  That is about it.  Obviously Tesco has a monopoly in this area - and the other week the newspaper reports that there is to be yet another one, in the market town of Chatteris.  Why would the local people need yet another one?  It would surely have been more appropriate to have brought in some competition - an Asda or a Morrison's would have been much better and given more people a wider choice within their area.  The paper was full of letters last week from local people who are complaining about it.  I am beginning to hate myself for succumbing to Tesco's wiles to get us into the store, but I feel that I have to weigh up the economies of shopping there against the stand I would like to make by shopping elsewhere.  I'm not really much good at making a stand as I am more driven by making the most of every penny for the children's sake.And that brings me to the next point.  £9K a year for 3 years, for two children: that is £750 a month for 6 consecutive years for their university education.  Can't do it.  Not a chance.  We have been talking about it lately, and whilst we are saving hard into funds for their future, we and they realise that those funds are going to have to help support them whilst they are studying rather than being the means by which we pay for the courses.  They realise that they will have to take out tuition fee loans in order to pay for the courses.Today we have had the official opening of the new KS1 building at the school.  My speech went off fine, and I was presented with a very post brass ceremonial key to symbolise the handing over of the building in to the care of the Governors.  It was a lovely day, and the opening was done by a local Fenland celebrity, a boxer called Dave \"Boy\" Green who was a British and European Welter weight champion in the seventies!A day at home tomorrow until I have to pick the girls up, so I will be doing a mountain of washing, watering plants, planting out some beans if the weather holds and starting a major clutterbusting session!  I am also hoping to get another batch of eggs set in the incubator Friday so I must disinfect it tomorrow and get it turned on to get up to the right temperature.  All go!"},

I know two people currently serving in Afghanistan - a neighbour is serving in Kandahar with the US military and the EFG's godmother's son is in Camp Bastion with the Royal Navy.  A bomb was found in Ireland this morning ahead of the Queen's visit, so whether it would have affected her or not, it could have killed others; the people of Japan are struggling to rebuild their shattered country; I have two dear friends currently being affected by mental health issues - I know that my problems are small fry compared to these!"},
{"title": "This week so far", "date": "Tuesday 17 May 2011", "text": "Tuesday already - again!  Wednesday will be here tomorrow [of course!] and the week will be half over - how quickly the days are passing.Sunday was a good day; we went to church, and then rushed home because the service went on longer than usual, and we had two lots of visitors coming, to whom we had said, \"Come any time after 11,\" so when the service finished at five to, I had to scurry the FH away from another cup of coffee.  We did manage a little breather before anyone arrived, though.UJ came to lunch, and the girls wanted lasagne, so I thought I would make some home-made garlic bread to go with it.  I put some French stick dough in the bread machine so that it was ready for me to roll out and leave to rise when we got home from church, and that was timed to perfection.  It rose beautifully and I cooked it and then let it cool.  Once I had the lasagne in the oven, I sliced the bread almost through, and spread each piece with some butter mixed with garlic, wrapped it all up in tinfoil and put it back in the oven.  With some steamed broccoli, we had a good feast.  We followed it up with some meringue nests [from the reduced section because one out of the pack of 8 had been crushed] topped with a tiny portion of squirty cream and some strawberries and mango.In between the meals, I did some more potting up and seed sowing, sitting in the verandah.  Leeks and brown onions, Sutherland kale and sprouting broccoli all made it to the next stage, and I sowed some new lettuce seed as the last lot hadn't come up at all - I think it was too old.In the evening, I watched \"Vera\" starring Brenda Blethyn [can't believe she is 65] and did the ironing.  Yesterday was also another busy day - washing, a bit of stuff to do on the computer, some housework, a quick trip to town to put some cheques in the bank and go to the tool shop for the FH, and get two watches repaired at the jeweller's shop - one dead battery and one broken strap. Last night I took the church treasurer to a meeting in a nearby village, and that was an eye-opening experience.  Once the minister had opened the meeting with a prayer, there was no mention of God or the Bible, of how God might help us to raise money or that we should be praying for guidance on the whole issues around the payments.  There are 15 churches in the circuit, and each has to pay an assessment to the circuit each year, in four quarterly payments.  There was a general malaise amongst the treasurers that they couldn't pay that amount - and it is all fair and in proportion so each church has to pay the same amount per member.  We always struggle a little to pay, but we do a lot of fundraising in the village and always manage to get the money together.  Our treasurer was quiet and let the others do the complaining as she felt we had nothing to complain about.  The other thing is that these churches expect to get grants from the circuit towards their big expenses - but they can't see that if they don't put the money in, they can't get any back out - it's not a bank where you can get an overdraft or loan!  The minister in charge kept asking if people wanted to say anything, but I was afraid to open my mouth as I was concerned that if I started, I wouldn't be able to stop!And so to today - gymnastics tonight.  I am hoping for an email from my sister today as she is mucking me about over the caravan on the coast again.  She did this a year or so ago and double booked it so that we couldn't go when we had arranged to go, hence our trip to Scotland last October.  This time I booked it for the school half-term in two weeks time, so that we would be able to go from the Tuesday to the Saturday.  Now she is telling me that she thinks she has told some man he can have it on the Friday night.  We are all very disappointed about that, and I have told her to find out for sure and let me know asap.  We were all looking forward to a good poke around on Sheringham Market on the Saturday morning and it was to have been one of the highlights of the break, so I hope she sorts it out in our favour.  I shall make her email me confirmation next time!"},

She is an excellent mum, and does so well with her broods each year.  It isn't her fault that only two of the four eggs hatched, and she will look after these two brilliantly, I'm sure.We were at gym last night, and then again this morning, and then we came straight home, not pottering about in the shops at all.  What a difference that makes to the afternoon - there really was an afternoon!  I had some lunch, had a bath, did some washing, planted out beans in the long troughs that the FH made last year so that the beans can grow up the trellis again [Climbing Blue Lake in one area and a Runner bean called Teenie Beanie in another section], finished weeding a raised bed for the onions, leeks and garlic to go out tomorrow if it is fine, fed the chickens, answered the phone a couple of times, had a cup of tea sitting in the shed watching the chickens.......it was lovely to be able to spend some time outdoors, mulling things over in my head, as well as doing something useful.Then the EFG presented herself to me with very itchy and red eyes, so I rounded up the troops, gathered together a couple of errands, and we went back to town.  I visited some friends on the way with a parcel for them, went to Focus to get some compost, and then went to Tesco for some Optrex and eye drops.   Tonight we have had a storecupboard/freezer dinner of sticky chicken with a vegetable rissotto.

She chose big achievements, like hot air ballooning in Namibia, driving alone on the motorway, losing weight, doing things and going places.  A lot of them weren't things I would choose, so I started to concoct my own list.

I had the oven on anyway to make home-made chicken nuggets and home-made baked chips, so it wasn't an extravagance to use the heat for these.They are very simple!One block of frozen puff pastry cut into twelve squares and then each rolled out to about three inches square - quite thin.  Some of the home made mincemeat left from Christmas was put in the middle of each square, about a dessertspoonful, and then the corners folded in to contain it all, and the whole parcel turned over so that all the gatherings are underneath.  I cut two small slits in the top of each one, brushed each with egg, and then sprinkled some brown sugar over as well, and baked at 160C in the fan oven for about 25 minutes.  The FH is in love again, and it isn't with me - he has eaten three tonight already!  Some of them split open a little but I shall know better for next time - for an experiment, I was quite pleased with the results.This is the beginning of the hatch last week - they weren't all out of the incubator yet.Very cute and fluffy.And this is the gang a week later - the fluff is already being superseded with the beginnings of the feathers, and they are looking more grown up!They are all well and healthy, and I am thrilled with the hatch."},
{"title": "My day \"off\"", "date": "Wednesday 11 May 2011", "text": "No meetings, no pick ups, no appointments, and I didn't have to be anywhere at any particular time - bliss!OK so I did have to go out and do a few errands around and about the village, but they were happily done in my own time, and I had time to stop and chat with people, rather than rushing.  So I have had a day at home, with the girls, pottering.  They were both in too much pain from the dental work yesterday to go to school today, so I have had to dose them up with Nurofen and let them sleep some of the day away in an attempt to get through the pain.  They were both up by lunchtime, and on softer foods for today, not that that has stopped them from eating!I had the lettuces and seedlings watered early this morning before the sun got out too strongly, did a couple of loads of washing and had those hung out in the sunshine, tidied the kitchen and the lounge, and did some weeding tonight.  I have also posted a dozen eggs to Somerset, so I hope they get there safe and sound, and, more to the point, I hope they hatch for the poor chap!I am a little disappointed as my cousin has had to postpone our lunch on Sunday - she was cooking for all of us and UJ for Sunday lunch, but her father-in-law, who lives with them, is ill so she has had to let me know we can't go this weekend.  Tis a shame, and I really hope he is feeling better soon.  She has just launched a new business, so she is stressed already, so I am praying that it is nothing too serious for him, and that he will make a speedy recovery.UJ was here for lunch with the FH today - he sat and snoozed much of the afternoon away but he did have half an hour in the garden with me later on, as we sat in the sun and chatted about the garden.  He will be coming to look after our little estate here whilst we go away for 4 nights in half-term, so we were talking about the chooks and who's who, and what is going on in the veg beds.  It was lovely to relax and chat.  He has an appointment on Thursday to see an orthopaedic surgeon about his hips and shoulder, where he is getting a lot of pain.  He had a hip replacement op in July of 1998, and now that hip is very painful again, and the other side is over-compensating and getting very sore as well, so he needs help.  I hope he can be put on the waiting list for surgery soon."},
{"title": "Ginger cake", "date": "Wednesday 11 May 2011", "text": "This is the only ginger cake recipe I have used in the last 12 years - there just hasn't been a need to look for another one when this works so well, and always brings compliments!I was a childminder when the EFG was small, and used to look after a child called B after school.  Her mum brought us a ginger cake one day, and everyone said how great it was [had lodgers at the time so there were several people to exclaim over how wonderful it was!] so I had to ask for the recipe.  The mum explained that this was B's Nanna's Ginger Cake, and so that is how I wrote it down in my old exercise book notebook, and that is how it has remained ever since!The recipe makes 2 or 3 cakes, in 2lb loaf tins.  I use loaf tin liners from Lakeland or Julian Graves, which I would recommend as it is a very runny mixture and would get between cut corners of a loaf tin if I lined it myself with greaseproof paper.Here we go:  Preheat an electric fan oven to 150C.  If you have another kind of oven, adjust accordingly.        2 tins         3 tins                       12 oz         15 oz         Golden syrup             8 oz         10 oz         Margerine or butter              Melt these two together in a pan over the heat                                 1lb         1 ¼ lb         Self raising flour             2 tsp         2 ½ tsp         Salt             4 tsp         5 tsp         Ground ginger             2 tsp         2 ½ tsp         Bicarbonate of soda             1 tsp         1 ½ tsp         Ground mixed spice             6 oz         7 ½ oz         Caster sugar              Sieve all the dry stuff together in a big bowl                                 2         3         eggs             2         2 ½          Cups milk (I use an American cup measure)              Beat eggs and milk together in a jug.                         So at this point you have cooling syrup and butter in a pan, dry ingredients in a big bowl, and the beaten eggs and milk mixture in a jug.  The two or three loaf pans should be ready to go, and the oven is on!Now you need some kind of beater - I use a small hand held electric mixer, but a big mixer would work well too.  You need to mix all the ingredients together in the big bowl, and mix, and mix.  It incorporates air, which makes it quite light, but it also needs to make sure that there are no lumps of flour clumping together.  So beat very well, and look for clumps.Pour into the tins and bake in the middle of the oven for anything from 40 minutes to about an hour depending on your oven.  I turn them around half way through as one side of my oven has a tendency to burn things.  It doesn't matter if it gets a little darkened, but you are looking to remove them from the oven as soon as a skewer/knife/toothpick [depending on where you are in the world!] comes out clean.  Leave them in the tins to cool, and then you have some options.You can start eating them!  Or you can pop one or two into large freezer bags and freeze them as they hold up well in the freezer.  Apart from that, if you can bear to wait, you will be rewarded: wrap in tinfoil and put in an airtight tin for up to a week or even a bit longer, and they will start to develop the \"stickiness\" of a bought Jamaica ginger cake which people seem to love.If you are making this as a gift, or for a coffee morning, for example, try to plan ahead and make it a few days in advance as it will definitely improve for keeping a few days.If you have dietary restrictions, note that this also works very well with soya milk, vegan margerine like Vitalite and barley flour.  When I could still have soya milk [soya products now give me bad stomach pains] I used to enjoy this cake too.  I haven't made it recently for myself, and I haven't tried it with the Dove's Farm gluten free flour, but the barley flour works fine for wheat-free people.Enjoy - and let us know if you try it out!"},
{"title": "Stop the world, I want to get off!", "date": "Tuesday 10 May 2011", "text": "I guess that I left blogland for nearly a week, because there just wasn't the time and energy to be here, as well as doing everything in real life that needed doing.  I have been reading your blogs, so I know that Sue at The Quince Tree has an immaculate fridge, and I have serious fridge-envy; Ilona is off to Scotland tomorrow, and I wish I was going too!  Then Albedo and the BH have planted some raspberries, and it sounds like Silversewer is off on a jolly as well........hope everyone is well.So, what's been happening here, then?The dust had barely settled on the new Headteacher appointment when we were thrown straight in to organising the official opening of the new extension of the school - they've been using it for a year, but we hadn't got round to having the bods and dignitaries out to cut the ribbon or open the curtain over the plaque - and now we have only just over a week to get it all sorted.  A lot of the background work has been done and now it is just the detail - and one huge thing no one told me about is that I have to make a speech - aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!  I've got just that week to think about that.The garden has taken off and I have seedlings coming up beautifully in the verandah.  Sunday afternoon I had to do some repotting, and they are all looking very healthy.  There's just the matter of the weeds in the raised beds to deal with before I can plant them out in a day or so.  I did manage to get 20 lettuce plants out, which I bought as plug plants and then potted up.  They seem to be doing very well, but I am watering them every day in this \"drought\" that we are having in the East.The chicks are going great guns - tiny feathers are now appearing amongst all the fluff and they are so cute.  Rather smelly, in my lounge, necessitating the use of lots of fragrant candles and having to be cleaned out daily, but cute nonetheless.  They may be moving shortly, as the next hatch is due tomorrow.  I bought some chocolate orpington bantam eggs from good old ebay, so fingers crossed that they do hatch.  I have had a message from someone else who bought partridge orpington eggs from the same seller as I did, with the disappointing nil points hatch.  He also had absolutely no fertile eggs in the 6 he bought, so we have done a deal and I am going to send him some of my eggs.  I had hoped to swap some, but he hasn't a cockerel, so that put paid to that idea.  If we get the payment sorted, I am hoping to get those in the post to him tomorrow.The girls have both been to the dentist today - the EFG to the local one for a filling with the FH as her chaperone, and I had to take the YFG to Cambridge to the orthodontist for tightening and alterations to her braces - and now she is in a lot of pain, as she is each time she has them altered.  I suspect I may be up a couple of times in the night, once for Nurofen and once for Calpol administration.   She has been to gym with me tonight, and worked hard, but I could see that she was in pain.I went to a nearby chapel out of the village on Sunday evening to a service which my mentor Local Preacher was taking and I was priviliged to meet an old gentleman called Fred who will be 98 on Thursday - he was lovely!  He said he hoped to make it to 100, but he wasn't confident.  I pray he does, and that I can meet him again.On Friday I made some ginger cakes: three - one for chapel craft meeting in the morning, one for the staffroom to say thanks to the staff for all their efforts over the HT work, and one for a member of staff and his wife, as his wife is quite ill.  They were all well received but the FH was miffed that there wasn't one left for home so I set to and made three more yesterday morning. I think that I will share the recipe with you tomorrow - although I may already have done so, way back in here somewhere - it will bear repeating as it is a fab cake and always brings me compliments!Good night :-)"},

We successfully appointed a new Head last night so that is a big relief - although I am mentally exhausted after the whole process!The chick count is now up to 12, although the photos are still on the phone.  And the YFG had her first piano lesson with a proper piano teacher tonight, and she did really well and liked the lady, which is a bonus.  That's all I can say tonight as all I want to do is fall into the bath and head for bed.  Hopefully I will be able to fill in the gaps at the weekend!"},

{"title": "Maggie's Monday", "date": "Monday 2 May 2011", "text": "Apparently, Margaret Thatcher once said that the most satisfying day was one on which one had everything to do, and one got it all done, or words to that effect.  So today has been like that - I feel like I have got tonnes done!  I cut the back lawn, watered all the veg seedlings and the gooseberry plants, made 6 loaves of bread and some sticky buns, did some ironing, looked after the chooks, had time to sit in the sun for half an hour and read a book, and have watched some tv tonight - another new drama called \"Case Sensitive\" which concludes tomorrow evening.Now I am off to have a bath before going to bed - very early start in the morning as I need to be at school just after 8am for the first day of the HT selection procedure - I just hope I have all the paperwork in hand.  Hoping to see some cracks in the eggs by the morning as well - keep your fingers crossed!"},
{"title": "Special Sunday", "date": "Sunday 1 May 2011", "text": "We didn't arise too early this morning, as it being the first Sunday of the month, I was taking the 11am service at chapel, and I didn't feel up to going to the 9.30am service as well.  We missed a treat, as it happened, as the preacher at the 9.30am was a retired baker and confectioner and he brought along cream meringues and chocolate eclairs!!  My service went OK, although I could still do with more of a congregation....The spare washing machine has been hard at it all afternoon but it has been so windy here today that the washing has dried in no time.  I must have had five or six loads through it today, so what with the sun and the wind, the washing smells lovely - so fresh and clean - just as clean washing should smell.  We have enjoyed watching the new mystery drama, \"Vera\" tonight, starring Brenda Blethyn, and she is excellent.  It was a rather gritty drama, and I really enjoyed watching it, although the YFG was fiddling with my feet half the time, and tickling me!!  She has been working really hard today on her science revision, as has the EFG, so they both deserved a rest.  And William and Kate are not swanning off on honeymoon immediately, but enjoying a secluded weekend break in the UK before returning to Anglesey next week so that the Prince can return to work - I am impressed.  That fits in so well with the dignified and not-over-the-top tone of the whole wedding; somehow two weeks somewhere hot and expensive would have spoiled that.  Good for them.  I must admit to being shocked at reading in the paper today that Pippa Middleton's dress would have cost around £20,000. That seems to be an obscene amount of money to pay for a piece of material, however expertly draped.  I must remember to tell my girls not to fall in love with a prince, as there is no way I could afford it!We are hoping for a hatch from the big blue incubator this week.  In order to keep the bought in GPO eggs separate from my own ones, we have removed the bought in ones to another incubator so that when they hatch, we will know which birds are which.  I am hoping for some good news by Wednesday!  Will keep you up to date on that.  I will have to get the FH to buy some chick crumbs on Tuesday afternoon when he takes the girls to gymnastics, and get the lights sorted out.The EFG has sold a few books on eBay this weekend, so I must help her to sort them out and package them up to post on Tuesday.  She's quite pleased to have some money in her camera fund already!"},
{"title": "Ups and downs", "date": "Saturday 30 April 2011", "text": "I had to send the girls on their bikes down to the shop this morning to fetch me a newspaper for the photos from the wedding yesterday - and the papers didn't disappoint me: glorious full colour spreads of the balcony kiss, the wedding processions, the fashions, the mothers, etc - although the official photos aren't out yet.  Perhaps tomorrow!  That was one of the ups of the day.The biggest down is that the washing machine has conked out, and so the FH has had to plumb a spare one that a neighbour gave us into the workshop.  It is an old one, and I am not sure how reliable it is going to be, but if it lets me get the school uniforms washed tomorrow, I will be happy! The white wash sat in the broken machine for nearly two days, sopping wet, before we could manage to get the door open, and now it won't do a thing, except flash an orange light at us most forlornly.  I successfully made five banana and chocolate cakes today to use up the bananas which are still attracting fruit flies like the plague.  I won't be buying any more for a while.  One of the cakes can go to chapel for the refreshments in the morning, one can stay here to be eaten and the others will be stashed in the freezer.  An investment in the future!The girls have both been revising today for exams, both working hard - I am very proud of them both for the way they work hard and take their studying seriously.  I'm still feeling stressed, and my stomach is still a little upset, so I am trying to relax.  I have finished all the paperwork for the selection process, and it is put away.  I have got out a couple of Katie Fforde books to lose myself in tonight and tomorrow afternoon - they are very relaxing!  Hope you are all having a lovely weekend."},
{"title": "What a day!", "date": "Friday 29 April 2011", "text": "One of the kisses on the balconyIt was a lovely wedding - I can't get over how beautiful Catherine looked, the gorgeous dress, and all the pageantry and pomp were just wonderful.  This is Britain at its best, surely.  The crowds in London were loving it all, and we had the best views on the tv at home, from the comfort of our armchairs.  Catherine is not over the top; she strikes me as very dignified, demure and reserved, so she should fit in well with the Royal Family.  I thought her dress had echoes of the Queen's dress from 1947 with all that lace - very elegant.These occasions always make me want to go and dig out a Royal Family tree so that I can work out who everyone is and how they are all related.  I'm sure that Princess Alexandra is probably the oldest royal princess nowadays, and I think I heard someone say something today (one of the commentators) about the Queen being pleased now that her eldest grandson is married, but I thought that her eldest grandson was the Princess Royal's son, Peter Philips, who married the Canadian Autumn Kelly a while back........these are the sorts of things I think of and have to go and Google to satisfy my curiosity!This afternoon I have been sorting out the 11am service on Sunday - the secondary readings for the day are all about the Temple, so I have constructed a service about the Temple and how God dwells in us now, according to the reading from Corinthians which is part of the service.  I am going to email it all over to a mentor friend tonight and get the go-ahead on it all........"},

I will be emailing some of my colleagues tomorrow and hope to get it sorted out quickly.  SFT - I didn't manage to snap any photos of our royal wedding, although the local papers were there, so I am hoping that they took some good ones.

There will be corsages for the ladies, and buttonholes for the gentlemen too.  They are all quite excited at doing something different and having fun!  My only disappointment is that I won't be at home to see the FH go out in all his finery, but I should be able to get a photo when he comes home, as I will be back by then."},
{"title": "A different kind of day", "date": "Tuesday 26 April 2011", "text": "After the two weeks of holidays, it was back to reality with a bang this morning: straight into the school at 9.30am to talk to the staff about the headteacher selection days next week, pop into the chapel for a meeting about Knit & Natter, a new project the steward would like to get off the ground, and then home to gather the troops and off to Dad's for lunch.Lunch was lovely - the gang all had fish and chips in \"pensioners' portions\" from the local chippy, and then MB had made rhubarb and strawberry crumble, which she served with ice cream, and one of her neighbours had also given her a beautiful plum pie which he had made himself - he is a widower of about 87 years of age, and the FH said it was really excellent pastry, and all home made.  We sat around chatting for some time after the meal, and the girls were giving Grandad some pointers on his camera and mobile phone, whilst we had a cup of tea.  We had to leave by 3pm in order to be home in time to turn the incubating eggs, but we had had a lovely time, and the YFG came home with two little sunflower seedlings - they are from sunflowers MB grew last year, and they reached well over 9 feet tall, so we are hoping for some whoppers here this year.Talking of seedlings - the kale is through - the little seedlings were there this morning when I undid the plastic greenhouse to have a peep at them all.  I can't believe how quickly they have grown, considering that I only sowed the seeds on Friday!This evening the FH has been out on a wild goose chase!  A friend in the village called him up to get some help with a swarm of bees in one of her outbuildings, but when he got there, the swarm was old and had been there for quite some time, and was so well ensconced in the crack in the building that he felt it would be impossible to get them out, and he has unfortunately had to recommend that the pest control be called to remove them - an absolute last resort, but he felt that there may be some disease in the \"hive\" because of the state of the comb that he could see.Tonight I have been helping the EFG to list a load of books on eBay - she wants to clear some space in her bedroom, and she also would like some money to buy a camera; she has found the one she would like on the Amazon website so she knows she has to raise about £65.  The sales of the books might help to begin with, and then we are going to sell some Playmobil as well, which may turn out to be a little more lucrative.  We'll probably try to get that listed before the weekend, as I am sure that people who browse eBay might have some time this coming long weekend.I have also had a little clearout - a big heap of magazines has been bagged up in fours and fives for the FH to take to the lunch club tomorrow for the ladies to take home to browse and swap amongst themselves.  I have kept the Slimming World magazines, as I really need to use those!!Anyway - better get off to bed!  Good night!"},

I have a big and painful blister in the palm of my hand for my trouble, but 45 strawberry plants are now in the fresh, weed-free bed, well watered in and looking promising!  More weeding on the agenda before that bed is clear, though...(small sigh!)The girls have melted down some of their many Easter eggs, and used the chocolate to coat Rice Krispies and hey presto - chocolate covered Rice Krispie cakes - a blast from the past as I don't think they have made those for years - and there was exercise involved: a 2mile bike ride to the shop to buy the cereal.We are off to my dad's tomorrow for lunch, so we have to get organised as tomorrow looks complicated already!  9am I have to go to a staff meeting at school, then to Knit & Natter at church for a while.  After that, we can nip off to the lunch date.  Hairdressing is timetabled for our return at about 4pm, just in time to turn the chocolate orpington eggs in the little incubator!  The YFG needs a trim before she goes back to school, so B is nipping up to do that for us tomorrow afternoon.  The evening will be spent sorting out clothes for school and packing their bags ready for the off at 8am on Wednesday morning - these early starts are going to be painful until we all get used to them again."},

We started off in the local town, where we tried Stead & Simpson, Clarks, a discount outlet, and Tesco.  Assorted other shops hampered our speed and we just had to pop in here and there to acquire other trifles like the weekly newspaper, and some chicken food.  Then we gave up and travelled to the speciality shop in Downham Market - Smith's Shoes - where the wonderful lady found two pairs in the right size, only one of which actually fit, but the YFG also liked them, a bit.The YFG was flagging, and had to be pepped up with a lolly, but all this shoe-trying-on is hard work on a girl, don't you know!!

Three kinds of tomatoes, some peppers, kale, pumpkins, courgettes, leeks, chives and onions, rosemary and plenty of beans - runner beans and dwarf French beans, as well as climbing French beans - we love beans!  They are in the greenhouse, and in the mini greenhouse in the verandah.  Now I have to do some weeding to keep the beds ready to plant them out when they are ready in a week or three.The EFG has made whoopie pies today with her friend, and they are mostly eaten!  Now that she has made them a couple of times, I have two bowls of the marshmallow filling in the fridge - why she keeps making more I don't know, but I must find something else to use it up on.We have had fish for supper today, in the Good Friday tradition - the folks had fish pie and I had some Value white fish with home made oven chips.  The YFG has had a very lazy day: she started off helping me in the garden and quickly got fed up with that plan and retreated to the coolness of the lounge - it has been hot again today - and she watched several films - a good Disney version of Moses, and then The Princess Diaries 2.  Yesterday wore her out completely, and she has had a day to recover today - she'll be back at it tomorrow.Tomorrow there's lots on, so I'll pop in now and again to check the blogs.  Happy Easter!"},

We arrived at the cinema a good 15 minutes after the scheduled start of the film, and the foyer was empty.  I asked one of the girls on the food concessions if I could still get tickets, and she said,\"Yes,\" and sold me some.  We crept into the cinema where \"Red Riding Hood\" was on, and slipped into seats at the front of the tiered seating.  We were quiet, and it was very dark as the film had just begun.  When a white screen came up and gave off a lot of light when the story line demanded snow, I turned to look at the rest of the auditorium - and we were completely alone!  They were running the film just for us....I called in at the local vegetable plant nursery on the way home and picked up 5 tumbling tomato plants, a few lettuce plants and two pepper plants, to get us off to a start whilst our own seeds come through.  I pottered in the garden for an hour or so and the EFG went off to see her friend, and then later we watched a film together (yes, another one!!) and had a break!  It was a lazy kind of day and one we enjoyed together.The YFG and FH arrived home at about 7.30pm and the YFG was shattered after a busy day playing in the park.  We have had jacket potatoes, mince mixture, carrots and cauliflower for supper, and we are off to bed now.  Good Friday will be here soon - another Bank Holiday - but no church services in our church tomorrow, unfortunately, but I may read one to myself anyway.  Sunday morning in church will be very joyful, and I always feel that Easter isn't quite right if you don't mark His death on GF first.  Easter is as big a Christian festival as Christmas, but somehow it has been turned into a \"Bank Holiday weekend\" for everyone,  and some folk don't understand what it is all about at all.......Enough wittering - I'm off to bed with a book!  Night, all."},

I am feeling more rested as the days go on, and today we have done less in the garden and a little more in the house instead.  I did think about going outside, but it was just too hot.....and it is only April.  The verandah doors all had to be flung open, and we have had to think about putting some shade up in there of some kind as the freezers are working overtime in the heat.  The YFG went out at 3.30pm to her friend's house for a sleepover, so we have a quiet night tonight!  She and the friend will be back early in the morning as they are off to Wicksteed Park with the FH tomorrow - they are so excited!  I am probably going to take the EFG to the cinema for her treat.I'm off now - heaps of ironing to do after all the washing I got dry yesterday!!"},
{"title": "Steamer savings", "date": "Tuesday 19 April 2011", "text": "On Saturday, I piled all our ingredients for our evening meal into these pots and pans so that I could cook everything on the heat of just one gas ring!Broccoli florets in the top steamer.Carrots and potatoes closest to the heat in the lower steamer.And a joint of boiling bacon in the pan at the bottom, cooking away at a simmer.I mentioned to the FH that if only I had had another steamer pan, I could have put a rolypoly pudding on the top - he urged me to go and get another one so that he wouldn't miss out next time!!  I admit that we do like these joints and sometimes we have them with roast potatoes, but that involves the oven, and I am trying to cut back our electricity usage so this kind of cooking arrangement goes a long way towards that goal.And the pans - the big one at the bottom is a very good quality one from John Lewis which I have had for 11 years - the only thing is that it used to be black and the coating wore off  the outside!  The top steamer is stainless steel and comes from the same purchase as the pan, but the middle steamer is about the same age as me, if not older, as it was my mum's, and is still going strong.  I use a steamer almost every day, so they are worth while having.Here are a few of the new girls.  They are about 13 weeks old, quite skinny and very timid, but they are getting used to fresh air now!Here is their front door - normally we would just open the pophole but they are nervous about using it at the moment, so we are opening the whole section whilst the weather is good, and they can get used to coming and going.Their legs look lanky!!  They are lovely birds and I am very pleased with them.I was a trifle disappointed today with the whole electricity saga - there I was, expecting a good six hours of technology-free time! The power went off at about 8.45am, just as the YFG was leaving for her day out, but later on, about an hour and a half later on, when the EFG, FH and I were enjoying a cup of tea, made with water from the flask I prepared earlier, there was a loud beep and we heard the answerphone come on, signalling clearly that power was restored.I was dubious that that was that, and thought that since the power company had warned us it would be off for 6 hours, it might just be a temporary reconnection.  But it wasn't.  Power cut over.I did enjoy the absolute silence for a while this morning - the kitchen was so quiet - no fridges humming away in the background, no kettle boiling, no toaster popping etc.  And in the garden, one neighbour got his petrol mower out and did the lawn pretty early, which resulted in a lovely fresh-mown grass fragrance.  The overabundance of fruit flies in this area has been on the news tonight, and, boy, do we know what they mean!!  There are millions of them, repopulating areas as fast as they are dying from the flyspray - and now my utility room looks like a fly graveyard and is going to need some heavy duty cleaning to get rid of all the tiny bodies.  I want some of those hanging flypapers but I am not sure where to get any from, so I have asked UJ to check out a very traditional ironmonger's shop near where he lives as I think that if they are available, they will have them!The FH and I spent some time in the garden this morning, before it got too hot.  We were filling tubs with soil and then planting potatoes - I think we have 9 tubs of them now.  We also filled some of the tomato troughs up with fresh soil, although there are more to do which need weeding before we can top them up.  We still didn't get any seeds planted today - there's always tomorrow!"},

I'm quite looking forward to it!!  No phone, no computer, no tv, no washing machine, no iron!  So it also means no kettle, but we can fill a flask before the power goes off, we are going to boost the freezers to the max setting tonight and then leave them unopened tomorrow, and we have a gas hob so we can still cook if we want to.The YFG is going out with some friends to the coast tomorrow, so it won't really affect her, and I anticipate a day in the garden, and some studying.  I'm not planning on going anywhere, and the peace will be novel.The incubator has been taken to a friend's house tonight, and will be retrieved when the power is back on later tomorrow.Yesterday's gymnastics competition went well, on the whole.  We took a rather different complement of gymnasts from the year before and the results reflect that.  Some of the older girls who competed in this one last year have moved up a level and will be competing at a comp in June.  That meant that the girls and boy in the comp yesterday were younger on average, and less experienced.  A couple of our gymnasts weren't able to attend because of the late notice of the date, and that also had a minor impact on the results.  However, the gymnasts brought home 7 Gold medals, 9 Silver and 2 Bronze, so we are still very proud of them.  A number of them also managed some very creditable 4th/5th/6th positions in large fields, so they are also winners!The gym is on holiday now until the first Tuesday in May, so we have a couple of weeks to think about some new lesson plans and ideas for what we want to achieve with the gymnasts next term.  I have spent today mooching around and doing very little as I feel so tired after yesterday - like I am just getting over the flu, that kind of tiredness - and I wasn't up early this morning.  The EFG has made some Whoopie Pies this afternoon, and we babysat some friends this afternoon whilst their mum was busy for an hour.  They brought \"The Sword in the Stone\" DVD along, which stimulated some interested discussions between us about the many variations on the Arthurian legend - including the \"Merlin\" tv programme which is currently being repeated on CBBC in advance of the new season starting soon.  I have a book called \"The Road to Avalon\" by Joan Wolf, I think, which I love, whether it is an accurate reflection on the legend or not.  I even gave the EFG a middle name from the book!  The winner of the Allotment Notebook, picked at random from lots of little folded pieces of paper by the YFG this morning is..........drum roll, please.....................Silversewer!Thank you to everyone else who was kind enough to comment.  Silversewer, please send me your address as a comment, which I won't publish.  And Albedo, for the Home Farmer magazine, please could I have your address as well please so I can get them both in the post this week."},

The only more frugal thing I could do would be to let the grey show, and I'm not quite ready for that yet - although they do show for a while in between colourings!Edit - it's dry now and it is a little darker than I thought it would be, but the greys are gone for now!"},
{"title": "Using it all up from the stockcupboards", "date": "Wednesday 13 April 2011", "text": "Inspired by Frugal Queen, we are trying to eat up some of our stores to save some money towards the laptop expense.  Above here are some fruit loaves and dough buns which I made from an Big Brands For Less big bag of mixture.  The dough buns rose, were baked and then iced so we ended up with home made iced buns, just like you can buy in the shop but for a fraction of the cost.  The fruit loaves came from the same mixture but with the addition of mixed fruit and a teaspoon of spices.Today the FH and UJ went out to their lunch club, so the girls and I ate our main meal at lunchtime too, since they are on school holidays - chicken and broccoli from the freezer, coleslaw from the fridge, and Smash-type instant potato which was a little left in the bottom of an old tub and really needed using up!! This was the chicken - I made a sauce from a little golden syrup and some ketchup, garlic and finely diced red pepper - and it was delicious.Earlier in the week - another chicken concoction - home made stew!And using up those black bananas - a firm family favourite.  One to eat and one to freeze.Tonight I watched \"Superscrimpers\" on C4, I think - what a revelation.  Some of the army of older ladies have some fab ideas for moneysaving, and then there was the young mum, Sarita, who was spending over £300/month on clothes, mostly for herself, although she said some were for her young children.  That is a lot of money to be spending on clothes on a monthly basis - and she was doing it on the internet, and a lot of the clothes were stashed in a wardrobe, unworn.  A monthly gas bill of £96 was also swiftly addressed!  I'm so lucky to have found all the blogs I know of, and I am sure that there are so many more, which can teach me so much about spending wisely and saving for what we need.This is our big automatic electric incubator - an Italian Corti model. The turning motor is attached in this block on the side with an additional power supply.  The turning motor is an addition, as it is possible to buy it without the turning mechanism - cheaper but more work.  It means that if you use the mechanism, two sockets are needed. This is it, empty.   There is a water reservoir at each end, and that light blue toggle is the internal thing on which the rack sits which makes the rack move backwards and forwards to turn the eggs.  It is very easily cleaned with some Flash.Here is the plastic tray on which the eggs actually sit.These dividers ensure that the eggs stay in one place and just rotate on the longest axis.This is it, loaded up last night with the Cornish eggs at the front of the picture and my eggs behind.We'd quite like to go back to Thetford Forest for another long walk through the woods - that is a lovely day out!  Really depends on the housework and gardening and the weather!Planning to make more use of the Remoska and use the big oven less.  Very keen to make another trip to Ely Cathedral - we love it and haven't been for a couple of years now.  The FH isn't up to the walking but he would happily sit down by the river and watch the world go by....Some of these arrived from Cornwall, well packaged, so they went in to the incubator last night with some of our own eggs - fully loaded now with 25 eggs.And the hens are laying well now, so we are planning to get the older polystyrene box incubators out and hatch a few more of our own eggs - we are figuring that two hatches close together may be easier to manage than spreading them through out the season as we did last year....and I have my eye on some bantam Chocolate Orpington eggs on ebay - they are going \"Cheep!\" if you can pardon the pun - auction finishes at 8pm tonight so will I bid or won't I?!?Edited to add - I bid - but will I win??Back again - I won!  Six bantam Chocolate Orpington eggs for just £1.04 and postage."},

{"title": "End of term relief!", "date": "Saturday 9 April 2011", "text": "Yes, I finally feel like we have made it to the end of a long term!  Gymnastics classes are all finished now until after the Royal Wedding, and so we have almost three weeks of school holidays, apart from a pesky two days where the kids have to go to school on the Wednesday and Thursday between Easter and the Wedding - hardly worth the effort, but I know that there is a legal minimum number of days that the children have to be in school so they have to fit them all in somewhere!I managed an extra hour in bed this morning, and then ended up doing the headless chicken dance, trying to get it all done before we had to go out.  I got to the shed to let the chooks out and found one a bit sorry for herself - her legs are not working terribly well and she was being trodden on by the others - chooks don't do sympathy or empathy at all.  I separated her and gave her some food and water; by the time I got home again at 3pm she was able to walk if she had to, but she preferred not to, so she had made a little progress towards recovery.  She is in a box with some straw in the shed, apart from her mates, tonight, and we will assess her tomorrow.  Hopefully she will be looking better.Gym was busy this morning with 30 children and lots to do as it was the last training session before a lot of them have a competition next Sunday.   We came back to the village and dropped another child off and then stopped to have a chat with his parents for a while, enjoying a nice cold drink in their garden.Later I took the YFG and went off to Huntingdon - I bought the laptop I want to save up for!  I know that sounds rather backwards, but I just took the money out of savings and committed to replacing it by the end of the month, which I know I can do.  We needed some new crockery and I wanted to buy a set I had seen in our local Tesco but when I went to buy it last night, they were out of stock, so I rang round and found out that  the big store had 15 sets in stock.  I was rather mystified as I thought wherever you bought something from a Tesco, it would be the same price - but not so - it was £20 in our local store, £19 in another, and when I bought it today, it was only £18.  I know that isn't a huge difference, but it is nevertheless a difference.  And so this doesn't fit with having a super-frugal month, does it?  No, it doesn't but sometimes you just have to do these things - the crockery has chooks on it and I just loved it!!  It hasn't broken the bank....On the way home from Huntingdon, I called in to see my Dad and MB.  They have had someone out to sort them out with a Freeview box and new remote control, but they can't quite get the hang of it, so the YFG soon set-to and gave them a quick lesson.  It was nice to see them, and they would like us to go over in the holidays for lunch one day, so I must bear that in mind.And so tonight - the EFG and FH are laughing at Michael Macintyre on the tv and the YFG is setting up the new laptop which she and I will share.  It is red.  She is very pleased that it is red!My incubator is still sitting in the verandah covered in a thick layer of dust, but little Leah has gone broody, so the question now is what to do with the eggs I bought from Cornwall this week - put them in the incubator or trust them to Leah?  I think Leah might get a go - they arrived from Cornwall yesterday so I could sort Leah out with somewhere safe and cosy to sit and then put them under her tomorrow.....and I must get some other eggs in the incubator this week as otherwise time is ticking on and I am getting nowhere fast - nary a seed set this year yet either........"},
{"title": "Heading for another milestone", "date": "Thursday 7 April 2011", "text": "I am heading for my 700th post here, so I am thinking about a giveaway again.  Chances are it might be a cookbook, as I have lots and lots.......but then again, it might be something a bit more inspired - I'll think about it as I have 8 posts to go, I think. Today has been a gloriously sunny day like yesterday and it has been a joy to be outside, and to have washing on the line.  It all smells gorgeous.  We had a trip to the town this morning, the FH and I.  He wanted some screws and nails, and I needed to put a key through a friend's door and go to the Co-op, where I bought a lot of fresh fruit and veg and some reduced-price meat.  We haven't been out together like that for several weeks, so that was lovely.  The FH pottered in his shed for a while this afternoon whilst I was at school (again!) and prepared some veg for tea for me, as I had put a casserole in the oven before I went out.This evening, I took the girls back to school to watch the Drama club's production of The Crucible.  It wasn't bad, but me being so tired, I was ready to come home by the interval.  Since one of the EFG's friends was one of the main characters, we weren't allowed to leave by the EFG, so we stayed, but I am heading off to bed now.I love to check the stats page on the Dashboard of Blogger here on the blog - and it never ceases to amaze me that people are reading this!  But I have noticed that day in, day out, someone looks at the sausage plait recipe, back in the posts a couple of years, and that frequently the posts for courgette cakes are also looked at - why is that?  People find them through Google, it seems - so perhaps they are searching for specific recipes - interesting! Perhaps I should include more recipes and food ideas on here - what do you think?"},
{"title": "My Mum", "date": "Wednesday 6 April 2011", "text": "Mothering Sunday just having passed, my thoughts are now turning to tomorrow.  If she'd still been with us, it would have been Mum's 70th birthday tomorrow.  She died back in 1998, so my memories of her are as a 56 year old, but because of her illnesses, she was old before her time, and certainly died too young.  She knew the EFG, and loved her totally.  We lived in Scotland then, so she liked to travel up to see us quite often.  She came up with my dad the week before she died so we had fresh memories of a week spent with the EFG when she died.  The call came at lunchtime to tell me that she had collapsed and been taken into the hospital, but it took us until nearly 3pm to make the travel arrangements and get the responsibilities at home taken care of, so it was 11pm before we made it to the hospital.  She was unconscious, but I remember kissing her and telling her that I had brought the EFG to see her, and that I would bring the EFG back in the morning to the hospital.  We went home to my parents' house and went to bed.  The phone rang just after 1am to say that she had died.  She had been battling against cancer for several years; leiomyosarcoma, I believe her particular battle was called.  It started in her uterus, spread to her back, her head, and eventually she had lumps and bumps all over the place, even after enduring several long operations.And so she never met the YFG, didn't see us move back to England, missed out on all the big milestones in the girls' lives, missed out on her own life so much.  And we miss her terribly and still wonder occasionally what life would be like if she was still here.  But she lives on, particularly as I see her every day in the mirror as I am getting older! The EFG shows a lot of signs of being in the same mould as my mum and I.  My sister also has a lot of her traits, some we share and some are different but no one could doubt that we are her daughters.This is what the EFG did for me for Mothering Sunday at lunchtime when we came home from church - \"Mum's teaparty\" on the buns!There was tea as well, and a candle lit - and my huge \"Best Mum in the World\" mug too!It was a very special surprise for me."},

I have had to send a couple of emails, but I am off to get in the bath and head to bed now.  Night all!Good morning friends!  I am up very early as I have a babysitting favour to do for a friend this morning: she has to take her mother to hospital for 7am, so I am going to her house at 5.50am to look after her children and get them to school at 8.30am in case the traffic holds her up, and to save the children having to go out at this time of the morning.......I am just sitting here with a cup of tea, coming round!  Today is looking very fragmented already:babysitting job until 8.30am, home to let out the chooks and hang the washing, meeting at school at 10am, home for lunch, back to school for 1.30pm for a quick chat, home again probably, then the shortlisting for the HT job at 3.30pm for as long as it takes, then gymnastics till 8pm.  It is going to be a very in-and-out kind of day, and I will be ready for my bed by 9pm tonight, I am sure.I have packed the lunches for the girls and have to wake the EFG up just as I am going out the door to do something to her hair for her, then she will probably doze until 7am, when I will ring them to make sure they are both getting up.  They will be fine to get themselves out of the door by 8am then.Hope you all have a good day, and I will try to pop back later!"},

Thanks for asking.In the meantime, here is a link to information about mine, and I do believe I bought it from the company I have linked to.  I thought I bought it from Ascott Smallholding Supplies, but they don't stock it, and I remember having a large box delivered on its own, so it was probably this!!  I bought my lamps for brooding the chicks from Ascott, and leg rings, and a humidity gauge as well, so they are a mine of useful bits and pieces for chicken keepers."},

The church services went off well, and then we came home to find that the EFG had made cakes and prepared a tea party for me.  She took a photo for me of how she had arranged the table - it was just lovely!  I'll share the picture when she emails it to me.  Tea and cakes was actually lunch!In the afternoon, I pootled around a little; the YFG and I cut the front lawn, I looked at the chooks, my dad and MB came over and had a cup of tea with us and told us about their last holiday.  I saw the end of Nigel Slater's programme, missed Guy and his boat completely, watched some of Countryfile, ate our tea and then I had a snooze!  We've got the girls off to bed, watched Lewis on ITV + 1, and so here I am, just turning things off and putting the ironing away on my way to bed!  I've had a few moments to think about my own mother, and the YFG was asking what life would be like if she was still here.  Quite different, probably!  I lit a candle for her today, and one for Merry.Here I am again - having a first cup of tea, reading some blogs, checking some emails, reading through the service I am delivering at 11am, and enjoying the peace and quiet!!We are having, from today, additional monthly services, just on that first Sunday of the month, at 11am.  The existing 9.30am service will be led by the preacher on the plan, and then people who can't be there at 9.30am can come along at 11am and they will have to make do with me.  I have put together a service [my tenth - I have just counted them up in the book] which is more for adults than children, but if any children turn up, there are bits in it that can be adapted, but for which I shall have to rely upon the YFG to help me!  We are going to the 9.30am service first ourselves, and then we shall have to get things sorted out for the second service....the FH has to go and fetch one older lady who would like to attend but needs transport.  Even if we start small today, I hope it will grow throughout the year.If you are reading this early, think of me at 11am and wonder as I am doing now, whether I will be facing a congregation of 3 (older lady, FH and YFG) or more!!"},

Their fifth child, a boy, was born last year on the 2nd April, so today would have been his first birthday.  And therein lies the pain - Freddie lived for only 11 days.

I know Merry and her daughters from when we used to home educate, and although I haven't seen them much over the past five years or so, I do follow Merry's blog and have enjoyed watching her daughters grow up through the window that the internet affords us.  We all send them much love today and always."},

I haven't had a chance to think about spring cleaning, or Easter much either [although I do have that 58p leg of lamb at the ready!] so it's time thoughts turned homeward.Home.  Where one of my dear relatives should have been yesterday and wasn't, and then my two girls were left wondering where everyone was when they got home.  UJ was going to come here to lunch with the FH at the lunch club, as he does every week, but then he was going to have to nip off to meet my dad and MB off the coach from their latest holiday.  He would need to take my dad's car as they had 4 suitcases, and he has a Vauxhall Corsa and wouldn't fit it all in.  So the FH and I were mystified when he arrived here at 11am in his own car - then he said that dad's wouldn't start!  When they went to lunch, the plan was that the FH would go to do the taxi trip in the Volvo, and UJ would stay here........I went off to school for meetings at 1pm and 3.30pm, came home at 4.45pm and there was no one here!  No children, no UJ.  My lightbulb went on in my brain and I started to wonder where the girls were.....they were at a friend's house around the corner, thank goodness, after they had tried to get in over the back gate.  They had managed it, and got their key in the back door but then been frustrated to find that I had left the other key on the inside!  They were remarkably forgiving, but I felt rather angry that the menfolk hadn't followed the plan, and the FH had taken UJ along for the ride!Last night, the EFG was at Brownies/Guides where she volunteers and the FH and UJ went to the History Society talk in the village, about a local Roman excavation, which was interesting.  I took the chapel Steward to the Circuit meeting, and so the YFG went next door to our lovely neighbours and had a great time, playing with them on the XBOX and eating pancakes!  She probably had the best evening of the lot of us!And so to today.......I'm really looking forward to Easter and the school being closed for a couple of weeks - I am looking forward to sleeping in a few times, to cleaning the house properly and doing things with the girls!  I'm tired now.  Hugs to everyone, and take care of yourselves."},

Mine were the only BS in the auction, and they didn't make terribly good prices - I think that is because they are such a rare breed that people don't know about them.  They are lovely birds, decent layers and quite docile.  I love them!And here are three more of them.  They love to perch on this ladder-type construction in their pen.  When you get one on each \"rung\" they look funny, but the one at the bottom had just jumped off her perch and mucked up that shot!One of my two Barred Plymouth Rock pullets.  I don't particularly like this breed as I find them a little bit boisterous but they are a means to an end - I need them for the Brussbar breeding programme, so I have to have them.  I need to keep them for a year, so I might just breed them straight this year, and have a few to sell later.And this is the pullets' unrelated husband.  He and his family are about 2 weeks older than the girls, but he is the only one left.  I took a chance on him and put his brothers in the pot, as one of them had a habit of going for the back of my legs as I walked away from them.  This is the best-natured of the three of the cockerels so he got the reprieve!The pen of mixed layers.  There's Goldenburg in the midst of the Light Sussex!  She is four years old now and still going strong.  The LS are a mixture of five older hens and all the pullets that their eggs produced last September.  The cockerels are gone as all I want from these are eggs to eat.Some of the seeds I want to get sown this week - courgettes, tomatoes, peppers, kale, and cucumbers.The FH has put these Kestrel potatoes to chit in the verandah....I thought that they had to be somewhere dark, but they seem to be working.  He has some huge black pots to put them in, so they will be going in soon too.Blossom on the plum tree - has yet to produce a plum, and there is a noticeable absence of small creatures to pollinate it, so I doubt that there will be any plums this year either.  It does look gorgeous though!  Excuse the overgrown lavender in the background.And the apple trees are just coming into leaf - they do it the other way around with the leaves coming first and the blossom later.Showing you all my hard work with the fork, digging this lot over.  Three beds done and three to do - that one top middle is where the strawberry plants are and it is in dire need of weeding before they start to grow....they have already started to grow!! I need to get on with that."},
{"title": "Get fresh - and real!", "date": "Monday 28 March 2011", "text": "Two things made me stop and think this weekend. The first was on Saturday when I was reading the paper - we buy a paper on the weekend for the tv listings - and I came across an article about \"just how fresh is fresh food at the supermarket?\" - short answer appears not to be very fresh at all.  Apparently, eggs could be almost a month old, bread 10 days since it was baked, apples 6 months since they were on the tree.  There are two sides to this - I do understand that it is perfectly possible to store apples (my granny used to keep them in boxes in the coal shed, each one painstakingly wrapped in paper) and we used to eat them, knowing that they were every so slightly wrinkly and soft because that is how they go when they have been stored like that.  But expectations of the masses are rising, and it is no longer acceptable for an apple to be wrinkly  - now it has to look as if it plopped off the tree this morning, fresh and firm, and so today's markets provide us with an apple which has been in cold storage for months to keep it looking \"right\".Bread - well, there is a world of difference between the loaves that my grandfather rose hours before dawn to bake in his bakery so that the village could have fresh bread on a daily basis and what is marketed as fresh bread today.  It is no longer baked in the villages, but in supermarkets and shops where it might actually not be made from scratch but just part-baked to finish it off.  And so it has to travel further....and so it can't get here that fast, so it has to have preservatives and junk added to keep it longer so that it still tastes \"good\" when it finally arrives at the shop, up to two days after it was made, and then sits on the shelf for a couple of days, before being brought home to sit in a bread bin for a day or two.  SO different from home made bread, often made and eaten the same day, or at least made yesterday and frozen this morning.It appears that legally, eggs can be up to 10 days old before they even get to the supermarket, so how they call those \"fresh\" I don't know.  When I tell someone that my eggs are fresh, that usually means laid that day or the day before.  We have on occasions had to go and raid the henhouses to get eggs for a neighbour and that means that the eggs they used for their omelette were only hours old.  That's fresh!I'm not even going to go into fresh fruit and veg, flown half way around the world in some cases, or washed in loads of chemicals and put in bags in other examples.  Plot to plate in 10 yards is the best we can do here and even when we get things from UJ, it has come less than 20 miles, and has usually been picked the night before.  And fruit juice - the mind boggles - frozen, concentrated, reconstituted, the variations are endless.  Can we no longer squeeze an orange?! Or even better, just eat the orange and get all the fibre and goodness from the whole fruit, instead of just the juice, which is very high in sugar.And then there was counterfeit food!  John Craven Investigates is a regular feature on Countryfile on a Sunday evening on BBC1 - an excellent programme, and one we usually watch.  Here we learned about honey that may not be what it claims to be, the subtle differences between \"produce of\"/\"sourced from\" and a barrowload of other terms which people can use to mislead the general public to make their produce appear more attractive.All this made me count my blessings and give thanks for the place I live and the opportunities it affords me, the lifestyle I am able to choose to live which allows me to grow food and preserve it simply, the family I have with the years of wisdom to share and learn from, and the skills I have learned and continue to acquire to support my aims and ideals."},
{"title": "Good things all round", "date": "Sunday 27 March 2011", "text": "Today has been an all round good day.  The FH toddled off early to the poultry auction with his friend, and came home happy that they had all sold.  He wasn't that happy about the prices that were achieved, but then again he isn't sure that he heard the prices right for all the pens.  Each pen is supposed to be at least £25, so it wasn't too bad.  Some of them made more, so I will look for the cheque in the post in a couple of weeks, and see what I get then.After he left, I sorted out the remaining chooks into breeding pens.  There are now several ready to be producing hatching eggs - Lancelot and his wives in the Brown Sussex team and Butch and his harem in the Gold Partridge Orpington team (must trim their bottom feathers!) and then each breed also has a reserve cockerel and five hens to grow on for next year's breeding as they should be a year old before they are used for breeding.  There is a trio of Barred Plymouth Rock, which are for the Brussbar programme.  The flock of Light Sussex are just for eggs, and have no cockerel - he made a good dinner a few weeks back.  Now there will be three pens empty in the system, so I am going to attempt to grass them over so that I can rotate the chooks around later in the season and give them access to grass.Lots and lots of washing has been out on the line, blowing madly in the breeze and has come in smelling most divinely of fresh air - no need for fancy conditioners here to add the freshness!  I have also done some gardening and potting up, weeding and generally tidying - it has been lovely to spend some more time in the garden and I have enjoyed the day.  A friend came along and bought some books, and then when I was picking up the YFG from a sleepover this morning, I noticed that a lady I know had a bike for sale, just like mine, but for only £30 - so knowing that the EFG's bike is worn out, we went and had a look!  It is a good bike, and the lady is only selling it because she has a bad knee, so I bought it and the YFG rode it home.  The FH will check it over for me, but I am pretty sure we will be making good use of it - it was a bargain!I have made some more bread today - mixed early this afternoon and cooking now in batches.  Smells are wafting around and making the house very fragrant!"},
{"title": "I have a man!", "date": "Saturday 26 March 2011", "text": "Provocative title this morning!!  It has seemed that the primary teaching profession has become dominated by women, and indeed, the first three people to want to look around the school with a view to applying for the headship have been women.  But now, I have a man wanting to look around.....hence my title today.  One man, three women - he's outnumbered before he starts, but on the internet, he looks as if he has the experience, so we'll have to wait and see what he's like next week, and whether we sufficiently inspire him to apply for the job.  Today has started slightly overcast and chilly but I am hoping that it at least stays dry so that the chooks who are going to be sold tomorrow don't get muddy.  They will be selected tonight in the last hours of daylight, separated and thus be ready to be boxed up early in the morning.  They don't like that bit, but they'll be OK - I hope that they all find good new homes.This afternoon I'll be cleaning the hen houses out, and maybe trying to get another veg bed dug over as well.  Lots to do in the garden at this time of year - and I think that tonight is clock-change night as well so I must check that as we don't want to be late anywhere in the morning.Better get going - washing to hang and all that!"},
{"title": "Catching up", "date": "Wednesday 23 March 2011", "text": "This is one of the magnificent horses we saw at the show on Sunday.Sunday morning dawned bright and clear, and we went off to the show after chapel.  We got to the show by lunchtime so the first thing we did was to find a spot for a picnic.  We went with another family so the FH was outnumbered by 8 females and he wasn't really sure what to think!!  He coped admirably...We saw some beautiful horses, and had a good look around all the stands.  The FH did the best in the shopping stakes, acquiring two new shirts, and a new reversible leather belt, and some of his favourite cheese from the food hall.  The girls had a go on the carousel in the background of the photo above, as they love to do each time we go.  We spent lots of time out in the sunshine and fresh air, and we all slept very well Sunday evening.  It was a lovely day with some great company.Monday was back at school; measures are being put in place to support people so I can step back a little now, thank goodness.  I also showed my first headteacher candidate around - and she was lovely.  I must be careful not to \"like\" any of them more than any other - but I am sure that I will like them all as I do tend to like most people unless they are really objectionable.  I have another to show around tomorrow and another next Tuesday.  Of course, as they book their appointments, I am getting their names - so it is only human nature that I am going to look them up on the internet....there are three or four people with the same name as the woman who is coming tomorrow so she could be the one who is relatively local, she might be the one from Northamptonshire, or she may be moving to the area from Essex.  The local one has a Twitter page and I have learned no end from that - if it is her, she is a grandmother, has two daughters, one of whom has a son, loves gardening, preserving fruits and veg, baking, will be doing the Race for life........there are all sorts of personal things about a person which is all freely available in the public domain that is the internet!  I have also been able to read the latest OFSTED reports from the schools that the other two are currently at - luckily they have less common names!!And then there is the Frugal Queen issue.  There is a link to FQ's blog in my blogroll.  I am so sad about this, as someone nasty has upset FQ to the extent that she temporarily closed her blog, and has now only brought it back to allow 100 people to subscribe to be her followers to whom the blog will be available.  It is despicable behaviour to upset someone like this, and it is such a shame that all her wisdom and inspiration will no longer be available to the wider community.  I think that she should follow Rhonda-Jean's lead and write a book when she finishes teaching as she has so much to offer, and is a true inspiration and leader in frugality.  She will be hugely missed.Hugs to all."},
{"title": "School and more", "date": "Saturday 19 March 2011", "text": "Yes, I was back in there yesterday - thought it would just be for assembly but ended up being all morning, went home at 1.30pm for an hour and then had to be back to prepare and do a staff meeting at 3pm for half an hour. I enjoyed gym last night in the sense of being somewhere else and taking my mind off the situation, but I had terrible cramp in both my feet for several hours, which ended up with the Head Coach telling the EFG to take me to the kitchen and put my feet in some hot water to relax the muscles.  That helped for a couple of hours but by 11pm I had to have a hot bath as the spasm had gone into the shin of one leg - agony!The FH managed to get four adult FREE tickets to the Shire Horse show tomorrow so I am hoping we are all fit and well and raring to go tomorrow, and that the weather is good enough.We're off to gym again this morning, so I must get some washing hung before we go!"},

Having been out this afternoon, the eggs hadn't been all collected this afternoon, so when the FH told me he had brought in 5 this afternoon and promptly sold them to a lady who came to the door, I was pleased at the sale.  But then I wanted an egg to make a quick microwave sponge pud - and there were no eggs! I had to go rummaging around in the hen houses in the dark to find an egg - and I hit the jackpot and came in with 10, taking the day's total to 15!!  So pleased that they are getting into the swing of the idea...and they are getting so much better at actually laying in the nestboxes.Been a busy day - rather brain straining, so I am off to sleep now - good night!"},
{"title": "Bad day in school", "date": "Tuesday 15 March 2011", "text": "The smelly stuff is well and truly beginning to hit the fan, and I may as well have a bed made up in the school as I am spending hours in there.  I was in there yesterday for a couple of hours, and have at least five hours of meetings there tomorrow.   Life is a huge challenge at the moment to cope with it all, and to support those who are at the sharp end.  Tempers are getting very frayed, a lot of people are worried to death, and me, I keep saying, \"Look on the bright side\" or \"Let's think positively!\" - I'm sure someone will want to wallop me soon, but that is the way I think!  So, I'm sorry, but I am managing to go to work at gym, to look after the chooks, and the family, but there is almost no housework getting done (What's new!?!) and I dare say I'll be noticeable by my absence here until perhaps the weekend.  I must try to get a working camera sorted out and take more photos!"},
{"title": "Restful day - not!", "date": "Sunday 13 March 2011", "text": "Sunday being a day of rest....I wish.  I had two loads of washing on the line and the chooks fed and watered before 8am, off to chapel to help lead the service at 9am, and I was home, making marmalade and bread soon after 11am......then it went pear-shaped for a little while whilst I took some time out to eat lunch and watch an old Bronson video with the FH.  The girls went out - my sister came and picked them up at about 11.45am and took them back to town with her.  The YFG wanted to earn some more pocket money for her new phone, so my sister offered to let her do some jobs for her, and the EFG went to her friend's house for the afternoon.  The FH and I pottered in the garden after lunch and cleaned out another chicken house, and then I went off to collect up my girls again.  When we got home, I knocked the dough back and left it to rise again, and then it was baked whilst I was cooking the supper.  The FH helpfully did the ironing during the day, which was a load off my list.  I also arranged collection by courier tomorrow for a beehive which is off to Burton-on-Trent.  That will be picked up in the morning, and should be at the purchaser's address by Tuesday evening.Tonight I have helped the FH to move some chooks around from one house to another, shut the rest up, and had a bath.  The girls are still moving around upstairs, so I must go and hassle them towards their beds.Hope you have all had a good weekend.  I count 12 jars of marmalade, 6 loaves and 17 rolls as a success for today!I didn't see much of the sunshine in the morning as we were in the gym until 1pm, but when we came out to glorious sun and light breezes, we all exclaimed what a lovely day it was.  I had thought that showers were forecast, but they didn't make an appearance here.After gym, the YFG and I began the trek around the town for the new school trousers she needed.  She did an exceptionally deep deep knee bend on Thursday evening for no known reason, and she totally split the crotch area wide open.  I did mend it with my needle and thread, but she said that they were getting rather tight anyway and she was afraid to wear them again in case she split my sewing apart.  Mmmm - doesn't say much about her confidence in my sewing.  Anyway, we started in Tesco, because that was where she usually gets her trousers, but there were none in her size, so we tried the Factory Shop, where there were some horrible specimens, which felt strange and looked stranger, and so to Sainsbury's, where there weren't any at all.  Summer dresses for primary school kids, yes, trousers, no.  And so to the official school outfitter in the town.  They had them in, of course, a whole rail of them.  Twice the price that they would have been in any of the other shops, but you do notice that we went there as the last resort.  So she got a pair, after over an hour of searching, and we came home........Whereupon I had a cup of tea, got changed and went to clean out the big chicken house.  I put the shavings and manure directly into a deep veg bed, where I think I may grow the courgettes this year as I hope they can tolerate fairly \"hot\" conditions.  I know you can grow pumpkins on compost heaps, so courgettes being the same broad family may be OK.  All this chicken poo has to go somewhere, and the compost bins are getting rather full.  The brown bin will get it all next week, but it can't cope with two weeks' worth, I'm afraid, as then no one can move the bin!  The FH was out there as well for some of the time as there were some minor repairs needing doing to the chooks set up - doors that had dropped, etc so he was kept busy for an hour, then he did some pottering in the greenhouse.Baked potatoes and various fillings for tea, and then more washing to be hung out, and the service for chapel this morning to get sorted last night.  I finished that up and went to bed at about 11pm, completely worn out for the day - I like those days, where you know you have really earned your rest at night!Yesterday's news programmes and newspapers were full of information and pictures of the devastation of Japan following the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.  Thousands of people are missing, whole communities completed destroyed, acres of land trashed with debris and homes and lives swept away in the tidal wave that hit the land.  It is tagged as one of the worst natural disasters, and it really puts life into perspective.  It strikes me that life in Japan has always been a little bit fragile because of the Ring of Fire position it sits in on the edge of the Pacific basin, the fact that it is an island nation and so it is vulnerable to the seas, and the sheer population density of the country.  Although they are on the other side of the world, and I know no one in Japan personally, my heart goes out to the Japanese people as a nation, both those who were there at the time, and all their relatives scattered across the world who will be emotionally affected by it all even if they are not physically harmed.  Remember them in your thoughts and prayers if you will."},
{"title": "Looking forward...", "date": "Friday 11 March 2011", "text": "to the weekend!  It's Friday again already - can't believe how quickly the weeks are flying past.  It is Lent now, so only 6 weeks to Easter and we should be feeling by then that Spring has really sprung - the seeds should be in the pots and we should be getting the garden into full swing.  Can't wait!!I made an early start yesterday and got three banana cakes and a batch of flapjack in the oven first thing, but I still haven't done the chooks - they are on the agenda for Friday or Saturday, depending on the weather.I'm being a bit lax on the Lent front this year and not setting myself any challenges to do anything extra or give up anything - I don't feel able!  There simply isn't time in the day to do any more at the moment, and as for giving up something, it would have to be something boring like crisps or cake or puddings, and then I would feel that that was a bit of a cop out, so I am copping out completely!  I should, I ought to, those are words which induce feelings of guilt, so I am putting them aside and just doing my best.Yesterday we had a surprise - my sister has asked me to change the week I had booked at the caravan in Norfolk for a different week - so instead of going in the Summer term's half-term break, we'd be going in August.  I did say that I wouldn't be going for the whole week even if we went in August, as at £40 a night, I don't want to pay out nearly £300 for a week in a caravan when we had a week in a fully-equipped house for that price last year.  I know that the travel costs will be less, but we had decided not to have a \"holiday\" this year and just to go away for a few nights, which was what I had booked originally.  She had a bit of a \"dig\" at me, saying, \"What do you mean, you can't afford a week?\" but what I can and cannot afford is down to me and the choices we make as a family.   A whole week there can also get rather claustrophobic, as we feel that we are on top of one another in the caravan, and the girls have to share a bedroom, which they find difficult.  As the EFG said last night when we were discussing it, the whole thing involves so much more than just paying for the caravan, as we visit shops that we don't go to usually, and we appreciate eating out at least once whilst we are there, and then if we want to go swimming or visit local attractions, there are other costs involved - and it all adds up!  Wise words from one so young.  So we'll see.  We went to Scotland last year because the sister in question mucked up the booking at the caravan before, so I can see us going elsewhere for a couple of days this year.......With the help of the lovely assistant secretary at the school, I finally got the applicant's pack for the Headteacher post finished yesterday, and emailed off to the personnel provider, so that they have it ready for the hordes (we hope!) of people who will be requesting it from next week!STOP PRESS - my sister has just phoned me and said that the caravan situation has been resolved and we can still go when we had originally booked it for in the June half-term!!!  Excellent news!And so to Friday's jobs: more washing, delivering some eggs to a lady in the village, a couple of phone calls, sorting out the service for chapel on Sunday, and some paperwork - and then to pick up the girls at 3.30pm and off to gym we go!  Have a good day - the sum is shining here at the moment but my thoughts are with the people of Japan after the earthquake and tsunami that they are experiencing today.  God bless them all."},

I had plans this morning that included cleaning out chooks, making banana bread, putting clean clothes away etc and instead I have had to have various conversations by email and telephone and I haven't got much of that stuff done at all!!  I did get the ironing finished up at lunchtime, and the YFG has been cleaning the kitchen up tonight to earn herself some extra pocket money, so the chores are still getting done...I have just watched Guy Martin on BBC1 on a programme about a narrowboat, and I can't recommend it highly enough!  I sat there the full half hour with a smile on my face...he is like a younger version of Fred Dibnah in his inquisitive nature and his old-fashioned respect for the likes of Watt and Crapper, but he is a bit more lively in his presenting style, and I would say appeals to a much wider audience.  I hadn't a clue who he was last week when I watched the first episode but to those in the know, apparently he's a motorbike racer from Lincolnshire with fans worldwide - who'd have thought it?!The girls are watching Waterloo Road now, whilst eating their tea.  The FH went out to lunch and is now asleep with a banging headache - I think a bad cold or a touch of a fluey illness is on its way for him.  He'll be off to bed shortly, I think.Night, all!"},

I know it won't last for ever, but what will?!On that note, we were fascinated to watch some of Prof Brian Cox's programme on BBC2 last night about the Wonders of the Universe.  The YFG was glued to the tv, and you could see her trying to understand the huge numbers he was talking about in terms of the years that the sun has left, and the earth as well, before the universe becomes nothing, and the \"arrow of time\" being measured by things changing.....the YFG wondered if he had swallowed a dictionary as he knew so many big words, and was convinced that he didn't really Know all these things, he was just reading them off cue cards!!  We explained that he is pretty bright, a professor indeed, so he probably does Know these things!  I notice that Amazon have his book for £10, and the Book People have it for £7.99, but I would have to pay postage from them.....I might get it.....I might not!The thing that made me think last night was about being a Christian physicist.  How do people manage to keep a faith, when all this information tries to convince one that there can be no God?  I don't know - I'm glad I am not a physicist - but I decided that if the earth and everything in the universe will be gone eventually (can't even begin to try to remember how many trillions of trillions of years he was talking, so \"eventually\" should cover it!) then why can't that be part of God's mysterious plan?  It is something I want to understand more about in the future."},

It will be an early start for me as I have to be there for 8.15am to get set up and ready to sell from 8.45am!  Should all be done by 10am though, so I can come home and put my feet up with a cuppa for a couple of hours before gym.Today I have no school meeting, thank goodness, and only an afterschool gym club to run later on.  I don't have to go anywhere or be anywhere until about 2.15pm so I can move a little more slowly this morning.......I have spared a thought for the Head Coach who should right now be in the air on his way to his week's holiday somewhere warm - Lanzarote?

I spent a good hour and a half on a Word document which ran to several pages - I have to prepare an Applicants' Pack for the Headteacher vacancy at the school.  It will be printed and comb bound as a booklet, so it will be quite thick.....and with just one click of the mouse in the wrong place, I lost the lot yesterday afternoon.  I hadn't saved it whilst I was working on it, and despite another hour's attempts to recover it, it has gone........and so I will have to do it all again, hopefully today.That put me in a bad temper, I am afraid, and I wasn't really in the mood to go and be nice to a load of little girls at gymnastics, but as is always the case, once I got there, I was able to focus on the gym and forget the rest of the world and its troubles - and I was soon fine again!One thing I have got to refocus on again is MONEY!!  We are not poverty stricken, we are not on the breadline, but we do have to be careful to make the best use of every pound that we get our hands on - and what with the rising prices in all sorts of areas, it is beginning to feel like the money is slipping through our fingers too quickly.  I am not going to say that I don't know where it is going, because I do, but I feel that it is moving through the system too quickly - it seems that no sooner do I fill the car with petrol than I am having to go back for more, and it is the same in other areas - the weekly shop is costing more each week, it seems, and I really want to stop and get a hold of all of this before it escalates.

The FH took the YFG to Cambridge in the morning to the orthodontist to get her braces checked, and she came out with the wires having been altered, which means that today, she is in pain and can't eat a lot!  Back to the spaghetti hoops and macaroni cheese for a couple of days, I think.  I am sending her to school with a most unhealthy lunch, a slice of soft ginger cake and a Muller corner yoghurt, but also with £2 so that she can buy something from the cafe if there is anything there that she thinks she can eat.  Whilst the FH was out, I took advantage of the quiet to do one of the Davina workouts for half an hour!  Then I had a shower and hit the ironing pile again - and got through it.....but made more by changing our bed and doing a load of washing.  It was very damp and drizzly yesterday so I am still not able to hang washing right outside, it only gets as far as the verandah, so that is where I will be hanging it all out this morning.  I am very envious of people who are saying that they are able to hang washing outside!!At 1.30pm I was at the school for a meeting with the Head about the procedures for recruiting a new Head since she is retiring.  That lasted until nearly 3pm, when I then came home and grabbed a pair of the EFG's jeans that need shortening, and went off to the town to pick the girls up from school and take the jeans to the shop.  We stopped off at the supermarket for supplies, a friend's house for a quick chat, and the Post Office, and got home by 5pm.  The YFG has been asking for lasagne for a while now, and it is such a faff to make that I keep putting it off, but I made it last night - one to eat and one to freeze!  The second one was bunged in the fridge last night, so that will make it into the freezer today.  Some darling girls we know who are triplets have their birthday today, so I wrapped their gifts last night and popped along to their house quite late when I knew they would be in bed! Chatting with their mum meant that when I got home last night it was gone 10pm, and time for bed.Today the EFG has a GCSE Maths exam, so she is a bit nervous and says she can't remember much, although she does OK in tests, so I have my fingers and toes crossed for her.  She did an English paper yesterday on John Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\" which the other kids did the week before half term when she was off sick.  She thinks it went OK!And so off into the day we go again - hope you all have a good one..."},
{"title": "That was the weekend that went too fast!", "date": "Sunday 27 February 2011", "text": "And it flew past - I don't even remember much of yesterday!  I spent a lot of the day unearthing the hallway (it's quite big when it isn't cluttered with Stuff!) and then the office got a bit of a makeover going on in there too!  Today was church, and I am terribly uncharitable, but the preacher this morning was a drag.....people will say that of me one day, I know, but she said, \"you know\" 100 times if she said it once, and we were exchanging sidelong glances between ourselves before half time!!  Surely someone closer to her would tell her that she does it, so that she could work on stopping.......I certainly hope that they wouldn't let me go on like that.Got to go - early start for folk here in the morning - back to school and the YFG has to go to Cambridge for a checkup on her braces."},
{"title": "Mint sauce", "date": "Friday 25 February 2011", "text": "Yep - the first Spring lambs of the year were seen today in the local fields!  I took the girls to the cinema to see \"I am Number Four\" (no idea who the lead couple were, but I liked Henri, played by Timothy Olyphant and then killed off - shame!) with the Tesco Clubcard vouchers.  The cinema was heaving with kids and their families - but then they were showing Yogi Bear and Gnomeo & Juliet at the same time, so I guess that is where a lot of them were, as the cinema we were in wasn't that full.We then went to Staples to find that cirlce-drawing thingy, and couldn't, so the EFG has deigned to say she will use a compass if it comes up in the exam on Tuesday - hurray for common sense at last!  After that, we went in to the big Tesco there, where the EFG found some jeans and a top she liked and the YFG got a dress and leggings set.  The EFG is so \"not into\" clothes that I do tend to buy her whatever she sees and likes as so many times I try to buy her things and she hates everything in sight and we come away empty handed.And so to tonight - I came home, collected the eggs up, cooked the tea and we ate - and then I fell asleep.......I have done that a couple of times this week, so I must be tired!! And we are not getting up early either - it was past 8 when I got my feet to the floor this morning, and I had already had a text message from a friend who was bright and breezy at 7.30am.  And the weekend is here tomorrow - so I am planning to have some time at home tomorrow sorting out the school uniforms and such, ready for Monday.  I may also do some bread baking - I am looking forward to the smell of fresh bread!!Yesterday morning was a busy \"being out\" time - the YFG had an appointment at the optician, then we made best use of our petrol by hitting the library, the bank, two supermarkets, WHSmith, and the Head Coach's house as well - and plopped back down here by 1pm, ready for lunch.We made a major error in WHSmith, and forgot (well, she didn't remind me!) to buy a thing for the EFG for drawing circles.  Back in the day, I used a compass to draw a circle, didn't you? These days, they have to have a thing that looks like two protractors joined together, so they can just draw around it........methinks teachers are finding it too difficult to explain the process of drawing a circle with a compass...shame!  The FH was a technical drawing teacher, and can do amazing geometry from his time as a carpenter, so he was extremely shocked at this revelation.I had to go to the HC house as we are applying for some funding for the gym club, and had some forms to fill in.  I came home with onions and potatoes, as well as some odd tins of groceries that his mother-in-law had received in a hamper and not wanted, and he didn't want them either. Nothing wrong with them - a tin of tuna, some peas and carrots, and a tin of steak in gravy - perfect for a pie.This afternoon, I will be taking the girls to the cinema as the Tesco clubcard voucher tokens arrived yesterday.  There is a Staples shop in the vicinity, so we will have to look and see if they sell these strange circle-drawing implements....."},
{"title": "Lee and Jack", "date": "Wednesday 23 February 2011", "text": "My cousin's husband lent me a bag of books by Lee Child after he saw \"61 Hours\" on my bookshelf. These books, featuring the enigmatic Jack Reacher, have become addictive.  I tear through each one in a couple of days, and can't wait to grab the next one from the bag.  I have read all bar one of them now, and have even looked on Amazon to see if there are more.....and there may be a film - I have found a website dedicated to the debate over which actor would be best as JR.  I'm with the Hugh Jackman posse, I have to say, although I think Hugh would have to put on some weight!!I went to a meeting tonight in the village about the development of a new Parish Plan - a visionary document which drives the way the village should develop over the next 10 or so years.  There was a lot of interest, because people didn't really understand the concept to start with, and thought that they could go along and lobby the parish council about the state of the roads or the sewers, or the local bus services or the threatened closure of the fire station.......but then there was some apathy when it was realised that this Parish Plan may take a year or longer to draw up and then begin to implement.  I went along to represent the Methodist Chapel with the steward, and I was also there with a bit of the school hat on as well.  The steward was keen that I go forward onto the Steering group which will begin all the work on surveying the parishioners about what they want the Plan to do.  I agreed, and put my name down, but I told her in no uncertain terms that if the amount of time it takes up becomes oppressive, I will have to stop.  I will certainly not be taking on an officer role in the committee.  I shall sit on my hands if I get the slightest inkling that one might shoot up and betray me!  I do think that it is a good idea, and I am interested to know what it will involve.  Members of our street committee were there, and promised me that they would support me as well, so if there is footwork needing to be done in the area, they will do it for me.I really shouldn't have.  But I read that there was a 10% discount code (AP10) valid until the 27th February, and then when I went looking, they have Matthew Walker Christmas Puddings (one of the best kinds) - the 454g size - for just 99p.  So I did........The girls are enjoying some Wagon Wheels biscuits that I bought from Approved Food - and it has brought up an interesting thought.  The EFG was reading the description on the pack, and it said that they are filled with, \"raspberry flavoured plum jam\".  What do you make of that?  We had a conversation about the concept of raspberry-flavoured plums being made into jam, or plum jam having raspberry flavouring added to it.......what is the food industry coming to?  Why not just use plum jam? But what kind of plums would you use?  To those of us who know, there is a wealth of difference between, say, Victoria plum jam, River plum jam and Monarch plum jam - and then there is Greengage - my favourite.  It does no justice to the plums to call it \"plum\" jam - but then perhaps it is a mixture.....There are downsides to buying food from AF - more processed food.  BUT I am trying to balance it out by using the food in meals with \"real\" food so using the pasta packets as a side dish with pork chops and vegetables, for example, rather than as a meal on their own.  AF is a marvel for loo roll - I have a serious stash now, and we should be set for the foreseeable future in that department!!The chickens are on the move - 6 pens totalling 19 chooks - have been entered for the purebreed sale at Mildenhall on the 27th March.  They are all rare - Gold Partridge Orps and Brown Sussex.  That will reduce the amount here and we can then get started on this year's plans, which are more modest!The weather in the Fens has been dire just lately and I am ready for spring - sunshine and showers would be a vast improvement on rain, rain and more rain.......it is getting depressing.  I have to be very careful about depression at this time of year, as my mum died in February 1998, and then Mother's Day is in March, followed in quick succession by her birthday in April so I have three months of memories.......it has been a very dark time for me in years past but I am getting better at remembering the good times and thinking less about how much I miss her. There is an excellent passage in a Katie Fforde book which I would share with you if I knew where the right book was, but it goes along the lines of bereavement being like a darn in a sock: there is a gaping hole in your life at first, but then the years go by and you learn to begin to cope and you begin to fill the hole with the strands of life.  Eventually, the hole is closed with all the strands but it is never as new again as there is a large darn in the sock which reminds you of the loved person all the time, but it is no longer a stonking great big hole the way it was at the beginning.  My darn is no longer raw, but it is always going to be there in my sock.I felt disrespected at the school last week - I had an email in which I felt I had been summoned to see the Head like a naughty school child, and I don't appreciate that.  It has left me wondering why I bother........and then I had an email from a fellow Chair of Governors elsewhere in support of all that we do, and she reminded me that as we are both Christians, we do this in Jesus' strength, so I am going to carry on, because I strongly feel that things need to change, and I am a bit like the chap on Mastermind, \"I've started, so I'll finish!\"  I feel that I would be letting some other people down if I don't carry through what I have started, but I would be grateful for those of you who pray to include me in your prayers on this for the rest of the school year.......5 months down and 5 more to go to July!Half-term is upon us and the girls are enjoying some freedom from normal routine; on Monday, they had a very leisurely day!  Yesterday, they painted the EFG's room and rearranged it, today they spent the morning on the YFG's room and now the FH has taken them across to Peterborough to do some visiting.  We have the YFG at the optician tomorrow morning, and then the library to visit.  We are hoping to go to the cinema to see \"The King's Speech\" if the Tesco Clubcard vouchers get here on time, but if not, we'll go to see something else at Easter.  There is a local car boot sale on Saturday in aid of another Methodist chapel in our circuit on Saturday, so if the weather forecast is favourable, we may go to that.  Sunday will be spent getting ready to get back into the swing of life again!!Hope you are all well, and I am sorry that I haven't been around lately - I'll try to keep up more regularly now........."},

{"title": "650 and counting", "date": "Monday 14 February 2011", "text": "Gosh - 650 posts - I had a mooch around the Stats page this morning and was surprised a little at what I found.  A lot of traffic comes here from Silversewer's blog, and then from GTM's blog, and the most popular post, with the most page views, was Sausage Plait - when I gave detailed instructions with photos for a \"how to make\" post.  People out there must like recipes!  Over 9200 page views since I started - I am chuffed at how many people read my waffle!Anyway - must apologise that I am not here an awful lot just lately.  There are three big issues going on at school and that is taking a lot of my time, and my mental energy as I have to read up on how to deal with these things, and the procedures and regulations concerning them.  Meetings as well!  Then there is gym - we are working for another competition - but we don't yet know when it is so we have the added pressure of not knowing the level of urgency with which we need to train them.....if it turns out to be soon, perhaps we will have to add in another training session for a couple of weeks to help the girls learn their floor routines.  The YFG has grown out of this level of competition and will be working for one in early summer so she has started to work on some of the stuff necessary for that.  The FH sowed the tomato seeds and they have come through at last - he was getting very disheartened that they were taking so long to come through and then a whole load of them came up on the same day, so he is relieved.  The lettuces that he overwintered in the greenhouse are big enough to eat now, so he is nibbling away at those with his sandwiches at lunchtimes and is very pleased with that idea.  He had been worried that they would all die in the really cold weather, but they have come through and are perfectly edible and taste fine.  It is nice to be able to have some early greens at this time of year - there isn't an awful lot of nutrition in a lettuce leaf, I know, but he likes them!And so to today - school meeting at 10.15am, church council tonight at 8pm, and the gang will be off to band practise between 6.30pm and 8pm so we'll have our tea before they go out.  In between the meetings today, I need to get some washing done (MORE washing!), put the ironing away that the FH did yesterday, and do something with the mountain of paper in the office - I swear it is breeding.......the EFG said that it couldn't last night when I told her my thought, but I think it does!Yesterday I went on a gym training course at Marriott's Gym in Stevenage - we were in the PE classroom, but the gym was very close by and we had time to watch the gymnasts training.  I was so impressed and rather green with envy at their equipment and facilities!  That was the best part about going - the training course was rather \"pants\" as one of the other students described it - the tutor had only 3 hours to get through a mountain of slides and activities - she said she could spend no more than 30 secs per slide and 2 minutes per activity - and she had us doing these activities but didn't have time to give us the right answers to most of them, so we didn't know if we had got it right.  We have ended up with a great resource book, full of forms and plans to use in the admin side of the gym, but the level of info we received was minimal.  It was nice to see some familiar faces from other gyms, and catch up on their news, but the course itself was disappointing.Yesterday evening, I sat in the chair with my feet up and had a snooze, and then I watched tv for three hours or so - Antiques roadshow (I might have slept through some of that!), Countryfile, a bit of Larkrise to Candleford and then Wild at Heart - that is a) the longest I have sat still in a chair for a long time and b) the most TV I have watched for a Very Long time - but I was tired after the day!"},
{"title": "Electricity - and feeling flush in the Fens, too", "date": "Thursday 10 February 2011", "text": "The electricity company got back to me, and offered me the chance to pay the £180 extra as a one-off cheque payment, which I have accepted, otherwise they wanted to raise our monthly payment to almost £80.  I have agreed to raise it to about £65, but that seems like a lot to me, so I will be keeping a very sharp eye on the meter - I have read it today and we have used £20 of electricity in 10 days - £2 a day then.  I will have to look at what we do and see if there are ways of reducing that.  Five refrigerating items are not good - three freezers and two fridges.......might be a place to start.UJ came over to go to the lunch club yesterday, and has indicated that he will be attending each week now, which will be a good thing in my opinion.  He is in a lot of pain, and the paracetamol/codeine tablets are also constipating him into the bargain so he isn't too chuffed with it all at the moment.  I have recommended another visit with the doctor.The weather has given in to the rain and it is pouring down here this afternoon.  I am having a break at the moment - the dentist was the first trip of the day for a checkup, and I came out £17 lighter, and no further treatment necessary, thank goodness.  We then went to the tip with a carload of rubbish, thence to Tesco for some shopping and for the FH to get a passport sized photo so that he can send in his application for a blue badge.  I got a huge lump of boiling bacon at half price, so that is boiling away now, and will be sliced up for tea and some for the freezer, most likely.Gymnastics after-school club is the next thing, and then I have to go south towards Cambridge for another governor training meeting tonight - it is at Wood Green Animal Shelter - I hope that they have a conference room there somewhere, as I don't fancy being out with the sheep!  I'll get home by about 10pm tonight, so it will have been a  long day.....The \"feeling flush\" is that the Tesco vouchers arrived today - £23odd - so I now have about £50 of them squirreled away, and I am wondering whether to keep them together for a larger item, whether to change some for cinema vouchers for the girls to have a treat at half-term, or whether to look and see what else there is available on the website.......ho hum - decisions!"},
{"title": "Catching up with myself at last", "date": "Monday 7 February 2011", "text": "Gosh, was it really last Wednesday since I was here?!  I am getting slack!The Governor training went well last Wednesday, and I feel more confident about what I am trying to do there.  The group I sat with was the same as the previous time and we exchanged contact details so we can stay in touch, which was a good thing to do, I thought. It just gives us all that extra little bit of support and somewhere to ask questions and bounce ideas around.The EFG had Wednesday and Thursday off school, but went back on Friday.  She helped out at gym as well, and felt a lot better than she had done. Friday was the Coffee morning at chapel, and I just didn't get around to making any baking, so I took along some cakes from the AF delivery - some Angel slices, a ginger cake and a marmalade cake.  One of the other people there was obviously disappointed not to get some home baking because she disappeared off to a shop in the village and bought three home-made style cakes for the refreshments.  This made me quite cross, because they have \"let\" me provide most of the baking for the last x number of events, and then when I don't, they can go and buy some - why couldn't they do that before and take some of the pressure off me?  Hopefully they will be reconsidering their expectations in the light of my non-production this time, and expect less.  The coffee morning was generally successful and put £170 into the coffers of the chapel.  The steward was telling me on Sunday how much repair work the chapel needs, so it is important that we continue to raise money for the funds as the circuit doesn't help us with that sort of thing.On Saturday, after gym, the FH took the girls to my sister's house, and they went off to the Holiday on Ice performance at the East of England showground in Peterborough.  They really enjoyed the show and then my sister fed them, and kept them at hers until the FH and I got home after the Songs of Praise we did at the chapel on Saturday evening.  It went well, and people enjoyed it, but we could have done with more people there to sing!!Yesterday was the chapel anniversary, so the preacher brought a cake to use as part of the sermon, and then left it for the congregation to share afterwards, which was a lovely gesture.  My dad came to tea in the late afternoon, bringing sad news that one of his oldest friends had died on Thursday - he had just had the phone call to tell him the news as he was leaving to come here so it was very fresh in his mind.  His friend had become weak, and living alone, his son had thought it best to move him to a retirement home, which my dad had visited several times to see him, and the gentleman had seemed very happy there, with the care he was receiving.  Unfortunately, although his general health had been improved and was now good, he had had a stroke and been admitted to hospital, and then had died.  RIP Vic.  The funeral is next Monday.And so to today.  The FH is off to Hinchingbrooke hospital for a check up on his prostate gland again, I am due at school at 11am to chat with other governors and an inspector about Leadership & Management in the school, and then I have to go back at 2.30pm to receive their feedback with the Head, the AF delivery is due this afternoon, and then the gang have band practice tonight.  I want to get some more bread made, and some more digging done as well, so I shall have to find time, and pace myself, to get it all done.  There's housework looking at me as well, but I did finish the ironing last night, so that is out of the way for a couple of days.I saw some snowdrops on the way home from chapel yesterday which cheered me no end - spring is on its way!!"},
{"title": "Challenges on a Wednesday", "date": "Wednesday 2 February 2011", "text": "This is going to sound like a moan, so I am sorry, Kim!!  There have been a few things happen this week which need addressing:The electricity meter hasn't been read lately and we are paying estimated amounts to the company - trouble is, I discovered yesterday that the meter readings they are estimating are about £290 behind the actual meter reading - ouch!  So, will they accept a lump sum payment to get the situation square, or will they want to increase the monthly DD to make the difference up gradually?  It would be less trouble for me to pay a lump sum and then increase the DD slightly, I think.  I have emailed them to get in touch so we can sort it out - I am not phoning them on a premium rate number!The EFG had Monday off school, went in yesterday morning and then I was called at lunchtime to fetch her home - she looks like she has flu to me, so she will be staying in bed for a few days, drinking plenty and taking paracetamol.  She's pretty wiped out, so plenty of rest is on the agenda for her.My Uncle, UJ, has had a hip replacement operation years ago - so many that I don't remember how many - and now it looks like it has worn out, and the other hip has gone as well.  He went to hospital yesterday for tests/X-rays etc to see what is going on, but if he has to have more operations, we will need to be thinking about how the family will care for him.  He lives alone, about 25 miles away, in a big 5 bedroom house with over a quarter of an acre of veg garden and fruit orchard.  The house does have a stairlift from when my gran was alive, so it is the ideal place to care for him, but it is beginning to look like the FH would have to be the one to go and do it, which is not ideal, but we are scratching our heads to work out how else to help him....and if he is less able and more fragile whilst he is waiting for an op, he will also need looking after in the meantime, and that could be a more long-term problem, knowing what NHS waiting lists are like these days.Frustrated because I sat here last night doing the Volvo car insurance on the Post Office website - had a good quote and cashback from them for the Vectra so thought I would go back for the Volvo - got all the way through the site to the payment and then it said there was an Error and I would have to ring up Customer Services, who couldn't be sure I would still get the £25.25 cashback, so I declined to carry on at that point and said I would try again - but I suspect that the website did it to avoid paying me cashback again - or is that being paranoid!?!  Have to try again somewhere anyway - blooming car has to be insured by the 20th.One of the situations at school will probably go public to the other governors today, so I am preparing myself for some long conversations!I am off to Cambridge today for another \"Taking the Chair\" course - 1.30pm to 6pm.  Luckily this is the second half of the course and I met some lovely people last time, so I am hoping to sit with them again and the time will pass more quickly!  It is an interesting course, but there is a lot to take in and I tend to get a bit overloaded!!  Driving home in the dark will also be a challenge as I hate it.......I'll report back tomorrow - hope you all have a good day!  It is misty and cold here in the Fens this morning, so not much incentive to get out and about..."},
{"title": "Granary greatness!", "date": "Sunday 30 January 2011", "text": "Just a very quick post to say that the bread came out of the oven last night at about 12.20am (far too late!!) and I wrapped it all up in tea towels and left it to cool.  I sliced it this morning and the FH has pronounced the Granary loaf \"the best ever\" so I am well chuffed!  It is now all sliced up and most of it is in the freezer in half-loaf portions.  He had some for breakfast with HM gooseberry jam, and then a chicken and pickle sandwich for tea, so multiple chances to taste it already.  Unfortunately the YFG has declared it inedible as \"it's got bits in in\" - yes, dear - those are the seeds that give it the distinctive flavour - she'll be sticking to the white version, me thinks!"},
{"title": "Weekend again", "date": "Saturday 29 January 2011", "text": "I can't believe that just weeks ago it was Christmas, and now it will be February next week - the time is flying past and a twelfth of the year is past!  There are signs of Spring in the air again since the days are getting that little bit lighter, the hens are starting to lay again, and the seeds are on sale in Lidl!  It is a good time of year - time to look forward, think about what we did last year and how we can do it differently this year if last year didn't quite go to plan - learn from our mistakes, I suppose. My biggest thing will be to get the whole thing underway outside earlier this year!  We need to sow tomato and pepper seeds earlier, get the incubator going earlier, and think about the raised beds needing compost now.....and then things might happen a little better this year, depending on the weather, and the fertility of the eggs.....Today I had to lead the gym class as the Head Coach has been ill - he rang me at  9am and said he wouldn't make it in today.  We managed fine, although it was typical that when we are a coach down, every child on the register would turn up!  After gym, the YFG and I had a saunter around Tesco, then the feed shop for some corn and some breeder pellets for the breeding chooks.  These are expensive, so they are carefully metered out to particular birds - and not yet, as the breeding groups aren't organised yet.......that is another job for this week.Everyone seems tired here tonight - I had a nap for about 90 minutes earlier, the FH has gone to bed to watch some tv and the YFG has gone with him as she isn't feeling quite right, and the EFG has a cold.  I think they could all do with a day in bed!!  The FH has had a glass of Tesco's version of Bailey's Irish Cream tonight - a very small amount in a sherry glass - as I bought it to make fudge at Christmas and there is a lot left to be used within three months, so he is helping me out with that - he thinks it helps him to sleep but I am not sure that the very small amount I gave him would make a lot of difference but perhaps it is a psychological effect.I have bread rising near the fire, so since it is still at the first rising stage, I will be up for some time yet - I have made a batch of plain white dough and then another batch which is 2/3 granary mix and 1/3 white, so I am hoping that it will not be too heavy.  I'll knock it back at 10pm and it should be in the oven by about 11........bed by 12 tonight then - good job I have a folder full of gym stuff to sort out which totally fell apart this morning - and there might be something half decent to watch on the tv whilst I do it!"},
{"title": "Seeing double", "date": "Thursday 27 January 2011", "text": "The Approved Foods delivery was here at 12.30pm and then the fun began!  I knew I had ordered four big packs of loo roll so I wasn't surprised that there were two boxes as I wasn't sure that it would all fit into one.  The FH loves unpacking deliveries so he dived right in and started on one of the boxes and I on the other one - and then the duplications started to emerge - I was crossing things off the list as we found them and he would say he had got so and so and then I would realise that I had already unpacked some of those and crossed them off - we had got exactly DOUBLE what I ordered - 20 Five Alive cartons instead of 10, 8 bags of crisps instead of 4 and on and on....For about two seconds, I was tempted to keep quiet, and then I realised that this was a mistake and someone could get into trouble for this lot going missing, so I phoned up and Lisa was rather mystified, but she sorted it out and has arranged for the courier to come back in the morning and pick the extras up, so we repackaged them and they are ready by the door!  Hats off to AF customer service.I have also arranged for Autoglass to come and repair a chip in the windscreen of the Vectra in the morning, so the FH will have a morning waiting for the doorbell to ring.  I am taking the EFG to hospital to have an ultrasound as the doc wants to rule out polycystic ovaries.......I have explained to her that for it to work she has to be fit to bust for a wee, so she will be drinking a lot in the morning!!The hens are beginning to lay again - put out the flags!  Seven one day this week, only two today, but it will be hit and miss for a few weeks until they get themselves back into the swing of it, and the new layers have to learn to drop the precious cargo in the nest boxes and not just where ever they want to.... I have found a couple in the runs so far.Our lovely friend B has been round and cut the girls' hair tonight and they both look great - she always does an excellent job. I would usually trade her a cake for the hairdos, but I was short of time this week and so I popped into the shop and bought her a box of chocs instead, which she was thrilled to receive - happiness all round.A proud mama moment!  The EFG came home with her Statistics test result earlier in the week and we were over the moon with her test score - 100%!!!! She reminded us that she had scored 100% in a maths test before and we hadn't been so excited, but now that she is 14, nearly 15, and doing GCSE work, it seems more significant somehow to realise that she does know what she is doing and clearly understands the work well. SO chuffed!!I had an appointment in Huntingdon yesterday so I went to the Big Brands For Less shop in Ramsey on the way.  I wanted to pick up more of the bread mix as I am so pleased with it - so I got 10 bags - for just £10.  Let's get the calculator out!! Each bag weighs 7.7lbs, and it takes me 3lbs of mix to make 2 large loaves of bread at a time.  All I add is water, at minimal cost, so I am going to overlook that for now.  Each bag therefore makes 5 large loaves of bread, at a cost of 20p a loaf.   I know that we should factor in some electricity, but I think that is not going to be a lot - I could cook 4 loaves in the oven at a time, and it is on for about 45 minutes.  Moneysavingexpert forum posters reckon an average oven uses about 3kW/hour, so that would be 2.25 kW for 45 minutes - and I am paying 9.98p per KwH with uwclub........so am I right in thinking it costs me less than 23p to run the oven for an hour........gosh, this is too early for maths!!  If I rounded the 23p to 24p for the sake of the maths, each loaf would cost less than 25p - and that is a definite saving on \"good\" bread in the shops which is over a £1 a loaf, and even \"cheap\" bread is nearly 50p a loaf at the big supermarkets, so I am making a good quality loaf at less than half the price of cheap bought stuff.  Result!The lady in the shop said that they have been selling that breadmix for well over a year, so I am keeping my fingers crossed that they continue to be able to source it.  I still have two bags of the Granary mix which I am going to try this week when I bake - maybe later today - but I am tempted to cut it with some of the white mix as I am not sure that the gang will like straight Granary...I have another order from Approved Food coming today - the text has arrived to say that the delivery will be made between 12.07 and 13.07 so we will see how precise they are today!  I have re-ordered some products we liked, but not everything that we bought last time is available again, and new things are on offer - Nouvelle loo roll this time, for example - 9 rolls for £2.60.  That loo roll is particularly good for here as it breaks down easily for our septic tanks, so I think I ordered four packs of it!  I may have to think of new and creative places to store it all as the current loo roll store is still quite well packed with the Nouvelle that Tesco were selling at half price before Christmas!The children are very adaptable and thought of new ways to eat the things I had bought last time - the YFG has become fond of the Savoury Rice as a breakfast choice!!  The only trouble with that is that the fastest way to cook it still takes at least 10 minutes and then it is a hot meal to eat so she has to think of what she wants early enough to have time to cook it and eat it.  That is one of the items not available at present, so she has about 4 or 5 sachets left.  I had thought that the rice would be served beside some more veg and perhaps fish, for example, serving the three of them ( I can't eat it because of the wheat/dairy intolerances) but it seems to serve one person adequately if that is all they are eating for that meal.Well, off into the day I go - chickens, washing, tidying, ironing, baking, coaching, cooking, chatting as well, no doubt!  Have a good day, everyone :-)"},
{"title": "Settling down", "date": "Monday 24 January 2011", "text": "I re-read an email I sent to Silversewer a while back and it came to me that I had understood myself so well all of a sudden in that email, so (apologies SS) I am going to share part of that here:  \"Now that we have been back down here 10 years, it is hard to know where we belong.  We feel like we have settled here now, but we have moved three times since we came back, and have been in this house 6 years.  The girls were both born at Forth Park maternity hospital in Kirkcaldy, and are proud to be Scottish-born, if not Scottish-bred!  I used to think I would go back to Cupar in a heartbeat, but we have got so involved here now that I think it would be a wrench to leave all this now - and I think that is what I missed about Cupar when we left - we had a \"place\" there in the community, and now that we have found our places here, we are actually quite happy here too.  I do miss living in a town, though - we spend far too much time travelling here, whereas there we could walk just about anywhere we needed to go.  The girls have to go to school on the bus, and we use the cars (now we have to have two) virtually every day.  Having said that, I wouldn't fancy living in any of the towns round here, and I am grateful in some ways that living here stops the girls going out and hanging around in the streets - not that I would let them anyway, but they don't expect to be able to go out to hang around here - there's nowhere to hang!!  I am happy for their friends to come here, and at least I know that they are all safe that way.  We also have my dad, my uncle and my sister within a 20 mile radius now, so we see them more often.  I do thank God for the internet - living out here without it would be challenging - and I hate shopping with a passion!!  I can't understand people who say they have been to Cambridge or Peterborough to the shops for recreation - if I can't get it in the little town 8 miles away, I send for it on the internet, we make it or we do without!!\"It seems a bit strange to me that in that moment of writing to someone I didn't know, I could all of a sudden have that clarity, and realise that it is not where I live that it is important, but it is the feeling that I belong there that matters, and makes us happy there.  It has taken me a while to reach this conclusion, but actually I think that I have had this feeling of contentment in the area for a while now, and I don't long to be elsewhere any more!!"},
{"title": "Ups and downs", "date": "Saturday 22 January 2011", "text": "I have had a very rough couple of days with things going on at the school and I am quite wrung out over it all!  I have had long conversations with a number of people, official and otherwise, and things are beginning to happen........someone said that the powers that be won't do anything and I said that I will not let the situation be swept under the carpet.  Another person questioned why I put myself through all this, and the answer to that is that I don't pass the buck when the going gets tough - I have been elected to this position for a year (at our school - other schools do it for different periods) and I will see it through. Whether I will stand for election again next year will be a matter for serious consideration - if I don't though, I will give anyone else coming forward a much better idea of what the position involves, and how totally lonely it is!  I admit to crying yesterday because I was completely overwhelmed at the feeling of responsibility I had for the children and staff at the school, and the feeling that the knowledge I had been given imposed a duty of care on me that meant I had to act.  I was relieved in a way to get to gymnastics yesterday afternoon so that I had to focus on something else.The EFG is not here this morning.  She went home from school last night with a friend for a sleepover and they are going to the cinema this afternoon, so I will be picking her up from the friend's house tonight.  We realised that this is the EFG's first real sleepover at someone else's house - the YFG has been on loads, but the EFG had only been to my sister's before!  I am not worried about her - she's nearly 15 - but it is strange here without her and I do miss her!!I made more homemade bread this week, and realised how important the way I lay the dough in the tins is to the final shape of the cooked loaf - if it is uneven, the loaf rises wonky and then goes over in one direction - so I must be more careful to ensure that the loaf is shaped and placed in the tin properly after I have kneaded it.  The bread is OK, but it could have been better!!  The electric slicer works wonders and I have sliced bread in a bag in the bread store just like shop bought.  The FH loves it, the girls are getting used to the crust!  I will be going to Huntingdon this week, so I will be popping over to Ramsey on my way to get some more of the breadmix from Big Brands For Less."},
{"title": "It was OK!", "date": "Thursday 20 January 2011", "text": "I was worried about getting through yesterday - but it was actually OK!  I get bothered sometimes when I have too many commitments in one day, and just the thought of all that yesterday had started to be a problem.....so I got up at 5.45am to get a head-start on it all and make sure I had everything I needed ready, and to be less rushed.I let the chickens out in the dark - some were a bit reluctant to come out of their houses, but they had to come out if they wanted to eat, and by the time I let the last group out, it was almost light.  The girls and I left here at 8.15am for the short trip to the town to the school, overtaking their bus before we left the village, and ensuring that the EFG was at school well before the time for her exam.  I came home again by a rather circuitous route to get through the early traffic of people heading to work.  Home to my breakfast - three sausages which set me up nicely for the day! I was at the school for the meeting at 10am - and I left that meeting, which was completed bar the chitchat, at 11.30am so I had time to come home and have a quick drink before going off to Cambridge.  The trip to Cambridge didn't take long at all - not as long as I had allowed, which is always good - so since there was plenty of tea and coffee and sandwiches available at the venue, I took the opportunity to sit and chat with the other people at my table.  They were an interesting bunch - from all over Cambridgeshire - East Chesterton in the city, Stretham in the East of the county, Wyton-on-the-Hill near Huntingdon, Huntingdon itself, and Bar Hill - a purpose built settlement built 42 years ago.  Family history - my great-grandfather owned some of the fields upon which Bar Hill was built!  Four women, two men and a mix of ages and experience, so it was a good mix, and I hope that we all sit together at the second session in a few weeks time.The evening meeting went OK but I have decided to resign from that committee as it is dominated by one woman - and she insulted our gymnastics club last night quite rudely so I have had enough of her.  If one volunteers for something, you can do without that sort of behaviour - and the woman isn't even the chair of the committee - that person seems to sit back and let this woman take charge.  Last night I tried to ignore her and address my comments to the chair.  I do feel that I would like to tell the chair how I feel about the insult last night so I have to ask someone where she lives or where I can find her phone number!!And eventually, I sat down with my tea, returned a couple of phone calls and emails and fell into bed!  I had to bribe the EFG to go and shut the hens up for me as I was too tired to get changed into outside gear  - so I am on rabbit feeding duty today for her.And so today - the FH is going to the surgery for acupuncture for pain relief regarding his gout at 11.30am, I have the afterschool gym club to run, and then the YFG has a cornet lesson at 6.30pm with the musical director of the band.  This is a one-off lesson because the band practise on Monday night was so busy with more beginners that she didn't get a decent play at all, and came home with a slip of paper asking me to ring the MD.   I will have to go and find her house in daylight when the FH is at the surgery because she warned me that it is very tucked away in a cul-de-sac so I don't fancy trying to find it in the dark!"},

Why is the week mad?  There is stuff happening at the school, so I had a meeting there on Monday (all morning), one today (10am for ?hours), and another one on Friday morning.....add in to that still doing gymnastics, the EFG wanting me to take her to school this morning because she has a GCSE Physics exam (good luck!) and I have also got to go to Cambridge for a governor training session today (1.30 - 6pm) and I have been trying to cook ahead for the times I am not here, as the FH's gout is bothering him again so he is resting most of the time.  Monday night I cooked  mince for spag bol last night, and yesterday I made a lamb-shank casserole to have tonight.  I will be at home tomorrow night, thank goodness.........I am also having challenges making decent bread with the BB4L breadmix that I bought a couple of weeks ago.  After several less than successful breadmachine attempts, I made a double batch yesterday in the Kenwood with the dough hook, let it rise, punched it down and put it in two loaf pans, and it rose again - cooked it in the oven and managed to produce two loaves I could be proud of.  Duly sliced and frozen now.  So relieved to have found a simple way of making bread, and I hope to be able to do it a couple of times a week to produce all our own bread.  I can see that if I can do that, I will have to get more breadmix..........I am also going to try using the granary mix later in the week and see what the family think to that.Better go - things to do!"},

But I think it has been a good one, because I get the feeling that I have done and accomplished a fair deal today, so I can go to bed tonight with a sense of earned tiredness, not the tiredness that comes from sitting around, watching tv or being bored!!I was up early at 6.30am and had a couple of loads of washing done before I took the YFG and went to gym.  I led the preschool group at 9.30 - there were only 6 kids there: we are a little concerned about what happened to the other 7 that were meant to be there, so their parents will be getting a phone call this week from the Head Coach to see whether they are coming back this term.  We need 10 children in order to make the class viable.  The 10.30 class was a little late getting started as people seemed to arrive in dribs and drabs over a 15 minute period, but once we got underway, we really worked the children and had a good session. After gym, I had to sit and have a cuppa and a spot of lunch before heading out to the chook houses for a massive cleaning session.  8 of the 10 pens got cleaned before it got to the stage where the chooks were needing to go inside, so I couldn't be cleaning them out - so 2 left to finish tomorrow, if the weather is OK.  A shower was definitely on the agenda after that, and then I was sous-chef to the YFG as she cooked a savoury rice dish for the supper.........a night off for me, really, but I was left with the washing up. This evening, I have pottered around, taking down dry washing and hanging up more of the wet stuff, and rebooting the washing machine with more.  Last load of the day is still in there. The FH has spent another day in bed, but he feels that his foot is improving a little, so I am hoping that he might get up tomorrow - he will have barnacles on his bum soon if he doesn't get up for at least the afternoon tomorrow.  We may not go to chapel in the morning, as I am quite tired and him being out of action still means that I have everything to do and so to go to chapel would mean me getting up at about 6.30 yet again - the spirit is willing, but the flesh needs its sleep!!  Suppose I had better head off to bed now, and then if I wake up early enough, we could go......"},

{"title": "Very much approved!", "date": "Thursday 13 January 2011", "text": "Thanks to the lovely people at the Frugaldom forums, I found out about the shop in Ramsey which the FH and I visited last week.  I also found out about Approved Food: this is a website selling short dated/out-of-date food - but only food that is past its Best Before date so it is all perfectly usable, and not at all dangerous to eat.I placed an order with AF last Saturday, and it was here, delivered by a courier service, on Tuesday afternoon.  I received an email to say that the parcel had been dispatched, and then, on Tuesday morning, a text message to say that it would be delivered within a particular hour slot.The parcel was very well packed, and all these goodies were tucked inside.  Not everything is actually past its Best Before date - the Crosse & Blackwell savoury rice is in date until December 2011!  And how would Tesco's cleaning liquid pass a Best Before date?A few examples of serious bargains are: James Martin lemon tart mixes - should be £2.49 each, on sale at £1.99 for FIVE! Sainsbury's cuppa soup - a pack of nine boxes, each containing 4 servings - one pound the lot! The delivery charges are very reasonable - £5.25 to most places for the first box, containing up to 29kg, and then £3.75 for each additional box.  The website very handily calculates the weight of the order as you put the items in the virtual trolley, so you know when you are coming to filling a box, and can either decide to stop, or fill another.  I have already talked to a neighbour about a joint order to save postage.  The website offers change as the supplies change, so it will be one to keep an eye on!And all these items in the photos?  £33.odd including the delivery charge!!"},
{"title": "Baking mad", "date": "Monday 10 January 2011", "text": "I felt that I hadn't been at home at all today: I was at school for a meeting between 10 and 1, pottered about at home until 2.45 and then nipped off to town to Tesco and the DIY shop for 90 minutes.  Today didn't start off terribly well - the FH had a fall as he was getting out of the shower this morning; I was relieved that I was in the house when it happened as I was able to go to him and help him to get up.  He was rather shocked, and got back into bed for the time that I was out this morning.  He didn't feel up to doing much and it seemed more sensible to sit in bed and watch some tv and snooze, tucked up in the warm, rather than sit downstairs and have to light the fire or be cold!  We looked at the shower and decided that it would be a good thing to replace the shower enclosure as this is not the first time he has fallen in this way.  The trouble is that the enclosure opens on the corner so that you have to get in on the diagonal and there is nothing to hold onto.  If we put in a fully opening door at one side, he can have a grab rail on the wall so that he has something to hold onto whilst he is stepping out.  I went to the DIY store to look into the shower options whilst I was out - there is a huge range in price!After my trip out, I had a couple of hours in the kitchen and made good use of the oven: mincemeat muffins, two loaves of white bread, a cherry pie and a jam turnover, toad in the hole for tea and a banana cake.  I bought some \"reduced\" veg at Tesco - and got quite a lot of broccoli, so I took one head of broccoli round to my friend D. Whilst I was there I saw some manky bananas that she was going to throw out, so she asked me if I wanted them!!  Of course!!  So I managed to swap the broccoli for two bananas just perfect for cake.  Tonight the FH and the YFG have been to band practise.  The EFG has had a night off as she is taking a GCSE Biology exam on Thursday, and then one in Physics next week - she is working hard on her revision and didn't want to get distracted from all that."},

We've been here 6 years and this is the first time we have had mice in the kitchen, so I am rather bewildered as to how they got in.

The noises under one of the cupboards have stopped today, but the YFG has seen another lurking behind the fridge.....the saga will continue.This morning my friend D popped round to make arrangements for us to collect her children from school later in the month whilst she nips off to hospital.  The FH will actually have to do the collecting that day as I will be in Cambridge on a governor course.  They are lovely children and he won't mind - he has agreed.  D stayed for a while, and then the chap came for the Astra so I had to say a sad goodbye to the car - end of an era there and lots of happy memories of trips around the countryside in that car.  After lunch, the FH and I went to Ramsey.  On the Frugaldom website, I had read about a website called Big Brands For Less and people were talking about some breadmixes which work and are very cheap.  I found them on the website and then discovered that there is actually a shop and it isn't more than 45 minutes away.  Since it was a very dreary afternoon, we thought we'd go over there and see what else was on offer.  The shop was very small but well packed, and we found the breadmixes easily (3.5kg for £1 - just add water) so bought those and some other bits and bobs like rice pud and Jelly Bean (2 tubes for £1) as a treat for the girls.  Ramsey has another claim to fame, apparently: the world's first carbon neutral supermarket.  Tesco has built an eco-store there, which aims to generate more energy that it uses, uses rainwater to flush the loos, natural daylight, LED-lights in the car park, and a timber framed building - it was refreshingly different from the average run-of-the-mill Tesco.  All the refridgerated food was in cabinets with sliding doors rather than open as well.  I was sort of impressed, but I wouldn't travel that far to patronise it very often - and I notice that there was already a good sized Co-operative store in the town so I wonder about the necessity of a Tesco adding to the town.Yesterday, the chooks managed to lay an egg between them!  I am not sure which hen laid the egg, but it was a layer (ie one who was laying before, not a pullet) in the group of older hens.  I was so excited to find it that I rushed up to the house to show the FH!!"},

Thankfully, the mouse poo evidence is not spread out too far so their movements have been relatively limited, which is a great relief.  We have purchased four good mousetraps today, and a neighbour has lent us three more, so that makes 9 altogether - not quite enough for that great scene in \"Mousehunt\" where there are hundreds of traps all going off at once, but certainly enough to have a good go! My Astra has been sold tonight - for the grand sum of £70....which is just about what the scrap man would have given me for it.  And it will still be seen around the place, as the chap who is buying it is connected with the feedshop where I get my chook food, so I'll still see it occasionally.

Well, the mouse ate it all up and almost left a tip - the little darling ate the lot off both traps and didn't get caught - again!!BUT this evening, halfway through dinner when I was taking plates back to the kitchen, there he was again - scuttling along the counter and behind the bread machine........eeeeeeeeeeeekkkk!  So the FH had a mighty fine idea and sent the EFG for equipment.  I moved as much stuff out of the way whilst he set up this very specialised bit of kit - and then it was war.He hoovered the mouse up the pipe, and promptly stuffed several plastic bags down the end of the pipe.  Job almost done!!  We just have to get the mouse out of the hoover now.....a job we will definitely be doing Outside.Of course, we can't be sure that that was the only mouse, so we will be taking precautions and setting traps again tonight - if the food gets eaten, we at least know we have more company, even if we can't catch them with the silly traps.What hysterical laughter you would have heard here tonight!!!I am sitting here with a daft grin on my face because I have two more followers - welcome Frugaldom and Rainbowchild!!"},

There are surfaces that have had decorations on for three weeks that must be harbouring spiders - and talking of wee beasties - we have a mouse!  I saw one in the utility room late yesterday afternoon, so we set two traps last night and the cheeky beggar ate the chocolate fudge off both of them and lived!

I decided to go north to a discount shop where I knew I would be able to buy a 5l plastic container with a lid to go in the fridge.  Round trip would take about an hour, with a stop on the way home to fill up with the cheapest petrol I could scout on the way up there (price rises due here).  All went well.  Purchase made and heading home.  Approached Tesco where I believed the cheapest petrol to be, and the YFG said that she Needed some stuff for lunchboxes, so we had to go into the store as well as the petrol station.  OK, I said, you go get what you need, I need the loo, so I'll meet you back here near the flowers in a minute.I'm in the loo, and I suddenly for no reason decide to check my phone, where I find a text from the EFG - \"Um.  Dad having a crisis\" OMG!!!!!!!! Half an hour ago!!!  What kind of crisis? I text back pronto. No reply.  He's had a heart attack, he's gone to hospital in an ambulance, he's ..........I don't know what I didn't think........I rang the house - no answer - my mind was whirling.  I got out of the loo and headed for the rendezvous with the YFG - who then approached me from behind and scared me to death. I rang the house again - and HE answered.  \"What's the matter? Are you OK? What's happening?\" \"Oh - the kitchen floor is covered in water - the dishwasher leaked!\"\"Is that ALL? I can cope with that!\" Water on the floor - nothing, not a problem, I don't care.  That is nothing in the grand scheme of things, my love, when I was imagining you dying.

How far should we plan?  Just for the month ahead, for the year, or for a few years hence?  And what of other people and their plans?  I am spending time today and tomorrow thinking about what I want to achieve in 2011 for myself and for our family; I also need to consider what responsibilities I have to the family in terms of time and money to provide them with all the things they need.  I have been poking around the forums at the Frugaldom website and learned a lot about challenges and generating income.  It is fascinating, and I am really keen to incorporate some of the ideas into our plans.  It is kind of hard to work on plans here, as the FH doesn't have any - he is 73 now and happy to go from one day to the next, with his weekly highlights a regular feature, and he helps me with a lot of stuff, but that is usually driven by me (that means I nag!).  The girls plan their homework, their tv viewing, and their time with their friends - the rest of the time their time is pretty well directed at school, gym, Brownies, chapel, etc, or I am giving them chores to do!!  That means that all the long-range planning is down to me, and they all get a little say but not a lot....I will post tomorrow when I have finished some of the plans, and hope to be able to share some of what we want to achieve in 2011.2011 has arrived, and we have no idea what the year will bring, really!  According to the news, it is going to be an \"austerity\" year, but I think that there will be a lot more going on than everyone being hard up!!

The EFG helped my cousin's husband to get some CDs of music downloaded onto his MP3 player and he was amazed at how quickly she was able to do it for him on our laptop.  My aunt and uncle were there, so there was much reminiscing of the good old days of my grandmother and her family - it was all good fun, and we really enjoyed seeing them all again.The YFG wanted to go to Asda to see if they had Just Dance 2 for the Wii, as she had earmarked some of her Christmas money for that.  Sure enough, although Tesco and Sainsbury's had failed to provide it for us yesterday, Asda came through today and she scored one!  Once we got home tonight, she and the EFG played on it for a good hour, entertaining the FH - and then had a rest and watched a DVD before having another go - they are having more exercise today than they have had all week.......Thanks to silversewer, I have found a new website all about saving money and having a good life: it is called Frugaldom - and it is fab!!  Check it out - and I have also found a couple more blogs to add to my blog roll so I am sure you would be very welcome to have a browse there too.Yesterday I did take the girls out.  We were all getting a bit of cabin fever, and wanted to see the world again, if only for an hour or two!  I didn't, however, take them to the cinema, as they weren't up early enough.  I was busying myself around the house, washing and tidying things, and was quite happy to carry on, so since they couldn't get themselves up on time, we didn't go.  We will go one day, though!  We went out at 2.30 and were home by 5pm - we only went to the town, with the primary ambition on having a scout for some shoes for the EFG.  Several shops didn't have any she liked, so we had a look in Tesco - and came out with my purse considerably lighter.I bought them a pair of trousers each, several pairs of socks, a belt for the YFG, and then I stocked up on toiletries on offer, and some washing liquid I like.  With the VAT rise coming in January, I know that these things are going to go up a little, so since I had the money available, I bought them now to save a few pennies.  I am not daft - I know that I have only saved the pennies but it is as they say - \"Look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves\" - and so those things are now stashed around the house, and we won't have to think about buying them for about six months!!  Thinking ahead, I did as I always do and bought next year's Christmas crackers from the reduced stand as well as several packets of half-price Christmas cards - I had run out this year and had to buy a couple of packets at full price, and that hurt!  I am prepared for 2011 now!  I also bought a very nice mug for a friend's present next year - she loves blue and white crockery and it is from a range from the Victoria & Albert Museum - she will love it!! So, today.  We are heading out at about 11am to go up to Lincolnshire to my cousin's for lunch.  My aunt and uncle will be there too, so it will be lovely to spend some time with them and catch up on all their news.  I haven't seen my aunt and uncle since August Bank Holiday, so it has been a couple of months, although my cousin did pop down to see us a month or so back.  My cousin is starting a new business venture this year, which is quite exciting, so there will be lots to talk about, and the YFG is very interested in her dogs, so there will probably be a walk on the agenda too.  The YFG is hoping to call in at an Asda on the way to see if they have a Wii game that she wants to spend some of her Christmas money on - Just Dance 2 - so time for that will have to be factored into the day as well."},

Tonight I have had a jacket potato with some salmon and the rest of the gang have had tuna pasta bake - an excellent storecupboard day of cooking and eating.  The girls are straining at the leash to get to the shops and were almost begging us to take them out this afternoon - so we sent them out for a walk for half an hour.  Fresh air and exercise were good for them, but they came home very cold!!  The FH has been doing the Christmas puzzle a lot today, and has just got a few more pieces to drop in - he has made good progress today!  The picture is really coming together at last.  He says it feels like there aren't enough pieces left, but it should turn out OK in the end....My sister is feeling a little better today, but still feels very rough.  Hopefully she will be able to rest and recuperate for the rest of the week; if I am in the town, I will pop in to see her.Tomorrow, we may go to see the latest Harry Potter film as I have some Tesco Cineworld vouchers.  The trouble is that there have been several new films advertised on the tv this week, and now we want to see them all - some will just have to wait until they come on the tv.  The other trip this week will be for some new school shoes for the EFG.  We might go to Downham Market for those, as there is an excellent shop there for wide-fitting shoes.  That means I can pop into Morrison's for some of their lovely meat!Hope that your Christmas has brought you lots of fun, and festive cheer!"},
{"title": "Peace reigns tonight", "date": "Saturday 25 December 2010", "text": "The FH is watching the news, the EFG is reading, the YFG is playing her new Professor Leyton game on her Nintendo DS, UJ is doing the Christmas puzzle - so I have slipped away for a moment or two!My sister rang me this morning at 9am; the first thing I said was, \"Happy Christmas!\" and then, \"You alright?\"  Well, no, she wasn't OK - she's come down with the flu and had woken at 6am absolutely drenched, and with a temperature.  UJ was planning to go to her house today and then stay the night and come to us for the day tomorrow, so we had to ring him and get him to come here for the whole weekend instead - good job there was plenty of food!  He is always very welcome here, but it meant a little tidying and bedmaking in the spare room this afternoon.  The girls helped out so we got it done quickly.We started off the day's festivities at chapel, which was a fun service - all the children got a present, and we played pass the parcel as part of the sermon as well.  We are a small congregation, and we sit around on chairs in a horseshoe shape so it is a very informal situation.  It was a lovely service, and some of the children had written their own version of the Christmas story, interspersed with appropriate songs - it was great!UJ arrived after that, and the smells from the kitchen were beginning to be tempting!!  The lunch was ready at about 1.30pm - leek and potato soup, the turkey course and then the pudding.  We were all relaxing afterwards - the FH and UJ had to have a snooze! It has been a lovely day which we have enjoyed.  We rang our friend George, in his eighties, whom we spent a lot of time with when we lived in Scotland, and I called my sister for an update on her health (same as this morning, although she has spent most of the day asleep).  The girls are thinking about heading for bed now - and I don't think I will be far behind them!"},

I have also been out delivering a couple of gifts in the village, and to friends here on the estate, where I stopped for a cup of tea as well. Now I am going to give the chooks their afternoon feed before I ice the cake and do some baking.  Hope you all have everything under control where you are!!"},
{"title": "Mince pies and more", "date": "Thursday 23 December 2010", "text": "The pastry I made last night from the Delia recipe worked well - except that the FH didn't know I could make puff pastry and ridiculed it as \"bought\" stuff, saying that it was not as good as my home made pastry - I think that was a back-handed compliment.  Anyway, once he had been educated, he thought it was nice!  I have put some more butter in the freezer tonight to make some more puff pastry tomorrow for sausage rolls and coconut tarts - my dad loves coconut tarts and he will be here on Boxing Day so they are for him. Today's mince pies have been delivered to various destinations - most are in a tin in the kitchen, ready for the family and visitors to enjoy; some were delivered today to the Head Coach from gym, who loves a good mince pie - and for the man who has everything, something for his stomach is a safe bet when you can't think what to get him for Christmas! We also took a small parcel with us when we went to stock up on chicken food - the chaps at the shop are very kind about loading the car up for me, so that was a little treat for them - they also got a little box of home-made fudge.  Two bags of pies are also tucked away in the freezer for later on in the festive season!The YFG returned home from a sleepover at lunchtime, and then she accompanied me around and about as I finished up all the last minute pick ups and deliveries.  We visited my sister to drop off her gifts and pick up her gifts for the girls, and we had to go to the shop as the FH complained because I hadn't bought any lemonade...a man of simple pleasures!!So, what will tomorrow bring?  Probably no more snow at the moment - but some more baking is on the agenda as well as some last minute cleaning chores like washing the kitchen floor as there is no point doing that until the baking is finished.  The turkey came out of the freezer this morning, and I will be preparing as much as I can tomorrow - the veg, the brandy butter, the stuffing balls - and putting the icing on the cake!  The presents are all wrapped, the cards posted and delivered........tomorrow evening I will be looking forward to putting my feet up!"},

I'm then going to put it in the fridge and make the mince pies in the morning.  Today has been a busy one - cleaning more chook houses out, moving some GPOs to a new pen in the big shed, taking the YFG to her sleepover at a friend's house in the village, cooking tea with the FH and watching a little TV.Hoping all your Christmas preparations are underway, that you are all keeping warm, and sending everyone best wishes for a peaceful Christmas.The tree is in the sitting room, in the bay window.  The girls got it decorated on Saturday and it looks very festive - especially as I try to keep it to red, green and gold, although I notice that a few other colours have begun to sneak in!!"},
{"title": "Ups and downs today", "date": "Monday 20 December 2010", "text": "Today's been good, but it has been a bit thoughtful and reflective as well.  The FH took the girls to Cambridge this morning so that the YFG could have her orthodontic braces put on.  Given that the roads were bad, and the weather looking dicey, they allowed two hours for a journey which could be done in 45 minutes in good weather and light traffic. Whilst they were gone, I pottered around in the house for a while, and the post arrived.  In the post came a card from a family we know in Scotland.  The mum in the family is a girl I knew from university at St Andrews - we had rooms on the same corridor for our first year in a Hall of Residence, and she is Catholic, and so is my best friend from those days, so they spent time together as well.  When we sold our first house to move along the road, she and her husband bought it - it was a huge surprise when they came to look around.  We knew each other, but we weren't really friends - we didn't have a lot in common back then as I was studying theology and she was doing maths or science.  So we lived in the same street for a couple of years, and I had the EFG and then the YFG and she had two boys over time.  We have kept in touch, via Christmas cards and letters - and it was her card and letter which touched me so much today.  Her fourth child was born in April - a little sister for the three boys - and she has Down's Syndrome, and had to undergo some quite traumatic surgery early on in her life to close a hole in her heart.  Little BT sounds like quite a fighter, and the photo included in the letter shows three adoring older brothers holding her for the post, so she is very well loved.  I can't be there for them because I am so far away, but I can remember BT and her family in my prayers.  If you are of a praying mind, I'd be glad if you would think of them too.I had a bath, and then wrapped up in many layers and stepped outside.  I quite honestly have not been outside a door in two weeks, so I just mooched around the garden for a while, and then had a look at the chooks.  The FH has done his best to look after them, but they were in sore need of cleaning out, so I did that for an hour and a half, and they were very grateful!  I also gave them some hot mash to warm them up.  I found a couple of dead chickens as well, which was sad - one very freshly dead in the run which must have just died in the past couple of hours since the FH let them out and fed them in the morning.  It is likely to have died because of the cold weather.  I also found our beloved Lana - she was a beautiful little bantam, who must have been quite an age - about 5 or 6 we think.  She probably died last night, as I found her body in the shed where she had gone in to roost.  She and her sister Leah had free run of the garden so Leah is looking a bit lonely today.  We were all a bit sad about Lana as she had been a very favourite chook for years, and we will miss her mooching about the garden, but she had had a very happy life, raised a good number of foster-chicks, and been a good mum.  RIP Lana.The girls and the FH arrived home at about 2.30pm and within an hour the FH was off again to help a friend with a leaking sink!  The girls and I enjoyed a visit from a friend and her daughter whilst he was out - I hadn't had a chance for a good chat with B for nearly two months, so we all sat round the fire with a cup of tea each and caught up on the news.This evening, my delivery from Sainsbury's has arrived, and I have scored a free turkey!  I ordered a turkey crown, which would serve 8-10 people, and some packs of chicken thighs on offer at 3 for £5.  These items didn't quite make it here - although the rest of the delivery was great.  I phoned up to complain about the chicken thighs as I got substitutions which cost me £11.08 - I don't mind some subs but that was taking the p!  And the turkey crown had become a full turkey but one which only served 4-6 people.  I phoned - and had to wait 35 minutes to speak to someone so I was pleased that it was a free phone number - to complain about the way the subs are done; surely they would be able to see that I needed a bigger turkey if the one I had actually ordered would feed that many people, and as for the chicken, well!  If something is on offer at £5, you don't expect to have to pay more than twice that for the sub, do you?!?  So the lady very kindly offered me a full refund for the turkey, and refunded the difference between the offer price and what I paid for the chicken.  It does pay to moan occasionally, although I wouldn't make a habit of it.  Perhaps they will sub more thoughtfully in future.....The YFG is now having some pain in her teeth, so she has had some Calpol, and some rice pudding - her back teeth can't meet, she says, so she can't chew at all.  That could be tricky, so I am going to phone up for advice in the morning.  If anyone has advice from their own experience, I'd be glad to read it!"},
{"title": "Getting there...", "date": "Saturday 18 December 2010", "text": "The girls and I have been sorting out the sitting room today, rearranging the furniture and putting up the decorations.  The tree is up - at last - and the girls are satisfied with our efforts.  We have to move things around to accommodate the tree, and an extra table for the Christmas jigsaw - it is usually a 1000 piece job, so it demands a table of its own, ideal for pottering over it and popping the odd piece in now and again when you have a spare moment to sit down.  We actually have two to do this year, as it got overlooked last year!The most gorgeous smell is emanating from the kitchen tonight as I have a chicken in the slow cooker, along with some onion, celery and parsnip - it might make tomorrow's lunch as a pie once it is cooked.Now that the tree is up, cards are posted and we are in the mood, I am beginning to get into the swing of this - the marzipanning of the cake is on the plan for tomorrow.The FH is feeling fragile tonight as he fell over this morning - well, he fell off a ladder in the garage when he was putting some books back on the shelves.  He had a little wooden stepladder, which broke, so now it just consists of the ladder part without the supporting leg and rather than mending it, he has been leaning it against the shelves.  Today it slipped and he ended up on his back on the floor, and he has scraped his leg and his elbow, and feels a little shaken up!  He is now in the bath and having an early night.We were delighted to watch the final of Strictly Come Dancing tonight - we voted for Matt Baker, but Kara was a deserving winner.  I wouldn't have been surprised if Pamela Stephenson had won as she was also excellent and her show dance was the best - the other two were really a lot of posturing and not a lot of dancing!!A very generous friend of the FH has given us LOADS of DVDs this weekend - probably nearly 200 of them!!  This friend's father has had to go into a residential home and can't take them all along, so the friend has been tasked with getting rid of them - and the FH was in seventh heaven looking through them all as there are a lot of action films which he loves.  They are all in excellent condition - he was delighted to find a DVD of Andre Rieu and his Johann Strauss orchestra playing in Australia, so that kept him amused for over two hours last night as he was completely taken with the music.  There are more Steven Seagal films, Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, Bruce Willis, the Bourne Trilogy, Delta Force, etc - lots for him to enjoy!"},
{"title": "I'm not ready........", "date": "Thursday 16 December 2010", "text": "Nearly a week has past since I have last blogged here - sorry!  I've been doing a lot of thinking (uh, oh!) and realised that my illness has largely been down to stress rather than a bug.  I've had time to think, time to relax  and let my mind wander - all that knitting is really rather meditative.  So, on Tuesday, I got up and decided to attack the thing which has caused me the most stress - the school governor situation.I made some phone calls, I am sure I have made a little stir, and things are happening.  Most importantly, I am getting the professional support I need from various agencies in order to help the school to progress.  And I feel better - I have spread the load.  I have a mentor assigned to me as a new Chair, so I bent her ear as well, and she reassures me that I am doing OK, and reminded me that actually, we do this job as volunteers, for nothing, and should be treated with some respect, not as dogsbodies!  So that helped, too.I have also been plodding around the house - not in a despondent kind of mood, but in terms of doing one thing at a time and not thinking of the next 10 things I need to do!!  Taking my time, sitting and reading a book near the fire for an hour if I feel like it, knitting a spell, hanging the washing up and then doing something I enjoy for a while.  So if People have rung to ask how I am, I have said, \"Plodding along!\" and felt quite happy about it.But, I am not ready for Christmas - the cake has not been draped in marzipan, the tree is not up, the lounge is not cleaned, the parcels have yet to be posted.......but so what?  I still have a week!!  I'll keep at it a little at a time and it will be done, eventually.  I have done some things - ordered oil for the heating, the ironing, sent the Christmas cards to the post, sent some messages to friends.  We are warm, dry and well fed - and together - and that is what matters!"},
{"title": "Bugs and burst pipes!", "date": "Friday 10 December 2010", "text": "I have been suffering with a stomach bug now for just over a week, so I am not doing much at all.  I am very pleased with how independent and mature the girls have proved to be, as they are managing to get themselves out of the house in the morning to go to school with no input from me - they are making their lunches and their breakfast.  They go out of the house looking smart and shout out, \"Love you!\" as they go.  The FH has had to take over the care of the chooks, which has been challenging for him, but they are all doing OK.  They will get cleaned out next week when I am better.  The burst pipe seems to have happened last night - in the workshop this morning the FH found about an inch of water all over the floor.  The pipe to the water heater over the hand basin is the one which burst, so that is a lesson learned.  For now, he has turned the water off at the stopcock in there and will sort it out when it is a little warmer.  So, this episode of illness has taught me that I am not indispensible, and that things go on - we have had to put plans in place for the YFG to lead the preschool session at gym tomorrow morning, and a Songs of Praise tomorrow evening at chapel will go ahead anyway, of course - I have planned the service, put it together, arranged the readings and the participants, but the FH and the girls will actually lead the service for me.   It has also meant that I have had a bit of time for rest and recuperation!  I have read a few books, watched some tv, done some knitting etc and generally had a rest - although I have been a little bored at times - I am definitely looking forward to getting better and being able to take part in the preparations for Christmas.  I have done an internet shop at Sainsbury's to be delivered on the 20th, so I hope that the weather doesn't deteriorate and prevent that happening!Hope everyone else is OK!"},
{"title": "Do we really need this?", "date": "Monday 6 December 2010", "text": "I have just received my latest Tesco vouchers through, just in time for Christmas, they say!  I was really surprised that over the whole Christmas and New Year period, the local Tesco will only actually be closed on Christmas Day....it will be open Boxing Day and New Year's Day, albeit on a slightly reduced opening hour system, but it is still open for business.  Is it that the supermarkets are so desperate for our business, or is it consumer-driven?  Who will really be wanting to trawl the aisles on Boxing Day?  Not me."},
{"title": "It has begun.......", "date": "Sunday 5 December 2010", "text": "The flashing lights are up in the cul-de-sac we live in - the neighbours have started to decorate their houses for Christmas.  I always think of Advent as a little but like Lent - a time of waiting before the big festival that is Christmas or Easter.  My thoughts on the period are that we should be a little bit austere in our tastes at this time so that we can more fully appreciate the celebrations.  Our Christmas tree goes up the Saturday before Christmas, so that'll be on the 18th this year, but there are already Christmas trees aplenty adorning front windows everywhere.  It seems to me that \"Christmas\" has become a season, much like Autumn, and has to be stretched out over a huge period - a little of November, all of December and some of January! I much prefer to think of the Twelve Days of Christmas, beginning on the day itself and ending a few days after New Year in January.  That is enough for me - and I am not being miserable, but more realistic!  Children get so excited these days about things that it seems silly to keep them hyped up for weeks on end, building up their expectations.  At the other end of the spectrum, a friend of mine let her children believe for years that Father Christmas brought all their decorations on Christmas Eve, so she and her husband decorated the house after they had gone to bed that night - inspired woman!In the middle of all the decorations and gift giving, the matter of the babe in the manger often gets overlooked.  That is really what it is all about, and we, as a Christian family, will be doing all we can to keep that at the centre of our celebrations."},
{"title": "Big skies", "date": "Saturday 4 December 2010", "text": "We get an awful lot of these swans going over at this time of year; they come to the wetland reserve in the Fens for the winter.  Each day they fly out onto the fields to feed, and then return to the reserve in the late afternoon for their evening feeding session, honking like mad as they fly!  I wish I had been able to take a photo like this one, but this came off the internet - I never have my camera with me when they fly over, and more often than not, the light wouldn't be good enough for me to take a picture anyway.I had heard people talk about the big skies out here in the Fens but it had passed me by.  I hadn't really noticed as I suppose I had got used to them, and then we went on holiday to Scotland and all of a sudden there was Less sky, because the ground rises up to meet the sky so dramatically up there.  When we got back, it hit me quite suddenly one afternoon when I was driving home with the family - the FH was driving and I was gazing around me like a loon - I could see sky in every direction for miles and there seemed to be absolute acres of it!!  And I realised then what people had been talking about..."},
{"title": "Getting used to it now", "date": "Friday 3 December 2010", "text": "We've had a week and a half of this weather now, and the forecasters today have mentioned that it may be the New Year before this cold snap passes, so if we aren't used to it, we may as well get used to it soon!!  I have adapted my habits with the chickens - I soon got fed up of breaking ice in the waterers each morning, so when I shut the hens up at 4pm now, I empty all the waterers and load them up into the wheelbarrow to bring them up near the house, ready to fill in the utility room each morning.  The chooks are loving the hot mash, so I will continue with that, too.It has been the end of an era here today: my beloved Vauxhall Astra estate car (1.7TD) (red) (N reg) has been replaced.  We got it as a family car back in 1997, I believe; we certainly had it in January 1998, but the details get blurred so far back.  We had just the one car back then, but on moving to England and the FH going to work for a year, we had to get a second car; we got a really old banger that I just couldn't get on with, so the Astra became \"mine\" then.  It has never let me down - never broken down when I have been out and about - and been a lovely car to drive all these years.  It was second hand when we bought it through the Network Q programme, and we got just £5 change from £8,000.  We bought it outright, and it has served us well.  I am not sure what I am going to do with it now - the windscreen wipers only work on full, the headlights come on when you indicate, the steering is getting a little shaky - so it was time to retire it.  RIP Red.  It is on the driveway now that the insurance has been transferred to the new Vectra, but I know that there will be a little tear in my eye when it finally leaves us.  Soppy, I know!I had a big baking session last night as the lunchbox supplies were getting low, there were no biscuits, and the natives were feeling hungry because there was nothing to snack on!  So I made some iced finger buns, some cupcakes, some peanut butter biscuits and some Viennese biscuits which still need to be sandwiched together but I hope they will eat the finger buns first as they are a dough recipe and will dry out before anything else........Speaking of dough, the charming Paul Hollywood who appeared on the Great British Bake-off, wrote a book back in 2004 called \"100 Great Breads\".  I thought I'd like a copy so I started looking around the internet for one.  Well, talk about rare as hen's teeth - there is one on eBay for sale at £55 (and it has a bid!!!!!!!), sellers on Amazon are offering them for anything from about £75, and there are a few on abebooks.com but they are ridiculously priced as well.  I have put in a request at the local library for one, but there are none in the county and so it will have to be brought in from elsewhere, if there is one to be had in the country!  The £5 I will have to pay if they find one will be well worth it........and there will be a lot of recipes copied out of it if it turns up, I can tell you!!  Obviously high time Mr Hollywood turned his attention back to writing books.The stock cupboard is looking a bit bare in places, but nothing too bad.  We bought some eggs in the village yesterday for the baking, and some leeks which I soon turned into leek and potato soup.  The FH bought some bread from the Co-op in town when he went to pick the girls up from art club at 5pm, and there isn't really any need to worry about anything else until next week sometime.  Snow is very good for the bank balance in terms of grocery shopping, in my case.  I have been tempted to look into an online order from a supermarket, but I don't want enough at the moment to justify the delivery charge, so I am not indulging.The YFG is supposed to be going on a trip to Warwick Castle next week so I will have to contact the school early next week to see what they think about the likelihood of that going ahead.I must take some snow scene photos one of these days!!"},

However, we don't have snow up to the windowsills, we do have plenty of wood for the fire, food to feed the family and the animals, oil for the boiler, gas for the cooker, and electricity - at the moment.  I must admit that the electricity flickered on and off about three times yesterday, so that is always a bit flaky out here in the sticks in this weather, but that is why I insisted on a gas hob when I moved out here!  One of the neighbours commented only yesterday that we were probably the best prepared people she knew, what with the gas hob and the woodburner.  She lives in an all-electric house, so she will be bringing her family round here in an extended power cut - she knows that they are very welcome!"},

The wind this morning was icy cold, though, and the girls wrapped up warm for their journey to school.  I bundled myself up in many, many layers to go outside to deal with the chooks - it is taking me about an hour now in the mornings, so I need to be warm!  I had 6 layers on my top half, a pair of leggings and a pair of tights on the bottom half under the tracksuit bottoms, and two pairs of socks.  Then there were two scarves and a woolly hat to finish off the ensemble.  I did look rather Michelin-man like!When I came in from that expedition, I spent a couple of hours wrapping Christmas presents!  It was fun, and a great relief to get the bulk of it done.  There are a few things that haven't arrived yet, but they are mostly for the girls.  Now the next development will be organising the posting of some parcels - mostly to the children of the girls' godparents in Scotland, and to a few other children around the countryside.  I generally don't give presents to adults, but I make exceptions for my sister, my uncle and my dad, amongst others.  If there are children in the family, they get the presents.After lunch, I moved the chooks around and spent some time cleaning up out there.  Then I got a little surprise as the new-to-me car I have bought from a local garage in the village was brought round, just to tell me that it has passed its MOT, had new brake pipes fitted and it is ready to go.  I wasn't expecting it so quickly, so I told N that I would have to sort out the money for him and arrange the insurance, and let him know when I would be ready for the car!  One quick phone call to Direct Line and the insurance was set for Friday, and then organising the money was another thing done.  When the girls got home from school, I walked down to the garage with the YFG and we gave N the cheque for the car and let him know about the insurance, so we'll be going back to get it on Friday.  It is a Vauxhall Vectra, 1.8l petrol engine, and it is an 02 plate.  I am happy to be sticking with Vauxhall although I am moving from an Astra to a Vectra, and from diesel to petrol.I made a vegetable stew with cheese dumplings for the family's tea, and then I did some batch cooking to make use of the oven - two Herman fruit cakes and a Herman lemon loaf, a chocolate brownie that I can eat and a lovely apple crumble.  The girls and the FH have tasted the lemon Herman and say it is gorgeous, so that is a relief.  The fruit versions will be going into the freezer when they are cold. We have just watched the tv programme called \"Turn Back Time\" about the high street shops in Shepton Mallet - it is a fascinating programme and I can't wait to see next week's as it will be set in the 1970s - just when I was born."},
{"title": "Snow and more to come", "date": "Monday 29 November 2010", "text": "The girls were eager to look out the windows this morning to see if there was enough snow to warrant a school closure - there wasn't, so they had to go off to the bus stop in the snow, well wrapped up in winter coats, hats, scarves and gloves.  It wasn't good that the bus was late because of the weather and they had to stand at the bus stop for about 20 minutes but in this weather, these things just can't be helped.I dragged the FH to the doctor's this morning about his awful foot problems and it turns out that he probably has gout!  The doctor took some blood to try to get the diagnosis confirmed but also sent us home to make an appointment at the local cottage hospital for an x-ray to rule out any serious damage he might have done.  We went to that appointment this afternoon at 3pm, and were in and out in minutes.  We will have to look at some medication for that, I think, if it is confirmed, in conjunction with the boss at Papworth as some of the medications for gout are contra-indicated for use with his heart meds.  One of the heart anti-rejection drugs could actually be part of the cause of the gout as well, unfortunately.One of the cockerels has been moved tonight into the pen with the basic Heinz varieties laying hens.  I need his pen in the shed for some growers who haven't had the chance to go outside yet, and it is high time they did, so clearing out his pen and moving them over will be on the list for tomorrow.  I will put a piece of glass in the pophole so that they can see out but not actually get out for a day or two, before letting them out properly maybe on Wednesday or Thursday.I do hope everyone is staying warm in this weather.  We have lots of wood for the stove to keep us warm in the lounge, and the cupboards are well stocked too!"},
{"title": "Fudge recipe and more", "date": "Sunday 28 November 2010", "text": "This fudge recipe has come from the Australian Simple Savings website, where a member posted it, saying that she got it from the Family Circle Christmas Special, 2008.  Conscious of copyright issues, I am posting my version of the recipe here, which is ever so slightly different!!So, here goes:1. Grease and line an 8\" square cake tin, making sure that there is a small overhang of greaseproof paper all the way round the tin.2. Put the contents of a 395g tin of sweetened condensed milk in a microwaveable 2 litre Pyrex bowl with 1 cup of soft brown sugar, 125g butter and 2 tbsp liquid glucose (Tesco sell it). Heat uncovered at Medium-High/70% for 6-8 minutes.  Stir it every two minutes with a balloon whisk.  It will start to boil.  When it does, heat for a further 3-4 minutes, stirring every minute with a wooden spoon.  It will thicken, go golden and boil rapidly!3.  Remove from the microwave and put on a heatproof surface - leave for a couple of minutes until the bubbles calm down.4.  Now add 200g good quality dark chocolate, which has been finely chopped.  Stir it in until it has all melted and been incorporated into the fudge.  Make sure that the mixture is smooth.5. Pour the mixture into the tin, smoothing it out and levelling it off.  Leave for 3-4 hours until it has set; it can be put in the fridge when it is cooler.6. To store, it can be wrapped in greaseproof paper and stored in an airtight container in the fridge - it won't need to be stored long!  Cut into small pieces when you are ready to give it as a gift, or to serve it.Suggestions for flavourings - you could add 3/4 cup chopped pistachio nuts and 30ml Bailey's Irish cream liqueur OR use white chocolate and flavour with Cointreau, perhaps.  Next on my list to try is rum flavouring with raisins.  You can also do this basic recipe here with milk chocolate instead of plain - just make up your own variations.I think a small selection of this would make ideal teacher gifts for Christmas, or for those relatives who have everything, need nothing and are a challenge to satisfy at Christmas!!So, back to other things - the weather, for a start........the earliest laying snow for 17 years, extremely cold weather in November, the cold snap predicted to last for two weeks, temperatures falling to minus 17 in Powys last night, more heavy snow predicted........have you checked out ukweathergeek's site which I linked to in a post last week?  He's definitely onto something, and this weather is already bearing out some of his predictions, and it is not even December yet!!The YFG and I travelled to Ipswich yesterday for her gymnastics competition.  UJ, the EFG and my sister also came to watch, and my sister took us all in her car, which was a huge relief to me, not having to drive all that way home after the competition.  The comp itself was eye-opening!  The gymnasts are all supposed to be \"recreational\" which means that they train for no more than 4 hours a week.  All I can say is that I need lessons on how to achieve those kinds of results on that much training - the standard was higher than we had ever competed at before, and we did OK.  There were 24 competitors on each piece, so the YFG coming in the top half at 9th and 10th on some pieces was an achievement.  She worked really hard, gave of her best, competed in the right spirit, and had an enjoyable day.  Our other gymnast in her age group did OK too.  In the other age group, the 12+ group, we had another two girls, and they did extremely well - one got Gold on the Vault and the other managed Silver on the Bars, so we have produced some regional award winners!!  I am so proud of all of them for all the work and effort they put in to training for the original county competition, and then to keep it up and do it all again yesterday - magnificent!The other coach who was there with me from our club was pleased, as I was, to be exposed to that level of competition, and we both felt we had learned a lot.  The even better thing was the chap who tutored me on both my coaching courses was there with some gymnasts from his club, and he was kind enough to come over in the YFG's session when he was in the same group for us on the rotations and could watch our girls, and give me coaching points for helping them to correct some of the things that they didn't do as well as they could have done.  It was invaluable help, and the sort of guidance I could do with more of!After that exciting day yesterday, I was not keen to get out of bed this morning, but I dragged myself up at 7.30am and had some breakfast and hot tea, before I went out to the chickens.  The morning feeding and watering took me an hour and a half today because I fed hot mash, had to unfreeze all the waterers, and carry the water to the chicken sheds from the house.  We didn't leave here for church until 9.40am (service starts at 9.30am!!) and I nearly thought twice about going as we were going to have to walk in late, but my luck was in and the service hadn't started at 9.45am!!  I was so glad that we went as the preacher was amazing - he was an elderly gentleman of 83, bent over with osteoarthritis, walking only with two sticks, but he was a true man of faith and his belief and faith was so strong, it was a real privilege to meet him and to listen to what he had to say.  He has been a Local Preacher since 1956; he told us that he almost died 17 years ago.  He told us of his experience - getting to the \"white light\" and the voice telling him that he had to go back as he still had a lot of work to do on Earth.  He was incredibly inspiring, and I do hope he comes back to preach to us again.I thought of Froog's batch cooking methods this afternoon.  I had to take the YFG to town to look for a pair of plain black tracksuit trousers for school tomorrow, so I popped into Tesco to look in the reduced section - and I struck lucky - lamb shanks, and stewing steak.  So when I got home, I put the lamb shanks in gravy in one casserole and the stewing steak with some onion and mushrooms and gravy into the other casserole and all of it went into the oven together for a couple of hours.  We have had the lamb for tea, and the beef casserole may well come out later in the week."},

{"title": "Changing my mind", "date": "Tuesday 23 November 2010", "text": "Tonight driving home from gym, I had a post forming in my mind about the skies in the Fens, inspired by the bright moonlight nights we are having and the clear days when the sun is shining beautifully.However, things change.  I have been incensed instead by the waste I see around me.  My children are tucked up in bed tonight (as they should be at 11.30pm!) with blankets, duvets and the odd hot water bottle.  We haven't put the heating on yet as the woodburner is blasting heat around the downstairs and when we go upstairs, we leap into bed pretty quickly, and with the blankets and hot water bottles, get warm and toasty pretty quickly too!  Another family in the street has two bedroom windows flung wide open tonight because their heating is on too high so they need to let the heat escape.  Whilst the more traditional among us wear jumpers in this weather, they like to sit around half-naked - the male members of the family are often seen walking around the house topless.  What makes me even more cross is that this is a family in which both adults went bankrupt a while back, and now the whole family lives on various benefits.  How is it right that they have enough spare cash to sit on their bums all day and heat a house to such epic proportions on taxpayers' money, whilst other people I know who go out to work and pay their taxes can't afford to do such stupid things - some can't even afford new shoes for their children.  The government needs to work hard to redress the balance, and I applaud anything that makes people contribute to society in a positive way, through working and paying their own way, through paying fair taxes, through voluntary work (my personal way of contributing) or just by being more responsible with resources.  I work, but don't earn enough to pay tax on my income, but the FH pays tax each month on his pension, and we pay the council tax too, so we are making our contribution, however small.Rant over.The fudge has been deemed successful by an independent judge.  I took the plunge and gave a little of it away today to a teacher at the school, and to a friend.  I will share the recipe tomorrow, and I think that I will have to make more!! I need to find a pretty but cheap way to package it as well.......  I am inspired to get on with my eBay plans as my friend has sold a second-hand dolls house on there for £120 and is very pleased.  I will be looking into that more after the weekend."},
{"title": "There's talk of snow", "date": "Monday 22 November 2010", "text": "Already we are hearing that the snow is on its way - rather early, I thought!  However, the temperatures here are well below average for the time of year, and I think that ukweathergeek hasn't got it all far wrong!  I think that I have said before  that I think he is talking a lot of sense, so I am taking notice of what he thinks about the coming winter - that it will probably be as bad as last winter, if not worse - and that he believes that the winter of 2011/12 may be even worse still.  His blog makes interesting reading, so I check back there now and again to see if he has posted updates.Today I have given the chooks some straw in their runs and they have had a grand time, scratching through it to look for tasty tidbits.  It helps to keep their feet a little drier for a time, at least until they have pushed it all down into the mud.The kitchen has also been in production today again - I found a recipe for chocolate fudge on an Australian savings website that I visit occasionally.  I thought that it would be an excellent choice to make for gifts, but never having attempted anything quite like it before, I decided that it would be wise to try it out first.  It was easy enough to make, but since I can't eat it, I will have to canvass opinions on it - the YFG thinks it tastes like thick icing but the EFG and the FH both said that they liked it.   I may have to look for more independent opinions before I go into production.  I will share it if the general thoughts are positive!!The lunchbox tins also needed refilling, so I made some Weetabix Brownies and some cheese scones too.  Several of the cheese scones mysteriously disappeared rather quickly, and I was only out of the room for a moment.........can't imagine where they went!Tonight the EFG and the YFG have had trouble at their respective band practises.  The YFG had ear-ache and said she couldn't play, but had to go along with the FH anyway.  The teacher seems to have been a little disappointed that she couldn't take part, so she gave her a pencil and taught her to conduct a little!! The EFG has a huge \"thing\" on the inside of her lip where she has bitten it whilst she has been asleep, and it was too painful for her to play her cornet so we abandoned her band and went to the supermarket.  In true stockpiling spirit in that I looked for all the bargains, the 3 for 2s and suchlike, I parted with rather a lot of dosh and filled the cupboards in anticipation of the snow and bad weather coming.  The bargain hunting knocked nearly £18 off the final bill!!  There is no point in the supermarkets being stocked if I can't get there to buy what I need, so I thought it was an opportune moment to stock up a little.  I know that I have a little leeway in the budget this month as the FH's credit card has gone astray so he hasn't spent anything, so I know there will be no bill coming from that direction this month (hurray!), not that he spends a lot on it, mostly just for his petrol!Lakeland received an order from me this morning in an attempt to get some of my Christmas shopping done!  I managed to find an obscure little site to order a couple of \"Gorjuss\" items that the EFG had asked for, but the YFG's list has had to be revised as she had gone drastically over budget.  When she gets round to finalising exactly what she wants, Amazon will be getting some business as well, as I spent sometime investigating best prices on the internet for the items on their lists, and Amazon consistently comes out the cheapest, and with free delivery and Nectar points too, it's hard to beat!Tonight I have been assessing our income and wondering.  I want to kill two birds with one stone and do some decluttering so it seems like a plan to sort out the \"good\" stuff and try to sell it on eBay or Amazon (sold a book on there last week!) at a time of year when people will be looking for bargains.  I will have to have a good look at what I want to discard and see if any of it is fit to sell.  Half of me would like to sell the Playmobil we have, but the other half thinks that it may still have a home here for a while yet.  Someone still likes to play with it now and again."},
{"title": "Kitchen report again", "date": "Saturday 20 November 2010", "text": "I made the Herman mixture into two fruitcakes, and they have turned out well.  When I took the two loaves out of the oven, I brushed them with a hot mixture of dissolved caster sugar with some orange essence/oil, so they smell gorgeous.  One has been sliced and sampled, now residing in a tin, and the other is heading for the freezer. Delia's mincemeat has sat in the oven for the requisite three hours, has come out \"swimming in fat\" as she puts it, and will now have to be stirred at very regular intervals for a couple of hours so that the fat coats the fruit and doesn't coagulate in to large lumps!  Once it is cool, probably in the morning, I will add the brandy and pot it up.  Smells lovely!"},
{"title": "Kitchen work today", "date": "Friday 19 November 2010", "text": "The Fen Kitchen is a busy place this morning - another batch of Delia's mincemeat is doing its 12 hour soaking, the Herman cake has just been fed and will be shared out today and then our portion cooked tomorrow - and there is a second batch of Leek and Potato soup bubbling away in the Remoska on the side.  We had some earlier in the week and the family liked it, so I thought I would use up the last remaining four leeks to make another pot of it.

{"title": "Shhhhhhh! Don't mention it....", "date": "Tuesday 16 November 2010", "text": "but I have to get some presents wrapped up tonight - it is the FH's birthday tomorrow!  The YFG helped to choose one gift when we went to the shops at the weekend, and the EFG is giving him a regular birthday favourite of his - Maltesers!  He will be going to his lunch club, but he will get a free lunch this week for his birthday.  When the folks there have a birthday, the birthday boy/girl provides everyone with some sweets, so I got a tub of Celebrations for him to take to share.  He has also asked for a lemon sponge at tea time, so I will be making that tomorrow too.Today has been interesting - I got a bit of a panicked phone call from the school this morning asking if I could go along this afternoon on the regular swimming trip to the local town.  One of the TAs was off so they were a person short.  Luckily, it was the last session so the children were having a fun splash session, so I didn't actually have to do much at all except be there and a bit of supervision.  It was lovely to watch them all having so much fun in the water!Tonight we have been to gym, and then came home to a lovely stew that the FH had made.  He didn't quite get as far as making the dumplings, which was a disappointment for the YFG but it was a good meal nevertheless.The YFG is excited as she is going on a trip to London tomorrow to the Natural History museum.  Her bag is packed and she is tucked up in bed, having booked her wake-up call for the morning.  It is a big thing, going to London, so she is looking forward to it all."},
{"title": "What is happiness?", "date": "Sunday 14 November 2010", "text": "I've been asked tonight if I am happy.......told that I don't sound very happy.....it's a bit of a blow, to be honest.  I don't know what the right answer to the question is, and I don't even know if there is a right answer.  So I decided to think about what makes me happy, and here are some random thoughts about it, in no particular order:SunshineMy familyBeing tucked up in bed with a hot water bottle!Listening to Classic FMReadingBeing up to date with things and organisedA tidy houseHaving time to listen to people and to GodA long hot bathMy chooks having a dust bath...........I could go on, and on.  The world is conspiring against me right now to stop a lot of those things happening, and I need to work out how to make them happen again.  Let's look at them slowly:The sunshine - well, it has rained a lot lately...can't do much about that - can't afford to move to California!My family - yep, that one is doing OK, they are all here, well and healthy (or as healthy as they are likely to get in the FH's case - foot is still swollen, cough is improving)Bed with the hot bottle - I get that one some nights if I remember.  The trouble with that one is that I am so tired when I get to go to bed that I have no time to lay there and enjoy the feeling before I fall asleep!!Classic FM - must sort the radio out in my car so it works again.  In the house, I get to listen to the radio more during the day when the girls are at school, so I should get a decent fix tomorrow.Reading - mmmmm, time constraints.  Reading is done in snatches, sometimes only in the smallest room!!!Up to date and organised - last week was manic so I am hoping to get somewhere with this one this week.A tidy house........a little boy commented to me yesterday that I should go and look at his room because he had tidied up and so it might give me some ideas.  Apparently I am now notorious for my untidiness, so bad that I need to take lessons from an 8 year old.  ;-)  I don't think it is that bad, really, but I will try harder this week!Time to listen to people and to God - must try harder.  The FH said he would take a photo of me the other day as it has been so busy this week that he had forgotten what I looked like. Long hot baths - I have had a couple this week - bliss!The chooks haven't a hope of a dust bath for months as they have just got mud, mud and more mud BUT I gave them lovely shavings and cut straw in their houses and they bathed in that instead and absolutely LOVED it.  They are due for clean bedding again tomorrow so I will be able to watch them again.There are things which are pre-occupying me at the moment - the amount of stuff I have to get my head around for the Chair of Governors role is mind-blowing, there seem to be medical appointments each week for someone (not me, thank goodness) to taxi people around to, gym needs some organising as we are currently putting together the arrangements for the Christmas party and thinking about how to get everyone who needs to go to Ipswich on the 27th, and I was in Bedford today for a 5 hour course on the role and responsibilities of the Welfare Officer in the club, and then there are a couple of girls here who just don't seem to want to go to bed!!!! I am happy with my lot, with my plans, with my situation in life right now.  I am not a bundle of laughs right now, I admit, but I never have been.  I feel positive about life, positive about the future, and not unduly worried about anything - so it's all good, as the EFG would say!"},
{"title": "The weekend is here - already", "date": "Saturday 13 November 2010", "text": "I can't believe how quickly the weeks are ticking along!  Someone said to me today that it is only 6 weeks until Christmas - and it seems like only a few weeks ago it was January and we were wondering what 2010 would have in store.....once Christmas is here, 2011 will be just around the corner.I have had to fetch the dehumidifiers from the shed - they have been stashed away for about 8 years, but I have been reading that some people are finding that they can get their washing dry more quickly by running a dehumidifier.  I am quite desperate this weekend to get the school uniforms dry so I thought that I would give it a go.  The verandah dries the washing well, but really only when the sun is shining, otherwise it takes a couple of days, which doesn't help at weekends when I need to get the things dry!  Hence I have a couple of airers full of washing around a dehumidifier in the office. Yesterday I went to Peterborough to the Christmas Festival at the showground. I took a friend and we had a mooch around for about 90 minutes, both buying some presents.  I was a little disappointed at the stalls that weren't there - and had a good time catching up with several old friends who were there!  Having had a stall at the show for about 5 or 6 years, we know a lot of the stall holders so there were a few catch ups to be had!  I bought some more bags from the bag lady who was there in October, but she had a wider selection this time.  I also got a couple of presents for the girls so they will have to remain hush hush for now.Two weeks today the YFG will be reprising her gym routines for the regional final of her last competition - we have to go to Ipswich for that.  It means that the five girls are still working hard at gym on those routines, as we know that the regional competition will be considerably stiffer than the county one was.  It will be a valuable experience for them to compete on a bigger scale.The Christmas cake was made yesterday morning before I went out - it was in the oven at 6am!  The house smelled gorgeous.  Now it has been poked with a skewer, enriched with a little more brandy, wrapped in greaseproof paper and tinfoil and put up in a tin in the cool of the utility room.  The other cake in the house at the moment is Herman!  We have been given some starter for the famous Herman cake - the YFG was quite disgusted at the thought of how old some of it may be, especially when I told her that my mum had a Herman cake about 25 years ago.  It is sitting in a bowl, covered with a cloth, on the counter - the instructions seem to have changed a little as I think my mum kept hers in the fridge.  The debate will be what to flavour him with - the FH is in favour of fruit, other opinion is in favour of cocoa, and it is possible that it would be lovely with a hint of lemon.  Maybe we will be making more than the one."},
{"title": "Round up of the week", "date": "Thursday 11 November 2010", "text": "I've been mindful of not spending too much time in cyberspace, hence the lack of posts this week.  I took the FH to the hospital on Monday about the prostate diagnosis; it was a very hit and miss affair.  The consultant is a lovely chap, who did a scan and an examination (ouch!) and declared that yes, the prostate gland is slightly enlarged but that in a man of almost 73, that is sort of to be expected.  Apparently, about 40% of men his age would be walking the streets with prostate cancer and never know.  He said that in most cases, it is a condition that one dies with, rather than from.  He is reluctant to do any more at the moment, because even if it was diagnosed as cancer, there is little that he could offer the FH because of his heart health and medication scenario.  A biopsy is the only way to actually diagnose it properly, and that would introduce an infection risk, and given that there is no treatment on offer, it seems a pointless risk to take.  So, for now, we wait.  The doctor at the local surgery is to repeat the blood test in January and the consultant will see the FH again in February to reassess the situation.Monday afternoon saw me at the optician with the EFG who now needs a new pair of glasses.  At this practice, I have to pay for the frames, so she chose wisely and is only costing me £40.  She's rather fed up with the current pair as she has had them for two years, so it is time for a change!Tuesday afternoon I floated around the school for a couple of hours, being available to any parents who might want to talk to me whilst they were there for Parents' Evening.  I shepherded them around the extension, and generally made myself useful, before taking the girls and going to gym for the second session. Yesterday I went back to school to go and help out in the Y3/4 class for the afternoon - we did experiments with magnets and Newtonmeters for science and then some art work on William Morris.  I really enjoyed that! Got to go now as lunch is ready - back later!"},
{"title": "Reflecting", "date": "Saturday 6 November 2010", "text": "We really are back from Scotland, but you would be forgiven for thinking that we had gone away again, because I haven't posted here all week.  In some ways, there has been so much to say that I haven't known where to begin, so I just didn't; in other ways, life has been too busy this week to allow me time to sit here and cogitate my thoughts about the week; and a leftover from the week's holiday has been a slight reluctance to lose the relaxation we enjoyed at the cottage - I just haven't wanted to get back into the same routines of reading forums and blogs.  I am trying to be more selective about the things I give my time.I kept a diary at the cottage, but I am not going to put it here because it will interrupt the flow of this blog.  I think that I will have a holiday blog and put the days and photos on there - when we got on another holiday, it can be updated.  The photos have made it from the camera onto the computer, but they still need to be edited and named, and some must be deleted because they are out of focus!!So, back in the Fens, what's to do?  The garden has been tidied up a little whilst we were away as UJ kindly dug over two of the veg beds.  He also made a trough to feed one of the runs of chickens, and the chicks seem to have doubled in size!  I needed to clean out the pens when we got home but I was unable to find any small bales of straw locally so in the end I bought a bale of horse bedding from the feed shop - it is chopped straw and woodshavings - and it is very good stuff.  It may even be better than the straw as I think it will break down for the composting bin more easily.  I have now found a source of straw and hope to get some next week, and then I will decide which is best.  We definitely need some straw to put down in the runs as there has been so much rain that they are very muddy indeed.  There are too many chickens here now and some will have to be dispatched soon - some to the freezer and some to the auction!The house has had a bit of an autumn clean - I was inspired by the cottage as there was no clutter there and it felt so much easier to tidy up!  I will be joining Wannabe Sybil on her clutterbusting missions this week and really making an effort to get rid of some \"stuff\".......And Christmas is on the horizon - plans to be made, cakes to be baked!  I have a favourite Christmas cake recipe from the old Family Circle magazine which I have been making for years, and will be doing so again this year - I usually do it at half term, so I had better get on with it this week.  The mincemeat I made the other week has developed nicely!  The FH came home from Scotland with a craving for a mincemeat pie, so I made some pastry last Sunday and made a big pie for here and one for UJ to take home as well as some small coconut tarts for the lunchboxes.  Each of the pies took a whole jar of mincemeat, but they all said how much they liked it, so I will be making a little more!!The FH and the EFG are both on Amoxicillin for their chest infections, the YFG has pulled a ligament in her hip and I have a sore throat tonight, so we are a right lot here.  The FH's ankle and foot are still swollen too.  AND he has to go to the hospital on Monday for investigations into his prostate gland.  He has absolutely no symptoms of any trouble, but a routine blood test has picked up some marker in his blood so we have to go and have it checked out.  Better to be safe than sorry.I'm going to spend some time organising those holiday photos now, so I'll be back!"},

The train journeys yesterday were a bit challenging - some of them were OK but some were a nightmare!

Lots of signed songs as well as some lovely action rhymes from Reception - and a wonderful Harvest Rock and Roll song which the kids loved to sing.10am Church Council meeting - all is well there too and lots of events in the pipeline for the year ahead.2.30pm Book fair at a school in the north of the county - sold off a load of books at slightly discounted prices to make some space in the garage - good take up of interest and sold about £130.7pm Cooking competition in the chapel - hilarious fun - truly enjoyable evening and people said that they really loved the idea (thank goodness) so we raised £120 to split between Macmillan  and the chapel and hopefully the Pampered Chef lady got some publicity out of it too.11pm went to bed quite tired!!Today is going to be all hustle and bustle as well.  We will be going to a chapel coffee morning shortly, then we have to get the house ready for the off tomorrow, pack the bags too, and still go to gym this afternoon.  Unfortunately, the FH has got one of his terrible foot problems come on overnight and can't put his foot to the floor this morning and is in a lot of pain.  Quite how we are going to manage the journey tomorrow with him on crutches, I don't know, but we will cross that bridge when we come to it! Off to get on.  Will be back tonight or early tomorrow morning and then there will be silence in the Fens for a week........"},

The children sang songs and Christian worship songs, read out prayers and made up a little quiz describing fruits and vegetables so we could guess what they were talking about.  Our minister from the chapel was there as well, to conclude with some prayers and thanks.  All in all it lasted about half an hour and it was followed by an invitation to the parents to go through to the class rooms so that they could look at the children's work.  I really enjoyed it, and it sort of made up for missing the Harvest celebration at chapel which was the same day as the Autumn show.  The KS1 Harvest assembly is on Thursday, so I may pop into that if I have time to see what they have been doing, too.The FH is outside, planting broad bean seeds.  I have completed the cleaning out of the hen houses this morning so that they are all in good order for UJ to oversee next week.  I have washed everything in sight and there is just one more load of ironing to do and then that might be it.  (I still have to unearth UJ's bedroom, but just whisper that bit.....I'm going to do some of that now....)"},

I have also been through my \"friends\" on Facebook - so many of them were not really friends but acquaintances, and people whose incessant chatter was beginning to annoy me.  They are gone too.

I am worrying about everything I have to do Before We Go, and trying to get the washing up to date.  What with having to buy a new washing machine last Monday and then all the wet weather we had, and me feeling unwell, there is rather a heap to get washed...the girls are being thoughtful, though, and keeping the clothes that they want for the holiday to one side. We have been to gym today, and then this afternoon, I sat and read the paper for a while before I began to do some work outside.  I made a lovely beef stew for tea, and there is plenty left for tomorrow so I am pleased about that - it was very tasty, and less work for tomorrow.  I have a list for tomorrow to begin when we get home from church, so I am looking forward to ploughing through that!We bought a couple of cheap (£3) DVDs today so that we can take them on holiday.  I really don't care what we get up to as long as we have a change from the usual and have a rest!  It is not that I want to get away from life, but I would really like a week off and that is what I hope I am getting!!  A week away from chickens, neighbours, gym, school, computers, phones, etc - in a way, I feel like I want to retreat from the world!!  Just to be the four of us, having some fun and relaxation - the EFG's biggest fear is how she will charge up her Ipod without a computer as it uses the USB port to charge - so I told her to have a week off, but no, she said she will download music onto her phone and use that instead as that has a normal charger.  \"They DO have electricity up there, don't they?\" was one question earlier this week (sorry, Susan!!) which I laughed at - I think that the girls think we are going to the back of beyond - they should know better as where we live now is almost there already!!  My biggest temptation will be to stay away from the estate agent's/solicitor's windows whilst we are up there - very tempting indeed."},

I didn't do an awful lot for the rest of the day, but I went to gym to help set up the equipment; that was really too much for me and I came home before the first class began, having arranged for someone else to bring the girls home.  I slept for a couple of hours then, then several more hours during the day yesterday - and I am just beginning to feel more normal.  I still don't feel right, but I feel less wrong!

They had displays like this one for alternative ways to grow veg and there were even cabbage plants growing in a tonne bag from a builders' merchants!The majestic Shire Horses were there as well - we watched one class being judged.We loved this stall in the shopping area - BAGS!These jute duffel bags are just gorgeous!  I looked, went away and thought hard, then came back and bought 6!!  They are just perfect for all the girls we want to give Christmas gifts to, and at just £3.50 each, an absolute bargain!  And they look so much more expensive too!  The lady doesn't have a website yet, but I have her email address, so anyone who is interested in these fab bags can email me or contact me through the comments and I will be glad to share it.One of the girls took this picture as they both loved this display of hand-painted canvas shoes - they were fantastic and must have taken hours of work.  Not entirely practical to wear, I would have thought, but very beautiful to look at!Peterborough Horticultural Society put on an amazing display each year, so we were delighted to be able to get a picture of just a small segment of it.  It was impossible to take a shot of the whole thing as there were just too many people standing in front of it all the time!A little sign that gave us a big chuckle!Quite a few stews' worth of onions here!!

We made it to the showground by 8am, and then had to find out what to do next, it being our first time at this show.  A helpful steward was very patient explaining what to do and we penned all the birds successfully. We wandered around the show together, nipping back to the car periodically for refreshments, and occasionally checking the pens to see if any of the birds had been sold.  By lunchtime, both pens of young Gold Partridge Orpingtons had been sold, but the Sebrights had to be knocked down to sell right at the end (but I really didn't want to bring them home!) and the Silver-laced Wyandotte did have to come home, even though I also discounted them.We took loads of photos (which I will share when I can get them off the camera) and enjoyed a brief cup of tea at the FH's cousin's house before coming home.  Luckily, I had prepared some mince for shepherd's pie last night, so I was able to make a quick meal when we got home!  The girls are finishing some homework now, and I have to iron the uniforms for tomorrow - and then my feet need a rest!!"},

I also have to unearth his bedroom - confession time - I put a lot of stuff up there last Christmas when the lounge was decorated, and it has been breeding since so it is not actually possible to see any floor at all.........the shame........I have two weeks - you may not hear much from me."},

I have to go to a meeting in December to be paired up with a suitable LP, so there is no great rush with it all, but I am very excited to have got this whole thing moving - it has only taken about 14 years.........My great-grandfather was a LP in a different circuit, so I think that my dad will be quite pleased to hear this when he gets home from his latest cruise (ports towards Yalta and Odessa) at the end of the month."},

My chickens have very muddy feet, however much straw I put down in their yards, and I squelch from one yard to another to clean their water pots out and put their food in.Tonight the FH and the YFG have taken three ladies from chapel to a brass band concert in a nearby town - it is free, but I suspect that they will be buying tea and biccies at half time.  The ladies were all pleased to be asked to go yesterday when I saw them - it was rather short notice as I didn't see the advert until yesterday.  I hope that they are having a good evening.  There is a solo trombonist from the Royal Opera House and a trombone quartet from Trinity Music College, so I hoped that it would inspire the FH who is trying to master the trombone himself!!Yesterday's trip to Cambridge was frustrating, as I explained in a comment yesterday to Susan - there were just three minutes spent with the dentist, to approve the YFG's suitability for treatment.  We have to return on 5/11 for \"records\" to be taken, and then go back again on 20/12 to have the braces fitted.  I so wish that they could have allowed time to take the records yesterday once he had checked her over. The EFG and I have moved some chickens around tonight: the Light Sussex and GPO hens are sharing a nunnery to give them a break from their husbands for a month or two - until January - and I have freed up some space for the chicks hatched this year to have a couple of pens in the shed.  The chicks are all growing well now and I am pleased with them.  The empty pens can be cleaned out tomorrow and then the chicks can be moved tomorrow evening - it's always best to move chickens at night so that a) they can't see so they are more easily handled and b) they recognise the new house as their home and return to it at night."},

The YFG has a \"fang\" - one of her teeth hasn't got room to come down properly and has emerged above the other teeth in her gum, at the side of her mouth.

And that was being chucked in at the deep end, up the creek without the paddle and all the other sayings that mean in over my head!The existing Chair decided he needed a break from it after about 4 years of doing the job, but there is really only me to do the job in his stead - we are short of Governors by three; of those that are there, five are excluded from the job by virtue of being employed at the school; one is going to live abroad any day; three more are brand new and were attending their first meeting, and the other one was just attending for the second time.  I did manage to get the outgoing Chair to be the Vice-Chair, so that I can call upon him for help and support, but I will be spending sometime over the weekend doing an online \"Taking the Chair\" course on the local government portal, and reading, reading, reading all the papers I have now acquired.I'm also helping a lovely lady on the estate with a community blog, running an afterschool gym club once a week, helping to run the big gym club, doing stuff at church, and slowly giving up on housework.  The poor chickens have been shortchanged this week as I usually go up there and sit and natter at them now and again whilst I am looking them over, but there hasn't been the time this week for too long sat looking, and the rain has been atrocious too.  More forecast for tomorrow!I am SO looking forward to our holiday at the end of the month.  No computers, emails, phone calls, housework beyond the bare minimum to keep the place tidy, little washing, no ironing, no school uniforms to wash, no chickens to feed and clean out for a week - gosh, what will I do!?!We are looking forward to walking, sightseeing, and long, cosy evenings watching DVDs and reading!! And two eight-hour train rides will be bliss!  We are going here whilst my uncle is in residence here to look after everything for us.There was a boy back in primary school that I sat next to for a year when we were about 8, I think, although we had been in classes together since we were four.  Adam's birthday is two days after mine, so it is today.

I think not, my dear - that's a whole two years away and there's lots to do before then!!  On the other hand, at least once I am 40, people will stop saying, \"Oh, you're nearly 40!\" Perhaps it will be a badge of honour to have made it!Yesterday was a lovely birthday: the girls brought me a birthday candle stuck into a cupcake at 7am and sang Happy Birthday to me, and they gave me their presents - some nail varnish and a big selection of smellies for the bath.  The FH doesn't \"do\" presents but told me to get myself something, so I did - Nigel Slater's Tender Vol II - all about fruit.  (I saw it at half price in Tesco and thought it would be lovely - and it is!!)  More cards arrived in the post. A friend came around for a chat with a present - a beautiful glass worktop saver with a huge picture of veg on it - she knows me well!!  Later on, the FH cooked me a lovely lunch of steak, mushrooms, carrots, cabbage and potatoes.  I went to gym later still, where I got another card. When we got home from gym, I made some pudding and the FH and I  had a glass of wine and sat together to watch \"Keeping Mum\" - hilarious film with Maggie Smith, Rowan Atkinson and Kristin Scott-Thomas.

{"title": "Mincemeat musings", "date": "Tuesday 28 September 2010", "text": "I made the mincemeat according to Froog's instructions, and then, after I had it all jarred up, I looked in my Delia's Happy Christmas book to see how the methods compared.  Froog uses Delia's recipe with some adaptations.Delia puts all the ingredients (she also adds some whole almonds) apart from the brandy, into a large bowl and leaves it to soak for at least 12 hours.  She doesn't jar it whilst it is hot, but advocates stirring it occasionally as it cools so that the hot fat is distributed through the mincemeat and coats the other ingredients.  She still hasn't added the brandy.........that doesn't go in until the mincemeat is \"quite cold\" which I take to mean - COLD - not \"nearly cold\".  I suppose that means that none of the brandy is evaporated off during the cooking and could result in a more boozy mincemeat.  Then she puts it into the jars.I have more brandy now so I am thinking of looking for more jars and making a second batch using the Delia method to see if my chief taster can find a difference.  I will need more as I always make loads of mince pies, so I may as well experiment a little.  I am also thinking that the slow-cooker may have been a little too hot for this - I put it on the Auto setting - and I will try the second batch in the low oven.  I may also treat myself to a proper zester so that I don't have to just grate the lemon and orange peel.It may take a while to accumulate the jars, so I'll post the results in a week or two.Four and a half jars of mincemeat - just been put in the jars and smelling wonderful!I made it in the slow-cooker - looking divine...The rug we picked up at the garage sale for just £2.  It was destined for the conservatory but then we thought we would try it out in the lounge and it looks fine.  We had been wanting something in here for a while, and the colours go well with our pink walls and green curtains.Just to see the detail on the cornerThis is a lamp which hold a tea-light.  I thought it would be nice to have on the table in the conservatory, but I took the photo in the lounge as it was dark outside.

The YFG went out for a walk with the neighbours and Sinbad the dog, so the EFG and I thought we would settle down in front of the fire to watch The Secret Garden (the Maggie Smith version) since it was raining but hey, JB came on only about 20 minutes into it, so we had to give over and let JB reign supreme..........I was told that it was OK as I was planning to go and \"play at cooking\" so that is what I did.

The lounge is nice and cosy, and the gang are all sitting around, watching Michael MacIntyre - he is a hilarious comic, and he very rarely swears or says anything terribly rude, but he IS just funny in himself somehow. We have loads of fire wood for the winter, and probably next winter too.  I have been reading a website which predicts another cold winter like last year, with considerable snowfall again.  It's here and is very interesting: the thermohaline current which drives the gulf stream is waning badly - and there are satellite images which show that on the blog.  The influx of fresh water from the melting ice at the pole is not helping, and the whole lot adds up to cooling for us here!

It flew at the windows and then we managed to catch it and let it out.  Hope that doesn't happen too often!This warm weather is lovely but most unseasonable - the temperature today has been about 6 degrees above the average for the time of year - and when we came out of gym tonight at 8pm, the thermometer in the car still said 21!  No wonder we were hot.  Another scorcher is predicted for tomorrow but I won't be sorry if it is a bit cooler as the conservatory at the back of the house is really making the office and the kitchen HOT!I have been inspired by a friend who blogs; she shared \"50 things she loves\" earlier this week so I am currently preparing my own list, but the trouble is that I haven't been able to stop at 50 so there is a bit of editing required!  Hope to be able to share that tomorrow but I haven't had time to start the baking for Friday yet so I must make that a priority for the To Do list in the morning."},

I hate doing it with a vengeance but it is such a simple thing to get to grips with once you have collated all the information - and I always put off doing it because the Thought of doing it is so much worse than actually getting on with it.  But 'tis done. At last. Until next year.UJ came over to tea last night, and brought pears, beetroot and runner beans.  The harvest is slowing down now.  We had a roast chicken and lots of veg with roast potatoes, and then, later on when all that had settled, I made Rhonda-Jean's chocolate self-saucing pudding which was lovely.  I also made another couple of the banana and chocolate cakes, but someone had helped themselves to the other half of the bar of chocolate I had kept so I had to open another one - hopefully I have hidden it more effectively this time!  It is UJ's 71st birthday today, so I sent him home with the smaller 1lb loaf cake to enjoy today and this week. Today I have been hitting the housework and getting a little straighter after the weekend, as well as beginning to make some arrangements for the Macmillan coffee morning on Friday.  I want to make some cupcakes tonight and freeze them un-iced so that I can grab them out of the freezer on Thursday night and just decorate them.  It will be easier if I can do some of the work ahead of time.  The weather has been fine and blowy today which has been excellent for getting the washing dry - cue a heap of ironing for later on!!"},
{"title": "New places, new people", "date": "Thursday 16 September 2010", "text": "I've led a new after-school gym class today at a school right in the northern part of the Fens.  I took assistance along in the form of an Assistant Coach as I had been warned that we had 20 children from KS2 to deal with, and I knew that that was too many for one person.  We arrived a little ahead of schedule, which was fine as it gave us time to get the mats on the floor.  There aren't enough yet, but the Head has ordered more, which should be there at the end of next week, although probably not in time for our session next Thursday.  There were 18 children who actually turned up as two were off sick, apparently.  Of those 18, one was a huge challenge, two were handfuls and the rest were great.  The huge challenge was a child who obviously had some anger management issues, made a racist remark to another child which I shall have to report to the Head in the morning, and generally annoyed the other children to distraction. This child had no attention span, let alone a short one - I could have managed a short one, but none at all is a problem.  So, I am going to have to ask for help with this child - I am hoping that the Head will send in a TA to help the child to \"access\" the session more appropriately as the behaviour we saw today could be dangerous for the other children in the session.  Schools today are keen to be inclusive, but gymnastics is a sport where we need the children to focus and behave as we only have one pair of hands and sometimes children have to wait for a turn! Apart from that, the session was fun, the kids had a laugh but learned some new skills too, and we are keen to teach them plenty of gym - we have four more sessions with these children and then we are going to have some KS1 children after half-term.Tonight I have been with the YFG to an information evening at the secondary school to learn more about the curriculum she will be following, and to find out about the new review and assessment system that they are going to be using.  I am already getting \"i-behave\" emails from teachers about both of the girls - positive ones - but soon I will be able to go online and look at their attendance percentages, their targets, etc all on a website which is updated daily as far as attendance is concerned but at least half-termly with reports and targets.  It should cut down the paperwork and postage for the school, and we will be able to access the information at home.  I met a few of her teachers and her form tutor, and they all say how well she has settled in - thank goodness.  She is pleased that she knows where all her classes are now, and she has signed up for art club, choir and the Anti-bullying council, so she is keen to get involved.The EFG is also doing well, although she has some frustrations - the art class isn't exactly what she thought it would be, but she is enjoying the art, even if she thinks that the teacher doesn't like her!  She's cross that her old French teacher said that the EFG would have her as her teacher if she did it for GCSE - but she has another teacher instead, and one we are not entirely confident in.  He was her Spanish teacher last year and even I found him a little too laid back when I met him at the parents' evenings.  I said that I would have to resurrect my GCSE French from way back when and give her a hand - I got an \"A\" so I ought to be able to remember some of it!!  It was only about 22 years ago - the mere blink of an eye....I have posted my entry to the East of England Autumn show at Peterborough to sell some chickens in the poultry sale.  A pair of Silver-laced Wyandotte bantams (Bruce and Betty) are off, as well as the Gold-laced Sebright pair and a trio and a pair of GPOs are up for sale.  I have no idea how to price them so I have agreed with the Secretary of the show that I will price them on the day with the help of the Stewards, who know more about this than I do - it depends on how good the birds are, he says, so hopefully mine aren't too bad.  We shall see.The posters for the Macmillan coffee morning on the 24th September finally arrived today, so I shall be going round the village in the morning to put them up everywhere, and then I shall have an hour or two over the weekend browsing through my baking books and looking for inspiration.  I often say that, but I am pretty sure that a large lemon sponge and some Twinks hobnobs will definitely be part of the line-up as well as some cupcakes of some kind since I now have two rather splendid wire cupcake towers upon which to display them.  We raised about £180-£200 last year, so I am hoping we will get somewhere near that again this year.I must get around to watching this week's episode of the Great British Bake-off on i-player, but it is a matter of getting access to the laptop at a convenient time as the sound is dire on this desktop machine.  I do like to watch it as I seem to learn from Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry all sorts of tips and hints, and I love to see the \"signature\" bakes from the contestants each week.  I have two bananas heading for the brown spotty/mushy stage, so I should be able to make another chocolate and banana loaf this weekend, as long as the FH doesn't decide to eat them.  I am trying to control his wheat intake so that he can lose some weight (it is working - 3lbs off last week) but that means that he often eats fruit for breakfast instead of cereal.  It is one way of getting some of oour vast stock of frozen fruit eaten - stewed plums for breakfast make a change from the standard fare!"},

It is tipping it down out there now! This week has been a busy one so far - a massive sorting out and tidying up for winter in the garden, although there is still more to be done; a rabbit-cleaning out session, moving hen houses around, pulling up dying beanstalks, etc.  There was also gym yesterday, and today I have been washing, changing beds, and chatting!  One was a long chat with a friend who's really going through the mill at the moment - I was with her for several hours this afternoon; the other chat was just a brief one over a cup of tea, with a friend who came to buy some eggs.  The hens are not laying a lot at the moment as they are beginning to moult, so I had to go and scour the henhouses for some eggs for her, and then I only managed to find four.Nothing wise or wonderful to share tonight, but hoping that everyone is well, and hugs all round!"},
{"title": "Confessions from the Fens", "date": "Sunday 12 September 2010", "text": "It won't make tabloid headlines, but there are a few things I feel a little bad about - I haven't done any exercise for the past four weeks as, although it worked whilst we were in a routine, the last two weeks of the holidays were totally without routine, and we all had a rest, so the exercises went by the wayside.  I felt better when I was exercising five mornings a week, so come tomorrow, I will be starting them again.  Same time slot in the morning, same DVDs.  I similarly fell off the Slimming World wagon as the diet wasn't suiting my IBS stomach, so I am trying to modify it somewhat to balance the needs of losing weight without living two feet from a toilet all the time!I didn't get the scones made for the village show, either - I wanted them to taste fresh, and thought that the best time to make them was either going to be late Friday night or early Saturday morning.  That just didn't happen, as those times were dominated with being tired after gym and then in the morning, with getting everything normal done before I go to gym at 9am.  I didn't manage to get up any earlier to fit it all in....On the PLUS side, I spent an hour and a half today cleaning out all eight pens in the \"new\" chicken shed - so then all the chooks had a lovely time rearranging the straw and generally doing their own housekeeping - you can imagine the conversations (well, I can, but then perhaps I'm weird!), \"What has she been doing to my house?  It wasn't this when we went out to lunch, Bruce!\" \"I know, I know, Betty, but look - clean straw - have a good rummage and if you find anything to eat in then, give me a holler and I'll be in!\"  \"You're always thinking of your stomach!\" Bruce and Betty are the pair of Silver-Laced Wyandottes, and they are gorgeous! The BEST news of the day is that the last hatch of the year has happened - we have 10 chicks in the box under the lamp in the lounge.  There are 9 Light Sussex and a brown one - it's either a Brown Sussex or a GPO - we'll be able to tell when it gets a little bigger.  There are still another 15 (I think) eggs in the incubator, so there may be a few more chaps in the morning, but I am thrilled with 10 so I won't be disappointed if this is our lot.  They are lovely little birds, and with 9 of them being yellow, look like traditional \"chicks\".  Very happy mama here tonight."},

{"title": "A tiring Tuesday which brought on a restful Wednesday!", "date": "Wednesday 8 September 2010", "text": "Gym was just plain hard work last night!  With the HC on crutches still, the main burden of the setting out of the equipment fell to me, although the sports centre manager was a star and helped me to put the double trampette and the A bars out.  Then, later, a couple of Y10 girls came in and helped as well, so between us we had it all out by 4.15pm, ready for a rest before the kids came in to start at 5pm.There were a couple of new children and one with an obnoxious father who took a bit of dealing with, but the class itself was OK.  Those children left at 6pm and the second class came in - about 25 or so, I think.  It worked out in the end, but I changed groups a couple of times to help people out, although I had a lovely group of 4 girls to start with - particularly nice girls!  I'll try to teach them again next week...And then we had to put everything away again.....oh, my! I perspired, I glowed, I just plain sweat!  The weather yesterday was humid anyway, but by 8pm, I was rather tired!Why do I do it then, if it is so hard?  Well, I enjoy it - I enjoy the company of the other coaches, I love teaching the kids and seeing them \"get\" a move, and I love doing something that absorbs me so completely - I don't think about anything else whilst I am there.  So I keep going back. The first week of term is hard because the kids are coming back and getting back into the swing of it all, the parents are thrusting envelopes with their payments in at me left, right and centre, new kids and parents are asking 101 questions, and the new kids sometimes take some time to settle in - but often the parents take longer to adjust to our way of doing things eg obnoxious dad last night was filling in the reg form for his daughter and as the other kids were on the floor in a big circle, he says in an annoyed tone of voice, \"Can she not get involved in this then?\" to me as I am filling in paperwork for another parent.  So I said, \"Of course,\" and sent the EFG to help his daughter into the line.  I didn't really feel like explaining that most of the time, new kids are nervous, like his was, and it doesn't do them any harm to watch for a minute and understand what is going on.So after all that, today has been a bit slower!  I have ordered tickets for the FH and UJ to go to a concert featuring Soham Comrades Band at Tattersalls in Newmarket at the end of the month - a solo euphonium player from the world-famous Grimethorpe Colliery Band will be playing with the band.  I have watched two episodes of the Great British bake off on iPlayer.  I have been reading the book, \"The 19th Wife\" which I picked up in the doctor's surgery yesterday for 50p when I took the FH for blood tests.  I've done a little washing, and ironing and looked after the chooks.  Bread was made this morning - I decided that if I didn't feel too enthusiastic about work, I had better get the machines going to do some so one made a wholemeal loaf, which has been sliced and frozen, and I made a dough for a couple of French sticks in the other.  The girls and FH ate most of one of them with raspberry jam when the girls got home from school.Hope everyone is well - and good night, all!"},
{"title": "A good day all round", "date": "Monday 6 September 2010", "text": "I didn't cross many things off the \"To Do\" list with which I started the day - I haven't finished the tax return, I haven't done the filing, I haven't found a membership card I need.......but hey, I have done other things instead - funny how it goes like that!I have cut the back lawn, which was Hard Work as it hasn't been cut all summer as it has had chicken arks here and there all over it and they have made the occasional bare-ish batch which has been reseeded.  About five trips to the compost heap saw the job done and the compost heap overflowing a little.  I have taken the EFG to band practise tonight, and I have dug up some self-set lavatera plants from the veg beds - they seem to have a tap root which heads for Australia and is a challenge to get out.  I heaved on each one when I had loosened them with a fork, and had to use both hands - it made me let out a big sigh each time I got one out and there was imminent danger of me falling backwards with the force!  I cleaned the lounge and hall this morning, and had a couple of conversations with people about gymnastics too as we start back there tomorrow.  The HC is still on crutches...Busy day all round, but I feel pleased with what I have done and I will have to tackle some of the things I missed tomorrow.  Must find that membership card!I splurged tonight.  I went to Sainsbury's and I bought this.  Go on, have a quick peek!Had a look?  I have several of her books and like to try some of her recipes occasionally, and use them as inspiration for slight deviations.  The FH calls her the Artery Clogging Cook, so we don't always follow the recipes to the letter.Anyway - it was on offer at £12.99, and I used £12.50 of Nectar point, so cost to me was just 49p. Bargain!It worked!  The recipe made a 2lb loaf and a 1lb loaf - the original recipe said to use a 1.2l loaf tin, whatever size that is.  The family have eaten the 1lb loaf and the 2lb one is in the freezer.So, I used:150g margerine (Stork, in my case)185g light brown sugar2 eggs, beaten150ml milk300g plain flour1tsp bicarbonate of soda3 mashed bananas - brown with spots!50g Tesco value dark chocolate - that amounts to half a bar, chopped up50g walnuts, choppedI turned the oven on to 160c as it is a fan oven (apparently, you'd need it at 180C if it wasn't).  I popped Lakeland loaf liners into the loaf tins, and then I used an electric hand beater to cream the margerine and sugar together.  Then, in one go, contrary to the instructions, I added everything else and gave it all a jolly good stir. I filled the small pan first and then the larger one, and placed them side by side on a baking tray, and put them on the middle shelf of my oven.  They cooked for about 50 minutes, then I tested them with a sharp knife and removed the smaller loaf.  I cooked the larger one for another 12-14 minutes, and then it was done.  The outside does go a nice chocolate brown colour, and the inside looks yummy and they smell gorgeous!  I made the gang resist the temptation to eat them until they were cooler, but the recipe does suggest that they are nice served warm - perhaps with ice cream for a pudding?The official recipe is to be found at www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk if you'd prefer.  I will edit the photos in later when I have retrieved them."},
{"title": "An observation from yesterday", "date": "Sunday 5 September 2010", "text": "The YFG and I went to Tesco's cafe yesterday for a cheap date!  She had a bowl of chips and a drink and I had a mug of tea - grand sum of £2.80!!  The attraction for her is that we sit in the balcony where the cafe is situated and we can watch the shoppers below - we look out for people we know, people who look interesting, etc and we do a bit of People Watching, and I sit there and wonder who these people are and what their lives are like!  We find it fascinating.At about 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, there were quite a lot of people in there.  One thing struck me as I looked at what was in the trolleys and the people pushing them - the older the person was, the more likely it was that the products in the trolley were \"top\" brands: Ariel/Persil washing powder in big boxes, Andrex loo rolls, etc.  Younger people tended not to have so many of the \"big brands\" in their trolleys, either choosing the Tesco own brands or the Value ranges.  I sat there pondering why that was.....I wonder whether it is because perhaps those brands were the ones that were in existence before the supermarkets came along in the 70s and 80s, and those people have grown used to them so they stick with them.  I know that when my mum died in 1998 and my dad and uncle had to start doing more things without her guidance, they stuck instinctively to the brands she had always bought and used, and to some extent they still do, 12 years later - its partly habit, perhaps, and partly some reluctance to change.  I have been using www.moneysavingexpert.com for so long now that I am used to the downshifting challenge and very rarely buy \"big branded\" anything - there are some exceptions like Heinz ketchup, as no other tastes quite the same, but that is about it!"},
{"title": "Scone recipe deviation", "date": "Saturday 4 September 2010", "text": "I finally got around to trying the scones with fruit tonight - the last batch are still in the oven.  I added 3oz Tesco Value mixed dried fruit to the recipe, and the FH says that they are brilliant.  Instead of cutting them out with a 3\" diameter cutter, which means that one can only get 8 or 9 scones from the mixture, I am using a 1\" cutter and getting about 24!  They are also rising more evenly than the first batch as I stopped myself from twisting the cutter in the dough to release the dough; instead I am just pushing it down very firmly and then lifting it out of the dough.  It seems to do the trick!I also made a chocolate and banana loaf - I have got to stop buying bananas on a regular basis as there are always some left to go brown and mushy.  I'll take some pictures tomorrow when I cut it and when it has been tasted, I'll post the recipe if it is deemed to be any good!"},
{"title": "Stuff's happening around the place", "date": "Friday 3 September 2010", "text": "Not just around here, but around the world.  Watching the news today, it seems like we are going to be facing inflation in food prices, based on problems with the wheat harvest.  I thought wheat = bread to start with, but then I listened some more and realised that no, wheat = a whole lot more than just bread!  Flour will obviously be affected but the knock-on effect will be far wider - the price of animal/chicken feed will have to rise in proportion as well, which will then impact on egg/chicken/meat/milk prices, I should think, and perhaps pasta too.  So Russia has extended its ban on exporting wheat, keeping it for its domestic market, the floods in Pakistan are also causing shortages of food, and the weather here is making the harvest a challenge; I can hear a combine harvester still out in the fields at the back of the house here now.  If it isn't raining, the combines are out and about, and they keep working into the night.  I have just read in the newspaper that a farmer left a trailer of wheat half-full in his field at 2am, and someone stole most of the wheat from the trailer and abandoned the trailer in a layby a few miles away.  That wheat stolen was worth £1200, and represents a significant proportion of that farmer's income that he can't afford to lose.The FH and I had a sort through the freezers today and were pleased with what we recorded as being in there.  There are loads of plums, berries, stewed apples, green beans, broad beans, asparagus, peppers, peas, strawberries, gooseberries, cherries, broccoli, cauliflower, tomato sauce a la GTM's recipe, HM cakes, bread, rolls, rhubarb, chickens (home butchered as well as bought), sausages, mince, sausagemeat and frozen puff pastry to make sausage plait, ice cream, stewing steak, ratatouille.....gosh, I can't think what else - tonnes of stuff!  We realised that we really don't need to buy any fruit and veg at all for weeks.  We don't NEED to, but this isn't the kind of fruit to put in lunchboxes, so I will have to buy some apples or oranges for that, but not for a while as I have a stash in the fridge.  We obviously have loads of meat, too.  So, after all that, I went to Tesco and stocked up the storecupboard with flour, sugar, pasta, tinned this and that, loo roll, etc - all my store staples, so that I am hoping I can get away without any major shopping trips at all this month as we make a concerted effort to eat from the freezers.  It is only because UJ and HC give us fruit and veg, as well as the FH's friend B, and we grow our own, that we have all this bounty.I was thrilled and very surprised that the Family and Friends Railcard that I ordered just yesterday arrived this morning, and in the same post, all the tickets for our October trip north.  Given that there are four of us travelling, with seat reservations, there is a BIG wadge of tickets, but they came so quickly!  You can't beat that for service.  We are travelling north from Peterborough, straight through to Aberdeen, then changing for Forres.  When we come back, though, we are going from Forres to Inverness, changing for Edinburgh and then changing again for Peterborough.  I am pleased as we will see the beautiful Scottish scenery in the morning during the return journey - so good vibes for the weather up there on the 30th October, please!School has gone well again today, and the girls are both in bed now.  The EFG has an early start for a gym course in Cambridge in the morning - she and the FH will be leaving here at about 8am, I think.  The YFG and I will be here, and I will be filing all the papers I have on the office floor tonight!  I'm off now to read the latest issue of the Home Farmer magazine whilst enjoying a cup of tea. Night, all!"},

She took herself off to bed at 8.30pm, so she's tired, but I am relieved that all has gone well today. I have booked the train tickets for our trip in October, organised the hire car, bought the railcard, and done quite a bit of mooching around thinking about things.  I have, I admit, been clock watching rather a lot - knowing the school day, I kept thinking of what they would be doing all day!!  Maybe I'll be able to focus a little more tomorrow.The scones (post below somewhere) turned out well, so I thought I would experiment and try them with some dried fruit, not least because there is a cookery class for \"fruited scones\" in the village show on the 11th September, so if I can get fruit into those scones, I think I am onto a good thing.  I'm not sure how much fruit to add, so the FH may get several trial runs to eat - he won't complain, I'm sure!!"},
{"title": "Photos from last weekend", "date": "Thursday 2 September 2010", "text": ">This is the welcoming entrance to Lutton St Nicholas church.  Lutton is a small village just outside Long Sutton in Lincolnshire.My uncle, P, is the churchwarden there and he told us that this church has been here over 600 years.  It is in a bit of a state at the moment as the congregation continues to raise money for its repair.  These annual Flower Festivals have raised over £20,000 in the last 6 years and the work is progressing well, although there is still a lot to be done.This arrangement was loosely based around a Zoo theme, hence the letter Z nearby.The Mothers' Union banner in the corner of the church reminded me of a similar one which had a prominent position in the church I attended as a child - a church not disimilar to this one.The beautiful interior and east window.  Now that we attend a Methodist church in a \"modern\" building, I do miss the atmosphere that this kind of church has - I had a good fix of it on Monday.  It includes the slightly damp smell, the polish and the flowers.This arrangement was carefully constructed around a pillar and was quite striking.  There's the back of Uncle P in the background.The entrance gate with the sign over it.  My cousin was married in this church in 2005, and I have a lovely picture of her coming up the path with my girls behind her as part of the group of 5 bridesmaids which she had.  It was a February wedding so they wore raspberry pink dresses with velvet capes - they were gorgeous!I am now going to go and have a try at making scones.  I want to try Paul Hollywood's recipe from The Great British Bake-off but it isn't in the book (why ever not?).  I did, however, find it here.  I'll let you know later how they turn out!  Have a flick through all those links - saves me typing when I could be baking!!I'm back - they turned out really well but I had a moment when I panicked about the recipe.  Don't use the one from that link above as the quantity of milk is wrong.  Use this one!  This is from the BBC website and it works.  I will try to edit a photo in here later when we can sort the camera out - it takes the photos but has them trapped inside!I watched them disappear off down the street on their way to catch the bus - two girls in the same uniform with ponytails swinging as they walked, backpacks on and carrying PE kits.  The EFG is only just managing to maintain a few inches of height over the YFG so they are a similar height now.  We took photos this morning to mark the first day for them - Y10 for the EFG is the beginning of all her GCSE work, so I must not overlook the importance of the year for her too.  I have told them that today of all days, the answer, \"I forgot!\" is not acceptable when I ask them what they have been doing today - today, I need to know!Sincere thanks for all the good wishes - some here in comments and a few on Facebook too - thanks everyone.  The FH was impressed when I told him that people as far apart as Dorset and Forres were thinking of the girls today!"},
{"title": "End of an era tonight", "date": "Wednesday 1 September 2010", "text": "It feels like we are teetering on the brink of something here tonight!  The YFG has had a bath and gone to bed to study the plan of the school and try to learn it, she says, although she will be asleep by now.  I have just sat and sewn the last name tapes into her new uniform, and I have the camera at the ready to take photos in the morning.  Primary education is over now for us, and we are moving firmly into a different part of her life, and because she is the last one to move into this new time, we are all moving to a slightly different space.The EFG and the YFG don't get on terribly well, but the EFG has risen to the \"big sis\" challenge and made arrangements with her friends to take the YFG to her classroom when they get off the bus in the morning, and to be available for her at lunchtime for a short time if she is needed.  It's hard for the elder child as they have to go through all this on their own, but then they are expected to look after the younger child when the experience comes round to them - I was also the elder child so I have been in the position myself.  I'm proud of the EFG for her kindness towards her little sister in all of this transition.  I am sure that once she has the first few weeks under her belt, it will all become much easier for her.Today the EFG went to the cinema with her friend, and said friend's dad provided the transport.  When the YFG found out that there was a cinema trip in the offing but that it didn't include her, there was a little upset, so she and I and her friend went to see \"The Last Airbender\" this afternoon.  I saw it with the EFG on her birthday, and liked it then - and liked it more this time, so I was happy that we had gone back. I was able to take more notice of the soundtrack this time and I loved it! The poor lady on the ticket booth was rather flustered today and sold me three tickets to some 15 film, so I had to go and get a refund for that and sort the right ones out. When we returned home, I was delighted to find that the FH had spent the afternoon ironing and had nearly done it all! My hero - I had been dreading that heap for a while - there were a couple of weeks' worth of ironing there; now I just have to sort out whose is whose and put it in the bedrooms!"},

When they came back, they were skipping at T's house for a while until they returned for tea here at 8pm, playing here afterwards until 9pm when T's dad came to retrieve her for bedtime!  The EFG has had a similarly sociable day, disappearing to her friend T's house (different T, obviously) until they came back here to watch DVDs. T went home at about 6.30pm and all went quiet!!So, the FH and I have been in the garden most of the day.  We have put two new windows in to the new chicken shed, because a) it was a bit dark in there and b) we were given the windows!  One each side of the house has made a huge improvement to the amount of light in there, and I am so pleased with it all.  I have also watered the cucumbers with 4 buckets of water from my water butt, picked a load of tomatoes and distributed them around some of the neighbours as we still have most of the last picking to eat, cleaned out a section of the chicken house and put some young chicks in to a new house and run so that they have a little more room, pulled up the beetroot (aaaargh! must go and get them in!!) and trimmed a lot of shoots off the tomato plants so that the sun can ripen the tomatoes (I know, I know, its the warmth, not the sunlight, but they get warmer when the sun can actually shine on them, surely!?!). I have also been making some phone calls to people I needed to catch up with, and (whispers) I ordered a couple of books from Amazon - and I am now clued up to being able to earn Nectar points at Amazon - oh, the shame of all the points I have been missing out on! I am also earning Nectar points through searches on a toolbar - 50 a month - glad the new month starts tomorrow as I hit 50 a few days ago.Just washed the kitchen floor and need to go and fold some washing now, to get a head start on tomorrow - the very last day of the school holidays!!!!!!!"},

We went out at about 11am, heading north towards Wisbech.  We just made it to the outskirts of Wisbech when one of the children, travelling backwards in the boot seats of the Volvo, said she had a headache and felt a bit sick.  We stopped and moved them all around, then headed into the town to Asda to buy some Calpol.  I phoned their mum to make sure it was ok to give the Calpol, and then we gave her some and she actually perked up quite quickly, thank goodness.We got to Lutton St Nicholas church, which is over 600 years old, and had a good look around at all the lovely flower arrangements.  I took some photos of the flowers and of all the girls, but the photos are now trapped on the camera as the computer wants to reformat the card, which will delete the photos, so I will be taking it to the print shop in town later in the week in the hope that the amazing chap there can rescue them for me!!A picnic lunch was enjoyed on the grass verge where we parked the car down a lane at the side of the church, and some of the girls had a walk down the road in little groups.  When we went back to Asda on the way home, the YFG, EFG and I took a triplet each and we got along very well.  I have been very pleased with the way that we have adapted today to being a larger family and getting along - my own two daughters haven't hardly had a cross word all day as they have been engrossed in helping to give the other three a good time!  I can't say that I would want to be a mum to 5 girls every day, but it is great to be able to help a friend out now and again.  She has almost finished her decorating and is pleased with the progress she has made these past two days.Tomorrow I haven't got to get started so early as we only have one outing planned and that is roller skating at Downham Market at 4.30pm - the YFG and her friend are going.  I haven't warned her yet that the Canadian maple (I think that is what it is!) floor is going to be quite different to skate on compared with the pavement.  She is looking forward to going, and at 50p for an hour, I can't complain at the value for money!"},

There was a Cluedo tournament going on, some Scrabble, several Connect 4 championships, something new to me called Shut the Door, and lots of fun and laughter.  We all had some lunch at about 12 and then carried on until about 2.30pm.One of our church friends needed some time at home today to finish some decorating - she has had an extension built as a sort of granny annexe for her mother, and it is nearly finished.  She desperately needed to get the decorating done before Wednesday when she goes back to work at the school so I took charge of her triplets today at church, and then brought them back here afterwards until 5pm so that she could press on.  We are going to take them again tomorrow so I am going to be watching the weather forecast shortly so that I can decide what to do - with 5 girls in tow, it is going to be an interesting day - 3 nine year olds, an eleven year old and a 14 year old.....The YFG has been asleep on the sofa since 8pm so she must be super-tired, but we are not having too early a start in the morning as I am going to fetch the triplets at 10am. We may not go out immediately: we'll see how ready we are by then!!"},

The weather looked dubious to start with, and we helped to put up a fairly large gazebo (a Gala tent - sturdier than your average gazebo) so that we would have some shelter if it did rain, but the weather held off and some rather black clouds just blew over!  Then, later on, we saw a beautiful sunset as the sun sank amidst the few clouds scattered across a deep blue sky.   The YFG played tennis with some of the neighbours, and they both rode their bikes around with some of the other children on their go-karts, and generally had a lot of fun.  Someone brought along some fab luminous balloons, which were blown up later on, once the darkness had dropped in.Good memories made tonight."},
{"title": "Free range fun", "date": "Friday 27 August 2010", "text": "Leah and her four GPO offspring had a fun day out in the yard yesterday, exploring new territory for them!  They couldn't quite believe it when I opened the run up and let them out!Here's \"mum\" Leah - she's a grand old bird!Two of the chicks having a little disagreement over something one of them found in the grass - along the lines of, \"That's mine!\" \"I want some!\"Having a quick drinkWith a breeze ruffling her tail feathers, Leah poses in this shot.  Her 4 chicks are nearly as big as she is - and they will grow a lot bigger than her!There is a Nissen hut with a room set up like a dormitory for soldiers.  There are a couple of beds, and here (above) is one laid out for inspection, I believe.  Very tidy and precise!Now the sign did say \"Do Not Touch\" but she was fascinated when we told them that before computers, we had to use typewriters - and that they used to be \"manual\" before electric ones came along.Lots of tools in the workshop - the FH could identify some of them.The anvil - I hadn't seen one of these close up since I was at Gretna Green years ago!The forge - blacksmiths give demonstrations occasionally so this one really does get used now and again! Glad that they have the kettle at the ready for the tea.Real, old telephones.  We had two grey ones in my house when I was a child, and then my grandmother had one of the posher looking cream ones.  The girls were interested in how the exchange (below) worked - and the telephones work: four phones each had a number and could call one another - they ring the \"old fashioned way\".The telephone exchange - it was interesting to see all the bits whirring and clunking away as the calls we made from one phone to another were connected.The teacher's desk in the one-room school.The small woodburning stove in the corner of the schoolroom.Old fashioned desks with lift up lids. Each pair of desks are joined together.The FH has truly risen to the challenge today - a chain of events triggered one another: the enclosure of the verandah to make a conservatory means that the FH wanted to be able to open the French doors from the dining room/office.  That was hampered by the fact that the space in front of the doors was the only real space in the room for my big desk.......so I needed to alter the room around if he wanted the doors open.  I found a computer trolley in the Argos catalogue which I thought would do the job, so I suggested that he copy it for me.  It was £46, and he declared that he couldn't buy the wood for that so it would be more cost effective to buy it.  I didn't rush off to Argos, but let him think about it.  He thought commendably well, and decided to recycle an old TV stand that we acquired some years ago for free.  It is quite similar to the version in the catalogue and does the job really well - and considering that we were given the original, it was free!  £46 saved.....good result!Today the clouds have been in the sky, and they have occasionally been rather grey - but it hasn't rained all day!  The chicken runs were liberally strewn with straw today and the chooks have enjoyed scratching around all day outside.  I hope that tomorrow continues in the same vein and gives the ground a chance to dry out some more.I picked more French beans and tomatoes tonight, and we will have the beans tomorrow.  UJ has sent more plums - he came to my sister's house today so the FH nipped over there this evening to pick them up.  They have been de-stoned and are already in the freezer.  Lots of plum crumbles on the menu this winter, I hope.  UJ has also been making greengage jam and has kindly sent me a jar - it's my favourite, so I'll be hogging that!!We have had another complaint about our chimney today.  A letter from the council was awaiting us when we returned home at lunchtime - apparently someone on the estate has experienced a \"possible odour nuisance\".  If it wasn't so ridiculous it would be funny - we haven't had the fire alight since May, I believe, so why has this person waited so long to make a complaint?!?  The council rep I spoke to this afternoon is the same chap I dealt with over the last episode, and he has done the same thing: the complainant will have to keep a log over the next two weeks of every time they experience the nuisance and then he will act on it.  Trouble is, in late August and early September, I am unlikely to be lighting a fire, so they are not going to get much on their log.  The chap at the council is very reasonable, and so I am not afraid of this.  It makes me so angry that this person is wasting the council's time, money and resources over something so silly.  This time she has said that we are burning \"old pallets and painted wood\" - funny how that corresponds so well to a heap of pallets in the yard, and a uPVC window, which from a distance might look wooden as she will only be able to see a portion of it from her bedroom windows.  I doubt anyone else can see them because of where they are positioned."},

The F word was heard several times about the rabbits (they dug the holes which made the ground a bit bumpy), the pool (of course) and the chickens (he was helping me to herd a couple of them into their house).  After realising that he was OK, I couldn't do any more than stand there in hysterical laughter, tears rolling down my face!!  He had to come into the house, have a shower and get a change of clothes, poor man!!Today has been another rainy day here in East Anglia - the chickens' runs are now beginning to look like paddy fields, the grass is looking very lush indeed and the weather man tonight has said that today has been the coldest August day for 40 years. However, we haven't let it get us down.  This morning the YFG had a quick check up at the optician as her muscles are getting lazy in her eyes so he wanted to see if they were improving - she is supposed to have been doing some exercises to help them.  I knew little about this until last night - I asked him to explain them to me today so she will be doing them properly now.  We have to go back for another check up in 6 months, although sooner if the headaches come back.After a quick lunch, we all travelled to Burwell, about an hour away.  There is a museum of Fen-edge village life there; we have been there before but about 4 or 5 years ago with a home-education group.  It hasn't changed an awful lot, but I will blog about it properly tomorrow with some photos, I hope.Tomorrow is another busy day - shopping for trousers for the EFG, picking up her friend to come over for a couple of hours, picking up a gym folder from the HC, the YFG's friend (hopefully) coming for a sleepover, and me finishing the massive tidy-up of the office.  There's floor in here now!!  I also want to get a mountain of ironing done as well before the weekend..."},

It was like this in the last 9 or 10 weeks of each pregnancy - it seemed like it had been ages to wait, but the last few weeks sped past.  And now we are entering the last week of the school holiday, and the nerves and worry are beginning to show.  The YFG is more and more reluctant to go to bed each evening, finding things to watch on the TV - she is watching Evan Almighty right now - and I can remember the feeling: if I don't go to bed yet, tomorrow won't come so quickly.  I have the hindsight to realise that it comes just as fast, whatever time you go to bed, but she is young and doesn't have the years that I have, so I am letting her get through this the way she is choosing.  All my reassurances are not having an awful lot of impact, but I am just hoping that within the first half term, she will be able to settle in, make some new friends, find her way around and generally feel OK about secondary school.  She is definitely nervous, but kind of excited too.We have some fun things planned for this last week:Thursday - an afternoon at a museum near Cambridge in a village - we've been before and it is a great place to spend some time investigating as it is quite a \"hands-on\" museum - rare these days!Friday - her friend is coming for a sleepover and the EFG also has a friend coming for a few hours.Saturday - a community BBQ on the green.Sunday - a church outing to Ely, picnic and fun - pray for good weather for the weekend!!Monday - the usual band practiseTuesday - roller skating in Downham Market with a friend at the leisure centreWednesday - a day to relax and make sure everything is in place forThursday - our own personal D-day....."},
{"title": "Sunshine and showers", "date": "Monday 23 August 2010", "text": "Sunday was the day of the sunshine - what a lovely spell of weather we had yesterday!  After church, we came home and just relaxed for a while, before I got the washing machine into gear.  Wet weather had been forecast for this week so I knew that my best chance of getting the laundry dry was going to be yesterday, and I was right!  The machine churned nearly all day and I washed and dried about 4 loads of washing - it was all line-dried and now I have to get it ironed but that will be tomorrow's work.The YFG was a little fed up in the afternoon as all her friends were busy or out, so she put the paddling pool up, filled it with cold water and sat with her feet dangling into it, for about 2 - 3 hours in the afternoon.  Truth be told, she was tired, and an afternoon of chilling out like that was just what she needed.  By 6pm she had revived completely and was out on her bike on the estate with her friends, who had returned. UJ came to tea and I was delighted to be able to serve green French beans from the garden, picked and prepared in the afternoon.  The rhubarb cake was less successful as it overflowed from the tin I was trying to cook it in and flowed everywhere!  We had to take it out of the oven and decant it into a bigger tray - the grill pan! - and then it was OK to be eaten as a hot pudding with ice cream rather than as a dainty cake.  UJ brought greengages and Victoria plums - the greengages were stewed and then frozen whilst the Vics have gone straight into the freezer although I managed to keep a few back to eat fresh - they are gorgeous!Then it started to rain last night, and it seems to have rained all night.  The temperature dropped about 15 degrees today compared to yesterday, and it was much fresher this morning although the humidity built up again as the temperatures climbed through the day.  I looked out at the pool that the YFG had covered up and left out hopefully and it was hard to believe that it was just yesterday that she had sat out there in her pink swimsuit, towel over her head for a sunshade, feet dangling in the water!!Today, the EFG and I had dental appointments.  The EFG had to have some root canal work on a molar finished off, but I was lucky and was just booked in for a clean.  After that, the library and various stops around town kept us out and about until nearly 3pm.  The EFG was unable to go to her band practice tonight as she still had some numbness in her mouth and lips, but the YFG and FH went to theirs in the village - and I went along for the second hour to listen.  The teacher is very good and is making it a challenge for the YFG, but she is also very patient with the FH and his trombone.The chicks in the lounge are all doing well, and given that there are 16 of them in one box, I shall have to sort out a second box for them tomorrow and split them into two groups.  There is one that is definitely a Light Sussex, but the rest are GPO or Brown Sussex, I think."},

We have come such a long way since then....The YFG was at her sleepover last night, so we opened the EFG's presents quite quietly this morning and she was pleased to get all she asked for - a big pack of Sharpies, new CD, Remember Me DVD and her phone, to replace the one that got washed.  I took her to the cinema to see The Last Airbender - which was good, I have to say.  I was dubious, but I'd go to see the sequel if it is made.  We then hit Tesco to buy the ingredients for her birthday tea, and then came home and collapsed - she to read her new book that she bought yesterday and me to mull over the newspaper.  My legs were seriously aching from yesterday's walking, so I really wasn't up to doing much this afternoon!I made the tea quite late, and we ate at about 8pm, so we are now getting ready to head towards bed.  It's been a nice day, but the last few days have taken their toll on the YFG, what with yesterday's outing, the sleepover and then a swimming party today - she is exhausted!UJ has been away to Wiltshire for nearly a week, so he is coming over tomorrow to share his news and have some tea.  I think he will be bringing plums too - if they are the right kind, I may try to make some plum chutney as we have plenty of frozen plums already so it might be a good idea to try something new with this batch!!"},
{"title": "Chick success - again", "date": "Friday 20 August 2010", "text": "This is the biggest hatch so far - we have 15 chicks in the brooder box, and one further chick still fluffing up in the incubator!  All the 15 look healthy and are lovely and fluffy, so I am hoping that they all make it through to adulthood.That makes our total hatching of chicks about 40 this year - the most we have ever hatched ourselved in one year.  And it doesn't include the 4 GPOs that Leah has brought off as she has done that herself!No, it's not a football team, although it does sound like one!  The FH took the girls out yesterday, with the aim of going to Fakenham market, and then perhaps on to the coast.  They left here shortly before 10am and by 10.31am I had had a text from the EFG to the effect that they were \"sort of\" lost.  \"Dad doesn't really know where we are,\" she said, when I phoned to see what was going on.  He had taken them to Downham Market, and then thought he would head for Swaffham before turning north.  It didn't go according to his plan, but by some small miracle, they did end up in Fakenham by lunchtime!They pootled around the market, bought the wonderful and much preferred doughnuts from Morrisons, and then ate their lunch.  They moved on to Sheringham, went to Kelling Heath and then to Holt, where they bought old-fashioned sweets at the upmarket independent department store that is \"Bakers & Larners of Holt\" and then they came home.  I was relieved to get them home together!!  They reported that they had a lovely day, which pleased me.I spent the day at home - I dealt with the chickens, made a couple of loaves of french bread, some pizzas and a chocolate cake, tidied up, exercised, read a little, watered the garden, and generally plodded around here at my own speed - it was very peaceful.The teatime event was their friends, T & her brother G, coming for pizzas.  They stayed until about 9pm when I had to take them home in the car - they live just around the corner - less than 5 minutes walk but the rain was coming down so heavily and persistently that we would all have been drenched.  We were all ready for bed early last night.This morning, we took T & G and their mum and went to Cambridge to the Fitzwilliam Museum as they had never been there before.  The car was parked and we went in to the city on the Park and Ride bus - which my girls find a novelty as we don't use the buses out here in the wilderness as they never go where we need to be!  We had a fair walk from the bus station then to the museum, which made everyone hungry, so we had to stop for a snack when we got there.  After checking in our bags, we began the tour - there is so much to see there, we could have taken longer, but I think our legs would have given out!  The Egyptian rooms were first on the list, then the Greek and Roman exhibitions, before we went through to the pottery area and china exhibits - there was a pair of china chickens which I loved, and a chicken tureen as well - a huge chicken with babies on her back, and the whole thing opened up to serve the soup!!We saw a lot of art in the galleries, although none of us were impressed with the modern art.  There are two John Constable paintings which I did like - much more my sort of art.  Unfortunately the gallery where the Lowry is was closed, which disappointed me a little as I do find that amusing.  There were several paintings with women with exposed breasts which little boys find funny - and they weren't nude women, just women who had one hanging out in a slightly bizarre way!!After the museum, we nipped into the shopping area of the city before we headed back to the bus stop.  I went to Lakeland for loaf-tin liners and a few other bits, whilst the others browsed in Waterstone's - and some book purchases were made in there - although I did manage NOT to buy a cookery book which was some feat as they had a huge selection and I am sure I could have found one or two I liked!!The YFG has gone off to another sleepover tonight, and tomorrow will bring a cinema trip for me with the EFG for her birthday (14!!!) and the YFG has a birthday party at the swimming pool to look forward to with her friend from gymnastics."},

There are at least two more in the process of getting out of the shells.When this hatch is done, there are enough Light Sussex eggs to have a clutch of those in the incubator, and then that will be that for the hatching this year.  We have retired the Brown Sussex ladies to their \"nunnery\" for the next four months to rest and recuperate away from Lancelot, and the other ladies will be moving houses as soon as I get their all-female accommodation sorted out.  The BS ladies were the most urgently in need of a rest as Lancelot has become very amorous and one of them has hardly any feathers on her back at all - I shall be looking into a saddle for her for next season, I think.

The FH has been busy out there again today, and now he is up a ladder in the kitchen, swearing mildly about the people who installed the kitchen and put a plug in a socket and then installed trunking to the extractor fan, imprisoning the plug in its socket.  The fuse appears to have blown in the plug now, as the extractor fan has ceased to work, but it is going to be a Major job to uninstall all the stuff to get the plug out of the socket.......oh dear!The YFG went to a sleepover last night and only returned at lunchtime; the EFG went to an event in the village hall this afternoon and returned having made a sock puppet.  I took the YFG uniform shopping this afternoon, and we came back about £100 lighter of pocket.  I'm going to have to stop feeding her for a while so that the uniform fits for a year or two.  The EFG needed a new jumper and a new pair of PE shorts, so they were included as well.  We also bought some socks!  Now I think that all we need to do is visit the school shoe shop and we should be set.Plans for the rest of the week - the FH has decided to take the girls to Fakenham to have a poke around the market on Thursday, and I am hoping to go to Cambridge on Friday with them, to go to the Fitzwilliam Museum, a big favourite, so fingers crossed that it doesn't rain all day xxxxx.The latest hatch is due tomorrow in the big blue incubator - but there is a chick out already, cheeping away, sitting on top of some of the other eggs.

I woke early at 5.30 but noted the time and dropped off again - with the blissful feeling of being able to snuggle down for another couple of hours.  I eventually woke up and lay reading for another half an hour, before deciding that I really had to get up at 8.30 as the hens would be getting restless!!The girls had pancakes for breakfast for a treat, and then they packed the bedding away from where they had slept on the lounge floor, and they disappeared outside to play.  I pootled around for a couple of hours, doing odd jobs, and then at around 1.30pm, we went out to lunch in Huntingdon.  Unfortunately, I had lemonade and not a lot else as the pub chain has changed the menu and the safe salad I used to have there is no more.....I could have asked them to concoct it, as the ingredients were all there in other dishes, but I just wasn't that hungry.  We came home, and there was a torrential downpour this afternoon, so we watched from the verandah as the water fell out of the sky in stair-rods!  It has dried up now, but the ground was very muddy earlier on.  By 7pm, I was just getting into my stride - better late than never - and I cleaned out three chicken houses, and orchestrated some moving of chickens from one house to another: the second bunch of growers who were on the lawn are now in the chicken shed, with a run; the youngest group who were in the lounge are also in the chicken shed, but without outside access yet, as they are too young.  This means that all the pens in the shed are now in use - it is full up!! And the FH has got the electricity installed as well - so there is light!!"},

This week has been so much fun one way or another, but such hard work that I am glad that it is Friday night and I can flop out and not worry about going anywhere or doing anything at a particular time tomorrow - there is no schedule to follow and I can relax a little!Yesterday we had a Taster Session at gym for about 27 brand new kids, who just came along for an hour to see what we do and have a go.  It was good, but it was manic, and I got landed with all the really little kids - the 4 and 5 year olds.  They were seriously hard work, but quite rewarding to work with.  They have such short attention spans that they really kept me on my toes in order to keep them all engaged and listening.  About 15 of the kids' parents said that they would like to sign their kids up for the new term in September, so I count that as successful - and more people have been looking at the website these past two days than have ever looked at it before, so I guess that yesterday sparked some interest.Today has been the YFG's 11th birthday.  We took some cake and snacks to gym and had a little party at the end of the session, which was excellent.  The kids have been really well behaved all week, and they were brilliant today.  The YFG  asked for a new phone and an iPod for her birthday, which she has received, and I also added in a large bar of chocolate.  Her friends have given her stationery, nail varnish, Maltesers and lots of cards.  Relatives have sent her money, and our new neighbours very kindly gave her a giftcard for Tesco.  She has invited her friend, H, here for a sleepover tonight.  We were going to go to Sheringham tomorrow but the weather is dire at the moment and we didn't fancy mooching around Sheringham in the rain, so we have postponed that, and we are just going to go out for a meal together at a very reasonable restaurant in Huntingdon tomorrow.The EFG's birthday is next Saturday, so I've got to complete the shopping for that this week.  She also wants a new phone! The lawn is loving the rain as it is helping it to recover from all the really dry weather we had, but the rain is making the chicken runs very muddy - I expect it in November but not in August.  I'll have to do some digging tomorrow for them, and perhaps put some straw down as well to help them keep their feet a little more dry."},

This would be by way of a \"treat\" for the gymnasts as they don't often get the chance to use the big trampolines.  All was going well - we had the floor area prepared and moved on to setting out the trampolines.  I know nothing about trampolines and was just taking instruction from the HC and the Sports Centre Manager.  Then the HC lifted a bar and another part of a trampoline fell on to his foot.The air didn't turn blue, but I am sure he must have been thinking the words in his head, as he was clearly in a lot of pain.  A few minutes later he seemed to go into shock as he went very pale, clammy and sweaty, and looked as he would faint at any minute.  We got him sitting down, and after about 15 minutes, he recovered from that.  The pain in his foot was obviously still there, but he soldiered on and we began the session as the gymnasts had arrived by then.  He sat on a chair and gave instructions. Some time later, the SCM and I convinced him to let the SCM take him to the local minor injuries unit, where they diagnosed a couple of broken bones in his foot, plastered it with a basic plaster construction and made him an appointment at the hospital fracture clinic for tomorrow morning.  The SCM brought him back to the gym and I took him home after we had packed up at lunchtime.After all that drama, I was glad to get home at about 3pm for a sit down and a big mug of tea.  The EFG went to one of her friends' houses to watch a DVD, and the YFG went to another friend's to have a water fight - the temperature has been 27 degrees here this afternoon so she got her swimsuit out and had some fun.This evening has been band practise here, there and everywhere.  We came home and I have made the tea and will shortly be heading off to bed as I am quite tired tonight and my legs really ache!  I got caught out this morning as I did a different Davina DVD, one I hadn't done before, and it lasted 45 minutes instead of the usual 30, so that put me behind a little this morning, and I don't think I have caught up all day. Tomorrow I am going to have to ask the dentist for an emergency appointment for the YFG as she has chipped her tooth today somehow and is saying that it hurts!  Happy days - what will come next?!?"},
{"title": "Whoops!", "date": "Sunday 8 August 2010", "text": "One of the GPOs has put paid to the GPO breeding for the year today - she sneaked under the wire into the next-door run, had a rendezvous with the Silver Laced Wyandotte cockerel and then went back to her own cockerel's pen.......she'll be fertile by the SLW for a month, and although the FH saw the whole thing, he can't tell which GPO she was, so we will have keep any eggs from them from today onwards out of the incubators.  Ho Hum!  By the time the month is up, it'll be too late to incubate any more......I have been researching my Brussbar plans some more today, and boy, is it hard work!?!  Apparently, someone somewhere actually has a flock of these, but won't let any be sold.  I'm now wondering if I could at least find out who he is, then I could ask some advice. Apart from that, we have been to chapel this morning for the service to celebrate the Holiday Club.  We had a cake made with the Landlubbers logo on the top of it, and it was enjoyed by all the congregation after the service.  We also announced this morning that we will be having a chapel outing later in the month, and there was a positive response to that straight away.  It is only a picnic in a park at Ely, weather permitting, but I am sure we will all enjoy it.  Between now and then we'll just be praying for a nice, sunny day.The FH has been busy this afternoon, having a snooze, then doing some tidying up, and now watching James Bond in \"Live and Let Die\", one of his favourite Bond films.  He can't understand how I can read a book time and time again and still get something new from it each time, but he can watch re-runs of films time after time and still enjoy them.  I think it is because he often dozes off, so he probably catches a bit he missed last time, which keeps it fresh for him!!"},

The feathers have begun to change on the GPOs and I think that I have three cockerels and three hens.  It's a bit too soon for my novice eye to sort the Brown Sussex out just yet.You'd think these guys were posing for me but it is just a lucky shot of the five of them together like this.  These are the GPO parent stock, almost a year old now as they were hatched late last August.Here's my beautiful Lancelot, posing with a wife in the background.  He gets more lovely each day - and yes, I am soppy over a cockerel but he IS gorgeous - and so sensible!My \"new\" potting shed - interior above and exterior below.  The FH has worked hard for several days on this, and has done a grand job - we are both very pleased with how it has turned out.  The bikes and lawn mower will be going in there too.Cherry tomatoes are flourishing - we can't eat them fast enough - but they are delicious.The courgettes keep producing - and we are eating them daily.Some of the latest hatch, still living in the lounge - lamps are on only at night now.  This is the box we dowsed as female and there is Tarquetta, the blonde one.My American Vanilla Cupcakes, with their secret ingredient, courgettes!  From the Chocolate Heartache book by Harry someone or other - lovely cakes - bad for the diet though!!"},
{"title": "Rain in the Fens", "date": "Friday 6 August 2010", "text": "These are the pirates' \"Pieces of Eight\" some of which are hidden around the room each day for the teams to find and then arrange in the right order.  The children don't seem to realise that in doing so five times, they are actually learning a memory verse.  Philippians 3:8 is the verse around which the whole Holiday Club is centred.(click on the photo to enlarge so that you can read the verse on the coins)If it wasn't that the wind has been so warm today, one could have been forgiven for thinking that it was October already!  I really don't know where the summer has gone - the weather forecasters tell us that the \"summer\" we had in May and June was because the jetstream was being pushed north of us, allowing highs to come in, but now the jetstream has sunk to cover the UK, we are getting wet low after wet low off the Atlantic.  What's the betting that the new term in September will bring an Indian Summer again, and we'll all be basking in early Autumn sunshine.  My birthday is in September so maybe we can have a BBQ then!!The Landlubbers have had a busy day today, making a board game of their own invention based on a map of the island.  They made counters, and dice, and we laminated the maps to make them a little more durable.  There was much \"Heave-ho-ing\" and \"Yo-ho-ing\" too, games played, songs sung, prayers prayed, and the play applauded again.  The young actresses and actor are doing a grand job - some of them have even learned their lines.This afternoon, after a long lunch break, I had to go to town to pick up some new T-shirts for the coaches at gym, to retrieve my sewing machine from a friend who borrowed it to alter a dress, to return a packet of ham to Sainsbury's that had started to blow up (so we chucked the ham as instructed and just returned the packet for a refund, with the receipt) and to go to the library, where I have stocked up again.  I do seem to be getting through the books at a good rate - I wonder whether my late night reading sessions are having any bearing on my tiredness!?!On our return, I had a little nap!  It was then 7pm before I dispatched the girls to go and feed the hens and collect the eggs whilst I rustled up some instant food.  Some people would have had takeaway, but we do instant food on a night like this - Fray Bentos pie from a tin, Smash and beans!  Three meals for less than £2.50, and I ate leftovers from last night at lunchtime so I didn't want much myself so I've just had a cup of tea and a cake."},
{"title": "Pirates are getting weary!", "date": "Thursday 5 August 2010", "text": "One of the clues that the Landlubbers had to solve today - the YFG had great fun \"ageing\" the paper for me at the weekend.  There are several of these clues to solve each day.The Landlubbers are still having a lot of fun, but I have to say as one of the pirates in charge of the action, I am getting tired!! The daily routine doesn't leave much room for a sit down with a cup of tea to recuperate, and the children are very vociferous in their enjoyment of the holiday club!  I am very pleased at how well it is all going, but I will be very glad to go and have a bath and get to bed tonight.After lunch today I took the girls to Ely, which is some distance but a city we really love to visit.  There are some lovely shops there which we love to poke around in, shops that we don't have in our nearby towns - Wilkinsons and the Card Factory for stationery and writing stuff, a bigger WHSmith than we are used to, the market stalls, a great cycle and toy shop, Costas - we don't go in, but I do love to smell the coffee as we walk by!  We also made use of the trip to have a look at their Tesco and get the things on the list for this week - as well as some paint for the holiday club as we are running short.We came home from Ely to find that the FH had almost finished erecting the second-hand shed he was given the other week.  'Tis in need of some minor repairs, but he has it all under control, and has even built me a potting bench along one side.  The bikes and the lawn mower will be taking up the other side.  A friend got us some free felt (No, not off the back of a lorry!) for the roof, so that will be going on shortly and it will look very respectable.This evening we had some friends' children here whilst Mum worked and Dad played golf, except that they weren't here very long as Mum's client didn't turn up, which was very frustrating for her.  She's a holistic therapist, so people pay each time they come for treatment, but she has had a few people not turning up lately so she has had to start charging them for the missed slots, as she has had to heat her treatment room for them, put her time aside for the appointment and make arrangements for her children with me or her husband.  She is now phoning them and telling them that they have to pay half the cost of the treatment, which I think is more than fair.I've also had the sad news this week of the end of a friend's marriage - this has hit her out of the blue and her husband has moved out within just a couple of days of breaking the news to her.  She will clearly be in need of support from all her friends over the coming months.  It makes me so upset to hear of yet another relationship which has ended - one of my other friends had something similar happen to her just in May, but that was a mutual thing, so it was slightly different.  The FH and I have been together 18 years come October, and I count it as one of my greatest blessings."},

They would show you the joy on the children's faces as they were singing the songs, doing the actions, enjoying the craft activity, tucking into the Galley Rations, and working on the clues.  The club was a lot of fun this morning, and we have got everything prepared for tomorrow.  The church members who made this fantastic backdrop from a pair of old curtains and some emulsion paint should be getting a medal - it is a tremendous achievement.It'll just be a quick post tonight as there is still quite a bit to do around here tonight, so I'm off!"},
{"title": "Monday's musings", "date": "Monday 2 August 2010", "text": "We started out on a roll and have slowed down somewhat as the day has progressed.  I managed to get up, exercise, eat breakfast, feed chickens, water the garden, shower and be dressed and ready to go by 9.55am, with the kids only a step behind me.  We had to go to the chapel to put up the backdrops for the Holiday Club drama; the Holiday Club starts tomorrow, so it will be all systems go there for a week.After all that rushing, I slowed right down and almost stopped as I mulled the week ahead over and drank some tea.  The FH went to his art club this morning, so I had a little bit of an early lunch, and the girls fended for themselves - tomato soup was on their menu, apparently.  This afternoon, my early morning watering of the garden was proved unnecessary when we had a heck of a storm and torrents of water came out of the sky.  I put some extra buckets out and caught some of it for the cucumber plants, and the poor chickens all retreated in to the house.I strained the goose fat from yesterday's roast and I have it now in six sterilised jam jars, but it looks more like honey right now than goose fat.  The wisdom of other home-fat-producers says that this kind of home-produced goose fat will probably keep for 3-4 months, so we'll see - if only I could keep it till Christmas!  I bought some last year, and going on their prices, I've probably got about £30 worth of it.  Hoping that it will solidify.This evening, the YFG and FH went to the village band, and the EFG went to the band practise in the nearby town.  All are making progress.  I started on the shopping for the birthdays - the YFG has made her final decisions and so I have bought her iPod, engraved with her name, from the Apple store online - it should be here by Thursday, and then I got the phone she wanted from Argos tonight.  There was a little contretemps in the shop as the online price was £5 cheaper than the one that came up on the till, so the manager had to be called to override the till.  She did, so I was pleased.  I wouldn't have bought it otherwise, as the YFG is seriously pushing the budget for this birthday - those two items are it this year.  The EFG has less expensive tastes (but then she already has a phone and an iPod) so she wants a CD and a DVD, so far, but she has a week or so longer to go till her birthday.  Both will get cakes of their choice too.I have also been on the phone and the computer to arrange courses for the Head Coach and I for gym, and then to get an orthodontist appointment for the YFG and to change a hospital appointment for the EFG - I have already had to change that one once so the bookings lady was a little short with me.  Oh dear. I am so looking forward to September, not because the children will be back at school (hate that bit!) but because it symbolises a fresh beginning and I love those!  I'll be spending some time thinking in the holidays about what this fresh beginning is going to mean to us in the Fens."},
{"title": "Special Sundays", "date": "Sunday 1 August 2010", "text": "Just lately Sundays have been a day for entertaining visitors, and today has been no different: UJ has been here for tea, to share in roast goose.My fellow worship leader and I led the service at chapel this morning, and then we had a general chatting time of fellowship after the service as we usually do, so we were there until about 11.15am.  One of the older ladies needed a carrot cake recipe, and some eggs, so I photocopied my favourite recipe and nipped back up to the village with those for her.  I wonder what her cake turned out like as she was going to substitute the raisins for cherries - I am not sure about that flavour combination, but she only has herself to please, so perhaps she likes it.This afternoon, the FH and I sat in companionable silence for a while as I read another Annie Sanders book from the library and he had a snooze.  He had done a little work on the chicken emporium, but had had enough for one day.  UJ turned up at about 2.30pm with new potatoes, new carrots (I wish someone would bottle the smell of fresh dug new carrots!) and plums so the FH set to and prepped the plums for the freezer, scraped some potatoes and carrots for tea and peeled apples for apple sauce too.  We put the goose in the oven on a rack and had to empty the fat from the pan three times, as so much had drained from the goose as it was cooking.The YFG had a busy afternoon playing with various  friends from neighbouring houses, so I had to round her up at 7pm, and then we ate.  I don't think that I like goose so much that I would buy one, but having one donated made a nice change. The meat is quite strong and dark so it has a distinct flavour - but the girls cleared their plates, so they must have approved!  To follow, I made a treat: jam roly poly made with plum jam and served with soya cream.  That disappeared quite quickly!This evening, the FH, UJ and the YFG have watched the European Athletics and then The Transporter, whoever he is, and the EFG joined me in the conservatory to watch Sherlock.  I hadn't watched the first episode last week, and she begged me to watch it with her this week; I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is, but I couldn't help remembering the actor who played Dr Watson for his role in Love Actually - at least in Sherlock, he keeps his clothes on!!The hens must approve of their new house as the egg laying has improved considerably amongst the Light Sussex, but we must get the finishing touches in place as some of the pens are still short on perches, and the nest boxes have straw but really need some shavings in the bottom to give the eggs a softer landing as I have had a couple which are cracked at the end where they have been expelled onto the bottom of the nestbox.Birthdays are looming - the YFG next Friday and then the EFG the Saturday afterwards - present lists are beginning to appear!!"},
{"title": "Photo festival!", "date": "Saturday 31 July 2010", "text": "These two photos (above) show the two bigger runs coming out of the back of the new hen house.  The Light Sussex crew are in one of them and the young growers are in the other.  There have been a few little spats through the wire, but everyone seems to have settled in well.  The growers find the leap to get back into the house a little challenging but we have made the sliding door into a temporary ramp for them and that has solved the problem.These are the baby rabbits born to Alice (named after one of our favourite Twilight characters, Alice Cullen).  They are growing well, but we don't know how many of them there are just yet.  They are also in the shed in their hutch.This shows the interior of the shed - it is divided into 8 sections.  The little boxes on the floor are the nestboxes - the chooks can access them from their side of the wire and we can flip up the little lid and collect the eggs from our side.  The rug is covering a window so that the cockerels don't start crowing too early each morning - it is uncovered during the day to let the air through.Here are some of the runs on the front of the shed - to the left of the picture is the GPO run, then the SLWyandottes, then the Brown Sussex gang with Lancelot at the helm.  The far run on the right is for the three Gold Laced Orp cockerels and the young female.A melon growing in the greenhouse.Pepper plants, in the greenhouse again.Tomatoes in the greenhouse - a lovely variety I shall grow again called Garden Pearl.  We are having the most success this year with the cherry varieties such as this one, as well as Sweet Millions and Moneymaker.The neighbours are enjoying our cucumbers as much as we are - the three Telegraph and three Burpless plants are doing very well and producing loads!The cucumber plants do look a little like a Triffid attack in the greenhouse, though!!"},
{"title": "Moving house", "date": "Friday 30 July 2010", "text": "Tonight, in the rain, we have moved some of the mini flocks of chickens into their new house!  It is always easier to move them at night as they don't see very well, so they don't run around to get away from you and generally, you can just pick them off the perches and move them.  It worked OK and they are installed in the new house - there is the pen of Light Sussex, the Silver Laced Wyandotte pair, the Gold Partridge Orpingtons and four Gold Laced Orpingtons as well.  Another pen contains the 13 hatchlings which are now about 6 or 7 weeks old.  Lancelot, the Brown Sussex cockerel, and his three wives also took up residence tonight.  I'll be out there taking photos in the morning when they all come out into the runs!I am so disappointed tonight - I took some photos today and have just come to the computer and discovered that the memory card was still in the slot in the pc and has been there all day - so the photos I took today are stuck on the camera's memory as I don't have any way of getting them off it! Shame as they were some good ones too, so I will just have to try to redo them in the morning.This afternoon, I cleaned the lounge carpet with the \"free/donated\" Vax carpet cleaner.  It took an hour and a bit, but it has made a difference!  It didn't get every single mark out but it got a lot of general dirt out - the first time that carpet has been cleaned in six years, so there was some dust and dirt in there.  I did the stairs as well - quite a workout for me, especially as I had done the Davina workout beforehand!!I've been to the library today and picked up some Annie Sanders books ( I love \"Busy Woman needs a Wife\") and a couple of Jeffrey Archer novels as well. I wanted a Sidney Sheldon one called \"If tomorrow comes\" but it wasn't on the shelf, so I'll just keep checking for that - I had a copy years ago and loved to read it again and again, but it was given away in one of our housemoves, so I don't have it any longer!  I'm off to bed now with a cup of tea, to make a start on one of the books - don't know which one yet..."},
{"title": "Chicken shed", "date": "Thursday 29 July 2010", "text": "That title reminds me of the film called Chicken Run where all the hens are trying to escape!  I am hoping that our new chicken shed and runs are going to be escape-proof so that I don't have to keep chasing chickens around the garden.  The new shed is nearly finished so I will plan to take some photos tomorrow - I am really pleased with it.  The FH has been working really hard on it lately and it is all coming together at last.  I had to do some digging today in one of the new runs, and it was hard work, but it will be worth it when all the hens are moving in and I can enjoy watching them scratching and dust bathing in the dirt that I have dug for them.This afternoon we headed over to the big city and saw our old neighbour, her son and her mother, in the new flat they have moved to.  We miss them dreadfully here, and it was lovely to go to see the new place that they are renting now.  Her mother is over from Cyprus for a couple of weeks in the summer holiday, and she kindly brought the FH a real sponge from Cyprus to use for his art.  He was thrilled that she had remembered!  The girls spent some time with the little boy, playing on his Wii, whilst the adults were chatting.  It was good to know that they are safe and well, and living in a secure place.I am being tormented tonight by the sound of cheeping still coming from the white incubator - there really shouldn't still be anything viable in there, but I left it on for a couple of days after the last hatch as I usually do, just in case!  The cheeping started this afternoon, just after we got back, and so perhaps there will be another chick in the morning.  I reset the blue incubator with another 25 eggs last night.Before I set the eggs, I tried to dowse them!  I had never done it before on eggs - the FH can successfully dowse for water, but it was a new thing to us to try it on eggs.  I held my wedding ring suspended from a piece of cotton, over each egg in turn.  Some made the ring go around and around, and some made it swing back and forth.  Apparently, the first are male and the second are female, so we have marked each egg with the sex we believe that the chick could be, and when they hatch, we will have to try to get them so that we know which chick came out of which egg so that we can put different coloured rings on their legs, and then when the sex is distinguishable, we will know whether it works!!  The YFG had a go at some of them and mostly got the same sexes that I had achieved, so she was excited, too.  This could be very important for us in the long run if it turns out to be reliable, as it will save us hatching too many cockerels.  I read about it on the internet from someone who had had 88% right one year when he tried it.  That is pretty good going, I thought!"},
{"title": "Surprise!", "date": "Tuesday 27 July 2010", "text": "I came down this morning to find two chicks in the white incubator - I hadn't expected that.  The due date I had marked on the calendar had been and gone so I had just about given those eggs up as duds, when out popped these two gorgeous chicks.  Welcome to the world!!  They are probably GPOs I think - will have to count the other eggs and see what I have left.  There were six GPO eggs and six Brown Sussex in there.  Now that they have hatched, I am going to leave the incubator on for another few days and keep my fingers crossed that they have some more friends coming out soon.  The one cheeping in the blue incubator didn't make it out in the night, and may not do so at all now.  Hard times.Today has been one of those days - I am so tired I could sit here and fall asleep!!  I've done my exercise workout for the day: I did Bottom Fit yesterday and Top Fit today.  Yesterday was weigh day: I had lost a pound and a half, same as last week.  Overall that makes a total of 8lbs lost, so I received my \"half stone\" award sticker.  Makes all the sweating worthwhile - and I know I have lost inches too!!  Yay!!"},
{"title": "Laundry maid day", "date": "Monday 26 July 2010", "text": "In and out, up and down, the clothes went around in the washing machine and then I hung them out in between pootling around doing other things.  Much of it got dried but then the clouds came over and the last load of towels had to be hung under the verandah.  There's always tomorrow!!The FH and the girls went to their day of art at the village hall, only returning at 2.30pm with their portfolios.  The whole six hours until 4pm had proved to be too much for the YFG to handle and she was ready to come home that bit earlier.  The FH and EFG have both produced pictures but I have yet to see the YFG's work - perhaps she will show me in the morning. This evening the family has split up and gone two ways.  The FH took the YFG to a free band workshop in the chapel.  She used to play the cornet with the EFG in the town band, but then got fed up with it and gave up.  Something has sparked her interest again and the notice in the chapel at the weekend that there would be learning sessions for \"new\" players from 5-7pm on Mondays during the holidays soon had her asking if she could go.  She has thoroughly enjoyed it, apparently, has been given an instrument and is looking forward to returning next week. The EFG and I have been to the cinema to see \"Eclipse\" which we have both been looking forward to seeing for quite some time.  It was brilliant, and I will have to get it on DVD when it comes out so that I can sit and watch it again...and again!! The latest on the chicks is that the 11 are all doing well and that there is another chick in an egg in the incubator - it is cheeping and we can hear it but we can't tell exactly which egg it is in, and there is no sign of it trying to emerge yet.  I am hoping that it will make some progress overnight as it will soon wear itself out if it doesn't get out soon.Tomorrow I have to go and buy more chicken food!!!"},
{"title": "Reality check", "date": "Sunday 25 July 2010", "text": "One of the three that were fluffing up in the incubator has had to be dispatched this evening.  It was extremely unfortunate but not only were its feet deformed but there seemed to be no vent opening on its backside and part of its insides were protruding, a bit like a hernia, but there was nowhere for the faeces to be expelled.  A very sad moment.The remaining 11 are all healthy, eating and drinking well and snoozing now!  They are in the lounge under the lamp, awaiting any further brothers and sisters which may hatch overnight.  The other incubator's hatch is due tomorrow, so we will be hoping for some success there too.The weekend has passed in a bit of a blur.  The first BBQ yesterday was very much a girlie event, with the hostess and her daughter, another coach and her two girls and then me and mine.  Another two girls and one of their mothers joined us a little later, and there was much hilarity in the garden with table tennis, water fights and lots of games on the trampoline - and with 6 gymnasts in attendance, a little bit of showing off too!!The second BBQ was more of a family get together between us and our friends, the P family.  We went to their house and they had set up a lovely table in the back garden, where we all sat round chatting until quite late.  The children had a lot of fun together, and we stumbled home at around 10.45pm.This morning, the FH took the girls to church whilst I attacked the clean up!  My uncle, aunt, cousin and cousin's husband were here at about 2.15pm for a cuppa, and they had a good look around as it was the first time that my aunt and uncle had visited us at this house.  My aunt has had cancer treatment and it was a delight to see her looking so well.  My cousin is rushed off her feet with a beauty business and working as a dental nurse as well, so it was good for her to take an afternoon off; she does a lot of work with brides, so weekends are often very busy for her.They left just as our second set of guests arrived - the Head Coach, his wife and her mother.  We had a fun time with them, and they brought along some rather potent wine, so I got a tiny bit giggly later on!!  HC's mother-in-law is a wonderful older lady and she is such fun to be around, so we really enjoy her company.  She took a photo of my cousin's husband and said that she thought he could be her new toy-boy!!  We had a lovely meal outside in the conservatory together, and they left to take Alice home shortly before 8pm.Tomorrow the girls are going to Art class with the FH for the day, as the art teacher is running a special day from 10-4.  Unfortunately for me, the girls have been tidying their rooms, so my day tomorrow will consist of rebooting the washing machine at regular intervals as I struggle to wash all the stuff they have unearthed from their rooms.  Mind you, I have done my room as well and found a little to contribute to the heap as well, so I can't say that I am completely innocent!!Just a quick update - we have nine in the nursery box and three still drying out in the incubator.  No sign of any more coming out at the moment..."},
{"title": "New kids on the block", "date": "Saturday 24 July 2010", "text": "Five are out of the incubator already this morning, and into the nursery box.  There are more hatching still, so we will update when the hatch is finished.We think that the yellow one is a Light Sussex, but until the adult feathers come through, it is a bit difficult to tell; Light Sussex is definitely dad, but mum could have been one of five LS or a Sasso or a Buff Orp cross, so we'll need to watch and wait with this one.The others are GPOs and Brown Sussex - once they are out of the shell, it is hard to say who came out of which shell, so the feathering will sort them out as they grow!We were meant to be at the cinema this morning, but I don't feel up to going out at the moment, so the YFG has gone with our friends, and the EFG and I will go Monday or Tuesday.  The YFG joked that she wouldn't spoil it for us by telling us what happened, but we laughed and said that it wasn't a problem - we have read the book whereas she hasn't!!  Hoping that having a rest this morning and generally not rushing around will mean that I feel better for this afternoon's events."},

We are kicking off with a trip to the cinema to see \"Eclipse\" before we head home to go to a mid-afternoon BBQ at the home of the choreographer at gymnastics, along with some other gym friends.  Then, we have to come home and grab the FH to go to another BBQ at a friend's house in the village!  Must save some room for more food there!Sunday morning brings church - and then my aunt, uncle, cousin and her husband are all dropping in at about 2.30 for a cup of tea.  They live up past Wisbech so have a fair trek into this area of the Fens, but they aren't staying to tea, although they were invited, as they have to get back.  This will be the first time that this uncle and aunt have visited us in this house.  This uncle is UJ's brother.  Then at 4pm or so, A&K are coming to tea, and bringing the lovely Alice along with them for the evening, although they won't be staying late as K has to go back to work on Monday after her two week holiday, and they will be taking Alice home as well.So Saturday we are out and about, and Sunday people are coming here, but it is going to be a very social time for us all! In the blue incubator we have a chick pipping at the shell, so that may be out by morning as tomorrow is their due date - exciting!  The other ones in the white incubator are due soon after, so I shall have to get the nursery accommodation set up again."},

People are throwing money away - really!  A couple of Saturdays ago, the YFG picked up a discarded £20 note from the grass at the village show - just lying there, crumpled in the grass.  And now, just this afternoon, I picked up a fresh £10 note as we walked into Tesco.  I can't believe that people can be so cavalier with their cash as to drop that much money!!I'm off to make a donation to the Salvation Army in recognition of our good fortune these past few weeks.  It wouldn't feel right to keep it all to ourselves!!"},
{"title": "Holidays start here!", "date": "Wednesday 21 July 2010", "text": "The end of term has arrived! The girls are both tired after all the excitement of the end of term festivities; the YFG has had a fantastic time today in London.  She had never been to London before so she came home reeling off the list of all the things that she has seen today - the London Eye, Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament and the Thames, as well as Lee Mead in \"Wicked\".  Apparently, it was fantastic and they had seats in the front stalls so that they had a great view.  The coach arrived back in the village at 8pm so it was a long day, but they all enjoyed it.I picked the EFG up from school today at 3.20pm as she was chickening out of bus prefect duty this afternoon - her thoughts were that the kids were going to be \"manic\" as it was the end of term and they would be murder on the bus because they knew that it would be September before any prefect could report back to the school what they got up to.  \"Save me!\" were her words - I do think she is prone to exaggerate sometimes, but I see where she is coming from.  We went to the other town, to the shops and got a few bits, put my Premium Bond winnings in the bank and went to the library.  I have \"discovered\" a new favourite author to go on my list with Katie Fforde - she is called Jane Greene and I have read a couple of her books now and really liked them, so I found two more in the library.  Must go to the library more often in the holidays.One of the rabbits had some babies today - she made two nests in her house, so there must be a few of them.  We have moved her hutch into the new chicken house as it has a peculiar roof and there is a lot of rain forecast so I wanted to keep them dry.  Hope she likes it in there!"},
{"title": "Catch up with all the news!", "date": "Tuesday 20 July 2010", "text": "We are fast approaching the end of term here in the Fens, and there has been a lot going on!Saturday was the last gymnastics session, and it went really well. By the time I had been to Tesco and done the shopping, I was ready to collapse. It was a very full-on kind of day, and I also had in the back of my mind that I was helping to deliver the Sunday service and needed to get some things ready for that.Sunday morning, we took the service and were pleased and relieved at how well it was received. We have to do another one a week on Sunday, and then again on the 31st August, so we are getting plenty of practise in. After that, I cooked the Sunday roast, and we enjoyed that. After clearing up, I took the YFG to the local RSPCA centre where they were having an open day. It was huge and there was loads to look at and do. The EFG preferred to stay at home and snooze! When we came home, it was time to get things ready for tea, as we had visitors coming. We planned a traditional Sunday tea, with sandwiches, sausage rolls, mini pork pies, crisps, and then cake and pavlova. There were eight of us all together and we had a good afternoon and evening chatting together until the guests left at about 9pm.Yesterday, on Monday, the EFG felt sick at school, so we had to go on a mercy dash to fetch her home at about 1pm. Luckily she was never sick and returned to school today. Monday seemed to fly past - after school, the YFG took part in a school talent show with two of her friends - she and T were the backing singers, and the other girl did the most - that girl was fantastic! And they won!! Later on, it was weigh in day at Slimming World and the good news is that I lost another pound and a half. I had been hoping for two, but I'm not complaining. As the FH reminded me yesterday, all the exercise I am doing will mean that I am hopefully building a bit of muscle, so it will be more important to take my measurements often than to take too much notice of the scales.Today, I went to school this afternoon for the Leavers' Assembly. It was great fun as the children in Y6 including the YFG acted out sketches of events that had happened in each year of their primary school careers. It was hilarious in parts, and they had a lot of fun putting it together. They also sang, \"I did it my way\" except that they changed it to \"We did it our way\" and they did!! The Headmistress gave them each a Certificate of Achievement - the YFG's says hers is for her enthusiasm for learning. The local Rotarians presented each child with a lovely dictionary, and they also gave a couple of prizes; a boy and a girl each received an award for service to the school and community. There was a cup for a child who overcame a problem to achieve at school - the deaf child was given that. Then there were also a pair of boy and girl's cups for progress across the child's school career - and the YFG was the proud recipient of the girl's cup!! She was a little disappointed to hear that she has to give it back after a year, but we'll take a photo of her with it so she can remember it all.Tonight the YFG has been preparing two packed meals for her trip to London tomorrow as her class is off to the Apollo theatre to see \"Wicked\" and they are all really excited!The EFG's end of term has been a little quieter as she is not leaving one school and moving to another - she is moving from KS3 to KS4 though. Her GCSEs begin in earnest in September and she has already been set homework for the holidays to prepare work for the Art and Design course. She has been nominated in 14 subjects for a Certificate of Effort and Progress - again! This brings with it a £5 WHSmith voucher, so she has kindly donated it to the funds as she recognised that I am going to have to buy her a lot of art materials, so she thought it would be good to put the voucher towards some of it all.Tonight I had a major fright when I was out doing the rounds, shutting up the chickens. I could hear what sounded like heavy breathing or snuffling in the lavender hedge behind the \"orchard\" of fruit trees. I couldn't imagine what it was at all - I wondered if it was a fox that had got into the garden and couldn't find its way out again...whatever it was, I dashed back into the house, slamming the door behind me and told the FH he had got to come an investigate! Being my hero, he came out and wielded the torch in that area. He soon found the culprits - two hedgehogs sniffing round each other!! They were really making a lot of noise, just sniffing each other, nose to nose, as if they had just met and were sizing each other up. We are hoping that they might be Mr and Mrs and that there might be little ones in the offing!"},

Don't get excited - I'm not a millionaire - but I am £25 richer!!  That was a lovely surprise.One of our Dutch bantams, Leah, has successfully brought 4 GPO chicks off the nest this morning.  She had 5 eggs, so she has done well.  We have only glimpsed them briefly, but they are all looking hale and healthy.The other Dutch bantam, Lana, is currently sitting on four duck eggs, so I am not sure what she will think when they come off - \"What have I done?!\" springs to mind!  They take an extra week to hatch, but I know she has the patience to wait a little longer than usual.I will take some photos when Leah brings her brood out to the grass in a day or two.  The first big hatch are looking gorgeous now, the second hatch are out on the grass during the day but being brought in at night, and the incubators are still warming the latest lots of eggs - they are due on the 24th from one incubator and the 26th from the other so we have a while to go on both of those yet."},
{"title": "Thunderstorms today", "date": "Wednesday 14 July 2010", "text": "The latest hatch were enjoying their first day out in the big wide world, pecking away at the grass in their run.  They were able to hear their bigger brothers and sisters nearby, but couldn't see them.  There was no shelter in their run as it was a temporary idea, and they were coming back into their box for the night.  We were sitting in the verandah enjoying a cup of tea, and then the heavens really opened - all of a sudden, there were torrents of rain - on my poor little chicks!!  I went dashing out there with covers to put over the run to protect them and I ended up looking like a drowned rat!!!!  Had to get changed it was so bad.After the deluge, the sun reappeared, which was good, as I think they needed a little sunshine to dry them off.  We ate our supper out under the verandah tonight, which was lovely.  The chicks are now safely tucked up for the night, and I am just going out to do my rounds of all the others.I have been pleased at how easily I have found half an hour to do the exercises each day: instead of feeding the chickens after I have dropped the YFG off at school, I go out and do them at 8am once I have done the lunchboxes and made sure she has breakfast on the go. The EFG leaves at 7.55am so I know she is ready and off.  The chickens take me about 15 - 20 minutes at that time of the day, so I am back in the house by 8.20, usually still in PJs, so that is when I rush upstairs and put on some exercise clothes and stick my hair up in a ponytail, and clean my teeth.  We leave for school at 8.35am, and I am usually home by 8.45 at the latest - and as soon as I walk back in the door, it is exercise time!  I'm done by 9.20, and then I hit the shower and get ready for the rest of the day.It doesn't work as smoothly as that on days when I need to be somewhere early, but I can juggle it around a little.  And for the summer holidays when the kids are lounging around a little more, I will just be doing it a bit earlier, before they surface in the mornings!!  Any rude comments, and they will be banished from the lounge or made to join in....."},

First the EFG with her middle toe - that was last week's visit to the doctor, and now the YFG has something similar festering at the side of her big toe.  We are soaking it in salty water, putting teatree oil on it for disinfection purposes, and using the cream that big sis got for her toe too.  If it isn't any better tomorrow, there'll have to be another trip to see Dr someone or other, depending on who is available.Gym tonight has been interesting.  The Head Coach went on holiday to Malta tonight so I'm in charge this week and it is both a little daunting and quite exciting.  A helper, an Assistant Coach and I managed the two classes tonight, and we had fun.  Setting all the equipment out was not so much fun, but I had done most of it before anyone else got there and it was just the bits I couldn't manage on my own that I had to leave till the cavalry arrived.The weather's being interesting - a drop of 12 degrees in daytime temperatures mean that it is so much more comfortable for doing things outside!  And the rain is good for my parched lawn - I don't water grass, so it has been a little yellowed of late but it'll recover....or die.  Tough love!I managed to do most of the \"Bottom Fit\" section on the Davina DVD this morning - it was hard work, though, and my legs ached afterwards, and the sweat - I was dripping!  200 squats in a sequence in the middle of it just about did me in completely but I had a little break here and there by just marching or jogging on the spot when I absolutely couldn't go on.  I'll improve as I practise it, I hope - and the set of weights arrived, so I am going to do \"Top Fit\" tomorrow so that I can try them out.Sending huge hugs out to Dorset to GTM whose cat is missing - a terrible worry for her.

Amazing.....won't be that dramatic next week, but I will be keeping up with the exercise and good eating plan, and hoping to lose two pounds to get to half a stone off.I had a call this afternoon on our landline from a mobile phone company representative who was calling from \"3\". He started asking me whether I had a PAYG phone and then how much credit I bought each month.  I knew what he was up to, planning to get me to take out a contract with that company, so I hammed it up a little!! I told him that I use about £20 worth of credit every six months (that's not so far off the mark, actually, but I do spend a little more than that) and he laughed!!! He had the cheek to laugh, and then he asked me about the kids, as he knew that there are kids in the house as one of them answered the phone and said that they would pass the phone to \"Mum\".  He said that he was sure that the kids used their phones more than that, and I told him (tongue firmly in cheek) that no, they used a lot less than that as we all use mobile phones for emergencies only \"and we don't have many of those\" and the silly chap laughed again. So I told him off!!  I got on my high horse and ranted that it was because there are so many people wasting their money on rubbish like mobile phones that this country is in so much debt, to which he replied that the country is not in debt.  I advised him to learn a bit more about politics and watch the news more often so he knew more about what he was talking about, and then concluded that we were both wasting our time continuing with the conversation and hung up.  My friend, D, then burst out laughing, so I joined her, and we had a good laugh at him. People like him have it tough.  He is only doing his job, and he wants to do it well to sign up as many new customers as possible so that he keeps his job, which is important in a difficult economic period like this.  I do understand that - BUT he laughed at me for being careful with my finances, and I will not have that."},

Weigh day at Slimming World is tomorrow so I will be hoping that it has all done some good!!  A spot of gardening now and again and some walking about also counts towards some activity merits, so that's even better.  And I have tummy muscles....they ache some days, and I haven't even tried the \"Bottom Fit\" workout yet - the \"Top Fit\" involves weights, so I have ordered some from Amazon - until they get here I am using cans of grapefruit and being very careful not to lob them through the TV!!  I think I will watch the bottom one this week and see how bad it looks - may have to psych myself up to it.And boy, didn't it go quickly!  I can't remember half of the stuff we got up to but obviously I didn't spend too much time on here..sorry! There was the trip to the doctor with the ingrown toenail with the EFG - middle toe, which was sore - that was Friday morning.  The YFG brought home a rather fab school report which I was thrilled with.  Considering she's only been in school three years and is now about to go to secondary school, she has done incredibly well.  There was also the trip to the school play on Wednesday which UJ came to as well - it was a modern take on Noah's Ark, from the parrot's point of view - rather fun.  Saturday saw the YFG on the Gala Queen's float as a princess - posh frock, new shoes, tiara, fancy hair do AND mascara....the day was SO hot, but it was fab.  I got home from gym, quick shower and up to the field, but she had taken her finery off by then - there are some lovely photos though so I haven't missed out completely.  UJ stayed last evening for a meal under the gazebo in the garden, so that was fun too.Next week - last week of gym before the holidays and only a week and half of school to go too!!!We are looking forward to the summer holidays - yay!"},

There is no way I am publishing comments I can't read - I have no idea what on earth they say!!  Then I got one today where the comment was in English, but signed by those characters again - presumably they could represent someone's name, but I won't publish something I don't understand as it could say anything!The wonderful is surviving my first day on the Slimming World healthy eating plan, without going too wrong.  It has changed so much since the last time I used it (hence the size of my backside!) and there is quite a lot to get my head round...I had hit my heaviest un-pregnant weight again, and decided that enough was enough - I'll be 40 in two years and I am not going to be fat as well as 40!!  I have also done half an hour's exercise to a Davina DVD today, so that is more than wonderful, that's more like a minor miracle, especially as I have done it for two days in a row.  Davina says that you should do it three times a week, but I can't do it like that - I need to do it every day (or just have weekends off, perhaps, when it is going to be difficult to get the privacy in the lounge!!) as I would keep saying, \"Oh, I'll do that tomorrow..\" and we all know that tomorrow never comes!

{"title": "Weekend news", "date": "Sunday 4 July 2010", "text": "Yesterday just seemed to go on and on, and by the evening, I would have been happy to declare that the things I had done in the morning had happened on Friday, so long ago did it seem! We did gym first thing, starting with the Tots group at 9.30am and that went really well.  Sometimes the kiddywinks are losing interest too soon and they just seem to have no attention span at all - and then I keep looking at the clock, desperate to get to the end!  Yesterday was totally different and went much better - we must be doing something right. After that group, we had development and competition girls - 6 of each - and boys - 7 of those, I think.  The boys only stay for an hour, and then the girls really went to town.  The development girls were working on some new things, which they really enjoyed and had a good go at all of them.  The comp girls were all working on beam and bar routines, and we were having a laugh explaining the need for \"oomph!\" in the routines - they need to have an air of \"look at me!\" about them, rather than performing in a solid manner but without pizzaz!  We worked on the oomph and pizzaz with all the girls.After gym, we hit Tesco and the YFG went off with the shopping list and a trolley and did the bare minimum weekly shop (must have a count up and see how much of the £100 we have left!) and I went for a wander to see if there were any bargains to be had - and found one!  School shirts - boring but a must-have.  The secondary school is a shirt-and-tie school, so the YFG needed new shirts with collars that close together, and the EFG could use a couple of extra ones, so I was pleased to find a three-for-two offer on shirts - two packs for the YFG and one for the EFG.  I also needed to buy the FH some paint for his art lesson tomorrow as the YFG had helped herself to some of his when she had made the model fire engine a few weeks ago.We got home and had something to eat, mooched for a while, got changed, hung washing out, and pottered in the garden until the FH and EFG came home later on.  I also went to see my friend around the corner for an hour, and eventually came home and made the tea at about 8pm.  After tea the FH and I watched some tv and I gave up and went to bed at about 11.  A long but good day!The YFG came blundering into our room to wake me at about 3am after being sick in her bed.  Cue drama and I had to dash for a bowl, clean her and the bed up, and then try to get her settled down again on a crudely made bed.  At that point, I removed my alarms that had been set on my phone to get us up for church and decided that we all needed the sleep!The YFG was absolutely fine this morning, thank goodness.  She badgered the FH to take her to the local car boot sale, which he did, and was glad he did as he found an enamel plate which he has been wanting for art, and at only 50p it was a bargain.  We had a snack lunch and then the FH took both girls to town as the EFG was playing her cornet in a band performance at the bandstand in the park. This evening, UJ had come over with beetroot, fresh peas and other goodies from the garden so we are being spoilt.  We have had fresh lettuce and cucumber from our garden with our tea tonight - this is the life - lots of fresh from the garden produce - plot to plate in 10 yards just can't be beaten!!"},
{"title": "Swings and roundabouts", "date": "Thursday 1 July 2010", "text": "The YFG burst in from school at 4pm with a bit of a miserable face and my heart sank!  Happily, though, that was just about the routine for getting back on the bus this afternoon - apparently one has to run to get a seat near a friend!  She got home safe which was all that mattered to me.The day has been interesting - she has had various classes: technology, art and English, from what I can remember, as well as PE and a period with the form tutor.  Those went well and she got around the school OK, with some help.  What was the slight downer for her was that she has been put into a form/tutor group without any other children from the primary school here.We received a letter on Tuesday telling us the tutor groups, and then she spent most of yesterday asking everyone which form they were in, and came home wailing that no one else was in hers.  I had to go to a school meeting last night so I mentioned it to her teacher here, who told me that she had been promised by the transition team that the 17 children from the village school would be spread evenly across the 7 tutor groups - not difficult: 4x2 and 3x3 surely?  So I confidently explained to her last night that she would get there this morning and it would become apparent who was there from the village.  Somebody somewhere made a \"whoops!\" because she was right though - she was alone in the tutor group.....This is not such a big deal to me as it seems to her, because she can't really yet understand how different subjects are taught in secondary school and how your friend A who is in your Maths class might not be in your English or Science classes.  It turns out that they would only spend about 20% of their time in that tutor group and she may well be in English/Science/Maths groups without anyone else from the village so she may have to just smile and dive right in to making some new friends.  She is generally a friendly and popular sort of girl so I think that she will be fine once she has made a few new friends.She has been interested to see how many of the teachers have said, \"Oh, you're X's sister, aren't you?!\" and there have been quite a few.  The EFG has a good reputation in the school, and the YFG is in the shadow of that, to some extent, so she is going to have to stand up and say, metaphorically speaking, that she is her own person and not actually that much like the YFG in many things - she's polite and well behaved, but not necessarily interested in or good at the same things, so the English teacher may have her expectations dashed whilst the PE teachers may be pleasantly surprised at her enthusiasm - the YFG does it, but not with much aplomb!I have had an interesting day and made some unexpected contacts and discoveries but that's another story!The EFG has taken the YFG to the bus stop and they will just be getting on the bus now - the bus doesn't actually leave the village for another 15 minutes as it has a lot of little pickups to do, but she is on her way to her first taste of secondary school!!  They were both up shortly after 6 this morning, and I remember the FH saying at some point that the YFG seemed to be ready to go and it was only half past six, to which I muttered that I wasn't getting up until 7am!  For the last half hour before they left, she kept looking at her watch and asking how long until they could go - I detect an air of anticipation and excitement!! I hope the day lives up to her expectations...."},

Long may she continue...The weather continues to be hot and bothersome.  I am not someone who enjoys this heat, as I would prefer to turn the thermostat on the county down a notch or two to a more comfortable level.  I am probably one of those people who prefer colder weather as I do find it easier to get warm than to cool down!  At this time of night, I have a cake in the oven as it would have been unbearable to have had the oven on during the day and been busy in the kitchen at the same time.   I am making this chocolate brownie recipe, as recommended by Sue at The Quince Tree.Today I have spent at gym, as the school where we train has been hosting a sports festival for all the Y6 children who will be moving up in September.  We did four sessions of gymnastics, all at quite a basic level, but we identified a few potential gymnasts, and also welcomed some children we knew who have stopped coming to the club for one reason or another but who were part of the Y6 group moving up this year.The YFG is off to her new secondary school for the day tomorrow and she is rather excited!

The weather has been so glorious these past few days that I have not wanted to be at the desk.The big news here is that the latest hatching has happened now - 15 chicks are in a box under a lamp and growing fast.  There are 8 Brown Sussex - so Lancelot is probably doing his stuff after all. Five of the eggs didn't hatch, but 62% is an improvement so I am not complaining about that.  Five are Barred Plymouth Rock - they are from the 12 eggs I bought, and blogged about my anger at receiving such old eggs.  As I suspected, the older eggs were the ones which didn't hatch.  One of the chicks is a little blonde one who is also a Brown Sussex, but from a set of six eggs I bought in to develop another strain of BS for my breeding programme.  One out of six isn't good.  And the last chick is a Silver Laced Wyandotte from my own pair.  Overall, I am pleased with what I have hatched, but a lot of the eggs haven't hatched - there is an incubator on which I am giving up today from which the SLW hatched - it was the only egg to hatch from 14.So, what do I think is going wrong?  The difficult thing is that I just don't know!  The 8 BS were hatched in one of my very basic polystyrene box incubators which cost £25 from eBay - that incubator has a good track record.  The other less successful incubator which hatched the SLW was more successful with its last hatch, so what has changed since then is a mystery.  The BPR and second strain of BS hatched in the new, automatic incubator - but 6 out of 18 eggs is hardly a rip-roaring success.  I do think that the age of the eggs was against some of them, but I had higher hopes for the BS in there.There are more due later in the week in a third poly box, so we'll have to watch and wait.  Very frustrating overall!Other news is that the YFG will be going off on the bus to her new secondary school for a transition day on Thursday - she is excited and nervous at the same time.  So am I, on her behalf, but her big sister is doing well there and so I am reassured that I can trust the school to do a good job.  It is not an \"outstanding\" school in OFSTED terms, but it is a good, solid school which is not afraid to admit that it has some problems and explains how it is dealing with them, rather than refusing to admit that they are there.  The EFG has done exceptionally well there, and will be starting her GCSE work in September so we have good expectations for both of them.The garden is producing well - we are eating the lettuces, the first courgette has been picked, lots of strawberries have been enjoyed and the beans are racing up the poles!"},

The bad news is that the Silver Laced Wyandotte (SLW) we set on eggs last night has lost the plot.  She doesn't seem to grasp that she has to sit ON the eggs in order to hatch them.  When I checked on her this morning, the eggs were in one area of the cage and she was in a nest, further back, looking at them.....I removed them.  The other broody, Leah, is an old hand, having done it all before, so she knows the score and is sitting well already, fiercely protective of her eggs.I cheated this morning and called in at Delfland Nurseries, where they raise organic plug plants for the trade, but also have a small retail outlet for locals, and I bought 15 butterhead lettuce plugs at 10p each.  I just never got round to sowing the next batch of seed in time, and we are eating the lettuces quite quickly so this is a way of keeping up with demand until I get in gear with the seeds.  Gardening is definitely on the agenda for Sunday!"},
{"title": "More ladies in waiting", "date": "Thursday 24 June 2010", "text": "Tonight we have put eggs under two more broodies - one is a Dutch bantam called Leah, who is now sitting on 5 GPO eggs, and the other is the Silver Laced Wyandotte hen, who has been given 6 eggs of assorted origin.  They are tucked up on their nests tonight, and we will be hoping for more success in three weeks' time.  The current broody Light Sussex has only days to wait before she pops but she has already rejected two of the eggs, so there will be a maximum of 6 left to hatch.  'Tis her first time, and I don't think she is sitting on the eggs very well as you can occasionally see odd eggs peeking out from under her feathers.The YFG has had her sports day at school this morning and came home delighted to report that althgough she didn't win any races, she did manage several second and third places, so a big round of applause for her.  The weather has been much more comfortable here today with some breezes and even the odd cloud. After school, we nipped quickly to town to pick up the EFG and then went to the other town to the supermarket as I needed some Quark to make a cheesecake.  The recipe hasn't arrived yet from my sister, so I am not sure what I am going to do with the Quark, but hopefully I'll find out in the morning.  I did ask her for the recipe two weeks ago, and had hoped to do a dummy run at it before I have to make it for \"company\" so think of me tomorrow making this!  I have to provide a strawberry dessert for the church Strawberry tea on Saturday and tomorrow will be my only opportunity to make it!The chicks enjoying their breakfast in the early morning sunshineThey seem to be enjoying the great outdoors!The two groups of birds have integrated well although they did gather together in their original groups to sleep last night.  One group went into the house we provided, the other group preferred to sleep under the stars.They have got plenty of space to move around now, lots of scratching opportunities too!This unusual dish is being used for their water at the moment - they like to perch on it too.Having a chat at the watering hole - two Brown Sussex birds."},
{"title": "Strawberry surprise", "date": "Wednesday 23 June 2010", "text": "I said a while back that the strawberry bed was full of grass and weeds - it is also chock-full of beautiful berries hiding in the undergrowth!!  I pulled two and three quarter pounds of succulent berries tonight - I got stung in the process, but they are gorgeous, and the YFG has already asked for some for her snack tomorrow and the FH has pilfered some too!Today has been hot, hot, hot!  I spent an hour watching tv during the hottest part of the day, and pottered around inside as well as it was just too hot to be working outside.  Unfortunately, I lost my Sutherland kale seedlings to the heat yesterday, so I need to sow some more - I was really disappointed about that when I discovered them this morning.  I was up early to get the hose pipe out in the greenhouse, but I think that I need to be earlier tomorrow.  The cucumbers will be hitting the greenhouse roof within days if they continue at their current rate of growth and there are lots of tiny cucumbers growing on their stems.The 6 GPO chicks and 7 Brown Sussex chicks are now in a run on the lawn in the back garden.  It seems very early to be putting them out, at nearly three weeks old, but they have been off the heat for over a week now, and all seem fit and strong.  The one with the bad foot has totally integrated into the mini flock now, thank goodness, so I am really pleased about that. The YFG has Sports Day in the morning so we will be getting her organised with plenty of water, sunscreen and a hat for that.  There is little shade on the school field, so this year it has been organised to take place first thing in the morning, so I hope that it will all be over before the temperatures peak."},
{"title": "Budget blues", "date": "Tuesday 22 June 2010", "text": "Was I moaning about the weather the other day?  Rain, wind and chills?  Now we have gone completely in the other direction and we are perspiring sitting still!  The YFG went to an athletics day for an intervillage festival today and came home as red as a beetroot and far too hot and bothered to contemplate going to gym, so I went alone whilst she had a cool swish in the bath, watched tv and then cleaned the lounge.  I owe her one! Today the YFG helped me with two other gymnasts at her school to present Assembly all about gym.  I broke the ice at the beginning by telling them all that \"gymnastics\" comes from a Greek word, gymnos, which means \"naked\" because originally it was done in the nude!  They all had a chuckle at that!!  It was fun and the three of them were good helpers - and the teacher in charge of the assembly gave them two merit points each, which pleased them.This afternoon, I watched George Osborne present the new Budget to Parliament.  I took notes, and I think that the only measures which will affect us in a big way will be the hike in VAT in January, and the freeze on Child Benefit.  I don't earn enough to benefit from the increased personal allowance, and the FH might only possibly be affected because of his age anyway.  I think that the other changes will affect us all in some way or another, but in a less obvious way - we'll have to wait until it all trickles through to daily life and then assess the impact it has on us.  I don't see any change to our moneysaving way of life!  As far as VAT goes, if we plan to make any big purchases, we will think about making them this side of 4/1/11."},
{"title": "Shopping here and dashing there", "date": "Sunday 20 June 2010", "text": "The FH was pleasantly surprised this morning with his stash of Father's Day gifts - shaving foam and after-shave balm, Maltesers and a Rum truffle log bought from a hand-made chocolate stall at the show on Friday.  I think he had forgotten all about Father's Day, so when we presented him with a goody bag just before church, he was pleased!  He used the balm immediately, hoping to wow the ladies at church... I rang my dad this evening, and he is fine.After church, I had plans.  They included weeding, hanging washing, reading, snoozing a little, ironing...that sort of thing.  Instead, we nipped off to Peterborough (twice in one week!!) to get the shoes for the YFG to wear with her dress and tiara on the float at the festival next month.  We had directions to a particular shop, Kempston's, near Asda on Viersen Platz, so we went there.  Unfortunately, the sandals that the YFG wanted were not wide enough for her feet, but we did get a lovely pair of sparkly silver slip-ons, for only £12.99, so I was relieved at that price. You may wonder how that squares with starting her challenge - these were a prior intended purchase and necessary, so allowed.  There will be no further book, DVD, shoe, clothing, trinket, gift, etc purchased, though - it will be making do until the 40 days are up.  I am looking forward to it."},
{"title": "Midsummer approaches", "date": "Saturday 19 June 2010", "text": "It may soon be the longest day but the weather is far from summery.  The FH even contemplated lighting the fire this evening, but has settled instead for a thick jumper and a hot cup of tea.  Sure enough, I have just been out to shut up the hens and it is quite light enough to see without a torch, and we have a couple more days before the light starts to fade again.  It feels like those glorious days we had in April and May must have been the summer, and this today feels more autumnal with grey clouds scudding across the sky in the wind, and the sun hidden behind them.  I am hoping that there may be a few more sunny days - but I fear we may have to wait until September for them!!It is too cold to put the chicks out under the verandah at the moment, although I had wanted to do so today.  Fingers crossed for later in the week.Tomorrow sees the start of the 40 day/£100 challenge initiated by the YFG this time, so I will be going through the freezers to plan the meals as far ahead as I can.  I am going to make a point of making more vegetarian meals this time!  Watch this space..."},
{"title": "Day out at the show", "date": "Friday 18 June 2010", "text": "The EFG wasn't too well last night, so she couldn't go to school today (they have rules about this sort of thing!) but she was actually fine this morning, so I took her to the East of England Show today.  Today is cheap day - £6 for adults and kids go free.  At the weekend, a family ticket would be £28, so I deliberately chose today.  The Fh wouldn't have managed to walk around as he has sore ankles and feet, and the YFG was at school, practising for her play.We had a good mooch around - we got there at about 10.45am, and we stayed until approx 1.45pm so we weren't there that long, but that was the time I had available, so we made the most of it.The EFG took some lovely photos which I will have to wait for her to download and send to me, but I can tell you about some of it....it wasn't as good as some years, as there seemed to be a lot of green grass on show where in years gone by, there would have been stalls.  There were a lot of animals - which was good, and very interesting.  We looked around and looked some more - we did make some small purchases, though.  There is a company called Elegance Skincare, and they make a gorgeous Gardener's Honey Handcream, which does wonders for the YFG's eczema, so I bought two little tubs of that, as it is cheaper at shows than through mailorder.  I bought the YFG a necklace, as a sort of consolation because she didn't get to come, and then I got a walnut cake, which is her favourite - but although she said it was good, she said it wasn't as good as mine - she knows how to butter me up!!Possibly the best bit was meeting up, quite accidentally, with some old friends who had moved away from our area to live in Peterborough and we had lost touch with them.  Their eldest son was in the EFG's class at school, but now he is so tall, I couldn't believe it!  He is a lovely young man, and their daughter has grown up from the five or six year old I remember, into an almost-teenager!  Their younger boy is about 7 or 8 now, and a really cheeky little chap.  They were all playing in one of the orchestras which were taking it in turns to play to the people relaxing in deckchairs.  Mum was on the trumpet, elder boy on the tuba, younger boy on the trombone, and doing really well, and dad was on the French horn.  We couldn't see the daughter, but she was playing too.  It was amazing to see them and catch up on their news.Tonight we have been to gymnastics, and are quite tired after our day.  I have been so impressed to see the YFG do a Hecht into a dive roll - she soared through the air and even the HC said he had never seen her do it as well as that before; I didn't know she had done it before!  The EFG is beginning to come with us to learn how to do some coaching.  I think she enjoyed it tonight as she was asking plenty of questions!"},
{"title": "Out of the mouth of babes.......", "date": "Thursday 17 June 2010", "text": "comes such wisdom at times that it floors me.I had taken a neighbour shopping this morning, and thought that I would get my own shopping done as well so that I didn't have to trudge around the supermarket on Saturday afternoon, which is when I went last week.  Last week, I was doing some restocking from the special offers, and I spent just over £100.  Today I went with a list, and only deviated from it slightly, and the bill still came to nearly £75!!When we were eating supper tonight, I jokingly said that we would have to stop eating as it was getting so expensive, so the YFG simply suggested that we do another £100 challenge - and the FH and EFG agreed!  She said that we should do it for 40 days this time, drew up a contract with each of them declaring that they would not ask for things nor encourage me to spend money, and made us all sign it!  Who could possibly ask for more support than that?!?  We begin on Sunday.On the other side of the coin, I have noticed, as have many people on the MSE forums, that the shops are putting the prices up quite dramatically!  Prices are not rising by a penny here and there, but by 20p in places, and even more.  It could be quite frightening - it has made me stop and think a while, certainly.  I am keen to hear the new Budget on 22 June and find out what \"lifestyle changes\" this new Government has in store for us.One piece of good news, anyway: we have a motorhome which we bought in 2003 and have had some great little holidays with it.  It has been to Scotland, Norfolk and Suffolk, Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire that I can remember.  It was cosy when the children were small, and it has become more cramped as they have grown!!  Unfortunately there was some hidden damp when we bought it, and it has got worse.  The FH effected some repairs which were ample to allow us to continue to use it, and he and the girls had a few days in it at Norwich last summer when the EFG attended a summer school at the UEA, but we haven't been too far in it lately!  Developments today - a man knocked at the door and asked if it was for sale - and we agreed to sell it to him.  He seems to know how to repair it himself, and it is frankly a weight off our minds to know that it is going.  He left a deposit today and is coming back for it tomorrow when he will pay the balance.  We have got back much less than we paid, but we are satisfied with the happy memories and the good use we have made of it over the years."},
{"title": "Receiving things gracefully", "date": "Wednesday 16 June 2010", "text": "People who know us personally will appreciate that I never refuse anything I am offered!  My thinking behind this is that if I say, \"No, thanks!\" to someone too many times, they stop offering and find someone else to give their surplus to.  I may not need or like what is on offer, but I always accept as I know that I can find someone else who needs or wants what is on offer, and as long as someone benefits in the long run, surely that is a good thing.UJ frequently brings us asparagus when it is in season, and I hate the stuff!  However, I know that the FH loves it, so I accept and just cook enough for him at the mealtime.  I also have two neighbours who also love it, and think of it as a delicacy, so I am happy to pass a little of it on to their families.  A offers me potatoes on a regular basis, and they are great potatoes, so I am pleased to accept them every time!  He gave me some sprouting broccoli last week which he had let go to seed a little, and it was too strong to eat, so the chickens enjoyed it!!Part of the cycle here is the giving - and making the person who is doing the giving feel appreciated!  There is a lovely man at band practice who will often give me a little parcel of cooking apples, or a couple of tomato plants, or perhaps some lettuces in season.  I accept and then the next week, I may take him some eggs or a jar of jam, which he always thanks me for.If you offer someone something of which you have a surplus, and they consistently refuse, I think that it becomes harder to continue to offer them things, as you begin to wonder why they are refusing everything.  Sometimes you have to realise that they are not interested in the same things that you are, and so they have no need of some of the things; in that case, find a more appropriate recipient.  I have a friend who sometimes refuses spare plants for the vegetable garden, and I have realised that hers is a small plot and she is less ambitious with her planting than I am.  However, if I offer outgrown clothes for her children, they are accepted!There is, of course, a lot of truth in the saying that \"what goes around comes around\" and I believe that the more I give, the better I feel, and that when I am in need, people will offer the things of which I have need.  Giving makes even the poorest person feel better because it helps us to realise that we should be grateful for our many blessings, and that we are well off in comparison with so many people in the world.  \"Pass it on\" as much as you can, and the blessings will come back your way, eventually!"},
{"title": "Baking Day", "date": "Tuesday 15 June 2010", "text": "This morning, I did some baking - Harry Eastwood's All American Vanilla Cupcakes, and the carrot cake I gave the recipe for a day or three ago! I hadn't planned to make that, but the carrots I bought on Saturday had gone soft and horrible, so I washed them, peeled and grated them up and there was exactly enough for two carrot cakes. Unfortunately, I've no cream cheese in, so they will be getting the sprinkle of icing sugar over the top.Other news - the FH and the EFG cleaned the slabs under the verandah this afternoon; they look sparkling clean now, and he and I ate out there tonight when I got home from gym. It is lovely out there at that time in the evening - so peaceful.The weather is set fair for the week ahead, so I am looking forward to some more gardening time this week - lawns to be cut, still haven't sown more lettuce seeds, weeding to do, etc. The wonderful soil we bought in and have spread liberally around the garden has brought it's own plague of weeds along for the ride - haven't identified them yet, but I keep hoeing them when I have a chance.I ordered some Davina fitness DVDs yesterday - we are feeling the need to drop some pounds and get a bit fitter!  I need to lose a couple of stone if I am honest, and it would make my life easier, but my dietary restrictions make it difficult.  Excuses!  I am hoping that if I up the exercise, I may get away with eating the usual stuff that I am used to...The FH needs to lose considerably more - probably about 5 stone (aaargh!!!) but I don't see it happening - his bad ankles and feet put exercise beyond his reach, apparently, and he loves cheese too much!!  I may go back to Slimming World in the long run but we'll see how the exercise goes for now - I need more energy!"},

I am hoping that they both pass!  The YFG and her friend P are going to be two of the four gymnasts which the volunteers will use to demonstrate their coaching abilities.  I'm planning to watch from the gallery - I'll be on tenterhooks up there!!More lolly sticks came in the post today - 500 of them.  I was hugely impressed with the service from a cookshop in Monmouthshire - I ordered them yesterday and they arrived this morning.  Do have a look around their website if you love to cook!!"},

This morning, she has moved the nest around from where I put the eggs in the house, but she is sitting on them, so fingers crossed for a successful hatch on or around the 1st July. I also set another batch of eggs in the incubator that had failed to hatch the last set of eggs it had had in it.  I checked the temperature, and hopefully this lot will have a more positive outcome.  I included some GPO eggs, some Sebrights and a couple of the Silver Laced Wyandottes too, so it is a real mixed bunch this time.They will also hatch around the 1st July, so we may be able to try to foster some of the incubated eggs to the broody if she doesn't have a good hatch herself.  I've never tried that before, but there is a first time for everything!"},
{"title": "Our new favourite carrot cake recipe", "date": "Thursday 10 June 2010", "text": "I made this a couple of weeks ago and it was demolished within a few days - everyone loved it!  The recipe came from a relatively new magazine called \"Good to know recipes\" which is a monthly recipe magazine - from the publishers of the IPC magazine family.  I like it because the editors seem to be on a mission to provide down to earth value for money food! They have a website here.So, the recipe.It needs a 2lb loaf tin, lined (I use a liner from Lakeland in my loaf tins).  The oven temperature is 180C or GM4.It's very simple - put 175g SR wholemeal flour, 1tsp baking powder, 1tsp ground mixed spice, and a pinch of salt into a big bowl.  Add in 100g raisins and 175g soft light brown sugar; mix all those around in the bowl.Separately, mix together 150ml sunflower oil with 3 eggs.  Grate and peel some carrots so that you have 250g to add to the cake.  Then put the carrot in with the dry ingredients and give it a quick mix through.  I then added the eggs and oil and gave it a thorough mix until everything was well mixed and there was no flour lurking anywhere!This whole lot was then put into the cake tin and baked for about an hour.  It smells gorgeous!  The recipe recommends making a topping from 200g cream cheese beaten with 4 tbsp icing sugar and a couple of drops of vanilla essence.  We spread that over the cake when it was cool and then kept the cake in the fridge. On the second occasion, I didn't bother with the topping and just sieved a tiny bit of icing sugar over the top and then was able to keep it in the cupboard in a cake tin.  It was still a hit!  The first time I made it, I didn't have any wholemeal flour in the house, so it was just normal white SR flour, and it was fine.  I did lash out and spend over £1.30 on some Allinson's wholemeal flour for the second version, which did seem to make it a little more filling."},
{"title": "Chicks growing up", "date": "Wednesday 9 June 2010", "text": "These above here are the Brown Sussex chicks - there are six of them in the main brooder box and the one with the bad foot is in a separate box.  I am relieved to be able to say that its foot is now flat, with the toes spread out properly.  It does tend to stand on the other leg occasionally, as if to take the weight off the weaker foot, but it is much improved.  We plan to integrate it with the main group soon.This is the same group - I thought this one was looking at me quite cheekily and so I couldn't resist taking this shot.  They are now bedded down on shavings, having made the transition from anti-slip mats.  They also have deeper water troughs now - no marbles either.  Their new water pots are old tuna cans!These gorgeous little guys (and gals, I hope) are the GPOs.  Their partridge feathering is coming through already!  No horrible red glow on this photo as the lamps are now turned off during the daytime.Heads down and bottoms in the air as they tuck in to their tea time ration of chick crumbs.This photo shows their wing feathers coming through well.  There are also six GPOs in this box, so we have the baker's dozen at the moment.  You've probably noticed that there isn't much difference in the plumage of the two groups at this stage - we've put rings on the GPOs today so that we know for sure which is which, in case they get mixed up at any time - and it is possible that when they go outside, they may all go in together, which will ease the transition of the solitary bird into the flock, as each group will think that he came along with the other group, I hope!There was a GPO hatch due today - not a single egg is showing any sign of hatching.  I will leave them until Friday and then we'll have to look at them.I'm not sure what to do about candling eggs - I bought a proper candler but most of the eggs we have incubated seem to have thick shells which the light does not penetrate; the only eggs I have successfully candled have been the Sebright bantam ones which are very thin. It's still raining - enough said about that."},

The water butts are overflowing, the ground is sodden, and I need to get out there and do some more gardening...Yesterday was a kitchen day - I cleaned out several cupboards and they now look fresh and sparkling.  A lot of things I don't use very often have been stored in the garage, so there is a little more wiggle room in the cupboards - and I have found something I really, really want!!  A nifty carousel to go in one of my awkward cupboards - there's a picture here and it would be so handy.  I'll put it on the wish-list for later when I have some spare money (ha! when is money ever spare? but you know what I mean!).Today I wasted most of the morning as I just didn't feel that well so I sat around in my pjs until lunchtime, watching daytime TV - if you have a ukelele in the loft, it just might fetch £400 at auction!  Sad.  I perked up a little after lunch, and then had to go to a meeting at school at 3pm, post some eggs off to GTM with a little prayer that they get there safely, and then head off to gym.  I could have had more enthusiasm tonight, but I managed.  I hope I feel better tomorrow.The EFG has had some good results in her exams, and now that the results are filtering through, it really is a delight to see how hard she has worked.  The YFG did her SATS but I have no idea how well she has done.  She is off to a day at the secondary school next week, so she will get an idea of what life might be like there."},

We just got finished in the garden late this afternoon before the first spots fell.  There has been a steady rain ever since, and the garden is smelling fresh and looking very green. We planted 48 tomato plants in various planters around the garden, moved lots more soil and raked it into the garden beds and weeded the other garden bed which also received the soil and compost as a top dressing so that the bed will be ready to receive some plants sometime soon.The cooler weather meant that working in the garden was a much more pleasant experience for us all this afternoon.This morning saw a triple baptism at church - a set of non-identical triplets who are about 8, I think.  They wore beautiful cream dresses, gold sandals and lovely necklaces.  Afterwards there was a larger than usual buffet and christening cake.  We stayed much later than usual at church, and really enjoyed the celebrations. I think that one of the Light Sussex hens has gone broody, so I'll watch her for a couple of days and then, if she seems tight, I am going to give her some eggs to sit on.  Last night was reloading day for the incubators - the older ones are now holding Brown Sussex (13) and a mixture of Sebright/Silver Laced Wyandotte/GPO eggs (15) and the new automatic one has got the 11 Barred Plymouth Rock and the 6 bought-in Brown Sussex.  Fingers crossed for a successful time.There is a hatch due on Wednesday, though given recent experiences, they could start to hatch Tuesday - that should be a mixture of the Silver Laced Wyandotte and the GPO eggs.

Hopefully they will crop well anyway. I also got the climbing French beans, the heritage Cherokee Trail of Tears, planted in a trough so that they can go up the trellis too.  The courgettes have been put in as well, and interplanted with lettuce, which will be ready before the courgettes spread out too far.  And then I sowed some seeds straight into the ground - French flat-leaved parsley, spring onions, beetroot and radish.After all that, it was late lunchtime, and shower time!  I sat down for a while to cool off, and then headed off to the County gym meeting at Huntingdon.  That was an eye-opener!  I went with another coach from our club, and we met coaches from several other gyms in the county which was good, and it is brilliant to get to know other coaches for the future as we may be looking for help and advice in the years to come so they will be the people we are turning to!Tonight, I came home and cooked a very simple supper - salmon, new potatoes and broccoli/peas - and sat down to watch the Final of Britain's Got Talent.  The right people, Spelbound, won - yay!  I will be looking out for Christopher Stone in the future, though, as he has got a great voice and really came out of himself in the last two shows. The evening ritual of shutting up the henhouses has been expanded now to include watering the beds and the greenhouse, but rain is forecast tomorrow so I may get a night off soon.

{"title": "Eggs and eBay", "date": "Friday 4 June 2010", "text": "The Barred Plymouth Rock eggs turned up today.  Although the seller marked them as \"dispatched\" on Wednesday, they weren't actually posted until yesterday - hence their arrival this lunchtime.  On arrival, I was disappointed to find one broken.  All of the eggs are dated with the date they were laid - I was not happy at all to find that two of them were dated 21/5 - two weeks ago!! Rather than leave negative feedback for the seller straight away, I emailed to express my disappointment and dismay.  He replied and said that he was advertising them for a friend who had only got two birds laying an egg each per day and lately several had been cracked which was what had delayed sending the eggs out to me.  I don't buy that as most of the eggs pre-date the day I bought them so they already had these there - only four of them come from later days. He has promised that he will replace them if they are not fertile, so I am going to let them rest and settle overnight and then put them in the incubator tomorrow.  I will candle them in a week's time and then let him know. I won't be using this seller again as I was not happy with the packaging either.  Ebay is a very hit and miss affair!!On our own chick development front - the last Brown Sussex to hatch has got out of the shell - but the FH helped it this morning, and it has a bad foot in that the foot has not spread out properly and is a little twisted.  We haven't put it in with the others for fear of bullying, but it is under the lamp in the incubator with the lid off.  It is eating and drinking so we will assess its chances in a day or two, if it manages to survive.  I won't kill it unless it looks like it is in pain.All the others are fine and doing well - eating, drinking and pooing, so they will have to be cleaned out in the morning.We have been out in the garden all day today - and I took some photos to celebrate what we have achieved!  Above - six \"Burpless\" ridge cucumbers planted in pots near the new trellis so that they can climb and enjoy sunshine nearly all day.One of the two new water butts to collect rainwater that we can use to water the plants - note the watering can handily stored at the side.More cucumbers and lettuce planted in the greenhouse - three of these are the \"Burpless\" variety and the other three are \"Telegraph\".These are some of the runner beans, planted this afternoon.  The FH made these troughs quite wide so I thought I would make use of the extra space and put a few lettuce plants in there as well.  The troughs are filled with a mixture of the topsoil we had delivered and some \"soil enhancer\" the girls and the FH fetched this afternoon from the household recycling centre - it's free so they brought a trailer load home.  Some of it is in the troughs and some is going on the veg beds.More runner beans - the other side of the trellis and slightly narrower troughs so just beans here.I let the four Brown Sussex out of their little run this afternoon so that I could take more photos of them - they soon took advantage of the opportunity to have a good scratch around.Here is Lancelot - he's a fine figure of a cockerel but I am beginning to wonder if he is all mouth and no trousers, if you get my drift, as none of us has caught him in action yet, and we have spent time watching them!The hens look quite drab from a distance but up close there are some beautiful marks on their feathers and we think they are gorgeous!They really enjoyed getting under the bushes and having a good scratch around!"},
{"title": "Chick tally and chick flick", "date": "Thursday 3 June 2010", "text": "The real thing first - there are now six GPO chicks in the brooder box, the latest just put in there tonight as it had been in the incubator all day.  There are also six Brown Sussex in the second brooder box - the last one is still waving a leg around in the incubator and attempting to get out of the egg.  Given that I want to breed strong and healthy birds, it is not getting any help.  I hope it makes it.The chick flick was \"Hotel for Dogs\" which I watched with the EFG as our after-lunch treat today.  The FH and the YFG had gone out to Wicksteed Park in Kettering, and we had done plenty of chores around the place - washing and weeding mostly - so we sat and flopped out in front of the tv during the hottest part of the day.After that, we had to go to town for several bits and bobs - an application for a Railcard for a journey later in the year, corn for a neighbour's chooks, to pick up the certified dead laptop, and to get some fruit and veggies. The FH and YFG got home at about 7pm after a very hot and exciting day, by all accounts.  The YFG took her friend T along for the day, and the FH took one of his older gentlemen along for the ride - the men sat and slept and then watched the world go by, I think, whilst the girls went on every ride in sight and had a wonderful time!!  The YFG had applied plenty of sunscreen so she isn't burned but she does have some strap marks on her shoulders, so more is needed next time!  She's completely flat out in bed now and I think she will sleep very well tonight.The Brown Sussex eggs I ordered from eBay have arrived, but the Barred Plymouth Rock ones didn't turn up this morning, so I am hoping they come tomorrow and then I can get all of them into the incubator tomorrow at the same time.  The next lot of GPO are due on Wednesday so we are still turning those eggs at the moment.Totally surprised this morning to come down and find another GPO chick in the incubator.  The last one had hatched Tuesday and we had decided to turn that incubator off last night, then thought we would give the remaining eggs just one more day - so pleased that we did!!There are two of the Brown Sussex chicks in their incubator, completely out of the shells, and two more in the process - legs waving from the shells.  More later..."},

No one seems to have been safe. Our prayers tonight are for the families and friends of those who have died, and those who are critically and seriously ill.  We are praying that those injured will survive and that those bereaved will find comfort in the arms of their loved ones tonight.Three Brown Sussex chicks have got as far as the brooder box, there is another one out in the incubator, drying out, and two more in there with parts of their anatomy showing, mostly legs!  A further one has made a hole in the egg.  In the morning, I am hoping to have four more to move over to the brooder."},

I ordered it from here and it arrived yesterday or today - I found it today in the hidey hole that the postman and I have agreed as a safe drop if I am not here!  It is very sturdy and seems well worth the outlay.  It is all her fault, as the lollies she suggests and makes look fabulous!!The blocks stand in the stainless holder very well, and you fill them up with mixture and then pop a lolly stick through the hole and freeze - very simple!I followed the recipe Sue uses in the post here for chocolate lollies and they should be ready for the heatwave tomorrow!!Here they are, ready to go in the freezer.  Must get more lolly sticks, though, as the 16 provided won't last long here!The Brown Sussex chicks have started to emerge - there are three out, two in the process and another egg looking positive, so all fingers crossed for about 6 or 7 chicks from this hatch.  They are still in the incubator so it is hard to tell exactly what is going on in there, as we mustn't open it too often (shouldn't open it at all really!) but we'll take some photos tonight when we move the older ones to the brooder box under the light.  These unfortunately look similar to the GPO chicks at this stage so they will have to be kept separate!!"},

Another one had come out of the shell overnight - but today is their due date so I am not giving up on the other eggs just yet.There is a batch of Brown Sussex eggs on eBay - I am bidding on them as they very rarely come up for sale and as I have said before, I need another strain of Brown Sussex for my Brussbar plans, so I am hoping that I will win the auction and have a good result!

I hope that more will hatch overnight and we'll have a count up in the morning; there were 12 eggs in that incubator, so we may have up to 9 more.  The other incubator is warming the Brown Sussex eggs - and they are due tomorrow, but one has started to pip at the shell tonight, so again, there may be news to report there in the morning too!  Excitement all round here at the prospect of hatching the Brown Sussex as they are SO rare....Yes - I felt like putting the flags up yesterday to celebrate - I have one whole veg bed full of dwarf beans.  They are a variety called Tendercrop, so I hope that they grow well and taste good when they are grown.  The weather yesterday was damp when we got up, but it dried off and the sun came out, but there was a gusty west wind most of the day.  I still have the Ferrari dwarf beans to plant out, but there are slightly less of those, and I still have to weed and prepare a bed for those.  Today's plan is to do that and prep a bed to put courgettes and lettuce for the summer.  Yesterday also saw 6 cucumber plants being put into the soil in the greenhouse - I have 18 plants, of two varieties, so I planted 3 of each - Burpless and Telegraph.  The other 12, well - I'm looking for homes for those!  Around those plants, I put some lettuces so that they will come on slightly earlier than the ones I plan to put outside.  Some of the tomato plants were brought out of the greenhouse and up under the verandah so that they can get used to cooler temperatures before actually going outside.Today has dawned bright and clear again, but the wind is from the north east, so it is a little chillier, so I'll just have to wrap up warmer!  There are more jobs to do outside as well as the gardening - the FH is making the troughs for the trellis, and I painted three for him yesterday.  There are two more in the making today, and they will need to be done as well, although the YFG is after some pocket money for a day out on Thursday so she may ask for the job!  Now that the FH has his driving license back, he is taking the YFG and her friend to Wicksteed Park in Kettering on Thursday - the EFG doesn't want to go so she and I will be having a day at home."},
{"title": "Spring rain", "date": "Saturday 29 May 2010", "text": "It has been raining on and off nearly all day today - and the garden really needs it, so I can't complain.  The beans didn't get planted yesterday because I had to take the FH out on an errand which apparently couldn't wait, but I have potted most of the tomatoes up this afternoon - rain doesn't matter when I am in the greenhouse!  There are lots of varieties and I am looking forward to seeing which are the best this year.  The chickens aren't too happy with the showers after all the sunny days we have had but they will have to get used to it as I think that there is more rain forecast over the next few days.Gym this morning, and we had a busy day with lots to do.  We decided on the date for the holiday club week, and it is booked at the sports centre, so I can now plan our summer a little more, knowing when we are committed to being where! When the YFG and I got home from gym this afternoon, the FH was holding a VERY important piece of paper - the letter from the DVLA saying he can DRIVE again!!!!!!!! Whoopee!  You can't imagine how happy I am to have that letter at long last!  And what a relief it is that he is mobile under his own steam again - thank you, DVLA!"},
{"title": "Gosh - it's Thursday!!", "date": "Thursday 27 May 2010", "text": "Can't believe that I have been absent for nearly three days - time flies!  What have we been up to?Tuesday went by in a flash and all I really remember was that it was gymnastics in the late afternoon and evening.  In the morning, though, the FH and I went to the timber yard and fetched the trellis and fence posts - that was a laugh, trying to get everything home on the roof of the Astra estate car - we managed it!  We made some holes and got the Metposts lined up but not actually in the ground.Wednesday was a busy one - the FH and UJ took 12 hens and 3 rabbits to the auction at Mildenhall; I needed to move some of the crossbreed hens on to new homes so that I can concentrate on the breeding groups. I did keep Goldenburg back as she has a special place here and we love her.  We also loved Bubblegum the rabbit, but it made sense to find her a new home.  Apparently, although we got less than £1 a rabbit, they all went for pets rather than to butchers, thank goodness.  They were all pure Dutch rabbits, and are all very sociable, so some people got bargains!  Whilst the FH was out, I went to town to meet two of the helpers to finalise their logbooks for their coaching exams.  We spent nearly two hours drinking tea in Tesco's cafe but we just about got them done.  I came home in time to pick up the YFG from school, then I needed a rest before trundling off to see my sister in the other town - she's had a operation on her foot - and pick up the EFG from Rounders club.  Then (there's more!!) we had a lovely meal together with UJ before the YFG and I had to go to a meeting about the Gala in the summer when all the year 6 girls get to be the Gala Princesses.  Cue painting and decorating a float in July....It came as no surprise to find that I was exhausted today - so I went back to bed and slept most of the morning away once the girls were off to school.  I made up for it once I rose again, though, as we have got the trellis up and finished, looking good!  I have also been weeding the veg beds this evening in an attempt to get one or two ready for planting - the dwarf beans ARE going in tomorrow.  I also need to finish another bed off for the lettuces, and then there are the tomatoes to pot up, and the FH had almost made troughs to go under the trellis to plant the runner beans in so that they grow up the trellis.  Knowing that runners like deep soil, he has made the troughs extra deep.I must put up the new-to-us recipes we have found lately - there's the rhubarb crunch cake with variations, the excellent carrot cake and the fudgey-wudgey chocolate cookies."},
{"title": "Heatwave indeed", "date": "Monday 24 May 2010", "text": "The heat has been unseasonable this weekend and we are expecting a return to more normal temperatures for the time of year this week.  The mercury in the greenhouse hit the top of the thermometer, and the tomatoes wilted a little.  They are OK now, but a couple of the pepper seedlings didn't make it.Sunday was a good day - the YFG and I went to church and then came home to the cool!  The FH took the girls to a neighbour's BBQ at lunchtime, and I had a sleep in the reclining chair until the EFG came home, and went out again.  The FH returned at about 3.30pm and had a snooze on the sofa but the YFG stayed, playing with her friends, until 6.30pm.  My dad came over in the evening and we trawled the internet for a suitable holiday for him and MB to take, now that the insurance is going to be more tricky to access after the January event in Antigua!  We found a P&O cruise around the UK, and a couple of specialist insurance companies for him to contact today, so fingers crossed that they are able to help him.I have been spending again - there was the incubator, new glass for the verandah windows, a wireless strimmer for the grass around the garden beds (it drives me crazy!) and today some Metposts and water butts for the garden.  We are going to put some trellis up, so the Metposts are to hold the fence posts for the trellis.  The trellis will be purchased tomorrow, with the fence posts, from our friends, Roger and Kevan, who have a local cut-price timber yard.  I have been thinking about buying the Wii fit system to add to the Wii games that we already have, but I think I will consider it a bit longer!  I have found a good deal at Amazon, which is cheaper than Tesco, but perhaps there are still better deals out there..."},
{"title": "Doings in the Fens", "date": "Saturday 22 May 2010", "text": "Much has been going on!  The verandah has been reclaimed from the ravages of the chickens over the winter months, and we now have a nice dining area again out there.  It has taken a lot of hard work with mop and bucket, broom, shovel and cobweb brush - but it was far too hot today to do it during the day, so we started at about 7pm and finished at 10.10pm, tired and rather dusty - showers are in order before bed tonight.The new incubator arrived yesterday and has been put to work tonight with 20 eggs.  It turns them automatically, so that is one less job for me.  On the egg front, I am disappointed to report that I caught one of the Brown Sussex hens eating an egg this morning.  Apart from the fact that the eggs are wanted for the breeding programme, it is really bad to let them get away with eating the eggs, so I must try blowing one out and filling it with a mustard mixture to put her off. The YFG didn't come to gym last night as she came out of school hot, bothered, crotchety and with a headache, so she stayed at home.  I told her to rest and drink plenty, and stay in the lounge where it is refreshingly cool.  What did she do?  Went into the kitchen, where it is south facing and hot already, put the oven on and made some Fudgeywudgey chocolate cookies.  They are enormous but seem to be very popular with the family and her friends, so no doubt that recipe will have to be added to our collection - it makes a very chewy cookie."},
{"title": "Goldfinches in the garden", "date": "Thursday 20 May 2010", "text": "The FH and I had a beautiful surprise this afternoon when we sat in the garden - two dainty little goldfinches came fluttering down and pecked at something in the grass for a few minutes, letting us have a good look at them, before flying away again.  When we moved in here, six years ago, there was hardly any vegetation as it was a bare new plot, and most of the neighbours were the same, but now we are getting more established and the wildlife is moving in - there has been a hedgehog family here for a couple of years, and we are now getting more interesting bird species beyond the sparrow and the starling. The FH's sister and her husband arrived at 10.30 this morning and stayed for a couple of hours.  There was much reminiscing, in which I couldn't really take part, as they all grew up together in Northamptonshire and a generation or two ahead of me, so I knew little of which they were speaking.  I made the coffee and listened.  They kindly brought us three bottles of wine from their travels in France, and the FH enjoyed their company.  No doubt he will see them again in December.This afternoon, after I had picked the YFG up from school, we made a trip to town, as there were a couple of things I needed to do: I fetched some glass for the verandah windows from the glazier, some breeder's pellets for the chickens from the feedstore and I also put a couple of cheques in the bank.  My mobile phone was in dire need of a top up, financially speaking, so I dealt with that as well.I didn't out the next batch of eggs in the incubator the other evening as it wasn't hot enough, but it has reached a satisfactory temperature tonight, so it has been loaded up with 10 Gold Partridge Orpington eggs and 2 Silver laced Wyandotte eggs.  I ordered a new Corti 25 automatic incubator on Tuesday, so I hope that it will come soon as I have quite a few Brown Sussex eggs ready to give it a go."},

Only a few to get started, but I am very pleased with myself as I do need a nudge to propel me into action sometimes.  There is even a \"shopfront\" for the books, so I am thrilled!!Today has been another day at home - I've made the rhubarb crunch cake from the recipe at the wonderful site in the sidebar called Mennonite Girls Can Cook.  Can they ever!?!  This cake has gone down a storm here and with some of the neighbours - I have got a lot of rhubarb and so I doubled the recipe and made two cakes, each in a 9 x 13 Swiss roll tin.  There isn't a lot left.  Have a look at the original recipe here although I didn't do it exactly like that.  I didn't have any strawberry jello/jelly crystals, so I tossed the rhubarb in vanilla sugar as I had a sachet from Lidl's and wasn't sure what to do with it!  The gang here would recommend you all to have a go at it.I've also been busy in the garden, weeding the strawberry patch, but there is still more to do there.  I've cut the back lawn, and given the cuttings to the chooks to have a good scratch around with, and I had to have a shower afterwards as I was covered in bits of grass and my feet were filthy.Tomorrow the FH's sister and her husband are coming for a visit, so it is a good job that the carrot cake hasn't been touched yet.  They live out in Norfolk about an hour away near Thetford, so we don't see them that often at all, probably twice a year.  It will be good to catch up on all the family news from them."},
{"title": "Calm again", "date": "Tuesday 18 May 2010", "text": "I got rather stressed last week with the pressures of life and driving everyone everywhere.  Sunday morning I got up and told the family that everything was cancelled until Friday - no church, no band, no gym, no rounders, no art club - we are all effectively grounded until Friday!  The relief is wonderful - the time to stay at home and just do stuff here is great. Yesterday I ironed, spring cleaned, tidied, threw things out, put things away, etc.  Today, I have done more of the same, with a bit of internet research thrown in and a friend round for a cuppa later on this afternoon.  It was nice to take the time to reconnect with her and just relax.Tonight, the YFG and I have baked; she has made some coffee flavoured cupcakes all on her own, right through to the icing.  I have been chief washer-up and also made a carrot cake to a recipe I hadn't tried before.  I made an online Asda order and that got delivered tonight so I have some sour cream to make a rhubarb crumble cake with tomorrow, and the Philadelphia cheese with which to frost the carrot cake.  That's tomorrow's work.Talking of work, we seem to have decided by mutual consent that our time as book delivery people is probably over.  This has come at the right time, as there is so much to do at home that I don't really feel we have the time to continue anyway.  Finding a way to replace the small amount of regular income it brought will be another matter, though.  I do have about a tonne of books still in the garage from my time with Usborne, so I have made a business account on eBay and plan to sell them there.  I took some to the post office this afternoon (when I picked the YFG up from school) to get them weighed for postage charges, and plan to list them tomorrow to see if this will work.  I know I won't make the RRP but I am thinking that whatever I make is a bonus and better to have the money in the bank rather than sitting on the shelf.The Brown Sussex chickens are still laying but they seem to have had a couple of off days and I have only 10 eggs to go into the incubator tonight, instead of the dozen or 14 I had been hoping to have acquired by now.  I'm going to go ahead with that, but it is a little disappointing.  The Gold Partridge Orps are still laying 3 a day (there are 4 of them) nearly every day, but I don't have any more incubator space.....you can see where this is going, I'm sure.  I'm now considering buying a \"proper\" automatic incubator!  This would save me the hassle of hand-turning the eggs, but it would also reduce the variables in the whole process and may make the hatch rate better. The breeder pellets I am going to pick up from the feed store on Saturday should also increase fertility a little, so I hope that they like the pellets!The French beans have had two days outside in the sunshine and look very healthy.  I am returning them to the greenhouse each night, as it is rather chilly to leave them out all night.  The lettuces are looking good, too - and the tomato plants!! I am removing laterals from them already.  The Gold Laced Orp chicks had their first night in the ark last night, and emerged rather timid and shy this morning, but have spent a happy day scratching about and enjoying the extra space which the ark affords them compared to the box they were in.  The single Sebright chick spent the night with them, but when they came out this morning, it unfortunately didn't take them long to realise that he was not one of their number, and he had to be removed as they were starting to attack him.  He is back in his box in the utility room tonight whilst I think of plan B for him."},

Night times find them in the utility room, as bringing them back into the lounge meant that they were getting accustomed to the warmth again and we really need to be hardening them off.  When the weather settles (ha!) into some sort of pattern for warmth, they will be in an ark outside permanently.The YFG has had her SATS this week and survived without a wobble, so I am hoping that the EFG does as well in her exams this week.

Lancelot and his ladies are doing fine, and I am really pleased with the way they are settling in - 3 eggs yesterday and another two today, so the eggs I have from them are going into the incubator tonight.  I put a dozen Gold Partridge Orps in last night, so they will all hatch within a day or so and can brood together.The Gold Laced Orp chicks went outside today for their first time: I just moved their box out onto the freezer under the verandah and they could enjoy what sunshine there was without being too cold.  I brought them back in for the night, though, as it is not warm enough to leave them out.The YFG is doing SATS tests at school this week - tomorrow is the final day for them.  She seems unfazed by the exams themselves and is excited to get to school early each day at 8.15am to have breakfast with her classmates before school starts as a special treat.  I'll be glad when this week is over, though, and we get back to 8.35am starts!  I also had the form through to apply for her bus pass for September when she moves up to secondary school.The EFG had a day at home today, as she had rather a temperature last night as well as a headache and a cold.  She rested most of the day and is feeling better now, so she will be back in the fray tomorrow.UJ was also here today and I made him a cake to take home - he was also supposed to take some ham and bacon which my sister had got from the cash and carry for him, but we forgot between us, so I will have to put them in my freezer for him until we see him again..."},

This is the first step in the Brussbar breeding programme - I now need the Barred Plymouth Rocks, and another strain of Brown Sussex.  The lady also gave us five eggs that the girls have laid recently, so when I have a dozen, they will be going in the incubator.I have 14 Gold partridge Orpington eggs ready to go into the incubator tomorrow if it has hit the right temperature by then.Photos of Lancelot and his ladies to follow tomorrow!

All that sort of thing, and I have had a long conversation with a fellow book delivery person, and it seems that some one has muddled up our territories, and actually, I have very little official territory, and most of my work is in his area, and so not really my work at all.The FH is back to Papworth tomorrow and hasn't thought about packing his bag.Gym again in the morning, and I am soooooooooo tired I can't contemplate what on earth I am going to teach 8 little two and three year olds........But hey!  Tomorrow is another day - I'll hassle the boss over the territory, I'll phone Environmental Health on Monday about the smoke and see if she has any grounds for an official complaint and I'll only worry if she has, and on Saturday night, sans FH, we can have a girly night in with a DVD and some popcorn.

Runner beans were sown in the greenhouse in pots, as were some more heirloom seeds, Cherokee Trail of Tears climbing French beans - I have high hopes for those as I have heard so much about them, all good!  Everything in the greenhouse was very well watered, and then I moved on to the chickens.  Two chicken houses were re-sited on the rough grass at the side of the house, and another was just moved onto some fresh grass.  Several of the chicken houses were cleaned out as well, so now they smell fresh and clean with the scent of the pine from the wood shavings which I have put on their floors.  After all that, I was ready to do some weeding but the trowel broke, so that was that for today.Lots of schools in the local area have received an email from me today with a new poster advertising the gymnastics classes we run.  We have several vacancies in the class structure where classes are not quite full, so we have space for more new kids to join.  I've also been emailing the Wonens' Development coach at Huntingdon for some info about competitions.This evening, I was cooking the supper at the same time as making more lemon curd.  Three double batches of the recipe have produced eight jars, so we have lots to share. The lady who is selling me the Brown Sussex trio has been on the phone and would like the birds collected sooner rather than later, so we are trying to make arrangements to get them on Monday from her in Kent.  Either I will go and get them, or we will ask a neighbour to take the FH and we will pay the petrol.  Whatever happens, I need to sort out a house for them quick smart!  They were hatched last year, and she says that they are quite fertile, so fingers crossed that we can get some chicks out of them this year.The YFG's class is going to London at the very end of term to see the musical, \"Wicked\" which I have just found out is currently starring Lee Mead of Joseph fame - I am so jealous that she gets to go on this trip!!  I paid for it today, so that is £38 out of the budget this week.Must go to do the ironing now - I am not staying up to watch the election results come in as I've done my bit for women's rights by casting a vote so I'll just wait until the morning to see who is in charge now.  I think that the Conservatives are probably going to be the ones this time, but I might be wrong...."},

Those varieties are growing in abundance, and the others are doing fine too.  I just wish I had time to get the veg beds in the garden ready to get the plants out soon, but there are rather too many weeds on them yet, and the heaps of compost from our compost bin which also need to get dug in.  The weather hasn't been kind at all this week and it has been cold and damp, so I haven't ventured into the garden to do any of that.....I must!The FH is presently engaged in building me a new chicken shed - it is quite large.  He has put down the shuttering to make a concrete base and he has someone coming to help him with the concreting on Friday.  He has made the panels for the shed and they are waiting to be put up, and then we just have to sort the roof out.  This is meant to be a proper chicken breeding shed so that the various breeds can be separated properly.  I am really looking forward to its completion sometime soon.The FH has to go back to Papworth on Saturday for an overnight stay, so he wants to get the concreting done before he goes.  My sister is also supposed to be borrowing the concrete mixer at the weekend so he has an added incentive to get it done.  I am hoping for some good weather so that I can get out there and do some gardening too.I have begun today to collect Gold Partridge Orpington eggs so that I can hatch them in the incubator; the girls laid three between them today, so I am hoping that they lay the same number each day for the next three days, and I'll soon get a dozen.  I think a dozen is a good number, and they fit comfortably into the incubators.  In about a month's time, there could be more chicks!!  The Gold Laced Orps which hatched at the end of last month are doing well, and their first real feathers are just coming through - gorgeous.I have realised that I have a difficult couple of months coming up financially - TV license, RAC membership, Volvo car tax - and the bill has just come in for the Volvo's new battery too.  Roll on 2012 when the FH will turn 75 and we'll no longer have to pay for a TV license.  Normally, I would have money in the second bank account put aside for these \"extra\" bills as they are regular and I do anticipate them, but I have challenged myself by putting more into the savings account and so we are going to have to come up with this money from May and June's income.  It is doable, as it just means cutting back a little - and since I finished the Lent challenge, I have splurged a little too - so I have full freezers to work from already!"},

Friday whizzed past in a blur of book deliveries in the morning, a brief rest and then off to gym for the rest of the day.  When we come home from gym on a Friday, it really is a case of tea, bath and bed as we are too tired to do much more.  Occasionally, I will be organised enough to fling a load of washing in the machine, but even that didn't happen this week.Saturday morning, I was up just before dawn, at 4.30am in order to be organised enough to meet up with someone in Huntingdon at 7.30am, nip in to Tesco to get the YFG breakfast doughnuts as the reward for getting up so early, and then head off to gym again for a 9.30am start there.  We are running a class now for Tots who will turn 3 this year - and it is fun!  The Head Coach said he couldn't do it to save his life, but I am enjoying it.  I was telling the kids on Saturday to imagine that a hoop was a big puddle and to imagine themselves jumping into it with both feet and making the biggest splash - and they were up for that.  I haven't got a lot of imagination, but a little goes a long way, sometimes!Today we have been to church, done some work in the greenhouse, some tidying, invited Dad and MB over to tea tomorrow, and the YFG has her friend T here to have a sleepover tonight, so they are watching You've Been Framed videos on the laptop at the moment.  It was lovely at church this morning that we had a visitor - a young lady was staying at the B&B in the village as she is here from the University of East Anglia at Norwich, studying water voles - apparently we have some around here!  She was from an Asian country - not sure which one - but she speaks excellent English and told us that she is a Presbyterian (I've been one of those when we went to the Church of Scotland for a few years) and she joined in well with the service.  It seems to be an on-going project which she is involved with, so perhaps she will visit us again.I have been so sad lately, reading about the very brief life and death of the son, Freddie, of some home-educating people we know who live not too far from us.  Their blog is in my side-bar but I doubt that you will all be able to access it as some of the posts are password protected.  The death of a child is so sad, and heartbreaking for the family - four young girls were eagerly awaiting the arrival of their new baby brother or sister, and although the baby was born, it seems that visiting was restricted because he was so ill, so they may not have been able to see as much of him as they would have liked.  Our hearts go out to the whole family.   I can't imagine the turmoil which they have been through.The EFG has been working on her stories again, and I am really impressed with the amount she has produced, as well as the quality of the work.  She has ideas about the stories and their development so that there is still a lot to come!  I am excited to see how they turn out - she is writing most days, although she seems to be able to flip from one story to the other - I don't think I could cope with two at once but she is doing really well and managing to do some really comprehensive research to ensure she gets the facts straight."},

Gordon Brown caused controversy yesterday by calling a woman \"bigoted\" and then trying to apologise.  The Conservatives have a big supporting base in this area as our last MP was one, and now they are fielding a new candidate, he seems to have just inherited the support regardless.  To be honest, driving along the roads around here, there are no banners out for any other party; the YFG observed the other day that \"everyone round here will be voting for the blue team!\" and I tried to explain that not everyone plastered their political views on the gateposts!  Those that do, though, are blue here.We were doing well in the garden clear up and poultry shed building project today - I got one hen house moved out of the way of progress, cleaned out and re-sited, and now I have my fingers crossed that the chickens will use it tonight...even though it is is another spot.  I pricked out more lettuce plants today, too, when I had to retreat to the greenhouse in an absolute downpour.  The April showers are here at last - in the very last days of the month!!  I am hoping that they don't knock all my beautiful apple blossom off the trees now that it has come out.  The plum blossom is finished, the pear is waning and now we have the apples - lovely white flowers tinged with pink."},

They went out this morning on errands, came home at 11am for a quick coffee before nipping off to the lunch club.  They spent most of the afternoon digesting the lunch, before taking the trailer and going off to buy a tonne of washed ballast (mixed gravel and sand to the rest of us).  Then it was time for tea and now they are out again at a Historical society talk about the floods of 1947.  I expect they will turn up again soon!!I have been doing things around the house and garden, tidying and catching up on a few things.  The chicks have all been cleaned out and given fresh newspaper, for example.  I've also been out in the garden and cut the front lawn as well as potting up some tomato plants - I have at least six kinds, I have realised - Gardener's Delight, Moneymaker, Garden Pearl, Sungold, Sweet Million and a kind I bought from Lidl which have a German name.....not sure, but they are growing!  I was delighted to find that the second set of courgette seeds (Tristan) are through, as are the butternut squash seedlings.  I also managed to fit in a little baking - chocolate buns with choc chips, for teatime.I've managed to track down a 1988 copy of the British Poultry Standards from a secondhand bookshop in Nottinghamshire via www.abebooks.co.uk at just £20 which is a bargain - new editions are going for over £57 on eBay, so I'm avoiding them.The most exciting news of the day is that I have found someone in Kent, near Faversham, who breeds Brown Sussex poultry and she has agreed to sell me a trio for £100.  Now I just have to arrange to go and get them - it's a three hour drive, so I am not sure when I will be able to fit it in, but the sooner the better.  Now I'll have to sort out their accommodation..."},

I now have three secrets to keep - some to do with friends, another to do with an organisation.  I don't know how people who have to keep things confidential all the time manage as I love to discuss things with other people over a cup of tea and get their take on what is going on - but I can't in these cases, and it means that I am going to be glad when the times come for each of them to be secrets no more!!Apart from my agony aunt work these past few days, I have been busy in the wash house - lots and lots of laundry has been out on the line in this wonderful weather we are still enjoying.  We had a little blip in the record on Sunday when there was a little shower or two, but that was perfect for all the people running in the London Marathon as it freshened the air for them and made it more comfortable for running. The veggie seedlings in the greenhouse are doing well - more tomatoes are through as well as the peppers, and there are more courgettes coming through as well.  My free seeds from the BBC's Dig-In campaign arrived this morning - carrot, beans, courgette, basil and salad leaves, so I may plant some of those soon - probably not the courgette though as I am sure that the five plants I have already and the four more coming through are going to be plenty.There was rather an embarassing moment in church on Sunday when my mobile phone went off in the middle of a prayer and I had to scurry off outside to turn it off - when I was turning it off before we went to chapel, I can't have held the \"off\" button down long enough!  I think that next time it will be left in the car so that although we'll have it with us, it won't be in the chapel.  One of my fellow members of the congregation is still taking the mickey out of me every time he sees me!!  However, it would have been useful if the phone had been playing hymn tunes on Sunday morning as we had some challenges with the music for the hymns which the preacher wanted to play - the other worship leader and I have decided that we have to sort the music out once and for all!!  Tis going to take quite some sorting as we have midi discs which are inserted into a keyboard to play the music and they are becoming old-fashioned these days, added to which we don't have a comprehensive index to tell us exactly what we do have and it is a recipe for disaster!I'm off now to read some more of the latest Mma Ramotswe mystery from Botswana - The Double Comfort Safari Club.  I do enjoy these very genteel tales from Alexander McCall Smith.The hatch of the Gold-laced Orpingtons is over - we have four live birds.This is rather disappointing and makes them expensive, but that is the chance you have to take.We started off with 24 eggs, and one exploded last week.  One hatched on Wednesday and the other three made it out of the shells between Thursday and Friday.  Another started to come out of the shell this morning, five days after the first.  That one didn't make it, I'm afraid."},

We are going to have to develop a care plan for this chap soon: we need to decide how to keep him until he might be big enough to put with other birds.  He will certainly need a bigger box this week! One chick is completely out of its shell already!  It was out by 8.45am and is beginning to dry out a little whilst it waits for company.  Hopefully I'll be able to get some photos later.The Gold-laced Orpington eggs have been in the incubator nearly all their allotted time, and now there are noises coming from the incubators - something is beginning to happen!!  It's a really exciting time as we have 24 of these eggs, and really want a successful hatch, so we have everything crossed that at least half the eggs do the business.I've got to go out this morning but I'll be keeping an eye on the incubators to see what is going on when I am home this afternoon - luckily, each incubator does have a viewing window so I am able to watch!"},
{"title": "Glorious sunny days", "date": "Wednesday 21 April 2010", "text": "The plants in the greenhouse are taking the opportunity to grow fantastically well in this lovely weather.  I have now got cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuces, French beans (a LOT of these!), sweet peas, courgettes, and butternut squash in there, with more to come.  There are several kinds of tomatoes, lettuces and courgettes as I wanted to do a little comparison planting to see which had the best yields and resistance to problems.  Unfortunately the grass seeds haven't started to sprout yet, so I think more watering is on the cards.I found a wonderful organisation called The Real Seed Company which sells heirloom/heritage seeds - so I ordered some!  Two kinds of dwarf French beans, a climbing French bean, one kind of tomato and one of kale.  I'm really excited about these and will be sowing them soon!  You can find their website and order through that.  It is a membership club - cost of joining 1p - to get round not being allowed to sell this kind of seed to the \"public\".Yesterday we resumed gymnastics, I had a budgeting meeting at school, and then helped the FH with some things.  I hit the hay at 10.45 and slept!!  Today I have been out with him this morning doing some deliveries, and dropped him off at the lunch club. I'll be going back for him at 1.30pm, then collecting the YFG from school at 3pm, the EFG from her school after 4.30pm when she has finished rounders club and then a Governors meeting tonight from 6.30pm.

Since the FH can't drive at the moment, I have to - to band, to school, to the shops, to work, to the post office, to the doctor's, to the hospital, to the art club, the lunch club, to gym....you get the picture.  No longer can I say, \"Could you just take so and so there?\" or \"Can you pick up the EFG from the after-school club?\" because I know before I ask that he can't.  End of.  It means that I don't get odd half-hours to myself whilst everyone is out, because they can't all go out without me, and whatever needs doing/fetching/taking, it is me who has to do it.I am finding myself getting rather anxious about it all, and wondering what could \"give\" at the moment to give me some space?  Whatever I think, it would all affect somebody, so there isn't a lot I can do about it all at the moment, apart from pray that the 9th May sees the doctor say that the CPAP is working well enough that they can make the recommendation that the FH is fit to drive again.I have made 8 crustless quiches, each with 8 eggs = 64 eggsThey came out of the oven after half an hour and they smelled wonderful!!  They are now all tucked into the freezer, to be pulled out for meals and picnics etc.That's what 84 eggs worth of shell looks like.  I have a plan to dry them out in a low oven and then use them to keep slugs away from the lettuce plants.You might be wondering what I used the other 20 eggs for?  Another dozen went into lemon curd, so I have six more jars of that put up on the pantry shelves, and then I just hard boiled the last 8 and they are in the fridge for breakfasts, quick snacks and lunches.

{"title": "Eco-shopping again", "date": "Sunday 18 April 2010", "text": "Going back to here I am continuing with our take on Lock's Challenges.  We are up to 13 now.Challenge 13: Does recycled toilet roll pass the test?  No, it's not what it sounds like - it is used paper recycled to make toilet roll, OK!?!  I think that Nouvelle is excellent value and soft enough.  The YFG complains about it and asks regularly for softer stuff.  Occasionally I give in.  Not too often!Challenge 14: Can a girl live without clingfilm?Absolutely.  No question.  Hate the stuff!Challenge 15: Staying lovely without chemicals.  Mmm - I still use some Olay products, some Avon soap pumps, bubble bath - all full of chemicals.  Lock \"face-tests\" three products, one of them a recommended Udder cream for cows, but of which she says, \"I did like it, once I'd got my head around the fact that it was designed to be massaged into cows' dangly bits.\" She notes that it was unperfumed and that smell is an important consideration for her.  I don't think I'd go so far as to try that particular cream, but there are others around which do not use parabens, and perhaps I should look for them.  The girls and I have recently switched to roll-on deodorants with no aluminium so that is a start in the right direction.Challenge 16: Can you make your own skincare stuff at home?  Lock investigated this at great length, but I have neither the time nor the inclination to go on emulsifying courses or to grate beeswax.  I'll go back to Challenge 15 and try to find some ready made simple versions.  I don't use a lot of chemicals at all, anyway, so I don't need a lot!Challenge 17: Do natural deodorants really work?  Lock concludes that some of them do, but I am happy with my new roll-on, so I'll use that for now and look into PitRok, which she tried successfully, for next time.Challenge 18: Sunscreens - what's the safety factor?Well, the FH gets Factor 50 Australian stuff  so we all tend to use that.  I thought that was the right thing to do, but apparently there may be dangers in using sunscreens because of the nanoparticles.  Yes, nanoparticles.  No, I hadn't heard of them either.  There is a concern that these tiny particles may be able to penetrate the skin and accumulate in the body in potentially dodgy areas, like the lungs.  Then there's the aluminium question again.  She recommends a couple of parabens-free sunscreens, but in general, she says that her new strategy is: \"I take a short walk without suncream before 11am when the sun's not too high or too hot.  I lurk indoors from midday to 3pm, after which, if I go out, I apply my sunscreen.\"  The walk is to get some sun for the Vitamin D benefits.  I think that I shall adopt a slightly different regime - my usual - wear a light covering of clothes, keep my arms and legs covered as well as the rest of me, wear a hat, and some sunscreen on the bits I can't cover.  I shall look into the sunscreens she recommends, but they don't look mainstream so I am not sure how easy they are to get hold of.Challenge 19: Girl talk - the gory details on sanitary protection.No, I am not brave enough to try the Mooncup, nor the re-usable pads.  At the moment.Challenge 20: Does Fairtrade tea make the best brew?It might, but I buy whatever's on special offer - sometimes Tetley, sometimes PG.Challenge 21: Does ethical coffee hit the spot?Don't need to worry about that one - I don't drink coffee.Challenge 22: Does organic booze beat the hangover?I don't drink to the state at which I would get a hangover, so this one is not a problem for us - we don't drink much at all. Challenge 23: Juicy fruit - juicing your own.We don't have a juicer so we don't do this, and I would worry about the amount of sugar the girls were having if we did.  A friend had one, and I used to watch all the apple pulp having to be removed and marvelling at the waste of all that good fibre.  I'd rather encourage them to drink water and eat the fruit.Challenge 24: Water - what's the best?Here, there is nothing wrong with the tap water and so we drink it by the glassful.  We only buy the odd bottle of water, and we are usually buying it for the bottle, rather than for the water!!Challenge 25: Do real nappies do the business?They did, and I tried, but Oh, the relief at being past all that!!!!!!!!!Challenge 26: Mother's milk or formula?Boob juice all the way!  I fed the EFG for 26 months - yes, she had teeth - and the YFG for 10 months.Challenge 27:  Which toys pass the toddler test?The issues here are of cheap plastic tat, and the carbon footprint raised by importing said tat from China.  The sad demise of the traditional English wooden toy. I think that is enough for tonight.  The EFG is back to school tomorrow so I am up early to get her off at 7.55am.  Good night!Today's offering for using up the glut of eggs is a recipe for baked egg custard.I've had this recipe in an old notebook for some time and I have no idea where it came from, but it works well, and I use it now and again.  It certainly does the job for the eggs...Baked Egg CustardMix together 8 eggs with 4 cups of skimmed milk and 1 cup of sugar.  Add 1 tablespoon of vanilla essence and a pinch of salt.  Put all these into a saucepan and whisk them together - I use a big balloon whisk, but any kind would do.  Don't let the mixture boil but just get it hot, then pour into a large, buttered dish and cook in the oven for 45 - 50 minutes at 150C.  I sprinkle grated nutmeg over ours before I cook it, but that is a matter of choice.  Tomorrow, I should get some quiches made as I went to the village shop today where I saw that they had some tinfoil deep pie dishes, so I am going to use those so that I can freeze the quiches.  I'm going to do some cheese and broccoli and some cheese and bacon.  I'll let you know how I get on later!"},
{"title": "Nanny McPhee and lemon curd", "date": "Saturday 17 April 2010", "text": "Today has been one of those days where everything seemed to happen!  The FH and my UJ went out at about 11, and then I set to making lemon curd.  My friend D came around for a chat, with her son, and stayed about an hour - during which I continued to make the lemon curd whilst we were chatting.  Then they left and we had to scurry around and get ready to leave at 1pm to get to Huntingdon for the 1.50pm screening of Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang.  It is an excellent film, set during WW2, and it was hilarious!  Highly recommended.After that, we came straight home, dropped the YFG off at her friend's house for a sleepover tonight and came home to resume the lemon curd marathon.  Eventually the FH phoned to say that he and UJ were on their way home, and so I started to cook the dinner.  We had a good meal with UJ and he left at about 9.30pm.I made lots of lemon curd - I have about 6 jars left and I have given D and UJ a big jar each and another smaller jar to Jean.  It is the most simple recipe and works like a dream.  Here is the recipe just as I recieved it from the FH's sister in an email:\"I have a very good lemon curd recipe which I set out below - it usually keeps in a cool cupboard until opened and then I keep in the fridge, do not know how long it keeps though as we like it so much it is soon eaten.100g (4oz) butter (I use unsalted)3 eggs225g (8oz) caster sugargrated rind and juice of 3 lemonsIn a medium sized bowl, heat the butter MICROWAVE HIGH for 2 minutes.Beat together the rest of the ingredients and stir into the melted butter.Cook uncovered MICROWAVE HIGH for 5 minutes, stirring well each minute.  When cooked, the curd should be thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon.Pour into sterilized jars, seal and cover.As you will note this is made in the microwave and I can say that it is the easiest, quickest and best lemon curd I have ever made.\"I totally agree - it is a doddle to make, even for someone like me who has never made lemon curd before!  I have more lemons and lots more eggs, so I will be making another couple of batches tomorrow, and then I will be moving on to other egg-based products which I can freeze - cakes and quiches are the first things which spring to mind, although the FH has asked for egg custard as well - the lovely kind with the nutmeg sprinkled on the top.It is strangely quiet without the YFG here tonight...Last bit of news for the night - the Gold Partridge Orpington pen has produced two more eggs on consecutive days AND the Silver Laced Wyandotte hen has laid her first egg today!!  We are making progress in the breeding programme at last."},

Just as well, then, that my neighbour's lovely mother, Jean, flew in from Cyprus on Wednesday evening for a visit.  It was an amazing surprise to see her out with her grandson in the street yesterday and I rushed over to give her a big hug.Yesterday I was in the garden most of the day again!  And today, for some of it, too.  I dug over the vegetable bed on which I had put most of the garden compost - it turned in surprisingly easily so a job I had been putting off for days as I was afraid it was going to be too much like hard work, I actually accomplished in about half an hour.  I was definitely glowing when I had finished!Tomorrow the FH is going out with my uncle for the day so I am going to take the girls and a friend to the cinema - we are going to see Nanny MacPhee's next film.  I think Emma Thompson is a great actress so I am pleased that this is the film that they have chosen to watch.Lots more washing has been done today and it is all dry.  I couldn't face ironing tonight so I have just folded it and sorted it into each person's heap.

This is the first any of that group has laid, so it means that they ARE now old enough to start laying and we can expect them to get up to speed in the next few weeks.I feel like I have achieved a lot today - I got up earlier so I have had more \"day\" to do it in, I suppose, so that helps...I sowed some grass seed on the bare patches of back lawn on Monday and watered it well then with the watering can, quite a few canfuls.  It dried out quite quickly so I have done it again today, and I will probably do it each day now as there is no rain forecast for some days.  I hung some more washing out as the sun was shining and there was a brisk breeze to get the towels dry.  I do love to see washing flapping on a sunny day.  I've been in the greenhouse and potted up the 18 cucumber seedlings that had come through; we are going to be inundated with cucumbers if they are all productive.  Some are a variety called \"Burpless\" and the others are \"Telegraph\" - supposed to be long and straight like telegraph poles, I think.  I also potted up 15 tomato plants of a variety called Sweet Million, which is a cherry tomato.  I then sowed more seeds: melon, two kinds of pepper and two more kinds of tomato - Sungold and Moneymaker.  The gooseberry plants also got potted up this morning as the ground where I want to put them is not yet ready.  They look fine in blue-glazed terracotta pots, in the sun, in front of the verandah.  People will just have to watch when they walk past Invicta and not get too close as she is rather fiercely prickled!This afternoon we had our six monthly check ups at the dentist in town.  The EFG and the FH have to go back for fillings and I need a scale and polish so we are booked to return in June.  Then we headed to the bank and WHSmith and Boots.  I left a prescription there which I will have to pick up another day for the FH - we forgot all about it!  After that, we went to Wisbech, because we wanted to have a look at shoes in Brantano's shop there.  The YFG needed new school shoes, and I had a browse round and found some for myself too so that was a successful time.  We also nipped into other shops as we don't go to Wisbech at all often so we had a bit of a poke around whilst we were there.Since the FH can't drive, UJ came over this morning to help the FH to fetch some pallets for firewood and then they went to the Wednesday lunch as well - and the YFG went along too.  Liver and bacon, lots of veg and mash and then jam sponge pudding - they all came home stuffed!  The FH is finding it rather a struggle not being able to drive and asked if we could go for a ride out somewhere this week, so we came home from Wisbech by a very scenic route and he was happier!"},

She uses the subtitle, \"The true story of one woman's mission to go green\" which gives us all a good grasp of what it is all about.Lock tackles the issues as 37 Challenges, and I thought it would be good for my eco soul, such as it is, to consider how we are measuring up to them and what we could do to improve our carbon footprint.Challenge 1: Can you do without supermarkets?No, I've been here before.  I live in the middle of nowhere and I can manage to go to a good butcher in Upwell, there are veg and fruit on the market in town BUT there is nowhere else to buy the groceries like sugar, flour and margerine, the loo roll and the washing up liquid.  I fail on that one.Challenge 2: The veg box.No, I'm not going there either.  There are loads of veg that we or UJ grow ourselves, and we are reasonable traditional (you can read \"boring\" there if you want to!) in our choices but we don't go too much for the fancy stuff.  There are orchards in the Wisbech area, around Elm, where I buy fruit if I want a lot to preserve, and otherwise I get it from the shop or the market, and I am happy to choose what I want myself.Challenge 3: Organic and localMy budget doesn't run to Organic in anything other than cucumbers, because they taste so much better - and I have a load of seedling cucumbers in the propagator so we won't be buying many this year.  Local - I am all for local - grow your own, barter with neighbours, receive gratefully from friends and family who have excess produce,  I do Local OK!Challenge 4: Does Organic taste better?Cucumbers do.  Can't tell you about anything else.  I would say, though, that my homegrown stuff is as good as organic as we don't put anything on it.  That tastes pretty good!Challenge 5: Can you grow your own?YES!  I Can and I do!  And I want to grow more.....and I \"grow\" my own chicken meat and eggs too.Challenge 6: Ready meals vs proper dinnersShe seems to mean bought, pop-it-in-the-microwave dinners as ready meals, whereas our version of a ready meal is what I made last week as leftovers and froze.  We do those, but I don't think I have ever bought a proper microwave dinner.....Real food here.Challenge 7: Make your ownYogurt?  I can and have but there is little demand for it here so I don't at the moment.Ice cream? HM Lollies I can do, and the FH has a method for making ice cream with tinned cream/milk but it goes very hard!!  Not sure we pass that test.Soup? Used to.  Haven't done for ages - should try again.Bread?  Can do - make a popular French stick, and use the breadmachines sometimes too.Cakes? Most definitely - size of backside attests to that!Preserves? Jam, apple butter, basic marmalade.  Haven't made chutney for ages, but want to make lemon curd this week - bought the lemons!Challenge 8: The milkmanUsed one when we first moved here, but the kids and FH didn't drink enough milk to make it worth while.  He did deliver beautiful English apple juice, though.  We use UHT milk now.Challenge 9: Going veggie - a one week challengeThe EFG was veggie for 6 months, but we have never all been veggie for a week.  Good idea.Challenge 10: Cod and ethical fishSalmon is often tinned from Alaska, tuna is usually dolphin-friendly.  Other fish is frozen.  Will have to look into this situation and report back later.Challenge 11: Cleaning without chemicalsNo, I use chemicals and I know I could do better on this one.  I do use Stardrops diluted a lot of the time, and I use washing soda in the washing powder mixture I make, but I could make much more use of vinegar and bicarb.  Will get some info from Rhonda-Jean's archives and have a go.Challenge 12: Green washingI use the 30C wash, even for whites.  I do line-dry as we don't have a tumble drier.  She talks about soap nuts and eco balls, but I don't use anything like that.My EFG suggests that 12 challenges is enough for tonight and I should resume later in the week.The hedgehog has returned and was seen eating the cat's biscuits tonight - wonderful to know that he has made it through the winter."},

The YFG cut the front lawn today and made a really good job of it.  We gave the clippings to the hens as they love to scratch through them and eat some bugs that they find, as well as eating some of the grass.The FH and I emptied some of the compost bin this evening and the YFG helped to spread the lovely compost onto a couple of the garden beds.  The compost is lovely and rich - it has broken down really well and I was thrilled to have managed to produce such wonderful stuff with which to enrich the garden.  It really is \"Black Gold\".As well as all that in the actual garden, the girls and I went to the garden centre today and bought some fruit bushes.  I got 10 canes each of Autumn Bliss and Malling Jewel raspberries, one Invicta gooseberry bush and one Whinham's Industry, which produces a red gooseberry.  I love to make gooseberry jam so I am hoping that they both turn out to be productive.  All those are currently enjoying a long drink in buckets of water and will be planted tomorrow.The seeds which were sown earlier in the week are beginning to show some shoots - there are some Webb's Wonderful lettuces through, some cucumbers, cress and some tomato seedlings, so I am well pleased with that."},

Beautifully sunny at lunchtime.We have had a lovely day today at Thetford Forest, just on the Norfolk/Suffolk border.  We got held up a little in Brandon and arrived at about 12.00.  Just in time to set ourselves up on the grass for a picnic in the sun.  The weather was great, and the girls had a lovely time.  We went with D and her daughter, T.  T and the YFG are in the same class at school and get on really well.  The EFG mooched along with D and I, sat and read whilst the others were on the climbing wall, and generally had a good laugh.  The wall took up nearly an hour by the time we had queued, had the safety instruction and then they actually climbed.  They both went up and down multiple times and had a really good go at it. After that, we took the picnic kit back to the car and went for a walk in the woods.  The walk was interspersed with the various creature-orientated climbing activities which I photographed - the rabbit, the woodlark, the Pyramid (without a creature!) and the zip wire.  Eventually we made our way back to the base and they had an icecream courtesy of D, and then it was time to head home.  The YFG had a snooze in the car which didn't surprise me at all as she was totally immersed in the activities all day and hardly sat down at all - it was go, go, go with her all day!We'll be back to the Forest in the summer holidays, I think, as they all enjoyed the fresh air, exercise and activities so much, and it is only an hour away - far enough to feel you have been out, but not far enough to be tedious."},
{"title": "Back outside again today", "date": "Thursday 8 April 2010", "text": "High pressure has settled over us and we are promised fine and dry weather for today and three more days - hurray!  The sun was out when I drew back the curtains this morning and so I hurried outside to let the chooks out to enjoy the weather too.The Gold Partridge Orpingtons seem to be settling into their new, segregated home.  The EFG and I had a hilarious half hour last night watching them from the kitchen window whilst we were doing the dishes.  They were thinking about going to roost, then they came out again, looked around and went inside again: we began to imagine what they might be \"saying\" to each other...\"what's it like in there, girls?\" \"not sure I want to go to bed yet, there might just be another morsel of food if I have a scratch around!\" \"move over, girls, I'm coming in!\" \"come on in, it's quite nice in here!\" and then eventually they were all in for the night.Today I have done another couple of loads of washing,and sown some Dwarf French beans in pots in the greenhouse. They are a variety called Ferrari so I am expecting them to grow fast!!  The temperature in the greenhouse was over 40C this afternoon about 2pm when I was planting them so it was Warm in there.Later on this afternoon the girls and I went to town for a couple of hours.  I had a 20% off voucher for WHSmith so they got a book each, some laminating pouches, and I got a copy of Practical Poultry magazine as I hadn't had one for months.  I'm going to be scanning all the breeders adverts but more about that later.  We also had to get some medicine for the FH, put a cheque in the bank, and get some bread rolls for a picnic tomorrow as we are going to Thetford Forest for a walk/play/picnic with my friend D and her daughter.  We can all fit in my car, so we'll be off at about 10.30am.  It's only about an hour from here, so we'll be there in time for lunch, a walk and a play and then come home by about 6pm.The Volvo has been taken off to the garage this afternoon so I am waiting to hear what the damage is going to be.  Hopefully it won't be too bad - a new battery would be a good place to finish.  More expensive \"surgery\" will be avoided if we are lucky!!The poultry breeding.  I spent ages here last night investigating and reading all about critical breeds and rare ones, and came to the conclusion that I would like a challenge - to breed some Brussbar chickens.  These are on the Critical list and I can't find anyone offering any for sale at all via the internet.  They are bred from the Barred Plymouth Rock and the Brown Sussex, and then the next generation females are crossed with a Light Sussex cockerel and then the resulting females are crossed with a Brussbar cockerel (from the first cross) and then the end product is the Brussbar.  You can then take the Golden Brussbar cockerel and cross that with Rhode Island Red hens and end up with a Rhodebar......it's going to be a project of five or six years'  undertaking but it will be interesting and challenging.  I may not have the right information about producing the breed yet, so I am going to keep looking and investigating!  To document it properly, I think I will start another blog which I will use to keep all the information together.  I have ordered the Breeds Standard Book from the Poultry Club from the library this afternoon so that I can find out exactly what the breeds are supposed to look like to help me choose good specimens of each breed.  Would you believe that there is not a copy in any of the county's libraries and the lady said that they would have to ask inter-county loan to find me one - and she had no idea how long that would take!"},
{"title": "More of an indoor day!", "date": "Wednesday 7 April 2010", "text": "This evening has passed quietly as I have been studying the internet for some hours, fascinated with the many breeds of chickens, especially the rare breeds.The FH finished the butchering of the chickens this morning and they are all tucked away in the freezer now.  He went out for lunch although I had to take him: there is the fact that he's not allowed to drive, but his Volvo died as well - we are waiting for Chris from the garage to tow it away to be investigated and repaired.  I cooked homemade chicken nuggets and wedges for the girls, and sweet and sour chicken for myself. This afternoon there was a visit from my friend D so everything stopped whilst we put the kettle on and generally put the world to rights.  We had a good natter and she borrowed some more Katie Fforde books - I've got her started now and she is enjoying them too!  I collected the eggs in this afternoon - only 16 today, but three old Sasso hens were culled so that is 3 less to lay at the moment.  I miscounted yesterday as there were actually 20 eggs laid - AND I found an extra 8 in a cache in the hen run when I went to tidy it up yesterday.  I have tested them for freshness and they were all fine, so 6 of them went into a couple of fruit cakes I made this evening.The gang have fended for themselves tonight; I think that they have had sandwiches for their supper, and I had a small baked potato.  I should have been ironing tonight but my legs ache from the digging yesterday so I didn't get to the ironing yet.....We have decided to have \"No Screens on\" before lunch during the holidays so I am not turning the computer on until at least 2pm, sometimes later, and the girls are not watching TV either.  It means that we are getting more done and they are helping with the chores.  \"What do you want me to do today?\" they say each morning.  About time too!!I am reading Sybil's story (look at her blog in the blogroll on the sidebar) and the EFG is also writing a story - I am waiting for the latest chapter to be emailed to me now.  Wish I could write like they do but I just don't have the imagination!  Got to go to email the FH's sister about the lemon curd now, so see you tomorrow - weather is supposed to be good so hoping to get more done in the garden."},
{"title": "An outdoor kind of day", "date": "Tuesday 6 April 2010", "text": "Today the weather has been glorious - just right for spring. I have washed and line dried five loads of washing, dug over another garden bed and cultivated the other two (ie smashed up the large clods of earth to make a finer tilth), moved the Gold Partridge Orpingtons into their own pen, collected 19 eggs (19 - that's the record for this season - have to start making lemon curd, perhaps!), top-dressed and weeded the soil around the fruit trees in their pots on the back driveway - they are all in bud and I am hoping for more fruit than last year!  I generally pottered about out there all day, coming in for an hour for a lunchbreak and otherwise only to reboot the washing machine and use the loo!  The FH has been out there too - six chickens have been plucked today ready for the freezer, and he has done some woodwork too.  I have done some tidying up in one of the hen runs as well so that they have more scratching areas and a perch.The CPAP machine is not something he is going to get used to in a hurry.  He manages about 5 or 6 hours a night so far, but then has to give up and take it off.  He slept from 5am till 9am today without it, so he is almost sleeping as much without it as he is with it.  I hope he will be able to keep it on for longer periods of time the more practise he has with it.The chick is doing well and beginning to get feathers on the wings now - must take another photo tomorrow.This evening, after we ate, the girls and I went to Tesco.  It has been horrible to go during the day last week as people were buying like mad in the run-up to Easter, so it was refreshing to be able to walk the aisles tonight without being hindered."},
{"title": "Happy Easter!", "date": "Sunday 4 April 2010", "text": "He is risen!  Hallelujah!I am up, but the FH has had a bad night with the CPAP machine.  I just leapt out of bed and said, \"Come on, we'll be late for church,\" to which he replied that his chest hurts and he feels full of air from the machine, and he's going nowhere.  I know he had to take it off at about 5am, so I think I'll have to phone the ward at the hospital and get some advice today.Anyway, I am hoping to get myself and the girls to church by 9.30am, so I had better go and start on the morning chores.  Have already turned the eggs in the incubators, and the chick looks fine, I'm pleased to report.  It was very vocal last night, so we gave it a small soft-toy duck for company!"},
{"title": "Welcome home", "date": "Saturday 3 April 2010", "text": "The FH is home, and very tired!! A night in a hospital bed is never a very restful one, and sharing a room with two other men didn't help either.  He seems to have spent a lot of time chatting with a farmer, and being disturbed by the third man's monitors' alarms going off.  The FH and the farmer were only in there for the CPAP machine initiation, whereas the third man was seriously ill, and apparently turned blue in the night and had to have quite some suction to his airways on several occasions. We will have to try the machine tonight at home and hopefully we will get used to it.  The doctor has told the FH that he MUST persevere with it, whatever the difficulties, because his problem is so bad. The second chick is beginning to show normal chick behaviours now, which is reassuring.  It is pecking at the food, drinking from the water bowl and preening a little too.  It will probably survive now.  There are now 24 Gold-laced Orpington eggs in the two incubators. Weather report - not as bad as was forecast!  Some sun, so I am heading out now to pootle in the greenhouse for a while.  The FH is watching the Oxford/Cambridge boat race on the Thames.  We're rooting for Cambridge!"},

The other is still struggling on, but all we can do is watch and hope for it to survive.  I'm not over the moon about having another \"only\" chick again, though.The FH is at the hospital - we dropped him off and came home.  UJ has come to tea and enjoyed fish and chips (HM of course) with the girls, I had chicken and chips.  He is now watching the TV and I am about to join him, with a cuppa.  Good night, all!These chicks are both very weak this morning.  The second, unphotographed chick has still not made it onto its feet, and indeed, its toes have not splayed out so that it can stand on them.  We are beginning to wonder about the viability of this chick and whether it is deformed.  Sad but real, I'm afraid. The second chick is moving around, but not showing much of the normal chick behaviours yet, so we are keeping our fingers crossed for that one.  I have given them both water this morning from a pipette and I have dipped their beaks into the water bowl in the box, so that might encourage them a little. Apart from that, the FH is having a bath and getting his bag packed for the hospital.  I have telephoned as instructed, to make sure that there is a bed available for him, so it is all systems go on that front."},
{"title": "Meet a chick", "date": "Thursday 1 April 2010", "text": "I'm not sure whether this is a Mack or a Mabel, but it is cute anyway.  I've cropped the picture as the other chick was on its back in a rather undignified position, so I thought I'd preserve its dignity a little and just show you all this one.The FH has been suffering from excessive tiredness for some time now, months, indeed.  I have engineered him to get a referral from the GP to a sleep clinic, as I suspected he was stopping breathing when he slept.  I was right: he went to Papworth Sleep Clinic on Tuesday to fetch an oxygen monitor which he had to have clipped to his finger all night.  We went to Papworth to see the doctor yesterday, and the print out from the monitor revealed that his breathing is stopping up to FORTY TIMES AN HOUR!  Oh, my word!  That was a bit of a shock - I thought it was maybe once or twice each night, nowhere near as bad as that.  So, he has to go tomorrow overnight to be supplied with a CPAP machine which, I think, will supply a fixed pressure of air into his windpipe whilst he sleeps so that it can't collapse and stop him breathing.  The first night is done under supervision in the hospital, and we were very lucky that they let him go in this week - the receptionist said it would be any time in the next six weeks, but then I said we would accept a cancellation spot and wanted it done asap, and she said, \"Well, is this Friday too soon?\" to which I replied that it most certainly was not!  He is not allowed to drive until the treatment starts to work, so we have to inform the DVLA, which I should do tomorrow.  I have to take him back to the hospital tomorrow for 1.30pm and then pick him up again on Saturday morning, with his machine.  I'm looking forward to having a more alert husband back soon!Today has been a whirlwind - I took the EFG to a different hospital to see a pediatrician about some growth issues, then called in on my sister to pick up her Easter gifts for the girls, dropped off a leotard to another friend in the town, headed off north to the other town to a menswear shop to buy the FH some PJs for his hospital stay and then picked up the YFG from school before finally making it home at about 3.10pm.  It was a long day in the car!When we got home, the two chicks hadn't made it out of the eggshells properly, so we gave them a little helping hand and they are both OK now.  One has made it onto its feet, but the other is still rolling around on its back as its legs haven't really gained their strength yet.  Both have loud cheeps, and we are hearing them all over the house.  I am going to sort out the box and the light for them before I go to bed and maybe move them over later on, but I might leave it until the morning, depending on how they seem at about 10pm.Got up a little while ago to find that the Sebright eggs (2) are beginning to hatch.  I sat here at the computer last night and was sure I heard a cheep but looked at the eggs and decided that no, they weren't \"due\" until Friday so I must have been imagining things!  This morning as I sat here, I heard it again, and rushed to look - one egg is moving a little and the other has a big hole in it where I can see a chick's foot and that chick is the one cheeping!!  Hatch one day early......more news later."},
{"title": "Hatchery set to go", "date": "Tuesday 30 March 2010", "text": "The Sebright eggs in the incubator have only days left to go until their hatch is supposed to happen, and tonight I have successfully bid on some Gold laced Oprington eggs, from the same man I had some from last year.  I won 2 lots of 12, and he has emailed to say he will let me have another 6 included in that price, so that's 18 eggs.  This is the same breed as the lovely Coco, so we are hoping that they will hatch successfully....I'm going to pick them up tomorrow.We have been making poultry plans and the FH has been out to buy some wood to build me a new chicken shed.  Well, I knew I was saving all that money for something!  Seriously, though, we priced the size of shed I want with local shed manufacturers, and they were coming in at between £650 and £900, so the paltry amount the wood has cost me today is nothing.  I shall have to turn joiner's labourer for a few days, I know, but 'tis worth it to get the breeds segregated so that I can start hatching our own eggs.I found a great recipe for hot cross buns on an Australian savings website, so I am going to try it tomorrow.  If it works, I'll share it!  Must also borrow my neighbour's camera again so that I can take a photo of the buns. Tomorrow is the EFG's last day of term, and I got her report today - excellent and well on target, so I am very pleased with her hard work.  Most of the teachers have chosen the \"Excellent attitude to learning\" although one or two have gone for the \"Good attitude to learning\" choice.  The Geography teacher says that she is working at level 6, when the target is only level 5, so she is exceeding his target, yet he has only given her the \"Good\" rather than the \"Excellent\" so I am not sure where he's coming from.    I know how hard she works, so I am pleased."},
{"title": "The poultry auction", "date": "Sunday 28 March 2010", "text": "The family returned from the auction at about 4pm, with a box of unsold cockerels in the car.  Unfortunately, we had sexed them and got it wrong.  What we thought was a hen was in fact a cockerel so instead of entering a Pair of Buff Orps, I had sent a couple of boys along, and the auctioneer's staff had put a notice on the pen saying that they couldn't be sold.  On a happier note, the two Buff Sussex hens, two Barnevelder hens and two Black Orpington hens all sold, for at least £30 each pair, so I am pleased.  I know the auction house will take its cut, but I should have a nice cheque coming my way within two weeks. There were no Gold Partridge Orps in the auction at all, so I think that they might be the kind to breed!  The cockerels are back in the pen here with their third brother, and have settled in for the night now. My dad and MB came over this afternoon for a visit, and then UJ has phoned this evening, too.  My sister is going into hospital tomorrow to have her bunion \"done\" so I must phone her on Tuesday to see if there is anything I can do for her.  Gym is finished until 20th April, and the girls finish school on Wednesday (EFG) and Thursday (YFG) so we are on the home run to Easter now - hooray!!Changing the clocks forward last night has made me sleepy and it is only 9.30pm so I am about to head for bed.Yes, the final shopping trip happened yesterday:2 tins cat food 90ptin tuna 45pbox frozen fish (4 pieces) 2.00mozarella 47pBOGOF cheese (so 2 x 400g packs) 3.99bag small apples 1.34Total - 9.15That left enough to buy some small Easter treats for friends at school - another £3.By my calculations, that leaves me 16p from the original £100 for the church collection next Sunday........as long as we don't spend it in the meantime.  I'm not tight enough to just put 16p in the collection - I will put our usual amount in as well.This has shown us that it is possible to do this, to eat well and not feel that we have struggled to find food to eat when we have plenty of ingredients in the house.  I will be honest, the girls have said that there was \"nothing\" to eat occasionally, but that has been because they have seen a lack of ready-prepared, ready-to-eat stuff.  When I have pointed out to them that they could make a sandwich, have some fruit or pop some corn, they have seen that there has been food to eat!  Similarly, the fridges have had a little less \"Stuff\" in them - I have kept the bacon frozen to avoid it being eaten as bacon sandwiches for breakfast every day, I have bought less ham/pepperami for sandwiches and pizzas because in my experience they don't get kept for the sandwiches and pizzas as they get eaten too easily as snacks!The family has gone to take the poultry to the auction today near Mildenhall, so I knew last night that I had to make them all a packed lunch.  So yesterday at the shops, I made sure I had some fruit (the apples) and some sandwich filling (some of the cheese) and then yesterday evening, I made some lemon madeira cakes with some lemons I had had here for while and needed using up.  I also used up the end of a bag of mixed dried fruit and made the FH a fruit cake.  They have gone off with enough food to keep them going for the day, and then they will have their chicken dinner when they get home this afternoon.I can see an online order coming from Asda in the near future to restock the pantry!  I have enjoyed this challenge, and the bank balance has benefitted from me not going shopping and spending £50-£65 each week.  There has also been less wastage which can only be a good thing.  We will have to try to keep doing all the good points, and learn from the whole experience.The book will be flying northwards to Susan - thanks to you, Susan, and Toria for entering your great recipes.  They will both be featuring on the menu here in April.  Can't say which of Katie Fforde's books you will be getting, Susan, until I get to the shops/Amazon and see what there is in stock - they are all good!

She's made a new email penpal in Indiana who also loves gymnastics and is 10, watched some TV, played some games on the computer, eaten some cake, been out with her dad for a wee while, and we've been to gym tonight.  I was operating on just an apple and a sausage - almost running on empty - so I was a bit fragile, but I am doing OK.  I rested up during the day somewhat, reading and just pottering, rather than trying to work my way through a list of chores the way I usually do.  I did make some more French sticks this morning, but that was about the limit of my energies!I'm off to bed now to finish a book over a cup of tea. G'night all!"},

As it happened, there were a few things that we needed, so I made a little list: a bag of apples, a jar of cheap lemon curd, a packet of sliced ham, some broccoli and a bar of chocolate for me for a cake I want to make later on in the week, perhaps at the weekend.The bag which was brought back is slightly different: a \"reduced\" wholemeal loaf 40p, Gale's lemon curd 99p, the bar of chocolate 1.19, ham 2.75, \"reduced\" braising steak 3.60 and the apples, £1.  Alas, no broccoli.  But bread and meat which were unrequested and un-needed since we have enough of both in the freezer.  So his total spend, with the potatoes, is now £13.92.This brings my available pot of money for the remainder of the time down to just £12.31.  There's not going to be a lot left! Thank goodness that there are just 9 days left of this challenge.  I can see that I will have to buy Easter eggs on Easter Sunday for the girls - hope that there are a couple left somewhere...Good news is that I have a whole leg of lamb in the freezer for Easter Sunday lunch, bought some time ago, reduced of course!"},

Good job that today the FH went out for his lunch and the girls have taken advantage of those two portions of lasage that were left over last week and frozen.This kind of thing often hits me at the end of a term and I feel that it is my body's way of saying, \"Whoa! You need to rest NOW!\" and because it usually comes along with diarrhoea which keeps me housebound, I do rest.  I have done very little today at all - this morning I helped the FH sort out some bit and pieces for about half an hour and then when he went out, I sent him with a shopping list.  I sat down and watched a DVD and snoozed.  I snoozed much of the afternoon and have had more sleep in the chair by the fire since they have eaten tonight.  I am reading a thick book, and not doing much at all.  The ironing heap is getting bigger, as is the washing heap, and the floor could do with a hoovering, but it won't get done by me at the minute.  I felt that I was letting people down last night when I was unable to go and help out at gymnastics, but there was no way I could go.  Luckily for her, a friend gave the YFG a lift so she didn't miss out completely.I have sent my apologies for a meeting I was scheduled to attend tonight, rearranged the next couple of days' work with the FH and generally cleared the decks so that I have some time to recover - I am hibernating!!"},
{"title": "Toria's recipe - keep 'em coming!", "date": "Tuesday 23 March 2010", "text": "\"This is my go to recipe, made from things we always have in the  cupboard.Tomato & Tuna PastaChop an onion and saute in olive  oil until just soft. (I buy onions in bulk, prechop them & freeze, so that  counts as cupboard to me).Turn up the heat & add a can of tomatoes.  (Note: for just 2 people use a small can, for a family use a larger can or 2  small cans, this is an easy recipe to modify the number of servings). If your  can is not chopped, then prechop, otherwise just throw it in. Cook the tomatoes  on high for about 10 mins. Flavour with a bay leaf & some pepper (lemon  pepper if you have it)Open a can of tuna & drain. I prefer the tuna  in oil, but have made this with the ones packed in water as well. I've also made  it with flavoured tuna once (chilli), when it was all I had in the cupboard.  Again, choose your size - use a 95g tin for just 2, a larger can for serving  more.Lower the heat & stir the tuna through. Cook for about 5 to 10  mins. Fish out the bay leaf when done. Stir some freshly chopped parsley through  if you have some, but don't fret it if you don't.Meanwhile, bring a pot  of water to the boil & cook some pasta. I prefer linguine with this, but  will use what is in the cupboard.Drain pasta & serve.\"Thanks for taking part!The EFG and I have just candled the Gold-laced Sebright eggs which I have been nurturing in the incubator.  Two look like there may be a chance that something will hatch but the other three are not fertile and we have discarded them.  However, I have continued to collect and keep separate all the other eggs that the bantam has laid and do have four more - when I have six, I will pop them into another incubator and give them a go too. The recipes are not flooding in, so come on!  Dig out those family favourites and let's share them!!"},

Thanks, Susan, I'm looking forward to trying this out when I can get to the shops to buy some curry powder or paste!\"Hello Fen family - I'd love to share the Mackay family curry sauce receipe. It's  really simple to make, easy to adapt to whats in the cupboard and made from  basic storecupboard ingredients.For the basic sauce (serves  3-4)Roughly chop 2 largish onions, 2 cloves of garlic & 1 chilli (this  can be omitted if you don't want it too hot!)fry until softened but not coloured  in oil. Add approx 4 heaped teaspoons of your prefered curry paste (we usually  have madras) or curry powder to taste & fry for another couple of minutes.  Fling in a tin of chopped tomatoes and about 1/2 tin of water & a stock cube  (veg or chicken) and leave to simmer until the onions are soft.Now comes  the fun bit - liquidise (I us a stick blender in the pan and usually end up  wearing some of it!) this gives you a lovely smooth basic curry sauce like the  local takeaway and can be adapted depending on what is in the  cupboard/fridge.Add a sachet of creamed coconut for a ceylon  curry.A dollop of mango chutney for a patia type curry.For a  creamier version add 2 or 3 spoons of natural yogurt at the end of cooking and a  handful of fresh coriander.Add any type of fresh meat/fish/veg or  leftovers.I usually make a double batch of the basic sauce and freeze  half.Yum feeling quite hungry now....Susan in Scotland - where  it actually feels like spring hurray!!!\"Today is the day - the 400th post.  I thought that if I made the post first thing on a Monday morning, I would give everyone who reads a few days to enter my giveaway. Let's share some favourite recipes - what does your family love to eat?  What do you love to make for them?  Perhaps you could share your best time-saving recipe or the one you make when the cupboard looks bare....Send the recipes in as comments and I will publish them here so we can all try them out.  On Friday 27th March, I'll pick a name out to win a Katie Fforde novel.  I can't say which one yet as it will depend on which one the bookstores in town have in stock, but they are all great!  It will be a good reminder for us all that busy mums and cooks need to put our feet up now and again and relax with a good book - and I will send this one anywhere, so don't be shy!"},
{"title": "A slow day", "date": "Sunday 21 March 2010", "text": "We're all a little bit off kilter today.  We've pottered around and not been anywhere much at all, and seen no-one except neighbours.  I cooked the chicken for lunch and we ate at about 2pm, and then eventually had a snack-ish tea at nearly 8pm.  The girls are tucked up in bed now and I am shortly to follow them.The FH has hurt his ankle again and so he is hobbling around on crutches.  It is bandaged up but it feels better when it has weight on it so he is not putting it up on a stool but keeping it on the floor.  He has had to spend most of the day watching TV in front of the fire - it's a hard life.  I have done some baking this afternoon - a sponge cake for tea, the Viennese biscuits for the YFG in particular and some chocolate slab cake for everyone.  The chickens have done me proud - 10 eggs today, including two bantam eggs."},
{"title": "Revisions", "date": "Saturday 20 March 2010", "text": "I have been having a bit of a rummage in the freezer this afternoon.  There are spends to update in a minute, and I was beginning to get concerned that we weren't going to make it through as we were running out of meat.  I should have dug deeper sooner! Current list of meat in freezer:Chicken quarters (3 in bag)2 portions HM lasagne leftovers2 meals' worth of meatballs2 pkts my sausages (ie Free From)1 pkt chicken livers1 pkt Quorn mince1 pkt Quorn chicken-style pieces3 packs bacon rashers1 bag cooked turkey1 pkt sausages.So, I thought that I would postpone tonight's plan for meatballs as they have loomed large on the menu lately, and cook the Quorn mince instead - very handy for when I have forgotten to take anything out for dinner and it very conveniently cooks from frozen.  I can't eat it, so I'll probably have some fish as there are two small pieces in the freezer.Yesterday I spent £2.50 on mandarin oranges (2 for £2.50 offer) and today I have had to buy Clover spread (£2), Vitalite (98p) and cheese (400g block of ligher Cathedral City for £3.99).  Total there - £9.47 leaving £26.23 in the pot, and exactly two weeks to go.Given what we have available, the menu for this week ahead is going to include:Monday - turkey pie (puff pastry in freezer)Tuesday - FH to cook - pasta with sauce and grated cheeseWednesday - meeting at 8pm - Toad in the HoleThursday - Bacon pie (my concoction - bacon and onion on a base of mash, covered with beaten eggs and a smidgen of grated cheese)Friday - FH to cook - Jacket potato nightSaturday - Chicken quarters, roasties, vegSunday - poultry auction - Quick meal - meatballs and spaghetti with tomato sauceToday I think that the past week and the very long day at the gym competition last Sunday has finally caught up with me as I feel absolutely shattered.   Gym this morning was fine and we started working the older girls on some new things, which pleased them, and it kept me challenged too.  After picking up the shopping from Tesco, I was ready to come home and go to bed!  I did as well - which was lovely until I got a phone call and sat there chatting for about 15 minutes so I decided that I might as well get up.  I think I'll be early to bed tonight......."},
{"title": "So how's the menu plan?", "date": "Friday 19 March 2010", "text": "It's working out, little by little. Tuesday was the Corned Beef dish, Wednesday was the unplanned lasagne, yesterday was the haddock meal and tonight will be the frying steak with wedges.  Tomorrow will probably be the meatballs and then the roast chicken on Sunday.  I do like a roast dinner on a Sunday! The lunchboxes are doing OK as well - the YFG is enjoying the banana bread and the EFG the carrot cake.  There was no fruit that the YFG likes left this morning, so she has had a cut-up carrot, and she loved the jelly she had yesterday.  I was worried about the packing up whilst we were on the challenge as the YFG has fads in which she will love something for ages and then suddenly take a dislike to it.  That's fine if I know that she is fed up with something but it becomes a pain when I don't realise!  She usually asks for the item again within a few months, so I think that she just wants a change.  I'm planning some Viennese biscuits from here this weekend so I hope that some of them make it through to Monday to perk up the lunchboxes for a day or two.Breakfasts are plodding along in a bit of a repetitive fashion - the FH has porridge most days, the EFG toast and the YFG one of hot cheese sandwiches, eggy bread or a sandwich.  I'm on whatever I can find - sometimes leftovers, sometimes I treat myself to a sausage, occasionally I open a value tin of broken grapefruit and that lasts me a couple of days."},
{"title": "Gardening again", "date": "Thursday 18 March 2010", "text": "After a quick trip to town this morning to make a delivery and see a friend, I have really spent the rest of the day in the garden!  Tidying up has been the name of the game: vacant chicken houses have been spruced up and put into storage, empty rabbit houses have been cleaned and put back into use as the buck called Guiness has been evicted from his penthouse which is due for demolition soon, so he had to find a new home.  He is snuggled down in the straw tonight and has made himself very much at home already.  I have also moved lots of odd bits and pieces which were lying around and generally tidied up everywhere.  The yard looks much better, and I feel brighter for all the fresh air!The EFG's after school class was cancelled today but she didn't find out until after her bus had already left, so the YFG and I made a quick dash to pick her up, and then we gave her friend a lift home to the other end of the town too. Tea tonight was the smoked haddock kind of dish - it ended up as a vegetable risotto with the smoked haddock cooked and then flaked through the rice - I thought it was nice, and it was certainly all eaten!"},
{"title": "Menu update", "date": "Wednesday 17 March 2010", "text": "The YFG demanded lasagne last night on the way home from gym.  She doesn't often make known strong views on food, being a happy-go-lucky kind of kid most of the time, but she said she thought that she \"needed\" some!  You will have seen that there were no mince-based meals on the menu, as there was no mince in the freezer - so I had to do a little shopping today.  £3 spent on 700g mince.  I made a big lasagne which fed the three of them for supper and two large portions went straight into the freezer before they could be eaten as seconds!  I also had a portion myself but I took mine out before it was made into lasagne and just served it with rice.  That spend means £37.70 left.I made a banana cake in one of the bread machines this afternoon to use up some very ripe fruit, and I have made up some jelly tonight, both in an attempt to make something more interesting for the lunchboxes tomorrow.In the garden today, I have dug over one of the veg beds as the sun was shining and it was a lovely day to be outside.  Some of the dead plants that were hanging around in the greenhouse also got composted, and it was cute to see the cat asleep on the bench in the sun in there too.This is the 394th post, so I shall have to think what I might do to celebrate the 400th which will surely come soon.  Perhaps another giveaway - what can I find to give??Yesterday was a busy but good day.  I had errands to run in the town in the morning - no spending for the challenge, thank goodness, but bills to pay and things to do.  I came home to a lovely baked potato for my lunch which the FH had popped in for me, and then I sat down and put my feet up for half an hour before it was time to go and get the YFG from school and head out to gymnastics for the evening.We put the big airtrack up for the children as they haven't been able to have that out lately as it is in the way when we are training for competitions.  They love it and had a great time on it last night - sometimes just having fun and sometimes doing some good gymnastics!!  A photographer came in from the local paper at 6pm as the classes changed over so that we could get a photo taken with some of the children and a cheque for the money we have raised for the DEC Haiti Appeal - £1,383.85.  They did so well to raise that much, and blasted through the total of £1000 that we had said we wanted to aim for.  I think that will be in the paper next week, so we'll keep our eyes peeled for that!!In the garden, the garden beds are drying out and I want to get another one or two dug over this week/weekend.  The glorious sunny weather means that I can also line-dry the washing, so I am washing everything which looks the slightest bit grotty!  There are five Gold-laced Seabright eggs in the incubator and we will be candling them at the weekend, so I am crossing everything that at least a couple are going to prove to be fertile.  I'm going to order some more eggs from Steph this week so that I may be able to get them in the incubator to hatch a week or 10 days after these ones."},

The hens have laid half a dozen eggs today between them, so the FGs will be able to have fried eggs, eggy bread, etc for their breakfasts. I still have carrots, parsnips, cabbage, broccoli, apples and bananas left from the last shopping trip.  I was also given some lovely cooking apples by an older gentleman at the band practice this evening - cue apple crumble any day very soon!!I am just now baking some carrot cake and some bread rolls for lunchboxes this week and the smells coming from the kitchen are tantalising!!What a weekend!!  We had extra training again on Saturday and then came home to get everything prepared to go out early on Sunday.  It was a really early start, and we left here at about 7.30am to meet up with some people to whom we were giving a lift to Peterborough; we had a carful - another coach, a gymnast and the gymnast's dad as well us the YFG and I.  We arrived at the venue in plenty of time, and picked out a good spot for the YFG to sit and spectate for the sessions where I would be looking after gymnasts and she would have to sit and watch.The six girls we had in the first session were all there bright and early, full of beans!  It was a good morning, and they collected some medals, too.  The second session also went well, but only 2 of the six girls in the that group medalled.  The other four were taking part in a huge group of 30 gymnasts and tried hard, but didn't manage to win anything.  Then the YFG's turn came, along with 13 of our other gymnasts - four boys were also included in this group.  They looked very smart in their new club T-shirts.  This group was the most successful of the day, with every gymnast gaining at least one medal, some of them two and some even three or four!! Last year the total was 34 medal, including 11 golds, and we at the club were pretty pleased with that.  This year, however, we managed to get 49 medals: 24 golds, 19 silver and 6 bronze.  The YFG got herself a gold on the vault and a silver on the beam, so she was very pleased and I was so proud!!The timing of the whole day over-ran considerably so we finally returned home last night at about 10.15pm.  The YFG had a quick cheese toastie and hit the hay - a thoroughly exhausted girl!"},

I'll have to have a rummage in the freezer to find something to replace it on Saturday, but it is possible that it will be pasta with home-made frozen tomato sauce, or perhaps a vegetarian lasagne with that same sauce - there are lots of pots of it in the freezer!!"},
{"title": "Government recommendations - do we measure up?", "date": "Monday 8 March 2010", "text": "Prima magazine is running an article this month about spending and saving, so I turned straight to that page, of course!It says that the UK Government recommends that we use our income in these proportions:32% living costs (food, clothing, transport, childcare, education and healthcare)25% housing costs (mortgage/rent, council tax and utility bills)18% entertainment (eating out, alcohol, tickets to cinema/theatre/events, days out and hotel costs)17% taxes (national insurance and income tax)4% pension contributions, savings and loan repayments4% insurance - life, health, home and car.I was, as you can imagine, very interested to see how we measure up to this.We come in under budget on living costs, housing costs, entertainment (you just knew we would on that one, didn't you!!), and taxes.  We put a much higher proportion into savings, and we spend a little more on insurance, probably because we insure two cars and a motorhome!!It was eye-opening to find that they would expect people to spend so much on entertainment - Amy Dacyzyn would have a fit!!  Like her, I would much rather do something that I enjoy which also contributes to the household by saving money than go sit on a beach for two weeks doing nothing!You might want to check out how your family's spending compares with the guidelines."},
{"title": "A day in the garden", "date": "Sunday 7 March 2010", "text": "The high pressure is continuing to settle over the UK and we had another bright, clear day today.  I have been tidying up in the garden, cleaning out chicken houses and digging over a raised bed in the veg patch - only 4 more to do.  I have moved some of the chickens into smaller, separate houses as they have been entered into a Spring Poultry Auction on 28th March, so I needed to get them a little less muddy than they have been!!  Three Buff Orpingtons, two Black Orpingtons, two Barnevelders, two Buff Sussex and the pair of Silver Laced Wyandottes are on their way to new homes in three weeks' time.The girls have been on the computers and also outside on the trampoline today.  The EFG cleaned out some rabbit hutches with the YFG assisting.  Then their friend T came around and they all sat on the trampoline together, and I could hear their laughter in the house.  Good times all round."},
{"title": "Beginning to wonder if we can make this through!", "date": "Saturday 6 March 2010", "text": "I am beginning to feel like we are \"struggling in the fens\" at the moment.  The FH looked into the fridges last night and commented that he hoped I would be shopping today as there was nothing in the fridge...well, \"nothing\" that was instantly edible is what I think he meant! There was some baking margerine, some Clover for spreading, apple butter, some milk, some sweet potatoes, and some lard.  So, yes, I did shop today, and I did spend more than I had hoped to spend:Reduced price wholemeal loaf 19pCondensed soup for pasta bake 37p2 corned beef @ 1.32 each so 2.64Reduced price wholemeal loaf 45pMozzarella 47pBranston beans 3 for £1Mature Cheddar 500g packs 2 for £5Dove's Farm flour for me £1.88Vitalite 98pGreen grapes 2 for £3Mandarins 2 for £2.50Savoy cabbage 50pBag of apples £1.64670g broccoli for £1.74Mushrooms 79pI was given a Tesco bag full of beautiful Picasso potatoes this afternoon, which will be used for baked potatoes, wedges and roasties as they are gorgeous!  Thanks, A!Hoping that I am adding that up right, it comes to £23.15.  The kitty is looking seriously depleted now, with only £53.66 left for the remaining four weeks of the challenge - that amounts to just about £13.40 per week. Last week's menu plan worked well, except that the vegetable risotto became a home-made pizza and the planned pizza today has had to become tuna pasta bake, hence the tin of condensed soup bought today.This week's plan:Sunday: Roast chicken, stuffing balls, roast potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, green beans and parsnipsMonday: Chicken leftovers and vegetable risottoTuesday: Shepherd's Pie (I have a huge pack of mince so half will be today's SP and half will become Wed's dinner)Wednesday: LasagneThursday: Baked potatoes and beansFriday: HM PizzaSaturday: Meatballs and spaghetti.I am now thinking that I am going to have to work a little harder to use what I have here in stock if I am going to get through to the end of this challenge successfully.  The ideas I have had so far include making our own bread, and increasing the meatless meals in the week.  There is still quite a bit of meat in the freezer, and four chooks on death row to supplement that, but that probably wouldn't last to the end.  Buying meat would take a big chunk of the budget so I am going to look at more tuna based meals as well!  Any ideas would be welcome....Apart from all that, it has been an interesting week.  I have done several book fairs, been to the Women's World Day of Prayer service yesterday lunchtime, been to gym as usual, and read an excellent book.  \"Winter Solstice\" by Rosamund Pilcher is a lovely, heart warming read and I couldn't put it down!!"},
{"title": "UFOs in Fenland tonight", "date": "Wednesday 3 March 2010", "text": "We were coming home from town at about 7.15pm tonight when the YFG said that there were strange lights in the sky and I should look.  I explained that when one is driving, one should really be looking at the road ahead and not trying to look at lights off to the right in the sky!\"Yes, but Mum, they're UFOs!\" says she.\"No, they're probably just aeroplanes from the RAF,\" I suggest.\"But you don't KNOW,\" it went on, \"So they are UFOs because we don't know what they are.  They could be helicopters, too.\"  So yes, I agreed that since we couldn't identify them, they were UFOs.  Anything for a quiet life!Today has been a cold but clear day, and we've been out and about.  The FH has been to his weekly lunch, with his friends.  One friend has sent me five duck eggs to put in the incubator - that is going to be interesting as I will need to find out how long to incubate them and at what temperature.  Not sure what he wants to do with the ducklings if we are successful!!"},

Total remaining in the \"pot\" is £76.81.The sun continued to shine today!!  High pressure is dominating the weather charts at the moment, long may it continue..."},
{"title": "1st March", "date": "Monday 1 March 2010", "text": "March has arrived as a perfect Spring day!  The sun has been shining beautifully this morning, and the views across the fields are great - we seem to be able to see for miles - a great antidote to the rain and misty mornings we have been having.  AND I actually hung some washing out on the line so fingers are firmly crossed that it gets properly dry.  To aid the celebration of Spring, I was delighted to find two eggs in the Seabright house this morning - so I am thinking about booting up the incubator at the weekend.  If I can get half a dozen eggs from her, I will definitely do it.  The cock bird is treading her regularly so I would think that they might be fertile!I bought the mozarrella cheese this morning for the pizzas later in the week, costing 47p as predicted, which brings the total remaining down a little further to £80.29.The water levels in the Fen drains are higher than I have seen them before, which is testament to the heavy and persistent rains we have had here lately.  I am hoping and praying that the rain eases up now as the time is coming to begin to prepare the garden beds for planting, and the chicken runs desperately need to dry out too."},
{"title": "Food in the week ahead on the challenge", "date": "Sunday 28 February 2010", "text": "Thinking about the week ahead, I am going to be out of time nearly everyday.  It is World Book Day on Thursday and I have three book events to do for schools as well as organising the FH in his drops round the preschools and nurseries.  Add to that the gym sessions for the week, Women's World Day of Prayer service on Friday lunchtime and picking up the girls from after school activities and it all gets a bit fuzzy!The menu looks like this so far:Monday: Macaroni cheese and broccoli bakeTuesday: Pasta and sauceWednesday: Chicken casseroleThursday: Vegetable rissottoFriday: Corned Beef HashSaturday: HM PizzasTwo pasta days consecutively is unusual, but this week there is hardly time to eat let alone cook on occasional evenings, so we just have to go for things which are quick to prepare and filling without being fancy!  The only thing that I can see being bought for that menu is mozzarella cheese for the pizzas, and that costs about 47p.  We'll need fruit later in the week, but we are OK this end.  It is the lunchbox fruit and veg which is the hardest for the YFG - she hates oranges, loves grapes, will only take a couple of bites out of a whole apple but won't allow me to cut one up for her.  She will take a carrot though, so it looks like she may be taking more carrots at the moment, as the budget would be severely stretched if I tried to give her grapes every day.  The EFG on the other hand, loves oranges, clementines, etc and happily takes two each day.I have made a sponge cake for tea, but now I need to go and make some carrot cake for the snacks and lunchboxes.  I am also going to see if I can find a packet of digestive biscuits lurking anywhere - if I can, then refrigerator cake could be on the plan this week as well."},
{"title": "Spending update", "date": "Saturday 27 February 2010", "text": "All this economising means that I am baking a little more so since the girls in the garden are not yet in full production, I had to buy some eggs today - and I also managed to find a couple of loaves of bread at very reduced prices.  Today's shopping basket at Tesco:Wholemeal loaf 19pMalted brown loaf 15pCinammon bun for YFG 89pValue eggs 2.98 (Yes, I have some guilt over this, but I am being very kind to my chickens, so I can't have it both ways - and 30 eggs for this price makes a big difference to the budget!)So that lot came to £4.21, and then I bought a big bag each of carrots and parsnips on the way home from the stall at the roadside, at £1 a bag, so another £2 to add to the total.So £6.21 spent and thus a remaining balance of £80.76.And how has the menu plan been progressing?  Quite well, really!  The YFG was out for tea on Thursday, so the remaining three of us all had chicken curry, meaning that there was none left for me to have as leftovers on Friday.  I had cold corned beef instead, with potatoes and veggies, so that was OK.  Today, the Toad in the Hole has been eagerly awaited and all eaten, and we have a chicken out of the freezer for tomorrow.  I'll have a root around in the freezers and start to think about next week's plan tomorrow.Other happenings this week have included our neighbour's mum, J, returning to Cyprus after an extended holiday here since the beginning of December.  We will miss her, as I am sure that they will, and we hope that she gets safely home tonight.Dad has been having various tests at the doctor's since his return home, and to add to his problems, the starter motor on his car died this morning, so he is not happy!  I bought some vegetables for him at the stall today, so I may have to take them over to him later in the week.The chickens are rather muddy again - frosty weather has its merits as it freezes the ground and makes life easier for them.  Heavy rain has made the hen run rather muddy and I fear that tomorrow's forecast downpours will not help matters.  I'm really hoping for a drier month in March!!The preacher booked to come to take our service in the morning has been taken ill so the steward spoke to me last night and asked me to take the service.  At short notice, I have prepared a service in the last hour and a half, and I am hoping that it will run OK.  The YFG has declared that the last one I took was \"boring\" so I hope that this one is more interesting for her.  Perhaps I work better under pressure!We are all working hard at gymnastics to prepare the children for the competition they are entering on 14 March.  We are taking about 28 or 29 children this year, so we are pressed for time for practising; to that end, we had an extra hour at gym today, so we were training until 2pm, and we will do that for the next two Saturdays.  It doesn't sound like much, but an hour makes all the difference to how much we get done in the session.Off to bed now - goodnight all!"},
{"title": "First shop and the menu planning", "date": "Tuesday 23 February 2010", "text": "Today I did a menu plan for the coming week, based mainly on what I know is in the freezers and cupboards.Today: Lasagne for the gang and a shepherd's pie variation for meWed: Fish pie/fish and veg for meThursday: HM Chicken nuggets and wedges/Chicken curry and riceFriday: Pie and veg/Leftover curry for meSaturday: Toad in the Hole/Sausages with vegSunday: Roast ChickenMonday: Macaroni cheese/LeftoversYou can see from that that we are all basically eating the same thing with some slight modifications for me, to accommodate the dietary restrictions I have.  Puddings are occasional and usually crumbles or quick microwave sponge puds.  The EFG made Angel Delight again for a treat tonight, but that is that and there won't be any more for a while!Breakfast - we are not a cereal family:The EFG usually has toast, the FH has porridge or fruit, I usually have fruit or occasionally porridge, and the YFG is a challenge to get to eat much - it varies between toasted cheese sandwiches, eggy bread, bacon sandwiches (when there is any bacon), toast, and sometimes scrambled egg or a boiled egg.  I do sometimes make pancakes for everyone, too.Lunches - the packed lunches are basic - sandwich, HM cake or biscuit, fruit, and a drink. Sometimes they want a carrot, or some popcorn as an alternative or as an extra if they are feeling hungry!  At home, we eat soup, leftovers or baked potatoes usually.We were running out of fresh fruit and veg so I have had to go shopping tonight when we came out of gym.  I bought:2 Savoy cabbages @ 50p each2.4kg carrots for £1.502 large heads of broccoli for £1.50  (670g altogether)2 bags clementines for £31kg of parsnips for 70p (reduced)Bag of apples £1.54Mushrooms 79pRashers of back bacon £2Pkt Rocky bars £1Total spent £13.03 - total remaining £86.97"},
{"title": "Still going strong!", "date": "Monday 22 February 2010", "text": "We have come through the weekend without spending anything from the £100 budget so I am pleased.  I have spent both days watching a gymnastic training course for coaches in Peterborough, so my opportunities for spending were limited anyway!!There is a \"spend\" happening tonight but I'm not making it and it is not coming out of my £100.....yesterday the FH made Toad in the Hole whilst I was out, and although I specifically said not to use my wheat-free flour, that is exactly what he did use, and I was fuming when I found out, for two reasons - I had only half a bag left and wanted to make it last as long as I could AND it costs so much more than the normal flour I buy: compare Dove's Farm wheat free flour at £1.88 a kilo, to Sainsbury's or Tesco Value at 43p for 1.5kg and you see that it is horrendously expensive compared to the usual wheat flour.  SO I have asked him to replace the Dove's Farm flour for me.I got up at 5am to make the scones for the dance on Saturday, so I managed to complete on that promise.  I split and buttered them when I got home in the evening.  Putting a chicken in the slow cooker meant that the FH just had to do some veggies and we had a hot meal almost ready when the YFG and I got home at 5.30pm.  The dance was great, but the girls and I left at 9.30pm as we had another early start yesterday.  The FH and UJ stayed until about 11pm and came home with three raffle prizes between them - a basket of fruit, chocolates and some bath items.Sunday was fine until we got into town to pick up the people we were taking to Peterborough with us and it started to snow heavily - and continued all the way there, getting heavier and the roads seeming to be untreated, especially in Peterborough; I breathed a huge sigh of relief when we parked at the gym eventually!   The relief was all the more when we came out at 4pm and found all the snow melted away and bright sunshine everywhere.Today has been good so far as I have done some catching up on the housework and laundry, been to a church meeting this afternoon to the Worship Leaders course - the last meeting for that, so we were told we had passed and given a certificate!  The FH has now taken the EFG off to band practice, the YFG has her friend here and they are watching a DVD upstairs, so I am thinking of cooking the tea soon.  I just have an 8pm Education Foundation meeting tonight and that will be that.  Just got a little ironing to do now whilst I watch the news and then I'll start on the tea."},

The EFG and the FH have gone to Ely Cathedral to a SSAFA concert - the Royal Marines (Collingwood) band are giving a concert so they have gone to that.  Tickets were bought prior to the challenge, so that is OK!Tonight I am supposed to be making about 100 cheese scones for the dance we are holding for the church tomorrow, but I am also thinking about the fact I need to get up at about 5am in the morning and wondering whether my brain and body really need to go to bed NOW and maybe make the scones in the morning.  I need to leave the house at 7.30am so perhaps there is time to make them fresh in the morning IF I get all the ingredients ready and the trays laid out tonight."},

Heavy snow is forecast for tonight, so we will open the curtains with bated breath in the morning!!It was good overall although it had its ups and downs. The YFG wanted to go ice skating in Peterborough this week, so since I could combine the trip with a work-related pickup there, I took her today.  The biggest down of the day was that on arrival at Planet Ice, the car park was absolutely fit to burst (it HAD burst - all over the double yellows out front, into the neighbouring car parks, etc) and there was a very long queue snaking out the door.  We gave it a miss.  I did the work pickup and then we headed off to Hampton as she had some money she wanted to spend on a new purse. The EFG spent the afternoon at home, although she invited a friend round and they played on the Wii and watched a DVD.  I was glad to get home to the fire at 4.30pm.This evening's meal has been chicken curry and then a concoction made from slightly stale ginger cake, a banana and some banana-flavoured Angel Delight.  Another No Spend Day for me and the household budget, so I was pleased.This challenge is also going to teach us some patience: the girls are keen for me to pre-order the New Moon DVD in the Twilight series which will come out on March 22nd, but I am holding out until after the end of the challenge.  I had to pass over two books I would have loved to have bought in WHSmith today, so it is not all a breeze!"},
{"title": "First day - we managed it!", "date": "Wednesday 17 February 2010", "text": "A successful \"No Spend Day\" today, and no one has been hungry!I have been following a thread on www.moneysavingexpert.com in which a lady called weezl and her followers are trying to put together a subsistence meal plan for a month, spending only £100, for a family of four and eating a lot of vegetarian foods.  I tried their carrot cake recipe tonight for the FH and girls, and here is my version as I modified it a little:200g sugar300ml veg oil4 eggs, beaten320g grated carrot200g mixed dried fruitgrated zest and juice of one large orange350g SR flour1tsp bicarb2 tsp mixed spiceI zested and juiced the orange and then put the resulting zest and juice into a bowl with the dried fruit and left it to sit for about 10 minutes, before stirring it up really well.I turned the oven on to 180C, and prepared two Swiss roll tins, greased and lined with baking parchment.  One of my tins is only about 3/4 the size of a normal Swiss roll tin, so bear that in mind.Then I put all the ingredients into a bowl and mixed them well.  The resulting mixture was spread over the two tins, and baked for about 20-25 minutes.  It went a lovely golden brown and I stuck a knife in to check that it was cooked, but it sprang back when I touched it too.The FH managed to leave it to cool, although I could tell that the smell was really tempting him!!  They have all tried a piece, and the FH and EFG loved it as it was, but the YFG had to pick out all the fruit and then had another piece!  Maybe I will try a non-fruited version with a little more carrot sometime.It smells delicious, and has absolutely no need of any icing - it is light and well risen, too.  A success.  Thanks, Weezl and friends!Today's evening meal was jacket potatoes with beans (for me) and with beans and cheese for the girls.  The FH had been out to his lunch club and had lasagne, so he just had a cheese and lettuce sandwich."},
{"title": "Lent Challenge", "date": "Tuesday 16 February 2010", "text": "Tomorrow is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent, so I have decided to make myself and the family a challenge.  I have plenty of stores in the cupboards and we have £100 in an envelope.  That £100 will be our money for the next 6 and a half weeks until Easter Sunday on April 4th.  Whatever is left will be given to church or charity.  I will be ashamed if there is nothing left to give!To explain a little more, the £100 must cover food, toiletries, incidental expenses, etc but will not include fuel, bills, poultry and rabbit food (no chance!) and the FH's activities (art and lunch club - I couldn't do it with those included) and the EFG's band sub is excluded too - those things are non-negotiable and things that we cannot do without.  Living where we do, we can't cut back our diesel/petrol bill any more than we have, and the other things are just \"must-pay-for\" items - the FH's activities are his small extravagances and cost relatively little - and I'm not stopping those.  They come to about £5.50 a week and the band sub brings the total to £7, so if I included them in the challenge, too much of the money would go on these things alone.We CAN be more inventive with our menu plans, we can cut out convenience foods and snacks bought when we are out and about, we can carry water-bottles, we must not buy books and magazines, shoes and clothes.  The YFG will wait for a new leotard!This boils down to just over £14 a week over the time so we will have to keep a strict eye on what has been spent.  This will have to be spent mostly on fruit and vegetables, and replenishing items we run out of, and for which we are unable to find an inventive alternative!  I think we may lose some weight!!I'll be keeping a record on here of how we are doing.It's half-term here in the Fens, so we are enjoying a week away from the normal school routine.  Yesterday we didn't do anything in particular, apart from the girls having various people here to play and friends dropping in, but today we went to the cinema in Huntingdon to see a film called \"Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief\" which was refreshingly different.  The only major stars it had in it were Sean Bean and Pierce Brosnan, and they weren't huge parts, so the bulk of the film was the younger, to us, unknown cast.  It was refreshingly different, and slightly educational in that it involved lots of Greek gods and goddesses and associated mythical creatures - how many can I remember?  Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, to start with, then Hermes, Medusa and her snake-head, a many-headed beast called a Hydra, I think, a goddess of battle strategy and wisdom whose name escapes me but began with an A, and then there were the Lotus eaters.  It was a good film, and we enjoyed it.  As a pleasant surprise, some friends were there in the cinema when we arrived there, so we sat with them.Pancake Day today, so although I fell asleep, the FH has made pancakes for pudding after the dinner tonight - good on him and thanks!!"},
{"title": "Weekend catchup", "date": "Monday 15 February 2010", "text": "Friday was a washout - I came down with a head cold and just got up for about 45 minutes to make breakfasts and lunch boxes, and then I went back to bed and to sleep until I woke up again at 1.30pm.  I showered, ate some lunch, checked some emails and then had to head out to gymnastics.  Thanks to the sleep I had had, I coped OK with the evening at gym.Friday night, however, was a different matter: I got to sleep around midnight, and then was woken about an hour later by the FH pummeling me with 8 or 9 fierce punches to my upper back.  I sat up and swore very rudely, but he was dreaming!!  We had watched \"Silent Witness\" on tv in the evening, which had been a story based around the trials and tribulations of two rival gangs in London's inner city tower blocks.  Consequently, the FH had a dream about being attacked by one of these gangs and was attempting to punch his way out of a fight.  Unfortunately, I was the one who took the brunt of it - I have never been hit so hard in all my life.  Thank goodness that I usually sleep with my back to him - he could have punched my face/nose if I had been facing him.All that meant that I have been very sore over the weekend.  I was due to go out with the coaches and some of the parents from gym on Saturday night for a meal, but what with the cold and the pummeling, I gave that a miss.  By Sunday morning, I was doing a little better but it was still sore to sit for too long, so I went to the wedding at our church but had to pass on the meal afterwards - and I was glad I did as the FH and girls didn't get home until after 4pm and that would have been agony having to sit for that long.Yesterday evening, I nipped over to see my dad.  He looks well now, which is a relief, and I was pleased to see him looking that well.  He does have some bruises where the lines went into the back of his hands, but overall, he looks tired but OK.  With some rest, I think he's going to be fine.  The GP came out to see him on Friday and said that there is no trace of the chest infection left - hurray!"},
{"title": "Happenings here", "date": "Thursday 11 February 2010", "text": "Goodness me, I had a fright this morning when the Medical Assistance company called at 7.30am to say that their driver hadn't yet found Dad and MB at the airport - two hours after the plane landed!  I was on tenterhooks for ten minutes, wondering who to call, when he then rang back to say that the driver had them safely found and they were on their way home - whew, the relief!!  To have come all this way and then got lost in the airport would have been too much...Other news is that I spoke to the poultry man, Steph, last night and he has many more breeds this year than he had last time I visited him.  He has been improving his bloodlines and is hoping to produce some excellent birds this year.  He is also reporting good fertility already in some breeds, so I have my fingers crossed for my own hatchings from his eggs.  Last year I got most of the eggs we hatched from sellers on ebay, but that meant that a lot of the eggs had to come through the postal system, which isn't a great idea.  This year we have decided to purchase only from people from whom we can actually go and pick the eggs up, in the hope of greater success rates.  We are probably going to start with Barnevelder and Silver-laced Wyandotte bantams from Steph, and maybe he'll have some Gold-laced Orpington eggs later in the year - Coco was one of those, so I am hoping that I'll be able to raise some more of that beautiful breed this year."},

I am sure that they will be very relieved to get home after all this, as I know I will be tremendously glad to see them again and know that they are back here with us.  I know that they have been on the other side of the world, and it has felt so FAR!Goodness knows how they will feel about the weather - they are coming from balmy Caribbean heat back to snow and ice, so I am sure that they will feel quite a difference.  Here this morning, the sun is shining but there are large flakes of snow falling from the sky and there is a keen wind at times so it feels frrrrrrreeeeeeeezing!The time has come to start investigating getting some eggs in the incubators - we are going to phone a man in the Wisbech area from whom we bought some birds last year and ask if he will sell us some eggs.  I know last year he had silver-laced Wyandottes, Light sussex and Rhode Island Red as well as a couple of other breeds, so I am hoping he will have some eggs to spare soon.I forgot to say - we finally got the new Volvo last Friday.  The YFG was over the moon to see it at last and we had to go to gym in it Friday night and Saturday morning.  Friday she sat in the front, but Saturday she tried all the other seats out - the back and the two in the boot!  She has declared it lovely, and wants to go everywhere in it now, passing over my poor old Astra at every opportunity!"},

He sounds as if he is getting back to normal, and I was pleased to hear him sounding cheerful.Saturday was a busy day, with gym in the morning, shopping and then getting everything ready for the Songs of Praise service at church in the evening.  There was a bit to do for that, so the girls cooked a couple of frozen pizzas for tea before we went out.  The evening was a success with everyone enjoying themselves, but it would have been louder in the singing if more people had come.  We raised £95 to add to the £180 we raised at the coffee morning, so all in all, it was a good weekend for the  funds!This morning I left the YFG and the FH in bed and just took the EFG to church.  We had a really lovely service with a preacher we hadn't had before, and we were very pleased to meet her - and hope she'll come again!  This afternoon, the neighbour's little boy, A, has been here to play on the Wii with the YFG, bringing with him his Clone Wars helmet - so he scared me half to death with the voices which emerged from it.  I retreated to the kitchen and made a cake for tea and a traybake for the lunchboxes as well as cooking up two batches of mince - we had shepherds' pie tonight and the second batch is in the fridge ready to be made into spag bol for tomorrow night.This evening, my sister rang so I had a chat with her, did the school uniform ironing, put another load of washing through the machine and hung it on the airers by the fire, watched \"Wild at heart\" and now I'm heading for bed."},

He is in a single, en-suite room, with all mod cons, I hear.  The telephone reception is good and I have spoken with him and MB each day.  The doctors are treating him well, and he is hoping to be coming home in 2 or 3 more days.I have been in touch with the medical assistance company which the insurance company instructs, and they are dealing most efficiently with the claim, liaising with the hospital, the GP in this country and P&O too.  There is some question over just how much of the care and expenses that they are prepared to pay for  now as it seems that one of the conditions which is causing the problems was a pre-existing one.  Having asked Dad about it, he says that his doctor didn't tell him that it was a different condition or that it was anything to worry about.  That could be an expensive time for him, or us as it transpires now that his cards are in his wallet, in his trouser pocket, packed into a suitcase which P&O are delivering back to the UK ie it is still on the blinking boat and not available for use!!!I'll be having a day off from ringing them tomorrow as we are organising another Songs of Praise at church for tomorrow evening.  This weekend is the Chapel Anniversary, so we had a coffee morning today and raised £180 towards some damp-proofing work."},
{"title": "Morning news from the Oriana", "date": "Wednesday 3 February 2010", "text": "Dad and MB were going to be \"landed\" in Antigua this morning and taken to a Medical Centre, where Dad will see a cardiologist.  I have spoken with the Care Team at P&O, been assured of their assistance for Dad and MB, tracked down the insurance company who are going to be dealing with their case and repatriation and left my name and number with them, and been given the number of the Medical Centre, so I think that all possible lines of communication are open!I am expecting the Care Team to let me have an update this afternoon.The latest news on the patient last night was that he had been out of bed, the wires are all removed so he is free from drips and stuff like that, although he is still using a heart monitor most of the time.  Temperature and BP are normal, and he had had fish and chips for his lunch, probably a low-fat version, and had been watching TV.  The doctor on board seems to want him and MB to get off today in Antigua to go to the hospital there so that Dad can see a cardiologist.MB sounded a lot calmer last night about the whole idea of staying in Antigua as she has been reassured that P&O will arrange everything and they will not be left to make their own arrangements.  I am supposing that P&O must have plans in place for such eventualities so there must be people in the ports who help people in these situations.  Anyway, we will know today what is going to happen.  Apparently, if Dad insists on staying on board and coming home that way, he will have to sign a disclaimer to the effect that he undertakes this next part of the journey at his own risk, having had the dangers explained to him.Apart from the dramas at sea, life goes on here: gym last night for the YFG and I whilst the EFG and the FH went to the EFG's Options Evening at school to find out more about the choices available to her for her GCSEs.  Today she has orchestra after school, and the YFG has art club, so I have more time to do things before picking them up at 4.15 and 4.30pm.I had better go and get ready to take the YFG to school now - cold and frosty start here this morning, so the car will need defrosting!!"},
{"title": "Health on board ship", "date": "Monday 1 February 2010", "text": "The latest word from the ship tonight is that Dad's cough is resolved but he is still in the medical centre, in bed and wired up, because his heart rate is up and down like a yo-yo and the doctors are trying a different drug this afternoon (on board it is still afternoon as they are 4 hours behind us) to try to get that under control.  MB sounds worried still, as the powers that be onboard have asked for Dad's passport and are considering what to do with him; when they leave Antigua tomorrow, they are at sea until they reach Madeira and that will be five or six days' sailing to get there.  To cap it all, MB has now been confined to the cabin with diarrhoea!  I really feel for her - she must be so worried.  I think that the diarrhoea will be more likely down to stress than the norovirus but nevertheless, I should think that that is what they suspect she has got.  I am just hoping that they take good care of her as well.  We have arranged to speak again tomorrow, although she has said she will phone me earlier if there are any developments. Personally, I think that he is in better hands on the ship, heading for home and \"in hospital\" than he would be moved to a land-based hospital in Antigua, as he would then have to be certified fit to fly - and I know my Dad - and 8 hours on a plane would send his heart into palpitations for sure - he has always avoided flying if at all possible.  The furthest he has flown in recent memory (but that's more than 15 years ago!) was the hour from Cambridge airport to Jersey!"},
{"title": "And it was all going so well........", "date": "Sunday 31 January 2010", "text": "I've been absent again - sorry!  The week has been interesting, since we purchased the new car.  The YFG in particular is desperate to know what it looks like and when we are going to actually get it!  When we have been out and about with her in the car, she has been constantly asking, \"Is it like that one?\" whenever she sees anything that is either an estate or looks like it might be a Volvo.  It gets a bit tedious so I hope it won't be too long before we get our hands on it for real.  Unfortunately, the insurance certificate hasn't arrived yet, so I don't think that it will be tomorrow as we need that to get the tax.Friday night and Saturday saw the YFG and I at gym, then shopping Saturday afternoon.  I was so tired last night that I decided not to set the alarm early for church, so the FH and EFG went on our behalf.  They came home with a wedding invitation from our friends who are getting married in the church on the 14th February.  The wedding will take place in the church service that morning, which we knew about, but we have also been invited to the restaurant next door for a meal afterwards, which will be lovely.Today started with some bad news as the FH's cousin's wife phoned to say that the cousin, J, is in hospital in King's Lynn.  He has had diabetes for years, and has had part of one leg amputated a few years ago.  He is 85 and has gone downhill recently and now his heart is straining to keep up and his chest is badly congested with fluid. Yesterday the EFG and I managed to get all the chickens back into the proper runs so that they lay in the proper nestboxes and stop having a free run of the garden.  A few made a break for freedom this afternoon when a little girl came round to see them and inadvertently left a gate open, but luckily only about 8 got out; it still took the EFG and I nearly half an hour to round them up, but I got so filthy that I decided to stay out and get all the other outside jobs done too.  We cleaned out another two hutches of rabbits - 6 rabbits make a heap of poop - and found over two dozen eggs in the process; 15 laid in the bales of straw at the side of the rabbit hutches and about 11 or 12 were under a chicken house.  I have washed them all and tested them for freshness in water and they are all fine and usable - so many eggs all of a sudden - a baking day tomorrow is on the agenda and it couldn't have come at a better time as there is another Coffee Morning on Friday for the chapel so I'll get some buns in the freezer.At 3.30pm, my dad's travelling companion and friend, MB, phoned from the Caribbean - they are on the Oriana, and unfortunately Dad has been taken ill with a bad chest infection so he has been taken into the medical centre on the boat and is being treated with a drip and IV antibiotics.  MB said they have a lovely Norwegian doctor and all the equipment they need so he is in safe hands.  The other side of the coin is that they had mentioned putting him ashore into the hospital in Jamaica, and she really didn't want that - I can imagine her panic and distress at being abandoned in Jamaica, far from home and far from anyone that she knows.  She thinks that they will be fine as long as they are able to stay on the boat - and I hope that that is true.  Hopefully the antibiotics will clear the infection and he'll be fine to go back to his cabin and continue on the holiday.  They have nearly two weeks left before they get home on the 13th.  He is 80 and she is 70, so they opt for cruise holidays because they get to see the world from a floating hotel, and rarely do many of the excursions off the boat - when they do get off, they usually just have a little trip around the local area but they don't do lengthy bus trips or anything strenuous.  If anyone is minded to pray for them and the cousin, I'd be grateful.The week ahead is looking busy - the piano tuner is coming tomorrow and the FH has his art club, then after school there is band practice for the EFG; Tuesday has a church council meeting and then gym, Wednesday is the lunch club for the FH and an extra Governors' meeting at school about finance, Thursday will be work for me, and then Friday is the chapel Coffee Morning and gym.  Saturday we are holding another Songs of Praise for the chapel as it is the Anniversary weekend - must find the CDs of the hymns!!"},
{"title": "Surprise purchase", "date": "Wednesday 27 January 2010", "text": "I thought that today was going to be a good day for getting things done, and I did get a few things crossed off a long list this morning whilst the FH was out, but then he came home and things started to go a bit haywire.He got back at about 11 and told me about a secondhand Volvo he had seen on his travels this morning, so I mulled that over whilst he was out at lunch, and then we decided to go and have a look at it this afternoon.  The upshot of all of that was that I wrote quite a large cheque out, and we have a new car!!It is an L registered Volvo 850 estate, so it is slightly smaller than the 940 we have at the moment.  It is in very good condition, and there are lots of nice features like leather seats, which we are quite pleased with, electric windows all round, instead of just in the front, and there are also two small seats in the boot! It is a year younger than 940 and hasn't been worked quite so hard.  The dealer took it in part-exchange and they have done work on it since that owner had it, so they know it, and told us what work they have done on it recently.  They are going to give it an up-to-date MOT so we get 12 months' worth of that, and put 6 months road tax on it as well.The 940 will be moving on, either to a new owner who wants a banger, or to the scrapyard!  We have had it for about 6 and a half years and it cost us £1000 so it has cost less than £15 a month over its time with us for the actual car.  This new one has cost £1295, so I hope that we can keep it for at least as long, and we'll have another bargain.  If we are careful with it and keep up to date with the maintenance, we should have a good chance.I've sorted the insurance out to start on Monday 1st February, so the tax can be arranged to start then as well, and hopefully we'll be able to bring it home early next week."},

Tuesday saw me rushing about in the morning, doing the things that needed to be done at home, but then in the afternoon, I had the Worship Leaders' course at church at 1pm, then off to pick up the EFG from school and then go to her Parents' Evening at school, then to gym for the rest of the evening. I had begun to realise by 8pm that I was getting to the end of my energy for the day, but I hadn't realised how tired I was until I got up on Wednesday and just couldn't get going!!Anyway, today has been better and I have plodded instead of rushing!  We have been out this morning, had a long-overdue chat with my lovely neighbours, watched some TV, read a book, made a cake, walked the mile to school to pick up the YFG, who was pleasantly surprised that we were walking, and delighted that her friend T was walking too so we all chatted all the way home!  And the sun was out so that made the walk all the nicer.  The girls have both had friends round after school - the EFG and her friend took the friend's dog for a walk on the common land on the estate (it's a lovely little terrier, aobut 12 or 14 weeks old, I think) and the YFG and her friend played on the Wii until she had to go home for dinner and we sat down to eat ours.This evening I had my dad phoning me on his mobile from the cruise ship in the Caribbean, asking me to put some credit on his phone for him, but the phone cut out just as he was telling me his phone number!  I did 1471 but the number wasn't available - so I had to phone the cruiseship at £3 a minute, so my conversation was limited to \"What's the number?\" and \"Which network?\" Having got the information I needed, I got onto the web and did the deed for him. More eggs! Yippee!  Two more yesterday and three more today - the girls are beginning to get the hang of this but they are not always laying them in the nestboxes, yet... The FH and I had a while clearing out some stuff in the garage and found some old photo albumns - one with the very first photos of the EFG including the scan picture, and one with our wedding photos (taken by the EFG's godfather).  Gosh, I looked different then, way back in '96 - the EFG can't get over the size of my glasses - they are not quite as bad as Deirdre's on Coronation Street but they are definitely out of today's fashion!!"},
{"title": "Spending all you have  - and more!", "date": "Monday 18 January 2010", "text": "I have read a couple of posts today which have made me think, so I am sharing my thoughts!I don't spend all we have - I say \"I\" because I am the chief spender here: the FH spends very little, only £2.50 a week for his art club and £3.50 each Wednesday for his lunch club.  That is really it as far as his regular spending goes!  He never buys himself clothes and I bully him into getting new shoes now and again.....so all our money is generally under my control, and I look after the savings as well.  I spent a couple of hours investigating interest rates on Friday morning.I could spend it all every month, but I would be scared, and stupid, I think, to do so.  I firmly believe in living within our means, and saving some money each month.  We actually live some way below our means, which enables us to make the savings.  It also means that when we decide to splurge, as we do once or twice a year, we have the money to do it without worrying about using credit or going into an overdraft.  \"Splurging\" is what we call doing something we enjoy but which we don't do regularly - like going out for a meal together, or buying the Wii earlier this month.  Because we don't eat out often, the girls find that it is more of a treat and a special occasion when we do! The YFG and I watched \"Wife Swap USA\" early on Saturday morning whilst we were eating our breakfast: we were both amazed at the difference in the two wives' lives as one was a total control freak and the other was so laid back she was horizontal.  She didn't plan an hour in her kids' lives, let alone plan their college educations as the other wife was doing.  I think that we are somewhere in the middle - we are planning a little further ahead than the laid back wife but we are not controlling them and their futures. Part of that planning is teaching them financial responsibility and how the world of money works at our level - we are not merchant bankers or stockbrokers, but we have to have some understanding of banks, interest rates and borrowing to pass on the important points to them about avoiding unnecessary debt.  I want to be a decent example to my children and not to let them think that it is possible to lounge around all day at the state's expense (and I say that with no disrespect to the people who have been made redundant, as I am more concerned with some families in which there is a culture of benefits, where no one is working, no one has worked within recent memory and none of the family has any intention of looking for work!). I can't say what proportion of income people should save, but I can say that at least 10% would be a start, and some months I manage as much as 30% if I am working on lowering the stores, but everyone's circumstances are different.The other thing that has made me think this weekend is the concept of spending money when you have plenty.  Just because one has a fantastic income, perhaps, or great wealth, does that make it right to spend money like water?  I can see that there might be an argument in favour of spending as some would say that those who have money should spend it to help keep the rest of us in jobs, but I don't agree with spending willy-nilly.  If one has a little extra, I believe it should be used wisely - perhaps on a more energy efficient car or boiler for example, not on wild parties and expensive gas guzzling cars. If I won the lottery on Wednesday (I won't as I don't participate) I don't think I would buy a posh car although I would certainly get a new one as both of our cars are on their last legs and will need replacing this year or next.  I would look into moving house so that I could have a little more land for the chickens, and growing more veg and soft fruit.  I would invest in the childrens' educations, for certain, and I would give a chunk of the money away.  But I see no reason to stop buying Value tins of peaches, or scouring the shelves for the yellow-stickers on the reduced items - it is still a matter of getting the best value for money (although yes, I have heard the argument that if you have more money, you shouldn't buy the reduced goods as then people who genuinely have less money and therefore more need are deprived of them......).Other news - another baby born to a family on the street - a baby boy.  Must have been born last night or this morning, but don't have any more details yet.  And on the chicken front here, no more eggs yet!"},
{"title": "Whirlwind Sunday", "date": "Sunday 17 January 2010", "text": "Sundays are turning out great just lately.  I seem to steam through the day, getting tonnes done and yet not feeling at all stressed or rushed - I wish every day was like this!  Uncle J is here for the weekend - he came Saturday afternoon and will leave us again on Monday.We started off at church at 9.30.  I was leading the service today; we had fun playing some games and learning a couple of \"new\" hymns - they weren't new to me, but they seemed to be new to some of the congregation, but one lady said what beautiful words one of them had and how it was a really good choice, so I was relieved that they weren't cross that I had chosen it and they didn't know it.  The whole theme of the day was love - so that was a really uplifting and positive start to the day. After church, I was busy in the kitchen, preparing lunch - good old roast chicken with roast potatoes (they are much more crisp if they are put into COLD oil - try it!), carrots, cabbage and sprouts, stuffing and gravy.  I also baked a coffee and walnut sponge cake for tea, and made a chocolate and pear pudding for lunch. Lunch was ready at about 2pm, and after clearing away and loading the dishwasher, I headed out to clean out the henhouses.  Today has been the first fine day for ages and I had to take advantage of the weather!  About two hours later, the chicken houses were fresh and clean again, and the girls were keen to get moved back in, as by the time I had finished, it was beginning to get dark and they were wanting to head for bed!  However, I found some egg-citing (!!) discoveries this afternoon: three eggs - they are starting to lay again - hooray and hallelujah.One was under a perch, one was in a nest box (sensible girl) and one, unfortunately, was under a table in the verandah, and was broken. A shower was an absolute must after all that - then we sat down for a lovely cup of tea and a piece of cake.  It is scrummy and between the five of us, we have almost demolished it!This evening, I have cleaned the kitchen with the YFG, scrubbed the floor and washed most of the cabinet doors down.  She spent most of the afternoon clearing out the hallway - she took ALL my books off the shelves in there to dust them and the shelves.  Not sure she is feeling OK.  She certainly didn't get that from me - but hey, it looks great now she is done.  I have had instructions to sort the utility room out whilst she is at school tomorrow.  I want to do our bedroom too as there is a chronic shortage of storage (either that or too many clothes - which is more likely?) and it is a tip.All the ironing got done whilst I was watching \"Wild at Heart\" on ITV, and now the girls are tucked up in bed, and I am trying to catch up on here for five minutes.The EFG is still suffering with the cough, although it is getting better and she coughs less often."},
{"title": "Paper, paper and more paper", "date": "Wednesday 13 January 2010", "text": "I am feeling overwhelmed with organisational issues at the moment - just how to keep track of all this paperwork?!  I have come home from a school board meeting with a folder full, I will get more at the Worship Leaders' course tomorrow, and there are Risk Assessments to be written for gym, so there are several significant heaps of it......help!I am the first to admit that I am not a tidy person - whenever I get things tidy, they get untidy pretty quickly.  I tried Flylady, and couldn't hack the pace, and it didn't seem relevant to my life - she talks about keeping the entryways clear, I am more interested in keeping the verandah clear of chicken poop, so we clearly have very different priorities in life.  I do have filing cabinets, two of them, in the garage, probably full of junk I should clear out.  I don't like filing like that, though, much preferring ring binders so things are contained more securely - but I am acquiring a surfeit of ring binders now.  Maybe I am just keeping too much stuffffffffffffff!Had to go to buy more chicken food today, and some material for the EFG's school sewing project, no - sorry - her \"technology\" project - six weeks to DESIGN the thing, and two weeks to make it.  Something wrong there.  Students Need Home Economics classes so that they have the skills to live in the big wide world, because too many parents these days are either a) too busy to teach their children or b) don't know themselves.  Rhonda Jean's blog should be on the curriculum to teach them about budgeting, gardening, baking, etc because that would make a whole lot more sense than spending eight weeks designing a pizza box - and the FH used to be a technology teacher.  This was back in the day, though - students made furniture and useful items, and learned the beginnings of a trade with him, not how to make jitterbugs (don't ask!)."},
{"title": "Poop patrol", "date": "Sunday 10 January 2010", "text": "After sorting out the chickens with their hot mash this morning, I decided that the verandah area really had to be tackled.  This weather has meant that the chooks have enjoyed coming out of their run and making a temporary daytime base under the verandah - and who can blame them?  They get whatever sun there is, they are protected from wind, rain and snow, and then can peep in at us!  Unfortunately, it means that the garden furniture has been rather liberally covered in their poop, as well as the top of the freezers (not so bad) and the stone slabs on the floor are quite sticky too.So today, I started with the furniture - the covers are washable, so I was out there with a bucket of hot, soapy water and a scrubbing brush to clean them.  Luckily the weather today turned milder so it was OK to be out there for the best part of an hour.  The wind has picked up this afternoon and is much colder so I am glad I tackled the job this morning.  Once I had cleaned all the chairs, I put them in the garage for storage and protection until the sitting-out weather is here again (I am SO looking forward to spring this year!!).The freezer tops will have to be scrubbed as well but I had done enough this morning and really needed to come in to warm myself up so that can go on tomorrow's list.  The slabs will need scrubbing with hot water and a stiff brush but that chore will have to wait until the weather improves enough for the chooks to be shut up in the runs again.  The FH has thoughts of enclosing the verandah, which seems like a good plan to me but I have to wait for him to have the energy and the weather to be suitable.......might have to wait a while.The YFG and I have been to town this afternoon to try to get her some shoes but we failed again and will have to make the trip to the specialist shop in Downham Market.  We also took four bags of rubbish to the tip, and bought more cough medicine for the EFG.  She will be going to school tomorrow to see how she gets on, but if she is sent out of too many lessons because of her cough, she'll be back at home.  I know that it will be affecting her attendance rate, but she can't help being ill!!  Apparently, teachers send children out of lessons if they are coughing too much as they are causing a disruption!  If they need to be sent out more than a couple of times, they are they sent to the medical room, and from there, home.  Let's hope she makes it through the day as she is beginning to have some concerns about what she might be missing.We didn't make it to church this morning, which was a bit of a problem.  I am doing a Worship Leaders' course, and our homework was to observe the service this morning with a bit of a critical eye, and to make some notes to share next week.  That's me in trouble already!  What with the coughing, me having a cold and a sore throat, we didn't sleep well last night and then I slept right through the alarms this morning, so we were getting up about 20 minutes after the service started.  Whoops.Welcome to my latest follower - can't believe that there are six of you now - do send me a comment some time and tell me where you are from!"},
{"title": "Snow days are still here", "date": "Friday 8 January 2010", "text": "The snow is piling up in the garden and the chickens are really not too sure about it all - they are happy that they are getting hot mash each morning, but then they are taking refuge under the verandah for much of the rest of the day, basking in what sun there is, and pooping on my freezer, which is a definite downside.  The bunnies are OK - the hutches get covered up in the late afternoons so that the bunnies can preserve whatever body heat they have got in there! We have only been out of the village on necessary journeys since Christmas - taking books back to the depot on Monday this week, we had a lucky find of a load of pallets in their yard so we came back with a trailer load of those, which the FH has been cutting up and adding to his stockpile of wood.  He cuts the pallets and then leaves the bits for a couple of days in the workshop, then he or I spend half an hour picking the bits all up and storing them in feed bags ready to be brought up under the verandah for ease of lifting them in to the house as required: we are burning three or four bags' worth each day if I light the fire in the morning.  The EFG has not yet returned to school as she has been suffering with her cough, so we have been lighting the fire for warmth."},
{"title": "Spring cleaning", "date": "Sunday 3 January 2010", "text": "I had a room in the house which was full of \"stuff\" which was generally clogging up the room.  On the house plans, the room is the dining room, but we used it as that for only a year or two.  The dining table is now at one end of the large sitting room, where we can take advantage of the wood burner whilst we sit at the table, eating or using the laptop or doing whatever it is that we are sitting at the table for, even if it is only chatting.  So that room became a bit of a dumping ground - for the computer desk, the exercise bike and treadmill, the piano, the sewing bits and pieces, and lots and lots of books!I have spent the past three days sorting this room out as a project in between the other routines of daily life and the celebrations for the New Year.  I have released three bin bags full of rubbish, lots of books to charity shops and friends, and I have rehung some nicer curtains, and put pot plants on the windowsill again - the room looks civilised again, thank goodness.  I can get to the computer without stepping over junk, the piano has been polished and is playable, and the treadmill is usable again!!  Can't promise that will make much difference to the size of my backside at the moment, but it can be used, which is an improvement - just have to get the FH to use it as well since it was him for whom it was originally bought.  One mile a day would be an achievement for him.....Now that the sitting room is lovely after its redecoration, and this room is looking better, I have to hit the hall and move all the clutter dwelling under the stairs.The weather has dampened the New Year celebrations a little as people haven't wanted to come out in the snow and ice that has come back here.  We had a quiet evening and watched a DVD together before we had champagne with orange juice at midnight and enjoyed the spectacle of the London Eye's fireworks display at the sound of the bells.  We even switched over to BBC Scotland on the red button to watch Hogmanay Live for a few minutes - the sound of a pair of chaps playing the fiddle and the accordion brought it all back.  And we recognised the presenter from BBC Scotland but couldn't think of her name - now I think that it is Jackie something.  Glad to see that she is still around - we'll have been back in England 10 years come August, so a lot has changed!  Can still remember them saying the Gaelic greeting when they started the five minute Gaelic news broadcast - have no idea how to spell it but is sounds to me like \"Fisken Mar!\"The EFG's cough goes on and on - she is better in herself in that she has more energy, but the cough is still troubling her.  Hoping that she will be fit enough for school on Tuesday.Yesterday the girls and I went on a little shopping trip to Ely - they were looking forward to spending a little of their Christmas money.  We checked out some of the shops and there wasn't much they liked until we hit WHSmith, when there were some things that the YFG wanted to buy and a couple of books I fancied as well as one I had promised the EFG for Christmas but not been able to find.  We headed for the queue at the tills after about 20 minutes mooching around the shop, and then all the lights went out!  Almost everyone in the shop sighed - with some sadness - as we all knew that it meant that we wouldn't be able to complete our purchases since the tills weren't working.  Bring back pencil and paper and a money tin the old-fashioned way!  The whole street was out, and then some came back but not all - and none of the shops we wanted to go into.  So we and most of the population of Ely, it seemed, headed to Tesco, where we got some bargains in their post-Christmas sale - slippers for the FH, a pair of half-price PJs for the EFG (yes, she has already had some, but she was very short of PJs!) and some fruit.Today has been busy - church, pottering, lunch, Grandad coming to visit this afternoon, more pottering, supper, TV, tidying and hoovering, and a bit more TV.  A good, relaxing, happy day."},
{"title": "More sadness today", "date": "Tuesday 29 December 2009", "text": "I went outside this morning to let the chickens out and to feed them - I made them some hot mash, let them out and they were all in seventh heaven, strutting around the garden, moving from one of the feeders to the others and looking to see which had more food!  Then I came into the house to get a bowl to put the rabbit food in, fetched that and went to feed the rabbits, and there was Coco, dead on the gravel drive.  She had been eating along with the others, typically scurrying around as she did - she hated to not be in the thick of the action, she was last to bed every night and the first out the of the door in the morning.  When I picked her up, she had food in her crop and was obviously still warm, but very dead.  It is a mystery to me how she died, in the four or five minutes that my back was turned.  I cried.Although the picture you will find at the link shows her as a small chick, she had grown into a beautiful Gold-laced Orpington.  Her plumage was striking and she was a very inquisitive hen.  We'll miss her - she used to make such a lot of noise that we nicknamed her \"Cheepy\" as she was always cheeping for food when she was little."},
{"title": "Departures today", "date": "Monday 28 December 2009", "text": "The first departure happened sometime overnight and was only discovered first thing this moring: one of the Buff Orpingtons died in the night.  She was found, very cold and looking rather pecked, in the house this morning.  Another Buff was also in a miserable state but alive.  It is looking rather like they were being bullied, so we have removed the other one from the run.  She spent the day in the greenhouse in the sun, and then tonight I have put her in a small pen in the workshop under a heat lamp to keep her warm.  She ate voraciously when we offered her corn and warm mash today, so I think that part of the bullying had involved keeping them out of the food.  I hope she makes it through the night, and we'll have to see what we think over the next couple of days as to whether we re-introduce her to the flock.The second departure wasn't until 4pm when Uncle J left for home, taking his Christmas cake along with him.  He had plans to go bellringing tonight and then has work tomorrow so he had to go.  We were sorry as he is good fun to have around, but he will be back on New Year's Day. The YFG and I popped into town today to Sainsbury's for clementines, carrots, and greens.  That was what was on the list, but we also got a lovely joint of beef for NY and a new electric kettle, so we spent a little more than we bargained for, but it was OK.  We were only gone just an hour, so that was a rather rapid shopping trip, but it just proves that it can be done when we are focussed!  The town was quiet at 3.30pm with the shoppers wending their way home, but the lady on the till said that it had been busy at times.The washing machine is on the go and I have kept the fire stoked up to help to get it dry overnight.  The EFG is still unwell, so she had a shower and put on (my) new PJs today, and I changed her bed again to freshen it for her.  She has been downstairs for some time today but not too long.  The cough goes on.  She woke at 7.30 this morning and I went in to sort out her pillows and duvet for her, and re-administer the cough meds, and then we all went back to sleep until 9am.  She has not had many decent nights' sleep this holiday, so I will not be surprised if she sleeps for a day or two when this is over.Tomorrow - that'll be Tuesday - I lose track of time so easily when we have these high days and holidays - not sure what we'll get up to but we haven't had time to do the Christmas puzzle yet, so that will be on the agenda this week."},

Enough is enough! Christmas Day was spent very quietly here, just the four of us.  We all went to church first thing, and it was a lovely service, led by a husband and wife team, and there was a splendid feast on which to munch if we got peckish during the service!  Afterwards, we came home and the girls enjoyed looking at their gifts and sifting through the layers of paper - they were both pleased with their things, and the FH and I were lucky enough to receive some beautiful things too - I got some new PJs, earrings, chocolates, a poetry-set-to-music CD, and some novels.  The FH also got chocolate (Toblerone), two new fleece sweaters, some socks, lots of art equipment for his art class, and a military band CD from his cousin. We popped the turkey into the oven and relaxed whilst it cooked, then enjoyed it with all the trimmings at about 2pm.  The FH was well and truly stuffed by then and passed on the pudding, and actually didn't eat anything else all day.  The rest of us just had a sandwich during the evening as we were all pretty full too.The EFG has been suffering terribly with a cough, and although she managed to get through the big day, she spent most of Boxing Day in bed, just getting up and having a bath at about 4pm when the FH's cousin, cousin's wife and son came to tea.  She came downstairs after her bath and sat on the sofa but apart from coughing, she hardly made a murmur all day, and ate little. The YFG has spent some hours playing with the little boy (5) next door, and his new Wii.  He needed a friend to play on it with him as Mum and Grandma were getting a bit worn out!  She has worn herself out cycling, Mario Karting and playing tennis with him too.  She has enjoyed it tremendously, and the FH was there today and came home saying, \"We've got to get one of those!\" so the YFG was overjoyed!  She spent quite some time on the internet this afternoon researching all the best prices for me, and I have ordered it with all the extras.  Luckily, I had about £90 in Tesco clubcard vouchers, so they have been spent on it.  The website promises that it will be delivered Wednesday, and that is also when I have an Asda delivery due so we will definitely be staying home that day.Today we have been back to church for the usual Sunday service, which I led.  The main theme was Holy habits, which was a very thought-provoking idea, and connected well with the time of year and making resolutions to try to keep for 2010. My uncle joined me and the YFG for church, and the FH stayed at home to look after the EFG.  We had a cold lunch of salmon sandwiches and freshly made cheese scones, and then relaxed for the afternoon before I cooked a chicken dinner for 7pm.  The EFG has spend most of the day in bed in her new PJs or on the sofa.  Uncle J is staying for the night, but he will have to go home tomorrow as he has to go to work on Tuesday - his last three days of work as he will retire completely on Thursday.  He only works three days a week part-time, but at 70, the time has come to rush around less and get a few lie-ins! With bell-ringing, gardening and looking after the house, he has plenty to do without going to work and he feels that he should be relaxing a little more at his age.  I totally agree."},

I'll make some of those another day....Today the YFG has enjoyed a Christmas get-together over lunchtime at her friend S's house in the town, so the EFG and I did some last minute errands in the town - some of the older neighbours needed sacks of corn for their chickens/ducks, so we picked those up from the feed shop, there was money to bank and a few items needed from the grocery department too.  I'm through with shopping for 2009, I truly hope!  I have booked a delivery for next Wednesday, but I may cancel it as I think we have enough food in stock BUT I might let it come and then I can have January as a store-cupboard month like I did this year - saved loads of money!  Last January was when I saved the bulk of the money we needed to install the wood-burner, and now we are Really reaping the benefits of that effort - the feeling of walking into the sitting room when it is lovely, warm and cosy is beyond compare!Merry Christmas!!"},

The car we use to tow the trailer doesn't seem to be in very good form this morning, either, so the FH has had to use the other one to pootle off down to the doctor's - he has been coughing up phlegm all night, which means antibiotics are on the menu for him for a few days.Still, there is plenty to do here, so staying in is no problem!"},

Tonight, more snow has fallen for about 2 hours, and there is more forecast overnight - I'm kind of dreading waking up in the morning to yet more snow - this seems to be hanging around just a bit too long now; snow is one of those things which is great when it first happens as it is a novelty, but now that it has been here five days, the novelty has worn off and it is becoming just plain bothersome.I went to the Post office in the village this morning to send a couple of parcels, and unwittingly locked the FH out!  He was on his way home from the art club just as I was going out, and I presumed that he had taken the full bunch of keys: he hadn't!  Just taking the car key is not terribly helpful, but he went next door to the neighbour, who kept him sustained with tea and mince pies until I returned about 20 minutes later.  We joined them for tea and then came home for lunch.After lunch, we all went to town.  There was a Long List for Tesco and there were things needed from the town as well, so the FH and YFG hit Tesco and the EFG and I went to town.  We also picked up a floor lamp from Focus which we had ordered last week, but which is going to have to go back as it just refuses to go together - some of the screws don't fit and the FH got very frustrated trying to put it together this evening.  And a bulb was broken.We are supposed to be going to Peterborough to take a load of books back to the unit, but although they are all loaded into the trailer, it will not be safe if the weather continues in this vein as there will just be too much weight on the brakes to be safe.  The plan was to drop the books off and then go to my uncle's house to pick up a trailer load of logs but that may have to wait.I emailed this fantastic calendar to my local printer and he did some copies nicely bound for me to give to a couple of my friends as a little Christmas gift.  It is from www.moneysavingexpert.com and is really very helpful with no end of hints for saving cash, arranged for the appropriate months in which to do them.  I hope the friends who I have decided to give them to like the ideas! Have a look and maybe you'd like to print one off for yourself.  I'm keeping one for me, and I'm going to put all my important financial dates on it like the house insurance and car tax renewal dates, as well as the MOT dates - I'm always paranoid about forgetting them!Stay safe in this challenging weather - and keep warm!"},

The YFG is getting over her stomach bug but the EFG seems to be coming down with a cold as she is really suffering tonight with a sore throat and bunged up nose giving her a headache.  I think that perhaps we may not all make it to church tomorrow morning. The cat spent another night in the utility room last night, but if she tried opening the door again, she would have been thwarted by the sack of potatoes I put up against it!  She has been in since about 6pm and is curled up tight on one of the FH's fleecy sweaters (it's an old, manky one!) on a chair.The tree is up, at last, now that the curtains are up again in the lounge after the decorating.  We took all of half an hour to get it all up - I just need to buy some tinsel when we go out again.  I have started a shopping list as I reckon that the next time we do go to town will be the last time this year so I want to get all the bits and bobs we are running out of, as well as the vital supplies for Christmas like cranberry sauce!  I must go to the Post Office on Monday with some parcels even if we don't go to town."},
{"title": "No Spend Days are here again!", "date": "Friday 18 December 2009", "text": "Yes, there are several inches of snow on the ground, so I am staying home and not spending!!  Therefore snow is good for the bank balance!!The YFG has been unwell since Wednesday evening, so I couldn't go anywhere although I did send the FH on a mission to Focus and then Tesco.  We have had the sitting room painted and the FH unfortunately broke some of the curtain rail fixings when he took them down, so I wanted him to get replacements so that I could get the curtains back up again, but no joy - they don't keep that make.  Also made the mistake of asking him to nip in to Tesco as it is right next door to get some bread and clementines.  £35 later, he came home with bread, meat, clementines, a cheesy french stick, milk, three boxes of cereal (THREE!!) etc....I should have known better.I'll be back later to update the week's happenings, but I have to go back outside.  I fed the chickens and came in to thaw out, but now that I am, I have to go and thaw their water out so they can wash their breakfast down.  Some of the chickens are experiencing snow for the first time and they are hilarious - prancing round and pecking at it.  We let the cat stay in the utility room last night for the first time, but she was investigating the rest of the house at 3am and meowing rather loudly so I let her out.  She must be one of those cats which can open doors as the utility room door was firmly closed last thing."},
{"title": "Shop till you drop!", "date": "Thursday 10 December 2009", "text": "Well, my little expedition to Lidl turned into a major shopping trip.  I started in Lidl and did find some lovely art sets for the FH, and some for the girls too.  Then I went into the town and hit Superdrug for little girly bits and pieces for their stockings, as well as some regular shopping. I also had a look in the \"pound\" shop for some battery-operated tree lights for the Christmas tree at church - the only place we can put the tree is not convenient for plugging lights in properly, but a tree without lights looks a little bare, so I was pleased to find a small set for £4.99 which I hope will do the job.  They also had masking tape which I will need when we do the decorating. I had a quick look in Mackays (now called M&Co) and got something for the EFG.  I nipped into Sainsbury's and then went back out of town to Focus for paint charts, and to Tesco for the mens' socks I needed.  Needless to say, I picked up a few groceries in Tesco as well!When I got home, the whole lot had to be stashed away!  Hiding stuff from the girls is so hard at this time of year, but actually, sometimes hiding items in plain sight works well - they just don't see things right under their noses... I brought home the YFG for her lunch today as she has had a traumatic couple of days at school what with one thing and another; she didn't really want to go back at 1pm.  She ate very little of her packed lunch yesterday so I was pleased to see her wolf down a tuna and sweetcorn sandwich.  We have paid for her to have a school dinner tomorrow, so hopefully a change of direction will help - and perhaps I need to up the ante and give her more interesting lunches.Tonight the FH has gone out to a village history society meeting - a speaker is coming to talk about Oliver Cromwell as this is definitely Cromwell Country around this area!  He is going to discuss the opinions people hold on Cromwell as to whether he was a villain or a hero......the jusy is still out on that as far as I am concerned as I really don't know enough about him to make a decision.  My first knowledge of him came in a book my grandmother loved called \"The Children of the New Forest\" about a family during the Civil War who took to the forest to live in hiding.  I must have a look and see if it is still available these days as it was a good read."},
{"title": "One day at a time", "date": "Wednesday 9 December 2009", "text": "we are making it through the week!The Lakeland parcel has arrived, my hair has been coloured (not the colour the packet indicated that it would end up, but it has been coloured nevertheless - one daughter likes it, the other is not so keen!) and another load of pallets is now strewn about the garden.  The hairdresser, my friend B, brought her Christmas cake, the first one she has ever made, and I showed her how to marzipan it, but we ran out of time for me to do mine, so I will have to get mine done asap as she is coming back early next week to do the icing.  She is thrilled with it, so I just hope it tastes as good as it looks!! B was also an angel and helped my neighbour M whose hair had been butchered at a local salon on Saturday morning.  She was almost in tears over in on Saturday afternoon but B has sorted it out rather well and M is well pleased with the result; she finds hairdressers traumatic at the best of times, so to have it all go wrong like that was even worse - and to be charged £18 for the privilege was rubbing salt into the wound.Plans are underway for the party on Sunday and it looks to be coming together nicely.  I haven't offered to bake anything this time, so that is one less thing to do.  The HC's wife is doing some of the food shopping tomorrow and then I will get the bread for the sandwiches on Saturday afternoon, so it is fresher.  We are looking at about 80 children at the party, so I think it will be fun!!Tomorrow the FH is out doing deliveries for me, and I shall be doing some housework, and ironing.  I may watch a DVD whilst doing the ironing, and there may even be a spot of knitting - I am feeling much calmer than I was at the start of the week, when I just felt like there was too much to cope with.  I may have a quick trip to Lidl tomorrow as well, if I can fit it in, as their promotional items for sale this week are art/craft based things, and I want to get a couple of things for the FH's stocking to restock (pardon) his art supplies as he is enjoying his art classes so much."},
{"title": "\"What am I doing?\" she wails!", "date": "Monday 7 December 2009", "text": "I feel a bit overwhelmed at the moment! We have had a good weekend, and all the events went to plan - the coffee morning on Friday raised £220, then the choir came on Saturday evening and sang most beautifully, adding another £100 to the fundraising total, and Sunday.....well, Sunday happened....church, lunch, Dad coming over and then me popping round to D's house to lend her the sewing machine, but ending up playing charades with the family.  I managed to watch the beginning of Hugh F-W's Christmas programme, but fell asleep sometime after he made the venison joints, and never saw the final feast, unfortunately!I have agreed to do too much, as usual; there's the Christmas Party at gymnastics - next Sunday evening, the HC is going to redecorate the lounge before Christmas for me, I have almost all the Christmas presents to choose, buy and wrap, I have to prepare a Service for church for the 27th, hymns to remember how to play so need to practise,  clean the house as it is a tip and I am harbouring FAR too many spiders - webs aplenty here! Meal planning - what's that?  Ironing - yes, there's that to do, the washing machine is spinning so that needs rebooting asap, the chickens - oh, the poor chickens - too much mud - sorry, I am becoming a bit Virginia Woolf-ish in this rambling!   My friend B's mum came to the coffee morning on Friday to help B with her stall, and then shocked everyone by having a mini-stroke that night and being hospitalised till yesterday afternoon.  Poor B hasn't had much sleep, but she is coming round on Wednesday morning to marzipan our Christmas cakes (must get some apricot jam!) and do my hair for me.  She may need chocolate brownies to keep her going.... And to cap all my hassles, Lakeland has lost the parcel they were sending me!  They promised to re-dispatch so it will be delivered tomorrow but this second parcel hasn't got the cake stand in that I ordered as they are now out of stock, but if the first parcel should happen to turn up at any point, I am to open it and remove the cake stand from that one, and then send the rest back......My week is looking like this -Monday 1.30 - Governor visit to school/FH to art groupTuesday - stay in for parcel, FH and friend to fetch more pallets, then 3pm YFG and I to gymWednesday - hair/marzipan/chatting with B in the morning; FH out to lunchThursday - FH out with deliveries/forecast to be dry day so chickens need attentionFriday - gym at 3pm with YFGSaturday - gym from 9.30 to 1pm; promised girls trip to Ely to shops, then baking for partySunday - church at 9.30 then REST I hope until 4pm setting up for party, 6pm - 9pm party.Could we just stop the world for a couple of days so that I could catch up with everyone else??"},
{"title": "I can't believe it - I'm fashionable!", "date": "Thursday 3 December 2009", "text": "The EFG took (with my permission) a long scarf, a bit like a pashmina, from my wardrobe earlier in the year, and likes to wear it around her neck all the time.  She has the deep lilac one, and there is also a navy one in there somewhere, which she now has her eye on!  Anyway, the point being that she wears it to school now that the weather has turned so cold, and it seems that she is following the latest trend - these scarves are worn by all the \"in\" crowd.  One of them asked her today where she got hers from, so she answered, \"Mum's wardrobe,\" to which the girl said, \"Ooh, is that in Cambridge?\" thinking it was a shop.  The EFG had to explain that no, it was the big cupboard in the corner of Mum's bedroom!?!  The EFG added as she recounted this to me tonight that the girl IS blonde...(we're not - and no disrespect intended to bright blondes - it was just the way she said it!)"},
{"title": "Countdown to Christmas with NORAD", "date": "Wednesday 2 December 2009", "text": "I have added a link to the NORAD site at the bottom of the blog roll on the left of the page - we love to watch this on Christmas Eve to see where Santa is delivering all those parcels; he certainly moves fast!  At the moment, the site is showing a very handy countdown to Christmas, although I do believe that it is probably set to US time, rather than GMT, so it is not even as long as that to Christmas.....Again, I have been absent and I can only apologise - I just need about 28 hours in a day at the moment.  This wood burner in the lounge is fabulous, but it means hoovering in there every day instead of a couple of times a week, and then there's the heap of logs to keep replenished.  I do love it, though, and the warmth which it kicks out into the room is just toasty!Sunday afternoon was the village's Christmas bazaar event - lots of stalls, school choir, village band, Father Christmas, refreshments (where you would have found me, making tea for everyone!) and it was a great afternoon.  It seemed like the whole village turned out for it, so I am sure they must have made pots of money for the cause - we took £100 on the refreshments for them, so it was good. This Friday we have a coffee morning at church, and we are having a few stalls there too, as well as the usual raffle and cakes......and the FH is also busy helping me in the book business this week.  This morning, we have had to do some chicken-work in the garden.  The mud in the chicken runs is several inches deep, foul-smelling and trecherous to walk on, and the poor chooks hate having wet feet.  There is no way of draining it at all, so we have had to come up with a plan B: we have used some of the pallets he fetched last week to make a shelter along one side of the run, with floors, so that there is somewhere for the chickens to be during the day - it is covered, there is a perch for them to roost, and lots of straw for them to peck around in.  We both got absolutely filthy making it, but I am pleased that we have made something like a small improvement for them - let's hope the chooks like it.The FH put the new chicken house together yesterday - it went together quite well although there were a couple of little snags with the woodwork.  They were nothing that he couldn't fix, but I wouldn't have had a clue on my own.  Anyway, it is smart, and we are pleased with it overall, so I think that the Partridge/Black/Gold-laced Orpington crew might find themselves rehomed into it shortly as they are getting a bit big for their current accommodation.Now, what to have for supper tonight?  I should have made a longer plan, but I didn't.  Add that to the \"to-do\" list!"},
{"title": "Happy anniversary", "date": "Friday 27 November 2009", "text": "Today is our 13th wedding anniversary!  We've come a long way in those years, been through a lot and had a lot of ups and downs with health issues and financial struggles, but we still love one another. This morning I had to go to school to meet with the Chair of the Governors, which took most of the morning up.  By the time I got home, there was just time to have a cup of tea and then I wanted to make a start on all the baking.  I got 5 dozen mince pies made, although I probably still need to make another 10 dozen, but I'll do some more tomorrow.  After picking the YFG up from school at 3pm, we went off to gym - we got home at 9pm to a lovely roast lamb dinner.  It was gorgeous!"},
{"title": "Thanks be to whoever invented online shopping!", "date": "Wednesday 25 November 2009", "text": "My new chicken house - well, what it will look like when we have put it together!I have just spent an hour and a lot of money, and done some serious shopping online, all from the comfort of my chair here, with the aid of the poor old debit card.Lakeland, Tesco, the Cartridge People, Amazon, the Book People and something called Surfdome have all benefitted from my custom this evening, and it is such a relief to be able to say that I have done some Christmas shopping at last!  I did get the EFG's CD that she had on her list in Tesco this afternoon, and picked up 200 bonus clubcard points in to the bargain, but apart from that, the cupboard was looking pretty bare.  The poor postie will have a heavy bag for a couple of days, though!!And eBay - I bought the new chicken house on Monday night whilst the FH had taken the EFG to band.  I only went onto the site to see if people were still selling hatching eggs as I am hoping to get the incubators cranked up in February to get some earlier hatchings in 2010.  There are a few eggs for sale now, but I was just browsing and then I saw this gorgeous range of chicken houses being auctioned and only making silly money for what they were.  So I got one (that one, up there!) for just £62 plus the p&p - and it arrived this morning.  Now we just have to put it together!  It was necessary as the floor has all but fallen out of the oldest house we have and the FH's health has hampered him from doing the necessary repairs.  That old house has been in use for over 8 years, and could do with a revamp anyway, so we'll probably put it aside for 6 months and let it dry out, then recoat it with Cuprinol, put in a new floor and then it'll be ready as a house for new chicks in the spring.One of our neighbours came striding towards the house this morning, definitely a woman on a mission!  I was apprehensive as she came to the door, but she had a broad smile on her face, so I was able to relax and welcome her in. She had come to offer us free firewood - we just have to fetch it from the town.  Her daughter works for a company which has daily deliveries on pallets, and the pallets are stacking up in the yard so she needed to get rid of them. The FH went over there this afternoon with the lady, met her daughter and found out how it all works with regards getting access to the pallets, and brought a trailer load home.  She'd like him to fetch several loads to make a dent in the heap, and then fetch some each week!  Fires will have to burn here night and day to keep up with that kind of supply, so we have a friend who also has a fire and will be speaking to him about helping us out...Those are the kinds of friends and neighbours who really bless us.November is always a very full month - so much to get done in the preparations for Christmas as well as the autumn clearing up in the garden.  So I am sorry that I am not here much this month.  I'll get back more regularly soon!Last Saturday we had a fantastic evening at church - we were invited to a 60th birthday \"do\" and it was wonderful.  Instead of a party, it was a band concert - the birthday boy wanted to raise some money for the chapel so he put together his old band and had a blast!  There was a chap on saxophone (he had three different sized ones), a drummer who also sang, a guitarist who sang, and the organiser who sang and played keyboard.  There was also Ernie - who just sang, but boy, how he sang!  They did a mixture of music - country songs like \"Crystal Chandeliers\", ballads like \"If tomorrow never comes\" and inspirational music such as \"You raise me up\" and then there were some fab sing-a-long medleys.  They played for two hours - and we could have listened longer!  There was also a raffle, and then refreshments and cake.  We were delighted to hear the next morning that the evening had raised £600 for the chapel funds - an amazing blessing! The wet weather has caused us some inconveniences here - my poor chooks are a bit muddy, and I am having to dry the washing round the fire, but it is nothing to the devastation in the Lake District which the people of Workington and Cockermouth have suffered so our thoughts are with them.  I have never suffered that kind of flooding so I have no idea how they are coping with it all, but I know I never want to live in a place where that might happen.  We are incredibly lucky that the Fens are so well drained!  Flood management is a big thing here and there are areas like Welney Washes which do flood each year in the winter, but the water is contained within huge banks.The woodburner is in full service now - a roofer came and put the extra section on the top of it, and braced it very firmly to the roof, so we are enjoying cosy evenings in the lounge with it on.  It gives out a good heat and gets the washing dry, although I am careful to open a window a crack to let the moist air out as I don't want mouldy spots anywhere!  Two neighbours on the estate have also said that they want to get one as well so we have obviously started a trend, although our immediate neighbour is in opposition to the trend and started ranting on about it to my friend D in the doctor's last week and poor D had to tell the woman to be quiet!I missed the occasion on Sunday which was \"Stir Up Sunday\" when I should have made the Christmas pudding.  I'll be honest - I don't usually actually make one!!  My sister has been known to make some and let our uncle boil them up for the required six or so hours in the old fashioned copper which he still has, but I can't be doing with that much steam in my kitchen!  I buy a small one from a supermarket for myself which will be wheat and dairy free and then I will also get a larger one for the family.  I know that the YFG won't touch it and the EFG only eats it as a vehicle for the brandy butter - she isn't interested in it with custard.We are coming up to a week of baking - it is the village Christmas Bazaar on Sunday when I am helping my friend M with the refreshments there and have been asked to make mince pies, but I will also be making things for the church's cake stall.  We are also having a Coffee morning at church the following Friday and then on Saturday, another chapel are lending us their ladies' choir for a concert of Christmas music for the evening.  More mince pies/cakes/biccies required for those - no wonder I am heading out to the shops this afternoon to stock up on the flour, oats, mincemeat, margerine, etc.."},
{"title": "Governor politics", "date": "Wednesday 18 November 2009", "text": "I'm going to be honest and say that there is governor on our board whom I really do not like, and he has had three digs at me tonight, and I am peeved.  There, I've said it, out in the open.He's probably not chuffed that I was nominated vice chair this year and he didn't get the job, but he took it off me the year before and I didn't mind, so what's he got to worry about?!  He rarely volunteers for any of the jobs, but made these cracks tonight about me volunteering for everything.   What is the point of being a governor if you are just going to sit on your backside and watch everyone else do the work?  I've just been co-opted back on for another four years, so he's going to have to put up with me a while longer!Apart from all that, my dear neighbour's father is stranded in Cyprus, with possible lung cancer and needs to come back to the UK for treatment as the base there can't give it, but we are struggling to get him back here as the medivac plane can't bring him - he did serve in the RAF years ago but is now 88 and apparently not eligible for transport.   We don't know right now whether a civilian flight would accept him, given his fragile state of health, and so both M and her mum are stressed and worried and her poor dad was just in floods on the phone this afternoon.  It is just possible that they would allow him on the civilian flight if he had a nurse with him, and the EFG's godmother is a nurse, and is willing, but we aren't sure if her qualifications are suitable for the job, so there are things to find out.  They were here for Christmas last year and went back for the summer in March, and were due to come home to M for Christmas again this year, flights are booked and all, but now his health is deteriorating badly.  If you are inclined, please say a prayer for them."},
{"title": "MIA - What a week!", "date": "Monday 16 November 2009", "text": "Well, I was truly \"in action\" as it was a really busy week with something happening out of the ordinary every day.....where to begin?Monday was interesting because a fellow Governor and I had to go to the school at 3.15 pm to do a Building inspection - sort of health and safety - and we had never done one before so it was steep learning curve.  The Head and the Caretaker knew what they were looking for, and we spent nearly two hours poking round all the classrooms, investigating stuff.  It was interesting, and we had a long list of things by the time 5pm rolled around - nothing too major and all easily actionable.After that, I came home for a quick cuppa and then took the FH and EFG to band practice - one to participate, one to listen, and the YFG and I went to the gym to set out the apparatus with the HC for about an hour.  We got that sorted out, fetched the band brigade and headed home for supper.Tuesday morning I had an earlier-than-usual start as I was at the gym at 8.45am to help with some classes for the kids at the school as a favour to the head of PE there.  The kids were having an immersion day (whatever one of those is) and a lot of them were doing various sports for the morning.  They were Y8 and 9 and so were consequently quite large!  It was amusing but also irritating that some of the girls weren't in the mood to even have a go at a lot of it, in case it mucked their hair up - seriously!  One of the teachers confided that the age they are at is a bad one for trying new things as they are very self-conscious and don't like to be the centre of attention when they are doing PE.  If that is the case, I don't understand why the teachers asked us to do gym with them all morning.......we weren't impressed with their effort or attitude so I will be a bit reluctant to do it again.I was able to pick a friend's little boy up from school for her at 3pm as she had to be elsewhere, and then went back at about 3.45pm for the YFG; her Performing Arts class had been cancelled as the teacher hadn't turned up (an external company runs this course) so we were called to pick up our kids.  The YFG and I trundled off to gym at 4.30pm for the 5pm class and were there until 8pm.Wednesday was a pretty run-of-the-mill day until 3pm when the YFG was involved in a football match for the school in an inter-village tournament in another village nearby.  That was a new experience for both of us!  They won one, lost one and drew two, so all in all they came third of five teams; holding their own and doing pretty well, I thought.  All the dads and coaches/PE teachers/Headmasters shouting on the touchline was a pretty raucous noise and not one I was prepared for - this was a \"B\" team event, and they were Y5/6 kids, not Aston Villa vs Chelsea!Thursday morning saw me clambering round the window sills at the church, helping with a pre-Christmas spring-clean!  I was cleaning the windows, and then I brushed the outside of the windows as there was rather a colony of spiders on the outside of each one.  The sun shone in a little brighter when I had finished.  I then did some hoovering and we were all done by lunchtime.In the afternoon, I loaded up the car to take books to sell at a shopping evening for the NSPCC not too far away, but over the county line into Norfolk.  There were people of a rather more affluent nature there, but they still didn't spend terribly well, unfortunately.  It was a well-attended evening, and I did a little shopping myself.  The downside was the torrential rain when we had to clear up - I had the back door of the Volvo estate open so I could load up all the boxes and then when I went to put it down, an absolute torrent of water came off it and fell all down my legs.  Wearing sodden jeans was no fun and so I stopped the car in the dark half a mile further on from the hall and took them off!Friday morning the whole family was up before daybreak so that we could all be ready to leave the house shortly after 7.15am as the FH and I were at a big show for the day and the girls went to our lovely neighbour until it was time to go to school.  The show went well, although we were on our feet all day - but it was good fun and we do enjoy being together at things like this.  On the way home, the FH dropped me off at the gym and I taught two classes; the YFG had got there with a friend, and then the HC brought us home at 8.40pm.  I had a really good evening at gym as the first class was great and then I coached the boys' class with a volunteer helper whilst the HC took the YFG and her friend S for an extra hour's coaching, just the two of them working hard together.  I enjoyed leading the class for a change, and it was a pleasure!Saturday I grabbed a lie-in until 8am so I didn't get to gym until about 10.15 with the YFG for the second class.  We have been working with some of the older girls to put on a little display at Christmas so we spent some time on that, which is a challenge, trying to get all the girls to co-ordinate their arms and legs to go in the same direction at the same time AND stay in time with the music.  We have a few more weeks to practise, thank goodness.We went shopping - food from Sainsbury's and hamster things (bedding and stuff for the bottom of the cage) from the pet shop, where the YFG also bought her two hamsters a new cage as the tank they had been in was not working out for them - too much condensation!  She bought quite a posh one with lots of accessories included, so they got moved to their new home once we got back.  They spent a lot of time investigating everything, and seem to have settled in really well.After the shopping we then came home to get the school uniforms washed and all the shopping put away.  Saturday evening was largely spent conked out, watching Strictly and just getting up at intervals to re-boot the washing machine!  An early night was in order as we were all at the show again on Sunday.The girls like to come to some of the shows with us for the shopping opportunities that they provide.  They were given a £5 each and told not to ask more more - they stretched those fivers to within an inch, both coming back with a good haul of goodies for their money, including legwarmers (They do say fashion comes in cycles - I remember having a royal blue pair in the 80s!), cosmetics, sweets, and bits of stationery.  The YFG was looking forward to having a go on the ice rink, but we watched some others on it and decided not to bother as it was just plastic tiles on the floor and people were not able to skate properly, so we thought it wasn't worth the £2 they were charging.There was an interesting phone call from the EFG at one point in the afternoon; we had taken our little trailer as we had books to return to the boss, and the girls used it as their retreat, somewhere to go and play on their DSs and to picnic.  It has a roller-shutter door on the back, and they get in and pull it down most of the way for warmth and privacy.  The EFG was out there alone and some helpful soul pulled the shutter right down and put the clasp in so she was trapped.  The person obviously (we hope!!) didn't realise that she was in there, so she called me on her mobile to have me send the YFG to let her out.  We all had a good laugh over that, her included!Last night, we were home by 6.30pm so that the girls could watch the Dr Who special whilst I fixed a quick bangers and mash tea - and it was so quick I used Smash!!  My dad rang to say that they had had news of a death - the man that dad worked for for years and years, and who is my sister's godfather died yesterday morning.  He was just six months younger than dad but his health had been failing in recent weeks.  It was the end of an era as he had been a prominent coaching company owner in the area for about 25 years, although the company had been bought up in the 80s by a bigger company.  In coaching history, he's there in the books!  (By coaching here, I mean the bus industry, not sports coaching).I ironed the school uniforms and the gang were all in bed by about 9.30pm although I watched a film until about 11pm.  Today I feel quite worn out, and have just finished off the ironing and done another load of washing but nothing too energetic at all!The FH has also had the swine flu jab at some point this week, but I can't remember which day - may have been Thursday evening.  The Jane Austen tapes have also been posted to Carole this afternoon - what with the postal strikes at the start of the month and then rushing around last week, they had been delayed.  Hope you like them, and enjoy your ironing as you listen.  They should be with you within a couple of days!"},
{"title": "Another weekend passed", "date": "Monday 9 November 2009", "text": "This weekend has been very enjoyable in a number of ways.  Saturday morning was gymnastics as usual, but I taught the little boys' class as their regular coach was away.  That was an experience as I had not taught them on my own before and it was interesting to see what they could (and couldn't!) do.  There were only 4 of them this week so it was a good little group for an hour.  After that, I worked with some girls and then helped the choreographer with a group of girls trying to learn a routine for a display at our Christmas event in the middle of December.Saturday afternoon was a bit of rushing around to make some more refreshments for the church evening.  I only got the chocolate cake made on Friday, as I ran out of time, so I had to make the cheese scones on Saturday afternoon, and the Twinks biscuits didn't get made at all.  We also had a bit of a last minute escapade with the music as the EFG had not finished the playlist on the laptop for the evening's music so I had to help her with that.  I had thought that she would do that whilst we were at the gym in the morning, but it was not to be.  We got it done in time, anyway.  Then the FH's cousin arrived with his wife and daughter at 4pm to come to the church with us.  There was apparently a few comments from the daughter about not coming to church but the FH didn't give her the choice and she had to come.  Why come to someone's house knowing that the whole point of the visit was to go to church if you didn't intend to go to church? (She's in her forties so it is not as if she was made to come!!)     My uncle also came for the evening, arriving at about 5.45pm but he had already eaten so it didn't matter that the rest of the gang were munching the sandwiches when he arrived.The evening itself went very well; the other ladies of the church had made a lovely spread of sandwiches and snacks for the interval, to which I added my contribution, and there were some excellent raffle prizes, too.  I've learned to pick up things that might be useful for raffles whenever I see something nice that is cheap or reduced as we are frequently asked for prizes for various things!  We had a good attendance from the members of our church as well as from other churches on the local Methodist circuit.  All in all there were probably about 45 people there, which is a good turnout for a little village!  We raised £120 for the church funds, so I was very pleased with that.  The singing went well too and the general opinion was that people had enjoyed the evening and are looking forward to doing it again!Sunday morning saw us back at church for Rememberance Day at 9.30am, which was a good service.  After church, we did various jobs around the house, had baked potatoes for lunch, had to nip out and do some shopping, and then I cooked a roast dinner for tea.  Whilst that was cooking, the girls cleaned out the rabbits and the EFG had an unfortunate accident, falling over in some mud and ending up needing a bath.  She took her bath whilst the YFG went to our friend's house to pick up a new pair of bantams; they are Gold-laced Sebrights, which hatched in the summer.  They are happily investigating their new house this morning, and seem fine.  They cost me a bag of corn and one of layer's mash, so they were cheap!"},
{"title": "Christmas Cake recipe", "date": "Friday 6 November 2009", "text": "I thought that some people might be interested in my Christmas cake recipe.....It is from Family Circle magazine (now no longer published) and I first made it in December 2000, so it has been around a while!This makes one 8\" round cake.On Day One, I mix together:8oz raisins, 7oz sultanas, 7oz currants, 6oz no-soak dried apricots, 2oz glace cherries, 2oz chopped mixed nuts, 2oz chopped mixed peel, 7tbsp brandy and 6tbsp orange juice. This is mixed together and covered, and then frequently stirred again throughout the next 24 hours, so we are now onto Day Three - Day Two is spent stirring and enjoying the aromas!Day Three - grease and line the tin.  Preheat the oven to 150C/GM2.Cream 8oz softened butter with 8oz dark brown sugar.  Gradually add in 4 beaten eggs, each with a little flour.  Total flour to be added is 8oz so use a little at a time and then add whatever is left with the spices: 1tsp cinnamon, half a tsp ground allspice, half a tsp ground ginger and quarter tsp grated nutmeg (fresh if possible).  At this point, I also add in the grated zest of a lemon and an orange. Once the basic mixture is together, the fruit can be very gently folded into it.Then I put the mixture into the tin for baking, levelling it off and making a small dip in the middle.  It needs to cook for about 3 hours - it may take a little longer but no more than 3 hours and 15 minutes.  When a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean, it is done.  If it is getting too darkly coloured, I just pop a double layer of greaseproof paper over the top to shield it a little.Leave it in the tin until it is completely cold - I leave it to the next day.  Then take it out of the tin and take off all the greaseproof paper wrappings.  Re-wrap in fresh paper and then some foil as well, and store in a tin in a cool place until we need to marzipan/decorate them. In addition to the brandy we used to soak the fruit, I also make fork holes in the base of the cake and pour a capful of brandy over it, probably three times between now and when I will put the marzipan on."},
{"title": "Historical cake tin", "date": "Friday 6 November 2009", "text": "I have just unwrapped the Christmas cakes from their greaseproof paper, ready to be re-wrapped and then encased in tinfoil and put in a tin until the time comes to marzipan them, nearer to the big day.  It struck me that one of the tins I use is a very old one, which my grandfather used in his bakery, and which my father gave to me years ago. Since my grandfather was at least the second generation to run that bakehouse, it is possible that that cake tin is over a hundred years old - antique, in fact!  Apparently, once the bread baking was done for the day, the bakehouse used to produce some fruitcakes, and this is one of the tins they used to make those in. I don't make fruitcake very often as the FGs don't like raisins and sultanas in their food, so it doesn't get much use on a regular basis but I do find it good for the seasonal baking as it is a very solid tin and allows the cakes to bake evenly.I have had an hour outside this morning, feeding and watering the hens, moving a rabbit house around, watering a couple of rabbits which the YFG seems to have overlooked this morning, and then doing a bit of general tidying up around the garden.  The Partridge Orpington/Black Orp/Gold-laced Orp run has also been moved along the grass a little as the rain is turning everywhere to mud.  There looks to be one Partridge Cockerel and four hens, and I think that the Blacks and the Gold-laced might all be hens too.  Having a ready-made group of Partridge ones will be excellent come the spring and I shall try to breed another lot from them next summer, and I shall be looking for some more Gold-laced eggs to hatch as well, as one on its own is not a lot of good, except for looking pretty!!Now I am going to make a chocolate sheet cake, some Twinks and some cheese scones for the Songs of Praise evening tomorrow - although I am not kidding myself that they will all make it there as the gang here love the cheese scones with a passion - better make a double batch!!"},
{"title": "A quiet day at home", "date": "Thursday 5 November 2009", "text": "I have had a peaceful day today with the FH.  It was less peaceful after 3pm, but it was still good all in all!  This morning, as I couldn't find anything I could eat that I wanted to eat for breakfast, I made a crumble out of some pears and pineapple that were lurking in the fridge.  The FH and I enjoyed that at about 9.30am once all the animal chores were tended to, and then we settled down to the morning's work: laundry for me as it was a good, blowy day outside so I was getting stuff washed and out on the line, in between ironing the last lot! The FH was sitting at the table, sorting out the hymns for the Songs of Praise evening we are organising at church on Saturday.  It took him quite some time, and in the end I had to help him.  Lunchtime came and went, and then all too soon it was time to fetch the YFG from school and chat with some of the mums.  I have missed that lately as the YFG has been cycling to and fro to school but now that the weather is colder and a lot wetter lately, she is more reluctant and I am the mum-taxi service again!!After school, we went to town to get the EFG some football boots as she is playing rugby for the rest of the term and has been told she must have a pair as the ground is so slippery.  There went £25 very quickly - she has such wide feet that we had to get a pair of men's size 6.5!  The YFG also got a pair of black school shoes for a more reasonable £8.  We took a neighbour with us, and went to Tesco as well, so our neighbour could have a look around.  She is older and has no transport, relying on her family to get her out of the village, so she appreciates a ride out now and again.  Her family are very busy, working full time, so it is hard for them to fit in, I suppose.This evening, I am going to get out some cookbooks and do a bit of menu planning, and then do some knitting.  I know it is gone 10pm already, but I will probably stay downstairs until about 11pm tonight!  I also want to look at some cake recipes for the Songs of Praise evening."},
{"title": "And the lights went out..........", "date": "Wednesday 4 November 2009", "text": "Most inconveniently, last night at the gym, there was a power cut!  We had just finished the first class and the girls were arriving to start the second, when all but the emergency lights went out.  The resulting dim lighting was not sufficient to take a class so we had to pack up early and send the kids home.  Result was an early night all round - and the HC gave me some more of his delicious Picasso potatoes.Today I have finally made the Christmas cakes - the last pair are in the oven right now and the house smells divine!  I have made two loaf shaped ones and two round ones - I am sure that one loaf will get eaten rather soon and will never make it through to Christmas.  The others will be wrapped and stored somewhere safe until nearer the time, although I will have to \"feed\" them with brandy regularly.I just have to rave about a new book I bought - it is just Gorgeous!!  It is called Gorgeous Christmas and is by Annie Bell , continuing in her \"gorgeous\" series.  I already have the cake book so when I saw this one for £4.99 at the Book People, I had to get it, and it didn't disappoint.The photography is superb so it is almost worthy of being a coffee table book, but the recipes are great too: puddings, baking, leftovers, gifts, \"hand-me-rounds\", the big birds - chapter headings which just don't do the recipes justice.  Look it up in the library, ogle it in the bookshop but find one somewhere!!  I'll be trying some of the ideas out soon, so I'll report back.We have had the YFG's parents' consultations this afternoon - she's doing very well in all areas and could do with a little kick up the backside in Maths.  She is showing a lot of potential and knows her number facts, but is frightened of having a go in case she gets it wrong, apparently.  However, the level that she is recorded as having got to now is not a significant improvement on where she was when she entered school two years ago, so I will be making some enquiries as to why this hasn't been picked up before..."},
{"title": "Jane Austen", "date": "Monday 2 November 2009", "text": "I haven't forgotten about the tapes giveaway - what with the holiday and getting ready for it, I just haven't got round to doing the draw........I will do it now......the winner is...Caroline!Hopefully they will make the ironing less of a chore for you, Caroline.  Please send me a comment (which I won't publish) with your name and address, and I'll get them in the post this week.  Fingers crossed you like them.Everyone else, watch out for some more giveaways in the weeks to come as I am in a decluttering mood and there may be more treasures in store.Note to the Mom over the seas in Ohio - a new neighbour got me some pumpkin from the base and I made your pumpkin bread today but she got the 29oz cans so I ended up making four loaves instead of two......and news from your old house - the beautiful pantry I so envied has been made into a downstairs shower room!!  To explain that to everyone else, the Mom rented a house not too far from here which was a Methodist manse - it was vacant because two local Methodist ministers were married to each other and only needed one of the manses, instead of one each, so there was a spare for a while.  It is a gorgeous old house with lovely big rooms, and there was a great pantry.  Now that the new minister moved in about 18 months ago, he happens to be our minister at our church - he's the Superintendent of the area. I was telling him that I loved his house and that I was envious of the pantry as these modern houses are sadly lacking in the pantry department, and he said that it had been made into a shower room; I am sure that his family are finding that useful!  You can see I have a serious pantry-envy problem, I can tell!  I did have one once, I promise.I haven't made the Christmas cakes yet as the YFG was too busy today with friends and going with the FH to his art club.  Unfortunately she is back to school tomorrow so I think that I will have to make them on my own anyway."},
{"title": "Scents of autumn", "date": "Sunday 1 November 2009", "text": "Yesterday it was the colours, today the smells!  This afternoon, I prepared and chopped all the dried fruit for two Christmas cakes, and they are now soaking up brandy and orange juice in the kitchen until tomorrow, when they'll get used to make the cakes.......can't wait - then the smells will really be good!!!This morning's DIY service at church went well - we lasted just on the allotted hour with no problem, and the music, played from the EFG's laptop, worked well.  I was relieved about that.  Now we have to do a Songs of Praise evening on Saturday with the same method - say a prayer for us!!  It should be fine, but I am sure that someone will want to sing a hymn we don't have the music for.  Always the way!We had a late lunch at 2pm of my sausage plait, lots (nearly said \"lashings\" there!) of gravy, roast potatoes, carrots and broccoli, then I made a microwave sponge pudding with pineapple.  That lot sorted them all out for the afternoon!!  They have only just managed a little sandwich and cake for tea, and now I am going for my Sunday night treat, Doc Martin on the TV and my feet up on the sofa.  Uncle J has been persuaded to stay for one more night, and the YFG is looking forward to helping me with the baking tomorrow - might take some photos too if the weather stays fine."},
{"title": "Colours of Day", "date": "Saturday 31 October 2009", "text": "The place we have spent the last few nights is in a woodland at Kelling Heath on the North Norfolk coast near Sheringham.  The woods are clothed in their most majestic attire at this time of year - russet reds, gold, yellow, warm browns, beautiful colours, which are just amazing.  We had a lovely couple of days there, and I did take some really good photos.....we lost them in the transfer to the laptop so I was a bit miffed with the EFG over that, but hey ho and all that..what is done is done and hopefully we'll go back this time next year and I can try again!We left here a bit later than we hoped on Thursday but even with a quick stop at Morrison's in Fakenham, we still arrived by about 2pm, which gave us plenty of time to saunter around for a while and relax.  It gets dark so quickly these days that we had had supper, washed up and settled in for the evening by 6.30pm!  That first night, we watched \"In Pursuit of Happyness\" which stars Will Smith and his son.  It is an inspiring film, and one I hadn't seen before.  One to watch, if you haven't already seen it.Friday we got up late and pootled around the caravan until about 11.30 and then went to Cromer.  The FH snoozed in the car whilst the girls of the family hit the shops and grabbed some fish and chips for lunch, then I drove whilst they ate and we headed off to Holt.  As I remember saying before, Holt is posher than Cromer and Sheringham, but we love them all for their own attractions.  I was angry with a shop assistant in Holt who refused to accept a Scottish tenner because of the risk of forgery.....I suppose some people can only cope with keeping track of one set of notes whereas in Scotland we have three or more issuing banks, and they all issue all the notes - so that makes at least 15 notes to know instead of only four - there are still pound notes up north too!!  I went into Barclays and changed it for a more acceptable version.  In Holt there is a very posh department store called \"Bakers & Larners\" and it sells pretty much everything you could possibly want - food, wine, clothes, books, stationery, cookware, housewares, soft furnishings, shoes.......it is really very nice - and it sells things that other shops don't bother with, too, so we like to have a good browse in there. After Holt, it was back to the caravan for another little wander and then I cooked myself some supper and made the others more of a high tea with sandwiches, cake and a little pud.  The movie of that evening was Inkheart - I remember buying the book for the EFG but she says that she found it boring - the film wasn't boring but it wasn't as good as the Will Smith one of the previous night, and I watched it with only half my attention as I was knitting again.  Again - well, I knitted last time we went there, and I brought it back to do more, but I hadn't done any in the meantime.  Shame on me.Today dawned rather damp but totally in keeping with the autumnal feeling in the air.  We packed a little and then went to Sheringham to poke around the market and the shops.  Two hours later, we had bought the Christmas puzzle, some books, some new woolly hats, some sweets, etc and had some very fresh sea air.  The streets were busy and there was a surprise on the High Street.  The town which has been fighting hard against the intrusion of Tesco has allowed a Sainsbury Local to go into the old Woolworths' store.  It is due to open on 10 November, so I wonder what the effect will be on all the lovely little shops which the townspeople of Sheringham have treasured for so long.  I would love to understand the rationale for letting Sainsbury in but fighting so hard against Tesco.  I would have thought that all the same arguments would apply.After our shopping expedition, we returned to the caravan for some lunch and then had a lovely hour sitting round the table playing cards with the girls.  The YFG is delighted to have got the hang of whist now and wants to play often - she has had Uncle J playing tonight already.  We left the caravan and headed home, stopping off at a restaurant for a meal near King's Lynn. I seem to have come home to a lot of news - one blogger has announced a pregnancy, one neighbour came round with some hot gossip almost as soon as we got home, I had 80 odd emails to download, and I am a bit overwhelmed tonight with it all!  Time to have a bath and think about tomorrow's service at church, I think!"},
{"title": "Busy bees here", "date": "Wednesday 28 October 2009", "text": "We are dashing around like mad things today - and last night I was up till 1.30am ironing all the heap to get it put away so that Uncle J didn't have it cluttering up the place.  Today I have had the Asda delivery, a Book People delivery and a UPS collection, so it was just as well that we didn't need to go far.  The FH went out to his lunch as usual, but the rest of the gang stayed close to home; the EFG finished her room, although the YFG was allowed to rollerskate around the estate a few times (well, she was out there about an hour) as she got hers finished a day or two ago.  I have spent a lot of time today preparing the service for Sunday, and it is now done!!  Yay - what a relief!  I also made Uncle J's bed up and hoovered the room for him - just the bathrooms to clean tonight now and then another basketful of ironing to do from today's washing.In the morning the FH has a man coming at 10am to see to the extra piece we need to get on the chimney, so our departure will be delayed a little.  That gives me an extra couple of hours to pack in the morning, and to clean out a henhouse!!  I'll be needing a shower after that and then we should be ready to go - hoping to be out of here by 11am and at the caravan by 1pm for lunch.  Planning an easy afternoon - perhaps a walk around the park there and then relaxing with some knitting and a book/DVD in the evening.  All depends on the weather as usual.Lost the camera so finding that is on the list to do before we go - so hoping to be back here Saturday night or Sunday afternoon, with or without photos.  Have a lovely weekend, everyone!"},
{"title": "Preparations", "date": "Monday 26 October 2009", "text": "We are going for a little holiday on Thursday but there is a LOT to get done before we go: the house needs to be cleaned and tidied as Uncle J will be moving in for two nights whilst we are away, the henhouses need cleaning out again, there is a mountain of washing to be ironed - yesterday was such a glorious day that I washed everything that needed it, and some quilts too - and there is also the service for All Saint's Day to have ready before we go.  It's coming along but there is still some work to go on it - I've got to find the preparations I have already done!Tonight, Uncle J has been over to see what is what as we will be leaving on Thursday morning but he won't get here until the late afternoon.  We have had a feast of chicken pie, roast potatoes, carrots, runner beans and then pear and chocolate sponge for pudding!  We are all well and truly stuffed!  Whilst I was busy cooking all that, the FH took the EFG to band practice and Uncle J went along to listen.  I think he enjoyed it; he is a man of few words.This morning, my dad came over to pick up a bag of carrots.  His partner, MB, has had some bad news - her daughter's husband died on Thursday evening. He was only in his forties, and they are not really sure what caused his death, but most disturbingly, he unfortunately died on the lounge floor in front of his wife and two teenage children.  My heart goes out to the whole family.  Poor MB is just in a terrible state - she looks as if she hasn't slept at all and is very distracted at the moment.  It was her birthday on Saturday, but I don't think there were any celebrations, understandably.  I had never met the chap, nor any other members of the family, but I love MB and I am so sorry for what she is going through right now. The hamster is back in his cage, thank goodness! Yesterday after church, the FGs went home with another family for the rest of the day and were returned to us at 4.45pm.  The FH and I spent most of the time in the garden, having a tidying up session - removing the canes from the runner beans, emptying the tomato troughs and putting the spent compost on the garden beds, and putting the tomato plants, now dead, into the hen run for the girls to peck through.  We let one lot of hens out so that they could have a good peck through the soil in the garden beds, and they had lots of dirt baths and really enjoyed their afternoon out.  We still have weeds to clear, and broad beans to sow, but we are making progress.  I do like cleaning the garden up for the winter - it is like putting it to bed!Well, no one likes Jane Austen apart from BB and Caroline, you all live overseas, or you have all had a busy weekend and not had time to read and post.......whatever the reason, I'm giving you another day!"},
{"title": "Jane Austen giveaway", "date": "Friday 23 October 2009", "text": "I have a set of Jane Austen audio tapes - P&P, S&S, Persuasion, Emma, Northanger Abbey, and Mansfield Park.  They are the Women's Hour set, read by Maria Aitken, Juliet Stevenson, Penelope Keith, Janet Suzman, Patricia Hodge and Annette Crosbie. I bought them years ago when I was working as a silver service waitress whilst at uni.  The famous golf Open Championship came to St Andrews and we had to work extra shifts, and at the end of the week, we were given a bonus - it was about £60 and I spent it on this set of tapes.  Very extravagant of me, but there were no kids back then and I had worked hard and thought that as it was a bonus, I would treat myself to something I wanted.  I enjoyed listening to some of the tapes whilst I was ironing, and travelling, but I haven't touched them in the five and a half years that we  have been here, so I think that it is time that someone else got some pleasure from them.I can't afford to post them internationally, so UK comments only please and apologies to others.  Let me have a comment about why you would like them, if you would!  I'll give you all until Sunday night to post something and then I will put all the comments in the hat and let one of the FGs choose one.  Good luck!  If no one wants them, I'll give them to a charity shop...."},
{"title": "Neighbours", "date": "Thursday 22 October 2009", "text": "No, not the Australian soap, unfortunately - the real folk who live next door. On one side, we have an absolutely lovely family who are renting the house and we have become good friends.  On the other side, we have a couple, and they are a pain in the you-know-where.  We put our verandah up a couple of years ago, and they complained to the council, so a nice enforcement officer had to come out and look at it - it was fine as we knew it would be, but she still caused hassle.  Then there was the cockerel issue - the first complaint was someone else, but the second was her.  And now, it's the woodburner.  The letter that came from the council today says that we are causing a smoke nuisance! We are amused and angered by this, as we haven't actually had it alight for the last 5 months, so she is obviously more worried about the smoke which might come out over the winter than the smoke which has been non-existent all summer.  The chap I spoke to on the phone couldn't actually say much about it as he knew little - as long as we burn clean wood which doesn't make dark smoke, he doesn't see that there is a problem, and is quite willing to come and look at our smoke!!It angers us that someone thinks that they have the right to dictate to us what we can do in our own home - we investigate these things before we do them and we know that we are allowed to do them before we invest our time, effort and money in doing them.  All these letters keep raising the FH's blood pressure each time, and my itchy feet just get more and more itchy!  I spent the afternoon on the internet looking for alternative houses!  I am getting to the stage where I don't feel that I want to live next to such an interfering busybody.....Not only do I have a hamster still on the loose in the kitchen (the trap is too small, we have decided), I have seen a rat this morning, and it shot back under the compost bin when it saw me, so I guess that it may be living under there with its mates/family.  It is the first one I have seen since about two years ago - and it was a shock to my system this morning.  I am very particular about not overfeeding the hens, so that there is no spare food lying around, and if the FH accidentally puts too much in the feeders in the afternoon, I always take the feeders in to the workshop for the night.  However, I have realised that I should be doing it much earlier now that the nights are drawing in and I must get out there and shut the doors as soon as it gets dark.  The FH rarely makes a mistake with the food, but I don't want to take any chances.  The sooner the rat family starve into moving house, the better - and I do have a rat trap I can put down but it only kills one at a time....shame!  I am reluctant to use poison because of the cat and the couple of hens which free-range - although they could get shut in for a while if needs be. The chickens think that they are in heaven this morning, I think, as I have put a thick layer of straw in the yards as the ground is so muddy.  It is as much for my benefit as theirs, though, as the mud was so slippery last night that I was in danger of going down on my bum!  We bought several bales of straw a few weeks ago specifically for this purpose as once the winter rains start, the yards do get into a bad state and this is the best remedy for the hens to be comfortable.  They love pecking through the straw!We had to put the big white rabbit out of her misery last night, as she was suffering with the illness that has struck all her babies.  I have buried her this morning.  Her last remaining baby is in a box in the kitchen - he has the illness but is still Ok at the moment - we are bathing his eyes twice daily with the Optrex and giving him tiny amounts of Calpol.  He is still showing signs of normal rabbit activity like washing himself and chewing the box, as well as eating, so there is hope for him yet.  The breeders we spoke to said that the rabbits can get over this illness, although ours aren't doing so well.The EFG has gone to school in a good mood as she breaks up for half-term today whereas the YFG has to go to school tomorrow as well!  On the flip side, the YFG gets the Monday after the holiday off as well whilst the EFG is straight back to school on the Monday morning!  Why can't these schools co-ordinate their training days so that all the children in the area get the same days off?!  It would be so much easier.  However, it does give me a day with each daughter on her own, which will go down well with them.Well, today I am home alone until about lunchtime as the FH is out and about.  I have grand plans to get things done, so I had better get the rubber gloves out and start on the bathrooms!"},
{"title": "What a Wednesday...", "date": "Wednesday 21 October 2009", "text": "This morning we woke to some plumbing troubles!  Our houses here are not on the mains sewer so we have \"treatment plants\" in the garden - posh cesspits, in other words.  They are supposed to treat the water so that it can be discharged, and the solids are supposed to sink and then be emptied every year to two years.  We are not impressed with the sewage system here - the pipes in the garden have not been laid with enough fall and so water (etc...) sits in them, and when certain younger members of the family use too much loo paper, the lack of fall means that there is not enough pressure on the water and its load to push it all through the pipes, and we get a backlog.......we got a backlog this morning and the loos weren't flushing properly.  First I had to get the chickens into their adjacent run as the lid of the tank is in their run.  I also had to scrape a couple of inches of mud and chicken poo off the top of it, and wedge it open.  It needed emptying, so at 8am I phoned the local man who does this for a living and asked for an emptying.  His wife wondered if we could wait until Monday and I said no, if he wanted the job it had to be done today.  He came at 4pm, and did a good job.  But the pipes were still bunged in the garden so I had to pick up some draining rods from a friend and get my rubber gloves out.  Managed to clear it quite quickly, thank goodness.  I suppose I can now add Sanitation Engineer to my list of experiences!!  As we only pay for the water coming into the house, our water bills are quite a lot lower than they were when we lived in town and had to pay sewage charges as well, and the chap charges £65 for an emptying - this is usually once every 8 - 12 months, so it is not bad economically - and he has charged the same for the last 5 years!The EFG's eyes were giving her some problems so I managed yesterday to get a short-notice appointment for a check up this afternoon.  Relieved to report that her eyes are fine and her prescription remains unchanged.  The optician did tighten her glasses a little as they tend to slip down her nose and she peers over them instead of looking through them, which I didn't think would be doing her any good.  If her eyes continue to cause her pain, we are to go to the doctor, but the optician did say that the recent colds we have had could well have affected her eyes and might take some time to get back to normal.  The appointment was at 4.30, so as soon as she got off the school bus and got changed, off we had to pootle.  We got there dead on the dot!Today I have also been a hairdresser - my friend D's little boy likes me to cut his hair!  It is not hard as he has a number 3 all over with the clippers.  It takes about 10 minutes and I like to do it for him, as he is such a sweet little boy of 7.  I fitted that in between picking up the YFG from school and waiting for the school bus to bring the EFG home.  I sat and chatted with his mum for a while - we are both school governors, both have girls in the same class at school and both have the challenges of living on a budget, so we have a lot to talk about - too much, sometimes!Tomorrow evening we have to go to the EFG's school for an Open Evening for the YFG as she will be moving up there next September, and the transitioning has already begun.  We go tomorrow for a look around and asking questions, if we want to.  Then later in the year, she will go on a supervised day at the college with her teachers and they will spend a lot of time in the library, doing various activities.  In the summer term, then, they will go on an unsupervised trip when they take the bus with the other kids, and have to shadow some current Y7s around.  The YFG is ready for this, I think, and very excited about it all - I just can't believe that my younger child will be at secondary school within the year!!  Then they will both be out of the house between 8 and 4, and I think that my day will be longer - maybe it will be time to look for some career development or a job.......watch that space.......I'll have to work on that."},
{"title": "Tuesday turnabout", "date": "Tuesday 20 October 2009", "text": "Today has been one of those days! The YFG has a swimming lesson at school, then a Performing Arts after school club and then two hours at gym - by which time she is running out of steam.  The EFG has sore eyes, a badly dried bottom lip and mouth ulcers, so we are going to the optician tomorrow for the eyes and we'll need to go to the chemist for the lip and the ulcer.  There are poorly rabbits again - they seem to be picking up some kind of virus - probably snuffles - and there is nothing we can do except make their last days as comfortable as we can: the latest has just shown symptoms tonight so we have administered the Calpol and Optrex and he is snuggled into the FH's shirt and they are both sitting, dozing, watching the Ten O'Clock News! So that is all the miserable news from here...on a more positive note, the FH has finished his course of antibiotics and his cough is receding nicely, as is mine.  I am definitely on the mend now!    My friend D has brought us a humane mouse trap to borrow in an attempt to catch the meandering hamster.  Only downside is that it is built for MICE and not large hamsters, so we are wondering whether he will actually squeeze himself into it!!  If he is hungry enough, he probably will - so we have baited it with his favourite nosh and we have fingers crossed for a successful capture tonight!"},
{"title": "Gymnastics at the O2 arena", "date": "Sunday 18 October 2009", "text": "I have been glued to the television this afternoon, watching the men's vault final, the women's beam and floor finals and the men's P-bars final.  Yesterday I saw the men's rings as well - that Iordan Iovchev from Bulgaria is doing amazingly for someone of 36 - silver medal if I remember rightly, and then today the men's vault Gold medallist was 29, from Romania. But the wonderful news today was that Beth Tweddle won Gold on the floor!!  She went first, and then the next gymnast, from Columbia, had a nasty fall and there was some delay until she was stretchered off, so the following gymnasts had to watch and wait.  Beth's tension as she waited for each girl's score to come up was clearly visible - you could almost see her wondering whether any of them would knock her off the top spot.  Her fall from the bars meant that she didn't make that final so the floor was her best chance, and she did an excellent routine with some brilliant tumbles.Aside from gymnastics, I have cooked, ironed, hoovered, tidied, cleaned and surfed on the net.  Didn't make it to church as none of us are feeling 100% and thought we had better keep our germs to ourselves.  We are on the mend though!  I've also watched Doc Martin on ITV tonight - he's hilarious!Yesterday the FGs had a lovely time out with their Aunty M at the Disney on Ice show at the Birmingham NIA.  They were amazed by the costumes, the dancing and the ability of the ice dancers - although they did notice a couple of small falls, they said.  They brought home a programme so we could also see the costumes, and the YFG has been showing it to her friend today.  I think that some thank-you letters are in order this week.  In true Fen fashion, they noticed and were disgusted by the prices being charged at the Arena - £2.50 for a bag of Haribo sweets that retail for about a £1 in Tesco, horrendous prices for rubbish like burgers and chips, and the programme was £8, apparently.  Still, they were given £5 each pocket money and they both brought it home to put it away for other things as they decided that there was nothing there that they wanted and they are both saving up for things that they do really want!!  Well taught, I think!!The hamster is still out and about, although I am taking up BB's suggestion of a humane mouse trap - that is on the \"acquire\" list this week.  Not sure where I'll get one from but the hardware shop in town might have just the thing.  One joker said I should just put the cat in the kitchen for the night - that's a bad idea on two counts: one - that I do actually want this thing alive as it cost me £5 and I don't want it roaming my house for ever, and two - if the cat gets it in the night and eats it, I won't have any evidence as to whether it has caught it or not.  So no to the cat..."},
{"title": "Escapology", "date": "Saturday 17 October 2009", "text": "Yes - the hamster is on the loose. Sammy the Syrian hamster made his escape last weekend - we noticed that the cage was empty on Monday evening, but the girls had each \"seen\" a flash of something in the kitchen on Saturday and Sunday, so we presume that he escaped sometime on Saturday. Luckily for him, I had been lax about getting the mouse traps out although I had said to the FH that the things they had seen may have been mice that the cat might have brought in; it stupidly never entered my head to check the hamster cage.He's still here, but we haven't caught him yet... all suggestions welcome!"},
{"title": "Health update", "date": "Friday 16 October 2009", "text": "I am plodding around the house, doing what needs to be done but a bit slower than usual.  The YFG is full of beans and at school.  The EFG came home from school yesterday with a headache and feeling nauseous, so she has stayed home today - again.  I am getting concerned about the amount of illness she is having this year.  And the FH - he went to the doctor yesterday and got some antibiotics as he has the chesty cold now and is suffering particularly badly.  He spent most of the night coughing, so he will be staying in bed for today.  He is tucked in with plenty of covers, and frequent hot drinks, so he'll mend in a couple of days, I hope.The girls are off to the NIA in Birmingham with my sister to a Disney on Ice performance - they are quite excited!  Just hoping that with enought rest today, the EFG will be well enough to go.Bubblegum gave birth to her babies (she's a rabbit) on 1st July this year, so they are getting on a bit now - around three and a half months old.  Each evening, there is a scrabble and a hustle, and the six of them go in for their nightly feed! Poor Bubblegum usually ends up straddling herself over them as they take their fill of her milk.  They are not quite as big as she is, but they are growing fast, and I am surprised that her milk is still flowing - but it is as I can hear it glugging down their throats. She doesn't let them feed for many minutes before she leaps away, but it is a sight to see as they are laying on their backs with their feet patting furiously at her to encourage the let-down of the milk. We must sex them very soon and get them segregated or we will be having some unplanned pregnancies..I am firmly nailing my colours to the mast this year and saying that we do not \"celebrate\" Hallowe'en. I was shocked years ago when my EFG's godmother dressed her up as a ghost and brought her trick or treating around our street when I had thought the EFG was just there for tea and play! When we moved here and made new friends, there was a minor falling out when they knocked at the door in their costumes and I hadn't a sweet in the house to give them, their mother not being too chuffed at my, \"Oh, we don't do Hallowe'en\".  It was awkward.  The next year, I had sweets in the house to give to callers, but we still didn't go out ourselves.  Last year, I wanted to put a sign on the door saying that we didn't welcome trick or treaters, but the FGs thought that would be too \"embarassing\" as a lot of the callers would be their friends. I see Hallowe'en as unBiblical, unChristian and a load of baloney, putting it plainly.  We worship God and I am not interested in encouraging my children to participate in this glorification of evil.  So how do we avoid it?  We don't walk down the aisles selling the paraphernalia in the supermarkets, we don't decorate the house with ghost/pumpkin/spooky hangings, we will be putting that sign up this year - and I will be telling the parents of the friends who might call, that we don't do Hallowe'en.  We're coming out of the Hallowe'en closet, so to speak, and not avoiding the issue."},
{"title": "Getting there, one step at a time", "date": "Tuesday 13 October 2009", "text": "I'm still suffering with this awful cold, but I am making some progress.  After what amounted to four days either on the sofa or actually in bed last week, I made it to the Autumn Show at Peterborough on Sunday.  The Show is the best one that the Showground puts on and really had a good countryside feel with lots of animals/poultry to look at and loads going on.  There was the commercial aspect of all the trade stands, but they weren't as overwhelming as they are in the summer at the country show.  It is close to Harvest, and that helps to get me in the mood, and the glorious weather on the day helped too.I wasn't so lucky with Dad's party on Saturday night.  With the best will in the world, I just could not get up and go.  I spent most of the evening asleep, even though the EFG had brought me her laptop in bed so that I could watch a new DVD.   That's still on the list of things to watch another time.  The FH and the girls had a great time at the party and rolled in at about 11pm.Yesterday I struggled around the house after spending the morning curled up on the sofa watching a Catherine Cookson film, The Rag Nymph, on \"Yesterday\".  I have seen it before - Honeysuckle Weeks plays the lead character as an adult, and her remarkably similar-looking sister Perdita plays the same character as a child.  It's a comforting film, and I read the book too, because like all CC stories, there is a happy ending, after some suffering and a little tradegy.   I managed to wash and hang out three loads of washing during the ad breaks.The girls both went back to school yesterday, and came home full of all the news.  This morning we had a near miss with the EFG's bus as we overslept and woke up at 7.45 - she usually leaves the house at 7.55....but she made it.  She is very good in that she always packs her things the night before so all she had to do was get dressed and go - I made her lunch and she had some toast thrust towards her too!Today, the weather is lovely and I have spent a little time out the back sitting under the verandah in the sun.  It's warmer out there than in the lounge as that room faces north.  I have our bedlinen in the machine now, so I think that tomorrow will be ironing day.  I am going to take the YFG to gym tonight, but probably won't be coaching as I am not up to it.  Delighted to report that one of our coaches, who was widowed earlier this year, has delivered a son on Sunday.  He's 6lb 15oz and fine but she has some health issues so I am keeping everything crossed and praying for her safe recovery."},

I went to the school meeting on Monday, I made it to gym on Tuesday and that was the end of that.  The Book fair had to be cancelled and the apologies sent to the school meeting on Wednesday, and I have had to send my apologies to gym for tonight.  Wednesday was spent on the sofa, yesterday and today largely in bed.  Since the germs have been so widespread as to affect the girls, we have had a Mario Karts tournament on the nintendo DS this morning, sitting on the bed.  The Sudafed started to kick in this afternoon, hence I am up now, albeit still in the PJs!!Grandad's party tomorrow evening will have to be done, or we'd never hear the end of it, so we are planning a restful day and an early night tonight.  Unfortunately, I also have to go to the Autumn Show at Peterborough on Sunday as I can't afford to lose a day's wages, but the girls are quite au fait with running the stall so I am hoping that I can take a big flask and a chair and supervise them from behind the stall!  The FH had his flu jab on Wednesday so I am not expecting him to be well enough to help on Sunday as it always makes him ill - he'll have the sweats, the cough, the runny nose, the aches and pains - the flu! He keeps having the injection year after year in the belief that this reaction to the vaccine is less severe than the \"real\" flu would be if he got it, and I am not going to be responsible for testing that theory!From a financial point of view, being ill is an interesting method of saving money - I stay at home, so I spend much less!  I have had to ask the FH to buy Benylin and Strepsils for us, and that is that.  Four NSDs (No Spend Days) in a row, as far as the Grocery Challenge is concerned.Hope that you are all well, at least!"},

We had a short trip out yesterday in the late afternoon, and she is now the happy owner of a Syrian hamster: the YFG kindly donated her old cage and the EFG was given a £5 voucher for WHSmith from school for being so excellent (!) so I bought that off her and she had the £5 to get her hamster.  He is a monster compared to the Roborovski pair but he is very cute!Got to go to bed now and try to get some rest.  More tomorrow, maybe."},

We bought two this time, because we thought it was better for the hamster to have some company.  They are really small - Roborovski hamsters - the smallest available, we're told. The YFG has named them Tom and Jerry - we don't know for sure that they are boys, so it might really be Thomasina and Geraldine, but the lady in the shop assured me that they are the same sex, whatever they are!  I told her that two was plenty and I would be complaining if more arrived later on... Because they are so small, we have had to put them into a glass tank rather than Hammy's old cage, as they could have possibly got through the bars, or got stuck in between the bars and there was no way we needed any more trauma.  They are a burrowing hamster, so we have given them a good depth of sawdust to go down into, and they seem to be settling in quite well tonight.The weather here has been incredibly windy and we have had a good rain shower this afternoon - the first for weeks - so the seasons are definitely turning.  Having said that, the forecast is for a dry and bright day tomorrow so we can't complain. We haven't gone to the Barn Dance tonight - I was too tired and the EFG has had a bad head cold all day, so there was a distinct lack of enthusiasm for it here.  I think that an early night is in order."},
{"title": "RIP Hammy", "date": "Friday 2 October 2009", "text": "On coming home from gym tonight, the YFG was inconsolable after finding her little hamster dead in his cage.He had food and water in there, so he didn't die of hunger or thirst, and there is no real way of telling what happened.  He was in the food bowl, which is plastic, so the YFG wonders if he fell from the roof of the cage, where he loved to do his acrobatics, and hurt himself on the hard plastic of the bowl.  There is a lot of bedding in the cage where it would have been better to fall, if that is indeed what happened. I think she had had him about a year, so he wasn't that old for a hamster - I would have expected him to have lived maybe another six months to a year.  We are going to make a trip to the pet shop in town after gym tomorrow to see if they have any more little hamsters.I have just done a big shopping \"trip\" on the www.mysupermarket.com website and then had it sent to the cheapest supermarket, after making some savings through their suggested swaps.  No huge surprise that the cheapest one was Tesco, so that is where it is all coming from tomorrow.The theory today is that I have ordered all the tins and jars and cleaning stuff, the UHT milk, the bleach, etc and all the freezable things that I need to get us through the month of meals which I planned last weekend.  There is no bread on the list, no green veg, no Frubes, no crisps, no individual wrapped chocolate biscuits aka Penguin or Breakaway.  There's no chocolate, either!  I hope that this has helped me to avoid temptation!  It is being delivered tomorrow, which is not a cheap day, but I have spent some of the savings on the delivery, and I am sure that the amount I am paying for delivery on a Saturday is far outweighed by the amount I might have given away if I had actually gone and wandered the aisles - I am not strong minded in a supermarket!I didn't really feel that I had time to go and do it myself this week - we have gym tonight and tomorrow morning, then we are going to a Barn Dance tomorrow evening.   I don't shop on Sundays if I can help it then Monday will disappear into a school meeting and band practice, Tuesday is a trip to hospital and gym, Wednesday is a book fair and another school meeting, Thursday - well, I do get a day to myself then, yes - and Friday is gym again and then Grandad's party on Saturday.

It is seriously cold in those freezers (yes, I KNOW it is meant to be, but sorting through it and handling all the frozen things just chills me through!), but I have had a good rummage through both of them and we have got:Strawberries, broccoli, blackberries, runner beans, broad beans, cherries, mixed peppers, asparagus, rhubarb, apple, whole tomatoes, a whole turkey (that's Christmas dinner sorted, then!), pasta sauce in vast quantities (thanks to GTM for that inspiration), three whole chickens and two bags of chicken pieces, rolls, bread, crumpets, hot cross buns, pittas, puff pastry, loaf cakes, mince pies, fruit scones, baguette, HM bread rolls, HM sliced bread, smoked haddock, cinnamon rolls, pears, chicken livers, gammon, bacon, sausages, leftover cooked turkey, pork chops, chipolatas, stewing steak, Quorn mince and chunks, white fish, sausage meat and several portions of cooked mince.  Phew!  Some of these items we have a LOT of - especially runner beans, strawberries and blackberries.I shouldn't need to buy any green veg for a week or two, and there's easily several weeks' worth of meat there too, if we can live with the repetitive nature of the inevitable meals.  We need to eat more of the fruit - either just defrosted or used in recipes. I am planning to shop on Saturday afternoon this week and I am hoping now that it can be a much slimmer shopping list that I am working to when we go round the shop!"},

The babies are now coming up to three weeks old, and getting more adventurous.  There were 6 of them, but we lost one at the weekend; it just got very weak, and although we tried to hand-feed it, it didn't make it.Above: the lovely flowers my little friend next door brought me for my birthday!And this is the beautiful bouquet that my sister delivered on my birthday!  I was spoilt!Don't forget to send your comments in until Sunday for the Hummingbird Bakery Cookbook.  It is a beautiful book, as well as having some truly scrumptious recipes - there are cookies (chocolate, of course, as well as others), sweet and savoury muffins, the most amazing brownies (frosted brownie, raspberry cheesecake brownie), pies of all kinds - pecan, pumpkin, apple, lemon meringue; cheesecakes, cupcakes - and gosh, then there is a section for just \"cakes\" - whatever could be left?!I watched Nigel Slater last night in his \"Simple Suppers\" programme - it is a revelation, really, to many, I'm sure, that you can follow a \"recipe\" which has no amounts, hardly any cooking times, and a lot of choices - you can add this if you like it, but if you prefer that, use it!  It's a good way to allow people the freedom to use an idea but to mold it to their own preferences.  He made me think of the cookbook I am giving away when he made a meringue confection from ice cream layered under meringue, whipped cream and blackberries and he called it an \"indulgence\" - it was, and so are the recipes in the book.  Delightful, nutritionally unnecessary perhaps, but delightful all the same!  Whilst we should all be trying to eat a balanced diet, I am sure that the odd indulgence is good for us..... I'm working hard to make notes as I watch NS's programmes as I won't be buying the book - Tender (about a cook and his veg, I believe) as although I love NS's books, that one is just too big and expensive!  I have been looking at the bank balances this morning and working out why I am just scraping through to the end of the month again without having any savings to put away and I have realised that the cars are the problem again in September.  My poor old car had to have a service and there were a couple of problems to be dealt with so my cheque book bore the brunt of that at nearly £300 - so that is where the savings money went!"},

The growth in the garden is over and all that we have left is the ripening of the last tomatoes on the vines - they will have to be harvested tomorrow.  To bring the autumn feeling right into the house, we have enjoyed a delicious beef stew for supper tonight and the aroma as it cooked was wonderful! I am still processing food for the freezers - another load of pasta sauce has gone in there tonight: I have re-used old plastic hummous tubs for individual portions, as well as the usual Vitalite tubs for more family-sized meal portions.  I am reduced to squeezing these tubs in to the little gaps!  We must eat from the freezers for a week to remove enough food to allow the FH to \"harvest\" the remaining Sasso hens: I cannot afford to keep them through the winter when they are not laying, and I think that they are as meaty as they are going to get, so as soon as there is room to freeze them, their days are up.  I think that there are 8 or 9 of them left (must count them!!) so that is a good few suppers for us!Today was Adam's birthday - he was my friend at primary school until I moved schools when I was nine.  I sat next to him for a year when a \"naughty\" boy had to sit amongst the girls in the class as a punishment and to try to stop him mucking about with the other boys but that meant that a girl had to go and sit in the midst of the boys and that was me!  Adam is just two days younger than me.....haven't seen him since I was nine, but I saw his mother a year ago and apparently he is married with two little girls (a lot littler than mine!) and works in website designs.

My uncle came over for a BBQ - except I couldn't be bothered to fire up the actual BBQ so I cooked it all inside and we got the BBQ atmosphere from eating outside in the beautiful sunshine.  We had pork steaks, chicken thighs and sausages, onion, sweetcorn, tomatoes, rice salad and garlic bread.  A good while later, we had some apple and pear crumble and then we just had to sit for a while in the sunshine!This afternoon, I had just sat down for a snooze when my dad appeared with my birthday card for tomorrow and some photos to show us.  He and MB stayed for a while, and then they nipped off home and we watched some more TV.  The troops had some cheese and tomato sandwiches and ginger cake at about 8pm and then I sent the girlies to bed so that I could watch Doc Martin in peace and they could get themselves ready for school.

I gave them £10 each to choose some birthday gifts for me!!We mooched around the shops and the market at a very leisurely pace, and I picked up some bits and pieces I had been wanting; they spent their money in a flurry of \"Don't look, just stand there!\" and \"I'll be back in a minute!\" which was amusing and touching at the same time.  I do know that there is a manicure set in amongst the gifts as the cashier had to check that I was the responsible adult and paying for the scissors in the set, but apart from that, I can't wait until Monday to find out what they bought!!After the shops, we went down by the river and walked along in the sunshine, eating ice creams and looking at all the beautiful boats moored on the side of the river.  There was the odd one ploughing along the water, but the scene looked so peaceful with the weeping willows and the footpath - it was so relaxing!Then we went to Tesco where the YFG still had £3 left and was desperate to be parted from it!  I was delighted to find Philippa Gregory's new book, The White Queen, on sale for less than £10, as I had picked it up in WHSmith but put it back as it was over £18 in there.  I have bought that for myself and I am looking forward to reading that very soon.  I find that it is always worth buying her books in hardback as I read them time and time again and get something new from each one every time I read it!  I did buy the first ones I read in paperback, but they are looking rather tatty now.  We picked up pizza for tea for the gang, and headed home, via Littleport.At Littleport, the tyre fire I reported on 21st August is STILL burning!  The pyre has died down but the temperature in the middle of the piles of tyres was reported to be about 700 degrees Centigrade at the height of the fire.  Local firefighters are recorded as saying that they hope to have the site completely put out by the middle to end of October!  Some fire......This evening, we have watched Merlin, which frustrates me somewhat: Guinevere (or Gwynhyfr) was a Welsh princess, not a servant girl, and Arthur becomes King in the legend when his father, Uther Pendragon, dies - there is not all this malarky with him and his father together at Camelot.  The FGs pointed out that the BBC altered Robin Hood as well - Marian should not have died, for a start, but then perhaps the BBC likes changing things to make \"good\" television.  Strictly Come Dancing was good and I always like watching the professionals twirling about the floor - shame about a couple of the contenders, though - and the one I wanted out at the end stayed in, last week too!  The YFG's favourite is Anton Du Beke, the FH likes Kristina who partnered John Sargeant last year, and I think Erin Boag is a great dancer!  The EFG doesn't watch.Church in the morning and a BBQ at lunchtime, so hoping the good weather holds on for at least one more day - two would be better!"},

About £110 came from the raffle, with the rest coming from the donations for the cakes and coffee and then a little from a small cake stall we had.  Although we live in a small village, I was very pleased with the turnout of people - a lot of older people came along in little groups to chat over the coffee and have a morning out, and some younger mums popped in straight after dropping the children off at school.  It was a very sociable and enjoyable morning - we'll do it again next September!Flip side of that success is that all I really want to do now is to go to sleep.  There is no gym tonight so at least I don't have to go there and be energetic.  I'm taking advantage of the free couple of hours to get the school uniforms in the wash, and I'm going to throw some baking potatoes in the oven for tea and that will be that for the evening - I shall be putting my feet up and either reading a book or watching Strictly Come Dancing."},

I have hung out the washing, cleared the dining table and covered it in cooling racks in preparation, sorted the chickens and I am just going to nip off for a quick shower and then I will be getting started.  I have sent the FH out for this morning, so that I have a clear space in which to bake!  He will be back at lunchtime, and will be able to come and help me set the tables and chairs out at 3pm.  Tea will be something quite quick and easy and then I think the evening will be spent icing cakes!  I am looking forward to a lie in on Saturday as there is no gym this week...I will be back tomorrow afternoon to let you know how much we raised.  Keep your fingers crossed for me, please, that lots of people will come and the three stalls I have organised to come sell lots so that they can donate lots of commission to the Macmillan fund as well.  Thanks!"},

The EFG is a little worse, but at 13, she coped better than the YFG, who woke up feeling rough and just howled for about half an hour!  They sat on the sofa and watched \"No Reservations\" yet again, and played on their DSs for much of the day, although they did also get their knitting out again!!Both back to school today - YFG has swimming and then her Performing Arts after school club, and EFG had had friends texting her, wondering where she was, so they both felt the urge to get better!"},
{"title": "Highs and lows", "date": "Sunday 20 September 2009", "text": "Several things to report: the hatching is over.   No further black chicks have emerged and so we have turned the incubator off.  Some disappointment there, but you can't help but be entranced by the two that did hatch successfully - they are like little balls of black cotton wool, and quite vocal.The Gold Partridge five are now in their second home as they have been moved out of the lounge and into a more suitable rearing pen in the workshop - I think that they will find it quiet there as they must have got used to the sounds of us talking and music as well as the television.  Hopefully they will get used to the noises of the outside world as well. The older chick, Coco, is still in the house as we can't put him in with them; we tried and they ganged up on him and a swift rescue had to be effected.  He'll be moved as soon as another suitable pen can be constructed.  The two black ones have been moved from the lounge to the utility room: I will be so glad to get rid of the chick smell from the lounge as even though they were cleaned out daily and the window was frequently open, there was an inevitable pong!I have to admit the tragic demise of one of the very first hatchlings from the first incubated clutch of eggs, the Light Sussex.  The five of them were growing well and we needed to move them up to a bigger house and pen, so I prepared the new pen on Thursday and we moved them over on Thursday evening, once it was dark and they had gone to roost.  We have always found this to be the best time to move them as it is easy to pluck them from the perch in the old house, and they can settle in the new house overnight.  They were all put into the new house and the lid put down.  As I walked around the garden, I did hear some loud banging from the house, but I presumed that it was the chickens sorting out who was perching where, and it soon stopped.When I went to let them out on Friday after their first night in their new home, only four emerged.  This didn't worry me as sometimes one is apprehensive about coming out into the new run, so I opened the lid of the house, expecting to be able to shoo it out into the run.  Instead, I found it hanging by its neck from the top of the wall of the house; as I had put the roof down, it must have stretched up and it caught its neck under the roof.  As there is some felt overhanging, and it was dark, I hadn't seen the head.  And the banging I had heard must have been the death throes of the bird.  I was in pieces on Friday morning after finding this - I know that we do kill the birds to eat them, but that is after they have had a suitably good life, and it is a swift and merciful death.  That poor chicken should not have died like that, and it was a terrible accident, but I still feel impossibly sad that it happened that way.Saturday saw us at gym, working hard, and then relaxing a little in the afternoon.  An unexpected phone call at 5pm about today's church service soon had me busy, though - there was no preacher available for our service this morning, so we had to have a DIY service; I have mentioned this before.  However, last time we had this arrangement, our service was very basic - hymns, readings and prayers, and it lasted barely 20 minutes, compared to the normal hour-long service.  So, given the chance to pad it out this time, I worked until 1am to prepare a service which would last as close to the hour as I could make it.  The YFG and I worked on a Bible Bingo game until she went to bed and then I finished it up, and I spend some time on Methodist websites, gathering resources and ideas.  All in all, the service did last the allotted hour, and it was well received by the congregation so I was very relieved, and pleased that it had been acceptable.  It was my first time leading the worship, so I was nervous!Today is my uncle's 70th birthday - Happy Birthday to You! - and he popped over this afternoon on his way to my sister's house.  Once again, he didn't come empty-handed, so we have fruit and veg to sort out tomorrow but we were able to give him some gifts: a new shirt and jumper, and some Ferrero Rocher chocolates. School uniforms to iron now, so I had better get busy.  Good night all!"},
{"title": "Lavenders saga", "date": "Thursday 17 September 2009", "text": "We waited the extra day but the FH opened them tonight - of the twelve eggs (pure Lavenders and split-gene Lavenders) only one had been fertile and had developed into a chick but it seems to have started pipping at the wrong side of the egg and couldn't get out.  There was a tiny tiny crack on the underside of the egg.  So, whatever went wrong this time, went wrong before the eggs got here as nothing had developed at all in 11 of the eggs.  Shame as they were the \"expensive\" ones, too.The two Black chicks are spending a lot of time sleeping - so sweet - and they are slowly finding their feet.  No sign of any further mates for them from their clutch of eggs....Terribly tired tonight, so will leave it there.  Must be some other news to tell you that is non-chick related, so perhaps I'll be able to think of something more interesting tomorrow!"},
{"title": "Blacks are hatching tonight", "date": "Wednesday 16 September 2009", "text": "The cracks have developed and now I have come home from the school meeting to find two wee chicks, staggering around the incubator on very wobbly legs.  They are black with a white/cream patch on their undersides, and they are so sweet!  I am relieved that something has hatched from this batch as I was beginning to despair.  There may be more out of the eggs overnight, as there are a further 10 eggs in there.  Fingers crossed!The school meeting went well - but we are desperately short of members.  We are supposed to have 15 governors but we only have seven!  It means that those of us who are there have to do quite a bit as all the jobs still have to be covered.  Several incidental meetings have gone into the diary already.Off now to scurry the girls up to bed.  Waves to those up north and those overseas!"},
{"title": "There's a crack happening!!!!!!!", "date": "Wednesday 16 September 2009", "text": "Unfortunately, it is not in the Lavender eggs but in one of the Black Orpington eggs which were due today or tomorrow - so this one is beginning bang on schedule.....will open the Lavenders tonight, I think, as three days overdue is long enough for a hen's egg to go, surely.I had tonight's supper cooked by 10am this morning - cottage pie, cooked to perfection, now resides in the fridge, ready to be reheated in portions later.  We have a bit of a dash as we have to pick up the YFG from school at 3pm, get to one town to pick up the EFG at 3.20pm and then head off to the other town for a dentist's appointment at 4.10pm.  In the first town, I also need to pick up some medication from the doctor's for the kids, and then I have a little bit of shopping to do in the other town after we have had our check-ups.  Then there is a school board meeting at 6.30pm so you can see why supper had to be quick!  Tonight there are 21 items on the agenda so it may go on a little, I fear."},
{"title": "Still waiting...", "date": "Tuesday 15 September 2009", "text": "There is not even a suggestion of a crack in any of the Lavender eggs - yet.  Perhaps I am kidding myself but I am going to leave them until tomorrow before I do anything like opening any of them to see what has happened.  To say that I am disappointed is an understatement as I was really looking forward to this hatch.  Having an unusual colour was going to be exciting, and it was going to be really interesting to breed from them when they were old enough, next year.  Older and wiser people may have said that this was too late in the season, but the successful hatch of the Gold Partridge chicks means that that is not always the case.  It's a mystery why they haven't hatched, but I am no great detective and it seems that we just have to keep having a go!The weather has turned distinctly autumnal here now - some crisp, sunny days and some cloudy ones.  Today looks like a cloudy one!  The YFG has her first school swimming lesson of the year today, and has gone off on her bike looking rather like a snail as she has a huge rucksack on her back with all her usual stuff as well as the swimming kit.  I am very proud of her, going to school on her own; she was so shy and timid as a small child that I never thought she would have the confidence to do things like this but I believe that gymnastics has brought her out of herself and done wonders for her confidence.  She scared me on Friday night as she literally flew over the vault - she has developed such flight in her handspring vaults that she is in the air longer than I am comfortable with!!I'm doing OK with the grocery budget - keeping to a menu plan based around what I already have and making a shopping list to just buy what is needed to pad it out means that I am spending less than £40 each week.  The \"Spend £40 and get £4 off\" vouchers from Sainsbury's are doing the trick - I have used three and have three left.  There is space in the freezers for the first time in ages as we are using stuff faster than we are putting things in there for a change.  I did make two pots of tomato pasta sauce yesterday, but we are having one of them with meatballs and spaghetti for tea tonight so that won't take up room.It made me think yesterday about making the best use of our food pounds and of the food itself.  The FH suggested clearing up the tomatoes and picking all the green tomatoes to make chutney but I thought about it for a minute or three and realised that I would rather make pasta sauce from ripe tomatoes than use the green ones for chutney - why?  Well, chutney is a condiment, something you put on the side of the plate and we honestly have enough of that anyway.  On the other hand, pasta sauce is a meal when added to a plate of cooked pasta (cheap as chips!) and maybe with a tiny sprinkling of cheese.  So making the pasta sauce provides the family with several very cheap but healthy meals, whereas the chutney is a nice addition to the cupboard but not really a necessity.   If it comes to the point where the tomatoes are not ripening any more, then I will consider the chutney suggestion."},
{"title": "Sad news to report", "date": "Sunday 13 September 2009", "text": "One of the Gold Partridge Orpington chicks which hatched on Thursday has died.It was noticed on Friday when we did the bum inspection that it had a protuberance near its bottom which seemed to be some sort of hernia we thought.  We inspect daily for pasted vents, and this one was OK in that department, but had this lump in the area.  It was fine in itself and eating and drinking with the others.  Unfortunately, it must have gone downhill overnight last night, as it was found lying on its back, rather damp, near the water saucer this morning. We immediately removed it from the box with the others as they have no compassion and were walking all over it.  Putting it back into the incubator to dry out and warm up seemed to be the best plan, and we gave it water from a syringe at half-hourly intervals to try to keep it hydrated.  It wasn't enough to keep it alive though, and it passed away within the last hour.  The YFG has just tenderly wrapped it up in some kitchen paper and buried it in the garden.The other five are all hale and hearty at this point and we are praying for no further calamities.The Lavenders are due to hatch sometime very soon although there are no signs of anything happening in that incubator just yet.  Watch this space!"},
{"title": "All's well", "date": "Friday 11 September 2009", "text": "Just a note to say that the hatchlings are doing well: eating, drinking, cheeping, sleeping - it's a hard life...there is another hatch of Orpingtons due on Sunday, although these are going to be a different colour - Lavender and lavender/Black.  The Lavender/Black ones will actually be black but some of them will carry the Lavender gene and will pass it on to their progeny, should they have any.  It's all a bit complicated, but quite exciting.Got to go to bed now as absolutely tired out from gymnastics today!"},
{"title": "Cheeky chaps here", "date": "Thursday 10 September 2009", "text": "The eggs began to show some cracks on Tuesday night and by Wednesday morning, there was a chick hatched already.  I kept my fingers crossed that it would soon have some friends!By 9pm last night, there were two chicks, and then by 11pm, there were two more!  Overnight two further chicks hatched and so this morning, all six had made it out.  We are thrilled - this is our very first 100% hatch - and so late in the season, it is even more special.  Whatever went wrong last time, it didn't affect this hatch.  What a blessing!We left them in the incubator until 10am so that they could dry out and start to get fluffed up, but the last two out were still a little damp when we transferred them to their new home.For the first few days, we are using this fetching green mat to stop their legs splaying - it is slightly bumpy and means that they can get a good grip - and it is a good job that it is washable!They have had a drink and something to eat and have spent this evening flaked out with their little heads on the floor, fast asleep.  Coco is mystified as he can hear them but not see them!"},
{"title": "And still it comes...", "date": "Tuesday 8 September 2009", "text": "Today has been a busy but productive day.  I got the jam labelled up and put away, the pears are syruped and in the freezer, and the crumble was made and eaten!  I picked some more of my tomatoes this morning and they were very swiftly transformed into the pasta sauce, and tucked away into the fit-to-burst freezer.  I had to clean the cooker after the jam boiled over yesterday and boy, did that take some scrubbing!?!  Then I relaxed with a book and a cup of tea for half an hour.This afternoon was the return to gymnastics after the summer holiday - and some of the girls are as stiff as boards after seven weeks off!  It will take a week or two but they will get back to normal quite soon.  And then, as we were clearing up, the HC said, \"I've got some stuff in the boot of my car for you,\" and when I went to get it - well, harvest all over again - runner beans, dwarf beans, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, a marrow and a squash, and more rhubarb.  At least some of it will keep without being processed immediately, but the beans will have to be sorted tomorrow.  The potatoes are a variety called Picasso - and they are amazingly good - and huge!  I want to try to grow some here ourselves next year.  They make the most delicious baked potatoes and roasties imaginable. Disaster struck again this morning when Coco's light went out!  Thank goodness that we are having some very mild and muggy weather here at the moment so that he can survive until more lamps get here tomorrow.  Sourcing them locally, the one that failed cost me £6.99 and I can't find any cheaper than that, so I put a call in to a Smallholding supply company in Wales and they will do me next-day delivery - thanks be! - and so there will be 5 here tomorrow costing £3.95 each, less 5% for buying five.  Coco is actually beginning to get feathers on his wings - I must take some more photos tomorrow to show how much he has grown."},

The FH stoned the plums and peeled the apples, so I cooked the apples up and had 5 tubs to put in the freezer, and there are another 7 jars of plum jam to go on the shelf - this time it is Monarch jam.  The tomatoes made 2 tubs of GTM's pasta sauce - an onion went in this time, no courgettes and less garlic, so it is a slight variation.  There are some cooked plums in the fridge to be made into a crumble tomorrow, and there are also some peeled pears which I will make a syrup for and then they can also be frozen.  Then I made a chicken pie for supper with the leftovers from last night and it all made a mountain of washing up!!!!Apart from all that, D has been round for a chat and I gave her some plums (well, I did have 14lbs!) and three loads of washing have been done.  There's a little ironing needing doing and then I can collapse in a heap with \"Goodbye, Jimmy Choos\" by Annie Sanders, and a cup of tea.....bliss!AND - I think that the Indian Summer has arrived!  We are forecast a week of warm, dry and settled weather - hurray!!"},
{"title": "Poultry auction today", "date": "Sunday 6 September 2009", "text": "The poultry auction was at Holywell Row, near Mildenhall in Suffolk.   There is a weekly sale at the same venue but this was a quarterly auction of pure-breed poultry, as well as pigeons, waterfowl, quail, parrots, and some equipment and hatching eggs.  No, I didn't buy anything!!  There were hundreds of entries and the auction went on and on and on - there were two auctioneers, Fabian Eagle and his brother (I'm told) both selling as fast as they could draw breath.  The prices were good, I think, and I particularly wanted to see what the Buff Orpingtons went for - a pair sold for £46, and then a pen of three hens went for about the same, so it seems to depend on the birds as well as demand.  It was a very interesting day out, and the FH and I enjoyed it, but the girls were bored with the waiting and watching.....On the way home, we stopped at a roadside stall and picked up some beautiful veggies - bunches of new carrots at 50p each and cabbages as big as footballs, also for 50p each.  I got two bunches of carrots and a cabbage, and I am really looking forward to eating those carrots - they are the best!  They smell wonderful - fresh and earthy like a good carrot should. This evening we have had Uncle J over to tea and he has brought his bounty again to share with us - Monarch plums, runner beans, blackberries, pears, tomatoes, cooking apples and some more Laxton Fortune eating apples.  The harvest just keeps going - but the freezers are full!  I jokingly said to the FH that we would need a third one and he said that I should find other ways of preserving the food........mmmmm...apple butter might be a good way for the apples as that has been very well received; the beans will get eaten in the next day or two, the tomatoes can be eaten and some more pasta sauce made as I should be able to squeeze a pot of that in somewhere but that leaves the plums!  I can't make more jam, I just can't!!  Plum crumble will be on the menu, and maybe stewed plums for breakfast too.  I am just so grateful to be given it all that I shouldn't complain at all."},
{"title": "Another Saturday", "date": "Saturday 5 September 2009", "text": "This was our last \"home\" Saturday for a while as the YFG and I will be back at gymnastics next week, so I made the most of it.  Four loads of washing were blown about in the wind and sun and have been ironed this evening; the chicken which was killed yesterday has been cooked and partially eaten; the older Light Sussex hens have been promoted to the laying pen; we found a \"lost\" broody bantam - she was in hiding with nine eggs - we have re-located her to a safe place, and will see what we can do about getting her some fertile eggs. The YFG has spent the day playing with her friend, and the EFG has done some homework and been helpful.  Tonight we have all sat and watched \"Australia\" on DVD - and it is a seriously good film.  The girls enjoyed it - and I am pleased to say that there is only one single incidence of the F word in the whole film - Hugh Jackman says, \"Crikey\" quite a lot, though!  He's rather nice to watch too!  The Aboriginal background to the film is very interesting.We are going out tomorrow to an auction of pure breed poultry near Mildenhall, not to buy but to observe!  It should be interesting and I must remember to take my camera to take some photos of breeds which I may be interested in, in the future.  I'll get it out now."},
{"title": "A Challenging Day", "date": "Friday 4 September 2009", "text": "The weather was the first thing - it has just been so very windy here all day - even the water coming out of the watering can got blown off course!  I pottered at home until about 12 and then I went into town to do some shopping, pick up some contact lenses, get a prescription for the EFG and go to the bank, the dump and the petrol station.  I had all of that done by 2pm and came home for some lunch; I made some hummus yesterday and it was quite garlicky, shall we say!?!  I had that for lunch and successfully kept the vampires away for the rest of the day.I had an email conversation today with my sister and booked the caravan at Kelling Heath for three nights in the October half-term, and simultaneously booked Uncle J to come here and look after all the creatures for me.  That is something to look forward to at the end of October - and to save up a little spending money for as well!  There is a good bookshop in Holt which I like to visit and the most excellent jigsaw shop in Sheringham too - and there is Sheringham market where we like to have a poke around the stalls on a Saturday morning. This afternoon, the FH killed a chicken on my instructions: she has been attacking me every time I go into the run to feed them for about the last week.  She always goes for the piece of my leg immediately above my left knee and the whole area is like a dot-to-dot with peck shaped bruises.  I will not have an aggressive hen in the flock and so she had to go.  I cannot have any chicken attacking me or anyone else, so I really had no choice, and it was about time we had another one in the pot anyway, so her behaviour sealed her fate as the next candidate!The EFG was also on the receiving end of some challenging behaviour on the bus on the way home from school today, so we had a long talk when she got home about how she can deal with the bullies if it happens again.  It boils down to jealousy in the long run, I am sure - she got a Principal's Commendation in Assembly this morning for her voluntary work on a committee in the school, and she works very hard at school, and I know that the teachers think highly of her.  Working hard and doing your best isn't terribly highly regarded in some circles, unfortunately, so I am  doing all I can to let her know that I am immensely proud of her, and love her to bits!My shopping trip was my personal challenge.  I have my £4 off a £40 shop vouchers from Sainsbury's and I wanted to spend no more than the £40 necessary to get the £4 off.  I made a meal plan based around what we have in the cupboards and freezers, then made a list of all the other things I needed to buy - mostly fruit and veg with the odd other bits and pieces.  The whole lot came to £42, so it was £38 after the voucher - and the actual food spend was only £36 as it included some more cider vinegar for the poultry, which comes from a separate budget.  54 chickens have to have an allowance all to themselves!!The shortbread I made last night was declared \"Delicious!\" and it has all gone - already!  I did make it with butter as opposed to margerine, and so I bought some more butter today in order to make more, but I think that I will leave it until tomorrow evening to make it, or it will never last until Monday morning."},

I made an effort not to even turn the computer on until the late afternoon most days, which worked well.They went back to their respective schools today - EFG into Year 9 and YFG into Year 6!  YFG says it is \"weird\" to be one of the oldest in the school, but good.  She also has a brand-new-to-the-school teacher this year - she had one of those in Y4 and got on very well but that teacher left after only a year to have a baby and then moved away.  I hope that this teacher is good and fair.I have joined the \"Grocery Challenge\" at www.moneysavingexpert.com  which can be found here although I am using a different username there!  It is worth a look even if you don't want to join in because there is a whole list of budget-busting recipes and meal ideas in the first couple of posts.   It is amazing to read how little some people spend on their groceries each week and month, and it can be very inspiring - there are also some fab ideas on that thread, so do have a quick peek when you have a minute.Coco is still thriving.  The next eggs are not due to hatch until next weekend so there will be an age gap of nearly two weeks between him and them.  Fingers crossed that more hatch next time.Weather is atrocious here - wild, wet and windy.  The poor chooks are having their feathers ruffled severely in all this wind. I have made some shortbread and flapjacks for the lunchboxes tonight, so I have to go and see if they are cool enough to put in the tins........."},

I was pleased at how much of the food we or our friends and relatives had produced.Scarmbled egg (from our girls) was on the list for breakfast, served with wholemeal rolls from the freezer, courtesy of Mr Hovis via Sainsbury's reduced shelf.Lunch was another risotto but one quite different from the one before as the veggies were changed: onions we were given and runner beans, courgette and tomatoes from our garden, with the addition of the rice and stock from the cupboard.  We followed that up with some home-made lemon madeira cake.Tonight's meal was home-made macaroni cheese with some grilled bacon chopped and put in the pan with it (almost out of date bacon needed using up!), served with next-door's baby tomatoes and some cucumber, and another bread roll.  We didn't need pudding then and there so we had some apple crumble (neighbour up the road's trees) a little later on.It has been as local a day's food as I could do today - I could have made it a little better if I had grown the cucumber, but ours are finished now, and I could have made the bread rolls, but although there were some home-made bread rolls in the freezer, they hadn't had wholemeal for a while and I thought that the change would be nice for them.   We have also munched our way through a few mandarin oranges between us, which are obviously not grown locally, but all in all, I'm pleased with today and hope I can do something similar again tomorrow; I know that there is another apple crumble on the menu as I made two!!Introducing Coco, the newly-hatched chick-in-residence!Coco has made it through a couple of nights under the lamp, and has been seen to be eating and drinking, and even preening, so we are hopeful that he will make it.  We have called him Coco because he is a lovely chocolate-brown colour at the moment - you might not be able to see that clearly from the photo as he is under a red lamp so that has distorted the colours a little.  Should Coco turn out to be female, all the better!Today has been an \"at-home\" day and I have loved it.  The girls have been playing together as all their friends are busy/out and so they have covered the lounge floor with a train set and some Playmobil and had tremendous fun together.  We have done some Professor Layton puzzles together on the Nintendo DS, and I have been gardening!  I have dug over most of one of the raised beds where the chickens have manured it for me, so I have been digging that in.  I also pulled up the pumpkin plants and harvested the pumpkins - there are four or five small (really small!!) ones and two decent sized ones.  I'll be looking out for some pumpkin recipes soon.For exercise, I have sent the girls out to go \"round the block\" ten times on their bikes on two occasions today as they were spending a lot of time on their bottoms!  The second time the YFG went on her skates and got lapped by the EFG on her bike - no wonder, really.  The YFG really flies along on her skates and looks so graceful.  I must admit to having my heart in my mouth watching her though, as she goes at such a pace I am sure she'd hurt something if she crashed!The chickens are laying 3 or 4 eggs a day at the moment, and I have introduced a new supplement called Poultry Spice into their diet as a short term measure whilst they are moulting.  I hope it helps them as some of them are looking extremely bedraggled.......poor things!"},

A quick foray on the internet seems to suggest that the fault may be something to do with humidity, but that is beyond my control in so basic an incubator - all I can do is put in a small pot of water as instructed and leave them to it.  I have successfully hatched the 5 Light Sussex which are growing well in the garden now, so I am not sure what went wrong this time.We are also a little worried about the chick as it will be an \"only\" chick and we have never had one of these before!Now that I have two empty incubators, I am going to move the eggs from the automatic one into those two as the auto one is not holding the temperature steady, and it is the expensive eggs in there as well! Chicks aside, there was a Christening at church this morning so the church was unusually full!  It was a nice service, even if it was apparent that 99% of the Christening visitors rarely stepped inside a church.  The baby didn't enjoy the process much, but he soon calmed down afterwards, and his elder sister watched the proceedings with a certain look on her face as if to say, \"Rather you than me!\""},

{"title": "A day of waiting......and waiting!", "date": "Saturday 29 August 2009", "text": "The chick is still alone as none of his \"siblings-to-be\" have hatched out yet.And a disaster has struck: the lamp we use to keep the chicks warm has broken, so we had a little problem there.  This chick really needed to be taken out of the incubator tonight and given food and water, but without the lamp, we were stumped - until I thought of using the spare incubator!  He is now in there, with the temperature a little lower and with some food and water.  It will have to do temporarily overnight until we can obtain another lamp tomorrow.  He seems to be a healthy and sturdy little chap (I am presuming male for the sake of not calling the chick an \"it\") and I hope he goes on well.The YFG has been out for the day with her friend M from gymnastics whose birthday it is today.  They and three more little girls have been to the \"snozone\" at Milton Keynes to do some ice-sliding: apparently, they sat on big rubber rings and went down a sort of bobsleigh run/channel.  Sounds hairy to me, but her face was a happy one when she popped in on her way back to M's house.  I had had a text to ask if she could go for a sleepover with M tonight, so I agreed and they called in on their way home to pick up her PJs and toothbrush!  I'll retrieve her at some point tomorrow morning.The FH crept out of bed in the early hours (well, it was early to me, but it may have been 6ish) and came back to say that we have one hatchling!He said it was black, so I presumed it to be a Cuckoo Maran, but on looking myself and noting the position of the egg in the incubator, it is in fact a Gold Laced Orpington, so I guess it will lighten up a little as it dries and then as it grows.It is exhausted from its struggle to get out of the egg, so it is just lying there most of the time, as its plumage is drying out from the egg.  How exciting, though, to have one hatched, and still the hope of more to come today and perhaps even into tomorrow.  Can't take photos in the incubator as I mustn't take the lid off or the humidity will drop...."},
{"title": "Cracks?", "date": "Friday 28 August 2009", "text": "No, not a one, yet!  Disappointing, but there's always tomorrow.....Just cooking the risotto for supper - red peppers from the greenhouse, courgette from the garden, onion from a friend's allotment and garlic from Sainsbury - along with the rice, and veg stock; it smells good already.  I have decided to serve the chicken cold on the side rather than incorporating it into the risotto as there isn't a lot of it and that way I will have more portion control.  There was more chicken last night, but it seems to have been picked at a little over the course of the day!I saw the Economy Gastronomy book in Sainsbury's today for £12.99 so I spent £10 of my nectar rewards on it (well, towards it!) and got it.  I have had a look through it over a cup of tea and there are a lot of good ideas in there - and more than just recipes: how to stock a larder, items you shouldn't really buy (like ready made mash), how to shop efficiently, etc - the sorts of things that they are trying to cover in the programme but in more depth.  There isn't a lot that is new to me in that, but I think it would be useful for people who hadn't been brought up to do that sort of thing.  The recipes are the attraction for me, and there are some interesting ones in there which I shall be trying.  Not this weekend, though, as I have lent it out already to my friend and neighbour D to peruse over the weekend.  She accepted it with some joy this evening so I think she was pleased with my offer.My bargain of the day (I'll take a photo when I have washed it all) is a dinner service from a charity shop.  We have needed some new plates and dishes for some time as ours are getting chipped badly, so when I saw this all for £20 I bought it: 4 mugs, 8 large dishes and 2 smaller ones, 9 side plates and 9 dinner plates.  I was pleased with that find, but it took some hauling back to the car!I also made these (bread rolls) today, and put half in the freezer.  If you try them, please bear in mind that the recipe says to let them rise for 15 minutes once you have shaped them into rolls - it just isn't long enough!  I left them for nearly three hours whilst we were out, and they have come up as lovely, light rolls which the family adore.  I also made 16 instead of 12 and they are a good size.  A recommended recipe.I am hoping that the weather bucks up for the Bank Holiday weekend as today has been very \"sunshine and showers\" and there was a spell at about 5pm when it became very blustery and cold.  We can do without that kind of thing in August, thank you very much!  However, I have got my fingers crossed for some kind of an Indian summer once the kids are back at school - a sunny September would be lovely.We have 6 Gold Laced Orpington eggs and 6 Cuckoo Maran eggs all due to hatch today, so I have been peeking through the window of the incubator at regular intervals but alas, there is nothing, not even a crack, to report yet.Last night's sleepover went OK, although the YFG woke me at 3.15am to say that she was hungry, so I think I told her to get a biscuit or something, and then she went away!  When I came downstairs this morning, they were all still asleep - and it was nearly 9am by the time I had showered and surfaced properly as I felt the need to stay awake on patrol until 1am as they were being a bit silly last night!FH and I watched \"Australia\" on the EFG's laptop in bed, and it was a good film, but it was longer than we thought.  Each time something happened to make us think that a good conclusion had been reached, another drama eclipsed that one and it went on.  It lasts a good two and a half hours, I think, and we had to have the subtitles on as the FH couldn't hear it very well (you can't make the laptop as loud as he likes the TV!) but I would definitely watch it again."},
{"title": "Quiet day at last", "date": "Thursday 27 August 2009", "text": "The kids played, I pootled around, chatted with a couple of neighbours, popped out to the local surgery, cooked, and now I am off to watch \"Australia\" on DVD with the FH whilst the kids and their two friends who are here for a sleepover are watching something a little scary downstairs.I watched \"Economy Gastronomy\" last night for the first time.  The meal plan for the week was based around a whole salmon, in an attempt to reduce the family's weekly spend from £410 to £260.  Granted that there are Mum, Dad and five kids, but that still seems like a lot of money.  Anyway, some of the recipes looked good, and it inspired my neighbour D to come and borrow a large flat dish in which to make the treacle tart from last night's show.Today's food here has been a little in that vein: last night's slow cooked chicken was delicious and yielded so much meat that the chicken pie was made for tonight's supper and there is still enough left for a chicken risotto tomorrow!  The leftover veggies from last night were resurrected with the help of an onion, some garlic and some eggs and a very respectable frittata-like creation emerged for lunch today."},

Now, 4 eggs from 25 chickens is not great, but it is a huge improvement on one!!"},
{"title": "Seeds for next season already", "date": "Wednesday 26 August 2009", "text": "Yes, it's the annual Wyevale Garden Centre's 50p a packet seed sale.  I learned about it last year, and really stocked up, so I was looking for it this year.  It started last week, so I was worried that there wouldn't be a big selection left today, so I called ahead to the Centre at Crowland near Peterborough which is our nearest.  The phone operator said it was OK and they had some left - well, I needn't have concerned myself as most of the hanging hooks were still fully stocked.  I was really surprised as I thought that more people were into growing their own veggies and that it would be a popular shop this week - maybe people don't know?!?We bought cress, courgettes, lettuce, parsley, peppers, several kinds of tomatoes, cucumbers, kale, broad beans, dwarf French beans and runner beans, multiple packets of some of these too!  All told, there were 33 packets which cost me £16.50 but they had a RRP of £67.98 so we saved just over £50 - what a result!  Shame of it was that if we had gone yesterday, the FH would have got his OAP's 10% off and saved me another £1.65 but I suppose that would be being greedy, really :-)"},
{"title": "\"To see if I could do what my grandmother did\"", "date": "Tuesday 25 August 2009", "text": "I have lifted that quote directly from Rhonda Jean's blog here because it reminded me so much of the correlations between the life I am trying to live and the one she had that I know of - there are years and years of my grandmother's life that I know nothing about!My grandmother was a marvellous old woman when I knew her - I was born when she was 69 so by the time I was old enough to remember her, she was already an \"old\" woman; she took a nap every afternoon between 1 and 2.30pm, and then it took her nearly half an hour to get washed, put on an afternoon dress and come downstairs for afternoon tea at three.  Her life was full of ritual and routine.  Breakfast at 9, making beds, preparing a hot lunch every day for 12 noon, her rest, her afternoon tea, and eventually retiring to bed again at about 9pm.  She moved at her own speed and seemed to get a lot done in her own time.  I know that she had a thrombosis in her leg which gave her some pain and made her walk with a stick so she was limited when we went out and about, and she frequently would sit in the car and look at the sea whilst we went for a walk on the beach.My grandfather is a shadowy figure, dead before I was born, and so I know only what others tell me of him.  He fought in the First World War, he had something to do with the first Arsenal football team when he played football, he was considerably older than my grandmother... and that's really about it.  My grandmother owned a row of cottages, an orchard and some pigs and poultry which lived in the orchard, and I am sure worked very hard looking after them.  She sold the orchard land at some point in the sixties and used the money to buy land in the same village in south Cambridgeshire on which she planned to have two houses built for her two sons.  The younger son didn't go for that plan, and some of the land was sold off.  The remaining land forms a very large garden where my Uncle J gardens to this day.  He and Granny moved in there sometime about 1962, and he has lived there ever since.  She lived there until her death in 2002, just less than a month short of her 99th birthday - as sharp as ever, her body was failing her but her mind was very clear.So, I don't think that I can do what my grandmother did, as I can't have pigs here, and I envy anyone who has an orchard - but I am doing my little bit.  I made my last batch of plum jam tonight, thinking of her again.  I can do the \"make do and mend\" that she practised, although I haven't got to the keeping of the button box yet.  The chickens are definitely an interest that has come from her, and she was a good plain cook.  She used rags for cleaning as I do, but she used beeswax polish on her good wooden furniture once a month whereas mine is more damp dusted and left at that!  Recycling and composting were second-nature to her, and growing your own fruit and veg was just the done thing as far as she was concerned - she rarely bought anything like that, just as Uncle J rarely does even now.  She shopped in an old-fashioned way right up until the late 1990s; she would send a list to the village shop on a Thursday by my uncle, and then he would go back on the Saturday to pick up a small cardboard box containing their groceries for the week.  It was really only the things like flour, sugar, tea bags and loo roll, for example.  My mother always bought their meat from our local butcher and we took it over on our weekly Saturday afternoon visit.It was a different way of life, but one that we would do well to learn from, and one that I can easily learn about as Uncle J keeps up many of her traditions and ways of doing things.I have set the 12 Black Orpington eggs tonight in desperation as the third incubator still has not arrived; I have had to squeeze nine eggs in alongside the Gold Partridge Orpington eggs and three in with the Lavenders in the automatic incubator.  It is temporary but I didn't dare leave them any longer.Today we have also been to Downham Market to the shoe shop; it is time to buy school shoes again!  For an inordinately large sum of money, we came home with two pairs of black shoes - the styles this year are all very plain, but with feet like my two have got, we were over the moon to have got some - the lady fitting them said she felt like she had won a prize when she found a pair to fit the EFG.  It took 45 minutes to fit them both and we were still there 15 minutes after closing time!  I cannot recommend the ladies at Smith's Footwear highly enough - they came close to sainthood for their patience and excellent attitude today.I have been thinking about worming the chickens for a long time now, but we have never wormed them before, and my grandmother didn't believe in using pills and potions on anything, so I have no experience of it.  I have looked at adverts in the various magazines like \"Grow Your Own\" and heard of a raft of worming and tonic-like potions for the chickens.  Then I browsed a forum and found a post from a Yorkshireman who sounds entirely down-to-earth and old fashioned (Granny would have approved of him, I feel!) and he says to forget all those special commercial preparations, and just put cider vinegar in their drinking water every day and it will do wonders for their health, worms and all.  So I liked the sound of that - vinegar has amazing properties and I am very willing to give it a go, so I picked up three bottles of it today; one to go in the cupboard, one for the utility room where I fill the watering can for the arks on the lawn and one to be put down by the tap near the workshop where I fill the bell-waterer for the layers.  They have all had their first dose this afternoon, and they obviously don't mind a weak solution of vinegar or object to the taste as they all continued to drink.  Perhaps they don't taste!?!As for the hatching, today is Day 18 for the first lot of eggs, the Cuckoo Maran and the Gold Laced Orpingtons so the eggs are not turned after today.  Another egg cup of water is introduced to the incubator to increase the humidity slightly, and we just have to keep our fingers crossed now."},
{"title": "The Gardener's Kitchen", "date": "Monday 24 August 2009", "text": "My kitchen has become a resting place for a lot of local produce in the last couple of days.  After the chap with the cabbage opened the floodgates, it has been a steady stream of produce coming our way, from the tomatoes from the family next door, to my uncle turning up out of the blue on Sunday evening laden down with hedgerow blackberries, Victoria plums, runner beans, cooking apples and tomatoes.  Some of the apples were actually eating apples, so I didn't have to do anything to them immediately.  A quick question, \"What sort are they?\" brought forth a very pleasing answer: \"Ellison's Orange, Laxton Fortune and Worcesters - a bit of a mixture.\" I was so pleased to learn that Uncle J has some really old kinds of apple trees in the garden and not just the more standard types that we find everyday in the supermarket - I am always delighted to find the first Egremont Russets on sale, and eagerly look forward to those every year.  Alas he doesn't grow them.  My own apple trees are only in their first year here, and have barely settled in - there are Braeburn and Jonagold trees in the mini orchard which I bought, with pears, Victoria plums and a cherry tree as well.  None of the others have got any fruit on now, although the pear trees had some tiny fruits which soon dropped off.I set to last night and made all the tomatoes into pasta sauce, one lot with courgettes and some without.  That was all blitzed, chilled, labelled and frozen.  I also strung the beans, blanched and froze them last night.  The blackberries are wonderful - Uncle J's house adjoins a field, so he had seen all these blackberries hanging there and no one interested in them, so he went through the hedge at the bottom of the garden and harvested them: \"Well, it seemed a shame to let them go to waste,\" he said - absolutely.  Well over 4lbs of them are now tucked away in the freezer.That left the apples and the plums.  The FH has peeled and cut the apples this evening and I have cooked them, so there will be about 4 bags of cooked apple to go in the freezer in the morning, when it has cooled down.  The plums are the biggest challenge; I reckon there are about 15lbs of them.  The FH stoned them for me, and I have had the job today of sourcing more jars to make more jam.  I thought about it more this time, and didn't go to the hardware store for the jars, but to Sainsbury's, where I bought 6 jars of Basics Curry Sauce at 10p a jar and three jars of lemon curd at 30p a jar.  9 jars bought for £1.50 - and contents as well - bargain.  The curry sauce wasn't as bad as I imagined it would be, so I made a chicken curry, with the addition of a courgette and an onion, in the Remoska.  That didn't quite need all the sauce so I have to admit that the rest went down the drain.....sorry!  And the lemon curd, well, I have used one and a half jars to make two lemon madeira cakes which have just come out of the oven and smell divine.  The only remaining problem is that all that accounts for only just over half of the plums, so I reckon I am going to have to think about it all again tomorrow!  A plum crumble could use some of them, but not 7lbs.  There isn't room in the freezer for many, so I will be looking for other uses; there is a recipe in the River Cottage Preserves book for a chutney which uses plums, but that would still need JARS!!!!!!!!!!  I am never going to throw (or allow the FH to throw) another jar away, ever.Have to say that I have dealt with the plum jam, the madeira cakes, the apples and the curry since 9pm tonight, as it has been too hot today to be making all this heat in the kitchen during the day.  Flip side of that is that I am still here, waiting for the curry to cool before I go to bed.All this garden produce is a blessing but growing it is only half the art - the other is knowing how to preserve it all to make the best use of it throughout the year, and I feel like I am on a steep learning curve here.Just realised that this blog is just a year old as I started it on the EFG's birthday last year.........amazing to me that I have kept it up, and that there are actually people reading it apart from me!  It is lovely to get comments from people and it is incredibly humbling to think that they are reading my ramblings.  Thanks, everyone....."},

Two pens were amalgamated into one here so there was some pecking order sorting out to be done this morning.This is one of the gorgeous Light Sussex which hatched on 1st July.  They are all well and healthy and I am rather proud of them as our first incubated hatchlings!My bargain of the week!  We went to a car boot sale after church this morning and I noticed a heap of rather drab looking cloth and realised that there was an absolutely gorgeous quilt hiding there.  All piled up, it looked nothing, but washed and out on the line, you can see how lovely they are - yes, there were two so perfect for the FGs to have one each.  And they were only £5 each - they are easily worth many times that!A closer shot to show the detail.The spiced Apple butter from yesterday - one jar has been given away and the rest safely in storage.This is the incubator we have borrowed.  We turned it on last night and it easily got to temperature by this afternoon so we have loaded it up with a dozen eggs and are praying hard that it works.  It is automatically turning the eggs as they are on dowels which are connected somehow to a motor which rolls them this way and that.They say that what goes around, comes around.......I took a small jar of the apple butter up to the older gentleman who gave me the apples, to share with him and his wife what I had made from his apples, and he gave me two cabbages!  When I walked home with them, I re-gifted one of them to my neighbour who loves cabbage and who has been sharing his cherry tomatoes with us...I had already been given a cabbage on Friday evening so didn't need two more, so I was pleased to know someone who would appreciate one.  Truly a community garden around here!"},
{"title": "Butter and babes", "date": "Saturday 22 August 2009", "text": "I was given some apples the day before yesterday and have been struggling to know what to do with them as we already have too many bags of cooked apple in the freezer.  I came across a recipe for Spiced Apple Butter at this great website, so I made it this afternoon.  Picture of the finished product to follow.  A similar recipe is also in the River Cottage Preserves Handbook.  I have to say that it was a lot of work; the apples have to be cooked in quarters without being peeled or cored as the recipe says that you need the pectin found in the peel and core to help the butter to set...mmm, well, the trouble is then that once they are pulped, you have to sieve it all to get the bits out.  I think that it was worth it, as I have got about 8 jars of varying sizes of this lovely stuff, but my wrist aches rather from the sieving!The FH has borrowed another incubator from the editor of the Smallholder magazine who lives locally, as we weren't going to get all the eggs in ours.  It is an automatic one so there'll be no turning necessary.  I'm going to plug it in tonight and make sure it reaches the right temperature before we set the eggs."},

She's going into Y9 at school this year as well, and will be doing the first of her GCSEs this year - she's getting so grown up. We have had a lovely day today celebrating; she was up and opening her gifts at 7am, pottering with the YFG and her friend from up the road in the morning after she decorated her cake, and then we went out after an early lunch to go to the cinema for her birthday treat. After picking her friend, S, up, we got to the cinema a little late to see Bandslam, but I think that they were already going off that idea in the car anyway - so we ended up seeing \"Ice Age 3\" which was an animated film - a good one.The friend stayed for pizza and cake before we took her home again, we popped in to see my sister in the same town, and called round to see the Head Coach from gym who had some allotment produce for us: runner beans, rhubarb, courgettes, onions, potatoes and a cabbage. Some of that will get eaten at the weekend, and some of it will have to go into the freezer. Being given all this lovely food makes me really feel that we are going into autumn now - the harvest is being gathered in; the slightly dusty smell of the combine harvesters in the fields around us and the balers ejecting the round bales onto the fields - we love to watch the bales magically appear! I'm not so keen on meeting the combines in the narrower roads round here, but the drivers are usually accommodating and move over....Tonight there has been a massive plume of smoke visible on the horizon for hours and it has been on the news tonight that a tyre shredding plant has gone up in flames at Littleport which has worried the YFG. She remembers the Australian and Californian bush fires and was worried that the fire could spread over here - I had to explain that this fire was under control and that we are lucky that there is a big river beween us and Littleport which would stop the fire, should the fire service lose control. The EFG solemnly pointed out that all that smoke wasn't doing the ozone layer any favours, as we could see it throughout the evening.I succumbed to the ebay temptation and bought some eggs on Wednesday evening - they arrived this afternoon by Special Delivery. Trouble is that I had to buy another incubator to put them in. End of poultry purchases for this year - totally! I bought some Black Orpington eggs (a dozen), half a dozen pure Lavender Orpingtons and half a dozen split Black Orpingtons ie carrying the Lavender gene. I'll explain that another night! They are all \"resting\" after coming through the post today, so they will get set in the incubators tomorrow or Saturday nights - I have to calculate the availability of the brooder space, so I need to make sure I can cope with all the potential hatchings."},

MB kindly cooked me some delicious salmon - it was wild Alaskan salmon portion with a slightly smoky flavour from Waitrose.  I shall have to look to see whether Tesco or Sainsbury has anything similar as it was much nicer than the salmon I usually buy.  I had that with some salad.After that, we left the FH to enjoy a rest and watch TV with dad whilst we went to see my friend B.  The girls came too, and played with her sons on their wii - we don't have one so they like to play on them when they get a chance.  It was wonderful to see them all again, and she made me some delicious flapjack as well (thanks, B!) and we caught up on all our news over a cuppa whilst the children played.Had to be home soon after 5 to turn the eggs in the incubators, so we had to make a quick trip into the Co-op to pick up a lemon, and then we were home.  Now I have the EFG's birthday cake in the oven and washing up to do.

I bought 6 Gold Partridge Orpington eggs at the weekend, which arrived yesterday and are going into the incubator tonight, and since I am going to have to run the second incubator, well, it might as well be full, mightn't it?  So I am looking for another half dozen to go in there with them.....had my eye on some Lavender Orpingtons last night, but missed them by a pound; there are three more lots on there tonight, so I will be trying to get some of those, without going over my self-imposed limit!We are also going to put the three older Buff Orpingtons into the Autumn Show at the East of England showground on 11th October - we've never shown any before but these look so lovely that I thought I'd have a go - they won't win anything as I haven't a clue how to present them for showing but hopefully we'll learn from the experience and find out more on the day.  There are sure to be lots of people around who will be happy to tell us what to do.The YFG had her friend H round to sleep over again last night - it was more successful this time, and they slept in the motorhome in the garden.  We all got up late this morning and have had a general pottering day.  FH's cousin and his cousin's wife have been here this afternoon and evening, bringing the birthday gifts for the girls, and we have been making plans for the EFG's birthday on Friday: I have to make the cake tomorrow so that she can ice it, and we are taking her friend S to the cinema on Friday afternoon.Tomorrow we are going to see my dad and have lunch with him, and then go and catch up with a friend who lives in the same town who I haven't seen for about a year - shamefully!  She has been busy and I have been too, and our lives have drifted apart from the way we used to be, but we are both excited about getting together for the afternoon tomorrow.  Might even have to bake a cake to take along - must get up earlier tomorrow with all this baking to get done.And last night, I had to buy eggs!  My girls are all (well, nearly all) taking a break from laying; they managed three between them today and that just isn't enough.  Thankfully, Sainsbury's have some very reasonable free range eggs so we bought some of those.  I'll be glad when the newer hens start to come into lay!"},
{"title": "Sunday special", "date": "Monday 17 August 2009", "text": "Yesterday just felt like a good day - we got up and were at church for the 9.30am start on time and it was a good service.  We didn't get a minister this week or even a lay preacher - we got \"Worship Team A\".  The week before we had been wondering as a congregation what this team would be like but we were very pleasantly surprised.  It consisted of a minister's wife from a local town, with two helpers - and they worked well together.  The talk was about the parable of the mustard seed and how from something so tiny, something as majestic as a mustard tree (apparently can reach over 15ft tall!) can grow - and we all have that potential within us - it was a very inspiring and motivating talk.  The FGs were asked to do a reading each, and tackled them well with no practise!After returning home and mooching around the garden for a while, we decided that we would take a ride out to Hunstanton in the afternoon, once the eggs in the incubator had been turned.  We left here at about 2.45pm and went off in the general direction of Hunstanton, and got there to find that the front was absolutely heaving and there was nowhere to park the motorhome - I couldn't get it into a couple of the carparks because they have height restrictions.  The FH thought that we might get on better at Wells-next-the-Sea, about 15 miles further along the coast.  That was quite possibly the most challenging 15 mile stretch which I have ever had to take the motorhome through - the roads were quite narrow and twisting and then I had to turn it around completely as we weren't going to get over a very narrow bridge and had to take a detour.....all good fun!  Wells was as bad as Hunstanton, so we gave up and headed back along the coast in the hope that the crowds would have dissipated a little and we might fnid a space somewhere - by the time we got back there, it was nearly 6pm and although there were still a lot of people around, there was a little more space to park and breathe!  The YFG and I queued up at the fish and chip shop for the provisions and then we ate sitting and looking at the sea.Hunstanton is the only east coast seaside resort where the sun actually sets over the sea - in all the others up and down the country, the sun rises over the sea.  Weird fact - it is just because Hunstanton's \"sea\" is The Wash and looking out to sea, you can just make out the Lincolnshire coastline across the water.We collapsed and watched some TV when we got home last night!Today has been another day when we seem to have done a lot: we were up at the crack of dawn (\"sparrow's fart\" as Katie Fforde so eloquently puts it) to get the EFG to the surgery for a blood test, and then we had to go to the newsagent who keeps me a copy of \"Grow Your Own\" each month.  Some new recipes for pickles and jams are in a handy booklet on the front  this month, so I shall have to see if any appeal.My friend B brought her children round for the morning after that, and she did my hair with some highlights (first time ever!) whilst they played and then she cut their hair too - all ready for school!  I made her a cake this afternoon as my part of the bargain and she was very happy."},

Some marmalade too, and some pickle.I have had to re-arrange the utility room to accommodate all this gorgeous jam, but the storage has worked out well and I now have this rack of jam.  Plum at the bottom, in regular jars, then a motley assortment of jars holding the gooseberry jam I made last night, and at the top, four jars of pickle, three of marmalade and a donated jar of strawberry.  This lot should be enough to overwinter us on toast and jam, jam tarts, bakewell-type tarts, coconut tarts, jam roly-poly, mmmmm - and all the other things we can make with jam!I have spent most of today washing, sorting out the utility room and checking through the pantry and finding lots of duplicates which won't need to be on the shopping list for months - five (yes, FIVE!!) jars of peanut butter and another five jars of lemon curd and four jars of bought raspberry jam!  And the three drums of Bird's custard powder - and the three boxes of icing sugar - you could outlive a siege here, I think."},
{"title": "Fairtrade versus British", "date": "Friday 14 August 2009", "text": "I have been buying a lot of sugar lately for all this jam and I have come across a dilemma of sorts.Tesco (definitely) and Sainsbury's (I think) sell British Sugar - made less than 30 miles from here, grown in the local fields and supporting local farmers.  When I sent the FH into a Co-op the other day, as he was in the other town where there is only a Co-op, he did buy the sugar I asked for, but I was dismayed to see that it was cane sugar and had been carted literally half way around the world.Yes, it was Fairtrade sugar, but still....  I do support the Co-op in lots of ways and I think that it is a good, ethical supermarket - and I totally support Fairtrade chocolate, coffee and bananas, for example, things we don't grow here.  But why can't they stock British food if there is a British version???The children and I were only talking yesterday about why I love to grow dwarf beans and why I absolutely refuse to buy green beans from Kenya and sweetcorn from Senegal.  The sugar saga fits right into that conversation - buy British, please!Yesterday was the YFG's tenth birthday - and she made the most of it: she was up and opening presents by 7am, bathed and dressed and out rollerblading round the estate by 8am!  Then she had to stop for a bacon roll, and catch her breath.I made her a madeira cake the night before and then yesterday morning, I put a layer of white roll-out icing over it as a base, and she went to town decorating it.  She really enjoyed doing it and wanted me out of her way!At 12, we picked her friend H up and went to Peterborough to Planet Ice for the ice-skating treat.  H was rather timid on the ice to start with, edging her way round, holding on, but she soon gathered her courage and went out into the middle.  YFG just flew around, and really surprised me.  They had a wonderful time and we stayed right up until the last minute when the rink closed at 4pm - they were almost the only children on the ice at the end and the YFG thought that was amazing - to have the rink almost to themselves was bliss.  YFG thought that we should go more often - she has only been three times in her life, so that wouldn't be difficult!We came home and they played whilst I put the pizza in the oven and then we ate.  The birthday cake was pudding, and then they went on the trampoline, rollerbladed outside and eventually collapsed to watch a DVD sometime later.  H stayed the night, and then they played a lot more today.  This afternoon I took them both to the swimming pool for an hour (free for U16s) whilst I raided Sainsbury's for dishwasher cleaner and more sugar for MORE jam!!"},

There were 8 at birth but 2 didn't make it.  The remaining 6 are all hale and hearty now and enjoying life!This is Sylvie, or Sylvester!  We're not sure yet, but it is probably our favourite from the litter as it has the most attractive grey coat and is a very contented little rabbit when you have a cuddle with it!There are the twins, Chimp and Chomp, an almost black-coloured one, a brownish one, and one black/brown one as well as Sylvie - and that makes 6.  We haven't sexed them yet, so we don't know whether we will be keeping any of them.  We want to keep them all!!! The chopped tomatoes - just cut into quarters and put into a glass oven dishI bashed about 6 cloves of garlic with the rolling pin and split them open, removed the skin and just laid them in the tray.  I sprinkled some dried herbs over the lot, and then splashed some basic olive oil all over.  It smelled good already!All this went into a low oven for about half an hour, and then it came out looking like this - all the juice had come out of the tomatoes and made a glorious sauce.I let it cool a little and then I blitzed it with a hand-held stick blender and it ended up looking like this (above).  This is for the freezer, but the remainder was served with pasta and some tiny strips of bacon, fried off in  a dry pan, and the troops asked for more!!  Must be good.Many thanks to GTM over at A Life Full of Blessings for that recipe - it's one we'll be using again and again!"},

I am also planning to retrieve some gooseberries from the freezer and make those into jam as no-one here actually likes to eat gooseberries much at all!A small amount of plums escaped from the jam pan and made it into a crumble instead, which we have sampled for tea tonight.  I have also been washing - and I should be ironing now but just felt that I had to sit down for five minutes!!We took some lovely photos of the baby rabbits today so I will be able to post them tomorrow - they are really adorable!"},
{"title": "Getting some energy back at last", "date": "Sunday 9 August 2009", "text": "The flu tiredness is beginning to pass, at last.  This weekend I have felt better and had a little more enthusiasm for life.Yesterday the YFG and I went to town to Sainsbury's for some picnic items and then I cooked and baked for several hours to make some goodies to take to the street picnic/barbie which we went to in the afternoon and evening.  It was good fun and there were a lot of neighbours there to catch up with and we had a good time chatting for several hours.  The girls had a great time, playing swingball and rounders with other kids and with some more athletic adults...This morning we went to church - we took along some Hobnob biscuits to share, home made, of course.  They went down well.  The girls and I helped out with the prayers and readings in the service as it was a DIY service, there being no minister or lay preacher available to come to us this morning - it happens occasionally!  We manage quite well.  One of the other mums played the guitar and her children and husband also did prayers and readings too, so we all took part who wanted to; some of the older members of the congregation prefer to leave it to the \"youngsters\" to lead.This afternoon, the EFG went to the cinema with a school friend and her family to celebrate the friend's birthday; they saw Harry Potter and then went to Macdonald's afterwards.  The YFG and I had already seen the film, so we all had a little chat when she got home about what we thought to it.  Mixed reactions.  The YFG played with some neighbourhood children and did some ironing for me this afternoon - at a price!  She's actually jolly good at ironing and folds the laundry up very well.  It was worth £1 for there to be one less basket load when I get to it!This evening we have been spoilt with visitors - my dad and MB came first, and then my Uncle.  It was like the Harvest festival when he arrived with tomatoes, dwarf beans, two kinds of plums and some beetroot.  I gave him half a dozen eggs to take home - I definitely did well out of that exchange.  I feel more plum jam coming on - just got to find some jars!"},
{"title": "Second annual visit to Oxburgh Hall", "date": "Friday 7 August 2009", "text": "We went up onto the roof and I took this photo of the parterre through an arrow slit in one of the towers.  The little tower/folly you can see in the photo is in the garden - one of the owners in years gone by put up a folly when each of his children was born; there are five around the perimeter wall. Oxburgh Hall in some of its glory - it does look more magnificent when the sun is shining on the red bricks, but it was still a lovely afternoon.This view (above) is the picture of the hall as you come from the chapel - one of my favourites.This is the first view of the hall as you arrive - you walk through the orchard and come to another little archway in a redbrick wall and then, wow - there it is in front of you, looking very serene and peaceful with the lovely gardens and the swans on the moat.The girls and I just had an afternoon out there today - it is a very relaxing place to go and wander.  Even though we had seen it before, it was very restorative to go and walk around again.  The house is still being lived in by the original family which had it built in the 1400s, although they have signed it over to the National Trust and just live in one corner tower now.  It is amazing to be able to see the tapestries which Mary, Queen of Scots and Bess of Hardwick worked on, although they are heavily protected and very dimly lit.  We enjoyed the trip and there will no doubt be a return visit - it is only an hour away and a pleasant drive there and back.  And there was no actual spend at the Hall as we are NT members, although the motorhome did demand another little top up of fuel (£20) and the girls spent some of their pocket money in the shop.Aren't they lovely?!?  They came out from the house a little timidly this morning but they are having a good look around their run now and tucking into their pellets for breakfast.  This run is not their permanent house as they will grow to be large fowl, but it is fine for them to start with, whilst they are still growing up.  They are 13 weeks old, so it will be a while before they start to lay for us."},
{"title": "Update on the spending", "date": "Thursday 6 August 2009", "text": "The biggest spend of the day was the £40 on the Light Sussex hens.  They are safely tucked away in their new house tonight, ready to be let out in the morning.  Hopefully they will be happy here.  It is always interesting to meet other chicken breeders and talk with them; this chap has a pen of Silver Laced Wyandotte bantams, just like my pair and it was really lovely to see so many of them together!We put £20 of petrol in the motorhome for today's excursion - I stopped at a petrol station which I have never used before and it was amazing: the chap came out and served us - we just said, \"Twenty pounds worth of unleaded, please\" and he did it all so that the YFG just handed him a £20 note through the window and we were off again.  You don't find service like that any more!There was a little supermarket spend as most Tesco shops in this area do not stock the Free From sausages any longer - but the one at Wisbech does, so I bought 6 packs at £1.99 each.  That will keep me going for about three weeks - I like sausages.....We also went to a discount shop (Else's at Leverington) where the FH stocked up on wood glue, a container for rabbit food and other bits (including a couple of packets of sweets, shhh!) and we were soon relieved of £18. We also picked up the Cuckoo Maran eggs but I had already paid for those via Paypal, thank goodness.  The lady was lovely and showed me around her chicken pens - I learned a lot in a few minutes there and she was really kind.  Fingers crossed for a good hatch.I was watching some auctions for Orpington eggs tonight and was totally shocked to see a clutch of 6 eggs sell for £124.00.  Apparently, chocolate Orpingtons are very rare and I should think so too, as I shouldn't think too many people can afford the eggs at that price.  Never mind thinking twice about bidding, I wouldn't dare as it is such a gamble anyway.  I can't afford to gamble at those kinds of stakes - I don't mind taking a punt at the £6 set of eggs I have got this week but that is a whole other ball game.    Anyway, the incubator is turned on and should be at the right temperature by tomorrow evening so I am hoping to set them then."},

I thought hedgehogs preferred wet cat food, but this one is not fussy.

They are the from the clutch of eggs which should have been Orpingtons but weren't all - you can see we have one Orpington at the front of the picture and then there are two others in here - mystery visitors again.  We have removed two cockerels from this pen for the auction trip today. Apples growing on my dwarf apple trees - Braeburn and Jonagold trees have a couple on a piece.  The plum and pear trees have declined to produce anything this year so we are just keeping our fingers crossed that next year they will fire up production!Pepper plants in the greenhouse.  These are the younger set which the FH bought somewhere.  They need potting up this week and then perhaps they'll get into production mode!The runner beans are going mad!This cucumber plant is a star purchase - the cucumbers are not huge but they taste gorgeous!The older pepper plants have peppers nearly ready for us to pick - looking forward to these.The hybrid girls are still settling in to their new home and yard.  I rotavated the yard for them so that they would have lots of scratching to do to help them settle - there are worms aplenty in there!The other pen of \"Orpington-should-have-beens\" - again, there is one, and the others are Heinz 57s - hopefully we'll be able to work out what they are as they grow up.These are the beautiful Silver laced Wyandotte bantams which were our first hatch of the year.  They are now happily Mr and Mrs and we hope that they will have a long and happy life together with us.  I am hoping that Mrs will go broody next spring and present us with some more little ones! These are the courgette cupcakes (above)This is particularly for silversewer but for anyone who has a glut of courgettes!I will just link to the chocolate recipe as it came straight from someone's recipe site/blog.  The cake works fine, and I just smear a little chocolate spread over each piece to serve it although the picture has cream whipped onto the cake.  The girls and FH like it, so we are keeping the recipe in use here!I did modify it a little - I only used half a cup of oil instead of the full cup; we had a very oily courgette loaf cake recipe years ago and I didn't want to risk repeating that.  I think a full cup might be a bit much - but each to their own: it's going down well here with just the half cup.  Let me know what you think.The courgette cupcake recipe - I don't think I can put that on here properly as it came out of a recipe book.  However, I can tell you to beat 2 eggs with 4oz caster sugar, till light and fluffy.  Then beat in 8oz grated courgette (peel it first so there are no green bits at all in the cakes) and 5oz plain flour, with 2tsp baking powder and a teaspoon vanilla essence (the good stuff if you can).  We made it up as cupcakes in little bun cases and they took about 10-15 minutes to cook but watch them as the high sugar content seems to make them brown quite quickly.  They are sweet!  We cooked them at our normal 180C.  When they were cool, I beat up some vanilla-flavoured buttercream and piped it over the top in swirls.  They were very good!  TOO more-ish for the good of the hips, if you see what I mean - well, you would if you had seen my hips!!Those little cupcakes hide the courgette most admirably - the Head Coach at gym didn't believe me when I told him he had had veggies in his cake at morning tea last week!!"},

We put them all in there together this afternoon at tea time, and they had a little bit of a pecking order discussion amongst themselves over afternoon scratchings!  The Buffs are huge compared to the hybrid girls, but the girls have more sense - they put themselves to bed, but I had to pick the Buffs up one at a time and put them in the henhouse...Must catch some photos of them tomorrow if the weather is half decent!Spending report - have spent £2.70 on a magazine for my \"put my feet up\" time tomorrow whilst everyone is out, and gave the YFG £1 for some sweets as the EFG had a friend here who offered them both some sweets and then didn't give the YFG any, rubbing salt into the wound by giving one to a cat, which turned its nose up at it, sensible creature that it is."},

To be fair, it isn't all the grocery budget that got blown today.  I did go to Tesco but that can come later. First of all, I have bought some more eggs, this time Cuckoo Maran eggs - half a dozen of them for £7.00.  That means that the incubator will be full again when they are all collected in and ready to go, hopefully on Thursday or Friday once I co-ordinate getting them all here.  I have to get some from Littleport and some from near Wisbech. I have also agreed to buy half a dozen 13 week old Light Sussex hens for £40 which I have to collect from near Wisbech too. And there's more - I have tonight fetched 6 hybrid layers from a free-range retirement home just the other side of the Lincolnshire border at Throckenholt - they are about 8-10 months old, and look in good form - they cost me £36. I think I must have flipped my lid completely.Then there was the £44 trip to Tesco for things for people's birthday parties and a packet of donuts that YFG just HAD to have - they were pink and that had a lot to do with it, methinks!"},

Another batch of American Vanilla cupcakes was made this afternoon, along with a chocolate, nut and courgette traybake. I also made an orange and poppyseed loaf (no courgettes there!) which has been well received. The chocolate traybake is very easily iced as they eat the squares by just adding a smear of chocolate spread over the top. The American cupcakes do take a little more effort, but I'll get to them tomorrow.Apart from the baking, I watched a Catherine Cookson film on \"Yesterday\" channel, did three loads of washing which has been hung out and dried and is now folded, cooked fish pie for the troops and am now watching an auction on ebay where I have been bidding for some eggs to hatch in the incubator. I missed a batch this afternoon by just 50p, so I am hoping to get these! They are golden laced Orpingtons, and the birds look absolutely gorgeous! I also have my eye on some cuckoo maran eggs, but I can't bid on too many as the incubator will only hold about 14 eggs. I was going to buy another one so that I have all my early mornings and late nights at the same time over a three week period, but the chap selling them has gone on holiday until next Saturday so I'll just have to wait!Pleased to report a No Spend Day today!"},

Although I shut the door on the one in the greenhouse, the window was open in the roof, and it may have jumped up onto the bench and then made its bid for freedom through the roof vent.  I haven't seen any cats enjoying a supplementary meal today, so I am hoping that there is a small chance that they may survive somewhere in the verdant overgrowth that is my garden at the moment - they could be sheltering under the courgette leaves, in the runner beans, under the woodpile, under the chicken houses; there are lots of places they could be but they are not there when we look!!For this month only, I am going to record every penny spent on this blog.  With several huge bills paid already or due to be paid now, we are really counting the pennies this month!  We have just paid the TV license, the motorhome insurance and six months' tax, the RAC membership, new lights on the Volvo to get it through the MOT (and then it didn't and there's a bigger bill for shock absorbers but we haven't had that bill yet!) and the chicken feed bill.  There's not a lot left........but on the good side, the cupboards are full, the freezer is bulging and the toiletries drawer upstairs is well stocked.  I have just had a top up delivery from Asda (shown above) and so the first spend of the month is recorded at £68.69.  The photo doesn't include some bread, chicken thighs, ice cream, meatballs and fish which I had stashed in the freezer before I took the photo.  I had a voucher for free delivery, by the way.It's not a huge saving, but I decided not to go out to buy a newspaper today - we have usually got one on Saturdays so that we have the TV listings for the week.  We can use the channel guide on Freeview to see what is on when we have time to sit down.  That's at least 40p saved...It's the 1st August, so it is officially \"birthday month\" here - both the girls have their birthdays this month.  EFG turns 13, so she's going to be a teenager, and the YFG will be 10 which means she's into double figures.  Can't believe that - already!  They had it worked out the other day that the YFG would be at secondary school before I turned 40, whereas our neighbour was nearly 40 before she had her son so they think that me being 40 after the YFG gets to secondary is a major achievement.  Just the differences in circumstances.Another piece of good news - my friend's husband who was made redundant has secured a new job and starts work on Monday.  A slight drop in salary but hey, a job!  They are very relieved, and I am so pleased for them both."},

There are four Light Sussex and a mystery guest, who is most welcome but we are not sure what it is yet!The Light Sussex markings are not impressive at the moment - one has far too much black, one has very little and the other two are passable - but we'll have to wait and see what they look like when they get older.  They are lovely little birds at the moment, and quite happy in this little pen.  We have started to turn the light off during the day.Here they all are having a drink together.There is one escapee in the greenhouse, so as soon as I saw it, I shut the door.  It is in there somewhere amongst the bags of compost and empty plantpots, but it is safely in there.  The other two are somewhere else entirely - I just don't know where.  There are just too many places in the garden for them to hide so our chances of finding them before a local cat does are slim, to say the least.  I have warned the neighbour to keep an eye in his garden as there is a quail-sized gap underneath the fence.Gym club is over now for the summer - we had the last session this morning, and then I went to Tesco for a couple of things which I couldn't get on the Asda delivery due tomorrow.  After that, I came home to collapse with a cup of tea and my feet up for an hour.  All the gym clothes went in the wash and are dry already, and the trainers will need to be whitened again before September rolls around.  We go back to gym around the 8th September, although life will be interesting then as the Head Coach is having an op on his shoulder on 13th August, so quite how fit he will be by September, we will have to wait and see.  There are enough other helpers that we should manage, and now that I have made it to Coach, I could actually run a class with some of the Assistant Coaches. The EFG and I have picked another batch of dwarf beans this afternoon and now the FH is topping and tailing them so that they can go in the freezer.  These are yellowish, although they still taste good.  I am currently cooking my supper and then I have yet another courgette cake recipe to try out.  The girls HATE courgette as a vegetable, but it seems to go down OK in cake, so I am hoping to get a couple of batches of cakes and cookies in the freezer ready for packed lunches again. Shoes are the bane of my life here with two girls who have H fitting shoes.  I am dreading the trek around all the shoe shops which we are inevitably going to have to start soon to find them each a pair to go back to school in.  I have found a new (to me) shop in Peterborough which I may have to try, although I really don't want to have to go all that way for shoes.  Needs must sometimes though - they can't go barefoot!"},

I also added his sign to my sidebar!Yes, I managed the coaching at gym yesterday morning, but then I slept for nearly two hours in the afternoon, and still managed to be asleep at the normal time at night.  This morning I watched another DVD with the EFG, and then I have just been pottering around this afternoon - the girls are out playing with their friends, although they had to come in and play board games for a while when the heavens opened earlier.  Much fun is being had out there now that the sun is shining.  They'll be back at tea time!One of our neightbours has some beautiful gold Sebright bantams - and they have managed to hatch four gorgeous little chicks off.  I have just been to visit, and to offer a little advice as this is their very first hatching, and all is going very well.  The chicks are just like tiny balls of black and gold fluff!We made some cupcakes last night from Harry Eastwood's book - they are American Vanilla Cupcakes, with grated courgette and they are lovely!  We made them in smaller than recommended cases, so we got about 30 of them, iced some this morning and put two packages in the freezer uniced.  Well, they are so good that all the iced ones (12) are gone........and you wouldn't really know that they have any veggies in them at all, apart from the odd little sliver of courgette in the occasional cake.  Highly recommended!"},

The grass around the raised beds is going mad and badly needs strimming, the courgettes are in full swing, the runner beans are not running in the right direction and the lettuces have bolted.  All because I have been unable to give it enough attention in the past couple of weeks due to our illnesses.  The chickens are faring better - I must get some photos!I decided on Monday evening that there was just no way that I was going to manage to be at gym for three hours a day all week so I rang and told the Head Coach that I would have to drop back to three alternate days - yesterday, tomorrow and Friday.  Tomorrow I have to drive the motorhome to get there as the Volvo failed the MOT abysmally and is in the garage to get repaired and the FH needs my Astra tomorrow to pick up another couple of OAPs to take them with him to the weekly lunch meeting.  They would never manage the steps up into the motorhome, so I get landed with that.  I'm a little nervous about taking it out on my own, but if I have to do any reversing, I will station a child in the back window to tell me when to stop!!I have been bad this month for buying books - another package arrived today from the Book People with Willie somebody's chocolate recipe book, three novels which were on offer fopr £6 the three, a vegetable growing handbook from the River Cottage series, and a pack of books: Low Cost Living, Proper Hen keeping, and a year in the veg garden.  And, saving the best for last, Harry Eastwood's new book about getting veg into cakes - can't wait to try some!  A way to use courgettes in fancy cupcakes has got to be good!  I bought all of that lot for less than £25 so I was a happy reader today, browsing through that lot.Rest was the order of the day this morning - I sat and watched a DVD with the EFG whilst the YFG was at gym - she still got to go as a friend took her for me as she was taking along her own daughter.  We watched Inside Man with Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer - the EFG thought that Captain Von Trapp would have been \"past it\" by now, as she says, so we were impressed that he was still acting.  This afternoon, I turned 9lbs of plums into jam - and although it hasn't set up terribly well, it does taste good, I am reliably informed.  However, since the FH was super efficient and took a load of glass jars and bottles to the recycling two weeks ago, I had no jam jars at all for the bottling of the jam and have ended up using Kilner jars.  They are the big ones, so each jar should last a couple of weeks!!"},

We have come so far and done so much in the last ten years that we wanted to mark the day with a family lunch, and we raised a glass to the donor and their family - we can never forget their unselfish donation which gave us the gift.  We have no idea of whom donated the heart, male or female, young or older, etc, but their family was probably thinking of them yesterday as we believe that they died on the 25th.  The FH received the heart in the early hours of the 26th.So, this morning, Pete the turkey was wrapped in tinfoil and began cooking at about 11am, whilst I dashed around the house, tidying up and getting veg prepared.  Dad's partner brought some puddings, so that saved me some time, and the meal was served at about 1.45pm.  Then we all sat around and watched a DVD of the highlights of their recent cruise - Cobh, Dublin, Greenland, Iceland and various parts of Norway.  The scenery was superb!I have been thinking about the chickens which we have and have had a look at the Rare Breeds register's website - glad to see that I am doing my bit to support the rare poultry - Buff Orpingtons, Buff Sussex and Light Sussex.  However, I did wonder whether I could diversify into more of the rare breeds, even if I only keep a trio of a couple of them.  The cockerels will be the challenge!  Some of them are being sold as hatching eggs on ebay, so I may think about firing up the incubator again and raising some more.  Quite fancy the Ixworth, for example.The YFG and I are at gymnastics for a week of holiday club, 10 till 1 each day from Monday to Friday.  It's going to be hard work, particularly since I am still not 100% yet, but I will just have to pace myself!  The interesting part of the holiday club is that we have 26 or so children of all ages and abilities in the same class at the same time - boys and girls.  There will be about 4 coaches each day, so we should be able to sort them into some sort of grouping on Monday and keep them in those working groups for the week.  We also have the use of a trampoline for the week, which I think the kids will love, so that will be a little diversion."},
{"title": "Back again", "date": "Friday 24 July 2009", "text": "Hi and sorry for the few days' absence.  The family were away overnight last night, and they were quite concerned as to my being alone here for two whole days - I was relishing the thought and they were worried about what I would find to do with myself....they have no idea.  I do have to say that I had the best night's sleep last night that I have had in ages; I think that as a mother, you feel that you don't sleep quite as deeply as you might as you are constantly on the alert for that \"Mum!\" shout which may happen in the night - the call to deal with a nosebleed or a tummyache.  Knowing that I was alone here last night, I slept much more deeply than normal - and not having the FH in pain with his foot next to me must have helped, too! Anyway, I filled yesterday with pottering about looking after the animals, cooking some meals for myself, picking and freezing the dwarf beans (and there were eight freezer bags full), finishing the ironing which has been glaring at me from its baskets for two weeks, and most satisfyingly, getting it all put away in the airing cupboard.  Trouble is that I did another three loads of washing yesterday evening, ready to hang out today, so the ironing pile will soon be resurrected.I also got a couple of new books in the post yesterday from Amazon - the River Cottage Preserves Handbook - well, I just had to have it, as GTM says that it is wonderful.  I completely agree with her, now that I have had a good look through it, and the Pontack sauce does indeed sound amazing.  Not sure where I will get the ingredients in this area, but I will be investigating the opportunities.  The other package in the parcel was a recipe book for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, which I am trying to see if it can help with my IBS which has been particularly troublesome since the swine flu - almost as if the virus has got lodged in there.  The diet is quite similar in restrictions to the \"original\" days of the Slimming World plan, which I taught many years ago, so it is not that difficult.  Well, I don't think that it is difficult, but I am already living with wheat and dairy exclusions, so to exclude sugar and carbs is not such a big thing - it means living on fruit, veg, meat, fish and honey, at the moment.  The SCD does include a particular kind of yogurt which you make yourself to ferment longer, but I won't be trying that just yet as I haven't had any dairy products in over 14 years, so that might not help matters much.  I think that I may make some veg soup today for lunch, if I can.The tax return and tax credits form are no further forward, so I suppose I had better go and sort the critters out and get started on the day properly so that I can get to that later.  I have treated myself to a bit of a lie in this morning!"},
{"title": "Keeping at it", "date": "Tuesday 21 July 2009", "text": "It is the only way to keep going - a little bit at a time.  The last few days have disappeared in another blur of sleeping and eating, and not an awful lot else.  I am still drained and lifeless, in many ways, and doing only the bare minimum.The chicks which hatched from the Orpington eggs have now got to the fully feathered stage and so the mothers have been put back into the main flock.  Two of the broods have been amalgamated so that there are now two pens of five chicks, instead of a five, a three and a pair.  The mothers understandably squawked their protestations at being removed from their offspring last night, but all of them seem to have settled in again.  The chicks are fine too, and huddle together at night for warmth and company.  The incubator chicks which hatched on the 1st July are now beginning to get their feathers - and they are not all Light Sussex.  One of them is definitely brown, and I am not sure what it is going to turn out to be - it may be a Buff Sussex, but I don't think so at the moment.  Perhaps when it has more feathers, it will be clearer.The baby rabbits born to Bubblegum on 1st July are also doing well.  Six of the eight have survived and are thriving.  They are very cute and get lots of cuddles!The FH is taking the girls to Norwich on Thursday so that the EFG can attend a creative writing course at the university.  They will be staying overnight in the motorhome on a campsite and then she will attend the second day, after which they will come home.  Peace and uninterrupted thoughts for about 44 hours, I think.  Such a shame that the time has had to be set aside to do my tax return and tax credits form.We have been eating our own dwarf/French beans for a couple of days now, and they are very good - lovely straight pods which are very tender.  There are a lot to pick, which I will have to do very soon, but for today I just gathered enough for supper.  Plot to plate in 25 minutes, and less than 15 feet travelled too - can't be better than that.  We also have courgettes, pumpkins, butternut squash and a kind of gourd flourishing in the garden, as well as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers in the greenhouse and tomatoes in the troughs.  We need a bit more sun to ripen them, though, if You are listening up there, God.  Speaking of God, our minister came knocking at the door yesterday to see how we were since we haven't been able to get to church for weeks.  Since I was just napping, he didn't get invited in for a cuppa, which was bad of me, but I was in dire need of a sleep.  It was very kind of him to call round, though."},
{"title": "Moving on", "date": "Friday 17 July 2009", "text": "I've heard and thought about flu enough now, so I think it is time to talk about something else.  Quite what, I don't know, as I haven't been anywhere or done much this week, but GTM has a thought-provoking poster over on her blog (see sidebar - A Life Full of Blessings) which raises a few ideas in my head.The war years are not a time I lived through and I have no first hand knowledge of the fear, deprivation and hardship that people endured.  But I am told that it was a time of great community spirit, of an \"all in this together\" attitude, and a \"we'll get through this\" mentality.  Unfortunately, I think that the increase in prosperity since the war has meant the demise of such British spirit.  We could look to this recession with the same attitude, and help one another along.  There are a few who are doing something along those lines, but I see a lot of people keeping their eyes averted and concentrating on themselves.  It is sad that we can't do things for one another in a more generous spirit.  I am a firm believer of what comes around, goes around; if I give, I will receive when I am in need - and it hasn't let me down.  Giving means that I believe that however little I have, I have enough, and I have something to spare.  I do give - books to the school, outgrown/hardly worn clothes to the little girl around the corner, courgettes to the neighbours, bits and pieces to the charity shops - it nearly broke my heart to take a decent tv to the skip last week because none of the charity shops will accept electrical goods. I have to say that the other thing about the war years and the forties and fifties, is that life seems to have been more simple - less technology, less distractions!!Friday already and I have been out of action most of the week.  I posted on Tuesday that I was feeling OK-ish but I spoke too soon.  I spent Wednesday in bed, a raging 40 degree temperature torturing me for about 5 hours until the combination of paracetamol, ibuprofen and forehead cooling strips eventually brought it down but it was extremely oppressive and I wasn't all there for some of the time - I remember having some very weird thoughts.  Yesterday was a little better, but I spent most of the day in bed again, only getting up to cook some supper, wash up and then plod back to bed.  Today I feel so washed out and tired that I have been down to sort the chickens out and have come back upstairs. The weather today is thundery and the air is very close so that is not helping with the temperature control at all!  I had listened to all the news about this being a \"mild\" illness in the majority of cases - and in terms of being life-threatening, I have not had it badly, I agree, but it is certainly not something I am going to bounce back from in a few days - and an older person might struggle more, I think.The girls are doing OK - the EFG only went to school on Monday, and they have been very good at amusing themselves with a DVD festival, scrapbooking, their baby bunnies, and playing games on the computer and Nintendos.  I feel guilty that they have had to occupy themselves for so long but there is simply nothing that I could or can do about it.  The YFG had one evening playing with the little boy next door - outside, with the frisbee (not sure how that is spelled!!) but otherwise, they have only had their own company and I am pleased with the way that they are coping.The five chicks have been moved this morning from their box in the lounge to a proper place in the shed where they have much more room.  They were becoming a little too noisy to have in the lounge for too much longer - and they were getting smelly as well although I was cleaning them out daily.  They appear to be enjoying the extra space, and I will check on them later to see how they are getting on."},
{"title": "Flu update", "date": "Tuesday 14 July 2009", "text": "The YFG is getting better, but the flu has moved on to me, and to the EFG.  The FH continues to evade it, but he is suffering with a  sprained foot.......I felt rough all day yesterday, generally tired and achy with a sore throat, but then it really came on after supper last night.  I had the shivers and the fever, and went to bed fully clothed with lots of blankets and a hot water bottle at my feet.  I woke up sometime in the early hours, drenched, and had to get up and take everything off.  Now I have the chesty cough, and the fever comes and goes but it is nothing like it was last night. The school is operating with very low numbers of staff and children, as apparently as many as 9 members of staff are off sick and the three KS2 classes which we have here are amalgamated into one for this week.  My neighbour has shown me a notice they have sent home today to say that children should not return to school until the 8th day following the onset of symptoms - that notice should have gone out a couple of weeks ago; there are children who got over the main symptoms within 48 hours and were back in school, still contagious. Dad has phoned this afternoon from Bergen to say that they are on their way home, so the boat will dock on Friday.  They have had a good time.Well, I am plodding on, as a patient as well as a nurse - the FH is in bed, resting his foot as it is agony to walk on, and the FGs are outside, sitting under the gazebo, chatting away.  Fresh air can't hurt, so I am encouraging the odd outside interlude as there are only so many DVDs we can watch in one day.  Saying that, they have done some scrapbooking this morning, and helped to clear the kitchen up from last night, so it is not all bad!"},
{"title": "NHS gets it together", "date": "Sunday 12 July 2009", "text": "The phone call last night came much earlier than anticipated - around 9pm, so I was able to dash off the 15 or so miles to the hospital and fetch the Tamiflu for her.Having said that, I am not that impressed now that I have read the leaflet inside.  The YFG is 10 next month, and weighs about 35kg, but the dose she has been given, according to said leaflet, is for a child weighing less than 15kg.  How many 10 year olds weigh 2.5 stone?  I am not going through the hell of the phone calls again to see why this has been prescribed, so I'll contact our own doctors on Monday.  Hopefully she will have managed to take some by then; it says that it is best tolerated by the stomach if it is taken with food, but she is struggling to eat anything this morning, so we haven't been able to give her a dose yet.  I don't want to add an upset stomach to her list of woes, so I am being a little cautious with it.  I know I have to get a dose into her today, though, so I am wracking my brains to think of something to tempt her with in the food line. On a positive note, she slept through the night until 6am, when a dream about things crashing in the universe woke her up.  She has dozed again for a while until we got up at 8am.  Now she is ensconced on the sofa, in command of the tv remote and cuddled under a duvet.Thanks to GTM for her good wishes - much appreciated.  I have cancelled the week ahead in terms of going places/appointments so that we can concentrate on getting better."},
{"title": "Swine flu", "date": "Saturday 11 July 2009", "text": "The first case to be treated with Tamiflu was reported in the YFG's school on Friday morning, and she and about eight others also have it now.  We are still waiting to be able to get her the medication, and the NHS seems to be in chaos tonight.I called the out-of-hours service this morning, was told that the doctor would call back within the hour and he did so.  We had a chat, I described all the symptoms she is experiencing, and he told me to watch her today and call back tonight if she wasn't better.  She has developed a very chesty cough now and is bringing up phlegm, and has a lot of aches and pains, so I rang back as instructed, at 6.30pm to be told that there is now a 6-7 hour wait for the doctor to call back to speak with you.I asked what to do if I needed more urgent advice, and was told to go to A&E, but when I questioned the lady over that, as I believed that the advice was not to take a patient to the surgery or hospital, she said that she didn't really know what to say as it was changing hourly and they were overwhelmed with calls.  She did say that if the YFG's breathing became distressed, I should call back and she would be re-prioritised.  Mmmm - maybe, but if her breathing became distressed, I think I would be looking for an ambulance with some oxygen on board.  I couldn't be angry with the woman on the phone as obviously this is just too much for them to deal with, but it is very frustrating.  I now have to wait up till 12-1 am for this doctor to call.  She did question me as to whether I wanted to do that, but as I said, if I wait until tomorrow, who knows when I might get to speak with someone??Newsround on CBBC reported today that the first case of someone with SF dying who did not have an underlying medical condition has occurred in Basildon in Essex.  When the YFG heard that, she became convinced that she is going to die.  I told her that she will get better as she is healthy, and fit, but she wanted me to promise her that she is not going to die.  It is heartbreaking.  She feels so ill though, that she can't imagine feeling any worse.  God bless her, please."},

Five years for us is a long time in one place, and now we have got itchy feet....We have long admired a particular house in a nearby town, and we know the couple who own it, as the FH spent some time working with the gentleman a few years back.  And there I was, browsing on rightmove, the property website, being nosy about a neighbour's house, and then I saw that THAT house was up for sale, and I could probably afford it.  I called the FH to come and look at the computer, he called the gentleman and had a chat over things like council tax banding, heating fuel and plumbing, and we have been to view it this morning.  We like it.  A lot."},
{"title": "The chick is still alive", "date": "Friday 3 July 2009", "text": "The last chick that was helped to hatch yesterday is still with us, although perhaps not entirely healthy.  Its feathers have not yet reached the \"fluffy\" stage, and only one eye is open, which is worrying.  It is spending some time on its feet, plodding around the incubator.  It will have to be moved to the brooder box by 5pm this afternoon to start eating and drinking so it has a couple of hours to go yet before it makes that big move.We have had some torrential rainstorms here this lunchtime - the garden needs it, but I didn't really need the extra shower as I delivered a dozen eggs to school for the secretaries!Made falafel for dinner last night with the YFG - we modified the recipe somewhat since it called for several ingredients we didn't have to hand: flat-leafed parsley, cumin and coriander.  My mixture was also a bit dry so I put an egg in and made it a little too wet, so we added more flour!  The missing kick from the cumin and coriander was replaced with some Worcestershire sauce - entirely un-authentic, but the EFG and FH said that they were good.  We didn't have the traditional pittas to serve them in either, so the YFG made oven-baked wedges and a salad.  A very cheap and cheerful tea."},
{"title": "Can we count?", "date": "Thursday 2 July 2009", "text": "You would be forgiven for thinking that we can't count here! We can, but these baby rabbits are sneaky little creatures and they keep hiding under one another - there are actually EIGHT of them.  They were all laying spread out this afternoon and I counted them as a matter of routine, and as I got to \"four\" I realised that there were four more, and oh, my gosh, that makes eight!  This is Bubblegum's third litter, and she only raised two the second time, so I am wondering how she is going to manage eight.  They all have full tummies this afternoon so she is feeding them well, but some are bigger than others so we just have to keep our fingers crossed that they all make it.On the chick front, another started to hatch this afternoon, but the FH and YFG were afraid that it wasn't strong enough to break through the shell and so they \"operated\" on it.  We have returned it to the incubator, where it is still breathing but not doing much else, so I am not holding out huge hopes for it."},

Before I get too excited, all I mean by that is that tonight I have seen that two of the ten eggs are cracked - one has a definite peck-shaped crack, and the other has more of a linear crack - but they are cracking!!!!!  There must be chicks in there........can't wait for morning!I am so chuffed with this, as this is our very first attempt with an incubator.  I was very tempted to pay a fortune for a \"proper\" Brinsea incubator, about £99, until I came across someone on ebay selling these \"home-made\" incubators for £24.99.....yes, £24.99!  It is just a polystyrene box, with a thermostat, a halogen bulb and a tiny fan, into which you pop a thermometer.  It would hold about a dozen hen's eggs, and it is absolutely great for the garden chicken keeper like me. I'll be back with an update tomorrow - and I must sort the camera out!!!"},

It is also school sports day here tomorrow so she will be out in it all again then.  I know one girl in her class who has been reported as having sunstroke/heatstroke on the village grapevine, so we have to be very careful.

We had a good morning, dissecting pellets and trying to identify the bones then moving outside for a tour of the aviaries and drawing the birds.  There was a lively Indian Eagle Owl called Indie and a gorgeous barn owl named Sybil amongst the stars of the show.  There was also a flying display which the children loved especially at the end when those that wanted to got the chance to hold a barn owl on their glove.  The weather was glorious until about 2pm when the heavens opened just as we wanted to load the children back onto the bus.  We all got more than a little damp!After gym last night, the YFG went home with her friend P, to stay the night, so we all had a quiet night here - the FH and I had a glass of wine each and then I watched Hotel Babylon with the EFG.  Can't say I recommend it; she has some interesting TV viewing habits, but last night I was so tired that I just sat and vegetated in front of the TV whilst it was on. This morning has been more showers and very humid weather, so the girls at gymnastics were struggling for fresh air, and we worked them hard so they drank a lot!  The washing hasn't dried today because of the humidity too.Tomorrow morning we are taking part in a village yard sale treasure hunt organised by the WI; we are holding a yard sale here, as are others around the village and the WI are selling treasure maps of all the yard sales, so that potential customers do the rounds and pick up clues to win a prize.  We have been scouting around the house and yard tonight considering what we might sell!The eggs in the incubator are due to hatch on 1st July so tonight is the last turning.......can't wait to see how many hatch, and we are just praying that some chicks do hatch after all this time and effort!"},

The FH made them this morning and then I painted them with Cuprinol this afternoon (and got a bit surnburned in the process)  so they are ready to get the tomatoes planted in them at last.  I would have got that done tonight, but my dad came to visit.  We already have 13 plants out from last weekend's gardening, and I put four tumbling plants into a hanging basket yesterday evening. The peas and bean plants are doing well although the lack of rain means that watering is a major job each day.  Got to keep at it!  I will be able to put some photos up here this weekend as we have unearthed the camera charger, so it is busy tonight charging the battery - there will be photos of the chicks for sure.  Long overdue, too!Tomorrow I am going on a school trip to a bird of prey centre with the YFG's class, and then it will be gym, so there will not be time to check in tomorrow - I'll be back with the piccies at the weekend."},

{"title": "Ups and downs", "date": "Monday 22 June 2009", "text": "I am still on a high from the exam pass yesterday and can't quite believe it, but then I have had two niggly things happen today which have not been so pleasant.  One is a complaint about something I sold on ebay, so I am going to have to refund the person and also refund her postage to send it back, which is the right thing to do but the item was in tip-top condition when it left here so I am interested to see what it looks like when it gets back.  The other thing is me taking offence where none is meant, but it still niggles me:A neighbour on the estate was talking to the FH about tomato plants and where to buy them and me having 50 odd here, I took her three as a gift.  As a surprise thank-you, she brought a cake round yesterday whilst I was out.  The FH, girls and my uncle polished it off over supper last night, and I sent the YFG back with the plate after school this afternoon.  I asked her to say thanks very much for the cake and that \"Dad\" had enjoyed it so could we have the recipe please?  The YFG came back and said that she had said, no, it was a secret family recipe.  To me, that is just plain silly.  I'll give anybody a recipe anytime, as I am happy for them to get the enjoyment out of making something for themselves if they have liked the cake/biscuit or whatever when I have made it for them.  How does sharing the recipe diminish her family's enjoyment in any way?  Does another family eating that cake mean that when they eat it, it tastes any the less delicious?  I am puzzled - if you don't share recipes, help me understand why?The weekend really took the stuffing out of me and I have had two naps today - about four hours sleep in addition to a good night last night.  I am still tired and may have another snooze tomorrow.  I have done a few jobs in the garden in between - planted some tomato plants out in the troughs in the sunniest part of the garden, strimmed round a couple of the raised beds, and pottered in general.  Inside the house, I have still got a little ironing to fix, and there will be washing to do tomorrow as the machine is now fixed - £45 for a nice chap to come and take some coins, hairgrips and nails out of the pipe.......still, I had thought that the pump had failed and that would have been £49 for the part alone, so I shall have to check pockets more thoroughly - lesson learned.One of the rabbits is sick - he seems to have snuffles, which we had a rabbit die from the other year, so we are dosing him with some antibiotic and keeping him inside.  Its highly contagious so we have to be very careful with hygiene between touching him and the other rabbits outside.  He has not gone downhill as fast as the last one which had it, so we are hoping that the meds are helping and that he may make it."},

The YFG is sitting on the kitchen floor doing practice papers for Y6 SATS, although she is only Y5 at the moment.  She is making a few mistakes, but she has the jist of it, and is doing OK so I hope that by the end of Y6, she'll be doing better.  I'm proud of the pair of them.As for me, I am getting the jitters over this exam on Sunday.  I am already an Assistant Coach, and this next exam is to be a Coach.  It is quite a bit harder, and the way that the exams are being re-written this year means that I can't defer the exam until I feel more ready for it, so if I don't do the exam because I don't think I am ready, I will have to do the whole course again, and if I give it a go and fail, well, hey, I'll have to do the whole course again - so I may as well give it a go and just do my best.  If I do pass, well, what a bonus that will be.  I have to say that I am aiming to pass, and I hope I do!!!  I have nothing to lose!  I still have some lesson plans to write for the logbook, so I'm not done yet.  I have sent my apologies for the school board meeting tomorrow night as I really need to be at home, reading up and revising stuff for this. We picked a pound of strawberries yesterday afternoon - and ate them all for tea.  I am so pleased to have our own strawberry patch, and we are loving the fruit - so much nicer fresh off the plant than from a shop somewhere.  The variety is called Cambridge Favourite, I think.  The hens are laying less eggs as more of them are going broody but I just don't have enough coops to put them all in to let them have chicks so they are just going to have to go off the idea smartish.  It means that at the moment, about 24 hens are only producing between 6 and 8 eggs a day which is pathetic, really!The eggs are in the incubator, and I just keep turning them every eight hours, and counting the days on the calendar.  They should hatch at the end of the month so we are quite excited about that.  A man came today to sort out a problem with the oil boiler, and he saw some of the quail eggs in the utility room so we got chatting and it turns out that he has incubators as well - but his biggest one is full of 1300 pheasant eggs which he rears for the local estate's shoot!  1300 puts my measly 10 eggs in the shade!"},
{"title": "Swept away", "date": "Sunday 14 June 2009", "text": "The last few days have literally been swept away - the time has flown past and we have been busy.  The gymnastics exam is now exactly a week away, so I am putting as much time as I can into reading, preparing and worrying!  The garden is also needing a lot of time, as there are strawberries to pick, beans to encourage to grow upwards, sweet peas to pot up and put outside, chicks to watch and feed often, the grass needs mowing, etc.  It goes on.....but I love it all.  Inside the house, I am looking forward to watching some TV tonight (Kingdom because it is filmed in Norfolk, and then Hope Springs, because it is filmed and set in Scotland - both favoured places) whilst I do some ironing.The FH has taken the girls to Wicksteed park in Kettering today for an outing and to give me some peaceful time to work on the gym stuff.  They love Wicksteed and always have a great time there.  The FH and EFG went to church first and the YFG and I packed them all a picnic so they went as soon as church was finished.  The FH was all for missing church and getting there earlier but the EFG has a friend who is moving to Devon this week so she wanted to go to church so that she could say goodbye to her properly. They'll be home for tea by 7pm, so I am cooking a roast for then - it will be cooler by then - we are having another scorching day here today."},
{"title": "Just catching my breath!", "date": "Wednesday 10 June 2009", "text": "Yesterday was just one of those days!  We went up to near Long Sutton to fetch the Light Sussex eggs to put into the incubator, and then we had some other bits and pieces to pick up on the way home.  There is a good shop called \"Else's\" near Wisbech which sells all sorts of things at very reasonable prices - from furniture, mattresses, dining tables etc, through to timber and felt as well as garden items like slate for landscaping, seeds, plant pots, and hose connectors, for example, and then there is a load of other stuff - wallpaper, DIY, kitchen items - there can't be much they don't sell.  Anyway, the FH picked up some lovely lengths of wood, and I spent a little on garden items like wallflower seeds, pea nets, twine, etc and a few freezer boxes for freezing portions of food.  We don't go there often, thank goodness.  We also called in at Tesco on the way home for some icing sugar and squash.  Eventually we got home, grabbed some late lunch, unloaded the car, discovered we had sold something on ebay so packed that and took it to the post office, and then I had to get changed, pick up the YFG and head off to gymnastics.........and then a friend had the cheek to say I looked shattered when I got there.  She wasn't far wrong.Today has been a bit slower, thankfully.  I have pottered in the garden, picked some more lovely strawberries, spent more than a few minutes watching my adorable chicks, been out and sold some books, and then got home to entertain visitors for a few hours.  Tea was leftover from last night, so that wasn't hard to make, and then I have been doing some gym paperwork ready for a meeting with the Head Coach tomorrow.  I have to produce a logbook for this exam, so there is quite a lot to get ready. I have set the eggs in the incubator tonight.  They will be turned three times a day at 10pm, 6am and 2pm.  There are 10 of them in there - unfortunately two of them turned out to be cracked when I looked at them carefully last night and I can't be sure that they weren't cracked by us on the way home.  The chap didn't give us a suitable egg box as he gave us one that only holds 10 eggs, so the lid was open and two were loose in the lid - needless to say, those are the two that are now cracked.  The FH ate those for his breakfast scramble, but they were exceedingly expensive scrambled eggs!"},
{"title": "A bountiful garden is a blessing", "date": "Monday 8 June 2009", "text": "Tonight I have taken delivery of a big carrier bag of potatoes, another holding four cabbages and a large tray holding several pounds (maybe as much as 8 or 10) of strawberries - all from my uncle's garden.  What with the broad beans from our own garden and those cabbages, we're set for greens for this week, and all those strawberries!  Well, some will just get eaten, and some will get frozen for later.  We just can't eat that many all at once, and we don't like strawberry jam for some reason, which maybe that we find it a little too sweet - we do like strawberry and gooseberry together, but I don't have any goosegogs at the moment.  I can still do that later, by defrosting and mixing them together when I do get some of the little green, hairy bullets!!The hens which are laying have settled into producing about a dozen a day, which I can cope with, thank goodness.  We have more cucumbers ripening, more beans coming on, some spring greens of our own which will soon be ready, and there are loads of lettuces to savour - the FH loves a cheese and lettuce sandwich at bedtime - I think that the sedative effect of the lettuce counteracts the cheese and so it doesn't keep him awake.   The runner beans and dwarf beans are also looking a lot better after the soaking the rain gave them last night.The mama hens brought out their babies later this afternoon, when it was warmer, and we have a successful count of 10 - brings our total poultry count to 43 if we include the turkey.  Good job I already have the DEFRA registration as if the next lot of eggs hatch successfully, I will be back over the 50 mark again!!!The three hens who have been patiently sitting on the Orpington eggs have been rewarded with chicks.  One has at least 5, one has two that we have seen and we have seen three with the third hen, so that makes a total of 10 definite hatchlings.  There may be more as we didn't poke around under the hens, so we will have to wait until later today or tomorrow when they bring them out properly to feed and drink in the runs.  There were 24 eggs to begin with, but I know that a few got broken to start with when the hens were settling onto the eggs, so I think we have about a 50% success rate with these.  We are pleased, anyway - 10 more chicks on the \"farm\" is a success in itself. So, in total at the moment, there are the 10 described above, three six-week-old Buff Orpington chicks and the two month-old Silver Wyandotte bantam chicks - who are getting their grown-up plumage now and are so gorgeous!"},
{"title": "Twiddling knobs!", "date": "Saturday 6 June 2009", "text": "The incubator has been running since last night, and I have to keep adjusting the thermostat knob!  I am trying to get the internal temperature to 37 degrees as recommended in the instructions.  You might well ask why I don't turn the dial directly to the mark that says 37?!?  Well, the short answer is that there isn't one.  No, this is a \"cheap and cheerful\" incubator and there is a lack of refinements like that.  However, we have a thermometer in the box and when it hits 37 and stays there, we will have the knob in the right place...the eggs are coming Tuesday so I hope we get there soon!Picked a load of lovely broad beans from the garden late this afternoon, and we had half a pound of strawberries yesterday - we had them for tea last night. Gymnastics this morning - wore the contacts today from 8.45 to about 3.30 so that was good going for me.  They certainly do the trick and save my face from attack, but today the YFG kicked my left hand rather badly; sadly I don't think there's anything I can do about that.  Exactly 2 weeks to go to the exam now and I am getting a little worried!"},
{"title": "Incubator is here", "date": "Thursday 4 June 2009", "text": "Yes, the postman brought the parcel this morning.  We opened it and checked that it was all there, and we have read the instructions.  It is now set up in the spare bedroom, turned on with a thermometer inside it to get it set to the right temperature.  If if holds that temperature, we're in business, so to speak.  I have arranged to get a dozen Light Sussex large fowl eggs on Tuesday next week and we will have a go with them.Today has been a No Spend Day - good!  And I am aiming for many more.  I have already fetched tomorrow's dinner in from the freezer, and I noticed that there is no more bread, so I think I will make some tomorrow, partly inspired by GTM's post about baking bread and partly because I have about 7 bags of bread flour!"},
{"title": "More thoughts", "date": "Wednesday 3 June 2009", "text": "I have been to the shop today to have a look at the fresh veggies and fruit.  Today they had carrots, leeks, potatoes, onions, apples, bananas, peaches, and oranges of some kind.  I bought some carrots for tomorrow's dinner - 4 decent sized ones cost me 39p, so that's not too bad.  The stuff is all loose and you just buy what you want, so that is another good point - there are pros and cons like there are to most things!  I have also been \"shopping\" in the freezer for tomorrow's dinner, some bread and some buns for lunchboxes.  There is definitely a surplus in the freezers so it will be good to run them down a little.  Perhaps this plan can work after all.....This month is a designated storecupboard month in this house.  I wondered whether I could take it a step further and just buy the oddments that we run out of from the village shop - but I don't think I can.  I would be prepared to cope with the increase in prices compared to the supermarkets, for the convenience and lack of other temptation, but the lack of fresh fruit and veggies is going to be our problem.  We eat loads of fruit, especially grapes (easy for lunchboxes), apples and satsumas/clementines.  The shop is OK for picking up the odd few carrots or potatoes, but I think we will struggle with the fruit. The other option is to think about the fruit and maybe change some of our ideas.  When my uncle was here at the weekend, the conversation at the BBQ got round to him buying fruit and veg - and he just doesn't.  When pressed, \"What, never?\" as one of the girls said, he thought that he probably bought a few oranges around Christmastime each year, but that was it.  He eats plenty though - apples, plums, rhubarb, gooseberries, red/blackcurrants, raspberries, pears - all homegrown and preserved by freezing, careful storage of the apples in a cold place, and bottling in the case of the pears - and he is a 69 year old man, and he does it all himself; his bottling is better than mine as his pears are always lovely (we beg for odd jars now and again!) whereas the last lot I did went bad!   He is the same with vegetables - he eats what he grows.   He does have a very much larger garden than ours, with the added benefit of an orchard, established over 40 years ago - my grandmother had that house built in about 1965, and they planted the garden themselves.  This would be the scenario I would like to achieve, but I am realistic in seeing that I don't have the land here to be able to be as self-sufficient as that.  I can move closer towards it, though!  They used to keep chickens too when I was a child, and much of what I know about chickens is what I learned from my grandmother. I can't go to his level of production and live off it all this month - that would be impossible.  What I can do, though, is use the fruit I have in the freezer in different ways, so that we get our fruit allocation for the day without me buying grapes, oranges, etc.  Small hiccup there will be the YFG's inability to eat cooked soft fruits - she just can't.  For her, though, I will manage as I have some tinned pineapple and peaches, which she does like. We'll give it a go and see how we get on.Other exciting news!  Quite a lot actually:  we have bought an incubator from ebay so that we can hatch chicks off when we want to, rather than waiting for a hen to go broody - and we'll try to hatch some quail as well.  Can't wait for that to get here.  Then there are the five rabbits born this morning - the mum is a floppy-eared white rabbit and the dad is a Dutch, so we're hoping they will be well and healthy.  And I have just picked the first cucumber in the greenhouse - it's a plant which will produce a lot of little cucumbers rather than big ones, so it is only about 6inches long - we'll be trying that later.The weather is cooler today so I am hoping that my bean plants will perk up - they have wilted rather in the heat, although they have had copious amounts of water.  Perhaps a couple of cooler days will do the trick - fingers crossed.Better go and hang some washing out."},
{"title": "Happy days", "date": "Monday 1 June 2009", "text": "On Saturday evening, the YFG invited a friend to come and stay for the night, which meant that they were twittering away in their room until quite late!  On Sunday morning, the EFG and the FH went to church whilst I pootled around here and kept an eye on the girls - they were busy on the trampoline in their pjs most of the morning.More gardening, more washing and ironing, the same stuff that I have been doing for days - I just did more.  It is lovely to see the garden full of growing produce and looking so neat and healthy, and the pleasure I get from a heap of beautifully ironed clothes ready to be put away is just plain silly!My uncle came over for a late supper BBQ at 7.30 and we ate outside.  I fired up the BBQ and set the pork slices and sausages alight, but all in all it was a good meal - lettuce from the garden too.Today we have had a bit of a hiccup in that I had to fetch the EFG home from school shortly after 10 this morning - she had had a nosebleed for about 90 minutes so I felt that the best place for her was at home on the sofa, with her feet up, plenty to drink and getting some rest - not charging about a PE field in 25 degree heat.  She had already missed her Spanish exam, so there wasn't a lot to stay for today.  She has been doing some Science workbooks for revision most of the day. After school, the YFG and I went to the optician.  She just had an eye test and I got the all-clear to carry on with the contacts, so I have ordered a pack of 30 pairs (£22) which should be in at the end of the week.  This evening, I have been watering the garden as there has been no rain for days, and there is none forecast over the rest of the working week, so the ground here is very dry and my poor plants are suffering.  I do not liberally hose everywhere, but I fetch the water by the watering- can-ful and apply it directly to the base of the plants - it takes forever, but it is worth it.I must do some work on the gymnastics paperwork tomorrow - even if it means going down and sitting in the motorhome away from all the distractions in the house!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday 30 May 2009", "text": "We have been to the caravan which my sister and uncle own near Sheringham in Norfolk for three nights.  It is cosy and easy to look after - the girls have one bedroom and we have the other, there is a little kitchen area, a sitting area and a dining table set up near the kitchen.  It has all the mod cons you could want, including a freezer and a microwave, and is set in the trees.Here is the YFG all tucked up in bed in the little bedroom - the beds are slightly narrower than normal so they have to lay still!!The site is woodland and heath, and there are miles of walks so here is a typical shot of the path through the woodland - it is so peaceful and quiet there that you can really relax!The caravan we stayed in is on this road in the park, just to the left behind the trees here.  There is an pond here which is in an old gravel pit.  Various members of my family have had caravans on this particular pitch on this site for about 26 years now, so we have seen some changes come and go.  When my sister and I went to the site when we were young, we used to play in the gravel pit, but now it is a lovely conservation pond.  My sister actually had her first birthday at this caravan site, but in a touring caravan rather than a static one!  It is such a lovely place that I can understand people going back year after year.This is the pond.So, we arrived on Tuesday, went to Sheringham on Wednesday, Cromer on Thursday and pootled home yesterday.  There were lots of bike rides and walks in the woods each day, and some shopping.  We also had a couple of meals out, and fish and chips in Cromer from Mary Jane's - highly recommended!Yesterday we arrived home, and found that my uncle had been hard at work in the garden, and he has done wonders - thank goodness for him and his kindness and willingness to come and house sit for us.  Going away as a family is nigh on impossible when we have so many animals and birds which need care all the time.  I think that it has been a pleasant change for him to have a short stay away from home for him too. This morning, I had washing on the line, several times, and the weather has been fantastic so it has all been dried.  I also went to buy canes for my runner beans, which are now planted, and a quick trip to Sainsbury's too.  My uncle is coming back tomorrow evening for a BBQ so we can say thanks for looking after everything so well, so I needed a few provisions for that.   Our lovely next door neighbour invited the girls and I to a girlie lunch at 1pm, so that was a treat - she forced me (ha!) to drink half a bottle of wine, and I staggered home at 4.30pm after she and I sat and put the world to rights for the afternoon."},

Glad to be back home, though!"},

I have planted dwarf beans out, sowed lettuce seeds, watered everywhere and tidied the house in bits, and now I am going to watch \"Britain's Got Talent\" whilst I attack a mountain of ironing.  I have made two lemon cakes this evening, and instead of hens' eggs, I used 15 quail eggs!  They are very orange yolks, so the lemon cakes should come out looking quite rich.  They are on the counter cooling, next to a tongue which I have boiled.  When it is cool, I can take the skin off it and put it in a tin to press it overnight.  The last one we had was delicious, so I hope this one is as good.We are going to the coast tomorrow until Friday, and my uncle is coming to house sit and look after all the animals and poultry.  We'll be leaving at about 10 in the morning, so I am saying Cheerio now, until the end of the week - hope you have a good one!"},
{"title": "How does the garden grow?", "date": "Saturday 23 May 2009", "text": "No bells here, but there were some pretty maids eating lollipops today as the weather has been so warm.  The girls were sitting out on the trampoline and then had a big bouncing session once the lollies had settled. I have had some success with the gardening: I potted up some tomato plants - I now have Tumbling Toms (cherry), Marmande (large), Pomodoro (Italian plum) and Sub Arctic Plenty (normal!) varieties all potted up and growing to the next stage.  In a couple of weeks, I am hoping that they will be sturdy enough to put outside in the troughs in the sun.  I also sowed some more seeds for rosemary, cucumber and cape gooseberry.  They all need to be warmer so they are in a covered seed tray on the kitchen windowsill.  The peas didn't get the string over them yet, and the strawberries haven't been netted yet either, but I did spend another 45 minutes weeding them.I wore the contact lenses for two and a half hours when we got home this afternoon, and getting them out was much easier as I went to Boots and bought a magnifying mirror which stands at just the right height so I could see what I was doing much more easily.  I have three pairs left now, so keeping one for the day of the appointment means that there are just two more occasions on which I can try them this week - possibly Monday and then next weekend.  I want to spread the sessions out a little and not do them all at once.  Being new to this, I am not really sure how long it will take my eyes to get used to it - and I am finding that looking at my face without glasses is taking a lot of getting used to!!We have the week off from gym so I am planning to get a lot of the paperwork done for the exam this week, as well as the lesson plans for the next couple of weeks.So much happens in a few days sometimes. The chicks from the utility room have been rehoused in the workshop in a much bigger pen so that they have more room to move around, and they seem to be enjoying the space.  The transition went smoothly, thank goodness, and the best thing is getting rid of the smell from the utility room - poor things couldn't help it but they did pong, even with fresh shavings daily!The Silver Wyandotte bantam chicks are growing more grey feathers, and looking more gorgeous by the day.  Their mum is very intent on showing them how to scratch for food, so as soon as they get let out each morning, she is tearing up the grass looking for morsels to munch on, but the chicks head straight for the chick crumbs before they go to see what she has found.After school on Wednesday, the EFG and I went to town and fetched our new glasses.  Mine felt rather tight so there was some adjustment to do.  Both of us are very pleased with them, but as we both have a slightly stronger prescription than we had before, it took a few minutes to adjust to seeing more clearly - somehow life got sharper in those few seconds! I went out on Thursday and sold a few books so I earned myself a few pounds, which was as well, as I had taken the EFG to WHSmith after the optician as she is looking for the sequel to a book she read ages ago.  We didn't find that book, but we found a few others!  On Thursday evening, I received a telephone call from one of the other coaches at gym to say that her husband had died that morning.  This was a terrible shock for her, as although we had known that he was terminally ill with cancer, it had been expected that he had some months left.  Our coach has a 6 year old daughter and is about 16 weeks pregnant, so she is in our prayers and thoughts all the time.Friday the EFG had to go to school but the YFG's school was closed for staff training, so she had to come out and about with me.  First was a return visit to the optician to try the contact lenses.  What a palaver - getting them in is OK, but I am not so keen on fishing it out again!  He had me put them in twice, get them out twice and then leave them in for a couple of hours.  I then drove to Peterborough, but took them out after two hours before I drove home.  I'm going to try them for a little longer today, but I only have four pairs to try with, and I have to be wearing a pair when I go back to the optician on the 1st June, so that leaves me three.  I would try them for gym this morning, but we have the air track up this weekend, and it dries the air out in the room terribly - I always get a sore throat - so I know that the lenses would probably be quite uncomfortable quite quickly.This afternoon, after gymnastics, I am hoping that the sunshine we are enjoying right now holds so that I can do some gardening - I have beans to plant out, strawberries to cover with nets, peas to string and tomatoes to pot up.  It's lovely to see things coming on in the garden!"},
{"title": "Tuesday update", "date": "Tuesday 19 May 2009", "text": "It's late and I can't think of anything more inspiring to entitle this post.  Just a couple of things to say:  the Buffs are doing well in the utility room, and the broodies are all sitting tight now and I have got everything crossed that they stay like that!I made the rhubarb pudding last night in the Remoska, and it was very well received.  I cooked the rhubarb off with some honey first and then I put the cobbler topping on - which was interesting - made with flour, sugar, margerine, ground almonds, milk and a drop of vanilla essence.  It smelled lovely, and the FH ate it in two portions, one yesterday and one tonight.  I will be making that again and the substitutions I had to make to the original recipe obviously weren't detrimental.  It was supposed to be rhubarb and strawberries, but in our basic English gardens here, the strawberries won't be ready for about another month, so it is not a combination I can do right now.  If there is still rhubarb in my uncle's garden by the time the strawberries are ready, maybe we'll try them together.  It was also supposed to be served with mascarpone cut with orange juice and sweetened with icing sugar - sounds divine but I hadn't got any mascarpone, and it isn't something I tend to buy.  The FH thought it would be good with custard - man of simple tastes!I spent some time doing some admin this morning and then this afternoon I was working on the log book and lesson plans for the gymnastics coaching exam I am taking in June.  At the gym tonight, I was working with some of the girls I will be taking to the exam, so it was focussed and full-on, so consequently I have come home very tired and with a headache! Tomorrow, the EFG and I are getting our new glasses, so we are looking forward to that trip after school."},
{"title": "Changes in the maternity section", "date": "Monday 18 May 2009", "text": "Two of the broodies are sitting \"tight\" on their eggs, and are no problem.  They each have a pot of water as well as one of corn which they are able to access whenever they want.  The other broody has been less successful.  She didn't settle onto her new eggs in the house we gave her for her confinement, and whenever I let her off the nest for food, she didn't seem very keen to go back onto it.  Luckily, I had another broody hen, a Buff Sussex, so she has been put on the eggs and the unsettled one, a Barnvelder, has been put back into the run with the main flock.  She will have to go off the idea of being broody if she isn't going to do the job properly!  So, all in all, there were 24 eggs under the broodies - there are now about 22, although I haven't been able to count them all, but I know that at least two have been broken.  Fingers crossed that we get about 15-18 to hatch successfully in three weeks' time.The Buff Orpington chicks are fine and happy.  At the moment, they are living in the utility room under the lamp.  They are eating, drinking and sleeping, so that is all I can ask, really!The wanderers are back from their cruise around the Baltic states and Russia today, so we will have to give them a ring tonight and catch up on their news.  I am looking forward to seeing their photos, and may share some if there are any good ones.Gardening outside is on hold at the moment due to the weather.  I have been doing a bit in the greenhouse, but it is too cold, windy and wet to do a lot outside.  Unfortunately, the bad weather doesn't stop the weeds growing, so there will be plenty to do when I do get out there again.  My uncle brought us rhubarb, asparagus, lettuces and radishes last night - I have a recipe for a rhubarb cobbler from the Good Food magazine which I think I will try to adapt.  It calls for several ingredients that I haven't got at home, but I think I can improvise!  I also like the look of the Mennonite girls' pineapple pudding, so I will be adding that to my recipe notebook (see sidebar)."},

Can't do better than that....and the pea sticks in the background marking the lines of Feltham Earlies and Kelvedon Wonder peas - racing to see which makes it through first.The autumn sown broad beans are developing well - looking forward to a nice piece of boiled bacon, new potatoes and broad beans in white sauce.  I know that'll be ready by the end of July as it was the meal I had to put in the bin on the night of 25th July 1999 when the call came to get to the hospital for the transplant - I always think of that night when we have bacon and beans!Tomato plants just potted up and growing on slowly.  I still have more to pot up - maybe tomorrow I'll get around to that!  My uncle is coming to lunch tomorrow so I know the garden will get an inspection.I went to pick up the Orpington eggs today, and had a bit of a palaver getting K to hear me bashing her front door down!  Her lovely Newfoundlands and Retrievers weren't bounding around the garden as she was busy in the back kitchen, frying up some bacon, so no one heard me at the front.  Consequently, the YFG and I nipped into Wisbech to Asda and then came back an hour later.  They heard us that time!  We picked up the eggs, and K asked if we would like these little cuties.  They are Buff Orpington chicks, three weeks hatched, and living under a lamp.Right now, they are in a big plastic box on the kitchen table, waiting for the FH to sort their lamp out, but they are fine and will be rehoused very shortly.  I also have to rehouse the 3 broody mamas tonight, and give them their (hopefully) fertile eggs - and I must remember to mark the calendar for three weeks' time!"},

There was a good trickling of people coming through the doors all morning, and it was generally well supported - and I had a good chat with a couple of friends during the morning.My visit to the optician went well, in that I will be getting a new pair of glasses - at significant expense, unfortunately - but there is an improvement in the clarity of my sight through the new lenses, so the cost is justified.  I am also having new lenses put into my current pair, so that I will have a spare pair.  And I have asked to try contact lenses - just for gymnastics.  The kids have knocked my glasses off just one time too many lately, and it really hurts the bridge of my nose - I have seen stars a couple of times!  So I am going back next Friday morning for another appointment to try them out.  Fingers crossed - but it is going to be \"well weird\" as the EFG put it, to see my face without glasses as I have been wearing them for 22 years!The rain continued this morning, so the garden is looking very well-watered, and there is talk of more to come.  Not sure when I will get the heap of wet washing dry, but that is a small price to pay.  Tomorrow I am going to get the Orpington eggs for the broodies so I am excited about that!"},
{"title": "Grateful for the rain....", "date": "Thursday 14 May 2009", "text": "The rain has been wonderful for the garden, and I will have to get out there as soon as I can to remove all the weeds which are springing up now that they have had a soaking.  It did rain most of the night, and it has been humid today. I have had the \"indoors\" day which I have been needing - ironing, paperwork, packing books, cleaning that bathroom, washing, changing beds, etc - and I am relieved that I have done it for this week.  I'm still struggling with housework, but I am getting better at being more willing to get on with it.  I did have a minor moan at the FH this morning at having to come home from the school board meeting last night to find all the dishes from dinner still piled up in the kitchen as I had thought that he and the girls could at least have put them in the dishwasher if they didn't want to actually wash them.  Anyway, I set to last night and the kitchen was clean before I went to bed - and I love to get up in the morning to a clean and tidy kitchen, so that has become my aim each night, to leave it clean and ready for the morning.I have made some biscuits and chocolate buns for the coffee morning at church tomorrow but I just need to ice the buns in the morning.  I'll be up soon after 6 so there will be plenty of time.  Better head off to bed now, so I can catch some sleep - busy day tomorrow: coffee morning from 9-12, optician at 2pm to discuss contact lenses (kids at gym keep knocking my glasses off and it hurts!) and then gym from 3pm through until about 8 or 8.30pm if I am needed at the boys' class. Must just say that the chicks are now a week old, doing very well - I saw them eat a worm today for the first time (Huge excitement - could just see the poor wee thing thinking, \"This is food - but how do I eat it?!?\") and they are becoming black and grey instead of black and yellow, so I think that that is their \"silver\" feathering coming through.  It is easy to spend half an hour watching them and not notice the time fly past....."},
{"title": "Rain - a good rain", "date": "Wednesday 13 May 2009", "text": "The ground here has been crying out for rain; every time I turned over the soil with my trowel yesterday when I was weeding, a fine mist of soil blew away.  Tonight we are getting a decent, steady rain - and I hope it goes on through the night!Yesterday was such a lovely day that I had to do more gardening! It was windy, as forecast, but the sun was shining and it was glorious. I started off in the greenhouse until the sun really got up, potting up the cucumbers that I bought on Monday, and sowing some sweet pea seeds, and some other bits and bobs. Then I came out and hit the weeds, hard! One whole bed got weeded and readied for planting, and another got tidied up again. That leaves just one bed to be prepared, but there is no rush for that one as the beans are not up yet. I also finished sowing peas straight into the ground - the FH has made me more pea sticks to criss cross over the rows in an attempt to keep the birds off the young seedlings as they emerge.All this gardening is good for the garden, but it hasn't done the house any good as I haven't had the time to keep up with the housework, but I guess I can do that when it rains! I also got two loads of washing dry in the winds yesterday, so there is a little heap of ironing to do as well. Today therefore really needs to be an \"indoor\" day, and reading Rhonda Jean's post about baking this morning has also nudged me into thinking that perhaps I should make some more biscuits for the troops.Going back to the beginning of the month, and my \"no-spending\" month, I have to report that I have unfortunately spent the budget already several times over. We are only at the 13th of the month, but the FH being ill from the 19th April has really hit me hard in the pocket. Naturally, when someone is ill, there are things which need to be purchased that I don't always keep in the house - he wanted lemonade and other drinks which I don't usually keep in the house, then I was told to give him soup, I had to get more cleaning cloths and disinfectants to clean the bathrooms thoroughly on a daily basis (I clean them regularly normally but not daily!) and then there was the problem of me just not having time to do all the things that I would usually do as I was running about up and down looking after him, so there were a few more basic purchases - I haven't made bread for weeks, baking in general has slid to a halt, and I have been more weak-willed with the children's \"asks\" as I have been so tired! Having to nip into the supermarket as the FH has fancied x or y has meant that I have seen z on offer and bought it too - so that hasn't helped! The freezer is jam-packed with meat, I have enough washing detergent for about six months, and we shouldn't need another jar of lemon curd this side of Christmas, so there is hope!I have recognised what was happening, and I am regaining control of the situation! I have made changes in the house to take account of the problems - the FH's constant waking through the night and TV watching were disturbing my sleep, so I have temporarily moved in to the spare room until he feels better, and able to sleep through the night again. That has improved the way I feel during the day, and makes me better able to cope with the work. I have also looked more closely at the things I \"ought\" to be doing in a day - and like this week, I have told myself that the weather dictates that the gardening must be done now, so that is what I have concentrated on, and to hang with the hoovering - it's not going anywhere! And, strangely, I have stopped using the dishwasher as I HATE unloading it. I can't get anyone to do it for me without moaning, so I have reverted to washing up by hand a couple of times a day, and I am enjoying that more.Today I have to do the housework, a bit of baking and some ironing. At some time, I have to process a book order for a local school, hopefully before 3pm. After picking up the YFG at 3, we have to go and get the EFG and get her to the optician's for 4pm, and then there is a school board meeting at 6.30 so tea is going to be a casserole to be eaten in between. After that, knitting will probably be all I want to do!"},
{"title": "Another day in the garden", "date": "Monday 11 May 2009", "text": "Dropped the YFG off at school, came home and checked emails and selling on ebay and then hit the garden.  It has been a lovely day, windy but very sunny, so I have had a productive day in the vegetable patch again.  The runner bean seeds I planted ages ago are not growing, so I have planted another batch, ditto with the french beans.  Also sowed some onions and peas.  At lunchtime, I had a break and went to the nursery again!  Bought two cucumber plants, four strawberry plants to plug the gaps in the strawberry bed, five celery plants, another load of lettuces, some Romanesco cauliflower, and some sage plants.  There were four \"plugs\" of sage, but I have potted them up and made eight plants, as there were a lot of seedlings in each plug.After school, I took the girls to town, for band practice and a shopping trip.  I left them at band and went to Focus, where I needed to buy some plant labels (we don't eat enough lollies here to use the sticks!) and a packet of sweet peas.  I also had to get the YFG a new swimming cossie as she is going to go swimming with the school for about 8 weeks, starting tomorrow.  She's nearly 10 so I got the 10-11 size, but it is too short in the body.  So that will have to go back and hopefully they do some nice ones in 11-12.  Came home, cooked sweet and sour chicken with rice, washed up, shut up all the quail and hens, etc and am just about ready to go to bed!Have finished my first knitted square!!!!!It's probably not a miracle, but it seems wonderful that my dad can call me on his mobile from the deck of the cruise ship in St Petersburg!  It was 11am there, only 8am here, but he thought it would be the best time of day to catch us in.  There was quite a delay on the line, and I was replying to one question as he was asking the next - I suppose that was the sound bouncing off the satellites!  They are having a good time, going to a Cossack evening tonight and then a river trip tomorrow.  The ship returns to Southampton next Monday, so they are half way through their holiday.  Hope they are taking some good photos!"},
{"title": "Plodding along nicely", "date": "Sunday 10 May 2009", "text": "Yes, it has been another steady Sunday, just the kind I like.  The girls slept the night in the tent, until I woke them at 7.45am.  The sun was already getting warm and the promise of a beautiful day was already obvious.  I hung the load of white washing out whilst they were coming round and then we had some breakfast.  They ate sitting outside and really made the most of the outside today.The social evening at church last night was successful, raising £100 for the church funds.  There were some cakes left over so the congregation enjoyed them with tea and coffee this morning.  The attendance at church is improving slowly, and it is lovely to welcome new people into the church.  This morning's service was about the fruit of the vine, and the \"bad\" branches being cut away.  It gave us all plenty to think about.After church, I got changed and started on the garden, weeding, potting up tomatoes and pricking out lettuce plants.  The FH has been pottering a little as much as he feels like, and has been helping a little bit.  The YFG made macaroni cheese from scratch for lunch, and made a good job.  She will happily follow a recipe, and doesn't like too much help!  This afternoon, I continued weeding, planted some broad beans out, and cut the front lawn.  We have had a lovely roast dinner tonight, and I have finished the ironing...and there was a spare half hour to sit and knit too.  It feels like one of those days when I have had a lot to do, and managed it all.  Yet, I plodded through and didn't feel overwhelmed. I have arranged to pick up the Orpington eggs next weekend, so that gives me this week to sort out the accommodation, as some of the houses need cleaning out, and two of them need some slight modifications to the way the doors open.  The chicks are hale and hearty today - I sat and watched them whilst enjoying a cuppa and a rest from the weeding.  It is just so relaxing to just watch them! The YFG went out for the afternoon to play with a neighbour's child; they are both in the same class at school, and enjoy playing together at home too.  Most often they are on our trampoline but today they were in the other girl's garden with her little sister too - it was weird to be able to hear the YFG playing but in another garden - our gardens back on to one another! The EFG will be returning to school again tomorrow.  She had to have Thursday and Friday at home as I had to take her to the Out of hours GP at the hospital on Wedensday night.  She was quite poorly with a high temperature, headache, etc so the doctor diagnosed a flu-like illness and told me to keep her at home until tomorrow.  She is concerned about the amount of work she has to catch up on but I spoke to the welfare lady for her year on Thursday and asked for as much help as possible for her to catch up.  It won't have done her attendance figures any good but she is so rarely ill, and it just can't be helped.  I am hoping that she will be healthy for the rest of the term now!"},
{"title": "Crazy children", "date": "Saturday 9 May 2009", "text": "Usually, my two darling daughters are arguing - they compete for attention and really don't get on terribly well. On occasions, though, they will become close for a couple of days and do things together. Tonight is one such a time - they are keen to spend the night in the garden in the tent! They are out there now, all wrapped up under a mountain of duvets and sleeping bags, with a hot water bottle, playing by the light of a torch. This is not even a \"proper\" tent but a cheap (£5) Tesco two-person tent, recommended for warm summer nights or playing in the garden, not 7 degree spring nights..... I wonder whether they will last the night!The chicks are still both alive, eating and drinking, and tucked up for the night now under Leah. I am pleased that she is turning out to be a good mama so far. I have texted the lady near Wisbech who has the Orpingtons and she has some eggs available for my broody hens to sit on. We will be sorting out some suitable maternity accommodation and ordering some eggs this week. Also delighted to report that the greenfly-like thingies on the tomato plants are gone - I sprayed them with the washing up liquid solution so I presume that it did the business.  Tonight there was a Social Evening at church to raise funds.  We weren't able to actually attend, due to all the other stuff on the agenda, and the FH still being in dubious health.  I did, however, make a chocolate slab cake for the refreshments, and I took a book in as a raffle prize.  I bought a couple of strips of raffle tickets so I hope I don't win my book back!  I do hope that the evening is successful as the church's finances could do with a boost.  We are also holding a coffee morning next week, so there'll be more cakes on the agenda.They've just come in as they have heard \"noises\" in the garden.  Refilled the hot water bottles and gone again.  They are safe in the garden as the big gates are locked and no one actually knows that they are out there - and to be honest, no one will be expecting people to be camping in a back garden in May. Just got a basket of laundry to fold ready to iron tomorrow, a bit of washing up to do and then I am going to knit for half an hour.  I just cast on 50 stitches on Thursday and I am knitting a \"square\" - maybe if I get enough squares, I will be able to make something.  Rhonda Jean has some patterns for squares on her site (Down to Earth) so if I improve, I might try one or two of them.  I did make a cardigan in moss stitch once, and I enjoyed that pattern.Isn't it amazing how you remember things?  I dropped off a birthday present to a dear friend of mine last night, and I wanted to be reminded of her mum's name, as she looks after H's boys and I sometimes speak to her on the phone if I call and H has got a day's teaching somewhere.  It is embarassing to me that I can't ever remember her mum's name.  I knew it was unusual, and pretty, but all I could think of was Guinevere.  So H told me, and I was surprised to find that it is Sabina.  On the way home, the YFG and I were talking and she said that Sabina rhymes with Ribena, so we can call her the Ribena lady and we will instantly recall that her name is Sabina.  Brilliant!  Haven't forgotten it yet..."},
{"title": "Rabbits update", "date": "Friday 8 May 2009", "text": "Here's the younger mama with her two babies - they must be about six weeks or more now (must check the calendar!!) and they are both getting on very well.  They are beautiful rabbits, nicknamed Champagne and Martini although I have no idea why. This is Bubblegum casting a wary eye over me with the camera in her face!  She is a lovely mother and very protective of her offspring. Food is obviously the highlight of their day - they seem to spend a lot of time with their noses in the trough. This is the latest litter which Bubblegum's mother, Rosie, gave birth to on 19th April.  They will be three weeks old on Sunday.  This photo (above) was taken when they were about a week old. Now they are scampering around the hutch and having great fun together - such energy! We haven't sexed them properly yet although the YFG is pretty sure that they are all boys.  Rosie has a patch of black on her white neck, which shouldn't be there really, for perfection in the breed, but we love her anyway.  Two of these have patches too - one larger than the other.  Needless to say, I am sure that one of them will end up being named Patch!Leah brought them out this morning. There are just the two of them, as the other eggs were either not fertile in the first place or the jiggling about through the post didn't do them any good. Either way, we have two lovely bantam chicks - they are Silver Wyandotte chicks, which is a breed we have never had before, so that is another first in the Fen garden. The blurry line through some of the pictures is the wire netting of the pen, so I apologise! They are just beginning to get the idea of eating the chick crumbs here, with a good deal of help from Leah. It is her first time as a mother, so I think she is doing a good job so far. She is typically fiercely protective of them. Above is probably the best shot of the pair of them - still a little blurry - funny, they will keep moving! And this last one was Leah in the nest with them. Hope you like them - I borrowed the camera from my neighbour as mine is on a cruise in the Baltics, so I will borrow it again next Friday and take some more."},

I have seen two tiny black and yellow heads poking up from between the wings of the lovely mama bantam.  I am so pleased and excited - I will be hovering around her pen now until she brings them out so that we can see exactly how many there are and how healthy they are looking.  May have to wait for that until tomorrow...."},

We have everything crossed that she manages to bring off at least a couple of chicks from the clutch of six eggs.Yesterday was another day of nursing and chores around the house.  All these things just have to be done each day, and there is some comfort in the routines.  I got a lot of washing done, although there is still more to hang out this morning.  I have found a couple of new customers for eggs, and the FH has asked for egg custard today, so I will get that made soon - and it will use up maybe half a dozen eggs too.  I think that I may pop a cake in the oven whilst I am at it, as the YFG was bemoaning the lack of cake in the past couple of weeks.The rain has been and gone - and to be honest, the ground doesn't seem to have benefitted very much at all.  My uncle has advised putting a straw mulch around the strawberries, partly to keep the fruit clean and off the soil, but also to conserve moisture in the soil.The EFG was back at school yesterday after her week at home last week - and has come home with a disconcerting rumour that a girl in Y9 will be returning to school today, fresh from a holiday in Mexico.  Whether that is true or not, I will have to wait and see.  I am beginning to think that perhaps people coming back from affected areas should stay home for a few days to make sure that they don't develop any symptoms before they mix with the world at large, and especially in a close environment like a school.  According to the BBC map, there aren't any cases in East Anglia yet, and I was hoping that it would stay that way!"},
{"title": "Rain at last!", "date": "Monday 4 May 2009", "text": "Yes - we should have known that the rain would come today on the Bank Holiday. It held off most of the day, but it is a steady rain now, and I am hoping that it will continue into the night, as the ground really needs it!I am becoming overwhelmed with eggs now; there are about 4 and a half trays of them sitting in the cool of the utility room. I looked into using waterglass to preserve some of them, but having read a report about an experiment, it seems that refrigeration will keep them fresher more reliably for up to about 6 months which seems amazing! Maybe it is time to look for a cheap secondhand fridge and just keep them in there. I remember my grandmother using waterglass but it was a long time ago and no one seems to know much about doing it these days, much less where to buy the chemical, sodium silicate, to do it!The YFG has been on a 20 mile bike ride with her friend, T, and T's family. It took them about 4 hours, with a stop for lunch in a park, so that was quite good going, considering that the youngest member of the party was a seven-year old. The EFG and I have done a few jobs around the house and had to go on a shopping trip; the FH is still ill. I decided that some probiotic drink might do him some good, and he wanted some treacle tart. Normally, I would have made some, but there just isn't time at the moment. He has had a sliver of it for tea tonight as he says that he isn't really hungry but just wants a taste of something nice.The shopping trip was also to get some wool as the FGs decided that they wanted to see if they could still knit - they learned many moons ago, and wanted to have another go. Unfortunately, they seem to have forgotten all they knew, but they are slowly getting the hang of it, with some teething troubles - the YFG keeps increasing her stitches quite dramatically, and the EFG is keeping hers much too tight, to the stage that there was just nothing I could do with it at one stage and we had to undo it. Practice makes perfect and all that, so we will be doing plenty of practising. I haven't knitted anything seriously since I knitted a cardigan whilst pregnant with the YFG. I was very into knitting back then, and knitted vests for the EFG whilst pregnant, and made a couple of cardigans as well. I'd love to get back into it - one day, I will! I have a project to finish, if nothing else: I began a jumper for myself when I was about 16. I have the back done, and the sleeves, but the front has been half-done for too long! Luckily it was a classic rather than a fashionable design, so it'll be good to wear when I do get there....."},
{"title": "A Slow Sunday", "date": "Sunday 3 May 2009", "text": "Yes, it has been good and slow!  I took the girls to church this morning and then came home, got changed and have been pottering in the garden all day!  The ground is getting drier and drier and some of the beds are in a bad way - the clay soil has just dried out into the most unco-operative of large lumps!  I used the electric rotavator on some of it today to try to break it up a little but it was hard work and not terribly useful.  The worst bed has just had the squashes planted in it - courgette, butternut and pumpkin - as they don't demand terribly friable soil.  I weeded the strawberries yet again, finished strimming around the beds and have started weeding one of them ready to plant the peas. I have now got three broody hens, whom I have to fight each afternoon for the eggs which they are sitting on!  I am hoping to get in touch with a lady near Wisbech to get some more Orpington eggs for them to sit on.  We had eggs from her last year and had a good hatch rate.The ironing heap has been left to rest another night, but there is a good night of TV tonight, so I think that I can use the ironing as an excuse to watch TV all evening."},
{"title": "Pottering along", "date": "Saturday 2 May 2009", "text": "Today has been a good day where I have had a lot to do and got most of it done!  Started with a trip to Ridgeons (local builder's merchant) where I picked up some wood and other bits and pieces for the FH, who still can't go too far from a loo, then it was gymnastics for the rest of the morning.  We popped to the shops afterwards for odd items like apples, walnut pieces and turkey legs, then came home.  This afternoon has been spent in the garden, cutting the lawn, strimming the edges, talking over cups of tea, etc - all in a very pleasant manner.  The YFG has been busily playing with her friend on her new Street Gliders, and then they have done their homework together....hope they didn't make too many mistakes at it!  Now I am considering another heap of ironing - but I may keep considering and leave it to rest another night...I am looking forward to having Monday \"off\" from the routines of the school run and clock watching, but on the other hand it is reassuring to know that I will have the regular things to do with the chickens, quail and rabbits - some routines are comforting, but some are intrusive.  Roll on the summer holidays, I say!Thanks for the good wishes about our health - with me it is just an overwhelming tiredness which I can't get over yet, and the girls are both well and healthy now, thanks.  If we could get the FH sorted, we'd be laughing.  I think that the doctor will look at the test results next week and maybe something will improve.  Let's hope so."},
{"title": "All kinds of bugs", "date": "Friday 1 May 2009", "text": "The FH is still ill, so that is one kind of bug I could do without.  Sleepless nights, disturbed nights, whatever you want to call them, I've been having them!  Consequently, I am Tired.  With a capital T.  I snatched an hour on the sofa this morning and was very glad to hear the bin men come as I wouldn't have woken up to get the YFG to school.The cherry tomatoes have got green fly - I think.  They definitely have small green creatures on them, so I have ousted them from the greenhouse before they share them around, and will have to look into ways to get rid of them.  Spraying them with soapy water has been suggested, so I am looking for a spray bottle now.  Apart from that, the garden is growing very well - too well, in the case of the grass - I am going to have to do some mowing and strimming this weekend.  The beans I planted last week are germinating slowly, the lettuce seeds have sprouted through and the courgettes are growing their second, true leaves.No more photos for a couple of weeks as my dad has borrowed my camera for his holiday snaps.  He's off on Monday on a cruise around the northern Baltics, I think - Russia gets included, and Talinn, but I am not sure where else they will be going.  They have been on this cruise before, but I am sure they will see different things this time.  They brought me a Russian calendar with pictures of all the lovely palaces and their gardens in St Petersburg the last time they went.Eggs - still being laid at an astonishing rate - I am looking for more customers!"},
{"title": "More babes", "date": "Monday 27 April 2009", "text": "I am sure I forgot to say, but the matriarch of the rabbits here has had another litter of kittens - they were born last Sunday so they are now about 8 days old.  They are fattening up nicely, so she must be feeding them well.  We had an issue with a litter a couple of years ago which she didn't feed, so it is a relief to see these ones healthy and growing.  Including the two which were born earlier in the year to a younger rabbit, there are now 5 babes in the nests! Hopefully the chicks will hatch from the eggs in a couple of weeks and we will be feeling very Spring-like with all this new birth around us.  We are talking about getting some more day-old chicks to rear as well - some for meat and some for eggs, so hopefully we'd get a good mix of the sexes.  The girls have done me proud today and laid 20 eggs - and the quail managed 5 between them too.   I have a rooster in the slow cooker, which is about done now, so that is going to get taken off the bone, chilled and probably frozen as no one here is up to eating much. I didn't get to go to the interviews at the school today, because of my nursing duties, but the YFG was asked to go along and take part as she is on the school council.  They have appointed a teacher, so here's hoping she's a good 'un!Refreshing spring rain is drizzling down here today! Quick post as too much to do - EFG has been awake much of the night feeling sick and I have had to fetch the doctor out to the FH as he is still suffering.  YFG has caught a lift to school with a neighbour and is having school lunches all week so that I can be sure that she gets a decent meal.  What with the lurgeys we have got here, I am not doing a lot of cooking at the moment.Hope you are having a better day wherever you all are."},
{"title": "Spring sunshine", "date": "Sunday 26 April 2009", "text": "The days are lovely at the moment and it has encouraged me to get our garden into gear.Unfortunately, the FH has been \"under the weather\" with some kind of stomach bug since last Sunday, so he is not able to get out and about to enjoy the sunshine. I am hoping that he will be on the mend this week. He always takes longer than normal people to get better as he has a compromised immune system since he takes a lot of immunosuppressant drugs since he had a heart transplant 10 years ago. He is OK in himself, just spending time in the bathroom!!!The YFG had to stay at home on Friday as her sickness continued until 10pm, and we are not allowed to send kids back to school until 24 hours have passed since the last bout of it. She was OK on Friday and felt much better, but it did her good to have a rest. We did go to gymnastics on Friday and Saturday - we couldn't miss the Saturday session in particular as a photographer came from the local paper to snap shots of the girls who won medals in the competition a few weeks ago. We'll be looking out for the paper to come this week with some anticipation - and they have new competition leotards as well, so it would be lovely if they print a colour photo!Today we slept in, and didn't make it to church. After gym yesterday I was too tired to do the shopping, so we went to Sainsbury's today and stocked up. The girls and I have had some veg stir fry and smoked salmon (the very cheapest trimmings, I promise!) for lunch and since then, we have had the new neighbour and her 18 month old daughter round to see the rabbits and chickens, hung out some washing and now another boy is here, playing on the computer with the EFG. He'll have to go soon as we have some chores to get done before supper, and then it will be full steam ahead into school mode for tomorrow - for me as well, as we start the interviewing process at 9am for the three candidates at school.I have been shocked and saddened this week to learn of yet another neighbour in financial difficulties, and it has prompted me to wonder whether it is possible to help these people and if so, how one would do it? Obviously I would not offer actual monetary aid, but I wonder sometimes whether there is a need for some kind of housewife-ly (that isn't a word, but it is what I mean!) guidance towards the stewardship of money and making it go further and do more. The lady told me that when the mortgage rate was high, all their money went on paying the mortgage and they had to use their credit cards to \"live\". This has unfortunately meant that now the mortgage rate has come down, they are no better off as the interest rates on the credit cards are sky high and they have big balances to pay off. Consequently they are still struggling. Although we can see from hindsight that this was not a wise thing to do at the time, I don't for one minute think that they are the only people to have used this strategy to cope, for whatever reason.I have heard the opinion passed that we are lucky that we don't have a mortgage, but we wouldn't get one nowadays! Our income is low in comparison to others, at less than £20K a year. We live in a house that we bought for £215K five years ago, so it isn't worth any more than that now, although it was valued at £250K a few years ago, before that so-called \"bubble\" burst. We own two old cars - one we have had for ten years, and one we have had for about 7, both bought second hand. They are both estate cars - we bought the first for £8K from Network Q, so it has cost us roughly £800 a year but the other one was a bigger bargain as the FH bought it from a colleague for £1000, and it is a trouper! I see no reason to buy a brand new car, and would never do so. There are other cars in driveways on streets up and down the country which are newer, flashier, and have hundreds more gadgets, but you know what - I'd rather sleep at night, knowing that mine is paid for and can't be repossessed.I read somewhere about the secret millionaires of this world; you would pass them on the street, they buy good quality items which last, they don't follow fashion, they are frugal (like the Queen!) and careful with their money. They don't \"look\" rich, because they are not ostentatious with their wealth. We are a million miles away from being millionaires (pardon the pun) but we are living in a similar way, and probably taking it a step further because we sometimes \"look\" poor to those who judge by appearances.Appearances are deceptive, and this family this week that shocked me with their own revelation about their financial problems are not people who would look as if they are in trouble. Just goes to show that you just can't tell.To make a contribution to helping other families, our family top ten tips for managing money:1. Keep good records of every penny spent by all members of the family - from the odd packet of crisps at the newsagents to the supermarket shop to the phone bill and the car tax - EVERY penny has to be accounted for to know where it is going.2. Plan. Know when the bigger/annual amounts need to be paid and put money aside each month towards them. We take our big/annual payments (house insurances, car-related payments for tax and insurance, heating oil, etc), add them up and divide by 12, add another £10 a month and pay that much into a separate account. The money is then there when it is needed and doesn't come as a big surprise! You can also do this for Christmas/birthday funds.3. Meal planning. One of the major things we spend money on regularly is food - so it makes sense to be in control. It doesn't mean deciding what you want to eat this week and then going out to buy it, though. We operate the pantry principle which basically means buying what is the best value for money and then making meals from that. It also means that we don't ever buy takeaway because we are too tired/can't be bothered/\"don't know\" what to cook!4. Stockpiling When items that we use regularly go on special offer, we buy them - a lot of them! Whatever it is, if we have room to keep it, we buy as much as we can store or we can afford to buy. Obviously, this works best for dry foods, tinned food, frozen items and cleaning/paper goods. It is a good idea to assign a little money each time you go shopping for these kinds of items, as it will save you money in the long run. You do need to keep track of what you have got, and rotate your stock to keep the things fresh.5. Accept everything you are offered because if you don't, people stop offering! You may be lucky, as we are, to occasionally receive surplus garden produce from relatives and friends. Some of it goes in the freezer and some is re-gifted to others, who we know will also appreciate it. Of course, to keep life going round, it is good to be able to offer things ourselves as well, as we do with eggs and outgrown clothes, and some garden produce.6. Save up, save, and save! We save up for new purchases that we need to make rather than buying on HP or credit arrangements, or loans. HP, credit and loans cost money in the long run in one way or another generally and I prefer not to go there. It is a discipline thing as well, as I would be concerned that I would be lured into more such purchases and then it would be a slippery slope - so know your boundaries and stick to them. The second \"Save\" is just that - we put aside a proportion of our income into savings each month. Some months it is more than others, but there is always a little moved over into savings. That provides us with an emergency cushion against all sorts of disasters, and gives us a feeling of security. And the third \"Save\" is about saving things - rescuing them - repurposing or recycling. Don't throw away something which could still have a use and could usefully prevent us from having to spend money. We save all sorts of things: loo roll inner tubes for planting beans, margerine tubs for freezing portions of food, vegetable peelings for the compost heap, etc. Don't go mad in this department and get yourself overrun with rubbish!7. Educate the children because if we don't bring up our children to behave responsibly in a financial sense, no one else will. Our children understand that there is a pretty much fixed amount of money each month, and they know that there are priorities for that income. A new DS game is very low down on that list! They buy their own games with money given to them for Easter, birthdays, etc, or they earn it. There are always things that they can do on top of their normal jobs if they want to earn money. They don't get pocket money - no one ever gave me money for doing nothing! If something is important to them, they are keen and happy to contribute to the cost of the purchase - after all, if it is not important enough for them to work for it, why should I? The FGs are both careful with their money, and we do require that they save half of all they are given, so they think about what they want, and will often delay buying something to think about it a bit longer!8. Mums, stay home with the kids or at least do a job which doesn't involve childcare. I have never been employed in a 9-5 job since I had the girls, always having preferred the flexibility of self-employment. I know that this one is not an option for everyone, but it can help the family finances as often the second job costs as much as it brings in when travel, childcare, clothing, convenience foods, help in the house perhaps, etc are all factored in. A mum or dad at home can do a lot to save money for the family - and that contribution can mean as much to the family finances as actually bringing in a wage packet.9. Don't follow fashion of any kind! Know what you like and stick to it. Be brave and be different. A thrifty friend of ours back in Scotland painted all the rooms in her house white - white walls everywhere and white woodwork and doors. Then she had one carpet laid throughout the bungalow, in a semi-neutral colour pattern, and she just accessorised each room slightly differently, and she had a charming, welcoming and restful home. Similarly with clothing, one friend here always wears jeans - Monday to Friday she wears jeans when she is out and about, and her at-home uniform is grey joggers and a matching grey fleece. It sounds boring, but it saves her a fortune and who sees what she is wearing at home anyway!? It is timeless and classic, and it is easy to care for. I chuckle to myself when I see high-fashion in the playground at the school; most of us are very practical mums here, people like me who may just have rushed to the school straight from the garden, the dog-groomer who has nipped up to the school in between clients, the gardener in her wellies back from the horticultural college where she teaches, the stables owner, for example - this is real life that most of us are living, and we don't need that kind of day-to-day attire. Keep it real for your life situation.10. Dare to be different in all kinds of ways. Shop once a month, walk everywhere, grow veggies, keep chickens and quail, drive old cars, holiday on the Costa del Cromer, but above all, have fun with your families doing it! That is not a cop out number 10 - that is really the crux of the matter. Daring to stand up to the waves of easy credit, pressure to go to work in a career, put kids into childcare, buy takeaways or Macdonalds because it is what \"everyone\" does.......well, I think that people are beginning to realise that there must be another way, and we are already some way down that path. It's not always an easy path, but we sleep well at night and we have some fantastic times with our families.Gosh, I'd better shut up now!"},
{"title": "Still in the garden", "date": "Thursday 23 April 2009", "text": "The washing got done, the plants were potted up - a couple of peppers, the tomatoes and a butternut squash, and the lettuce plugs are tucked into one of the raised beds.  The quail have been moved, and have laid 4 eggs between them today so perhaps they like their new quarters.  And I have weeded the strawberry bed - and found a couple of strawberry plants under the weeds, so there are more than I had thought! The YFG is on the mend, I hope - she has just had some toast, so I am praying that stays down.  She has had a little sleep this afternoon as well.  And the FH has done a little of the ironing pile, so there is a little less for me to do later.  If he goes off to bed early to watch TV, I will be putting a DVD on to get me through the pile!Seeds have been sown, some of the quail are in their new house, and I went to Delfland Nursey yesterday and bought more plants for the garden.  Most of them were vegetable/salad plug plants to give us a head start on the season, but I also got 4 cherry tomato plants, and some fuschias and geraniums for the hanging baskets, as well as (got SO excited about this!) 5 raspberry canes - we may actually have some raspberries this autumn!  They are late fruiting ones, so I think that they will fruit on the new growth they are putting up now.  Must get those planted today!I got so much done yesterday that I was impressed with myself.  Apart from the gardening and washing, the trip to the nursery and the other general stuff I do every day, I also cut a neighbour's son's hair, and had a school board meeting, which went on a bit.  We had a lot to talk about as we are interviewing for a new teacher on Monday.The YFG has thrown up this morning so she is at home, watching TV in bed!  That means that today's plans have had to be altered slightly, but hey, that is a mother's privilege to be able to move plans around to fit with sick kids!  Nothing's so important that it can't wait another day or week, so now I already have plans for next Thursday...The revised plans for the day now include a big heap of ironing, some laundry, getting the plants sorted in the garden, and moving the other quail into the lower apartment of the new house.  One of this second group died yesterday, unfortunately, but she was a weak bird and had been for some time.  She didn't seem to be actually ill, just weak and not able to eat as much as the others - perhaps the pecking order kept her at the bottom.  Anyway, whilst we mourned her passing yesterday, we have 10 others to look after.  They laid three eggs between them yesterday and so we are hoping that they are getting the idea a bit more now!"},
{"title": "So much to say, where to start?!?!", "date": "Monday 20 April 2009", "text": "Last Wednesday, I thought that I would take the FGs to Church Farm at Stow Bardolph, just north of Downham Market on the A10. However, we stopped en route in DM to go to the famous shoe shop where we got the YFG's winter boots. The same wonderful woman, Tracy, was in the shop, and she remembered the YFG's funny feet and helped us to find some summer school shoes for her. We eventually came out with a pair of black Primigi Italian leather shoes for £36, which I was pleased with, price-wise, having expected Italian soft leather to be more expensive. All this retail therapy meant that it was 1.30 by the time we got to the farm, and I was loath to pay £17.50 for the three of us to go in there for just a couple of hours, when I could see from the car park that the place was packed out and there would be queues everywhere. So, we travelled along the A10 a little further and went to Ely. The EFG has been studying Oliver Cromwell in history, so we went to the Oliver Cromwell house/museum in Ely for a good hour's mooch round. It was fascinating, and good for education as well as interest. After that, we had a wander through the city streets and walked back to the car via the ice cream van and the cathedral, where I took these photos.This one is (I think) the south side of the cathedral, and the YFG is posing there to show just how HUGE it is!We do like to go into the cathedral and have a look round, but they charge £4 per person, so we make an occasion of it when we do go in. We are going to a service there at the beginning of May so we are looking forward to that already.The \"girls\" were happily waiting for their breakfast this morning when I took this shot from the roof of the hen house - it was the best place to get a decent picture of them all, but it was a teeny bit precarious up there... They just love to scratch around in the straw for their corn, and have enormous fun running after bits of bread that we chuck in as a treat for them some days. Here is the nest that one of the Dutch bantams made - she had sneaked away and found this incredibly tight spot between some bags of fire wood, lined a hollow with dead grasses and bits of straw, and laid 10 eggs! With no resident cockerel with which to consort, these weren't going to hatch for her, so I have bought half a dozen Silver Wyandotte bantam eggs for her to sit on, from a breeder on ebay, so I hope they hatch as the postage cost more than the eggs! These are the eggs, just as they arrived on Wednesday morning - we put them under her on Wednesday evening and moved her into a proper broody house so she and the eggs are safe, and the chicks will be enclosed there with her once they hatch out.And these are some of the gloriously varied eggs which are being laid by our lovely girls - don't they look great?This is the chocolate-sponge, fondant iced creation that the YFG made all on her own for Easter. She ate the last bit this afternoon. It was all her own work and design - well done!More photos coming soon!"},

The girls in the hen run are doing us proud - yesterday we had the most eggs to date and counted ourselves blessed with 18 eggs but then today, they have surpassed themselves and laid 20!  Huge round of applause for the ladies!!(Could someone have a word, though, and just tell them that that is fine, and we can't really cope with more than that on a daily basis?!?)Loads more to tell but got to go to bed now, so will try to catch up at the weekend."},
{"title": "Getting on with it all", "date": "Tuesday 14 April 2009", "text": "I have come back from the second weekend of gymnastics training absolutely exhausted.  I rushed around here like a mad thing on Thursday and Friday last week, trying to get bags packed and things ready for the journey, as well as leaving the house in a reasonable condition for the FH and EFG who were staying here.  My temper built up and then erupted on Friday evening when I just wasn't getting things done! I did manage to get some seeds sown - huge relief!  Four kinds of tomatoes (a plum, a tumbling cherry type, a \"normal\" type and a larger-than-average kind), two kinds of squashes, courgettes, and spinach were actually sown in pots, and then lots of beans (dwarf, runner and broad) were put in jam jars of water to soak.  They will probably get planted tomorrow.  The autumn sown broad beans are coming on really well, and have loads of flowers, so I am hopeful of a good crop there in a while.  There will be more seed sowing done in the weeks to come as I get up to speed in the greenhouse.The quails are still living in the greenhouse although the FH is building them two new cages, of a high-rise variety, one above the other.  We are experiencing a very steep learning curve with these quail!  You may recall that we thought we had separated the males from the females after some feather-pecking incidents.  We discovered that we were wrong when we found some eggs in the \"male\" cage.......both kinds are laying eggs, but the eggs are different so we have come to the conclusion that there are two kinds of quail here.  It may not be the end of the story, but that is the latest episode.  Today I hard-boiled 9 quail eggs - cooked them for 4 minutes and they have come out perfectly.  Trouble is that one doesn't even make a mouthful!  Interesting to note that the inside of the shell is a beautiful light blue.Some of our neighbours are moving out on Thursday so we are a bit sad to see them go.  They are moving to the Welsh border area, where they will enjoy the more hilly countryside as they had come here from rolling fields and found our flatlands rather, well, flat!  They have two dogs and love walking, so I hope that they will be very happy over there.  The lady has been a good customer to me for eggs, so I was pleased to hear that she has recommended me to the incoming family.The girls have been to the local town today for a multi-sport day, and had a good run-around.  The YFG now has a friend here on the trampoline, and the EFG has got her laptop out, half-watching TV with the FH and half playing something on the pc.  We had my uncle here to tea last night, bringing some of the bounty of his garden - sprouting broccoli, leeks and cauliflowers - he only asked for half a dozen eggs in exchange so I am sure I got the better deal.  For tea we had one of the last batch of home-grown chooks and it was excellent; a very meaty bird with some firm, densely packed meat that had very good flavour.Off to put my feet up for half an hour with a cup of tea!"},
{"title": "First Holiday week nearly gone", "date": "Thursday 9 April 2009", "text": "Thursday already and tomorrow Good Friday!  I can't believe that the week has slipped past so quickly. We had a \"down\" day on Monday to recover from the gymnastics day on Sunday.  The gym itself wasn't so tiring but what knocked me sideways was the early start and the driving - just over 3 hours all told.  The YFG was tired out from the gym, but then she worked really hard and I was proud of her.Tuesday we went to the dentist and it was the EFG's turn to make me proud, as she had to have a filling and she hardly flinched at all.  It is not good that her teeth needed a filling, but I was pleased at the way she took the injection, the drilling and the numbness around her mouth. Yesterday the FH went out to his lunch club in the village and the YFG was at a friend's house for the day so the EFG and I had a sort of quiet day - I mowed the front lawn and dug over another of the raised beds in the back garden.  The EFG also had a friend round to have lunch together.  When the FH came home, I took the EFG off to town to spend the £50 giftcard I won in the Sainsbury's Active Kids prize draw (yes, people do actually win those things!) so we got some new clothes for both of us, the Faryl CD, the Waterhorse DVD, some new earrings for both of the girls, and some Tshirts for the FH so everyone got something courtesy of Sainsbury's! Today has been another day of getting things done - haircuts this morning, done by my friend for whom I bake cakes in return so I did her a cake quickly before she turned up at 10.45am.  She did the girls as well as me, and then stayed for a cuppa afterwards, and her daughter stayed for lunch too.  We had to go to the other nearby town this afternoon to the doctor's for the EFG, so we dropped our visitor home on the way.  I have also been starting to get things ready for this weekend - I have put some bits and pieces in a box to take to the caravan for our overnight stay on Saturday, and I need to find another sleeping bag - there's four here somewhere, but I can only lay my hand on one!  The YFG and I will be staying there as it is closer to Norwich so it cuts down on the travelling for us - we have to be there both days this weekend.The family Easter meal will be Sunday night when we get home at about 7.30 and I am looking forward to it already!"},
{"title": "All getting too much...", "date": "Monday 6 April 2009", "text": "I have to keep apologising for not keeping up to date, but there has been so much to do and think about this week that I haven't had time to be here.In brief (no, I don't really do \"brief\", do I?!?) the quails have continued to lay eggs so that we now have a little clutch of five.  The debate rages over what to do with them - poach them, fry them, hard boil them?  We can't decide.  The female quail have had to be moved to a new pen as we have now realised that there are 5 male and 6 female which means that the males were being rather amorous a bit too often for these poor females and they were pecking them on the back of the necks and one was bleeding a little.  Separating them means that the females are getting a break and they can recover their composure and their feathers in peace.The hens are doing well and we are now getting a dozen eggs most days.  I had mentioned to someone (GTM, I think) that I hadn't counted them lately, so I have had a headcount and there are: 9 assorted brown hens (Orpington crosses/pure Orpingtons/Buff Sussex/one ISA hybrid), 3 black hens (2 golden laced Barnvelders and one which is possibly a Silver Sussex cross) and between 14 and 16 white Sasso hens - they are hard to count as they keep moving and all look similar so forgive the inaccuracy of that count.  There is also a turkey stag in there with them.  The FH has killed 5 cockerels today - we have decided that the hens we killed for meat earlier in the year definitely had more meat on them than these cockerels.  They really are quite lean so the best thing to do is going to be to cook in the slow cooker and then use the meat for pies and stirfry rather than trying to roast the whole bird.I haven't sown a single seed and am getting quite behind in the garden.Yesterday I spent the day at Norwich Gym Club with the YFG doing the first day of the three day course to move up a level in coaching.  We will be going back next weekend for the other two days of the course.  It's fun and challenging, so we are enjoying it, and the YFG is loving the gym there as it is a permanent set-up and has pits to land in, and a ground-sunk trampoline - she loves it! School holidays are here, so we have dentist and doctor appointments this week, and then two multisport days next week in the local town, and a few spare days to fill in between.  We think that we might go to Wimpole Hall for the lambing if the weather is OK next week.  We haven't been there for lambing for a few years, so that would be a good day out.Will try to check back again soon!"},
{"title": "Stay of execution!", "date": "Tuesday 31 March 2009", "text": "Finally, the quails have laid! I have just found two eggs!  I was so excited that I had to run round and tell my neighbour as the FH has had to go out for the day.  My neighbour is an ex-chef and had promised quail recipes if I needed them - I don't now...the only thing is that of course, we don't know which bird(s) laid these eggs, so we hope that there will be more in the days to come. Sorry to have been away again - practising and preparations for the gymnastics competition at the weekend took over.The competition took place on Sunday in Peterborough.  It was a very early start as we were there at 8.30am, and it was the morning after we changed the clocks forward so we got an hour's less sleep anyway.  We did try to go to bed early but the YFG was just so excited that she couldn't sleep, and declared on Sunday that she hadn't \"had a wink of sleep all night\" (but she had!).  She leapt up and was ready and raring to go! It was an Eastern Region competition at Level 1 and 2, and Level 2 Open.  Last year the YFG was just beginning to compete so was at Level 1, but having won three medals, had to move up to Level 2 this year.  This is a bit more demanding, and she coped well.  The club took along 19 gymnasts, although there were three sessions across the day so they weren't all there at the same time. When the medals were announced for the YFG's age group, we were on tenterhooks.  She had vaulted well, and the choreographer had been pleased with her bench and floor routines, and then the HC thought her bars had gone well, so we were hopeful of something.  Her face said it all though, as medal after medal was announced and other girls' names called out to receive them.  Then, finally, the very last medal to be announced, Gold medal on the Floor - and it was hers!!!!! The relief on her face was clear - and I was so proud, and relieved too that she had won something.The club had a good haul of medals: we took 19 gymnasts, as I have said, and we brought home 34 medals; 11 Gold, 10 Silver and 13 Bronze.  17 of the children won at least one medal, and several won a collection - the two boys I had been coaching in particular collected 7 - and that included 3 Golds!  The club also took the hat-trick of medals in two age groups for the floor routine, so we are very pleased with that result."},

I am ashamed to admit that this poor table had been buried under a mountain of clutter for nearly two months, forcing us to eat from plates on our laps.  Not what I wanted for our family.   However, I spent most of Monday clearing this table, and we have eaten meals on it ever since.  The challenge is now to keep it clear.   I recently resurrected the utility room from under a pile of junk and I am managing to keep that generally tidy and usable.  The trouble with that room is that the family has got used to coming in the back door and just dumping things there - coats, shoes, dirty clothes for the washer, eggs, garden produce, etc and it just got overwhelmed!  The room also does duty as my pantry storage area, so it is actually quite important to keep it clean.Having rescued the dining table and the utility room, I am off to sort out the airing cupboard this afternoon.......I will be back....."},
{"title": "Now the day is over", "date": "Sunday 22 March 2009", "text": "Nearly over.  It has been a good day - the girls brought me cards, plants for the garden and a lovely pair of earrings. Church was a thoughtful service, and everyone was given a flower, and then after church, my neighbour brought me a small posy of flowers from her church too. My uncle came and shared lunch with us - chicken and leek pie - and my dad arrived before my uncle left so we all had a cup of tea together. Tonight I have washed the FGs' hair and they are watching the final of the ice dancing show right now before heading off to bed, and I am planning to turn the pc off and go and do the ironing whilst I watch the No1 Ladies Detective Agency programme at 9pm.Motherhood is indeed a privilege.Is it good to be busy all the time?  Is it to be admired in someone that they are too busy to do something?  How do we feel about busy people?  Are busy people better in some way than someone who has more free time? I admit that there is always a long list of things which I want to accomplish on any given day.  Does that make me \"busy\"?  I don't know.  I don't feel like a busy person, but I do feel like someone who has lots to do.  The EFG noticed that I don't sit down an awful lot unless I am at the computer!  Most of the things which I do are of my own choosing - cooking and baking from scratch most days, gardening, looking after the chickens, coaching gymnastics, school governing, etc - a lot of those things are occupations which I could choose not to do, but I do them because I like to, and they benefit me and my family in one way or another.  Unfortunately, there are other things which I don't choose to do quite as often as I should, like decluttering, which would also be of benefit to my family and I would be happier if I did more often........I'll fling a few things this afternoon!  Guess what? Those are the things which I like doing less!  I know that I rarely turn anyone down if they ask me to do something.  That could be seen as weakness, an inability to say, \"No\" but on the other hand, I know that I can ask for help or time off when I need to - I didn't coach gym on Saturday mornings last summer term as I didn't feel up to it, and the HC was fine about it.  He was understanding and let me have the time out. What's brought this on?  Someone said to me this morning that she was too busy to make jam.  That, to me, is laughable and sounded like an excuse.  If you like making jam, you find time.  If you don't like doing it, you buy it or do without."},
{"title": "Mother's Day tomorrow", "date": "Saturday 21 March 2009", "text": "Tinged with joy at being a mother, tinged with sorrow at the absence of my own mother. I haven't been able to share a Mothering Sunday (she always called it that) with her since 1997 as she passed away early in 1998 and it still hurts.  The fact that I have had my own two pink bundles of joy means that I still get to celebrate the day, but being what we describe as the oldest blood female in our particular line makes me the matriarch at 36 - and I really shouldn't be.  Ideally the two generations before me would still be here, but my grandmother was 98 when she died in 2002; she was in her mid thirties when she had my mother, who was also in her mid thirties when she had me, so they both left it relatively late for their eras to have their children.  I, on the other hand, was a young mother at 23 in this day and age when more women are leaving it later to have their children.  That last Mothering Sunday in 1997 when we were all four generations alive (I can't say \"and well\" but alive was an achievement for my mother) was a day to have been remembered. And so, motherhood - the \"holiest\" of occupations, I read recently.  The greatest gift I have ever been given, and the most awesome responsibility.  The scariest thing, and most wonderful, children have brought me amazing joy as well as terrible fear.  The FH wonders often what the world will be like for them as they grow older - but he is older and has seen more change in his lifetime - he can remember life before televisions, let alone pre-computers! Tomorrow, we are going to church first of all, then my uncle is coming over for lunch.  My dad might also visit during the afternoon, so I think that I will be doing a little baking after church so that we have some cake ready for tea!  Simnel cake was traditionally made for Mothering Sunday before it got taken over by Easter, but marzipan is not a great favourite here so I won't be making one of those!  One of the chickens is going in the slow cooker overnight and then will become a chicken pie for tomorrow's lunch - a family favourite."},

{"title": "Striped Pyjamas", "date": "Thursday 19 March 2009", "text": "I bought the DVD of \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\" through Amazon this week and it just arrived the other day.  Since the YFG took a sickie today (she has the head cold which I am also suffering from), we watched it this afternoon when I got home from working.  I had read the book and she had had it read to her at school, so we both knew the story - but the film is, in our opinion, brilliant.  The young Bruno is excellently acted, and the whole thing plays around his ignorance of the work camp/death camp situation in WW2 Germany.  There is just so much he doesn't understand, which we as 2009 viewers know, and the terrible ending is harrowing.  The YFG said she \"very nearly\" cried, and I certainly felt very sad.  There is very little in the film about the life inside the camp, because it is mostly about Bruno, of course, so I suggested that we might watch \"Schindler's List\" at the weekend.  I also have the book, \"Schindler's Ark\", which I read quite often.Of course, Oskar Schindler is played by Liam Neeson in the film, which brings me to the tragic death last night of his wife, Natasha Richardson.  We most recently saw her in \"The Parent Trap\" which was on several times just around and after Christmas - at least three times, I think, on various channels!  She was just 45, and her two sons are 12 and 13 - the EFG is 12 so that really made me feel for those two boys. All things considered, then, we have a lot to be thankful for, not least our liberty and our health here tonight."},
{"title": "Picture festival", "date": "Wednesday 18 March 2009", "text": "Finally, some photos!Eggs collected from the nests in my apron - aprons have a lot more uses than one might think! Strawberry plants sending up new leaves for this year's growth - some promise of the fruit to come in the summer. This is Goldenberg, one of our favourite Orpington-type hens.And here are some of the heavy, bred-for-table birds. We haven't eaten any lately, but the FH's fingers are itching to get plucking again, so one of their numbers will be up soon!And here, amidst the chickens, is the turkey. Looking more and more like a vulture these days, we all have a soft spot for the turkey! And here is the one who thinks he's the Boss of the hen house! He is a fine bird, and we think he is a Silver Sussex. He makes an efficient alarm clock these lighter mornings... This is Goldenberg again! The closer two garden beds are the ones which I have recently dug over, and the furthest one has the broad beans which were planted last Autumn. The tubs in the background, recently weeded, are home to the fruit trees. They are all in bud, which is a positive sign! And this is Shadow, the cat who came to stay. She loves the sunshine and luxuriates in the warmth of the sun - she is often to be found under the verandah on a bed of hay or straw. And finally, a Dutch bantam having a dust bath!"},
{"title": "Tuesday comes around again", "date": "Tuesday 17 March 2009", "text": "A lot of today was spent packing books for customers as the deliveries arrived from the book fairs.  Each child's book had to be bagged up and their name and class written on each bag, so this took quite some time. The FH helped me, thank goodness.  The local school in the village will get theirs tomorrow and the other school's will be dropped off on Thursday. I did a little housework this morning too, and caught up with two of my neighbours, but I have to admit that a lot of the time was spent sipping hot lemon juice mixed with honey in a bid to shake off this cold before it really takes hold!  I did also make a flying visit into the town to pick up some Sponsored Read forms from a primary school and bank the children's money which they had raised.  After telephone negotiations with the Headmistress of the school, we have sorted them out to choose £800 worth of books, so they are well pleased as each class teacher in the school will get £100 to spend on books for their class. The weather was disappointing today - I had been hoping for another bright and sunny day like yesterday, but instead we had a cloudy and overcast, chilly day.  It was dry, so we have to be grateful for that, I suppose, but I missed the sunshine.  Tomorrow, if there is some sun, I hope to be able to get out in to the garden and get the third raised bed dug over.  The Head Coach at gym was telling me tonight about all the seeds which he has already sown on his allotment, so I am beginning to feel that I am getting behind!It was another lovely spring day yesterday and I took full advantage of it.  Three loads of washing billowed on the line in the breeze, I walked to school to fetch the YFG home at 3pm, and I made lemon madeira cakes with fresh duck eggs.  Three parcels were posted off to various parts of the country to people who had successfully bid for Duplo bits on ebay, and one of the cakes was delivered to the elderly neighbour who gave me the duck eggs.  The rich yellow yolks really enhanced the colour of the cake and made it appear even more lemony than it was! The FGs went to band practice last night but the FH was not well enough to go so I took them and nipped off to Tesco to buy more baking sugar (caster, I mean) and have a browse for secret presents to stash away for their birthdays.  I treated myself to a DVD of Love Actually for £3 as we had only got the video version - and our video player is no longer working.Today I have woken up with a cold and a sore throat so I am drinking honey and hot lemon drinks and keeping warm.  The weather promises to be good again today, so I think I may spend some time in the garden, although I have the heap of ironing to do and I need to visit a school in town today to sort some paperwork out for them.  And we have gymnastics tonight - I'll need to take my honey and lemon juice along with me to keep my voice going through the evening, I think!"},
{"title": "A glorious Sunday", "date": "Sunday 15 March 2009", "text": "Although it didn't get off to a very early start as I slept in until 11am, I seem to have got a lot of things done today.  The YFG was at a friend's house for a sleepover - I dropped her off there yesterday at about 3pm and she was returned tonight at 7pm so it was quite a long visit.  However, it was just at the other end of the village, and the friend's mother promised to bring her home at any time if she wanted to be brought!The sleep in was the result of a busy week and a lot of interrupted nights as the FH has a bad chesty cough at the moment and is having problems sleeping.  Between his coughing and his TV watching in the night, I am getting woken up a lot.  I slept the majority of last night in the YFG's vacant bed, so I did get a good start on the night! As a consequence of the extra sleep, we missed church this morning.  I got up and made a cup of tea and was able to sit in the back garden in my pajamas to drink it in the sunshine.  After getting dressed, I organised the lunch and then fetched the lawnmower and cut the front lawn.  The chickens were happy to recieve the clippings in to the run to scratch about with and generally peck at.  After lunch, I loaded up the dishwasher and moved the lawnmower to the back garden.  Cutting the back lawn was much harder work as the grass was longer!  It made many more trips to empty the grass collecting basket, and took me about an hour.  Another pleasant hour was spent in the sun, digging over one of the raised beds, with some of the chickens happily foraging for the worms which I was bringing to the surface with every turn of the spade.  The chickens are not meant to be ranging around the garden but some of the lighter pure breed chickens are able to fly out!  A few of them are always out and about in the garden, and whilst it is pleasant to have them keeping you company right now, they will do untold damage to the seeds when I get to sowing time.  We must work out exactly how they are getting out and put a stop to it very soon!The chickens are laying between 8 and 13 eggs each day now, so I have to wash and date the eggs each day so that I make sure that they are sold or used in the correct order.  They are of a variety of sizes and colours and make for an interesting collection in an egg box - so much nicer than the average supermarket box of eggs as I can explain to the people buying the eggs that a Barnvelder laid that darker one, a Dutch bantam laid that tiny one and that lighter coloured egg is probably from one of the white hens. This evening I have ironed my way through quite a heap of laundry whilst watching half of Africa on the TV.  First we saw \"Wild at Heart\" on ITV although we had to miss the last 15 minutes so that we could turn over to BBC1 to see the brand new series made from the books of Alexander McCall Smith - The No1 Ladies Detective Agency - perfectly set in Botswana.  I have read the first 6 of the books and love them, and having seen the film which was made from the first book last year, I have been looking forward to this series ever since I heard it was being made - and it has not disappointed me!  It was lovely and I am already looking forward to the next episode.  We'll have to catch the end of \"Wild At Heart\" on the itvplayer."},
{"title": "Gone but not forgotten", "date": "Saturday 14 March 2009", "text": "Today would have been Charlotte's birthday - Charlotte was a lovely girl whom I had the privilege and honour of coaching at gymnastics.  She died last February in an accident on a Fen road which ended in one of the local \"drains\" - one of the drainage channels used to keep the Fens dry. Here is a link to her memorial site: http://charlotte-elise-walker.gonetoosoon.org/memorial/if you would like to read about her.  I can wholeheartedly endorse everything that is said about her - she was a very special young lady who is missed at gymnastics.  She had been working for a competition with the other girls, and the weekend after her funeral, which I attended with my daughter and the Head Coach, we took the other girls to the competition.  The organisers kindly held a minute's silence for her, and presented us with an engraved medal, which I took to her parents soon afterwards.  Her parents remain in our thoughts and prayers."},
{"title": "I was back - then gone again!", "date": "Friday 13 March 2009", "text": "This week has been nearly as hectic as last week, evidenced by my absence from here.  I am getting the basic things done in my day, but the time has not been there for the extra, more fun things like this.  The priorities have to be the day-to-day living tasks, like trying to keep the house running, feeding the family, etc. I fell down this week on feeding the family - Tuesday night was gym and so the FH had to cook and then Wednesday, I had to be at a school meeting from 5.30 and just wasn't prepared, so the girls made themselves beans on toast, and made gingerbread biscuits for dessert.  Although the FH and I were out all day yesterday, I got my brain in gear and took a lamb joint out of the freezer so I popped that in the oven at 3.30 and we all sat down to a lovely roast dinner at 5pm - veggies and everything.  It was lovely.  Tonight is gym again and the FH is on the cooking rota so he is making steak and kidney pie.  I can't eat that so I'll be having some salmon with veggies when I get home.We have realised (yes - we are a bit late) that the quail are not likely to lay eggs now, as we have had them six months and they are still not laying, so we think that we have been conned and they are probably all males.  They are lovely, plump birds though, so I will be looking for some quail recipes soon!Head over to Rhonda's blog at www.down---to---earth.blogspot.com and read what she says about getting through the recession by going back to basics and really appreciating the Home-maker's role in all of this.  She is so right, and I applaud her for bringing this to the forefront.  More articles like this help us all. Have to go now but I am hoping to have more time to come back at the weekend."},
{"title": "I'm back!", "date": "Monday 9 March 2009", "text": "Yes, last week was busy, but we got through by working together.  Briefly, Monday was spent in preparation, Tuesday was the first book fair, Wednesday was recover and regroup, Thursday was the second, and Friday the third.  The Tuesday/Thursday ones were at the same school, so 150 children and their parents had quite a few hours to look at the books and make orders as I was there in the afternoon and for the Parents' Evening meetings but on Friday, at another school, 300 children had just an hour after school to drag their parents in to the book fair and make their orders - and so it was a frantic hour, with parents queuing up to pay!  I took the FH along to help me on Friday, and my lovely neighbour looked after the girls.The third school which I have been working with has done a Sponsored Read, so my involvement has been minimal so far, just dealing with paperwork and getting it all set up - the work will start next week when I have to count the money and sort out all the sponsor sheets!We didn't get to gymnastics on Tuesday, but we made it on Friday and Saturday.  On Wednesday evening there was a meeting in the village about trying to start up a Brownie group which we went to because the YFG was interested.  She soon lost her interest when she saw that most of the other girls who had gone to find out more were all about 7.  We'll see - it probably won't start until September when she'll have turned 10, and she'll be old enough to go the Guide group instead if she wants to.  Thursday I attended a small meeting about starting a LETS group in the Fen area - Local Exchange Trading System for anyone who hasn't heard of it before - it's a slightly more sophisticated bartering scheme.  We were members of one when we were in Fife and found it an excellent way to meet people and get things done.On Sunday, we had a congregation-led Sunday service as there was no preacher available to come along and do the honours.  The other family with children were responsible for the music and readings and we took care of the prayers - it worked well.  We all sat in a circle and had a good time.  The FH came along to support us as well, which was lovely.  The circuit Superintendent will be in charge next week for Holy Communion so we'll be in safe hands!Today, I have been dealing with the laundry which had built up, washing eggs, and doing more preparation for this week's work.  I'm not sure how busy this week will be - I know I have to go out delivering all day on Thursday, but apart from that, I am taking my time recovering from last week.  I know that I have a Governors' meeting and training night on Wednesday from 5.30pm and then there is another LETS meeting on Thursday but I may have to bow out of that as I won't be up to going out every night of the week, and the Gov meeting is more important this week."},

{"title": "Church bells", "date": "Sunday 1 March 2009", "text": "At gymnastics yesterday morning, we could hear church bells ringing out - and then when I had to nip over the road to get some milk for the tea, I could hear them in all their glory.  It was a lovely spring day, bright and sunny with a fresh breeze, and the bells were pealing out across the town - it was wonderful, and put me in a good mood! Today being the 1st March is the start of another financial challenge for us.  I did not curb spending in February and we spent as normal, which is reasonably frugal, and certainly not lavish, but this month we are going back to the \"essentials only\" kind of spending, which clears out the stock cupboard and makes menu planning interesting.  I have had a delivery of staple items from Asda today (with a voucher code for free delivery) and that came to £74.50 so I am allowing myself £125.50 for the rest of the month for groceries or anything edible - so that includes things like a school dinner on World Book Day for the YFG and it also includes anything that I buy for the garden like fruit bushes or seeds, which are used for the production of food!  That is the maximum I want to spend, and I would like to spend less.  We are well stocked up on everything else, non-food wise, like cleaning items, hygiene items and all that sort of thing!  I'll let you know each week how we are getting on, and what we are eating.  In the months to come, I would like to reduce the amount we spend in these months, as well as the amount we spend in a \"normal\" month, but I think that the best way to go about it is slowly!A busy evening is ahead, wrapping parcels from the sales on ebay, so after tea (casseroled lamb shanks with vegetables), I have to get the FGs' hair wash session over, and get myself set up to watch \"Wild At Heart\" whilst I wrap, and wrap, and wrap.......It shoudn't take that long, I hope.  I also hope to get the other items listed tonight as well, ready for next week.  Sorry about the photos I promised yesterday: the camera has gone AWOL but when I find it, I'll put them up."},
{"title": "Recycling", "date": "Saturday 28 February 2009", "text": "We have successfully recycled the Duplo through ebay and all 7 lots sold last night, with a combined total of £64 odd, which is £4 more than I paid for the job lot from EFG's godmother more than 10 years ago - so all the playtimes that the girls, my childminded children and visiting children have had have been free!  And the best of it is that there is still more to sell.  I didn't list it all at once because of the thought of posting it all off at the same time, so there are about 5 more lots to list this week.  Good result, I thought.Yesterday was such a lovely day that I got outside and dug over one of the vegetable beds.  The horse muck had been sitting on the top and the weather had broken it down and it was perfect for just turning over yesterday.  If the number of worms I found is any indication of the quality of the soil, it is wonderful as there were several there every time I turned the spade over.  I just felt that the sun was shining and it was warm so I had had enough of being inside and wanted to get out and enjoy the sunshine - and it was lovely to be outside with the rabbits in their hutches nearby, the cat watching me and the chickens cackling to themselves just at the bottom of the garden.  I could do that every day.  I will have to do it some more, as there are four more beds that need digging, but one is enough at a time - I had to go for a little walk and deliver some eggs to a friend round the corner in order to let my back straighten out!Lent has arrived and I should have decided what I was going to give up before now, but I haven't really thought about it much.  Given how bad my diet has got lately as I have fallen off the healthy eating wagon completely, and how unwell I feel as a result, I am going to give up sugar for the duration.  Then I will look forward to making a nice cake for Easter Sunday tea as a treat.  I have also enjoyed reading Delia Smith's book, A Feast for Lent, which is a religious book and not a recipe book, in the past, so I may have a hunt through the bookshelves and read that again this year. We are off to gymnastics again this morning.  I have taken some photos to share with you and will hope to get them up this afternoon."},
{"title": "Busy day again", "date": "Thursday 26 February 2009", "text": "I have been out and about today delivering books to 8 different venues, where the customers can look at them and I'll go back in 2 weeks to deliver their orders.  It took me south towards Huntingdon, along the A14 and then back north through the villages.  I left here at 9.15 this morning and just managed to get back to pick the YFG up from school at 3pm.  I found time to call in on my dad whilst I was out, and have a very quick trip into Tesco at Huntingdon to pick up some fruit and veggies.  I have had a treat tonight in that the FH cooked the tea and gave me the night off - hooray for husbands!  He also did the ironing today whilst I was out, so that is wonderful too - I am grateful for all help offered. The chimney has hit a problem - we lit the fire yesterday and the smoke billowed out into the room everywhere!  The flue is not high enough outside, and more pipe has got to be put up.  A couple of friendly window-cleaners were roped into the the job on Wednesday morning, so we'll have to see if we can catch them again as they only charged £20 and a cuppa - bargain!The Duplo I have listed on ebay is doing well - all the lots bar one have sold, and the final prices will be established when the auctions finish tomorrow evening. Then I will have to get them all in the post on Monday morning.  I have had enquiries today from people in Estonia and Croatia!  Maybe Duplo is rare over there.Our hens are laying some huge eggs - this past week we have had some rather large eggs laid which are all having two yolks inside when we crack them.  We had a couple for our Pancake Day/Shrove Tuesday celebrations, although we had them for breakfast on Wednesday as we had gym on Tuesday night and got back quite late to do much cooking, so we postponed it for the next morning - they went down very well.  I am not selling those eggs, but keeping them for ourselves and just selling the normal sized ones.  I have 6 or 7 regular customers now which is good - it means that there are enough eggs for us but plenty to sell as well. Baking day tomorrow."},

I had two booked in and then last night I got a call from a school co-ordinator for whom I have done book fairs in the past.  She realised it was short notice, but was I free at all next week?!  So there is another one to do - I gave her the days I was free last night and she'll call back today after she has spoken to her Headmaster and let me know which day that they have chosen.  It's good for business, but it will be a tiring week!Books are wonderful, although I know that I am biased as books are my work.  I feel so sorry for children whose parents don't appreciate the power of a book - there is so much to be gained from reading!  Quite apart from the obvious, knowledge, children can escape and live other lives through a good book - have experiences, go places, do things!  Reading broadens their horizons in a way that nothing else quite manages - I do get fanatical about books at times!The ebay auctions are progressing well and the Duplo is attracting some bids - thank goodness.  I do have to sort a query that came in last night about the cost of sending some of it to the Czech Republic, so I'll take a trip to the Post Office later this morning and get back to that person with a price.  I don't have any accurate scales here, so I can't look it up online. More work calls to make this morning, and then books to pack for deliveries!   All is well in the garden and chicken runs, so there is nothing to worry about out there.  I can't sow any seeds just yet, although I am itching to get on with it all.  The weather is damp and mild again today, so not much good for hanging the laundry out.  Better go and get on."},

They spent two days at a local secondary school using the sports facilities on Multi-sport days, which they enjoyed.  We also had a trip to the doctor's about the EFG's enlarged tonsil, and then we all had checkups at the dentist!  All these things have to be fitted in somewhere, and holiday time seems as good a time as any so that they don't have to miss any school.  We had gymnastics on Friday and Saturday to catch up on the sessions we had to cancel due to the bad weather a couple of weeks ago.  We have a date for the next competition that we will be entering - 29th March - and it will be held in Peterborough, so we don't have too far to go.  The YFG is looking forward to it, but with some trepidation...The frosts have given way to milder, wetter weather, and the chickens are loving the warmth - some of them are escaping from the runs to potter around in the veg patches.  It is OK at the moment, but once I want to start sowing seeds, they will have to be stopped.  The delivery of feed came this morning so I have been delivering rabbit food and corn to various neighbours who placed orders.  The egg sales are continuing well, and the hens are laying some lovely eggs, some of which have two yolks.On Saturday, we went to my cousin's Vow Renewal ceremony in Spalding.  It was a lovely time, but the girls were rather tired of the waiting around that had to happen.  My uncle came with us and then stayed overnight so that he could go with the girls and the FH to Peterborough yesterday to the Showground where they all took part in a World Record attempt at the greatest number of people sitting down to a Roast Dinner together.   There were 1402 people there, and the Army and RAF chefs did the catering, and the entertainment was provided by a RAF band, which suited the FH down to the ground!  Roast beef, yorkshire puddings, lashings of gravy, roast potatoes, carrots and cauliflower, followed by apple crumble and custard - it was a splendid meal, and they all enjoyed it.  We paid £5 per adult and the children were free, but they still managed to make £6000 profit for the Help the Heroes fund which was magnificent.  Uncle stayed last night and went home this morning once he had seen the girls off to school. Laundry and housework have been the order of the day this morning, along with keeping an eye on my ebay auctions and making some work-related phone calls.  It will soon be time to get my bike out and fetch the YFG home from school and then make an early tea so that they can eat before they go off to band practice tonight."},
{"title": "Friday came and went - and so did the snow", "date": "Saturday 14 February 2009", "text": "The schools were open on Friday, as they should have been - but the girls were rather disappointed as we had a good covering of snow here again and they wanted to stay and play!  The YFG's class were doing a parents' assembly, so I didn't want to miss that anyway.  It was interesting as they have been studying the planets, so the children came out in little groups or pairs and spoke about \"their\" planet - the YFG and her partner had been studying Uranus, so we had heard her talk a few times in preparation!  After the Assembly, the parents got the chance to go into the classroom and see the work that the children have been doing recently, so that was fun too.  She had tidied her drawer in my honour.Today has been a beautifully crisp, clear day, and the FH and I have enjoyed sitting outside under the verandah, drinking a cup of tea in the sunshine at 3pm - the first time this year.  The YFG had her friend round to play and it was good for us to get outside for some peace!  The FH has been busy today starting to put the flue up on the outside of the house.  I have been taking some pictures so I will be able to share a post when it is done to show how it came together a piece at a time.  We were at gymnastics this morning, and that is probably the most I have achieved today - we have a dilemma to solve this week and I spent some time chatting with family this afternoon and surfing the internet in an attempt to find an answer - it'll come, in time.  I have also got my account at the feed wholesaler's set up properly, so I have been speaking to some friends who have animals and letting them know that they can get the food they need for their chickens/ducks/rabbits at cost price.  It looks as though I will be ordering on behalf of about three other families as well as ourselves.  I think that maybe I have done more than it feels like.Tomorrow is Sunday and church - I haven't been able to go for two weeks, so I am looking forward to attending tomorrow.  Will have to raid the freezer or get up early to bake something to share!"},

It can't be helped as the weather was so severely cold last night that the poor things just didn't stand a chance.  We would not have mated them on purpose, but the male was wrongly identified as a female and left in a cage with the female - that will be rectified as soon as we can sort out another hutch for him! The snow is falling here again tonight, and little girls are hoping for a day off school tomorrow!  I hadn't heard that we were expecting snow again - the last forecast I heard yesterday had been that we were to get several bright, dry days.  There has been enough already that it is lying, and it is still falling steadily.  Snow presents all sorts of challenges, and I hate to drive in it, so I have cancelled a trip out to a meeting tonight in a local village; the little roads are often not gritted and with the rain we have had, there will be ice under the snow.  Spring cleaning/rearranging is continuing inside the house, and my friends and I are all longing for spring!"},

It's not all here, though, as some parts we ordered have been missed out of the shipment, and one part has been sent in error - the part that they have sent is a pipe that should be a shorter version of itself.  Hopefully we will get it all sorted out tomorrow when the chap we are dealing with is in the office and he will despatch the right parts pronto.There have been 9 eggs laid today, which is brilliant, considering the awful weather - it has been really cold here today and very wet.  I stood in the playground for 10 minutes waiting for the YFG to come out of school - it was raining, cold and truly miserable.  By the time we got home, I couldn't feel my toes and felt chilled right through, so I sat and ate some hot rice pudding, drank a hot cup of tea and put my feet on a hot water bottle - and I soon warmed up! Today I have been clipping recipes out of a huge stack of magazines and then filing them in folders according to the type of food - main meals, cakes, biscuits, puddings, breads, etc.  I have given some of the magazines away, but only the ones that were mostly intact.  The rest have been hurled into the recycling bin.  I have also been walking round and looking at the books on the shelves and I have started a box, in which to put the books that I no longer want so I will have to work out the best place to sell them - ebay, amazon or maybe abebooks, or even greenmetropolis: too much choice!  Chucking the magazines and putting some old home-education books in the box has cleared some space on the shelves already.  Clearing old stuff out is very therapeutic.  The only trouble here is that there is SO much stuff that I should get rid of, and I don't want to just throw it out......"},

What a day I have had today....had to go to the doctor's for a quick blood test, and run a couple of errands whilst I was in town - drop off some DVDs that the FH had borrowed from a friend and pick up the key to the gym for Saturday.  I stopped off at FH's friend's house on the way home and had ten minutes chatting with him and his wife - he has some ducks and they have just started to lay; the first egg was laid yesterday and there were three more this morning.  B was pleased and when I arrived he had just eaten two for his \"brunch\".  When I got home, I saw that my neighbour's mum was in, so I nipped round with some magazines that I had sorted out for her last night - she was pleased, and of course, I was there for a few minutes, chatting away.  Returned home, FH put the kettle on and we had a cuppa and then I picked up a smaller stack of magazines for another friend, but when I got to her house, it was obvious that she had just been crying, so I stayed with her for about an hour and had a chat. This afternoon, I have been taking photos of an old lathe that the FH wants to sell - we aren't really sure of the best place to sell it, and had to spend some time researching the options, and we still aren't that sure! I haven't felt that I have achieved much today, but I suppose that I have done some good in one way or another - someone asked me this morning in one of these chat sessions whether I would like to go to work!  I remember replying that I don't really have time........What have I achieved today at home?  Some laundry, cooked a good dinner with a pudding for a treat, made some bread, looked after the hens this afternoon, picked up the YFG from school and sold two dozen eggs.  I have got some new recipes from the magazines that I need to file, so I am off to do that now, and hope to get some inspiration for meals for later in the month."},

And here are the scones - they have gone down a treat here and I have sent some to school in the lunchboxes today - they are ideal with a little jam.I have been shocked to hear of the terrible events happening in Australia at the moment - floods in Queensland and terrible fires in Victoria, with many people dead and huge numbers of lives wrecked with the homes that have been completely destroyed, indeed, whole communities of homes have been wiped out.  In this country, we are seeing the coldest and snowiest weather for 20 years, whilst in Australia, some parts are suffering from the worst heatwaves in memory.  It makes me stop and think - whatever struggles we are going through here, there is always, always someone with greater challenges to bear.  We have so much to be thankful for in our lives at the moment.The FGs are just enjoying chocolate swirls for breakfast, warmed over in the microwave - they are cinnamon buns without the cinnamon, with chocolate chips to replace it!  The EFG and I spent a happy hour or two on Saturday afternoon trawling through an Australian website's recipes, and we came up with Lemonade Scones.  We picked up the necessary ingredients when we went to the supermarket in the afternoon, and two batches have been made and enjoyed.  The recipe is SO simple - just a cup of cream, a cup of lemonade and 3 cups SR flour - mix together lightly and then stamp out the scones and bake about 10 minutes at 170C in a fan oven.  They rise delightfully!  Photo to follow later when I find the camera.  Each batch made about 16 - 20 mini scones, for very little cost - 40p for the cream, about 5p worth of lemonade and  max 10p worth of flour - so very good value. We had a death in the chicken community yesterday - one of the older girls was having difficulty breathing so we moved her to an isolation pen where she died within the hour.  We think that cold weather had brought on some sort of respiratory illness, as there was no sign of any other illness; she had no sign of the tumour of which we had a hen die years ago, and we have also seen egg bound hens, and she didn't appear to be egg bound either, so we have to chalk it up to experience and let it go.  The chickens are well thought of here, and respected as a part of the lifestyle we have, and their contribution to it, but we have little room for sentimentality with them. Well, the schools are open and the FGs are raring to go.  I have paperwork to organise, calls to make, housework to do and washing to hang, so we had better get going!"},

Her bag was packed before breakfast, and all morning, her refrain was, \"What's the time? Is it lunchtime yet?\" We managed to distract her a little, and then eventually, she had her lunch and it was finally time to go!The EFG and I went to town to do the shopping as I had found another reason to go - the chickens were running out of food, and the FH's car was desperate for petrol.  He tends to run around the village and rarely goes much further, so it was down to me to take it to town and treat it to some fuel!  The EFG doesn't often get to come to the shops with me, so she enjoyed a little potter around, and encouraged a few extra purchases, as she is wont to do, unfortunately.The weather here has been freezing cold, and so the snow that is still here has become incredibly crisp underfoot.  The roads to town are OK although we took it very steadily.  Apparently, we may have more to come, but I have really had enough of it now!!"},
{"title": "Schooldays confusion", "date": "Friday 6 February 2009", "text": "It was one of those, \"Will I?  Won't I?\" days this morning.  We constantly refreshed the website where the local radio station lists the schools which are closed for the day, and our two schools did not appear, so the girls got ready and went off for their day.  The little boy next door was given the day off, though, as we found out that the village school could only manage KS2 children for some reason.I got on with the chores for the day - loaded up the dishwasher, made the beds, got the washing machine busy too, filled both breadmakers with ingredients and got them churning away, etc and then at 11.30 the call came to ask us to pick up the YFG as the school was closing!  Then the FH's cousin was on the phone to say that the EFG's school were appealing on the radio for parents to go fetch their kids, and so I gave them a quick call, to be told that the village children's buses had already left - and sure enough, she walked through the door 15 minutes later!This afternoon, the YFG has had her friend round to play, and they have baked cakes, played in the garden at making an igloo and generally been very busy.  The YFG is going to her friend's house tomorrow for a sleepover, so there were lists to be made too - important stuff to be shared!  Tomorrow evening is going to be quiet here!!Gymnastics has been cancelled for tonight and tomorrow morning as the school where we hold the club was closed today and so we were unable to get in to set the equipment up - and I probably wouldn't have wanted to have driven in there tonight anyway!  We will offer a class the last weekend of half term to compensate for this missed weekend.  I'm glad of the rest - and it will keep me away from the shops tomorrow as we have made it a regular thing to do the grocery shopping after gym on Saturday afternoons.  I don't want to make the trip into town simply for the shopping as I am not buying enough to make the miles worth it, so I will probably hope to manage until next Tuesday when I am going to the smaller town where there is a Co-op.  We will run out of clementines, but we'll be fine!!"},

{"title": "Lots of snow now!", "date": "Thursday 5 February 2009", "text": "Can't believe how wrong I was yesterday!  The snow has really Arrived here now.....we have had about 4 inches overnight, and both of the girls' schools are closed for the day.  They were up and outside at 8.30 playing, came in for a warm up and then went back out at about 10 to play with the 4 year old from next door who was out with his mum.  They have all gone into his house now to play inside, and the FH has hardly moved all morning from his chair by the soon-to-be-fireside: he really wishes he had the fire there on a day like this!I have been keeping him company, making hot breakfasts, keeping children provided with warm, dry clothes at frequent intervals and trying to get the wet ones dry again ready for the next hand over.  I went out and took some photos which I will share later. I think that the breadmakers should probably go on for some cinnamon rolls, and perhaps I will make some traybakes or slices as the baked stash in the freezer is looking seriously depleted."},
{"title": "In between days", "date": "Wednesday 4 February 2009", "text": "The snow has mostly gone, but there are odd patches remaining in the shadows, perhaps waiting for the next fall.  We are supposed to be getting a light covering tomorrow or Friday, so we will be looking out for that.  We have been very lucky here in the Fens that we haven't had any major disruptions: neither of the FGs' schools have had to close, and the amount of snow that we have recieved here has actually been minimal compared to other areas.  Certainly, we haven't had enough for snowmen!  The FH didn't take the girls to band practice on Monday evening but the YFG and I went to gymnastics yesterday - the roads were fine as they had been well gritted.The menu plan worked for Monday and Tuesday but I forgot to get the sausages out of the freezer for the Toad in the Hole today so they are having macaroni cheese instead - it is nice to have the flexibility to move meals around, knowing that we have the basics in the house and have that freedom.  The FH has been to the local Over 60s type group and had a huge lunch there of steak and kidney pie, mash and peas, followed by pavlova and fruit - all for £3.50.  He came home at 2.30 and said that he was full for the day, so I am taking him at his word!  The YFG has her friend here and I will be making the pasta just for the three girls as I can't eat it.  Not sure what I will be having yet.......At the rate I am going, I will need to keep more hens from the second batch of growers for egg laying - I already have customers who have eggs regularly, but now I have someone wanting 2 dozen a week and another lady wanting a dozen regularly, so now is the time for the girls to step up production!!The seed catalogues are coming through the post several times a week now, and I am just itching to start on the garden.  I wish that the weather would clear up and get round to more Spring-like weather so that we could at least get the ground dug over ready for the plants.  We have no real need to buy seeds from the catalogues as we bought so many at a very reduced price at the end of last season, but it is interesting to glance through the leaflets and see what else we might grow.  I intend to grow many more beans (French/dwarf) than we grew last year, and more salad.  I am also hoping that the fruit trees which we bought last year may begin to produce fruit - albeit only a few pieces, I realise!  I still don't have the fruit bushes that I want so I will continue to think about those.  I really want a red gooseberry as I LOVE jam made from those fruits! We have had a setback regarding the wood burner as the flue was going to be delivered on Friday but today there has been a call from the company who are delivering it saying that it will be delayed until the 11th February as the container has been delayed somewhere.  I have no idea where it is being shipped from in the container, but we just wish it would get here!  And speaking of deliveries, I have ordered a book!  The first since before Christmas.....it is a copy of John Wesley's Forty Four Sermons, which I have decided to get so that I might understand the Methodist way a little better.  It has been dispatched from Amazon, so hopefully it might get here before the weekend."},
{"title": "Snow", "date": "Monday 2 February 2009", "text": "We have snow in the Fens today - there was a good covering this morning when we got up, but then it had mostly melted away by about 11.30.  However, I know that more is forecast for the day and it is indeed snowing again right now.  The chickens are not sure what to make of it, and some are staying in their house and only coming out to eat and scarper back in again as fast as possible!  They have still managed to lay half a dozen eggs this morning, though, so I am pleased with that, as I thought that the freezing temperatures might put them off.I did sort out the menu plan for the week and here it is:Monday - leftover roast dinner from yesterdayTuesday - Home made soup and toasted sandwiches, puddingWednesday - Toad in the Hole, veg and mashThursday - Vegetable stew with dumplingsFriday - Corned beef hashSaturday - Sausage plait with baked beansSunday - Roast chicken, potatoes, parsnips, etcThe Sausage plait is on the menu for Saturday because I will need to buy some puff pastry when I do the shopping.  I have everything else that I need for the week already to hand, so that means no need for shopping all week - hurray!The snow is forecast to fall more heavily this afternoon and at \"rush hour\" so the FH will decide later whether to take the girls to band practice tonight - the main roads will be clear, but we have four miles of little roads to get us to the main road and those are the roads which do not get as much grit and may well be dangerous - especially if the melted snow freezes tonight and forms ice.  I will have the same concerns about going to gymnastics tomorrow evening - I don't mind driving there at 3pm, it is the return journey at 8.15 pm that I worry about.  I really don't like driving in these conditions and will avoid it if I possibly can!"},
{"title": "Family weigh-day", "date": "Sunday 1 February 2009", "text": "Well, the FH has stayed exactly the same and I have lost half a stone.  That doesn't actually put me any further down the scale as most of it is the weight I put on over Christmas!  Now I am just a little below what I was and can hope to move further down.  Trouble is that I have been this weight before, and I get stuck here - I know that I have been here for over a week already and the scales haven't dipped any lower - so I will have to up the ante a little in terms of exercise, I think, to get it moving!  The trouble with the FH is that he just loves to eat - and hates to exercise!  I think that a serious cutting down of his portions might be in order this month."},
{"title": "Chickens on the run!", "date": "Saturday 31 January 2009", "text": "The chickens escaped from their run today as the door latch became unfastened and they made a break for freedom.  They looked so lovely striding about in the grass together that I thought I would take some photos.  This one shows the Silver Sussex cockerel with a couple of the hens. This is them attacking the broad beans, which is the point at which we had to chase them back into their run!The larger white bird in the middle of this is the turkey who is living happily amongst the hens.Here is the cockerel again with more of the hens - 10 of them laid eggs today so I am very pleased with them!   To the left of the cock is an Orpington hen and to the right, a Buff Sussex.  The white ones are the Sasso breed that we originally bought for meat and then decided to keep a few (well, five!) of the hens for egg laying. The quail haven't caught on to the egg laying idea yet, but I am living in hope.  Snow is forecast here for tomorrow and Monday so it was great for the chickens to enjoy the sunshine whilst they could as I don't think that they will enjoy the snow as much!Yes - we made it to the end of the month and stayed within our budget!  It has proved to me that I can stay away from the shops and really stick to my aims when I get organised but it helps enormously that I have this blog and I know that people are reading it and I am trying to be accountable to you - and be honest! I did spend a little money today but only £5.92 on an ox tongue and that was an accidental spend: my neighbour's father wanted an oxtail from the butcher who comes to the market in the nearby town but they don't carry them and he had to order one to collect this week.  When M was telling me, I said I wondered whether they had tongues and she said she would find out for me - well, I was absolutely delighted when she actually brought me one home!  Sliced tongue is horrendously expensive in the supermarket and I have stopped buying it, but home cooked and pressed tongue is delicious.  It is a while since we have had one - a couple of years probably - but I am really looking forward to cooking this tomorrow afternoon and then pressing it overnight.  The £5.92 is well within the £11 odd that I had left, so we have achieved our aim.So what shall we do for February? More of the same, I think.  I have restocked the cupboards, at a cost of about £92 from Asda, and so I am giving myself the same £100 again for the weekly shopping over the month.  That will mean that we are spending no more than £200 for the month - about £50 a week, or £12.50 per week per person.  This will need me to continue baking bread, using fruit and veg from the freezer - we have loads left - and keeping a sharp eye on snacking foods; Oh for the days when the children were preschoolers and had three meals, two snacks and a biscuit at bedtime - some days when we are in and out, we seem to be eating at some strange times of the day, and I am sure that people are eating the wrong kinds of things - snacks will have to be more basic because I am not going to start buying rubbish and crisps again: the month has proved that they can do without, and so they will.  I am also not buying things like ice cream when the temperature is only 2 degrees outside - we are going to be eating more in tune with the seasons so we'll save the ice cream for summer!My menu plan for the month ends tomorrow so I will plan the next two weeks' worth of meals tomorrow, based around the foods we have and the plans we have for the various days.  I will share that with you soon.  Tomorrow is also family weigh-day so we will see whether the FH and I have lost any weight....."},
{"title": "Wednesday blues!", "date": "Thursday 29 January 2009", "text": "The YFG had a day at home yesterday with a cold; she could cope with the cold but the problem was the severe headache she was getting from her sinuses.  A day of pampering was in order - some breakfast eaten on the sofa snuggled under a duvet, cuddling Mum!  Then watching a favourite DVD for an hour or so, some lunch - macaroni cheese, her favourite - a neighbour dropped by for a recipe and a chat, and then she did some painting with the FH.  Soon after that, the EFG was home from school and things soon dropped back into the normal after school and evening routine. The hens laid seven eggs between them yesterday, although they have been less productive today! I have put a good layer of straw down for them in their runs, so this afternoon they were ecstatic, scratching and pecking away and really enjoying it!  The weather is forecast to be dry but cold for three days, so I am hoping that the mud will dry out a little for them. Thinking about the \"reduce, re-use, recycle\" mantra, I wanted to share my washing powder ideas.  There are better ideas out there but this is what I am using at the moment.  To start with, I use less that the recommended amount whenever I can; the manufacturers obviously have an interest in the consumer using more of their product, so I take their instructions with a pinch of salt.  I used to use normal washing powder, usually a supermarket own-brand product.  After some reading, I have now got a mixture going which is working very well - the clothes are clean and fresh so aim achieved!  I mix together two bags (one kilogram each) of washing soda with a big box of Tesco Value biological washing powder (the last one cost £1.41 although it has probably gone up since then) and a big box of the own-brand powder.  All this is mixed together in an old insulated cool box which my father threw out.  I use this because it is big enough to hold all the powder and it has a tight fitting lid.  One batch of this mixture lasts about six months, so it is quite a saving on my past usage of normal powder.   I know that other people use vinegar for fabric softener, but I am using some watered down cheap stuff and will maybe try the vinegar when that runs out - or maybe just go without!Using less than recommended is a valuable exercise - it can be applied to all sorts of items from washing powder as I said, to shampoo and toothpaste!  Another similar challenge is to mark the date that a box or package of something is opened actually on the pack and then to work out how long that pack has lasted and try to make the next pack last longer.  All these little ideas build up to a big sense of achievement if successful and having something to aim for makes all the difference sometimes when dealing with relatively mundane chores!The FH and I had a good sort out of the freezers this afternoon.  There are loads of bags of frozen apples, plums, green beans, tomatoes, some bags of peas, asparagus, broccoli, blackberries, homemade ratatouille and soup made from scratch and just frozen.  There is some meat but less than usual.  In the smaller freezer, I keep my homemade bread and baked goods, of which there are plenty so no baking needs to be done this week. As to the eating from stored food challenge and only spending £100 for the month, I feel that I have achieved it.  I have not spent anything on groceries since the last update earlier in the week, but I have done an online order from Asda to restock the cupboards.  This will be delivered tomorrow, which is before the end of the month, but there were several really good offers which expire on the 31/1 so I couldn't wait until February as those would have been unavailable.  I took my time and loaded the virtual trolleys in the Asda and Tesco websites with as near as possible the same items - it took me an hour last night as the Asda website was slow - but it was worth it as it was about £11 cheaper in Asda.  This will be my first Asda delivery so I will see how it goes in terms of quality and service, but I am pleased with the prices."},
{"title": "Saving", "date": "Tuesday 27 January 2009", "text": "Saving what?  The YFG noticed on the back on my copy of The Tightwad Gazette that it had the headline \"Save money! Save time! Save the environment!\" and we had a little chat about all that.  We don't completely agree with the sentiments of the author, though, as saving money and the environment sometimes do take up time, so we didn't completely understand the time savings idea.It is very true, however, that saving money does contribute to helping the environment; many of the things we do to save money are contributing to us using less energy and leaving a smaller carbon footprint.  In the long run, we should as a family consider whether spending money is a good idea when the only reason for spending it is that we have it available to spend!  Double dutch?  I hope not.  What I am saying is that even when saving money is not the prime objective, we should still consider our priorities more carefully. As to saving time, well, I don't know.  Making bread as opposed to picking it up with the shopping doesn't save me time, but it saves me money and gives me the huge satisfaction of being able to feed my family wholesome food without additives, which is a priority.  Stockpiling food does save me some time as it greatly reduces the amount of time I have to spend in the shops - walking around the supermarket and picking up four cans of tuna once a month is a lot less time consuming than travelling there every week and picking up one can each time with the shopping.  By cutting back on the journeys we make, we do save some time - but this is only really valuable if we use the time saved to our benefit; using the time saved to knit/sew/make jam/do something with the children is beneficial - spending it sitting like a vegetable in front of the TV is not (and yes, that is me being judgemental - TV is one of the biggest time wasters out there!)I don't think that anyone has ever claimed that saving money was an easy thing to do - it involves making different choices, and maybe learning new skills, adjusting to different ideals, and focusing on particular goals.  The trouble is that people who are new to economising hope that there is somewhere a switch which can be flicked to put them in moneysaving mode, expert in all the tips and tricks, and money will instantly start building up in the bank.  It doesn't work like that, and so it is the people who live like this in good times as well as bad who understand that the true benefits take longer to accrue.  Skills need time to be perfected, knowledge has to be learned, and networks of suppliers have to be found for cheaper goods, gardens have to be dug and seeds sown - all this takes time and preparation before the benefits are seen.  Sometimes it takes months.  Knowing that the tough times can be outridden is a security that I wouldn't want to give up, and living from one payday to the next is a position I would hope never to have to find myself.  We have lived as a family in this way for about 16 years, and remember seeing my mother and grandmother do all sorts of things that saved in the long term, from home baking and jam making to darning and making clothes at home."},
{"title": "Catching up!", "date": "Sunday 25 January 2009", "text": "I seem to be a day or two behind myself on here at the moment.Some of the cinnamon buns made it to the freezer on Friday, although several got eaten! One bag was brought out and defrosted in the microwave this morning for a quick but substantial breakfast. We don't eat much cold cereal here - the EFG only seems to like an expensive, too sugary confection which I won't buy regularly, the YFG only eats dry cereal and then only picks at it, so all in all it is not a good choice for breakfast here. Toast is often the choice, mostly just with butter, but occasionally with a swipe of chocolate spread over it; the YFG prefers pancakes, and will occasionally ask for a \"salad\" which is what she calls a plate with a little heap of cubed cheese, maybe some ham, a cut-up apple, and perhaps a biscuit on the side. Cinnamon buns are a popular breakfast choice so it is great to have a stash in the freezer so that I can serve them when they are requested, or when I don't have time to offer pancakes. The EFG will sometimes choose scrambled eggs with some toast, which is never a problem as we have always got eggs. The FH likes porridge, but the girls hate it! Thinking outside the box is a way of saving money when the accepted norm of cold cereals for breakfast is not necessarily cheap, and quite often not a particularly healthy choice. Some of my offerings do have fat and sugar, but there are no E-numbers, additives and preservatives, and I know exactly what is in everything that I make, so I count that as a benefit. I also prefer that what they eat in the morning has a little protein in it, so that helps to keep them going till lunchtime - which is OK at 12 for the YFG but the EFG has to go through until 1.20 before she eats lunch.After gymnastics yesterday, the YFG and I went to do the shopping. The groceries came to £28.74 for the week, bringing the total for the month so far to £88.58. Again, it was mostly fruit and vegetables: grapes for lunchboxes, apples, clementines, cabbage, broccoli, plums; some meat - ham, sausages and chicken thighs as the stocks of meat in the freezer are nearly exhausted; cheese; stuffing mix (the girls just discovered this and love it but I should really be making it from scratch so this is the last time I buy it!); and squash to drink.   Broccoli is expensive compared to other green vegetables at £2.19/kg, but we eat a lot of it because it is a valuable member of the cruciferous veg family, famous for cancer-fighting qualities, and we all like it.  Cabbage is our second-best alternative which we eat several times a week, but sprouts are not enjoyed by all the family although we have loads of them in the freezer.  They get eaten by the EFG and FH.  Cauliflowers are expensive and we don't really rate them particularly so we rarely buy them.  We do grow other green veg in the summer, and love green beans, in season as well as from the freezer.This month's challenge of living from the stores has been a good one - not quite over yet, but the finish line is now in sight. I have £11.42 in hand for the rest of the month - only 6 days, and I doubt that there is anything that we will need, although I will record any spending from that. The stores are doing OK although I will begin to make a list this week for re-stocking the shelves. It looks at first sight as if it is the tinned goods that have taken the hardest hit - the chopped tomatoes are all gone, there is no soup left, and the tinned fruit is reduced (but we still have peaches, pears and pineapple). However, we have our own tomatoes in the freezer that can be used in place of the tinned ones, and there is carrot and parsnip soup also in the freezer, as well as bags and bags of cooked apples!We have not bought any books, shoes, clothing (apart from the tights for YFG and a school sweater for EFG), stationery, stamps, DVD/entertainment-type \"stuff\", magazines, toiletries, chocolate or crisps (much to YFG's disgust!). It has made me realise how easily money can be wasted on things which are really not necessary and could be cut out from the regular shopping and just allowed as very occasional treats.I have today made some dough in the bread machine for rolls for tea - which are proving right now on the cooker top - it is still warm in the kitchen from the dinnertime cooking. Whilst the oven was on earlier for the chicken, the YFG and I made some cheese scones. These are excellent as she loves them and will happily eat them at breakfast time, split and warmed in the microwave and then spread with a tiny bit of butter, but she will also want to have them in her lunchbox, so they are versatile. We made about 20, so 10 went into a tin in the cupboard and the others went into the freezer in two packages. The only downside to them is that they used up half the cheese that I had bought for the week, so the usual cheese sandwiches in the lunchboxes may have to be varied this week when we have used it all up - and the FH is rather a cheese fiend! When the oven goes on to bake the rolls, I will also quickly make up a batch of muffins so that there are some for tea and some for the freezer to call upon later in the week.We have eaten the last home-grown chicken from the freezer for lunch, so the FH has been eyeing up the next batch. They are getting to the right age for butchering now, but they are not really fat enough to be a decent meal yet. It is possible that they will take another few weeks before they are ready to eat, and we should probably start increasing their rations (not that they are not well-fed now already!)."},
{"title": "Baking day", "date": "Saturday 24 January 2009", "text": "Yesterday morning, I set the breadmachines going pretty early. The smaller machine was making an enriched dough, which I use to make cinnamon buns. Here is the dough when it has finished rising in the bread pan, and is ready to be turned out, kneaded again and shaped. When the dough is nearly ready, I prepare the cinnamon sugar mixture, which is just a tablespoon on soft brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon, well mixed together. The dough comes out and it is a fairly heavy, dry dough, so it is quite clean to work with and doesn't stick all over me or the worksurface. I knead it for a good few minutes.After kneading, it is time to roll it out flat.I brush it with a little water so that the sugar mixture sticks to the dough when I roll it out. The sugar is sprinkled over the dough and then the dough is rolled up from the longest side.It ends up looking like this and it really doesn't matter that the ends are not even!Now the roll has to be cut into slices, which are quite thin. Once cut up, the slices are laid in an oiled baking pan, touching each other - squeeze them in! I leave them to rise in the kitchen for as long as it takes - anything from half an hour to two hours depending on the warmth of the room. They look like these below when they are risen.Then it is time to bake them. I put them into a 160C fan oven for about 15-20 minutes, until they are golden brown. Then I brush them over with a tiny bit of maple syrup to add some glaze and a little more sweetness. It certainly makes them look appealing! The ingredients that I use are:1lb strong bread flour, half a teaspoon salt, 4 tablespoons caster sugar, 4 tablespoons oil, 2 eggs beaten together with 6 fl. oz milk, and one sachet fast-action yeast. This is all put in to the breadmachine and put on the \"Dough\" setting.  Thanks for this recipe go to D&DD on the forums at http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/ who has a fantastic recipe for an Apple Braid, for which these ingredients form the basis. That recipe uses cooked apple, which doesn't go down well here, so I use the same basic idea to make the dough for the cinnamon buns - which go down extremely well."},
{"title": "Restful day", "date": "Thursday 22 January 2009", "text": "I am getting over my cold from which I was suffering last weekend, but I appreciated having quite a restful day today.  Instead of rushing around, I pottered and purposely didn't make myself a list of things to do.  Lists are brilliant but sometimes they nag at you, and I wasn't in the mood for nagging today!  I watched some TV, loaded up the washing machine and hung up the laundry when it was done, prepared a lovely chicken casserole for the evening meal, and phoned my aunt for a chat.  The dinner was eaten early tonight at about 5pm, and everyone has now had a bath and is getting ready for bed - the FH and girls are watching TV until about 9pm and then I think that we will all be off to bed!  Hopefully my get-up-and-go will return tomorrow!Today has also been a \"No Spend Day\", which is good; the hens have laid eggs again, and I have organised the sale of a dozen and a half to school staff which I will deliver in the morning.  The treadmill has been in action - I have done 15 minutes at 3 mph, whereas the FH managed 2 minutes (compared to yesterday's one!) at 1.5 mph - he complains about his legs aching very quickly...The wet and windy weather which was forecast has been and gone, and we are now in a window of drier weather until the next low pressure system moves in tomorrow and over the weekend.  The greenhouse is OK so far, but I am keeping my fingers crossed.  The poor chickens need some more straw in their yard, so I will have to get them some at the weekend, as they are getting rather muddy."},
{"title": "Wet and windy weather warning", "date": "Wednesday 21 January 2009", "text": "Sorry that I haven't been here this week much.Monday was supposed to have been \"Blue Monday\", the most depressing day of the year, according to the BBC Breakfast team. I can't say that I agreed - why should one day in the year be more depressing? Perhaps some people are experiencing angst over the post-Christmas credit card bill? January is not a bad month, although I hear some people moaning about it, but it is like all things, the more you moan about something, the worse it gets. Look forward to the spring, get the gardening books out and make plans for planting, find some leaner recipes to try after the rich food of Christmas and you won't have time to get depressed.Just have to share a quote I saw somewhere yesterday, but unfortunately I can't remember the exact words, nor to whom it was attributed but it is too good not to share. The gist of it is that we in the developed world have nothing to complain about, because we have all won the lottery in life just by being born in a developed nation. That is so true, and I think I should remember to be grateful more often.Big news - the hens laid 7 eggs between them yesterday so production is beginning to step up. Only three have appeared today, but I guess that they won't crank them out regularly just yet when they are only beginning to lay. It is exciting though! The other news is that the treadmill I ordered on New Year's Day has arrived. The box is large enough to launch as a small boat, and it weighed in at nearly 9 stone in the packaging, so it is a heavyweight and won't get moved around the house now that it is in position. We have set it up and all of us have had a quick go. The FH is going to have to build his stamina up over time as he was out of breath after only a minute at the slowest speed, whereas the YFG has been jogging!Forecasters are warning of very heavy rain between now and the weekend coupled with gales, which may bring trouble! I hate rain as it makes the garden into mud, and the wind might damage my greenhouse so I am a little worried abut this forecast and hoping to get through to the weekend unscathed.The budget is holding up nicely - we are at the 21st today so there are just 10 possible spending days left in the month, and we have spent just £59.84 on replacing groceries and buying fruit and vegetables. I have successfully not spent anything since doing the shopping on Saturday, and I am planning ahead for this Saturday so that I buy only what is needed and nothing more. The stocks in the freezer and pantry are steadily decreasing but there are no huge gaps appearing yet. The meat in the freezer is getting to the interesting stage - I can't do the meal plans without first checking what is actually out there whereas normally I would know that I could plan something from our regular repertoire of meals and be reasonably certain that the meat was available. Makes life more of a challenge! The menu for this week and next is in the previous post's photograph of the chalkboard. We are sticking to it, as it makes life so much easier to have it all planned out.I have had two days of paperwork and planning, interspersed with bread making, gymnastics, helping with homework, ironing and laundry. The FH is making progress with the multifuel stove, and I will take a picture of that ASAP as it is beginning to look right. The external pipework for the metal chimney has been ordered today and should be here in two weeks' time as there is a backlog of orders at the suppliers due to increased demand. Obviously we are in tune with a lot of other people - that makes a change!!"},
{"title": "Photocall day", "date": "Sunday 18 January 2009", "text": "This morning I enjoyed a lie-in whilst the FH took the girls to church, then whilst they were gone, I had a lovely bath, got some plums for my breakfast, and started on the chores - hanging washing was first on the list. The weather today has been dry and bright after a terribly squally night - a lot of wind and rain.When the FH brought in the eggs this lunchtime, one of them was cracked. We have a theory that one of the hens is expelling the egg at high speed, and then it cracks when it hits the nest box - but perhaps she is just choosing the nest box with the thinnest layer of straw. Anyway, we are getting a cracked egg a few times a week, and that has to be removed from the shell and put in the fridge to be used as soon as we can. Usually, that means the next morning's breakfast. This egg is the freshest I've photographed as it was still warm from the nest box. This is the meal plan for the next two weeks. We are continuing with our minimum spending on groceries, using up what we have in the pantry and freezer. This menu is a combination of what we have left that I can make without buying anything like meat or pasta, for example. Yesterday I bought broccoli, cabbage, apples, clementines, honey and instant mash. The instant mash is used for a kind of bread dough that keeps in the fridge for up to 5 days, so that you can just use a little at a time. I use it to make cinnamon buns, breadsticks, bread rolls, etc but I find it a bit heavy to make actual loaves of bread. These two girls were just looking out when I passed by - in an earlier photocall last year, there were three white girls, but one of them died just before Christmas, and we don't know why. However, these two are looking fit and healthy and continue to put on weight.And last, these are new pictures of the quail. The FH cleaned out the house this morning and gave them some more straw and they absolutely love it - they are making themselves deep nesting holes to rest in, and having a great time. Quail are ground-living birds and love to get under things, so this straw is just the business for them - they dived right in and hid themselves away! We haven't had any eggs from them yet, but we are hoping that as the days are lengthening, the eggs will soon come!"},
{"title": "Snuffling through the day...", "date": "Saturday 17 January 2009", "text": "When I woke up this morning, I felt awful - my throat felt like razorblades and I had a blocked nose and a headache! Not a recipe for success, I have to say. I struggled through, got the YFG up and we went to gymnastics. I did take my pot of honey and a bottle of lemon juice along so that when the other coaches had a cuppa, I could have honey and hot lemon as I am finding that it really takes the edge off the sore throat, and the steam helps the blocked nose too, so I can thoroughly recommend it as a home remedy. I had several cups through the morning to keep me going.After gymnastics, we had a quick trip to Tesco for fruit, veg, cheese and ham, and another jar of honey! I am using a lot this week. I also had to buy a couple of pairs of tights for the YFG so that she can wear her skirt to school - she has been wearing trousers most days but would like to wear her skirts now and then. I promised to buy her tights as along as she commits to wearing them with the skirts at least a couple of times a week.This afternoon has passed in a bit of a blur as I feel that I am half asleep - my head feels fuddled with the cold. I did some washing and hung it, had to nip round for a quick chat with a neighbour, cooked the pizza for tea, helped the YFG with her homework, and here I am now. I feel that I will be heading for bed pretty soon, in the hope that a good night's sleep will do wonders. My uncle is coming to lunch tomorrow, so I will send the FH to church with the girls so that I can have a little lie-in and then prepare the lunch. Hope you are all feeling better than this!"},
{"title": "Sausage plait recipe", "date": "Thursday 15 January 2009", "text": "First today I am going to share a recipe for a sausage plait, which is very popular in this house. I can't eat it because of the pastry, but the FH and girls love it. I serve it with lots of gravy and some baked beans, and it is really filling. It is made from a pack of puff pastry, which I buy and then freeze until I need it. This pack had been in the freezer a while, but it was fine. It cost 99p although I think that the cost has gone up a little since then. It is rolled out and then marked into three columns very lightly with a knife. You can see that the two outer pieces are then cut into diagonal strips which end up doing the plaiting. The sausage mixture is placed on to the central section. This mix is a combination of pork sausagemeat, a finely chopped onion and half a pack of dry sage and onion stuffing mixture, all well combined in a bowl. This costs about £1.60 all together. And then, below, you can see that the side pieces are plaited across the pork mixture, to cover it.Once the plaiting is finished, I brush it all over with a little milk and put it in the oven at 160C for about 35 minutes or until it is cooked.And then it looks like this - gorgeous! This made three generous portions for tea tonight and there are another three smaller portions left over for tomorrow - and they won't be wasted! Apparently it tastes good cold with tomato ketchup on the side. All in all, that cost about £3 max, allowing for the pastry to have increased a little in price, and serves about 6 portions. Apart from making the sausage plait and two loaves of bread today, I have been tied to the computer doing some research for work and it is not the most inspiring thing! My spirits have been cheered by being able to look out of the window and see the rabbits in their hutches, grooming themselves or each other, and watching the stray hens meandering around looking for worms and tidbits! And the cat caught a mouse....."},
{"title": "Glorious sunshine today!", "date": "Wednesday 14 January 2009", "text": "The sunshine is the highlight of my day today as I sit here at the window looking out at washing blowing on the line and hens pecking around in the garden!  It is not even that cold any more although there was a frost this morning and some lovely ice patterns had to be cleared off the windscreen of the car before we went out at 9am.Yesterday was another full day of housework and then gymnastics in the town.  The FH had cooked a lovely meal for when we got home last night at 8.15pm - Tesco Value Fresh Salmon pieces - they are \"Value\" so they are odd sized bits, but they were very tasty as well as being a good price.  He had also cooked potatoes, carrots, broccoli and green beans, so it was a hearty meal - but I was starving so I soon ate mine!  The FGs indulged in lemon curd tarts for their pudding and then they were soon herded up the stairs to begin their preparations for bed, although that seemed to take for ever!  There was a lot of \"I must just do.......\" before bedtime was achieved last night.No spending yesterday at all, and I was pleased with the leftover lunch that I made.  We had had lamb shanks in the slow-cooker on Monday and there was a lot of the gravy left over, which had carrots, parsnips and onions in it, so I blitzed that all up yesterday with a stick blender and then boiled it  for about 20 minutes and it made a really lovely broth type of soup for our lunch.  Not a scrap of that meal was wasted and it made the cost of the two lamb shanks even better value for money.  Comparing the amount of meat on the lamb shanks to that on a piece of \"cheap\" lamb shoulder, I always buy the lamb shanks now as there is a lot less fat and more usable meat.  Plus the house smells gorgeous all day as they cook in the slow-cooker, so that is an added bonus.  One of my neighbours has commented that my house always smells lovely, and welcoming as it often smells of homebaking or the tea cooking!Good news - the YFG found the camera for me last night so I can get the battery charged up and then photographs can return to the blog - that will be good!"},
{"title": "Rather a manic Monday!", "date": "Monday 12 January 2009", "text": "I started the day with a list, so it was good preparation that has enabled me to get so much done today, but the flipside is that I had to have a quick doze on the sofa at 6.45pm for about 15 minutes.I've done some boring paperwork stuff like filling in forms and placing orders for books this morning, and I got all my helpful machines on the go early - the dishwasher, the washing machine, and two breadmakers - one was doing French stick dough and the other did normal white sliced bread dough, but all the bread was actually baked in the oven. Lamb shanks, carrots, onion and parsnips were in the slow-cooker by 8am and were beautifully tender by the time we ate at 5pm. I used up the pastry I made last night, as well as the last half a jar of mincemeat, and made mince pies, coconut tarts, jam tarts and lemon curd ones too! I also made some chocolate brownies for the hairdressing friend, who was pleasantly surprised! The car got booked in for its MOT and all the ironing was put away.The piano tuner has been this afternoon to tinker with the piano - he says that it is still in excellent condition, and he should know as he is the only person who has tuned it at various intervals over the past 32 years, and seen it through several house moves. Its most recent move was to us in December 07, but it is a lovely piano. My dad bought it second hand for £400 when I was just 4 years old. Now the EFG is having lessons at school and practising on it.The FH and girls have been to town this evening, hence the early meal tonight. Band practice ran from 5.45 - 7 for all of them and then the EFG was asked to start working with the main band for an hour from 7-8, so they were later home than they used to be. I had a bit of relaxation time whilst they were out, including a long soak in the bath.The weather has gone from freezing cold and dry to milder and wetter almost overnight! I think I preferred the cold to the mud which has taken over the back garden now. Tomorrow is forecast to be mild, windy and mostly dry, so I may take a chance and hang out some washing. We have an oil delivery scheduled as well, so we have to stay at home for that.The installation of the stove in the lounge has also progressed today - the FH has laid the concrete slab on which it will stand but that involved bringing the wheelbarrow in through the front door and across the carpet so I had to put down mats to protect what I could. It was a bit of a messy job, but I am hoping to be able to clear up the room tomorrow when the concrete has dried. Unfortunately I have mislaid the camera so I can't take photos, and I am so cross with myself as I had it here yesterday and there were so many things that I wanted to take pictures of today. Hope I can find it soon.The only spends of the day have been the subs for the band tonight, and a couple of packets of sweets that I bought this afternoon - not strictly necessary but with all my food restrictions, they help to tide me over sometimes.   That amounts to £6.07 all together.  I paid the piano tuner in cash but I am not including that in the challenge as it is not a discretionary item and it only happens once a year.  This week is looking OK financially as we have plenty of food in the freezer, and in the cupboards; I will have to fill my car up with diesel sometime this week as it is getting low so that will either be tomorrow or Friday when we go into town to gymnastics."},
{"title": "Busy day but happy!", "date": "Sunday 11 January 2009", "text": "The YFG had a friend to stay the night last night, and little M's mother is a hairdresser by trade, so she kindly cut us girls' hair last night when she dropped her daughter off for the sleepover.  None of us had anything major done, but it was good to get it all tidied up as we had overgrown fringes all round!  She doesn't charge us, and she does a great job, so last time she did it, I gave her a box of chocolates, but I don't have any in the house this time and in the spirit of my \"non-spending\" month, I intend to bake her a cake tomorrow and give it to her when I meet her at school at 3pm.I am so excited as this blog got a mention on Rhonda Jean's blog at www.down---to---earth.blogspot.com as she has a fab idea of a \"kitchen table\" scheme.  She will post about once a month on a particular topic and bloggers around the world will contribute what they know about the topic.  Her first kitchen table post last Thursday was about keeping chickens, so I provided a link to an August 08 post about our history of chicken-keeping, and she has included it in her posting.  I read her blog every day and I learn so much from her, although she is in Australia and her seasons are different from ours, as well as her climate so she grows bananas and pineapple in her garden - I wish we could do that!!We have had an important service at church this morning - the annual Methodist Covenant Service in which we re-dedicate our lives to God in the publicity of the service, saying a special prayer, and holding Holy Communion as well.  A lot of Methodists hold this service at this time of year as it marks a new beginning and a new start for the year ahead.  The prayer is a solemn one, and it takes some thinking about.Grandad and MB have also been here for lunch and tea today, and MB has patiently been playing board games with the girls and their little friend for a good chunk of the afternoon.  Now we are back in to Sunday night mode, so the girls have sorted school bags out for the morning, I have started to get the packed lunches ready, and washed the girls' hair for them, and now they are watching some TV before bed, whilst I must get the uniforms ironed!  We have had a lovely day, and hope that all our friends have had a blessed day as well."},
{"title": "More income!", "date": "Saturday 10 January 2009", "text": "After the second load was emptied out of the washing machine this evening, two £1 coins were found in the bottom of the machine!  No one could remember having any coins in their clothing, so the money was put into the purse for the grocery spending - another £2!!  That totals £36 \"found\"!!Despite the non-spending plan for the month, we do have a £100 or so allowance that we are giving ourselves for groceries, and of course, the animals need things too, so there will be a bit of spending there.  I thought I would round things up for the end of the week and record how we are doing with it all.No one is going hungry!  That is the major thing, so we can have a tick in that box.  I am eating plums from the freezer for my breakfast with honey, and the FH is also eating them on his cereal.  We are lowering the freezer stocks of plums - and there are a LOT in there. To date, I have spent £28.65 in the first 10 days of the month.  We are a third of the way through and that is less than a third of the budget, so we are going well.  Most of that has been on fresh fruit and vegetables - we get through a lot of clementines at this time of year, and I have had to spend £6 on a sack of potatoes, as well as £1 on a big bag of parsnips and carrots.  I am going to make it through the week to Saturday before I plan to buy any more fresh fruit or vegetables - we have loads of frozen stuff if we run out of fresh, and we do have some tinned peaches and pineapple that the FGs could eat in their lunchboxes if I packed them in little eatertight (whoops - that meant to say \"watertight\"!!! - I don't think that eatertight would be a good plan!) plastic boxes and gave them a spoon. We are eating good evening meals from the storecupboard - things like pasta dishes, chicken casseroles, corned beef hash, homemade pizza (tonight), roasted chicken (tomorrow), homemade meatballs in tomato sauce with spaghetti, for example.  I will need to make more bread this week, and I may make French sticks or rolls as well as just bread for slicing.  Variety helps.I also sold half a dozen eggs yesterday for 70p so that is a little more to add to the \"change\" savings pot.  And money coming in has been amazing.  Just when I had £50 in my wallet last weekend that was left from Christmas time, and I said that I wanted that to last half the month at least, I found £24 in a little plastic money bag hidden deep in the depths of the rubbish in the bottom of my handbag (it was way down there!) and then just yesterday, I found an envelope that I had been given before Christmas, in another bag, and that had £10 in it!  Doesn't God work in wonderful ways - I am sure that it is His way of saying, \"You look after what you have got, and I will give you more,\" as I am always conscious that we should be good stewards of His blessings.   Amen."},

The FH successfully got the stove yesterday afternoon, so he has started work on the preparations for installing it now. This involved removing the existing fireplace surround and plinth which was there with an electric fire. All that has been taken out, and the 4foot wide pice of plasterboard behind it all had to come down too. Unfortunately, that came down in pieces - and some of them were very small! There was dust everywhere, and it took some cleaning up."},
{"title": "Photos of larder areas", "date": "Thursday 8 January 2009", "text": "These are the photos with which I was going to illustrate yesterday's post, but Blogger was not happy with photos then, so here they are today:This is a small shelved area in our utility room where I keep tinned goods like beans, fruit, fish, tomatoes, etc - and there is a stray pudding left from Christmas there too at the moment. This is also in the utillity and is where I keep the flour that is in storage - it is cooler in the utillity room than in the main house, and so the flour keeps well there.  You can see that I have stocked up and have about 5 bags of bread flour there in pink, as well as the usual plain and SR flours.  I buy the \"Value\" range and have had no problems with the baking, so I don't see the need to pay so much more for premium brands.These are the lower shelves of a tall pantry cupboard in the kitchen.  The higher of the two shelves is where we are keeping the jar of rice as well as various cereals, oats and teabags.  The lower shelf has vinegar, oils, more cereals, and tucked away at the back is my secret baking stash of things like chocolate chips that it suits me to have the kids think I have run out of occasionally as otherwise they would be making choc chip cakes and cookies daily!!This is another section of the the same cupboard where we have the jars and bottles which are open and in use at the top, and the bottom is a storage shelf - there's all sorts in there - I have it all on an inventory so I know what is hiding in the back!Trust Blogger!  This photo at the bottom is actually the top two shelves of that cupboard - more stuff in storage - extras of jam, lemon curd, sauces, icing sugar, cornflour - it's all in there!  And there is more but Blogger seems to only let me do 5 photos per post, so that'll do for today.  You can see from these pictures that we have Loads of food in the house, so perhaps you can understand the motivation now for the \"use-it-up\" idea.    I have no plans for spending any money on groceries or anything else today, but the exciting news is that the FH has gone off towards Swaffham in Norfolk to pick up the multifuel stove that we will be installing.  The brand that we want are rare as hen's teeth just now and there is a 10 week wait if your agent has to put one on order for you - people are waking up to wood heat here now!  Anyway, we found an agent who carries quite a lot of stock and has one there - so we checked the prices online and found that her price is the best around, so he has hot-footed it over there this afternoon to fetch it.  The installation engineer has been here this morning and had a look, given us a price, and we have agreed to let him know when we have a stove for him to install - we didn't think that it would be so soon!  We have loads of wood ready to get started, so we are very keen, especially in the cold weather that we are having, to get this up and running.  I couldn't go with him as I have to pick up the YFG from school at 3pm and she has a friend coming home to play and stay for tea too, so she will be happier tonight - she felt bored last night!"},
{"title": "Well stocked cupboards - home shopping!", "date": "Wednesday 7 January 2009", "text": "January is traditionally a time of year when people worry about paying their credit card bills from Christmas and having quite a financially hard time.  We are not having those worries as we have been budgeting and keeping a good larder.  We work differently from some people in that matter, as we do not shop week-to-week and menu plan before we shop.  Shopping is a little more adventurous for us - I may put on the list that we need to buy \"meat\" if our stocks are running low in the freezer, but I will have a good look in the shops for good deals on meat and will buy whatever is the best value for money.  When I mealplan, I base our menus around the food that we have in the house, or the freezer! In the run up to Christmas, I was making sure that we had plenty of everything that we use regularly in the house - the basics like flour, yeast, eggs, sugar, oils and fats, tinned goods and staples like cereals and oats.  We also have a lot of garden produce in our two freezers, as well as all the batch baking that I have been doing - there are ginger cakes, banana cakes, biscuits and muffins, as well as bread out there.Because I want to sock some money away to save for the treadmill payment (£240) and we are saving to install a multifuel stove in the lounge, I decided that this month, we would only shop from our own resources - our larders and freezers - with only fresh fruit/veg and items that we have run out of being purchased.  I have given myself a budget of £100 for the month, although I hope to spend less than that.  I have averaged it to £25 a week.  Since the beginning of the month to date I have spent £13.46 over the past 7 days.  A lot of that has been on fruit and veg, with two loaves of bread, and some honey and sweet and sour sauce included as well. I have also set a complete moratorium on spending for other reasons - so no magazines, books, clothes, shoes, toiletries, cleaning products, newspapers, gifts (no occasions this month anyway!), no stationery, no stamps. I am lucky in that in all those areas where the item is a necessity like shampoo, I already have stocks in the house - I also have stamps, cleaning products, and stationery in stock so I am sure that we can last the month.  Anything that we \"want\" to purchase is being put on a list at the back of my spending diary.  That has two items on it so far - I need some new wellies but not desperately, and I have noticed that we only have 3 eggcups so we could do with some more of those, but there is no rush.We have some commitments that we would not wish to stop such as our weekly donations to the collection at church on Sunday, and the band subscriptions which are due each Monday when theFH and girls go to the brass band lessons in the town.  There are no fees for gymnastics as I coach on a volunteer basis and so get free sessions for the YFG. I think that you could say that we are having a \"use-it-up\" kind of month - it feels good to be using what we have and being creative with our resources.  We will have to continue to buy the odd thing, as mentioned before, and I will have to put fuel in the car as well, so we cannot stop all spending. And the hens are continuing to lay, so at least I don't need to buy eggs!"},
{"title": "Christmas photos", "date": "Monday 5 January 2009", "text": "A few photos from our Christmas.  These first two are shots of the panoramic Christmas jigsaw puzzle that the FH was largely responsible for completing.  He had occasional helpers, but he did a grand job!  There were 1000 pieces, and it took from Boxing Day to New Year's Eve. And these are the two Christmas cakes I made.  This first one was for my uncle, and we kept the second.  I was so good and made the actual cakes way back at the end of October, but then my good intentions went to pot and I only managed to get the marzipan on them on Christmas Eve and they were iced on Boxing Day in the morning.  It was a good job that we were so full that we didn't want any for tea on the big day!  Boxing Day was the ultimate deadline as we had guests to tea and I thought that my uncle would want to take his home with him - turns out he wasn't going home but staying with my sister and he came back to Sunday lunch and took it home that night.We had never had candles on a Christmas cake before, but this set looked cute and we indulged and bought them.  We felt the need to sing \"Happy Birthday!\" to Jesus, though, and to blow them out before it was cut.  It was a joint effort and seemed to be the best thing to do, otherwise there seemed little point in lighting them!Quite apart from Christmas, the hens have laid more eggs today, and the FGs are all ready for school in the morning - just have to get me prepared for the early starts and packing lunchboxes again!"},
{"title": "Happy New Year - belatedly!", "date": "Sunday 4 January 2009", "text": "Yes, it's 2009 and I haven't been here since goodness knows when, so I had better have a quick run down of what we have been up to.New Year's Eve was fun, as we had some friends round for the evening.  I cooked a big leg of lamb, with all the veggies and then apple crumble or chocolate swamp pudding to follow.  The whole meal was well appreciated, and the recipe for the swamp pudding had to be given to one visitor who is known to be a bit of a chocoholic!  After the meal, we all 7 of us settled down to play one of the YFG's Christmas games - the Game of Life.  There was much hilarity and rolling of eyes, and the game finished only moments before the bells heralded the New Year!New Year's Day started with rather a long lie-in - and to be truthful there have been rather a lot of those this week.......but we had a lazy day and rested up.  Saturday we had to get up early as we went to the cinema.  Now that doesn't seem like a very moneysaving/thrifty thing to do, but hey!  At the Cineworld cinema, they have Movies for Juniors, and all the tickets, adult or child, are just £1 each.  So we took an extra child and it still cost me less than a £5.  We do have to be there for a 10am showing, though, and to continue the moneysaving, we take our own popcorn and juice...So we went to see Wall-e which amazed me in a couple of ways.  First that someone had had the vision to create that scenario where we have made so much rubbish that there isn't room for us on Earth anymore and we have to go and live in space.  The second was that there was virtually no dialogue in the first half of the film, but it didn't seem to matter - it still worked.  The EFG thought that she was going to cry, and it certainly made me think more about rubbish and recycling, and consumerism.  Maybe I'll get back on that soapbox another day.The extra child went home for lunch and the YFG went to her house in the afternoon so that they could do their homework together, but then they both came back and the child stayed for a sleepover - only leaving at 4.30pm this afternoon.  They have spent the entire day making and playing in a den upstairs and have been no bother at all.  It has been rather quiet!  The rest of us have been doing bits and pieces - the FH has finally tackled the mountain of ironing and has been victorious!Excellent news on the poultry front - two of the hens are laying eggs at last!  One of the Barnvelders that hatched in the summer is laying one of the eggs and we have yet to work out who is responsible for the other but we are very excited and hope that the other 14 of them up there will soon start!  We are over the shortest day, and Spring is around the corner, so we are optimistic (well, I suppose anyone who says Spring is around the corner at the beginning of January would have to be optimistic or mad!).  I am also beginning to think more about the garden and what I am going to plant where - had thought of burning some calories today by doing some digging but the ground is frozen solid and I couldn't even get the fork into the ground.The Christmas decorations are down and put away, the FGs are back to school on Tuesday and I have to make some decisions this week about the work that I am going to do this year - and which  company I am going to work alongside.......decisions are not my strong point and I do prevaricate a lot before I do something - and I sometimes say that I will do something and then change my mind!  Looking back at the plans I had for 2008, this blog is one of the more successful of them, but look how long I left it (August!!) before I actually started it - I am often more afraid of starting something than actually doing it!  I have some ideas but this time I am waiting until I have some quiet time when the girls have gone back to school to actually think things through properly. We have made one spontaneous decision this week and ordered a treadmill!  The FH is not getting any lighter, and we could all do with the exercise, and having a treadmill inside the house will remove any and all excuses he has for not going for a walk.  It is due to be delivered around the 13/14th of the month, so we should be seeing less of him by the end of the month!  I have put a few pounds back on over Christmas so I am going to be working hard at losing those again before I head lower back down the scale."},
{"title": "Headache blues", "date": "Tuesday 30 December 2008", "text": "The poor YFG has spent the afternoon suffering from the headache and throwing up so nothing I had planned got done!  She and I had to lay on my bed for huge cuddles whilst she was suffering, and when she recovered, we were able to join the others downstairs for some TV, puzzling and a James Bond DVD.  She has a longstanding problem with eating pork, which I had thought was limited to roast pork/pork chops which I now never serve, but it seems that I may have been wrong.  This morning we were up late and so the FH served a \"brunch\" of bacon, eggs, beans etc for himself and the girls.  Some hours later, the YFG asked if she could have a pepperami, which I usually keep in the fridge for a pizza topping.  It seems to me that the combination of the bacon and the pepperami constituted pork overload and her system said, \"Whoa!\" and threw the lot back.  She slept for a while, then ate some toast at about 4pm which was OK, and then they all had chicken sandwiches for tea at 6pm, and she has been fine.  Her stomach is sore from the actual vomiting, but she is OK.  We had this checked out by the paediatrician a few years ago at the local hospital and she has said that my association with pork cannot be proved but seems to be a probable cause, so I guess we have to be more careful in future - although this is the first such attack she has had for many months.We are enjoying a beautifully crisp, clear winter day here; the sun is shining and there is still a frost in sheltered parts of the garden.  The cat is replete from her breakfast and is sunning herself on top of the wheelie bins, and the two Dutch bantams are pecking around under the rabbit hutches for tidbits which they may have missed earlier!  A vegetable seed catalogue came in the post this morning so thoughts have turned to planting the garden in the spring and which plants to put where.  Before we can get to that, though, there is the small matter of several heaps of horse manure to be dug into the beds - and that needs to be done sooner rather than later.  It will be good exercise, I think - well, that is what I am telling myself!Yesterday, the EFG's godfather and his daughter arrived at about 10.30am.  They came down from Doncaster, where he lives.  His daughter lives in Scotland and was visiting for the holidays.  She will be flying home at the end of the week ready for school again next week.  She is 10 months older than the EFG, and they get on OK.  So, we had a coffee and some chatting whilst the kids played on their DSs together, then we had the baked potatoes and various fillings.  After that, the girls went outside for some fresh air and a bounce around on the trampoline, but it was quite chilly so they weren't out there very long!  It was a good visit and it was lovely to see them again.  They left at about 3 as we had to go out.We had to nip into the town to throw some rubbish at the dump, have a quick scout around Tesco for some fruit and veg, and then a visit to a friend before coming home for tea.  In the evening, I had a bath early and then we watched one of our Christmas DVDs, which was good!Today, I have changed the sheets on my bed and they are in the machine at the moment.  I have to hoover up there and clean the bathrooms, and then I am planning a quick tidy round down here as well.  There will be some ironing to do later, and I have some serious cleaning to do in the utility room which is really messy at the moment, and I am hoping to encourage the girls to tidy their rooms up too - I like things to be clean for the New Year.  The YFG has a headache now so I am not sure that there will be much enthusiasm from her today!  The EFG is pleading homework so I doubt I'll get much help there either!!!  The FH is still doing his puzzle, although he is making good progress so it should get finished this year."},
{"title": "Festivities continue!", "date": "Sunday 28 December 2008", "text": "Christmas itself may be over - hope that you have all had a good one - but the visitors still keep coming!  We had a quiet Christmas Day at home just the four of us, then my uncle came over on Boxing day for lunch, and following closely behind him was the FH's cousin's wife and son who always come for the afternoon and evening on Boxing Day - we started that tradition when we moved to England and hope to continue it yet awhile.  The cousin himself was ill, feeling down with man-flu, so he stayed at home, but we phoned him for a chat so that he didn't feel left out.  On Saturday, we again had a day to ourselves, a time for rest and recuperation, and a quick walk to blow out some of the cobwebs, although it was very cold and clear so we didn't walk very far but we did walk fast so hopefully it burned off a few calories!  Today we have had my uncle back for Sunday lunch, and my cousin and her husband arrived soon after 2pm and have just left.  My uncle is doing a huge jigsaw with the FH but I expect that he will be going home later.There are more people expected tomorrow - the EFG's godfather and his daughter are coming down from Doncaster for a couple of hours for a visit.  They will be here at about 11am, so I am planning baked potatoes for lunch and perhaps then another walk.The FGs have had some lovely gifts that they have really been pleased to receive.  They were given some money which has already been allocated - they are allowed to spend half and half has to go into the bank.  Amazon has already had an order for DS games with the spending money, and there will soon have to be a trip to the bank to put the cheques away.  The YFG has had a couple of board games too, which means that all the visitors have been playing the Game of Life or Monopoly with her - Game of Life looks vaguely familiar to me, so I have been wondering whether I had it as a child, but I am not a huge fan of board games so I don't think it would have been my favourite!New Year is approaching fast - there are only 3 more \"sleeps\" left in the year as we will be awake on Wednesday with friends here for the evening to welcome in 2009.  It always starts me thinking about fresh starts for a new year - I have been thinking more about budgeting this time than losing weight!  Weight loss has always been on the list before, and I suppose that it is still there but not at the forefront of the ambitions for the year.  I have still got a couple of days to think about them so will keep you up to date when I have clarified things in my own head.Just to recommend an author - Alexander McCall Smith has written some excellent books about the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency, set in Botswana - and I bought myself a set of 10 of his books for Christmas.  I had already read the first two in the series, but I have quickly made my way through the third and fourth in the past couple of days and they are excellent!  They seem set in a past era of manners, politeness and respectability which is sadly lacking in this country today, but it heartens one to be able to read about it in such elegant prose.  There are 6 books in that series in my set, and the other four are set in Edinburgh, I believe, around a different set of characters; I have yet to start on them so can't say what they are like, but if they are anything like the Botswana stories, they will be wonderful."},
{"title": "Merry Christmas!", "date": "Wednesday 24 December 2008", "text": "It's Christmas Eve and I am just taking five minutes out to wish you a Merry Christmas! I have just marzipaned the Christmas cakes, one for us and one for my uncle, so they will have to be iced later.  We had a lovely neighbour when we were children who always seemed to be icing her Christmas cake just before she came out to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, so I always think of Jo when I am doing mine, and my mum muttering about last minute things!  The FGs have gone to the Christingle Service at the church with our neighbours, and I will be taking them to our church for the 10am service tomorrow morning. The ironing got done last night, but the DVD player didn't get sorted so the FH has just taken it to a mate's house to see if he can get it working for him!  We are off out at 7pm to a neighbour's house for a Christmas visit, and we have my sister coming with gifts for the girls at some point today as well.  The girls have been and finished their secrets - Fimo jewellery - it looks good! Love to everyone across the seas, and wishing you all a very peaceful 2009."},
{"title": "A Christmas baby", "date": "Tuesday 23 December 2008", "text": "Yes, a Christmas baby has been born to one of the families on the street in the past few days, so welcome to the world, baby Hannah!Apart from that excitement, the FGs have been off to a neighbour's house making secrets, which they have to go back tomorrow to finish, and the baskets of ironing have been finished between the FH and myself.  We made a dash into one of the smaller local towns today to deliver a couple of Christmas cards, a gift to another family, to get some more plasters for my sore finger from the supermarket, and to borrow a stack of DVDs from a friend; the FH has decided that the tv selection over the holiday was going to be pretty dire so he has his own selection now and it includes several Bond films, the Alamo starring John Wayne, a historical account of Oliver Cromwell, which the FH says we should all watch as we live in Cromwell country, and a few other of his favourite detective, Inspector Frost.  The only trouble is that the DVD player is only playing in black and white, so there may have to be some rearrangements of tvs and players in order to watch these in colour.  I wish he would just learn to love reading as the rest of us do and we wouldn't have all this bother...This afternoon, the FGs made cupcakes in the kitchen, and then I was supposed to be doing some Christmas baking but that didn't quite happen as it took them so long to clear up!  I also wanted to watch Ruth Watson's programme called \"Country House Rescue\" about people who own piles in the countryside but have no money for their upkeep and repair - she is remarkably blunt but an astute businesswoman, so if ever I inherit a stately heap, I'll know where to go for advice!"},
{"title": "PS", "date": "Monday 22 December 2008", "text": "The dippy chickens put themselves to bed tonight - hurray!!!!!!!My mother only used to let us put the tree up on the Saturday before Christmas, and I have one dear friend who puts all her decorations up on Christmas Eve.  We finally got around to putting ours up on Saturday, as tradition decreed.  I'll be honest, and say that in the recent past, we have put it up earlier due to the FGs' demands, but the room just wasn't ready this year!  I keep moving things around, and the room has been in turmoil for a week or so.  Even with the tree in place, there are still some baskets of laundry sitting patiently by the ironing board, hoping to get ironed tonight - they can hope - they may get done tomorrow.  I don't do laundry on Christmas Eve, the big day or on Boxing Day, so at least I get a couple of days off!The YFG has just got her face into this shot! It was meant to be showing some of our tree hangings, which I love.  We seem to have a red theme going on, which is accidental.  We do pick up additions to the collection most years, and the pointsettia lights were last year's.  This year we have the red and green stars which we made earlier in the month.Today I have made the orange and coconut cake from Rhonda Jean's blog - and it smells great.  The FH and FGs have eaten some and declared it delicious, but as usual I deviated from the recipe somewhat: coconut milk instead of coconut cream, then I doubled the whole thing, and cooked it in two loaf pans instead of round ones.  I sent one loaf to a dear friend who has recently had her tonsils out and is still suffering - sent with love, so hopefully she will be able to have a taste or two.  I think that recipe will definitely have to go in the book as a \"do again\"!"},
{"title": "Holidays are here at last!", "date": "Friday 19 December 2008", "text": "End of term for the FGs has seen me baking mince pies for teacher-gifts, as well as looking forward to spending more time with them at home. The EFG came home on the bus and arrived at about 2.30 pm so she was able to come with me to fetch the YFG from her school in the village. That was lovely, as some of the staff were able to talk with her and ask her how she is getting on. The FH took the YFG to town for a check up with the optician, so the EFG and I snuggled down to watch \"Miss Potter\" on DVD. The landscapes in that film are beautiful and I found Beatrix Potter quite inspirational in that she used the money she earned from her writing to save so much of the Lake District from development and to preserve a way of life for so many people there. Too many people who make a lot of money don't seem to share the benefits of their wealth in that way. My small donation to the Salvation Army seems rather insignificant compared with her purchases of many farms and huge acreages in Cumbria which made such a valuable difference to so many people.This evening, we have watched some Doctor Who, and I have sorted through some old magazines with a view to throwing some of them out - not something I like to do as I am a hoarder. I also had to go and put the little chickens to bed - they are not used to going into a house at night, and all stood in a huddle near the gate, so we had to go and pick them up one by one and thrust them head-first through the pop hole. The FH is disgusted with their seeming stupidity, but I think that they will get the idea soon - I certainly hope so anyway! The wind is getting stronger here tonight, so I think that they are probably better off inside the house than outside.We are planning to put the Christmas tree up tomorrow so I will get the camera ready to take some photos!"},
{"title": "The chickens have moved house!", "date": "Thursday 18 December 2008", "text": "Today the FH and I have moved the batch of young chicks outside.  They are about 12 weeks old now and fully feathered, so we thought it was time that they had some fresh air.  It necessitated some moving around of the older girls from their house to a different one but all are happily installed tonight, and we will wait and see what they make of it all tomorrow.  The FH is out there now, in the dark, making sure that they have all put themselves to bed in the right places. The weather today has been strangely mild and blowy so I have got some more washing dry.  Whilst that is good news, it has left me with Mount of Ironing to get done!  Tomorrow is the last day of term and the YFG is allowed a non-uniform day, so along with her school Christmas Lunch, that will round off the day for her nicely.  The EFG's school closes at 1.45pm so she will get home earlier than normal, making her a happy bunny too!"},
{"title": "Wow - 100 posts already", "date": "Wednesday 17 December 2008", "text": "Can't believe I made it that far!Today I am unashamedly plugging two websites which represent the businesses of a friend of mine from way back when! We both lived in Cupar in Fife at one time, then I came to the Fens and she went to Denmark for a while. She is now back (and has been for a good few years) in Scotland, but a lot further north in Forres, in Moray. Susan has two businesses herself, running a B&B and a website selling gorgeous bridal wraps and other items brides might need! So, if you are ever in that area and need a place to stay, http://www.forres-bed-and-breakfast.co.uk/ will give you all the information you need. You just need to check out her guestbook and read all the wonderful comments to know that it will be a great place to stay! Her other venture is at http://www.ukbridalstore.co.uk/ and I just know that the items will be of the utmost quality, because I know Susan and her attention to detail.Having had a lazy morning this morning, I am now getting into gear, so I had better get moving so that I can start to cross some items off the chores list for the day. We are enjoying some beautiful winter sunshine here today, and I am about to hang some washing under the verandah in the hope that it will get a bit drier in the sun, even if it doesn't dry completely. The YFG has gone off on her panto trip with the school this morning and was terribly excited, so I hope that it is going well for them. I am looking forward to hearing all about it this afternoon."},
{"title": "Savvy shopping", "date": "Tuesday 16 December 2008", "text": "I had thought, I had hoped, I had prayed that I had done the food shopping!  I vowed not to enter the portals of a supermarket until 2009 - but I had an opportunity too good to miss today.  My cousin's husband works for a huge food processor in Lincolnshire and she takes me with her very occasionally to their staff sales shop - where things are unlabelled, cheap and occasionally out of date.  I spent £32 and got a whole trolleyful of goodies - pickles, Fray Bentos pies (45p!!), spaghetti, jam, lemon curd, pasta sauces, Turkish Delight, tinned biscuits (which I have to confess I bought for the decorative tin and not the biscuits!), Christmas puddings, all sorts of stuff...and now I have it all stashed away in my stores.  I do truly believe that all I need to buy before the end of the year will be the fresh fruit and veg.  Thank goodness!This afternoon when we returned home, I spent a little while curled up on the sofa enjoying watching a film, content in the knowledge that no-one was expecting me to be anywhere for a change!  That slot in the week on a Tuesday afternoon is usually spent at gymnastics, but that finished for the holidays with the party on Sunday, so I have a little more free time, and since I am not feeling 100%, I thought I deserved a rest!These past two evenings, the FH and I have enjoyed watching Nigella's Christmas Kitchen programme, and although the FH loves to watch her, he doesn't ask for many of her recipes as he is always exclaiming about the amounts of butter and cream with which she has such a generous hand.  He fears for his cholesterol just watching.  I love Nigella's use of language - she has such a wonderful command of English and her vocabulary is a lot more extensive than some TV chefs.  Not sure that she wants to be known as a \"chef\" in that sense as I feel that she is more of a home cook who loves to share what she makes for her family and friends with the rest of us.  I did treat myself to her new book, Nigella Christmas, with some WHSmith Privilege Club (Sign up on their website) vouchers - the book was £12.50 but I paid £7.50 with the voucher!  It makes good reading, and I will be trying out some of the recipes next week, I think!  I have been offered the use of my neighbour's empty-ish freezer for some of my home baking, so I can afford to make more now, as the freezers chez nous are full!I have found the ultimate mince pie recipe - and I am not sharing - yet!  I sent some mince pies to church on Sunday morning and one of the ladies caught me in the school playground yesterday to tell me that her husband hadn't stopped talking about them all Sunday afternoon saying that they were the best he had ever had.......I was very pleased to hear that!  It is a real struggle for me as a cook because I am wheat and dairy intolerant, and eating any of either makes me really ill, so I don't, but that means that I rely completely on people's opinions of what I make.  The FH is not a good critic as he loves his food, and was in the RAF where he was told not to criticise food or the cook would \"sort you out\" so he tells me that most things are lovely, never offering any helpful criticisms.  The FGs are OK, except that the EFG will almost eat anything, whereas the YFG can love something one week and \"hate\" it the next, which usually means that she has got bored of it.  Kids!The last of the gifts I had ordered online arrived through the post this morning and are wrapped and hidden away.  I just need a gift for my uncle and my sister now, as I had planned to get them gifts from Lakeland and just left the ordering too late!  I may be able to dash to their shop in Peterborough or I may just look elsewhere this week.  I have a tradition of giving the FGs a Christmas Eve book, which they are allowed to open in the evening and then are hopefully interested enough to spend some quiet time reading.  Each year, I hope that this will give them a calm space in the midst of the sea of anticipation which threatens to overcome most children on Christmas Eve!  Some years it works, others are not so successful.  I have yet to choose the books this year, and I am looking forward to a quiet half-hour in my favourite bookshop in town to search out the perfect gifts for them.  That may well happen on Friday."},
{"title": "Christmas parties", "date": "Monday 15 December 2008", "text": "Yesterday evening we held the Christmas parties for the children at the gymnastics club.  The younger children attended between 6 and 7 and then the older ones from 7.15 to 8.45pm. Having them in two batches was supposed to be a means of spreading the work out, and not having too many there at once but the best laid plans and all that - we had 20 kids at the first party and 60 at the second - whoops!  All in all, it went well and the children enjoyed themselves.  The little ones played pass the parcel, had a lot of dancing and then ate a little, then we judged their fancy dress and they danced some more - their hour flew past.  The winner of the fancy dress was Mrs Christmas....she was just so cute.  At the second gathering, the children were more boisterous but in good spirits, and had a great time doing all the dances.  The winner of their fancy dress was a girl dressed up as Zebedee from the Magic Roundabout, complete with an enormous papier-mache head, and a spring for bouncing, of course.  We took some lovely photos, and the kids all went home exhausted...Today has been a day when I have been trying to get things done before Friday when the children break up from school.  Traditionally, I have had to barricade myself in to a room late on Christmas Eve so that I could wrap the gifts, but I have done it ALREADY and I am SO pleased.  It took me all afternoon, but it is such a relief to have finished.  I also wrapped a couple of gifts that had to be posted, and duly sent them off to Scotland, slightly worried about this proposed postal strike on Friday as I don't know exactly which sorting offices are going to be affected and whether my parcels might need to go via any of them.I am desperately trying to get the laundry baskets emptied but I am hampered (no pun intended there, sorry!) by the weather, so it is draped around on the airers again, and only two loads done so far - more tomorrow.  Had a lovely hour sorting a storage cupboard out and cleaning the shelves, including making an inventory of what I have got in there - and boy, did I need to!?!  Five big boxes of icing sugar, five jars of raspberry jam - I think I need to keep better tabs on what I have got in stock!I hope that I don't offend anyone, but I am going to say what I think about Christmas lights now.  They have a place - in town centres, lighting up the communal space for everyone to enjoy.  I can live with that, and I sort of see why the powers that be do that.  I am not so happy about the untidy slew of lights that adorn various houses in the vicinity.....some of them look OK, but some look awful, and there seems to be some kind of competition between people to have the most which degenerates into who has the tackiest show.  There are some tasteful displays but they are few and far between.  Light pollution, excess use of electricity, I sound like a terrible old fogey (well, I am practising for when I AM one!) but hey, the only light Jesus had was a star over that stable, and He managed OK.......Got to go as the YFG has been practising the Nativity story with some cardboard cut outs and wants me to watch her acting it out."},
{"title": "Christmas tree decorations", "date": "Thursday 11 December 2008", "text": "Here they are - little stars of red or green felt with contrasting circles attached with a sewn-on button, with a piece of hanging ribbon attached.  The YFG and I made these last night, and I am pleased with them.  I want to make a few more, but I ran out of red ribbon (because the YFG wanted some for her hair...mmm!) and red buttons, so I shall have to pick up some more on Saturday afternoon. They are not exactly an original idea - they are based on an idea from the Usborne Christmas Things to Stitch and Sew book although we did not follow the instructions there completely.  There is a bit of Fen license there too.  The EFG is making a snowman from some very pale lilac cotton, and is waiting for me to thread the bobbin and machine with some suitable coloured thread for her, so I hope to do that tonight.  She has gone with the FH and YFG to the town where she is playing Christmas carols with her cornet in the band and the FH and YFG are supposed to be supporting them by handing round the collection bucket, so I hope that they are not too cold.  I am doing my part by cooking the supper for them when they get home!There are so many people out there who just don't!  What am I talking about?  Well, I am continuing yesterday's thoughts about debt, I suppose.  There are families who don't have the same priorities as mine, and I don't understand how they are so blase about the levels of debt which they are accruing.  I don't \"get\" how they just continue to spend, spend, spend on things which are unnecessary luxuries, whilst they are not paying their dues in the mortgage and council tax, for example.  They obviously don't \"get\" my ideas, either, so I guess that we are even, but I am convinced that mine is the right path. Let's be clear - there are some kinds of debt which are OK.  Mortgages are reasonable, but I would still urge people to overpay as much as possible so that they are clearing the debt as fast as possible.  Student debt is also understandable, in some cases, as long as it is not extreme; some students seem to have an incredibly responsible attitude and work jobs as well as studying to minimise their debts, but others just seem to believe that a student loan is there to be spent and hey, it has a long pay-back period, so let's spend it!  This is also a kind of debt which I would advocate getting paid off as quickly as possible.  Why have millstones hanging around your neck if you can possibly be free? The way to live on a small income is to be positive and to see everything as a challenge, and to try to beat the system!  I have been properly diagnosed with depression in the past on two occasions, but then I changed the way I thought.  Instead of dwelling on my problems and concentrating on how miserable life felt (and I say \"felt\" rather than \"was\" as it was only my interpretation of how my life was panning out at the time) I read an excellent book by a doctor called Richard Carson, and it told me to stop thinking, basically!  Stop thinking about the things that are making one miserable and act, do something, keep busy, keep your mind occupied and achieve!  I now refuse to let miserable thoughts enter my head, find something positive in all situations, and keep smiling!  Hey, I lose it sometimes, but the essential underlying attitude that I hold is a Positive one.This means that when I go shopping and buy things that are cheaper versions, I am positively glowing at the thought of having cheated the supermarket out of the premiums I would have paid on more expensive items - I love buying things from charity shops because I am benefitting the environment by recycling, and the charities are getting revenue as well - growing my own veggies is brilliant because it saves us money, gives us exercise and gets us out in the fresh air, and we spend time together doing the garden - and baking is very satisfying when I consider the cost of the same items in the supermarket, and that I am eliminating so many additives from the family's diet by being on top of the ingredients, so to speak, by knowing what is in the food.  Establishing a budget and making changes to accomodate it is empowering, and staying within my own imposed budgetary limits is very satisfying.  See frugality as a challenge, work out how to achieve your aims and feel the buzz when you get there - and if you don't, there is always next month! Set aims as well, so that you can see that you are making inroads into the debt, if you have it, or perhaps a chart to show how much you are saving - and save FOR something.  We always have a little holiday fund that I make payments into each year for a few days away and days out in the holidays - and it gives me enormous pleasure to see that increasing. Getting pleasure from something or avoiding pain are the greatest motivators in life, apparently, and I work well with both.  Being in debt would cause me enormous pain, in terms of stress and worry, so I avoid it like the plague.  Avoiding it by taking the measures I have outlined as well as others, means that I get pleasure (and relief, and peace of mind) from not being in debt.  The people that I mentioned in the opening paragraph who are in debt and still spending unwisely are, to me, getting too much pleasure from the spending that they are enjoying, and the debt is not yet causing them enough pain.  Unfortunately, the times we have ahead of us mean that when that pain comes, it may well be very great.  Now is the time to stop, think and reassess life, and one's priorities........I think that I will go back to normal life tomorrow and share a couple of recipes!"},
{"title": "Sewing and Christmas trees", "date": "Wednesday 10 December 2008", "text": "Yes - I have finally got the sewing machine that I bought at the beginning of November out of its box and working!  The FGs were very keen to get started but we found that three of us trying to make stuff together got a bit fraught, and some of us got a bit tearful (no names, but we are only 9) and others of us lost our temper completely when the machine didn't do what she thought it should be doing (coughs discreetly - yep, that was me!).  However, I have just finished making some little felt stars which will either hang on the Christmas tree or from the mantlepiece on a ribbon.  I'll post a picture tomorrow...Christmas trees are a source of debate amongst our friends and neighbours.  One neighbour has told me that she thinks her husband is mean for wanting to use an old fake Christmas tree that they have had for quite a few years, whilst she preferred to buy a real tree for £30.  I have to say that I felt for her husband, as she has said lately that she wants to cut back on their expenses....We use a fake tree, for several reasons. First and foremost, frugality.  We have had our tree for about 15 years (gosh, that long!) since we had our first house together as a couple.  It came from Argos, and is about 5 feet tall, so we always stand it on a small table, and decorate it to look festive.  It is still in good shape after all these years and will last a good few more, I hope.  I recollect that it cost us about £20, so it has cost us £1.33 a year so far, and the longer we keep it, the less it will have cost  on an annual basis.  We have added to our collection of decorations over the years, and had a couple of sets of lights (I think that I had to buy our third set last year) but we don't go mad with decorations. The other main reason for a fake tree is that I don't agree with buying a tree, keeping it indoors for a couple of weeks and then either it ends up at the dump to get shredded, or one tries to plant it in the garden...sometimes it takes and sometimes it doesn't.  People usually try to justify it by saying that they will dig it up again for next year - but the tree's roots won't stand that kind of disturbance and it usually doesn't look so good the next year and they decide to go and get another one anyway.  Trees deserve a better, more respectful ending than that - we love wood and love things made from wood, and have a great deal of respect for it.  They should not be used and discarded in that way, and I actually believe that it does the environment more good to use a fake tree and let foresters grow trees for better purposes.  I'm not going to be pursuaded from that argument, and will always have a fake tree....So, Woolworths is starting a Closing Down sale tomorrow, there is doom and gloom in the financial markets, redundancies galore, savings rates are plummeting, credit is hard to get, and there is talk of all this turmoil taking years to subside.  I'm going to be controversial here and say that I am coming to believe that this is not such a bad thing in general.  I am truly sorry for those who have lost their jobs and are facing a tough time, but I think that the world needs to look to itself for some of the reasons behind all of this - and I am a novice at commenting on such stuff so I am just saying what I am seeing.  Credit has allowed people to live far beyond their means for more than a generation, and people are not used to going without, saving and working at housekeeping to make ends meet.  The time of \"have now, pay later\" has gone, and it is only those who have the cash now who will be able to buy things easily.  It's a big reality check, and not before time.  I am very conservative and not at all a risk-taker: I have never had a great deal of debt at all as I have always been too scared of what I might lose if I wasn't able to repay it.  I have always waited to buy things until I had the money available, which is a bit of a \"goody two shoes\" attitude perhaps, but it is the way I have learned to live, and it has stood me in good stead now.    I know that The Mom who has been to my house knows that we don't \"decorate\" our house, and that we make do a lot, and we prefer serviceable items to ornamental things, so we \"look\" poor, but hey, I don't care!  What I have is paid for, and that lets me sleep at night.Christmas is a time of celebration - a time of coming together and sharing the joy of Jesus' birth with our friends and relatives.  Christmas is about fellowship, emotion and sharing, not about consumerism, acquisition and increasing debt.  I am looking forward to a day of worship, time with the family together, just the four of us, celebrating and having a good time - watching some TV maybe, playing games, and sharing our Christmas meal.  I would wish for that kind of Christmas for everyone, but perhaps that is not for you - so whatever you are planning, I hope you have a great time."},
{"title": "Washing on a Monday", "date": "Tuesday 9 December 2008", "text": "Once upon a time, the housewife of old would do all her chores on a regular day of the week, and Monday was washday. However, at the moment, I am washing as and when I think I can get the items dry. I have two airers in the house, and as soon as the load on one of them is dry enough to iron, another load goes into the machine to get washed. So, yesterday, I made bread. I am not sure which day was traditionally baking day way back then, but I was in the mood yesterday, so I made two batches of dough in the Kenwood mixer. Each batch was enough for three loaves, and they rose slowly over the course of lunchtime and went in to the oven at about 2pm. By the time the YFG came out of school, there was fresh bread to be spread with butter and enjoyed whilst having a drink and a chat. The loaves have been sliced and stored in the freezer, so I am hoping that there will be enough there for a week, or maybe longer! I know I will do it all again sometime soon...Sunday was actually a lovely day as we went to the Carol Service at the chapel. It was a traditional service of Nine Lessons and Carols. There was a visiting choir from another branch of the church in a nearby town, which sang some of the carols, and we sang the rest. It was great, and I was asked to do one of the readings, which brought back memories from my childhood: whenever it was my mother's turn to do a reading at church, she would get me or my sister to do it, so that eventually we were put on the rota instead of her. The last time I had done a reading in church was at my mother's funeral service in 1998, so it was quite moving to do it again after all this time.There was also a Christmas fair at the Village Hall on Sunday afternoon, which was very well attended by people from all parts of the village. We had a book stall there, and there were probably about 18 stalls, as well as entertainment, Santa's Grotto, refreshments and a raffle, so the organisers should have raised a good amount for the Summer Gala.Yesterday the FH killed four of the cockerels, three of which went in to the freezer and the other went straight into the slow cooker to be roasted slowly overnight. I stripped the meat off the bones this morning and the meat will be eaten cold tonight with buttery mash and pickles. We have nearly finished the first batch of table birds, but the second lot are not yet ready to come outside yet and it will be another couple of months before they are big enough to eat.Bright and sunny but very cold is the weather today, and it is forecast to remain like this for a couple of days, I think, although there might be some of the white stuff in a day or two - the FGs would be very excited if it settled enough to make a snowman...."},
{"title": "Sorry!", "date": "Sunday 7 December 2008", "text": "Haven't been here for nearly a week - apologies as I know how frustrating it can be to read someone's blog when they aren't posting and one gets so fed up of checking back and not finding anything different to read! This week has been a hard one to get through as I have been struggling with the FH still being ill and the YFG being off school since Tuesday with the same chesty cough that has given her little rest.  Running around behind the two of them has been relentless, with requests for drinks, hot-water bottles, snacks, etc - but we do it because we love them and we know that they would do the same for us.  I did get a break from nursing duties when I went to gymnastics on Tuesday and Friday evenings, and there was a school meeting on Wednesday evening that got me out of the house!  I also went to Peterborough on Thursday for a meeting with someone who I think that I will start working with next year - and he has offices in the same building as Merry who runs www.beadmerrily.co.uk who I know from home-education circles, so I had to stop in and have a chat with her for a few minutes.  That was a nice \"catch-up\" moment, and I hope that I might see more of her if I do work with the chap I went to meet.The house looks like a laundry this week as there is washing hanging everywhere, as the weather is so cold that nothing is drying outside.  The FGs school clothes have been hanging from the curtain poles above the radiator but thank goodness they got dry and are now ironed and ready to wear tomorrow."},
{"title": "Another day as head nurse", "date": "Tuesday 2 December 2008", "text": "I have had a busy time today with two patients to look after.  The FH had another day in bed with his chest infection - the antibiotics are not really kicking in yet so he will have to rest and take his time to recover.  The other patient was the YFG who has developed a cough which is so painful for her and to listen to as well - it sounds like a bark and must be making her throat very sore.  She rested, played on her DS, watched TV, had a bath, and made these cute Christmas figures from marzipan - there is a snowman and a present, and then some words.  She gave them to her little friend next door when he got home from school, so I hope he liked them!  I have been coaching at gym tonight, although it doesn't feel like I was there very much; I helped to set up, then coached in the first class.  After that, I had to go to a venue in town where we are going to hold a Christmas party: I needed to pay for the hire of the room, so I dashed off to do that, took another coach home on the way and then the Head Coach asked me to pick up a bag of chips for him for his dinner on the way back to the gym!  All that took ages and so I was back at the gym with only half an hour left before the end of the second class. Since getting home, I have made a bacon pie and garlic bread for their tea, and put one load of washing on the airer to dry.  I am now filling time until the second load of washing is done so that I can hang that before I go to bed.  I am also going to finish writing my Christmas cards so that they can all be posted second class.  Christmas gifts are a trial to me this year  as I still don't really know what to buy a couple of people - including the FH's grandson...he will probably get a good book from my stock as there are some beautiful ones there that I know that he would love and his mum really appreciates books, which is good to see."},
{"title": "Doctors and dietary disasters!", "date": "Monday 1 December 2008", "text": "The FH was feeling so bad over the weekend that I determined that he should get to the doctor's this morning and get some antibiotics for his chest. When I eventually got through and made an appointment for later in the morning, the FH had a disagreement and said that he was not going to travel to town to go to the doctor's, and that they should talk to him on the phone. Unfortunately, they will not prescribe medication over the phone, and I told him so, with the result that he has left the doctor in town and joined the village practice. In the village, we have a doctor and a nurse practitioner, in a small surgery which is open every day. The FH went, registered with them, gave blood and saw the doctor, and was duly prescribed the required antibiotics, which he is now taking.The dietary disaster is me!  I have been doing very well with my eating lately and lost a good few pounds but then I noticed that the loss had slowed down and was even stopping - and that got me disheartened!  I suppose that is why I have fallen \"off the wagon\" and have been eating too much of the wrong things again - too many sweet things!  However, on thinking about it, it may be that that is not such a bad thing (I am convincing myself, maybe not you, though!?!) as perhaps the loss had slowed because my body felt that I was starving it, and so eating a little more for a week or so may mean that a return to the eating plan next week will kick-start the loss again.....I can hope!"},
{"title": "Advent Sunday", "date": "Sunday 30 November 2008", "text": "Advent Sunday is the first Sunday in Advent, and this year it fell today, on the 30th November. It was lovely to arrive at church this morning and find the Advent candle wreath ready to be lit, and some discreet Christmas decorations around the church - nothing too much, but some bright flower arrangements which included candles as their centrepieces, and some ornamental bits on the windowsills. It felt festive but not over the top. We talked about what Advent means and how the coming of the Christ-child is a long awaited event, and how hard that waiting can be, whatever it is you are waiting for! Unfortunately we had to reflect on the trend for the waiting to be focussed on the greed of the \"I want\" type of person, interested only in what Christmas will bring, perhaps as gifts, food and drinks, or entertainment. Sadly, few think of Jesus when they are thinking of Advent and Christmas. For far too many, Advent is the word that prefixes \"calendar\" and means a daily dose of chocolate, and nothing else. How sad.In these tough financial times, it would be good to move away from the material acquisitions of gifts and entertainment experiences, towards fellowship with friends and family, church members and neighbours, and to think more of giving that of receiving. It costs nothing to speak to a lonely older person and cheerily wish them, \"Merry Christmas!\" when you may have been the only person to have spoken with them on that day. It would cost only a little more to invite such a person to share the celebrations with us and our families. I am afraid that I take the easy option which is a little bit of a cop-out on that front, and I make an annual donation to the Salvation Army here which does an amazing amount of social care for homeless people, older people and those who have little - they have centres which will be open on Christmas Day serving lunches to people who would otherwise be alone, they provide a huge number of meals every day to homeless people on the streets, and they provide boxes of food and small presents to families who are struggling to put food on the table at this time of year. Those are just a few of the wonderful things that the Salvation Army does each year, and I support their work in this arena.The message of the service this morning was that God has a plan. He planned for Jesus' birth from the beginning of the world, and events in the Old Testament bear witness to the prophecies which were proved in his lifetime on earth. That Jesse was the father of David, and that David's line would eventually bear fruit in Jesus was all part of the plan, and how wonderful to believe that there is as big a plan for each one of our lives! How humbling to think that God has planned us and our lives to that extent - but how great must our faith be to allow God's hand to work in our lives and let us follow the path that He has chosen for us.I KNOW that that is true, because God saved the FH's life through the FH's relationship with me. Although the end of a relationship is a sad and terrible time, if the FH had not decided to move out of his home with his previous wife and go and live with his mother, and then ultimately to pursue a relationship with me, he would have probably died sometime in 2000. Because he was living in Scotland, which was my choice of home, he was given a second chance in 1999 when he had a heart transplant at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary. The transplant hospital near to where he lived with his first wife would not have given him that chance at life, because he did not fit their criteria. The surgeon at Glasgow then was a little more radical and experimental, and willing to give it a go. I really do Thank God that they had that attitude there, as he is doing well 8 years later. The surgeon had to remove the old heart with a great deal of suction as it had deteriorated so badly that it was like jelly, and he was sure that it would not have lasted much longer at all.That plan that God has is not revealed to us in advance, so we have to have faith in Him and trust that by living in His way, His plan will bring us safely through this life and on to the next. In following His way, we will do good in this earthly life, I am sure. The big thing is to remember constantly that this is HIS plan, and not ours. There is little point in sitting down on New Year's Eve and planning 2009 out for ourselves. The trouble with our plans is that they are usually selfish - we think too much of ourselves. When I think about the things I hoped to achieve in 2008, I was planning greater earnings, holidays and an easier life. I got none of that, but I have gained other, more meaningful things, and I can look back on a year in which I found a new church, which my children are happy and eager to attend on a regular basis, I made new friends, and I actually cut back on the amount I earned because I did less work! I spent more time with my family, and I have had a good year. God's plan was obviously a better one than mine! Can't wait to see what is in store for 2009....."},
{"title": "Boots!", "date": "Saturday 29 November 2008", "text": "We didn't get them in town on Thursday and the YFG was SO disappointed. We went to the shop and tried on the two pairs that the manager had ordered in for the YFG to try, but neither pair was any good at all. She came home in the depths of despair, it seemed. Yesterday, I started phoning places - a friend told me about a shoe shop in Peterborough which specialises in wide and narrow fitting shoes, but when I called them for directions, the chap said that they were closing down. I then started on Google - and found a couple of local-ish shops stocking a wider variety of brands, and had a lovely chat with Tracy at Smiths Footwear in Downham Market. She was very helpful and we have been to the shop this afternoon and we HAVE BOOTS! The staff were patient and kind with the YFG, very informative and helpful, and I cannot recommend them more highly. The huge beam of a smile on the YFG's face was well worth the trip over there, and we got some other shopping whilst we were there. DM is a lovely town, with independent retailers as well as a few chain stores, but it has a great atmosphere - I do wish we lived there sometimes, but the occasional trek over there keeps me happy."},
{"title": "Addition to the flock", "date": "Friday 28 November 2008", "text": "Yes, we have another chicken! This is a bantam which is from the same clutch of eggs as the Dutch bantam which we have already got, and I have posted pictures of in the past. This \"new\" Dutch bantam is one of a group of three that we gave to a friend, and the other two have passed on for one reason or another, so this one was lonely on her own and has come home to roost with us. At the moment, she is in a pen on her own, but she will be integrated eventually with the others. She has different colouring from the other one, in that her feathering shows more brownish tones. I will take photos when it gets brighter outside, but it is dull, grey and misty here this morning.The FGs are off to school and the FH is resting in a hot bath at the moment. He has not had a good night's sleep with his cold, and has been quite restless. He finally gave up and got up to make some tea at 6.45 am, and brought me a cup, which was a change as usually it is me who is getting up first and bringing him tea. I think that he may sleep again this morning as he has to go out this afternoon. The YFG is going round to a friend's house after school and then I will meet up with her at gymnastics tonight as the little girl also comes to gym tonight, so that is working out very well. The EFG will have to be picked up from school instead of coming home on the bus as by the time she got here on the bus, there would be no one here. I will get her and drop her off with the FH where he will be selling books this afternoon as that is on my way to gym. I hate November as much as I love it as it throws up all sorts of complicated arrangements and makes life so challenging! But it is the month when we do so much business that we can't afford to stick our heads in the sand and ignore it! Nearly over, though!In my brief intro in the sidebar, I said that I am overweight - well, I am not as overweight as I was! I am now down to 148lbs, and so pleased!!! I need to lose a little more as I am only 5ft 4in tall, but it is a huge step in the right direction. I will post an update when I have achieved more."},
{"title": "Scrapbook page I made today", "date": "Thursday 27 November 2008", "text": "The blue rectangle on the right is where I will position a photograph of a snowy day, when I have taken one!  The page has taken a combination of stamping with a roller, heat and stick technique for the glittery snowflakes, ribbling for textured papers, and a lot of copying someone who had the fab idea in the first place!  I am pleased, and must now find an opportunity to take a suitable photo to put in.The party last night went well - there were just enough chairs as not all the guests were able to come.  Enough came and bought chocolate to get me about £27 worth of free chocs though - although none are actually for me to eat: some are for the FH and girls and a few are for gifts.  All the guests seemed to enjoy it, and the Phoenix card lady also sold quite a lot of cards, so she was pleased too.Both of the FGs are at school today although the EFG had rather a rush to get ready as I went back to sleep after the alarm and then didn't wake up until 7.40 and she has to get the bus at 8, so we rushed and ran and she made it!  The YFG wasn't keen to go but she has gone, with the promise of going into town afterwards to get her new boots for the winter.  Her feet are so wide that there weren't any in the shop in her size last week and so the manager agreed to order some in for her to try.  They are in and so she is itching to get in there and buy some! I have been to the scrapbooking and card making workshop this morning.  It has been fun, and now I am waiting for a customer to come to look at some books, then I have to pack the car ready to go to a booksale this evening.  The FH is suffering from his cold and so he is wrapped up and watching the TV.  Tonight's supper will be a recipe called \"Sticky Chicken\" which the girls love - chicken drumsticks coated in a sticky sauce, served with rice and veggies.  That will go in the Remoska and cook in about 45 minutes, between coming back from town with the boots and nipping off to the booksale!Hope you are all having a good day."},
{"title": "Calm before the storm", "date": "Wednesday 26 November 2008", "text": "I am feeling surprisingly calm right now, which is weird given the amount of rushing around and tidying that I am about to embark upon.  The EFG has gone to school, worried lest she has missed a lot of work and about how to catchup with it all.  Thank goodness that she has agreed to wear the winter coat that I got her from Asda - a fab black three-quarter length black coat, with some wool in it, for just £15, so I got myself one as well.  The YFG is still tucked up in bed this morning and I am hoping that she stays there for at least another hour as she has been coughing a lot in the night and can't have had much sleep.  She is going to help me to do a bit of tidying later when she gets up, she says! The roast chicken lunch was lovely yesterday, and the girls had chicken rolls for their tea as well.  There is still a large leg left, which will probably be the FH's lunch today, although I may pinch a bit for the YFG to have another roll before it all goes.  The FH has indeed come down with the cold, but he is going out this morning to deliver some books for me, and taking his friend with him for the ride.  They are going out near Ely so will no doubt be seeing the floodwaters on the Welney washes and commenting on the amount of water so early in the winter.I have got a small mountain of washing to get done, but I am not planning to try to tackle it today as I don't want wet washing around tonight and the weather is not looking conducive to getting it dry outside today, although if it brightens up later, I may do a load to hang under the verandah.I am planning an electricity challenge!  I want to take meter readings every day for a week, find our average daily usage that week and then aim to cut it down then next week.  I can't do that with the water meter as I can't get at the meter to read it as it is down a hole in the pavement outside the house; I don't have the tool to lift the lid with, either.  We already do OK with water, so I am going to concentrate on electricity for now - we are paying £58 a month to our supplier at the moment, and I am sure that they are itching to put it up further!  I will be starting this at the weekend."},

The FH thinks he is getting it too, so I have a mini-epidemic going on here! I am coping with the nursing - lots of hot drinks of hot lemon juice with honey, cough medicines and lots of tissues. They are amusing themselves with books, tv and games, so they are doing OK. They had a lie-in this morning and both of them had a decent night's sleep. My dad called earlier this morning to suggest visiting as he is going on an 18-night cruise on Sunday, so he wanted to see us before he went. I told him about the girls and advised against visiting as the last thing he wants is to get ill on holiday! He may have time to come at the end of the week, so we will keep him up-to-date with the recovery.I am having a chocolate party here tomorrow night, and have to do some major re-arranging of furniture as well as tidying up. There are about 18-20 people coming, so I am wondering where they will all sit...may have to borrow some chairs and have already asked my sister to bring extra coffee mugs.Just now I am roasting a chicken for lunch, with roasted potatoes, broccoli and carrots. The FH is going out to a book sale for me tonight so I wanted to give him a hot meal at lunchtime as it would otherwise be difficult for him to have one because of the times of the sale tonight. He is not going to his art club this afternoon as it would just be too much rushing around for him in one day. I guess that being his age is a bit like how I felt when I was pregnant - I could do one \"big\" thing each day, but no more! Sometimes we just have to pace ourselves a bit more carefully and not expect miracles."},

She was awake a lot in the night last night as well, and is not up to going to school tomorrow.  I have had her snuggled up under a duvet on the sofa for much of the day, watching TV, reading and playing on her DS.  The YFG is not as ill at the moment, but she is not 100% either as she has the cough and has been complaining of a headache today.  Not sure what tomorrow will hold for her - she wants to go to school because she has a school dinner booked, and she likes to have that once a week treat, but we will have to assess her health in the morning.I have had an interesting day, pootling around and getting a few things done.  I made beef casserole and dumplings for tea but because they are all feeling a little ill, none of them had a huge appetite and there is enough of the steak and gravy left to go into a steak pie tomorrow.  I also made apple batter last night when I had the oven on for the pizza and that is being eaten slowly - it smells gorgeous when I heat it up a portion at a time in the microwave - a real hit of cinnamon which makes the kitchen smell wonderful."},
{"title": "A quiet day at home alone", "date": "Saturday 22 November 2008", "text": "That was yesterday to a tee.  The FH went out early, the FGs went to school and I had the whole day until 3pm to do whatever needed doing.  I did the early morning chores - got the helpful machines working (the dishwasher and the washing machine) and then started baking.  Three kinds of cake (malt loaf, ginger cake and chocolate brownies) and three kinds of biscuits (oat biscuits, choc chip and cherry, and custard biscuits) followed and the house smelled wonderful!  Some of the produce has been eaten already, some is in the tins in the kitchen for the week and the rest is in the freezer for later.  I tried to make enough for two weeks as I am so busy next week that there won't be a chance to bake, I am afraid. I do like making the things that I know that the family love, but I also like to try out new things.  The YFG has an annoying habit of not liking something today that she loved last week - it is so frustrating!  Thank goodness that the EFG and FH don't have that tendency.  I have subscribed to two recipe websites which are sending out a cookie recipe a day between now and Christmas so that I have lots of new ones to try.  Last year, the teachers at school all got cookies from the FGs so they may get new and exciting ones this year!  Depends on how adventurous I feel...Our turkey is really beginning to look like a turkey - he has a long red neck and is beginning (poor thing!) to look quite ugly.  I still don't think that he will be Christmas Dinner, and we have a joint of beef lined up for that anyway, so he'll be reprieved into the New Year - possibly until Easter.  Obviously turkeys are more slow growing than the chickens we have got, which are quite aggressive in their rate of growth.  I'm just not sure how the turkey will be feeling when all his mates have been dispatched - he may get lonely.The delightful little boy of four who has recently moved in next door is teaching the YFG a few words of Portuguese - and she is thrilled.  She walks to school with him and his mum on fine days, and we all go in our car together on wet ones.  A good example of neighbourly co-operation, I thought.  He likes to come and play with her on Saturday afternoons - they sit together on the sofa and play on their DSs, or bounce on the trampoline and she is just like a mother hen with a precious chick. The weather is cold today but there is no snow here, although some is forecast for tomorrow morning.  It has been a bright, sunny day which has been glorious in the sunshine although very cold - about 3degrees C when we went out to gymnastics this morning at 9.30am.  It had risen to 7 by the time we came out at lunchtime.  Still makes me want to snuggle in with a blanket and not do anything.  Shame, as I have more uniforms to wash and hang to dry, and tea to cook before I can sit down this evening.  I think that pizza may be on the menu tonight as it is quite popular for a Saturday night here, although a hot pudding might go down well too!  Tomorrow is a real winter warmer - beef casserole with dumplings."},
{"title": "Winter winds are coming", "date": "Thursday 20 November 2008", "text": "and the children are so excited at the thought that there might be snow tomorrow.  The TV weather forecasters have been telling us all week of an \"arctic blast\" of air coming down from the north this weekend, and of snow showers.  The YFG is hopeful, so hopeful, that there will be enough snow for a snowman that she has written a story tonight about a huge award-winning snowman that she and her friend plan to build!  I think that the snow might look more like a sprinkling of icing sugar than the drifts that she is imagining....I personally dread snow because of the misery it can cause on the roads - I am just plain scared of driving in snow, and actively avoid it if I can.  I got caught in it one night driving from St Andrews back to Cupar in Scotland and it was horribly frightening.  I was only about 22 or so, and relatively inexperienced at driving in snow - and I was alone in the car with no one to advise me.  I crawled home and vowed never to go out in it again.  I am happy to walk in it, throw the odd snowball, and watch it fall but that is about the limit of my enthusiasm for the white stuff.I plan to bake tomorrow so I am going to go to bed now and take along a couple of recipe books for inspiration for baking!"},
{"title": "Garden and chickens update", "date": "Wednesday 19 November 2008", "text": "The garden has been neglected, I am afraid.  This always happens in the autumn as it is my busiest time of year with the work that I do: people always want to buy more books in the run-up to Christmas so I have a lot less time available to me for other things.  I manage to keep up the laundry and the cooking, but the housework gets a little neglected some weeks, and the garden is way down the list of priorities for me.  The colder weather means that the FH is more reluctant to be out there as well - and to be honest, he is such a help to me in my work that he is often assisting me and has little spare time either.  (He is snoozing right now, though - a pre-lunch nap to get the energy for lunch, perhaps!) The garden situation at the moment is that there are heaps of horse manure on some of the beds, waiting for drier weather so that they can be dug into the beds.  One bed still has some leeks growing at one end of it, another has the freshly-planted strawberry plants, which are settling in quite well now, and there are broad bean seeds just germinating in one other bed.  That must mean that the green stuff growing in most of the others is weed!  Argh! The chickens are OK.  The younger meat birds are growing well, and the older ones are being eaten at the rate of one a week with the occasional one being put in the freezer so there are about 7 or 8 left.  Must go and count them!  The laying birds are not - laying, that is.  This causes me a moral and financial dilemma.  I am feeding 16 \"laying\" birds, which obviously costs me quite a bit, and I would normally be repaid in eggs, which I can use myself and sell a few surplus ones to my neighbours.  At the moment, though, there are no eggs being laid and so if I want eggs, I have to buy them.    If I had not got hens of my own, I would just buy free-range eggs and that would be that.  However, my budget is not stretching enough to allow me to buy free-range eggs at the supermarket AND still feed these hens of mine.  I don't feel happy about it, but that is the situation.  I am having to buy cheaper eggs apart from when I can source cheap, free-range eggs, which is not often.Got to go and do the ironing now - and then maybe some baking....."},
{"title": "Tesco rage!", "date": "Tuesday 18 November 2008", "text": "Last night was a bad night for me!  It started off OK - I went out to a lovely lady's house and sold books to all her invited guests.  We all had a good evening, chatting and looking at beautiful books.  It got to 9.45 pm and the party was over.  I had decided that if the party was finished before 10, I would go and do my shopping.  After all, that new Tesco in the town is a 24 hour one, and I thought that at 10pm, the aisles would be less crowded, and I would get my shopping done OK.I was right about the aisles being clear - I floated around the store and filled my trolley with a good load of shopping.  I hadn't been shopping for a couple of weeks apart from for fridge food and fruits/veggies, so there was some stocking up to be done.  The shop floor staff were helpful, guiding me towards things that I couldn't find, and didn't seem to mind the odd interruption to their shelf-stacking (well, I wouldn't object either - it looked a bit boring!!). The staff outnumbered the customers by a considerable margin.It was all going swimmingly and I got some great bargains in the \"reduced to clear\" section, including some packs of salmon, cod and haddock which had been reduced from more than £3 each to about 60-odd pence each - fab!  Then I hit the checkouts - and it felt like a brick wall.  All the checkouts were closed and I had to scan the whole lot through a self-service till.  It took ages, and because I made a joking comment to a member of staff about a reduced level of service at that time of night, she fetched a line manager to speak to me patronisingly about the security risks of having access to cash in tills - he reckoned that there might be a hold-up (his words!!) so it was better that the staff had no access to cash.  I politely said that now he had told me that the tills close at 10pm, I'll be sure not to shop there again at that time of night.  I have since written a letter to the manager explaining my disappointment at the service offered, and suggested that if a hold-up is a serious risk, they should consider employing more security staff. This has opened up the whole Tesco debate for me again.  I had been planning to have a delivery again, but then thought that I would go on this occasion because I was in town anyway, and would get the chance to look at the reduced items.  It would also be less crowded at that time of night.  I did stick to my guns about the range of things that the Tesco is now selling and only bought food and cleaning items - I was not tempted by the homewares, books, electrical items, stationery, clothing and shoes!  I didn't buy any special Christmas stuff beyond two jars of mincemeat, and I kept to the list - very strictly.  So I was successful in a way."},
{"title": "Happy day", "date": "Sunday 16 November 2008", "text": "I have enjoyed today, in a variety of ways.  It started with a long lie-in this morning - I didn't wake up till past nine and the YFG sneaked in to the bed for a cuddle before we got up.  We had some breakfast together and then I helped the FH to pack some books in to the car so that he could take the FGs off to do a booksale for me this afternoon.  It was about an hour away, and they would be travelling over lunchtime, so I packed them some sandwiches and snacks to munch on during the afternoon.  They left here at about 11.30 and I started pottering around the house. I picked things up and put them away; I sorted laundry and did numerous loads of washing - some got dry, some didn't - I am hoping for a good drying day tomorrow!  I made bread a different way: I made enough dough for three loaves and mixed in a very old Kenwood Chef that my aunt gave me years ago.  It saves some of the work of the kneading but I then turn the dough out onto the worksurface and knead it myself as well.  Then I separate the dough into three balls and put them to rise in the loaf tins - for ages!  They rose over a period of about 3 hours, and I didn't knock them back any further but just cooked them, and they are lovely loaves of white bread.  Last week I bought an electric slicing machine (Kenwood).  It makes very short work of slicing the loaves, so that I can now produce home-made sliced white bread which I am storing in the freezer until we need it.I also did some baking, but I wanted to make something different from those recipes which I have been using lately.  So, I made a fruitcake for the FH which I don't make that often because he has to eat it all himself as the FGs don't like dried fruits in general.  I also made some custard cookies, the recipe for which came from www.moneysavingexpert.com on the forums.  It is a recipe which uses icing sugar instead of caster sugar and then adds custard powder to the flour.  The cookies came out very golden in colour which I suppose is down to the yellowness of the custard powder, but the testers said that they taste good.  I would double the recipe next time I make it though, so that I could freeze some.  Lastly, I made a chocolate tray bake which was in honour of the FH's birthday tomorrow.  I will be working tomorrow evening so we had a singsong tonight and wished him a very Happy Birthday for tomorrow.The FGs and FH returned home at about 5.45pm and had had a good afternoon of sales.  Sometimes these little sales can not be as profitable as one would wish, but this one had been good and they came home happy!  I was pleased for them, and for me, as when the FH has a bad sale, he can be rather grumpy!!Today has been relaxed and enjoyable for me because I have been doing things that I enjoy, and I have had some peaceful time to myself.  It was refreshing, and I feel better able to get on with the week ahead!  It should be available on prescription!!"},
{"title": "Apologies for absence - again!", "date": "Saturday 15 November 2008", "text": "It has seemed a very long week!  I haven't recovered from last weekend yet, and already I am looking towards next week's workload.  I have had some school meetings, some book sales and parties in people's homes, gymnastics three times, some visitors and lots of housework to catch up on.  The ironing has been overwhelming but I got there in the end!!There is a lot of media attention on the financial problems of the world right now.  We are carrying on here pretty much as normal.  We don't carry any debt so there are no huge worries about repayments but the savings that I have managed to squirrel away are suffering from the interest rates dropping - it may be good for people with mortgages but I am getting less return on my few pounds in the bank!  We are being a little more careful in general, but I am continuing with my pantry keeping, and it has been beneficial to us because of where we live, as I have explained before.  The chickens are being eaten (we have one ready for tomorrow!) and we are continuing to enjoy the meat that they provide as an exceptional treat.  Unfortunately, the hens who are supposed to be laying are not, and I am having to buy eggs now.  This is a source of frustration to me. Christmas is coming, we are told all around us - the shops are full of cards, wrapping paper, gifts and posters advertising specials.  I am only buying those things that I know I need - no \"just in case\" bits and pieces this year.  I am getting a few extra-special holiday groceries in each week, so that I don't have to have a hugely expensive shopping bill in the week before Christmas.  We don't need to eat fancy foods for more than a week - it is enough that we enjoy the day itself, remember the reason that we are celebrating, and seek out the company of those who are special to us.  I am going to start to think about the menus for Christmas day and Boxing Day in the next week or so as those are the days on which we are likely to have guests and on which I may want to serve special foods, but we are fairly traditional in our tastes and I know that there will be a good selection of home baking on the menu, along with some simple but traditional dishes. One thing that I will be looking for especially is a new 1000 piece jigsaw.  We have our own tradition since we moved to this house of having a Big Christmas puzzle to do that we leave out over the holiday and we all enjoy sitting around and placing the odd piece here and there.  I will be having a good look in all the charity shops over the coming weeks to see if I can find one."},
{"title": "Shopping at home", "date": "Tuesday 11 November 2008", "text": "I went shopping in my freezer last night - came out with a good few bargains!  Frozen plums for dessert tonight, bread for breakfast, rolls for lunch, cookies for the biscuit tin and a cake for lunchboxes.  Accrued benefits of earlier baking and freezing sessions which were well worth the extra effort for the ease afforded now!Early start today as I have to go and see my favourite school's headmaster -the children raised over £600 in a sponsored read and the local pub donated another £600 odd to the school for books so the head and staff have to choose £2000 worth from my catalogues.  They are feeling a little overwhelmed by the task so I am nipping in there this morning to lend a hand!"},
{"title": "Favourite plants", "date": "Monday 10 November 2008", "text": "Just a couple of photos of two of my collection of Christmas cacti.  They are flowering now, and they are beautiful!   I always manage to acquire one or two new ones each year to add to the collection and I am eagerly awaiting their arrival in the shops in the next week or two!!We have survived!  It was jolly hard work over the four days - it took Thursday to load up and travel there and then set up the stand - then we were trading 9-5 over Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  I was pleased with the stand by the time we had finished it, and it offered a huge range of books for the customers to browse through and from which to make purchases. The show wasn't as large as it has been in the past, and some customers were a little disappointed with the lack of stands - there were a lot missing from previous years.  The Showground also double booked Usborne so there were two of us there.  The other poor chap came off worse as he is a \"beginner\" with Usborne and doesn't carry the amount of stock I do, not has he the experience of doing big shows.  The Showground said that they now had a policy that such a show could support more than one of us.  Sorry, but we didn't agree. He and I were selling the exact same range of books, and it looks unprofessional to have two of us there - and no end of people commented on there being two of us.  The other stallholder was a nice chap, and we talked about things together.   This was a cosy corner for slightly older kids to browse through the fiction titles and make their own selections (photo above). And so the FGs were at their aunt's house for the weekend: they helped to bake Christmas cakes on Saturday afternoon and had a trip to the cinema on Sunday to see \"Mamma Mia!\" which they enjoyed.  We missed them and were very glad to have them home again last night.  Big hugs all round! The FH is exhausted after the weekend, and has been asleep in the chair in the lounge all morning so I had better take him some lunch.  Today it is raining and is forecast to go on and on.  Baking is on the agenda, I think, as the freezer and tins are empty.  I did get a new gadget delivered yesterday - an electric slicing machine, so I will be able to slice my home made bread to an acceptable thinness for lunchbox sandwiches now, saving a little more money."},
{"title": "Time has flown - again!", "date": "Thursday 6 November 2008", "text": "And I haven't been here since Monday!  And the week is nearing its close already.....where have we been?! Monday was school, band practice, shopping, and chicken curry for tea.  Tuesday was gymnastics after school, then tea, bath and bed, and yesterday was a big one - so much went on.  I went to school for a 9.15am meeting, stood around till 9.30 to find that the meeting has been postponed and I hadn't been told.  Then I dashed off to town to get change, pay a bill and do a little bit of shopping.  The YFG was excited about school as she was having the Bonfire Day special school lunch, and was so looking forward to that.  She enjoyed it and told everyone all about it several times.  When I picked her up from school, we came home to find that the FH had forgotten to take the EFG's kit bag with him to pick her up for her exercise class, so we had to go haring off to catch him up.  When we got back, the YFG's friend came round to play and stay for tea.  I made them pasta in cheese, garlic and ham sauce, followed by chocolate cake (menu of their choice) and then cooked for the FH and I later.  The friend's parents came to pick her up at about 7.15pm and told us that they might be moving.  That saddened me as I am beginning to think of the mum as a friend, and the YFG gets on so well with the little girl that it will be a shame to see them move away, although they don't seem to be planning to go too far. This morning, I have been packing books into the trailer again for the big East of England Christmas Festival at Peterborough.  This is a three day show so we are going there this afternoon to set up the stall and then we have to trade 9-5 over the Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  This is a huge show and we have had a stall there every year since it began about 5 years ago.  The FGs will be staying with my sister for the weekend, so they will be having a little break from home too. Must remember to take the camera so that I can take photos again - the stall will be different this time as we have neighbours in a shell scheme so we can't have the end open....not entirely sure what I am planning, but hoping it works OK!!"},
{"title": "More baking.......", "date": "Monday 3 November 2008", "text": "The YFG loves the slabs of walnut cake that you can buy in supermarkets - it was on offer the other week in Sainsbury's at 2 for £2, but they are not very substantial slabs.  My gannets eat the slab and look for more in a few minutes!  However, looking for a recipe for a walnut cake like this is like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack.  Coffee and walnut, date and walnut, etc - it seems that there are 101 recipes for combinations involving walnuts but nothing out there for a cake using only the solitary walnut.  I looked and looked - then I gave up and concocted my own.  I now make very finely chopped walnuts in the food processor, make a loaf tin sponge batter and then fold in the walnuts at the last minute - and it works!  This is the second time that I have made it, and the FGs and FH love it.  It is also, as you can see, a very substantial cake and it takes some eating - well, it lasts a couple of days instead of 10 minutes, so that is an improvement. And then there was the bread in the Remoska.  I thought I would use the same recipe but make rolls instead of mini-loaves this time, and it is a huge success.  The 8 rolls nestled nicely in the Remoska pan, and cooked in about half an hour.  They tore apart well, and the tops are crusty.  Four are waiting to go into the lunches tomorrow and four are in the freezer.  And this is SLOW bread - I started the dough at about 10am, left it to rise until nearly 2pm, knocked it back and shaped it into the rolls and left it again, and then baked it at about 3.45pm.  It didn't seem to take much hands-on time at all, and it was very forgiving in that it didn't mind being left quite a long time in between kneading and knocking back.  This is bread as it should be!!Doesn't that look great?! Happy baking, everyone!"},
{"title": "Back to school", "date": "Monday 3 November 2008", "text": "Both the FGs went back to school today - with a bit of a sigh of relief from me, I am ashamed to say.  They are hard work when they are home together at the moment as there is constant competition between them, bickering and one-upmanship - and it becomes quite exhausting after a week.  Only when I turn on them both do they come together in a united front against me!  This is the part of them going to school that saddens me, as I do see this change in their attitudes to one another as a result of them being at school, and away from the home for a large part of the day.  I need to find some way of helping them to re-connect with one another in an appropriate way; I can handle a bit of friendly rivalry but this is becoming a chore to deal with.  Any advice out there??Today I have done only one load of washing as I have no more line space under the verandah and the weather is not good enough to actually peg it on the outside line.  I have one loaf in the bread machine and some dough for rolls proving at the moment - I am going to bake the rolls in the remoska.  The bread was good, it seems, so hopefully the rolls will be too. Another cockerel has been eaten this weekend.  I cooked him slowly over about 5 and a half hours in the slow-cooker on Saturday evening, and then took most of the meat off the bones, and refrigerated it.  The remaining bones were left in the slow-cooker, and I added a couple of onions, a parsnip and some carrots as well as a kettleful of water.  This was then left to cook all night and the following morning and we had chicken soup for lunch on Sunday.  For the evening meal, I took some chicken breast meat, added a can of condensed mushroom soup, covered it all with a suet crust and made a pie.  This was very well received and appreciated! There is still more chicken to be had, so I think it may become a curry tonight. I am trying not to use the oven much and so that is one reason to cook the chicken in the slow-cooker, and when I cooked the pie yesterday, I also made jam roly-poly with the leftover suet dough, and a walnut cake, so I made the most of the opportunity.  Using the Remoska, the bread machine and the slow-cooker, which all use relatively little electricity, should mean lower electricity bills - we can hope!"},
{"title": "Pampering day for the girls!", "date": "Saturday 1 November 2008", "text": "At lunchtime today, the girls and I loaded up the car with a couple of boxes of craft and cookery books, and went to a local village hall for the afternoon.  The Guiding group are trying to recruit some local leaders and they organised a craft, pamper and healthy eating afternoon for the ladies of the area.  It was fun!  My book stall was sandwiched between my sister's Pampered Chef stall and a scrapbooking lady that I know, so I had someone to chat with on either side, so that although we didn't do a huge amount of business, we still had a good afternoon.  The FGs were trying out all the pampering ideas on offer - the YFG had her nails painted and a mini-facial, then they both made a decorative box with a soap maker and a Christmas card with the scrapbooking lady. Apart from that, we have had a restful sort of day - all the washing and ironing is up to date, and the housework can wait until Monday when the FGs are back at school."},
{"title": "The £5 meal", "date": "Friday 31 October 2008", "text": "Everywhere, it seems, we are being bombarded by the idea that we can \"feed the family for a fiver\" (I think that is Sainsbury's particular slogan but they are not the only ones!) but to be honest, can we all afford to spend a whole fiver on the main meal every day?  That would take the grocery bill to £35 just for the one meal, never mind the puddings, snacks, breakfasts, lunches, and fruit.  It seems to me that £5 is a figure for me not to exceed, and often I would like to come in under that, so that the week's cost is around £50 for all our food from the shops. Tonight, I have served the family with cauliflower and pasta cheese bake -  it served three of them with leftovers, and the total cost was just £1.84.  They then had a slice of cake each for pudding, and a drink.  Some meals do cost more, especially when we are eating meat, but tonight's meal is well under, and last night's pizza would not have cost more than £2 at a guess, so that is another night under the target.  I reckon that as a family, we are aiming to have low cost meals at least three times a week, and more often sometimes!   Pasta is a particularly good ingredient on which to base a low-cost meal, as I buy it for less than a £1/kg, and sauces can be made at very little cost."},
{"title": "Baking day!", "date": "Thursday 30 October 2008", "text": "This is the Remoska cooker that I posted about the other day.  It consists of a lid containing the heating element, a non-stick deep pan, and a stainless steel stand.  I have had a bit of an experiment with it today and successfully baked some bread in it (photo further down) so I am very pleased with it.  Here is the pizza which I made for tea for the family.  Simple and quick and very cost effective (doesn't that sound so much better than \"cheap\"?!) to make.  I have told you about this pizza recipe before, so I thought I would share a picture today. And these are two little loaves of bread that cooked in the Remoska this afternoon.  They have been sampled and deemed acceptable, so I shall be making that again! And the Christmas cakes were made as well - the fruit soaked overnight; it was plump and juicy in the orange juice and brandy mixture this morning.  I closed the oven door on them at about 10.20 this morning, so they were baked through by about 1.30 this afternoon.  The house smelt wonderful whilst they were baking - cinnamon and all the spices came together to provide a really festive fragrance already.  The oil delivery came this afternoon, and the driver had an extra 70 litres on board that were spare, so we took those at the same price.  That was a bargain as the price has already risen on the price I got on Monday.  The FGs and I went to the scrapbooking/stamping studio this afternoon; we had a lovely chat with the lady who runs it, and made some beautiful creations.  It is very relaxing to go there and switch off from other things and just create something under her guidance!"},
{"title": "Oil", "date": "Wednesday 29 October 2008", "text": "Just a quick note to say that I ordered oil on Monday - the price had begun to rise!  I knew that the prices would rise as soon as I heard on the news at 10pm on Friday that the OPEC organisation had cut oil production to stimulate prices!  The trouble was that at 10pm on a Friday, it was too late to order oil before the rises kicked in on Monday, so I was stuck paying 41.61p/l but that was much better than what the company I use wanted to charge - they tried 46.something, but I haggled a little and got it down.  The delivery is due tomorrow.  We haven't had the forecast snow, although it was cold this morning.  Counties not too far away have had some, so we were blessed to miss out this time, especially as it has meant power cuts in Northamptonshire.I have just finished reading the edited wartime diaries of Nella Last, who lived in Barrow-on-Furness in Cumbria.  Her husband was a master carpenter, and she had two sons, Cliff and Arthur.  She was a \"housewife\" until the outbreak of the war, when she joined the Womens' Voluntary Service and helped to run a canteen and a charity shop.  She suffered from \"nerves\" and had had a breakdown the year before the diary begins.  She kept the diary for the Mass Observation project, and apparently kept scribbling for over 30 years.  The entries are fascinating as she talks about the food problems, the rationing, the bomb shelter, keeping chickens in the back garden and growing cabbages amongst the rose bushes.  Arthur was in a reserved occupation as a tax inspector, but Cliff joined the army, initially as a PT instructor.  It is a truly fascinating insight into one woman's experience of the war.  I also bought the DVD of the film that Victoria Wood (fab UK actress and writer) wrote based on the diaries, and I sat and watched that this morning.  It was very moving - as well as Nella's thoughts about the war, we also get a picture of a marriage that is teetering on the brink but one that seems to pull through - divorce was uncommon those days.  I can recommend the book, and will be looking out for a copy of \"Nella Last's Peace\" which contains some of her post-war entries.  I found time to watch that this morning as I had taken the EFG to the sports centre for the day again, and the YFG had gone with the FH to an auction on the Norfolk/Suffolk border to sell some hens and rabbits.  After watching that, and hanging out the washing, I managed to clean out a hen house - it was a lovely sunny day and it was a joy to be outside!  Unfortunately, I got rather a lot of chicken poo on my trousers and straw everywhere, so I had to come in for a shower before lunch! After picking the EFG up again at 3, we went to Lidl's for orange juice and cat food, Woolworths for two birthday presents, and the local book shop for a browse.  By the time we got home, the others had just got back and were having a cup of tea.  The FH had had instructions to buy some green veggies (success - he got a cabbage and a cauliflower) and some eggs (he got some, yes) but he bought 3 trays of eggs - that is 90 eggs!!!!  They are free range eggs, and worked out at £1 a dozen, so I rang a few friends and sold 5 dozen.  That leaves me with one tray - much more manageable.After tea, I weighed out some dried fruit and have set it to soak overnight in the orange juice and some brandy so that I can make two Christmas cakes in the morning.  I am looking forward to the smell of the cakes as they cook - it is just a most delicious smell!!  I have been using a Good Housekeeping recipe since 2000 when I first found it and used it the week before Christmas!  It worked well even with no time to mature, but it does get a little better with keeping, and so this year it will have about 7 weeks, I think.  Plenty of time!"},
{"title": "Deliveries, visitors and kids playing happily", "date": "Tuesday 28 October 2008", "text": "The day started early with a delivery of books by FedEx for the book party that the FH did for me last week.  Ordinarily, that would have meant that the books could be bagged up and delivered to the party hostess today or tomorrow, but one of the jigsaw books has a piece missing so I have had to re-order and will now have to wait for that to arrive before we can deliver.  I hate to send out imperfect books so we always check, check and double-check that they are all in perfect condition, clean and tidy so that the customers are happy. I pootled around for much of the middle of the day, made some lunch (reheated leftovers so that was really hard work!!) and then moved up a gear when my dad called to say that he was coming over.  We soon had the place looking tidier and then the FGs went out on their bikes with a neighbouring boy and he is still here playing with them now!  My dad visited for about an hour and a half, inspected the garden and the chickens - he always has advice to offer - and then they left as he wanted to get home before dark. It has been lovely to have the children playing together with Playmobil and Nintendos - instead of bickering, there has been laughter which has been very welcome!   The FGs are not used to being together too much now that they are not home-educated; they used to play together very well, but now that they are both in school, they are not so comfortable together and bicker, and compete for attention more.  Just one of the downsides of sending them to school, I think, and kind of a sad one, as they are not as close as they used to be. Tonight I am cooking Toad in the Hole for supper but instead of baking it in the oven, I am cooking it in the Remoska and praying it turns out right.  Remoskas are Polish inventions, and sold in the UK only by Lakeland which is a fantastic chain of shops/online store/mail-order outfit, which started in kitchenware and now sell a huge variety of things.  Anyway, the Remoska is kind of like a big pan with a lid, and the heat comes from an element in the lid, but it only has one temperature which is about 180C, and works OK for most things.  I have cooked casseroles and bolognaise, chops and fish in it, but this is the first time for this dish!  It is great for economising as it uses so much less electricity than the oven so it is cheaper to run.Snow is forecast for tonight, so we are wrapping up warm - hope you and your families are snug tonight!"},
{"title": "Strange smells!", "date": "Monday 27 October 2008", "text": "I am increasingly irritated (I know that I shouldn't let it get to me!) by some TV advertising for air freshener and laundry conditioner.  There is a pair of adverts currently running for new fragrances in the Lenor range - one is White Diamond and something and the other is Black Diamond and Lotus Flower, I think.  Now, today, I have seen an ad for a new room fragrance called \"Glistening Snow\".  \"Glistening Snow\"???????? As far as I know, gemstones and snow don't actually smell of anything........do they?  I'd love to know what these manufacturers think a diamond smells like. I don't use artificial fragrances on our clothes very often - there is an old bottle of cheap store-brand fabric conditioner in the utility room cupboard which I use occasionally in the winter when I know that the FGs' shirts are going to have to be dried indoors, but most of the time our laundry is line-dried outside, sometimes under the verandah but that is still outside - and that gives us the freshest smell: the smell of fresh air!  You just cannot beat it, and all the fabric conditioners in the world will never smell that good.  Similarly, we don't use air fresheners in the house, prefering to open a window and let some fresh air in to take away any stale or unpleasant smells.  I throw open our bedroom windows most mornings, even if it is just for five minutes, and the freshness of the morning air does wonders to wake me up!The FGs are at home from school this week on their half-term holiday.  The EFG has been to a sports centre for the day, playing cricket, benchball and basketball.  She has had a good time with some old friends and made some new ones too - she loves going there and goes each holiday for a couple of days.  The YFG used to go too but she doesn't like it now, so she stayed at home with me and made cookies.  We picked the EFG up at 3 and went in to town to the bank, the Post Office and a clothes shop as the YFG had no jumpers (sweaters) at all for this winter - we were very lucky and got two in her size made of the softest fleece and she is SO happy with them! On the way home, we did some more rural shopping - we stopped at a farm and bought two bales of straw for the rabbits and hens bedding.  Straw has been difficult to buy this autumn but this farm has lots so I will be going back there to buy more but I could only fit two bales into the car today.  A mile or two further along, another smallholder is selling bags of carrots and parsnips, and we picked up two of carrots and one of parsnips.  These are BIG bags, about 15kg or so, I would guess, and the man gets them by the trailerload from local packing houses where carrots and other veg are processed and packed.  These are the ones which don't make it through the quality control and are sold off cheaply.  There is nothing wrong with them: there are a lot of odd-shaped ones and a wide variety of sizes, but they all taste great!  Last year I made lots of soup with them and we had beautiful roasted parsnips all winter........I am looking forward to them on Sunday with a roasted chicken already.I wonder whether The Mom who posts comments occasionally would like to share her recipe for pumpkin loaf cake as I have lost it and now is a great time of year to make it...please?"},
{"title": "Getting there", "date": "Saturday 25 October 2008", "text": "Yesterday I paced myself and got up enough energy to take the YFG back to gymnastics.  We didn't go early to help with the set-up of the equipment as we usually do - we got there about twenty minutes before the class was due to start so we could have a chat with the other coaches!  It was OK and I managed to keep going for the evening, and actually felt well enough after the class to nip into the new Tesco for some fresh fruit and veggies.Yes, I am back on the Tesco topic!  Sorry, but I have to!  The new Tesco has been opened in the nearby town, and it is Huge.  It is also now open 24 hours, six days a week.  The old shop was big enough for a small market town, and there are larger stores in three directions, all about 20 minutes away, where the occasional \"big shop\" at Christmas might get done.  This new store is almost as big as these others, and it now sells clothes, household goods, electrical stuff, has a pharmacy, and has required an extra 150 staff.  The visit last night was interesting, as I can now say that I have been and had a look - but I won't be rushing back.  The size of the shop and all the \"fantastic\" displays are designed to part us from our money, and I am resisting giving them more of ours!  It will also take longer to shop there as there is too much to look at and too far to walk, to start with...How do I plan to shop now, then?  I am going to continue to have my shopping delivered by the supermarket, visit Lidl once a month, and pop into the small Sainsbury's in the town when I need to pick up fruit or veg.  Shopping online means that I can easily keep to a budget, check the cupboards as I am doing the order, and alter it right up to the last hours before the delivery.  I have been using Tesco, but this week I was emailed a special voucher code from Sainsbury's so I am giving them a go next week.  Having the delivery saves me time and also saves me from temptation in the shops!Tonight, the YFG is having her first sleepover at her friend's house around the corner.  I am pleased that she is only a two minute walk away but I am also quite confident that she will be fine.  The FH, EFG and I are sitting here watching \"Strictly Come Dancing\" and marvelling at the progress that some of the celebrities are making from one week to another.  When I have finished this post, I am quite excited to have a couple of new books to explore - \"Better Off\" by Eric Brende, and \"Housewife, 49: the Second World War Diaries of Nella Last\".  Both are books about a really different kind of life and both are books which I really hope to learn from.  I'll tell you more once I have read them."},
{"title": "Fantastic ginger cake", "date": "Thursday 23 October 2008", "text": "This is a lovely recipe for ginger cake - and it even makes two at once, so it is time and energy efficient as well. If you have wheat intolerance as I do, you can substitute barley flour, and dairy intolerant people can sub dairy-free margerine, and it even works if you do both, as I do if I want to eat it myself! It is a very accommodating recipe.I call it \"Beth's Nanna's Ginger Cake\" as it was given to me by Beth's mum when I was childminding Beth, but that was years ago, and I do not remember Beth's surname, and never knew her Nanna at all, so I cannot give any credit for it beyond that - and I have no idea where Beth's Nanna got the recipe - but all credit to her, it is a great cake. If you can bear to leave it a day or two, wrapped up in foil in a tin, it will develop a slightly sticky top. I generally make two and freeze one for another week.So - melt together 12oz golden syrup and 8oz margerine in a saucepan and then leave to cool. In a bowl, sieve together 1lb self-raising flour, 2 tsp salt, 4 tsp ground ginger, 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 1 tsp ground mixed spice and 6 oz caster sugar. In a smaller bowl or a jug, beat together 2 eggs and 2 cups (I use an American cup measuring set) of milk.Once the melted margerine mixture is cool, pour it over the dry ingredients and add the beaten egg and milk, and then mix it all very thoroughly - ideally with a hand-held electric mixer. If you do not mix it well enough, you will find little bubbles of flour in the cooked cake, so it is well worth a few minutes extra beating.The mixture will be quite fluid at this point and not perhaps what you expect cake batter to look like - don't panic - this is OK. Grease and line two 2lb loaf tins and pour half of the mixture into each one. Set both tins onto a baking tray and slide into the oven - I use the bottom shelf and cook at 160 C for about 45 minutes to an hour. When you check it with a metal skewer or knife, the skewer/knife should come out clean if it is done. Let them cool in the tins, and then wrap one in greaseproof paper and foil to eat soon, and put the other into a large freezer bag and pop in the freezer, or give as a gift to a friend!I am still not feeling right, so I am staying at home and resting a lot of the time.  The weather today has not been encouraging at all: yesterday's sunshine was replaced by cloudy skies and strong winds.  The FH has been a taxi driver all day, and isn't finished yet.  He started off by taking the EFG to her school early to catch her bus for the school trip to Hampton Court Palace today (they have been studying the Tudors), then he came home, ate his breakfast and took the YFG up the road to her school.  It was soon time to repeat that trip at 3 to fetch her home and he had to go back again at 4 for her parent-teacher consultation - and he still has to go back to town tonight to fetch the EFG.  She will be later than she expected as she has texted to say that the bus she was on broke down and they have had to wait over an hour for a replacement vehicle.  Luckily, this is her last school day before the half-term holiday so she can sleep in tomorrow morning.Oil prices are still sliding downwards, so I got one company down to £212 today for 500 litres - that was 40.5p/litre - I think that when it gets to a flat 40p, I will order!"},
{"title": "Beautiful day", "date": "Wednesday 22 October 2008", "text": "I said yesterday how few of these clear autumnal days we have had, and lo and behold, we are enjoying one today!  So I went outside with the camera and took some pictures: These are the strawberry plants which the FH was given on Sunday by my uncle.  The ground has had to be prepared to put them in but they are all safely tucked into the raised bed here this morning.  This grey and white rabbit is one of the latest to be born and had never been out of the hutch onto the grass before today so he/she (not sure which yet) was very keen! Mum and sibling came too - you will see that the shadows look long and you would think that perhaps I had taken these photos in the evening but this is our low autumn/winter sun!   \"Can't we come too?\" these bunnies are asking!  Well, no, you can't as we don't mix bunnies now as sometimes they fight when they are not used to being together so only hutch-mates get put out in the run at the same time - maybe these will get a turn later! And here is a final picture of the cat who lives with us; she is not our cat, but she has chosen to live under our verandah.  She was luxuriating in the sunshine this morning and just got up to pose when she saw me with the camera."},
{"title": "Re-organising the house for the winter", "date": "Tuesday 21 October 2008", "text": "In the UK, we will be altering the clocks on Saturday and the darkness will come upon the days more quickly - it will feel more and more like winter.  It feels like we have had a short autumn as the beautifully crisp, clear and sunny days that I think of as typically autumnal have been few this year.  There have been a few, and I have relished them all.  But the cosy days of winter are almost here, and today I have stayed home and moved things around!I am still not feeling well, so I have not been out at all - the FH has been to a school today for me to collect some paperwork, and took his friend with him for a ride.  He has also taken the YFG to school and collected her again.  We have not been to gymnastics tonight as there was just no way that I had the energy for setting out the equipment, supporting gymnasts physically and then putting all the apparatus away again.  I guess I have been hibernating a little, and feel that I will probably continue through this week and maybe into next week.So, today I supervised the moving of the dining table into the living room and got that all sorted out and the room looking cosy and warm for the winter.  I wanted us to have one room that we could eat in, watch tv, read, chat and play in and not have to heat the whole house!  We have throws on the sofa - about 6 or 7 of them now, so there are plenty to snuggle under, and thermally lined curtains which we are now drawing as soon as it begins to get dark. The price of home heating oil is falling here - I could have got 500l for £220 today but I didn't actually place the order as we still have some and I think that the price will drop a little more before too long.  Checking prices is one of my daily chores at the moment - I am waiting to find the best time but I must be careful not to leave it so long that the price starts to rise again, so I will never get the absolute lowest price as I will always chicken out and order some as soon as I think it is low enough.  Considering that earlier in the year, I paid over £300 for 500l, today's price was very good.  I know that I won't leave it much longer!"},
{"title": "Sunday surprise", "date": "Monday 20 October 2008", "text": "Church was different yesterday morning as it had be held in the back room of the village hall since the floor of the church is having to be replaced, at major expense, due to some serious damp problems.  It says in the Bible that whenever a few people meet in God's name, He is there, so it really doesn't matter where we meet.  It will be good to get back to the familiar surroundings of the church when the work is done, though.After church, we came home for a quick cup of tea and then I took the girls to town.  We dropped the YFG off at the leisure centre for the pool party she had been invited to and then we hit the shops for some bargain hunting.  I don't generally approve of shopping on Sundays, but when we have to go to town anyway and there is not a lot else to do in a quiet rural market town at lunchtime on a Sunday, it seemed the best thing to do!  It was not going to be cost effective to come home and then return to fetch her.  We picked up a few things from Lidl, which is a shop I don't often get time to hit, and then went to Tesco as it was the last day of trading for that particular store (a HUGE new one is opening next-door today) so I was hoping for some bargains/reduced items - and I got some!  We then headed off to Sainsbury's as well to round off the shopping trip - and I found some lovely Christmas presents in there: a present for the FH and some stocking fillers for the girls.The party seems to have gone well, and everyone came out of the party room in high spirits, although the mother of the party child looked rather stressed!  We came home to find that we had unexpected visitors - my cousin and her husband.  We don't see them very often, but it was a lovely surprise!  They had arrived about an hour earlier, chatting with the FH, and stayed after we got home for some time, catching up on one another's news.  My uncle (my cousin's father's brother) arrived for the evening, and so they also had a quick opportunity to exchange their news albeit briefly.  My mother was the brothers' sister. My uncle settled in the for evening, and I popped the chicken into the oven.  The FH had already prepared the veggies for me during the afternoon, and I had picked up a cherry pie in my shopping as I know that it is his favourite so my work was minimal for the meal.  A quick session with the ironing board and the uniforms for the girls, and my work was done.  After my uncle left, the girls were in bed for an early night and the FH and I sat down to watch \"A Touch of Frost\" as it is a new series and we do like Jack Frost!  The FH spent some time in the police as a Special constable, and he finds Jack the most realistic copper on the TV these days. I am resting in bed this morning as I have been unwell during the night, so the FH has gone out to do a book delivery on my behalf, and I am hoping to be recovered enough to get back to work tomorrow.  There is nothing major spoiling anywhere, and I need a rest!  Thank goodness for the EFG's laptop so I can stay in touch with the world."},
{"title": "Harvest and cooking show", "date": "Sunday 19 October 2008", "text": "Goodness, no posts since Thursday! Where have I been?! Busy. That is the simple answer but it isn't a good excuse, as we are all busy. Friday saw the YFG's Harvest Festival assembly at school at 9am. In previous years, there has been a Harvest Festival in the local Methodist church that we attend, but it had to be in two parts as the size of the church doesn't accommodate 140 odd children, staff and all their parents. Unfortunately, school growth has pushed even that idea out of the window, and this year, the school have had to institute a new idea - class by class assemblies all through one week. This has meant that parents with more than one child may have attended on several days to see them all. The YFG's came at the end of the week, as the Y4/5 class which she is in did their assembly in conjunction with the Y6 class. They recited some lovely autumn poems, and sang worship songs, which was fantastic. Their singing has improved, and they were brilliant - I was so proud! After the assembly, we were taken into the classrooms to look at some of their work, and that was interesting too. All in all, it was a very impressive morning, and it was wonderful to see real worship incorporated into the assembly.After that, we came home and got started on all the routine chores for the day. The rest of the day was pretty usual, with washing, gymnastics, supper and Wire in the Blood, which the FGs and I watched together, all snuggled up in fleece blankets on the sofa.Saturday - well, what a day! I had to do some banking early on so we did that first, and then went to the gym. We were there until about 1.20pm and then we came home and had some lunch. The YFG then had her friend round to play for the rest of the day, including tea, which was lovely as they do play together really well. After tea, I had to get ready to go out: my sister is a Pampered Chef consultant and she and her recruit, J, had organised a Fundraiser for Breast Cancer, as PC make October their Breast Cancer month and produce some fab pink items for sale only in October. She had phoned me on Thursday and asked me to come along and do part of the cooking, as they were running a \"Ready, Steady, Cook!\" style competition - me cooking Chocolate Fudge Brownies, against my sister's mother-in-law making Mediterranean Vegetable Tartlets. I didn't want to face a roomful of people on my own, so I took along the mother of the little friend who comes to play, and another friend and her mother. I invited another lady from the town, who I see regularly at gym, and she brought along her friend too. So there were six of us in my support group. The trouble was, despite all their promotion efforts, the six of us consisted the whole audience. It was such a shame for them as they had put so much effort into it all and worked so hard to organise it. However, we all won a raffle prize, and the Chocolate Brownies won me the cooking prize, which is the bunch of pink roses! Today promises to be fun too, as we have church at 9.30am then the YFG has a pool party in town for the little friend's birthday. My uncle is then coming to tea tonight, so I have some tidying up and cooking to do later. I also have to get the YFG to do her homework, and then iron the school uniforms. Hope you are all having a good day."},
{"title": "Laughs over a disaster", "date": "Thursday 16 October 2008", "text": "A quick story to chuckle over:  the FH always cooks on Tuesdays as I and the YFG don't get home from gym until about 8.30pm.  This week, I asked him to make an apple crumble for pudding, but was disappointed to get home to find that he hadn't.  He had made the crumble topping with the flour, sugar and Vitalite, but had stopped at that stage in the proceedings because he couldn't find the oats and thought he couldn't make crumble topping without them.  He had then put the mixture in the fridge and left it there.  I went to it last night, added the oats, popped it onto the defrosted apple puree and it went into the oven to cook for 25 minutes.  After we had eaten our main course last night, I went to the kitchen and jokingly said, \"I hope you didn't put salt in this!\" as he had accidentally put salt on his Shredded Wheat yesterday morning, so I took a small mouthful - and had to go and spit it out in the bin - he HAD used salt instead of sugar and that was one ruined crumble!! Moral for me is to make sure that I put salt and sugar in different containers - I had had them in identical IKEA glass jars with lids, but kept in completely different places.  The salt was kept with the breadmaking flour and yeast, as that is its point of use in the kitchen - and probably the only use it has on a day to day basis, although I do use it for scouring the drains now and then!  The sugar was kept with the other flours, and the vanilla essence and general baking bits and pieces; to me they were obvious which was which, but not to the FH! I have left the salt in the IKEA jar but the sugar has been moved to a blue canister which already had SUGAR on the side of it!  Now it really is used for sugar, and we have had a successful crumble tonight - I just couldn't wait another night - I had been looking forward to crumble since Tuesday!!"},
{"title": "The bread of life", "date": "Wednesday 15 October 2008", "text": "Bread - most people in this country would count it as a staple part of their diet. It makes sense, then, to eat a good quality loaf, with plenty of nutrients. Unfortunately, society has been brainwashed to some extent, by the masters of \"convenience\" and \"luxury\" - advertising executives have told us that bought, sliced bread represents the epitome of modern life - who would want to go back to the drudgery of the past, where baking bread was a regular part of daily life, and who wants to be up to their elbows in flour for hours making the bread? Well, those misconceptions have turned us into somewhat of a nation of cheap, sliced, white bread eating people - and that is not a good development.The last time I was in Tesco, it was possible to buy \"value\" white, medium sliced bread for 30p a loaf. A more upscale branded white loaf was costing anything between 90p and £1.50 depending on the brand. How have we been brought to this?The Chorleywood Bread Process was developed in 1961 by the Flour Milling and Baking Research Association, at a place called Chorleywood. UK grown wheat does not have a high protein content, and therefore did not make good bread - apparently, Canadian wheat was the most popular for good bread baking. However, the new process allowed UK wheat to be used, although it means that the nutrients in the bread are of reduced value. But this process also uses bread improvers and a special ingredient that we are totally unable to replicate at home - very high-energy mixing. It is this combination of reduced quality wheat, the addition of chemicals and the faster processing times which makes this bread inadequate. But it gets worse because this bread has added fat, which makes it spongy and light, but is really there to act as a preservative - \"real\" bread goes stale quite quickly. There is no need for fat in real bread.\"Give us this day our daily bread\" - even the Lord's Prayer recognises the importance of fresh bread, made daily. Home-made bread is so much better in so many ways than Chorleywood bread, which makes up about 80% of the bread eaten in the UK today. We don't have to actually make it by hand these days, with the advent of the breadmaker, but there is a very therapeutic feeling about being responsible for the daily loaf. If it is made by hand, the baker has an even bigger input into the loaf, and probably more fun!A fresh loaf, enough for the family to enjoy on a day to day basis, can easily be made in the breadmaker or by hand. When making bread by hand, I find it time-efficient to make several loaves and freeze the surplus for busy days.1961 brought this mass-produced, quickly made bread to the shelves, and it co-incided with so many other things in the sixties - they were a time of change, and the bought, ready-sliced and wrapped loaf fitted in with those developments - more women in the workforce and not at home during the day, needing \"fast\" food to feed hungry families. It is no wonder that we as a nation easily fell into the trap of buying this stuff. I cannot remember my mother ever making a loaf of bread at all, although she was an excellent cook and made cakes and pastries as well as traditional meals every night. My father's family were bakers - three generations of them, and there is still a professional baker in my generation although he works for a big bakery nowadays. My grandfather had an old-fashioned bakery, rising early to bake that day's bread, and then (so he tells me) my father and his brothers helped to deliver the bread around the village on bicycles. Unfortunately that bakery business had to close down and although I don't know exactly when, I would have to say that it is probable that the rise of the Chorleywood loaf would have contributed to the closure of numerous such small bakeries in countless small villages.I have one of my grandfather's very old cake tins which he would have used to bake round fruit cakes in, and whenever I use it, I think of him and the traditions that we are losing - we can stop that loss if we recognise it, and try to appreciate that not everything modern and new is necessarily a good thing! There is never a better time than right now to reclaim our history and our heritage and take control for ourselves of things which we have within our ability to change. Go and make a loaf of bread today and make a start on that change!"},
{"title": "Harvesting gold", "date": "Tuesday 14 October 2008", "text": "This is today's harvest from the garden - this is probably the last of the runner beans, but this is just the first of the baby carrots.  I am very excited about these as they are the first variety I have ever managed to grow successfully, and I think it is because they are small and round, instead of being long and thin!  They are a little small and could have done with a little longer growing but I was impatient to see what they were like, so I have pulled some, and left a lot to grow for a little longer.  I think that these will be wonderful for lunch with some salad of cress, apple and tomatoes, and perhaps some lettuce if we have any ready.  Raw will be the best way to eat them, as they will be fresh and sweet, I hope!"},
{"title": "Photos from the show", "date": "Monday 13 October 2008", "text": "This is a lovely bunch of chrysanthemums which I got from the local horticultural society's stall as they were packing up. They were selling off their displays of fruits, vegetables and flowers. As well as these, I also brought home cabbages, a cauliflower, broccoli, russet apples (my favourite!) and some cyclamen which are further down this post. The FGs are on the horses on the left - one in jeans and one in black - going away from me to protect their privacy. They love this carousel and always want to ride it. This photo (above) shows the huge new building. Almost in the middle of the shot you can see a shorter white pole and just to the right of it is a set of blue doors. We were just inside those doors and benefitted from a good flow of potential customers streaming in that way. These are the cyclamen - now on the kitchen window sill to brighten my washing-up chores. They are beautiful!We were pleased with the display of books that we were able to provide - this is the front of the stand and it was 4 metres long. That's quite a lot of books!  This is the other side of the stand - we had a depth of three metres AND we had a corner pitch so we made the most of it and allowed the customers to come into the stand area by using more tables placed back to back with those in the picture above, and then using these wooden racks at the back of the stall. The FH made all these racks and they are wonderful for displaying all my books!  As the customers approached the stall from this direction, I think that they had a pretty impressive sight, and I was pleased with it! The Showground has a new building called \"exec\" and that is where we were located. It is Huge, and we were able to drive the car and trailer into the building for the unloading and reloading, which saved an enormous amount of effort! Usually in the past, we have had to put all the boxes of books onto trolleys and haul them out to the car park. We were in an area of general shopping, and also in the building were the rabbit show, rat/mice shows, and the pigeon show! It did get a little noisy, but at least the chickens were in another building or I think it would have got too loud! Sales in this economic market were expected to have been down, as people are supposed to be keeping a lid on their spending. However, our sales for the day were almost exactly the same as last year, give or take £10, so we were very happy with that. I was talking with the FH last night and we wondered whether some people have bought books from us this year who perhaps might have bought more expensive gifts in the past - but books are excellent gifts in any economic climate, and we have some regular customers who keep coming back, and it was great to recognise them and ask how the gifts they bought last year were recieved!The layout of the show was not great, but it was the first year that this new building has been in use for this show, and the craft fair was not put in with us; this led to a massive slump in sales for some of the traders and craftspeople who were in that area - my friend took a 50% drop in her sales, just because the footfall through the area was so reduced. The FGs had a tiring day, but full of ups and downs - they did some shopping, had some \"watching the world go by\" moments, read a bit, played on DSs a little, signed up for the Record attempt at the World's Largest Roast Dinner, and generally wore themselves out walking, walking, walking! I wore myself out standing in one place all day! They were very good, as always, and I treated them to a ride on the carousel - it is a bit of a tradition at the show, and they love riding the horses and try to find their favourites each time!  I'll put that photo in the next post as this one doesn't want to let me put it down here!"},

{"title": "Quick photo call", "date": "Saturday 11 October 2008", "text": "I didn't get these uploaded yesterday, so here are the rabbits enjoying the sunshine and yes, that is my shadow - I am not renowned for my photography and I think that that is probably quite a common mistake! The two rabbits on the left are female Dutch rabbits, born earlier in the year. The hutch next to them has the three white rabbits - who are nameless as we can't tell the difference between them. They were very skinny when we got them and are only now, months later, beginning to put weight on. They are also female. They are put into a big run on the grass when the weather is nice.Here we have a closer shot of one of the white ones enjoying the sun. She sat like this for some while, obviously very contented. And finally - the latest on the chicks! They are growing well, beginning to get wing feathers now, and very keen to be using them - they keep flying up to perch on the rim of the pen they are in, so we have had to put a wire lid over them! We have had a long day!  The YFG and I went to gymnastics this morning from 9.30 until 1pm, and then raced home to get changed and go with the FH and EFG to the showground to set the stall out for the Autumn show tomorrow.  It took ages!  We unloaded everything and then had to construct the racks, organise where to put everything - which can get very fraught at times, when I want to put something in one place and the FH thinks it should go elsewhere - but we managed.  We then came home and I cooked a quick tea of sausages and mashed potatoes, followed by ginger cake (I'll post the recipe for that sometime soon - it is Good!) and now I have finished the kitchen cleanup and just need to make some posters for tomorrow.  I will try to remember to take the camera so that I can take some pictures around the show and of the stall."},
{"title": "Friday again - they keep coming!", "date": "Friday 10 October 2008", "text": "The days are passing by so quickly!  We spent this morning packing the books into boxes and loading the trailer up.  It was heavy work, lifting the book boxes and sorting things out.  We were very glad of a rest and a cup of tea sitting under the verandah in the sun.  The weather was lovely here today - fresh and clear with beautiful blue skies.  The washing was blowing in the wind and was dry in no time at all and I Love the smell of line-dried laundry.As the days are growing shorter now and the sun doesn't manage to rise as high in the sky, the shadows are lengthening and some areas of the garden don't get into the sun at all.  This has meant that the time had come today to reposition the rabbit hutches for the winter.  The winter position would be far too hot for them in the summer, and similarly, they would freeze if left in the summer position for the winter.  Where we have them now, in the winter position, is in the best place for the maximum amount of sunshine and warmth for them during the shorter days.  It faces south, so if the sun comes out at all, they will benefit.  Once we had moved them, they positively basked in the sun - they had probably fogotten what it had felt like.  I hope that they have a few nice days this weekend to enjoy it before it starts to rain again!Gymnastics tonight, then we nipped off to Tesco before coming home to home-made fish and chips.  We watched \"Wire in the Blood\" but I confess to not entirely understanding the storyline tonight, and now the FH is watching his all-time favourite programme, \"Have I Got News for You\".  It is on the BBC, so you can probably get it in the US.  Paul Merton is exceptionally witty in the FH's opinion, although I prefer Stephen Fry on QI.So, I was going to mention stockpiling yesterday and didn't get around to it, so I am going to write my thoughts on it tonight.  I keep a good store of things in the house for a number of reasons.  The first is that we live about 10 miles from a supermarket and so I can't keep running to the shops every time I use something up.  The second is that I am not that keen on shopping, so it makes sense to me to buy stuff in bulk and then have to do it less often.  Between those two reasons, I generally do a \"big\" shop for the bulk of the stuff about once every two or three weeks when I will buy all the basics.  More often than that, perhaps twice a week, I will stop by the supermarket and buy fresh fruit and some veggies.  We do eat a lot of fruit, and so I need to keep that topped up. Proper stockpiling is more than that - it would really involve having a few months' worth of provisions in stock, and I am aiming towards this in the long term.  I do buy a lot of some things like loo roll when they go on sale - loo roll is a case in point, as we have about 10 packets of 4.  There was a great sale on them a couple of weeks ago and so I bought them - we are always going to need loo roll!!!!  However, that would also work for tinned and packet goods, flour, yeast and things that we need to use all the time in our cooking and baking, as well as paper goods in the house, female sanitary provisions, toiletries, etc.  I do have two freezers and so I have a good supply there of stone fruits, apples, pears, berries, beans, peas - things we have grown ourselves or have been given by friends or relatives who have grown them.  There is not actually very much in the freezers that I have bought.  The danger with freezers is what to do in the event of a power cut!  The answer is to keep them very tightly closed, and cover them with heavy blankets in a prolonged power cut in the hope of insulating them as long as possible - ours are outside under the verandah so they will be pretty chilly at this time of year!  We don't have a lot of major power cuts where we live, so we get by.So, why would I recommend stockpiling to any extent?  First and foremost, it is a security blanket for me - I know that if money is scarce, I can still feed the family.  Living what is called \"hand to mouth\" is a very precarious existence, where the wage earner is literally going out that week (or even that day) to earn the cash to feed the family.  I would hate to live like that - and I probably have a month's supplies in the house - OK, I am sure that some of the combinations for meals towards the end of the month might get a little strange, but we would be fed!  I know that if I want to set some extra money aside for something in particular, I can shop from home for a week instead of going to the supermarket, and save a lump sum quite quickly.  The stores should always be rotated, so you are eating from the stock all the time and then replacing the food later.  In the event of a disaster, emergency or fuel strike, I know that my family will be fed, and that makes me feel better! My stockpile as it is at the moment has been built up over years, buying a few extra bits now and then.  I have tinned fish, tinned fruit, corned beef, tinned beans, etc - I will do a complete list in the weeks to come.  And I will get to the Chorley-Wood bread process soon too.I will be busy over the weekend with the show and preparations for it, so I may not post again until Monday - have a good weekend, everyone!"},
{"title": "More thoughts!", "date": "Thursday 9 October 2008", "text": "Wow - we had five girls in the house this afternoon!  I know a couple of my friends have four or even five kids of their own, but I guess you get used to the way of life one child at a time.  My two are quiet in comparison to having five around, and these were well-behaved additions, I am pleased to be able to say.  They are a family from church - one is the same year at school as the EFG, one is a Y6, so one year ahead of the YFG, and the little one is Y2 and very cute; the YFG dotes on her.  They slotted into the family here very well and they all get on together.  They all spent time outside on the trampoline and then the smaller three snuggled up together and watched part of a DVD whilst the older two were upstairs doing what 12/13 year olds do best - chatting!  They stayed for tea and were so effusive with their praise of my cooking that I told them they could come back anytime - the middle one loved the chocolate slab cake and advised that I could open a bakery!  It is so nice to be appreciated.This morning I went out and sold some books at a playgroup.  This has become a tradition at this particular group as I have been there in October every year since I began selling Usborne.  They hold a coffee morning and the mums (and dads, sometimes) gather to chat and buy bits and pieces - I was there with the books, there was a Chocoholics lady, and a Body Shop person.  I know who sold most and it wasn't either of them!  Yes, I sold just over £250 of books in just under an hour and a half, and I was very pleased with that.  I have been worried with the \"global financial crisis\" as the BBC like to call it, that people would be careful this Christmas and sales would be down, but not this morning - mums were handing over £20 notes and flashing credit and debit cards like nobody's business!  The playgroup were pleased as I was able to give them £50 worth of books for free.  I do love that bit of this business as groups which are always short of cash but trying to do their best for children benefit from the sales that I do in that way - and the leader was a bit overwhelmed at the thought of getting to choose so many books for the children.Today is a day in the middle of two birthdays - my late grandmother would have been 105 yesterday but she died in September 2002 days short of her 99th birthday.  My dad turns 79 tomorrow, so I have sent him a birthday card and phoned him for a chat tonight as I know that he and I both have busy days tomorrow.  He lives about 15 - 20 miles away, near Huntingdon and we see him about once a fortnight or so.  He is in generally good health but has some problems with his heart which are long-term but under control. Well, I was going to tell you about Chorley-Wood bread and stockpiling tonight, but I have run out of time so I'll leave that for another day.  If you get a minute, Google (funny how we all recognise that as a verb these days!) Chorley wood and you will begin to understand why home-made bread is best!"},
{"title": "Growing well", "date": "Wednesday 8 October 2008", "text": "There are still some things growing in the Fen garden in October - we are still harvesting runner beans and will be enjoying these tonight (although the FH says I should have left some of these on the plants to become seeds for next year).Here are some lettuces which are growing away in the greenhouse - the temperature in there today in the sun was over 100C, so we have put it in the right place to capture the warmth.These tomatoes were taken off the vines last weekend and are ripening in the greenhouse. The taste is magnified when you eat a home-grown tomato - a supermarket tomato pales in comparison! And here we have some cress, again enjoying the warmth of the greenhouse! And finally, the quail basking in the sun. We have put a blanket over the top of the cage and they have stopped trying to jump up - they were hitting their heads, and it looked painful. They will be better when they are in a proper aviary, but as a temporary home, they seem content to sit in the warmth and relax.  The front of the cage is wired, so they are still getting plenty of light and air, and they are not directly in the sun. Having spoken yesterday to another quail-keeper, the FH has found out that these quail may indeed all be female although their markings differ as it may just be that they are different kinds of quail. We are still waiting for that first egg to be laid, but since we don't know exactly how old they are, we will have to be patient; quail are apparently able to lay eggs from 50 days of age, so they should be approaching that soon, we hope."},
{"title": "Waves to Goosey!", "date": "Tuesday 7 October 2008", "text": "A new reader has joined us - hope you have a great holiday!Today has been one of those days for the FH - he had his flu jab yesterday and has felt rotten all day today. He is always like this and declares each year that he would rather take his chances getting the flu than feel like this after the injection - but he still goes and has it! He had a headache last night and didn't sleep well, so when he woke up this morning and still had the bad head, he decided to sleep it off. He got up at around 11, and mooched around the garden, inspecting the rabbits and chickens, and then went into the shed where the chicks are living. He thought that we should increase the area of the pen that they are in because they have grown (must take another photo for you) and went to move the heatlamp - Big Mistake - he accidentally hit it against something and broke it! And he had only bought that one on Sunday (forgot to tell you that one broke then, perhaps?) so he had to go out this afternoon and get another one! I (being a wise woman!) had told him on the two previous occasions that he should buy two to save special trips but he resisted and just got one each time - guess what, though? He bought two today!I have made biscuits for the girls today - a similar recipe to the last one, indeed a bit of a variation on it, but made with peanut butter instead of chocolate chips. Since I don't fancy trying to melt peanut butter, I mix the peanut butter with the sugar in a creamed mix, then add the rest of the ingredients, but this makes quite a dry, crumby mixture that won't hold together - so I add two eggs for the binding. I then take small handfuls, roll them in my hands before putting them on the baking trays, and then flatten them gently with a fork. They are quite solid biscuits and much less prone to spreading out than the choc chip variety. These are not for taking to school in case there is anyone about with an allergy to peanuts, so the girls and FH enjoy them at home.This afternoon, the YFG and I were at gymnastics again, which was fun although hard work. We are preparing for a competition in November, and so 15 of the gymnasts are learning floor routines with the choreographer, K, as well as trying to perfect their vaults. It is just a two-piece competition, so that is all they have to do. There will be one in March next year which will be four pieces, so they will have more to learn. K had a car crash recently and is without a car, so we took her home afterwards, popped into a school PTA meeting to tell them about the books I sell, and then came home for tea - the YFG is completey pooped, poor girl, and was at the crotchety stage of tiredness.The FGs are loving their \"winter\" beds - I have bought them each a set of old-fashioned flannelette sheets: I got them hugely reduced from Roseby's in Cambridge in August as obviously no-one else wanted that sort of thing in August and they were desperate to get rid! So they are snuggling down between the sheets, with a duvet over the top and then, on cold nights, a blanket or fleece over that. The EFG has now taken to asking to be \"tucked in\", which she hadn't bothered about for years, and is now 12! It is lovely to tuck them in, though, so I don't mind. I haven't come up with a washing plan yet, though; I only got one pair each, and I don't have a tumble drier so they will have to be off the beds for a day or three when they are washed so I think that they will have to go back to normal sheets - unless I can find some more reasonably priced ones somewhere this week.....It has been striking today how warm the wind has become overnight - we have gone from very chilly weather to mild but blustery winds.  The thick winter coats weren't needed today and I was walking around the garden in a polo shirt without a jumper.  The vagarities of the English weather are a mystery, but a pleasant surprise at times.  There were certainly no worries about putting the heating on today.The YFG is going to a friend's house after school tomorrow, and I have to take the EFG to her exercise class, so I will get an hour to myself in town - unheard of!! A trip to the library and a few shops will be in order, and I need to collect some change from the bank for the show at the weekend, so that will be top of the list."},
{"title": "Musical Mondays", "date": "Monday 6 October 2008", "text": "We have a big Book show coming up when we will be selling at the East of England showground's annual Autumn Show, being held this coming Sunday.  This meant that we needed to go through the stock and see where the gaps were, and then file an order to remedy the gaps, if you see what I mean.  This took up most of the morning, but it has been done and then there will be a lot of sorting out to do when all the boxes arrive later in the week.  The FH and I were busily scanning the bookshelves when all of a sudden I noticed the time, and had to send the FH scurrying to the car as he had an appointment for a flu jab, and only had 10 minutes to travel 8 rural miles to the surgery!  My trans-atlantic reader will know that a \"rural\" mile around here can take longer to travel than normal!!  He arrived in time, and came home with a sore arm.I cycled to school and back today with the YFG, so I travelled 4 miles to her 2, but I hope it was worth the exercise - it has been the first fine day for a week today and I really wanted to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine.  Sunshine - yes!  The temperature in the greenhouse was in the 90s this morning by 9 am so I had to open the rooflight to ventilate it for the quail - I don't want the eggs baked before they are laid, not that any have actually started to lay yet.  The chickens are not happy in this current cold snap that we are having and have dropped production to one a day between them - which is not good!  I have had to buy eggs tonight to be able to bake tomorrow.This evening we have all been to band practice - my euphonium skills are improving, I am told!  It is lovely to be doing something as a family, although I think that it may be next Christmas before we can play carols together.  I managed to play half the C-scale tonight, so that was an improvement on last week.  Our teacher is in his early seventies and has been playing for 64 years, so I have a long way to go.  He plays a tuba, but seems to know how to teach us all these different things so I guess his experience is wide ranging.I have ordered myself a book by Cath Kidston from the the discount internet BookPeople website, and I am hoping that it will have some simple things in it that I can have a go at.  I have downloaded some instructions from the net for the sewing machine and will be setting aside some time at the weekend (no, the show is on this weekend, so maybe the next!) to get the machine out and see if I can sort it out.  There are some really great tutorials on the internet that I looked at one day last week, and I want to have a go at some of these things too - pencil cases, shoe bags, basket linings, etc, but my trouble is TIME - there just isn't enough of it.   I could sleep less, I guess, but I'd feel so bad that it wouldn't be worth it.The chicken feed was delivered this afternoon so that took about 45 minutes to move it from where it was unloaded on the driveway to the shed for storage.  There were 22 bags to move, each weighing in at 20kg, so they were Heavy.  I took three at a time in the wheelbarrow, but had to take a circuitous route around the garden to get round the raised beds, whereas the FH took 2 at a time on a trolley but was able to take a straighter route because the trolley was narrower and could get through the gaps more easily.  Between us, we got them all put away safely.  I don't know how long they will last because we have bought layers' mash, growers' pellets, chick crumbs and mixed corn, and they are all used at different rates for the various birds; I think that the chick crumbs will be enough for the baby chicks until they are ready to go onto growers' pellets, so we may be OK for about three months, I hope!  There is enough mash for longer than that - we had to order 25 bags (a friend took 3 bags of corn) to get it delivered, so it was a bit of guesswork this time.  The prices are excellent though - Bearts of Stowbridge, if anyone needs animal feed!Have to go and do some ironing before I head to the bath, so will send hugs to those I know and good wishes to everyone else!"},
{"title": "Two days pass in a blur!", "date": "Saturday 4 October 2008", "text": "Yesterday and today have passed in a blur, quite literally! Friday morning was taken up with general chores and then a school meeting that went on until lunchtime. I came home, ate some lunch, watched the news (something I do more often at the moment whilst all this financial/economic stuff is happening!), cleaned out a couple of the chicken houses, had to have a shower and then went to gym. After gym, we ate, and watched Wire in the Blood, then I had to do a bit of work on the computer with a couple of DVDs from gym. Watching other coaches is really helpful to get ideas for teaching, but I really need to sit down with a pen and paper and make notes, which I didn't, so I'll need to watch again more carefully!This morning was a rerun of most Saturday mornings - get up, fling a load of school clothes in the washing machine, get everyone up, sort the poultry, hang the washing, pack a snack and get going! We picked up a little friend from town to come and play for the afternoon, who is now staying the night, and came home. She was fascinated with all the birds, and wanted to hold a rabbit, which she has done, and been chuffed with herself.You will have noticed the prevalence of visiting children lately! As I said the other day, I don't mind and I would much rather that these children feel welcome and happy to come here than my children disappear off to play in the streets. There is a bit of a protective mother in there, but there is also the fact that there are limited opportunities in a small, rural village for children to get together other than on the street, so I would prefer that they played at home. The weather hasn't been great today so although they did go out on the trampoline for a while, they have been plaiting hair, drawing, watching \"Ballet Shoes\", playing on the computer, looking after the hamster, chatting and generally just having fun together.I have been reading other people's views on the huge influence that Tesco exerts on us all in myriad different ways. We have currently got a fairly small supermarket on the outskirts of the nearest town which is a Tesco, but they are preparing to open a huge one there on the 20th of this month; it will be a 24 hour opening one, and is about 3 times the size of the current one. I realise that the current one is small compared to most these days, but it is a good size and carries most of what people generally want to buy, but it seems that perhaps Mr Tesco, or the powers that be, think that a bigger shop might make more money because it has the space to sell a wider range of products. I would like to move away from shopping at Tesco, but the unfortunate reality of the local shops is that I would find it hard to buy basic goods such as flour, sugar, teabags, etc. I could go (I do, but not regularly) to a butcher for meat, and to a veg shop for greengrocery, although we are growing more ourselves, and I can get toiletries from chemists, but where do I go for the basics? The only place I can think of is a wholefood co-op in Cambridge which neither sells exactly what I want to buy nor is conveniently placed - it is over 30 miles away and charges \"wholefood\" prices, rather than \"normal\" prices - I do accept that I am not going to get things at prices comparable to Tesco \"Value\" prices outside of that store.In the present situation, I feel trapped in the shadow of Tesco. It is cost-effective to shop there because I can get most of the shopping there and that reduces the car journeys I need to make - it would be a completely different scenario if I lived in the small town in Scotland where I lived for about 8 years. There was a butcher, a greengrocer, several chemists, a \"pound\" shop for bits and pieces, a small Co-op, and a Lidl. I walked from shop to shop, putting the purchases under my pram and often picking up fresh fruit and meat or fish daily. We often remark upon the time we used only one tank of diesel in a three month period because we hardly used the car - we could walk to the doctor, the dentist, the shops, playgroup, etc and it was great. I get the feeling that I am stuck in the rural village we have chosen to live in, and because we have to be economical with fuel and time these days, I cannot practically manage to live in all the ways we would if things were different. We also run two cars now whereas then we got on fine with just the one.So, living in the Fens has its bad points, but we chose to live here for the space and the generous sized house that we enjoy - so the good points of this include benefits such as the room to grow produce, to have the poultry, to stockpile and to enjoy the wide, open skies. I'll keep thinking about the Tesco issue, and maybe (Maybe?) challenge myself to stay away for a while and see how I get on - but should I avoid all supermarkets or just that one? Will think about that and report back. Another cockerel on the menu for tomorrow, so I will have to take the plucker a cup of tea!I got my car back yesterday, but the chap from the garage had to come and get it on Thursday afternoon. I had arranged to drop it off to him on Thursday morning, so I dropped the YFG off to school in the FH's car, and then came home to take mine to the garage - and it didn't even have a flicker of life in the battery - not a glimmer! So the mechanic had to come and tow it into the garage, but he worked his magic on it and it is back in fine form today, thank goodness. The FH needed his car today so I am very relieved that I got mine back.I have had a word with my sister about the sewing machine this evening but she doesn't really kow much about it but I have found a website which has downloadable Singer instruction booklets.  I have taken down three of them and so when I can work out which machine I have, I may be able to make it work.  I would really like to, because I found some beautiful things that I would love to have a go at making.  I don't want to buy a new machine - in fact, I won't because I am not sufficiently good at it to make it worthwhile - but there are several machines in the family so I should be able to make one of them work for me!I failed in the attempt to keep the heating off until November.  The YFG went to bed last night wearing her pyjamas and her school fleece and her slippers to bed, so I guessed she was feeling chilly.  This afternoon, when we brought her friend home to play, the house was like an icebox and whilst it is fine for us to wrap up like Eskimos, it is a bit much to expect your guests to keep their coats on, so I had to put the heat on for a while in her honour."},
{"title": "Quiet day", "date": "Thursday 2 October 2008", "text": "It's good to have quiet days now and again!  Housework, cooking, reading, ironing, the animal care, baking bread, cuddling the kids whilst watching The Bill.  The YFG had a friend to play after school - yes, that little girl yet again, but I don't mind as I am pleased that kids like coming here to play: it means that I can easily keep in touch with who they are playing with and keep a check on their behaviour!  She stayed for tea, which was sausage plait and baked beans, a family favourite.The weather here has been very fresh today - I am trying to stay positive and evoke a thought of fresh, bright autumnal days, rather than cold, damp days - I know that those days are coming and that they are probably not that far away.  We are not putting the heating on until the 1st November, I am determined!  We have to make a date to go by, or we would just put it on anyway, but whilst the EFG is walking around in just a Tshirt and trousers, we don't need it on.  She did ask me tonight when we would be putting it on, and I pointed out that she could put on a jumper (sweater) if she was cold - she wasn't cold enough to go and fetch one, though!I spent a while looking at some tutorials on the net this morning for home-made gifts, which inspired me to dig out the old sewing machine, and some fabric.  The sewing machine is a hand-operated Singer and it is OLD!  It has some problems with tension in the stitches, so I need to talk to my sister about it, or see if I can find any info on the net about it.We brought the quail outside into the greenhouse as we were worried that they weren't getting enough light where they were in the shed - they were with the little chicks.  Hopefully they will soon start to lay some eggs!Go to go to bed soon - early meeting at school tomorrow, so need to be in gear and ready to go!"},
{"title": "All go here", "date": "Wednesday 1 October 2008", "text": "There was a spot of bother this morning when I went to sort out the poultry this morning - the heat lamp over the chicks had stopped working for one reason or another. That necessitated a frantic ring round of all the local possible suppliers to find a stockist, and then a trip off to fetch one. I don't know how long they were without heat but they all seem fine so far.I have had a bit of a tidy up this morning and then I cooked a hot meal for lunch for a change. It meant that tonight, when I cooked macaroni cheese (except it wasn't macaroni but fusili) for the family, I wasn't really hungry and just had some hot pudding - it was one of my favourites - pear crumble and custard.The FGs had some friends round after school - three sisters from church - for chatting and playing, which was fun. Their mum came too as she is interested in the chickens so we had a tour of the various chicken runs whilst the girls were playing. It was lovely to connect with someone else who shares some of our values. We ended up chatting until about 5.30pm when they had to leave to go home to look after their dogs and cook tea.The economic times we are living in now are hard, and people are encountering all sorts of problems. We are blessed to have no mortgage to worry about, and no debts hanging over us. We live on pensions and so our incomes are relatively secure at the moment, and my earnings from bookselling never amount to a fortune, a couple of thousand a year at the most - and that gets swallowed up in the \"treats\" that we have (like a new computer or a short holiday), or it gets saved, but it is never counted as a part of our regular income because it isn't! I am not old enough to have experienced the deprivations of life during the war, but my father and uncle are, and the FH remembers some of the time after the war when rationing was still in force. It was a time of making do, of re-use, and of reducing one's needs, and I think that that sort of scenario is one that we are returning to here. A friend let me know today that the shop she works in has started its \"sale\" and it is a clothing shop that I use when I need new clothes, but I am not going to rush over there this week as there is nothing that I need. A few years ago, I would have gone and probably snapped up a few bargains, as I would have thought of them, and then they would have languished in the bottom of the wardrobe!Rhonda has an excellent list of 20 ways to survive tough times, and I am relieved to find that I am doing at least half of these things, and working on the rest! Have a look at http://www.down---to---earth.blogspot.com/ where you will be able to see how you are getting on compared to her suggestions - and I reckon that they are all excellent ideas!PS The car is going into the garage to have the new alternator fitted tomorrow morning, so I am hoping to have it back in full working order by Friday afternoon.  Thank goodness for friendly, honest and reliable local mechanics."},
{"title": "Not sure if all is still well today!", "date": "Tuesday 30 September 2008", "text": "The only thing actually wrong is that my car needs a new alternator.  Not being mechanically-minded, I am not sure exactly what one of those looks like, or even does, but I do realise that it is fairly essential to have one in working order and that it is something to do with the battery.  Now my car is pretty ancient, and I have had it for ten years - and it was second-hand when we got it!  It has served us fantastically well and I would be very sorry to see it put to rest, and so if it needs a new alternator, it shall have one.  I would like to keep it going for another year or so at least as it is so useful for hauling chicken feed, shopping, books, straw bales, etc.  I don't want to add more metal to the scrapheap either, and I certainly don't \"need\" a new car for cosmetic reasons.  If you know me, you will know that I don't \"go a bundle\" on what things look like, and as long as they are functional and do the job, I am usually happy.  I do need a reliable car, as travelling from here to the nearest towns is 8 miles in either direction, and I dread breaking down on lonely roads.  Enough said, or I will talk it into collapsing!  It will be fine later in the week.On another, more cheery note, I have received two more birthday gifts today - one from a friend through the post - a lovely Mulberry scented candle, and a plant from a friend at gym.  He gave me one last year, and it is still alive, so I am hoping to keep this one alive too - the FH jokes that my plants have to be drought-resistant to live long here.The FH and I have been practising our instruments today - he with more success than I but I will persevere.  I keep collapsing in fits of giggles at the strange shapes I am supposed to be making with my mouth, but I will get used to it soon and then it won't seem so strange!I have also been looking for some fleece material to make some more throws for the sofas and beds for the winter.  The cheapest I have found it on the internet is £4.25 a metre, so I will keep looking for a day or two, but that isn't a bad price.  I'd probably have to look at buying about 10m, so I really want to find a good price, and there is only one shop around here that sells fabric.  To be fair, I haven't checked their price, but I doubt it will be as cheap as that, as they are a shop with overheads to cover, but the side of me which wants to support local shops is telling me that I should at least go in there and check out what they have.  So that will be a job for Saturday afternoon.I have sourced some much cheaper chicken feed from Bearts of Stowbridge, near Downham Market, and they are so much cheaper than what I have been paying that I am kicking myself that I didn't check wholesale delivered prices before.  Sure, I have to buy 25 bags, but with the laying hens, the grower flock, the little chicks and the quail, we have a lot to feed!  I have to order by Friday and they will deliver early the next week, which sounds great to me."},

I got the FGs off to school, sorted the poultry, did some basic tidying and then I went back to bed....I was so tired after the Macmillan preparations and not having the chance to catch up on my sleep over the weekend, that I just had to give in and sleep today.  I got up again at about 2pm in time to have a snack and get myself in gear before it was time to pick up the YFG from school.We have been to band tonight, and not only did the FH sign up for the trombone, but I got roped in too!  I started off with the flugelhorn but that wasn't working terribly well, so I moved across to the euphonium, with which I got on much better, and managed to play some of the C-scale, so I was very pleased with myself!So, there isn't much to report today since I was asleep for a lot of it, but all is well."},

They weren't too happy with the camera today, and that is why they were all huddling at the back of the pen - I had disturbed them from their nap!  When they sleep, their heads are most often laid out on the ground in front of them.  I was not used to seeing chicks asleep, as those we had had previously had all had \"mother hens\" and so when they slept, they were under the mother.  The first time I saw them sleeping in this position, I had a terrible urge to go and find tiny pillows for them to rest their heads on - so soppy and silly, but unfortunately true...We were at church this morning, and then home to continue the birthday celebrations - well, I relaxed with the newspaper and a cup of tea for an hour or two before I cooked the lunch, and then had another relaxing snooze until about 3!  Then I had to do some work, so I got changed and started on the chickens and a little bit of digging.  It was only a little bit, and I have spent some time watching the chickens - the addition of extra hens to the laying flock has meant some rearrangement of the pecking order.  They will take a few days to sort themselves out, and then I hope that the newer birds will start to think about laying some eggs! I have had some lovely cards from friends and family, as well as some cute earrings from my sister, and Turkish Delight and a couple of new books from the FGs.

There was a steady trickle of people coming and going all morning and the baking I had done went down very well.  I'll have to make more lemon sponge next year as that all went first.  There was a raffle and a tombola which were very keenly supported, and the stalls all did some business.  With a cancer charity, most people's lives have been touched in one way or another, and so people are usually quite generous in their support, so I felt that for a small village, we had done well.  I took the leftover chocolate traybake and some lemon buns to gymnastics last night and the mums soon made donations to take some home with them - and that raised a little more, although most of them were having to dredge their pockets for loose change as they had not known we would have cakes there, so had not all brought purses. It added another pound or two to the total.This morning was gym again, and then a little shopping, then home to the garden.  The YFG cut the back lawn and I did the front one, and the EFG and FH had already been clearing the veg plants out of the beds as most of them have finished producing now.  The girls have both got friends round playing now, and one little girl is here to tea (same girl as last weekend!) and to sleepover tonight.On the way home from gym today, we went on a back road for a change, and saw the most glorious sight - a field full of bright orange pumpkins!  It was a beautiful sight, and I was so sorry that I hadn't got the camera in the car.  I was similarly regretful that I hadn't got it when a beautiful hot air balloon skimmed the rooftops this afternoon - the children were on the trampoline with their friends and they were waving to the balloonist, who was waving back!  The weather today has been typically autumnal: thick fog this morning giving way to bright blue skies, crisp sunshine and a fresh touch to the air. Tomorrow is my birthday and I share it with some wonderful females whom I have met at various stages of my life - Becky who I sat next to in GCSE Maths classes, Zoe from A level Geography (both of them actually share the same birth date in the same year - and we were all born in the same city!) and Ailidh, who is much younger, but I was her childminder when she was small.  We'll see if it brings any surprises - today already brought a card from my dad - the card encourages me to do all I can to stay young looking, because if I look young, my dad should too!  Leaving it until you are 40 odd to have me was not a good plan for looking young when I am turning 36!!"},
{"title": "Preparation day", "date": "Thursday 25 September 2008", "text": "Big day tomorrow - the Macmillan coffee morning is tomorrow!  It seems to have come round really quickly, and all of a sudden there was a huge list of things to get done!  I have set the room up, been shopping for last minute bits and bobs, done a load of baking tonight, and there is still more to do in the morning, so I am going to go to bed now and set the alarm to wake me up at 5.  Will probably not post the results until Saturday as I have gymnastics tomorrow afternoon, so that will keep me occupied tomorrow.  Had both the FGs at home today with sore throats, coughs and colds, but have dosed them up with honey and lemon and they will be back at school tomorrow!"},
{"title": "Catching up", "date": "Wednesday 24 September 2008", "text": "Monday night's dinner was superb!  The chicken was lovely - it tasted of old-fashioned, honest chicken - like chickens really used to taste.  The YFG said it tasted, \"really chickeny\", and it was even better cold.  We are really pleased at how it turned out.  There was enough for four roast dinners, and some left over for sandwiches or picking at, as the case may be.    Yesterday was a hectic day as I got an urgent phone call to go to show some books to a group of teachers with only an hour or so's notice, so I had to abandon the day's plans and hare off to that.  It ran on, and I ended up going straight to gymnastics from there, having no lunch and having to grab a packet of crisps and an apple to keep me going until I got home at 8.30pm.  The book meeting went well, but gymnastics got a bit hairy as all of a sudden, there were 29 girls in the first class, where there had been about 21 the last time I was there - I missed last Tuesday due to illness.  29 kids, 2 coaches, a choreographer and a parent helper - we could have done with more help!  And about 7 of the kids were relatively new, so we were trying to get their names straight, and explain stuff to them, which is important but takes time, so the whole class passed in a bit of a blur, and I was glad to get to the second where there were only 13 girls, and only one of them \"new\".    Today I have had a bike ride to take the YFG to school, picked some runner beans and prepped them for the freezer (I love the smell of fresh runner beans) and the FH has been out with his friend to bring more horse manure home to put in the raised beds to improve the soil over the winter ready for the spring planting.  I am also taking advantage of the breezy weather to do my washing and try to get it all dry."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday 22 September 2008", "text": "Early posting tonight whilst the folks are out. The FH has taken the FGs to band practice tonight, telling them that he is going to sign up to learn the trombone - it will have to be seen to be believed, but I wouldn't be surprised at anything!! The YFG and I cycled to school this morning and then I went back to pick her up at 3 so I have done four miles today, two of them into a head wind, so I should sleep well tonight.I am cooking the tea whilst they are gone, and I do hope that it is a good meal - it is the first cockerel. We are slightly disappointed with the size of him as once he was \"oven-ready\" he only weighed about three and a half pounds. That made us decide to grow the rest of the flock on longer - we'll try another one in about three weeks' time and see whether they are heavier, perhaps. We might also reduce the size of the run that they have as they are perhaps exercising too much - although I don't want to make it too small as to be cruel. I am not sure about that - I would rather try to give them more in the way of kitchen scraps and food to fatten them up a bit!I have had a sort-out in my book stock room this afternoon so that I have tidied the books up and put them all back on the shelves. This makes it a lot easier to see what I have and what I need to order. I had a small order from the school this morning, which cheered me up no end. On the other hand, the pet bantam seems to have spent the night in the room by accident, and I have had to remove several of her deposits from the carpet. That wasn't so good! She seems to get everywhere, but she is so tame that she follows the FH around the garden and is very much loved.Dilemmas - I have been asked to help with a once-a-week afterschool club at the church. I have never actually been to this club before as the FGs haven't been to it, and I don't really understand at this point what would be expected of me. Trouble is, I have a hard time saying no to anything people ask me to do. BUT it is going to eat into the only day we don't have an after-school activity: Monday is band, Tuesday is gymnastics, Wednesday the EFG is doing a fitness course for 8 weeks, Thursday is free but would be this activity, Friday is gymnastics. We then have gymnastics again Saturday mornings and church of course on Sunday mornings. The FH could do the Monday and Wednesday taxi-duties, as that is really all they are, which would help. I could cook that night's dinner in the slow-cooker, so that wouldn't be a huge problem: I am talking myself into this! I guess that just now I need to ask more questions about it and make it clear that I can be a helper but not a leader as I don't have time to do much preparation for anything in advance.I had better go and check on the chicken!"},
{"title": "A Special Sunday", "date": "Sunday 21 September 2008", "text": "It has been a long day in the sense that we seem to have done a lot! The FGs and I were at church bright and early, then we had to go on a quick shopping trip. It was the kind of trip that I hate to make - one caused by my own lack of organisation and foresight - we were having roast lamb for lunch and had no mint sauce and lamb without mint sauce is unthinkable, so I had to go to the local shops and get some, along with some other bits and bobs! Another reason not to do that kind of shopping. We live and learn. My uncle came to share lunch with us and celebrate his recent birthday, which was lovely. During the afternoon, I made him a cake and we had that at teatime.This is a picture of the YFG and her friend who came back again today. They had a great afternoon, painting their faces, playing on Nintendos, on the trampoline and in this fab den that they made adjoining a rabbit run! You can just see that they are in there, comfortably set up with rugs, blankets and their sandwiches. The rabbit out there with them is the mother of these two:It is hard to see the colours in this picture, but one is black/white and the other is grey/white. They are SO cute. They are the two that are remaining from the litter of four she had recently. They appear to be well and healthy, and are now eating solid food and drinking from the water bottle. We put the mother out on the grass so she could have a break from them and also so that she could have the opportunity to eat some grass.Tess of the D'Urbevilles has just finished on the TV - the second part of four and I am now wondering if I can find a copy of the book and catch up before next week. I did read some Thomas Hardy at school but not this, and it is addictive - I need to know what is going to happen. The costumes and settings in the series are fantastic - but I can't comment on the closeness of the filming to the original book until I have read it. We are now getting ready to prepare the first two cockerels for the table - we have been advised that it is best if they have their last food about 12 hours before they are killed, so the two that we have chosen have been separated from the flock, so that they didn't eat the second feeding today.  I am confident that they have had the best life that we could give them, which has been miles better than that of the intensively reared \"2 for £6\" kind of chicken found in the supermarkets.  We are hoping that they taste good and are keen to know how much they weigh once they are at the \"oven-ready\" stage, so that we can compare what they have cost us with how much a similar bird from a shop would have cost if we had chosen to buy one reared in a \"happy\" environment.  We'll let you know later."},
{"title": "Eggs-traordinary!", "date": "Saturday 20 September 2008", "text": "This is the enormous egg that one of my hens laid yesterday, pictured above next to a more normal sized egg from one of her companions.  I was going to say that I could not imagine laying that, but having had two children, I am afraid I can!!!  I scrambled it for the EFG's breakfast this morning, and it had two yolks inside.  The shell was quite thin, so I am thinking that this probably indicates that this particular hen is coming to the end of her laying life, but since I don't know which hen that is, she'll continue to be part of the flock for now.The new chicks and the quail are all eating well and seem to have settled in.  The FH is going to create a proper pen for the quail later but for now they are doing fine scurrying around in an oversized rabbit hutch.  They do jump up as if trying to take flight, but they don't seem to hurt their heads too much on the wire, thank goodness!  After gymnastics today, I continued the energetic theme to the day by digging over one of my vegetable beds.  The FH keeps reminding me that he wants to plant over-wintering broad beans, but that is pretty much all he mutters - I knew that what he was really saying was that I should prepare the ground so that he could plant them!  So, the ground is now ready, and hopefully he will get them planted soon whilst the soil is warm from the sunshine we are enjoying this weekend.  The YFG took great pleasure from cutting the back lawn for me, closely supervised.  I will have to do the front again soon.  The YFG had a friend round to play for a couple of hours this evening, and once again, I had to stretch a meal for four to feed five, but it worked OK, and no one went hungry.  Ironing beckons yet again, so that is it for today."},
{"title": "Quick post tonight", "date": "Friday 19 September 2008", "text": "I am SO tired that I have to head for bed very soon!  Busy morning with various things to do, hanging washing, caring for all the various birds now in residence, tidying up and a bit more baking!  Had a break after a late lunch then off to pick up the YFG from school and head to the gym to get the equipment out and set up for the first class.  Two and a half classes and a trip to the supermarket later, we were coming home for our supper.  Watched Wire in the Blood as it was the second of a two parter, and now I am fading fast!  Have got a super picture of some eggs to show you tomorrow but no energy to sort it out tonight...."},
{"title": "New residents!", "date": "Thursday 18 September 2008", "text": "These are the next batch of Sasso chicks - there are 22 of them and they hatched early this morning, we are told! I don't know why we didn't get the ones that hatched on Sunday, as we had been told we were getting.  However, they are gorgeous and we hope that they grow up to be as big as the ones we have already - who are now at the other end of their lifespan. I think that it has been good for the girls to see how these chicks live, grow and then have a useful ending. They have had a good life and been well loved!These are the other newcomers today - 11 Japanese/coturnix quail. They have come from a breeder out in Norfolk, and we are not sure (apparently, neither was he!) how many males and females we have here; I ordered 10 point of lay hens, but he has sent 11, and told the FH that the extra one was because he thought that one might have been a cock bird. The FH forgot to ask exactly how old they are, so we are not sure when they may start to lay, so we'll just see how they get on!So, the FH had a day out with his mate from round the corner, visiting the breeder and the hatchery to pick these up for me. He also had to get some chick crumbs, and deliver an order of books into the centre of Cambridge for me to one of the schools which regularly buys my books for their library. Coincidentally, the FH knows their Bursar from years ago so he called in for a quick chat with him too. What with going north into Norfolk and then into Cambridge, he certainly clocked up the miles today, but it was more efficient to do that than to do a lot of separate journeys. He stopped near an airfield and they ate their sandwiches whilst watching the planes come and go.I have had a good day today - the YFG and I cycled her to school so I did two miles this morning for my exercise, several loads of washing went out on the line, the YFG's bed was changed as she was ready for the winter flannelette sheets to be put on, I made 5 dozen biscuits, cooked a new recipe for tea which went down well, tidied up the dining room a bit, and had a rest too! Recipes to follow:Bacon potato pie - this is a concoction of mine!I took some instant potato and made up about 2 portions, and used that to line a shallow Pyrex pie dish. I fried 2 chopped onions in a little oil and then put the onion in to the potato casing. Then I grated a little cheese (and it was a Little! about 3 oz) over the onion. I grilled 2 rashers of bacon and cut them up and put them over the cheese, whisked up four eggs and poured them over the lot and put it in the oven for about half an hour. The smell coming from the oven was glorious, the top went golden and crispy and everyone wanted seconds! I served this with carrots and steamed broccoli.The biscuit recipe comes from a friend called Jane. She calls them \"Oaten Biscuits\".You need 4 oz self-raising flour, 4 oz margerine, 3 oz sugar, 2 oz oats, 1 teaspoon golden syrup, 3 tsp boiling water, and a splash of vanilla essence. These amounts make about 16, but I quadrupled it and made 60. They freeze well in bags of a dozen and come out to thaw overnight before going into lunchboxes. I add a packet of chocolate chips to the recipe to make chocolate cookies - I don't add four when I scale up the recipe! Two bags is enough.So, the method I use is to put all the dry ingredients into a bowl, with the choc chips, and then melt the margerine in a pan on the stove. I add the syrup, vanilla essence and the water to the pan and warm it all through. Then I mix the melted stuff into the dry ingredients. Sure, the choc chips melt somewhat, but that doesn't matter. Then I take spoonfuls of the mixture and put well-spaced on baking trays and cook for 10 minutes at about 170C. Ten minutes is enough, but they will be soggy when you bring them out - you need to put them on cooling racks until they are cold and then you will find that they have crisped up nicely. Lift them over carefully with a fish slice. Rhonda has some excellent links for home-made Christmas gifts that I have been looking at today.  I do have a stash of material so I think I will be going through it soon to see if there is anything that I can use to make a few gifts.  I would also like to make myself a few new aprons, so I need to use a favourite apron to make a pattern.  I will also have to get out the sewing machine and see if I can make it work...Heading off to finish tidying the kitchen, fold the dry laundry and then take a bath."},
{"title": "A slow but steady day", "date": "Wednesday 17 September 2008", "text": "I am still feeling the effects of being ill yesterday so what I did today was done slowly and with rest periods in between.   I was up early, and got the FGs off to school, and then did my household stuff steadily, things like making beds, tidying, hoovering and polishing,etc.  I had to go to take the YFG to see our doctor late in the morning as she has been having a lot of headaches; the doctor thinks that it might be something to do with the glare off the interactive whiteboard that is used in her classroom.  Since the YFG sits near to the white board, it is quite bright for her, so we had a chat with her teacher and he will be moving her to the back of the room tomorrow - good result.  Hopefully this will help the headaches, but also keeping her well hydrated and rested is also important, so she is having some early nights. I had thought that I would cut the back lawn today but thinking about it was enough, and I haven't done it yet.  I admit to sitting and watching the news for quite some time today as we are interested in the HBOS problems - we used to have a mortgage with the Halifax when it was just the Halifax, and we have a small number of shares that we were given when it converted to a bank.  The share price dipped so low today that I thought that they were going to lose all their value - it went as low as 88p at one time, and then the announcement of take-over talks with Lloyds TSB meant that the shares bounced a little bit higher and recovered most of the day's losses.  I am glad that we no longer have a mortgage, but these problems are affecting us all in one way or another.When the EYG came home from school, we were straight out the door again as she was going to the local sports centre to try out a gym course.  This is not gymnastics but using fitness equipment to get fitter, and have fun along the way.  It is a special pregramme for 11-13 year olds, and today was a free taster session - but she liked it so we signed up for the full eight week course, which begins October 8th. On the way home, I did a bit of weightlifting as a friend had gifted me two huge sacks of wheat for my chickens and I had to call round and pick them up - and they were Heavy!  It was very generous of him to give us them, and will have saved me well over £20 off next month's feed bill.Tomorrow the FH is going to pick up the next batch of chicks - we have ordered them today and there are some ready to leave the hatchery already!  They hatched out on Sunday so they are already a few days old - I will be taking LOTS of photos this time so that we can all see them grow.  The existing flock are now being fed only wheat in preparation for killing at the weekend.  Well, some of them will be killed, we'll have to see how we go with the room in the freezer!I am keenly watching Rhonda's blog to see what ideas she has for home made Christmas gifts but I am hoping that they don't all involve sewing or knitting as I am sure that I couldn't produce anything gift-able made in either of those media.  Cooked gifts I can do, but not those!  You can check out her blog at http://down---to---earth.blogspot.com - it is great, and I am learning so much from reading it. Well, that is it for today.  I know I have one reader, so I am sending love to Ohio, and goodnight!"},
{"title": "Busy and then not so busy!", "date": "Tuesday 16 September 2008", "text": "The day got off to a great start - the FGs went off to school and I set to on the household chores and looking after the chickens. I had bought some mince to make into meals for the freezer and cooked that up in two big batches, finished all the ironing and even put it away, talked to a local shopkeeper about a stall at the coffee morning, organised a couple of posters being put up and an announcement at the Women's Section of the Royal British Legion in the village as publicity, and then I walked all round the little estate where I live and put flyers through the doors so that people know - the more people who come, hopefully the more we will raise for Macmillan. And that was that - I then got ill with an upset stomach and felt really cold and tired, so I went to bed for a couple of hours. The FH had to take the YFG to gymnastics tonight, and the EFG pampered me with a cup of tea, and then brought me downstairs and tucked me up under a duvet to watch \"The Full Monty\" on video. I am feeling OK now, but I am hoping for an early night!"},
{"title": "Meetings and musings", "date": "Monday 15 September 2008", "text": "Well, I spent the whole morning at a school meeting and came home exhausted from having to use my brain quite so much!  There were only four of us at the meeting and so a significant amount of brain power was required but we did achieve a successful outcome!  Instead of doing anything too active this afternoon, I ate my lunch (I was starving as I stupidly forgot to eat any breakfast!) and then worked on some flyers for the school children to take home about the coffee morning next Friday.  I crossed my fingers that the my printer had enough ink left in it to do 110 copies, and left it to churn them out whilst I went to the local shop to ask if they would like to donate some tea bags or coffee.  The lady in the shop kindly gave me a big box of tea bags, but I was given the coffee as well by a neighbour.  God says \"Ask, and you will receive,\" but I am not sure miracles extend to cakes to go with the coffee - let's just hope He gives me the energy to do some baking on Thursday and blesses the event with a lot of people coming along and spending money so that the charity does well out of it.  I'd be satisfied with that.Satisfied.  That is a good word.  I have been reading a Bible study about it today, and it seems that NOT being satisfied is a big problem in this world in which we live.  There are too many people whose physical hunger and thirst is not satisfied because of circumstances beyond their control such as drought, famine and disasters such as civil wars - these things especially are happening in Africa.  Unfortunately there is a \"satisfaction\" problem in the developed world as we who have so much want more, and therein lies the root of the problems of debt, and divorce, to name just two examples.  I knew a very wise woman in Scotland years ago who struggled with five children, a very small house, and a husband who was of a philanthropic turn of mind who didn't really earn enough to support his family, let alone be generous towards others.  She asked God to make her content with where she was in her life, and thanked Him for his gifts to her; she always had an air of serenity that was surprising in a woman with so many challenges in her life.  She was grateful for anything that anyone did for her - the FH acquired a small length of kitchen work surface for her from a mutual friend and installed it in her kitchen where she had only had a piece of rough wood previously, and one would have thought he had given her the world, so pleased with it was she.  It did make her life easier as it gave her a more hygienic place to knead her bread, and prepare food. I once heard of a style of interior decorating called \"Early Marriage\".  I doubt that it will ever catch on as being very fashionable - but it should!  It involves accepting anything that you are given and making use of it, buying things secondhand and being creative.  It is probably supposed to only go on until the couple get themselves established, but some of us have gone on with it longer than others!!  My children laughed when I told them that our first TV stand was a cardboard box turned upside down and covered in a cloth!  It did the job, though!  I think that most of us, myself included, would be better for being more content or satisfied with what we have and who we are now, rather than striving to be someone else, or to acquire material goods.  There is no way that we are going to take it all with us when we die, so there is little to be gained by being miserable in the pursuit of riches, especially if it means that our lives are less than they could be.  We live on what, for this country, is a relatively low income, but whilst I would love cash available for upgraded cars, holidays abroad, seasonal new clothes, it is more important to me that we have a thankful heart for what we do have - a loving family, a comfortable house to live in, a safe neighbourhood, friends, enough food to eat, and time to share in the community.  I have a degree and could probably get a job that would allow us to have more material things, but I worry that we would lose some of the other things - would I have time to spend with the FGs and FH, would I be able to continue with the voluntary work that I enjoy, would we have to move house?   We are a long way from being perfect in this, and I have two girls who constantly aspire to have things that their friends have, and the FH and I talk about things that we would like to do or have, so we have to work on this more ourselves.  I hope that this has made you think about being satisfied a little the way the book made me think this afternoon."},
{"title": "Decisions, decisions!", "date": "Sunday 14 September 2008", "text": "I phoned a Helpline to ask questions about the HPV vaccine on Friday, and I didn't really get any answers.  All I got was the feeling that someone is getting paid handsomely somewhere to convince more people to have the jab, and I am not so easily convinced. The EFG has had an illness when she was about 5, going on 6, called Henoch-Schonlein Purpura.  It is a kind of vasculitis where blotches appear on the arms and legs, which, when pressed with a glass, do not go away.  This is a serious illness, and she saw a consultant at our local hospital about it.  Kidneys are also affected, and all sorts of other weird symptoms which are hard to explain to a 5/6 year old - her ankle swelled up, she had a lot of stomach ache, she was tired a lot and we had to keep getting her urine checked - for weeks afterwards.  The other distressing thing for her was that just when one lot of the blotches had faded, a new batch would appear.  Now, we do not know categorically what caused HSP in the EFG but she had had an amalgam filling shortly before, and there are some studies which link the two - although I admit that there are plenty which don't.  The point is that we just don't know, and since we understand that if it happens again, it may affect her in a more serious way, we obviously want to avoid that.  SO, I asked about contra-indications and whether this vaccine was OK to give to children who have had HSP, and they really didn't know.  I was advised to go and look on the internet!!!!!!!  The only slightly useful thing that I was told was that in children who have had an auto-immune disease, the vaccine may not provide as good protection as it does in other children. That leaves me with weighing up the situation for myself - do I allow her to have the vaccine, knowing that the protection it gives may not be worth the risk, and there are other risks as well as those posed by HSP.  Or do I not allow the vaccine, and pray hard that she never succumbs to the 2 kinds of cervical cancer from which it might have protected her (bearing in mind that there are a lot more than 2 kinds, and she may still fall prey to one of the others even if she had the vaccine)?  I asked about getting the vaccine later, as I also think that it is not necessary to give the EFG the vaccine right now, but apparently GPs are not going to be able to give this vaccine, and should we want to buy it privately, it will cost upwards of £400.  The person I spoke to seemed to think that 6 years' of work on this vaccine was enough, and it is safe and we should just toe the line and do it.  If you know me, you know I am not like that!  I always ask questions, and even then, we often don't \"do\" whatever it is that we are supposed to do.  I am definitely not a herd animal.  We didn't do MMR and I don't think that we will do this.......but I am not sure....Aprt from that, we had another birthday celebration at church this morning, for a seven-year old, to whom we gave the \"bumps\" - she just squealed with delight and said, \"Again!!\".  The FH has taken the FGs out for the afternoon, visiting relatives and a local show.  They'll be back in time for tea.  I have had an hour watching a DVD of a favourite TV show from a few years ago, and now I am going to continue to tidy my room - there are clothes all over the bed so the FH will complain if he can't get in there tonight.  I am having a bit of a clear out as well so there are a few bin bags up there - one for the rubbish and one for the donations for the charity shop.I have finished the week in skirts, and even rode my bicycle to church this morning wearing one, although the EFG warned me at one stage that it looked as if it was going to get caught in the wheel.  It is a beautiful day here again and the washing is blowing on the line so there will be freshly-smelling laundry to iron tonight - I love the smell of line-dried laundry!"},
{"title": "Friday whizzed past!", "date": "Saturday 13 September 2008", "text": "And here we are on Saturday already.  Yesterday was a very worrying day as the YFG had a big wobble about going to school after her sick day and I am still not 100% sure if that is OK now.  She came home for lunch and then returned to school in the afternoon, and when I got home from gymnastics last night, she was happily doing her homework. The other concerning thing was my dad being sent into hospital by his GP as his ECG results had shown that his heart was racing far too fast.  I spent a few hours worrying about him, and hoping that the hospital would be able to resolve the problem.  Again, I spoke to him last night when he rang to say that the hospital had let him out and he has to take Warfarin to thin his blood now.  But he is OK.I had some rushing around to do yesterday morning as my usual feed merchant had no growers pellets in stock for the young chickens, and unfortunately, he wouldn't have any in until next Thursday - they would have been starving by then!  So I had to find another local supplier, and since her shop is on the same route as the supermarket, I went there as well, which made the car rather heavily laden by the time I got home.  All the shopping got put away eventually.The food prices were worth noting at the supermarket yesterday - I was shocked to see that a 3kg bag of conchigle pasta that I usually buy had gone up from £2.97 to £3.97!  Strangely though, the fusili and penne in the 3kg bags were still £2.97 so I got one of each of those.  That will keep us going for some months.  Another price change I noticed (and this is something we all use, I think!) was the loo roll - the own brand pack of 12 which had been about £4.69 had leapt to over £5.  That is a lot to pay for stuff that gets flushed, so I found Andrex 4 roll packs at £1.50 on offer and bought three of those instead, saving at least 50p.  Small savings, yes, but they all add up, and making small savings often can save more in the long run than making big savings less often , if you see what I mean!    Prices are definitely on the up, but I think that there are still bargains to be had if you know your prices, and make some changes to your expectations - I chose chicken pieces yesterday over a whole chicken as the supermarket had only got expensive, large chickens in stock and FH wanted roast chicken tomorrow.  He's still going to get the taste of roasted chicken, but it will be in portions instead of whole.Off to gymnastics again this morning so I had better get going!"},
{"title": "A sick day", "date": "Thursday 11 September 2008", "text": "for one of the FGs - the YFG has had a swollen throat today and stayed at home, snuggled under a duvet for most of the day.  She watched some TV, played games on the internet and read some books and generally had a rest, so I think that she will be fit to go to school tomorrow although probably not to gymnastics tomorrow afternoon.  She can take a break from that and go on Saturday. I have made bread as usual today, spoken to my dad about his health (he has to have an ECG tomorrow), taken delivery of lots of books, and generally looked after the YFG.  I have sent some \"fishing\" emails for work, and organised a venue and a couple of stalls for the Macmillan coffee morning at the end of the month, so that is a start!Hopefully, I will get more done tomorrow, but it has been nice to have a slow day for a change, and do things at a more restful pace! I have also taken time to look through lots of the new books that I have for selling. This week I am having an experimental \"skirt week\" wearing skirts every day.  I usually wear trousers nearly all the time, but I am beginning to feel that I should wear skirts more often.  There are passages in the Bible that indicate that women should not wear men's clothing and that we should be different.  I feel smarter and more feminine in skirts and I have to say that I have done all the things that I usually do, just wearing a skirt - gardening, cleaning rabbit hutches out, wading through the mud in the chicken run in my wellies, carrying wood around the yard, all wearing a skirt.  It hasn't caused any problems, and I have felt that when I have needed to pop out to pick up the YFG from school or nip to the Post Office, I have been smarter than running up there in yoga pants from Mackays and plastic clogs - I am beginning to actively feel scruffy when dressed like that.  Do people treat me differently wearing a skirt?  Not sure that I have noticed that yet, so will have to persevere and see how it goes.  I think that I will continue, but in the winter, if I get that far, I am going to have to find some much thicker skirts, probably in the charity shops, or some kind of leggings to wear under the skirts for warmth.  I do wear very long skirts so no one would know!  I have to wear a tracksuit for gym and I will continue to do that for the sake of practicality, but that is about the only time when I have to wear trousers."},

I hadn't heard about it last night, but got up to speed this morning by watching Breakfast on BBC. Obviously, the world hasn't ended if you are still reading this, and I did reassure them this morning that the experiment would not have been allowed if there was a big risk (well, I hope not anyway!!)The EFG came home yesterday from school with a form to be completed for her to receive the new cervical cancer vaccine - or the vaccine for HPV which should reduce the risk of cervical cancer. I have some reservations about her having this right now - she is only 12, and I do not think it is necessary to give it so young, and perhaps there has not been enough research into the safety of the vaccine yet. She seems to want to have it done, so I must look into it a little more. I am puzzled by the leaflet which says that the decision is legally hers.......really? Why do I have to sign consent forms for her medical treatment, then? We'll see. I'll let you know what we decide, as the injections aren't due to be given at the school until the 8th October so we have a little time.The YFG is going to play with her friend after school so I have been released from the rigours of the school run this afternoon - although I have the EFG going to a group tonight in the village, and a school meeting tonight so small mercies, eh?The chickens are happy, the veg are growing, the greenhouse has plants in residence, in short. BUT two of the baby rabbit have died, so there are just two remaining, but they are looking healthy and rounded. This is not a shock for us, as unfortunately Rosie does not have a good history of having a second litter in a year. Perhaps we should bear that in mind and not let her have a second litter next year. However, if these two live, and I think that they will, it will be a better outcome than last year, when all but one died and we had to hand rear him. Also on the rabbit news was the discovery of a wild brown rabbit in the garden this morning. The EFG was excited at seeing it when she was feeding the others, and came in to tell us how enchanting it looked, but the FH and I were not so happy as we are concerned about the transfer of disease to our domestic pets. We have had a good look at the fences but can't find where it got in."},
{"title": "No rain today - hurray!", "date": "Monday 8 September 2008", "text": "Yes - a whole day with no rain!  I was so pleased.  Managed to get the grass cut out the front of the house so that looks a bit tidier, to keep the neighbours happy, and me, I suppose.  The inside of the house may be lacking in that department, but it is relatively easy to cut the grass once a week - at least no one leaves clutter all over it.  The YFG did some tidying yesterday, including my desk and then put up a big notice saying \"Do not mess up!\" so I have to be on my best behaviour.  She did a good job, though.Today has been a good day in many ways - I got a lot of Usborne work done, made some bread, spoke to a few people I needed to catch up with, arranged with a friend to organise a coffee morning for Macmillan at the end of the month if we can find a venue, arranged a play-date for YFG with her friend from school, etc.  We also did our good deed for the day at school - there is an after school dance club that YFG was going to do to keep her friend company, except that she got a place and her friend didn't, so she realised that it wouldn't be as much fun if her friend wasn't there and didn't want to go.  Another little girl from her class was in tears in the playground because she didn't get a place, so we marched into the office and asked that this little girl have YFG's place as we didn't want it any more - so that little one and her mum were pleased.I have got the headstone arranged for Mum today - I rang the stonemason and spoke with them about the queries we had, and the lady I spoke to was very helpful, so I had to check with my Dad that he agreed with what we had done, filled the order form in and got it into the post this afternoon, along with the claim for the glass from the greenhouse people.The FGs went to band practice tonight, I nipped into the supermarket and then we all came home to tea which the FH had prepared.  Now I just have some ironing to do when the FGs are in bed, which should be very soon!"},
{"title": "Sunday again....", "date": "Sunday 7 September 2008", "text": "the time is flying past!  Church at 9.30 this morning, with a birthday cake as one of the girls was turning 13 today, so it was lovely to share the celebration with the church family and the FGs and I were pleased to be included.  We all sang Happy Birthday and since the EFG knows the girl from school, we took a card along for her too.Home to the garden and bean and tomato harvesting in between some very heavy showers.  The FH went out for a couple of hours to see a friend, so I gave the FGs some tuna sandwiches and banana cake for their lunch and postponed the hot meal until later.  Spent half an hour on the phone with another friend of mine, and then had a quick chat with my dad - he had been for a walk to fetch a paper this morning and got absolutely drenched to the skin and was feeling a little the worse for wear, poor chap.  My sister popped in for a cup of tea and a chat as we are organising a headstone for my mum's grave and needed to decide on an inscription and choose a stone.  These things take time and we eventually sorted that out so I have to ring the stonemason tomorrow to ask a couple of questions, and then have him send my dad the bill!  The FGs went out riding their bikes for some time, and then went on the trampoline.  Unfortunately, the trampoline was very wet from all the showers, so they ended up soaked and decided to have an early bath and put on their PJs, which was fine as it saved me chasing them into the bath tonight.  They have been watching TV, playing games and bickering for most of the evening!After eating, the YFG wanted to be my assistant whilst I did some baking, and we made several things - brownies, and two kinds of oat biscuits.  Two recipes that I use frequently came from the excellent ladies (and gentlemen!) on the Forums at www.moneysavingexpert.com - I use the Weetabix brownie recipe, and Twink's Hobnobs.  Well worth a look, so head over there and scout around the Old Style board.  We also rang a friend to ask for her recipe for choc chip cookies, which we then made.  So the cake and biscuit tins are replenished for the week ahead and the lunchbox dilemmas solved for a few days - and the Twink's Hobnobs are in the freezer so that they last until the end of the week or else the gannets that live here would have eaten the lot by Wednesday.  I did manage to grab a photo before they started on them!Don't they look delicious?!  You have to watch them very carefully in the oven as you want them the right side of golden brown, and not too dark.  We had planned to do a little more baking as the YFG wanted to make some muffins but I ran out of sugar, so that will have to be postponed, although I may make some cheese scones tomorrow."},
{"title": "Glass, gym and straw", "date": "Saturday 6 September 2008", "text": "were the highlights of my day!  I picked up horticultural glass from the glazier for the greenhouse, went to gymnastics for three and a half hours, fetched straw and then went home, chucked a bale of straw into the chicken run and had a quick shower before my friend came round to cut my hair at 3pm.  I was very glad to sit and let her do her thing for half an hour and just catch up with myself!I am very pleased with the haircuts that R did for YFG and myself - YFG's hair is very fine and the way that R has cut it means that it is beginning to look a bit thicker and the ends have been tidied up brilliantly so that it no longer looks straggly.  Mine is short and I love it!The grower chickens were in a sea of mud after all the rain that we have had this week, and covering their run in a layer of straw was about the only thing that would remedy the situation - they thought it was great this afternoon and spent hours scratching happily!  I gave the laying hens some as well as they looked as if they were jealous of the growers having all the fun.  They are laying well at the moment, although our favourite, called \"Goldenburg\" (don't ask why cos I don't know!) seems to think that she would like to have another brood of chicks as she is sitting on the nest and has been for days!  It is too late in the season now, so she will have to be persuaded to get back to normal - she must have enjoyed life in the maternity wing!"},
{"title": "It is STILL raining...", "date": "Friday 5 September 2008", "text": "and if we were still home-educating the FGs, we would be doing a monsoon/weather project by now.  We had been hoping for a bit of sunshine when the FGs went back to school, but this is a disappointment.  The garden needs rain, but not this much!  I have beans out there needing to get picked and I don't want to get soaked doing it, so haven't harvested them yet - I am praying that the sun promised for Monday actually materialises!YFG and I are getting our hair cut tomorrow by a friend so YFG has been trying to decide how she wants hers done.  Mine is less of a problem - it is going short!  I have a cycle where I grow it quite long, beyond my shoulders, and then I have it dramatically all cut off into a very short style.  Some hairdressers are apprehensive of cutting so much off at once, but this will be about the fourth or fifth time I have done it, and it is no problem to me - I enjoy the change.  It takes about 2 years to get back to the length it is now, so come 2010, I know I'll have long hair again.Busy day again tomorrow so I am off for an early night."},
{"title": "Rain, rain and more rain!", "date": "Thursday 4 September 2008", "text": "We have had so much rain in the last few days!  Driving home from gym on Tuesday evening, the YFG and I were caught in a thunderstorm, and it was scary - the lightening was just ferocious, lighting up the whole sky, and the rain was coming down so hard that I had to creep along the road as it was so difficult to see where I was going - the windscreen wipers just couldn't keep up with the amount of rain falling. The YFG was quite scared.  We got home safely, thank goodness. It is raining again today, although less dramatically.  Unfortunately, that has put a stop to the harvesting of the veg for now, so I have to concentrate on inside jobs today.  The 8.30 meeting this morning was very successful, and the books are now chosen, ready at the school and someone has the job of putting bookplates in them before they are given to the children on Monday. I tried to buy the glass to finish the greenhouse this morning but the glazier had only got one piece of horticultural glass in stock - not much good when you need four pieces - so I will have to try again at the weekend as he promised that there would be a delivery by then.  Yesterday the FH sowed some seeds in the greenhouse - lettuce, cabbage, and broccoli, so that they can grow in there over the winter and be planted outside in the spring, ready for a head-start on later-planted veg.  The freezers are getting very full, and I am getting worried about where we will freeze the chickens that will be killed in October - it would be counter-productive to have to find and run another freezer just for them! The EFG starts Spanish at school today.  She has had a year of French, and now has to add Spanish to the mix, so I hope that she doesn't get confused.  I have learned French, German, Latin, Russian, Biblical Hebrew and Ancient Greek in my time, but never Spanish, so I am not going to be much help to her with that, although I do help her out with the French occasionally.  We mums have to be helpful - she came home on the first day with science homework - find out what the name of the process is in which a solid becomes a gas (without becoming a liquid)?  She had no idea, but I got out the trusty Usborne Science Dictionary and had the answer in seconds - sublimation - so the thing to do is not necessarily know all the answers, but to know where to find them!"},
{"title": "Buns for tea, but not at three!", "date": "Wednesday 3 September 2008", "text": "Sorry that photo is a bit out of focus! The joys of the storecupboard were brought home to me again this afternoon when YFG asked if her friend could come home to play for the rest of the afternoon, and I jokingly said, \"Only if she likes turkey stew!\" as that was what I had prepped for tea. Her poor friend's face fell as she said, quite reluctantly, \"I don't like turkey!\" I had to think quickly, pat her gently on the shoulder and tell her that that was OK really as there was plenty of pizza in the freezer that I could pull out. I had made a spare one last week and so that was their tea sorted, but there was still no pudding - little girls need pudding when they have guests for tea, so I quickly whipped up a batch of buns, popped them in the oven before the pizza went in and iced them pink when they had cooled. Job done and three happy girls.I have had a good day at \"work\" today as I had a call from a school wanting to buy 90 books as gifts for their children (I am an Usborne bookseller) but the only snag is that they need them to give to the kids on Monday! Our order turnaround is fast, but not that fast, so I am going to meet with the Head at 8.30 tomorrow morning, and hopefully he will be able to choose the books for the children from a selection that I am going to take with me - he certainly won't be able to have any that would need to be ordered. I do business with this school regularly so I am pleased to be able to help them out, and it is a great start to September! I don't \"work\" as much as I used to at Usborne, and I pick and choose the work that I do with the books more carefully than I used to - I was obsessed at one time, and now I have taken a back seat and don't go looking for the work as much; I have been lucky in that enough business comes my way to keep me ticking over, but the Christmas season is approaching and I know that it will be busy!Gymnastics started up again last night and the other coaches and I had forgotten how much physical work it is for us as well as for the girls - we all felt the strain last night!Early to bed tonight as I have to travel to that 8.30 meeting tomorrow so I'll have to be up with the birds in the morning."},

I'm sure I will soon get used to it and the FH is still around, so it is not that quiet. He has just popped out to see a friend so the sound of the chickens in the garden is all the noise there is at the moment - both breadmakers are on, too, though they are both in the rising part of the cycle so no sounds there either. Will have to go and make some myself in a minute with the hoover.I took the picture of the greenhouse so that I could show the almost-finished product. I am pleased with it, and looking forward to growing things in it!Both of the FGs went off to school quite happily this morning, with no worries and no backward glances, so I count myself blessed that they are content! The EFG found it strange to put a tie back on after so long without, though. She'll soon be used to it again."},
{"title": "Playing a waiting game", "date": "Monday 1 September 2008", "text": "The FGs must have asked me the time every half hour this morning!  We got up earlier than we have been doing as a practice run for school starting back tomorrow.  That meant that all the animals jobs were done early and they were twiddling their thumbs by 10 am - wish I had been!  The ironing baskets were overflowing last night so I had some left to finish this morning, which I did whilst watching a gymnastics training DVD ready for the new term starting at gym tomorrow as well.  A Bulgarian master coach has made a really good DVD about using ballet strength and flexibility training to help gymnasts.  Some of the postures and stretches looked really painful - I am glad that I only have to teach and not demonstrate!!This afternoon, the girls' patience was rewarded and we went to a stamping studio for a couple of hours and they made Christmas cards whilst I was making a scrapbook page and a couple of cards, under expert instruction.  Jackie has a blog too and I will have to get a link in here when I get the address.An hour at the Junior Band tonight, practising their cornets, and then home to toad in the hole for tea.  There has been an air of excitement coupled with some apprehension today as both the FGs go back to school tomorrow after the holidays - the YFG into year 5 at the village primary school and the EFG into year 8 at the local community college.  The YFG has a male teacher this year, but he is a good teacher, in my opinion, and I think that she will have a good year with him.  It will be her second year at school, and she is loving it, so I really hope that this year builds on and develops the progress she made last year.  The EFG will have some new teachers and a new form tutor, so we will have to see what happens tomorrow.  All is ready tonight and we have the alarms set for an early start in the morning.The greenhouse now has a bench for potting and storing stuff on - my fuschia, Delta's Sarah, has already taken up residence and is looking better for the warmth.  I think that it will not be long before the cat sneaks in there for a snooze, too, and the FH has made sure that the path is wide enough that he can fit a deck chair in there for his 40 winks!We have been watching the news and were pleased to see that the flooding of Katrine 3 years ago has so far not been repeated in New Orleans.  The hurricane has also been downgraded to a category 2, so we are praying that there will be less losses this time, although it was disturbing to hear that there are a few other hurricanes developing in that part of the world.  We will be continuing to pray for their safety."},
{"title": "Peace on a Sunday", "date": "Sunday 31 August 2008", "text": "A hectic time this morning, as mornings often are, but we made it to church by 9.30am and were in our seats with tea and muffins before the preacher stood up to start!  She was very intuitive, realising that once we were quiet, she could begin - good that it is a very informal church....we get a different preacher each week, and they are not all so switched-on!  It was lovely to be told that we had been missed last week when I wasn't feeling well so we had stayed at home.Relatives came over for lunch and this was a good example of conjuring something out of nothing!  I had planned to serve a roast dinner, but on going to the freezer last night, I discovered that there was nothing in there to roast - whoops!  That meant a change of plan - so we ended up enjoying smoked salmon on a bed of lettuce and tomatoes from the garden, followed by sausage plait with potatoes, carrots, beans and courgettes, then apple crumble and custard to finish.  And it all came out of the garden, the freezer or the storecupboard, without me having to make a special trip to the shops for anything.  That is not forward planning (as that had failed on this occasion), but just keeping a good pantry!  Everyone went home replete.  It was a lovely afternoon to sit and chat in the garden as we had none of the heavy rain and thunderstorms that we had thought we might get here.  I even baked a couple of lemon cakes this afternoon so we had one cut for afternoon tea time and my uncle took the other one home with him in exchange for the plums, beans, beetroot and apples he brought for us - I think we got the better deal so I should plan to make him something else before too long.We have been thinking about the people of the Gulf Coast area of America and hoping that Hurricane Gustav does not affect them as badly as Katrine did in the past.  The images of the complete devastation that Katrine left behind as she passed over will always be remembered, and I am sure that having that in their past has galvanised the people into action this time - I heard that they are aiming for 100% evacuation this time - I hope that they achieve it and that no lives are lost.  We are praying for all the families that it is affecting.Greenhouse update - the work is done as far as it can be at the moment as some pieces of glass are actually missing, and a couple were broken when the packages were unwrapped so we have a little hole to be finished off when we can get some more glass.  It is looking good, though!I am off to tackle a heap of ironing now and watch some TV at the same time."},

Lots of washing blowing on the line and the FGs outside playing with the neighbourhood children on their bikes.The harvest this morning was particularly good - courgettes, tomatoes and a marrow that is really an overgrown courgette!And just look where the pet bantam laid her egg yesterday - could you imagine a more uncomfortable place??!!She is a very dainty little lady - here she is:So, we have also planted some cauliflower plants FH was given, and he has been continuing his mission to erect the greenhouse.  The aluminium frame was put onto the concrete base this morning, and he has spent most of the day, the air blue with his frustration, trying to put a narrow strip of rubber around the bars ready for the glazing panels to go in.  The rubber was eventually in place, and he is now putting the glass in, although two pieces were broken when he opened the packets so it won't be finished tonight. The FGs are enjoying a game of rounders with some other children, and will soon have to give in for the night as the darkness will overcome them!"},
{"title": "Triumph and disaster", "date": "Friday 29 August 2008", "text": "I have been meaning to share this photo for a couple of days and keep forgetting!  This is a rather large spider who has been living under our verandah for about a week.  She has a large web, her pantry, where she has been catching flies.  I managed to catch a quick snap of her as she came out for her supper the other evening. The disaster (let's get the bad news over first!) was that the YFG got two fingers caught in the car door this afternoon, absolutely screamed with the pain and had to be taken to the local cottage hospital for an x-ray.  The two fingers in question are badly bruised, but thankfully not broken.  The swelling will hopefully go down over the next day or so, and she is resting it in a sling.The triumph was the whole family working together this evening to get the concrete base laid for the new greenhouse.  It was jolly hard work but it is done!  What with the dash to the hospital and the concrete mixing, dinner tonight was basic - FH and EFG had beans with bread rolls as we have run out of bread to make toast, the YFG had noodles and I had leftovers.  Easy peasy and very quick!  The even better thing was the EFG prepared it whilst I was shovelling concrete.I am going to start making bread again - I have got out of the habit as the FGs had been wanting white bread to make toast, so I have been buying that, as my home-made bread is rather chunky for that.  They will have to adapt, I think, to mine again!  The bread machine is going to be set tonight so that there will be fresh bread for breakfast."},
{"title": "School shoes and shopping!", "date": "Thursday 28 August 2008", "text": "The trial began in Clarks - and ended in the Factory Shop. The YFG went first in the shoe shop and had no choice over her new school shoes, poor child. Their selection is not vast when you are a 2H, and so she had to have the solitary pair which fitted. She was not terribly happy, but the EFG had it worse - the machine brought up 4 and a half H as her size, so she had to try on loads of shoes but resigned herself to a smart pair of lace-ups which are not her taste, but should be supportive and comfortable when she is walking around school all day in them. Anyhow, we survived and moved on to the Factory Shop to get a pair of cheap trainers for PE for the YFG. Cheap it had to be when I had just spent £66 in Clarks - and the trainers are worn once a week for an hour, so they don't warrant a fortune. The EFG was pleased to find a £2 pair of red canvas shoes so I bought her those for wearing at home, and for casual sport. She is planning to wear them tomorrow for the day of sport that they will be attending.I have been very pleased with the dwarf beans that I planted in the early summer - they are cropping heavily and this morning, I was able to pick a huge pan of them again. They are a fine bean, of the type often called \"Kenyan\" in the seed catalogues, so I am definitely going to be growing these again. Two neighbours got donations of these this afternoon, so I hope they enjoyed them as well.This evening, YFG has a friend to stay and she and the FGs have had home-made pizza for tea. This is an incredibly easy pizza to make and very cheap! I made two big pizzas using this recipe:Mix a pound of SR flour with half a pint of water and 4tbsp oil and a pinch of salt. Mix until it all binds together and then knead for a few minutes. Then cut into two pieces and roll out to large discs. On top, they got a drained tin of chopped tomatoes (half on each pizza), half an onion finely chopped, on each and then 200g grated cheese divided between them. My kids love Pepperami, so I chopped up a couple of mini ones and that was the topping. They cook at 180C for about 15-20 minutes.Value flour does the job as well as the expensive stuff, so don't lash out on branded flour for this. Costing these pizzas, I think that the total cost for the two of them (one went in the freezer for another day) was about £2. It would be cheaper without the Pepperamis as they are the most expensive ingredient.Back in the garden, the FH made a start on the greenhouse. The aluminium frame has been put together, and shuttering has been made for a concrete base. It will not be able to go in the spot that we had first planned as the ground there is too hard to dig - we presume that there is a lot of builders' rubble around that area from when the houses were built. However, the new position is a good one and will be more convenient. There will be a photo when it is completed!"},
{"title": "Another day out!", "date": "Wednesday 27 August 2008", "text": "Yes - we got the planned day out, with a bit of a variation on the initial plan but I will come to that.  A later than planned departure meant that we arrived at Holkham at lunchtime, but since the Hall didn't open until 12, it wasn't a problem.  Sandwiches were eaten en route, and so we could pitch straight in when we arrived, although some visitors were enjoying very elaborate picnics under the trees where the cars were parked - there isn't really a car park at Holkham, one is just instructed to \"Park on the Grass\" and so it is haphazard and friendly.Holkham is a Palladian mansion house, and mansion is certainly the right word.  The FGs and I went round twice, once to just look and then again to do the kids' quiz sheets we were given.  The huge disappointment of the day was that, having just been told we were allowed to take photos inside the house, I discovered I had left the camera's memory card in the slot in the pc at home!  I was SO angry with myself as there were loads of great photo opportunities.  Still, a good excuse to go again...The YFG was fascinated to understand that this house, as opposed to the last two we visited, is still owned and lived in by the original family, in this case, the Earls of Leicester.  The current Earl has apparently recently moved out to allow his son, Viscount Coke, with wife and four children, to move in.  YFG was keenly watching to see whether she could spot any of the children around, as there were plenty of photos of them in the drawing room so we had a good idea what they look like.There is to be a 100th birthday party there tomorrow, and we saw a bedroom where guests will be sleeping - and it is a rather splendid bedroom.  The adjoining en-suite is remarkable though, because of the throne-like lavatory which graces one corner of it; it looks just like a large wooden throne, except that the lid lifts up and there is a handle for flushing discreetly positioned at the side.  Needless to say, that fascinated all of us as we just could not imagine using it.Leaving Holkham later in the afternoon, we made our way along the coast road to Hunstanton, as apparently the fish and chips there are preferred.  We had planned to go to Wells, but that was changed at the last minute.  The chap in the fish shop wound me up a little but perhaps it was his first day!  All I can say is that I hope he improves.  The meal was eaten on the seafront in the wind, which probably improves the taste.  Fresh air always does - and we had come prepared with salt, vinegar, ketchup and even the forks and plates so we were very civilised for seaside fish and chips. Several of us had a snooze on the way home but we have all had a good day.  Tomorrow promises more of a challenge as I have to hit the shoe shop with the FGs, and a school friend of YFG is coming for a sleepover - camping on the lounge floor and gossipping half the night, more than likely."},
{"title": "Success in seed shopping", "date": "Tuesday 26 August 2008", "text": "Thanks indeed to the people on the gardening forum at http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/ where I got the tip yesterday about the cheap seeds at Wyevale Garden Centres! We visited the Crowland branch today and went a little mad in the seed department!                                                                                      o0o                                                                           FH and I chose loads of seeds, both for things we know grow here, like dwarf beans, runner beans, various tomatoes, courgettes, cucumbers, and squash, as well as things we haven't tried before but hope to be successful - cape gooseberry, peppers, and onions for example.                                                                                       o0o                                                                         They were all 50p a packet - and we spent £17.55 as FH is entitled to an OAP discount, so that helped even more. Had we paid full price for the haul of seeds, we would have been charged £82.17!! There are enough for next year, and possibly some for 2010 as well. A truly successful day in the bargain hunting front."},
{"title": "Bank Holiday", "date": "Monday 25 August 2008", "text": "Gardening, gardening and more gardening, it seemed today.  The YFG and I spent the afternoon weeding three of the six garden beds, achieving some success, but there is still work to be done.  The soil we bought and used to make the beds seems to be disappearing and more organic material is needed in these beds, probably sooner rather than later.  We took a photo tonight to show a before and after scenario - the bed at the top has been weeded and we are in the process of doing the lower one.  I might get it done tomorrow, if the weather is fine in the evening.As I have mentioned before, we haven't planned far enough in advance this year, so we have some empty spaces now that some of the crops have been harvested.  In the top bed, though, we still have dwarf beans thriving alongside lettuce and some chard.  In the lower bed, there are some butternut squash plants, which have got some very small squashes on them and I have my fingers crossed that they will actually manage to ripen before the frosts start.  There are more lettuces there as well and some baby carrots.We did have the vegetarian meal that I thought about last night - it turned out to be a curry with courgettes, tomatoes, potatoes, green beans, mushrooms, onion and peppers.  The first four veg in that list are all home-grown, but the potatoes were grown by a friend and given to us.  It was a really great feeling to eat a meal in which we had produced so many of the ingredients.The FH thought that he would take the FGs to a local country show this afternoon but they returned home within 20 minutes of leaving, very disappointed.  The show was in the process of being taken apart, all the exhibitors were leaving or had already left and the whole thing had been a disaster for them.  It had been meant to run for the whole of the weekend but it seems that no-one came to the show - there were no \"customers\" so the exhibitors were packing up early and who can blame them??  One wonders whether this was a result of the current economic climate, and people just don't have the spare cash to attend this sort of show at the moment - or was it lack of publicity on the part of the organisers so that the general public were not really aware that it was on?  Personally, I suspect a bit of both!  There is another similar show not too far away next weekend, so perhaps we will go to that and try to see what is happening - I know that this one has been well advertised, so if there are not many people there, it is more likely to be lack of spare cash to spend!One of the white girls saying, \"Goodnight!\" after being put back in the hutch.  There are three white girls who are identical, so we have found it impossible to name them as we can't tell them apart!  They are quite thin and so we are trying to feed them up a bit.Tomorrow promises a busier day out and about - the FGs are doing sports, and the FH and I are going shopping for seeds at a garden centre that I have heard has reduced all its seeds to 50p a packet, so I am hoping that they still have some when I get there!  I heard that Lidl was going to have fruit bushes in last week but by the time I got there at lunchtime, they only had redcurrants, a white currant and some blueberry bushes left.   Will report back on whether this trip is more successful!"},
{"title": "Quiet day", "date": "Sunday 24 August 2008", "text": "Today started dismally with constant drizzle, so plans for a BBQ were quickly shelved. A good deal of sitting about, watching the Olympics ensued, whilst the family gathered themselves.Chickens and rabbits were fed - and a discovery was made! Our doe rabbit, Rosie, has given birth to her second litter of the year. We think that there might be four kits, but until they grow a little bigger, we are not going to disturb them. Patience is definitely a virtue. Her first litter are all grown up now, as they were born in May. They have not yet left home, as the FGs are reluctant to part with them - thank goodness that there were only four of them. Plans will have to be made soon, though, now that this second litter has arrived.The FH and FGs went out this afternoon to visit a relative. I watched some of the closing ceremony of the Olympics, and then cut the back lawn since the rain had stopped long enough for it to get dry. The BBQ was back on, so the gang bought some provisions on the way home and we got it all cooking for an outdoor meal tonight. The weather for August has been a bit of a challenge for BBQs, so we were pleased to have one tonight. However, too many wasps were around so we lit a couple of citronella candles - not convinced that they did a lot of good!Tonight, we have had a bouncing competition on the trampoline and been in fits of giggles until the gathering darkness forced us inside. Must get FH to replace the bulb in the outside light and we could have gone on longer!This coming week is looking busy as it is the last before the FGs go back to school. They have two days booked at a local school to do a sport day camp, and we have a little uniform shopping left to do - I hate shopping for their shoes as they both have wide feet and it is hard to find shoes for them. However, it has to be done, so that is on the list for this week. Weather permitting, we are hoping to have one last day out: we have our sights set on Holkham Hall on the north Norfolk coast and then fish and chips from nearby Wells-next-the-Sea. I haven't been to Holkham since my mother took me as a child, but you will see that it fits in with the historic theme of our earlier visits of the holidays so we may as well finish the way we started. We have only got Wednesday or Saturday to do that trip, because of the other commitments, so we will be watching the weather forecasts closely!If rain sets in, I am not sure whether there is a fall-back plan as we have already been to the cinema twice - the first to see \"Angus, Thongs and Perfect snogging\" (hilarious!!!) and then to watch \"Get Smart\" (even more hilarious!) so although numerous people are telling me to go to \"Mamma Mia\", I think that that may have to wait until I catch it on DVD.In the garden, we are picking tomatoes and dwarf beans like mad, eating as many as we can and freezing the rest. The chickens are growing so much that my dad has recommended more feed as he thinks that they are hungry all the time - so they are now on pellets twice a day and corn for a lunchtime snack - and they are eating it all, so he must be right. The layers are up to one egg each most days: we get six eggs from seven hens on five days out of seven, and five on other days, at the moment. They will start to lay less as the nights draw in, so we have to make the most of them whilst they are laying so prolifically.I think that we will be having a vegetarian day tomorrow after our meal tonight. I have been reading today about the amount of resources (water, grain, acreage, for example) needed to produce meat as opposed to vegetables and grains/legumes. It certainly made me think about cutting back on our purchased meat, and look forward to our own \"harvest\" of chicken."},
{"title": "Greenhouse", "date": "Saturday 23 August 2008", "text": "Building a greenhouse is in the list on the sidebar.  We have moved that on a bit today as Focus have an 8x6 aluminium framed greenhouse on offer.  Not one to follow the instructions in the packet, the Fen husband (FH) has decided to modify it somewhat and erect it as a 16x5 structure against a garage wall as a lean-to type.  The extra dimensions will be achieved with the addition of some wooden constructions, and we hope it will be ready within a week or two. The thought I had was that the FH would build a Dutch-light type greenhouse, but on pricing the glass, we found that it was going to cost in the region of £150 for that alone, never mind the wood.  The Focus one was £149, and we should end up with a much larger greenhouse than we had anticipated.Last week, the Fen girls and I had an afternoon out at Oxburgh Hall, near Downham Market in Norfolk.  The weather was great as in not too hot and not too fresh, and the company was good as we met up with the elder Fen girl's godfather and his daughter.  The house and gardens are owned by the National Trust, and since I have a family membership, the visit was \"free\".  I regard the membership as a donation to help to keep such national heritage available to us all, and so any visits we make are a bonus.  This one is well worth another trip sometime, as there is so much to see.  This is the gatehouse, where the King's Room, Queen's Room and Armoury are located.  There is a rather terrifying spiral stone staircase which links them.  It is terrifying to one such as myself who is scared of heights! Others clattered up and down quite happily.  The house was built in Tudor times, and is beautifully kept.The elder FG (EFG) attended a course at the University of Cambridge during the summer holidays so the younger FG (YFG) and I went to Wimpole Hall, near Arrington, just south of Cambridge on one of the days, and to the Fitzwilliam Museum on another day.  Wimpole is another NT property, so we are having our money's worth this year!  It was privately owned until relatively recently (the seventies, I think) by Rudyard Kipling's daughter and her husband.  The FGs like going to the Farm as well as the Hall, and so we started off this visit on the Farm, ate lunch there and then dashed back to the Hall in a downpour!The YFG asks the most pertinent questions - she asked the room stewards at Oxburgh and Wimpole about the toilets!  The woman at Oxburgh explained about chamber pots but the chap at Wimpole said that there are bathrooms there, we just don't see them all.  There is, though, a magnificent room where there is a sunken bath the size of a small swimming pool - my boiler would never cope with filling it!Going into Cambridge is an experience for the FGs.  The YFG loves escalators so when we entered the new John Lewis in the Grand Arcade, we just HAD to go all the way to the top and then back down again!  None of the shops in our local town even has an upstairs, so it was a treat for her to ride the escalators - she wanted to try the lifts too, but since they had a panoramic view over the city, I declined quite forcibly.  Poor deprived child......."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday 22 August 2008", "text": "We have kept chickens, on and off, for the past 15 years.  Our first trio were a gift from an old farmer in a Derbyshire village, and they travelled in the back of a van when we moved north of the Wash for a few years.  The cockerel was a source of amusement when they were fed and watered at service stations as he kept crowing - and you don't hear too many cockerels in the middle of motorway stopovers! Those three lasted a good few years, and when we moved down the road, we liberated half a dozen ex-battery hens from a nearby farm.  They had come to the end of their commercially-productive lives, and were being flogged off for £1 each.  Poor specimens they were, too, but they soon learned to perch, scratch in the garden and continued to lay eggs for several years. When we came back to the Fens, we lived in a town and didn't really consider hens again for a few years.  The longing to have some friendly chooks in the garden did come back, though, and we started off with some young Light Sussex bantams.  We thought we had bought a cockerel and four hens, but it soon became evident that we had more cockerels than hens, so the good people at Two Pots Bantams, near Cambridge, exchanged the excess cockerels.  Those bantams really did free-range around the garden, and so enamoured of the sight of them happily mooching in the garden was our neighbour that he went and bought some for himself - result! We added some Bovans Nera hens to the collection and the egg production really stepped up.  For a couple of years, then, we had about 12 of them in an average sized town garden - and the back of the garden opened up onto fields so we were sure to shut them safely up at night to keep them out of the jaws of the local fox. We thought about moving again, and we passed some of them onto some friends who were interested in keeping hens, and moved to the latest establishment with a reduced flock.  We HAD a cockerel, but one of the neighbours here objected to his wake-up calls and I got a friendly threat from the Environmental Health officer that I should do something to \"abate\" the noise, or she would be round to listen and if the complaint was upheld, I would be in court and made to get rid, so that cockerel is now happily running with a flock of happy hens within sight of Ely Cathedral. We have been here for four years now, and have now just had to register with DEFRA as we had got to the number at which registration is compulsory (50).  These chickens get addictive, and where we started with three, we now have about 43 - we sold some bantams shortly after registering with DEFRA.  The situation now is that we have seven large fowl as laying hens - four are Orpington crosses and three are hybrid hens.  We then have a pet Dutch bantam who is so friendly she will perch on your knee and fall asleep in the sun.  And then the rest of the numbers are made up of the grower flock. The grower flock are being raised for the pot.  They were bought as 5-day old chicks and raised under a lamp in the garage before being moved out onto grass, and then into a larger run.  It may seem harsh to some people and one of my sisters has already said that she couldn't eat a chicken she had looked after, but why not?  I know that these have had a good life, free to scratch and peck and have the kind of life chickens enjoy, free from any kind of pain and suffering.  They are a special breed from France, called \"Sasso\" by the hatchery, and most of them are white, which apparently makes for an unblemished skin when they are plucked.  I'll have to report back on that after the middle of October, when they will be about 16-17 weeks old and ready to be dispatched to the freezer.Bearing in mind their original cost and the feed costs over their lifetime, we estimate that they will have cost us about £5 each.  Yes, that is more expensive that your average \"cheap\" deals in the supermarkets where it has recently been possible to buy 2 for £6, but we are looking forward to eating a better quality chicken, and hoping to be able to taste the difference.  Guilt will not be on the menu as we know that the chickens' welfare has been the best I could possibly achieve. If this first experimental flock make it into the freezer successfully, we will then have to decide whether to do it all again.Without a cockerel, hatching more chicks off for the laying flock is more of a challenge - plenty of the hens (and the bantams which we had until recently) go broody but the eggs are not fertile, of course.  In the past, I have bought fertile eggs from friends, but this year that didn't work - one family were on holiday when my bants went broody and another friend has stopped poultry-keeping.  So I resorted to ebay.  I was doubtful about buying eggs through the post, so I looked for eggs being offered nearby, and found two ladies who would allow me to pick the eggs up in person, and I bought two lots from each of them.  One lady has Light and Buff Sussex large fowl and the other has Orpingtons.  We have 10 young birds from these hatchings.  One final bird went broody and I thought I would try something different, and risk the post as well, so I bid on some Scotch Dumpy eggs, but didn't win.  Barnvelders (\"Barneys\") were the next I tried and I won - so a dozen eggs came our way, very impressively packaged.  We have managed to get three successfully hatched, so I am a little disappointed, but I think that at least two of them are hens to add to the laying flock.  The cockerel will be grown on until he starts crowing and some one makes a complaint and then I shall have to put him in the freezer - maybe for Christmas!In the garden today, I have picked a good basket of fine, green beans which are now in the freezer.  The weather here has been showery all day and so we haven't done much else outside.  I am hoping to get some winter lettuce seeds sown before too long - and maybe spring cabbage as well."},
{"title": "Some progress, some problems", "date": "Thursday 21 August 2008", "text": "This growing year has been a short one for us.  We built the raised beds in the garden in May, on several hot, sunny days, shovelling soil for hours.  Plants were grown from seed, bartered for with friends and relatives, and bought from a local nursery.  By the middle of June, the first four beds were full, and the brassicas were carefully netted against the marauding cabbage white butterfly.  Eventually, two further beds were constructed and we have a total of six, in a good position in the middle of the garden so they are in the sun for most of the day.  The soil is thin, though and does not seem to hold moisture very well, so they need to be watered on dry days, although there haven't been too many of those this summer!  The best crops for us this summer have been courgettes, dwarf beans, peas, and mixed salad leaves.  The brassicas were a complete disaster - the nets were touching the leaves so the butterflies were able to land and lay eggs, which then hatched into a vast, hungry army of caterpillars.  They pretty swiftly munched their way through cabbages, cauliflower plants, calabrese, etc and the lot have been left as spiny plants with no leaves.  They have had to be pulled up, needless to say.  Tomatoes have grown well in troughs in a sheltered position, and we are already planning to grow more next year.Next year, we need to make preparations for successive plantings after the first crop has been lifted - we haven't planned far enough this year and now we have areas lying empty.One of the beds should end up holding soft fruit next year - we are hoping for strawberries, raspberries and gooseberries.  The latter will be for jam-making and the others for eating fresh and for freezing.  Two generations ago, my family never ate bananas or oranges, which I found strange, but now I understand - they had a very productive garden where they grew soft fruit (strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, currants) and tree fruit (apples, pears, plums) and so with careful preservation, they had their own fruits available to eat in one form or another all year round.  This is a plan that I am hoping to get some way towards.Enough about the garden.  Tomorrow I will talk about the chickens and the rabbits.You might well ask what we are growing - well, it is more that you may expect.  In the most basic sense of the word, we are growing vegetables, fruit trees, chickens and rabbits (although \"raising\" would be a better word in their case!) and too much grass.However, in a broader sense, we are developing our lives in other ways - we have a growing family, and we have some areas of our lives that could do with some progress.  A couple of us need to grow a little leaner, we all need to get tidier (we can do \"clean\" but we aren't so hot on \"tidy\") and we are aiming to become more self-sufficient and careful with our resources as a means to conserving our energy and finances.  We are debt-free but now want to build on that for our children's future.  We have recently returned to church attendance and we are growing in our diligence to that, and getting to know other members of the church.We are beginners in many things and have a lot to learn so we hope we can share as we go!"}
